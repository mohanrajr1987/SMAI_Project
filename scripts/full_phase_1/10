Positive 10 pSo Im just starting to learn about recursion and Im confused as to how avoid this problem.  I will write a function that needs to store a variable, like a sum, but I have to declare the variable in the function so every time the recursive call is made the variable gets initialized again.  How can I fix this I think a helper function of some short but Im not really sure. p

Positive 10 pI am having an issue with getting a user string passed in as a variable parsed so that each word is in its own variable. Below is my attempt at this, there is another part of the program called client.c that is requesting user input, once I type in a string in the client foo 123 anwhere blah it gets passed into the server program below as the variable buf. Once I have it I make a copy of it into temp so I dont damage the original string at least at this point in testing. Then I run the strctok against the variable trying to parse out each word.p  pIf im even on the right track with this at the moment it will compile with no errors and run, however when I send data to it from the client it throws a segmentation fault core dumped, can anyone shed any light as to whyp  pTHANK YOUp  precode           server.c   include ltstdio.hgt include ltiostreamgt include ltstrings.hgt include ltsystypes.hgt include ltsyssocket.hgt include ltnetinetin.hgt include ltarpainet.hgt  include ltnetdb.hgt include ltcstringgt include ltcstdlibgt  using namespace std  define SERVERPORT 1617  define MAXPENDING 5 define MAXLINE 256  int mainint argc, char argv   struct sockaddrin sin socklent addrlen char buf[MAXLINE] int len int s int news char temp char fname[32], lname[32], city[32], zip[32], country[32]   build address data structure  bzerochar ampsin, sizeofsin sin.sinfamily  AFINET sin.sinaddr.saddr  INADDRANY sin.sinport  htons SERVERPORT   setup passive open  if  s  socket AFINET, SOCKSTREAM, 0 lt 0      perrorsocket     exit1   if binds, struct sockaddr  ampsin, sizeofsin lt 0      perrorbind     exit1   listen s, MAXPENDING  addrlen  sizeofsin cout ltlt The server is up, waiting for connection ltlt endl   wait for connection, then receive and print text  while 1      if news  accepts, struct sockaddr ampsin, ampaddrlen lt 0          perroraccept         exit1          cout ltlt new connection from  ltlt inetntoasin.sinaddr ltlt endl      while len  recvnews, buf, sizeofbuf, 0           temp  buf         strcpyfname, strtokbuf ,               strcpylname, strtokNULL,               strcpycity , strtokNULL,               strcpyzip , strtokNULL,               strcpycountry, strtokNULL,                 printfsn, fname             printfsn, lname             printfsn, city             printfsn, zip             printfsn, country            send news, temp, strlentemp  1, 0            closenews  codepre  p                                                                      p

Positive 10 pIve been asked to compute the average depth of a node in both a binary search tree, and an AVL tree.

Positive 10 pIve been learning how Linked Lists work,and started building an implementation in C to reinforce the concepts. It was going well until I made a function to remove all nodes. I figured out a solution which is the commented code but I cant seem to figure out why the other code didnt work. p  pThe Node object is an instance of a class that was created using new. Therefore delete is used to, well, delete it.p  pI thought it may have been related to deleting the object and reusing the pointer variable. Then I came across this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions23621677whathappenstothepointeritselfafterdeleteWhat happens to a pointer itself after deletea  Ive been staring at it for a while trying to figure out what it could be, and nothing I have researched seems to be providing an answer. p  pI dont believe it is something with my implementation so far because the programs works as expected when replacing the code with the solution code. p  pThe code outputs every address, but it doesnt seem to actually delete the object. If I run the program in Windows, the program will actually lock and never leave the while loop. Not an infinite loop, it just gets stuck and the function never finishes. If I run it on C4Droid the program doesnt lock, but the nodes still exist after the function exits. p  pSo my question is, why doesnt the current code work Ignore the commented code.

Even so, we would have the required branches locally, and well be able to compile our sources.p  pBut, we usually commit quite often, and need to rebasemerge often.

Normally, we could iyelli at each other each time we access the remote repo , but it would be better to have it secured by the computersnetwork.p  pAnd, it is possible that GIT has an internal mechanism to do this since someone can push to one of your repos, while you work on it, but I havent found anything conclusive yet.p  pbUpdate 2bbr br  The repo on the share drive would be a bbareb repo, not containing a working copy.p

I begrudgingly took the task up to learn a bit of web stuff to implement a snazzy UI.

So I bought the giant OReilly Definitive Guide and read through it. Wanted to know more, so I got the Douglas Crockford book JS The Good Parts and went through his website  wow now I just blew away my previous understanding of JS prototypal inheritance I was doing it the new way and damn, design patterns and unit testing frameworks in this language too Javascript really must be more serious than I thought With this newfound background Im going through the jQuery library and dissecting its guts.p  pI dont know where to go from here though.

Negative 10 pIm having a lot of trouble making jQuerys autocomplete widget work for me. I am using a list of keyvalue pairs from a server. p  pI have the following requirementsp  pIf the user selects a value from the widget, I want to pass the ID to the server. p  pIf the user doesnt select a value and enters raw text, or modifies a value that has already been selected, I want the ID field to be cleared and just the raw text to be sent to the server.p  pAssume that codesomeAjaxFunctioncode returns an array of objects that the autocomplete widget expects codelabellabel, valuekeycode.p  pInitially I set the autocomplete widget up like sop  precodeinput.autocomplete     source sourceFunction,     minLength 1  codepre  pChanging the selection even by hovering over one of the items changes the text in the text box referenced by input to the underlying key, rather than the label. This is highly undesirable from a user interaction point of view  indeed, the very reason why I am investigating this is because the users of the site I am building were consistently baffled by the text they entered seemingly turning into random numbersp  pI added a hidden field under the text box and implemented the select and focus events in order to cloak the ID like sop  precodeinput.autocomplete     source sourceFunction,     minLength 1     focus functionevent, ui          idField.valui.item.value         this.valui.item.label         return false     ,     select functionevent, ui          idField.valui.item.value         this.valui.item.label         return false     ,     minLength 1  codepre  pThis works well when the user is sticking to the script provided by the autocomplete dropdown. The ID is cloaked and correctly submitted to the server. Unfortunately, if the user wants to enter some freeform text into the box and search based on that value, the ID field is not reset and the previously selected ID gets submitted to the server. This is also rather confusing.p  pThe jQuery UI Autocomplete documentation lists a codechangecode event and states that the codeitemcode property of the codeuicode argument will be set to the selected item. I figured I could reset the hidden id field on a key press and repopulate the ID if the autocomplete is changed. Unfortunately, in addition to the keypress event capturing a whole bunch of keypresses that emshouldntem reset the ID, the codereturn falsecode statement in the above codeselectcode event which is necessary to manage the text in the text box prevents the codechangecode event from having ui.item properly assigned.p  pSo now Im stuck  I dont really know what else I can try to make the widget support functionality that it seems like it should support by default. Either this process is way more complicated than it should be, or Im missing something really obvious. Ive picked through all the available events and all the examples and come up empty handed. In fact, even the Custom data and display example on the jQuery UI page suffers from this problem.p  pI can add some hacks at the server side to cover for this, but I would really prefer to be able to do this at the client level.p  pI would also prefer to stick to the jQuery UI autocomplete widget rather than switch to another one. p

Negative 10 pI am troubled with the following concept Most booksdocs describe how robust servers are multithreaded and that the most common approach is to start a new thread to serve each new client. E.g. a thread is dedicated to each new connection. But how is this actually implemented in big systems If we have a server that accepts requests from 100000 clients, it has started 100000 threads Is this realistic Arent there limits on how many threads can run in a server Additionally the overhead of context switching and synchronization, doesnt it degrade performance Is it implemented as a mix of queues and threads In this case is the number of queues fixed Can anybody enlighten me on this, and perhaps give me a good reference that describes thesep  pThanksp

Negative 10 pI am preparing unit tests for DAO layer which interacts with entity objects for persistence in to database. p  pTechnology Hibernate Java 1.6 JUnitp  pSuppose i want to create test method addEntityAp  pfor doing so i create EntityA object. Now problem is EntityA is child of EntityB. So i must specify reference of EntityB in EntityA. EntityA will be persisted in database only if EntityB is persisted first. So thus to test persistnece of EntityA i will have test persistence of EntityB. this way it can lead to chain of entities which must be persisted before actual persistence of EntityA for testing. One may argue that i should give reference of EntityB object which is already persisted. But problem is that i dont want to make test cases dependent upon test in database rather than test data. Some how i resembles with what JMock solves but not sure how and if Jmock can be useful herep  pPlease let me know if problem is not clear p

Negative 10 pIn spring the HibernateTransactionManager uses the SessionFactory it was initialised with to bind a Session to the current thread context when creating a new transaction.  Then when HibernateTemplate is used it find that bound Session and uses it.p  pHowever I found today that HTM also binds its transaction to the underlying DataSource as well as the SessionFactory if possible.  This allows code to use JdbcTemplate within the transaction scope and, provided the DataSource used by JdbcTemplate is the same as the SessionFactory uses, the Jdbc operations will participate in the transaction using the same underlying Connection.p  pThis bit me quite badly today when I had some code in my hibernate id allocator that was creating a DataSourceTransactionManager and JdbcTemplate to allocate ids out of a highlo table.  I was intending that this be a standalone transaction that would fetch the next high number and then commit the change to the id table.  However because of the above behaviour it was actually participating in my outer hibernate transaction AND even worse committing it early.  Suffice to say not good.p  pI tried playing around with transaction propogation settings used REQUIRESNEW but this didnt help.p  pDoes anyone know the best way to use JdbcTemplate within a hibernate transaction and NOT have them share a transaction, even tho they share the same DataSourcep  pEDITp  pI have a SessionFactory S which is created by the spring LocalSessionFactoryBean using a DataSource D.

Negative 10 pThis is a followup to a question I posted yesterday a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5790617howtoreferenceiconsinsideresxfilesfromxamlherea. Binding to icons works, using the codesnippet posted by H.B., but I cant seem to figure out how to add a trigger condition to it so that a different icon will be displayed on mouseover. The current code looks like thisp  precode    xmlnsresclrnamespaceMyProject.Resources     xmlnsHelpersclrnamespaceMyProject.Converters     ...     ltImage NameimgMin            Grid.Column0            StretchUniformToFill            CursorHand             MouseDownimgMinMouseDowngt         ltImage.Sourcegt             ltBinding SourcexStatic resAppResources.minimizegt                 ltBinding.Convertergt                     ltHelpersIconToImageSourceConvertergt                 ltBinding.Convertergt             ltBindinggt         ltImage.Sourcegt     ltImagegt codepre  pWhat do I need to change here so that a different icon resAppResources.minimizeglow is displayed on mouseover I tried messing around with getting a trigger in there somewhere, but Image.Source doesnt accept another child, Binding doesnt support direct content, changing Image.Source to Image.Style doesnt work because Style cannot contain Binding... Im running out of ideas here, and my Googlefu is failing to come up with anything useful. Besides, even if I could get a Trigger to work with this, putting a Binding to the highlighted icon into the Trigger would probably be my next headache. There has to be a way to do this, rightp

Negative 10 pSo I am working on a project where a client discovered a problem on a site a previous developer built for them. They found that the Scribd iPaper module loads up secure documents fine in Firefox, Safari, and Chrome but not in Internet Explorer.p  pIn IE the darn thing just doesnt load. The site is using the Drupal iPaper module which was funded by Scribd I believe. It is using the Flash reader for secure documents. I would switch it over to using the newer HTML5 reader, however they need the document to be secured and the HTML5 reader does not offer a feature for that.p  pI have dug around on the Internet for answers and found nothing of use. I suspected a possible CSS or JS related issue we all know how obnoxious IE can be, but when I removed all of both from the page the results stayed the same.p  pI then tried to find an alternative solution and found Embedit.in. Made a PHP Library and a Drupal module and then as of Monday of this week their service started going on the fritz no longer converting uploaded files, they claim server problems. I looked into docstoc, but in order to use their API you have to email them since they disabled the request form due to spam problems. I have emailed them but with no reply. I even offered to share a PHP library and Drupal module that I will make and maintain myself with them and the world which is what I intended to do with Embedit.in too.p  pI also looked into the option of using an embed code to directly load a PDF in the browser. Works great in everything except Firefox has problems getting the right plugin and doesnt default to the Adobe Flash plugin like all the other browsers.p  pI have also tried compiling PDF2SWF on my Mac with no luck. I am not even sure if I could use that on the servers and I dont have SSH access to the prod server anyway Subversion deployment only.p  pI am getting to the end of my ropes here. Anyone have any solutions for mep  pI need the following abilitiesp  ol liSecure the documentsli liDisplay in IE, FF, and Safari on Windows and Macli liDisplay directly in the browser without requiring the user to download an extra plugin beyond Flash.li liBe able to set it up programmatically and this has to work with PDFs.li ol  pThanksp

Negative 10 pWith 1001 possibilities to use MySQL, Ive come up with a requirement for myself that I want to figure out, but dont know how.

Negative 10 pIf I have a subview built in Interface Builder, and I want to give it an actual name, I presume the only way to do this is to create a UIView instance variable in my view controller, and then do something like thisp  precode voidviewDidLoad  [super viewDidLoad] self.moveView[self.view.subviews objectAtIndex0]     self.moveView.backgroundColor[UIColor redColor]  codepre  pIn so doing, I can now work with this subview using a conventional name, moveView, rather than addressing it by its index number within the view heirarchy.p  pIs this is good way of doing something like this outside of actually using a custom view classp  pAnother way that is perhaps easier and does not require that you figure out the index number seems to be just creating a UIView property IBOutlet and assigning that to the Interface Builder and doing thisp  precodeproperty nonatomic, retain IBOutlet UIView  sensitivity codepre  pin interface.p  pHowever, I want to know if the retain quality of this property means that my UIView is essentially using up double the memory, since doesnt the Interface Builder UIView also store this in memory Or will hooking this up in IB make these one and the same, with just a singe actual UIView instancep

Negative 10 pI am a fairly experienced midlevel developer that has spent quite a bit of time working on the backend of many webbased projects. Rarely getting into the uidisplay aspects. However, I am now a lead on a project that is in the process of taking an api to a service architecture using an asp.net mvc rest architecture. I have not problem doing this and have written many of these services already. however, I find myself wondering about the parts hidden by IISWAS and MVC.p  pWhat I am hoping to find is a good tutorial that explains what happens from the point a web page or webservice is requested to the point it is received by the web page or application takes over. I want to know how IIS or any other webserver knows what to do with a request. One thought was a tutorial for developing your own webserver.p  pI realize this is probably a large subject that I dont necessarily need to know all of to be an expert web developer. However, it certainly cant hurt and I also am experienced enough to separate the wheat from the chaff.p  pThanks in advancep

However, the next time I call the codedialogandParamsandDelegatecode method, it goes straight to the share dialog, and it works fine.p  pMy question is, why is the dialog being completely dismissed when I try to log in Im not doing anything with the session before displaying the dialog, because it seems like it should handle that itself, right Or do I explicitly have to handle a logged out session, so it displays the dialog correctlyp
Negative 10 pIm making a jQuery UI dialog around an iframe element and the performance of doing so is severely affected. The issue appears when you move the dialog around too fast which causes your mouse to go over the iframe element, the entire page will hang for a moment and cause a notable slowdown. I have read about the iframe capturing mouse events which is causing the slow down but I cannot seem to determine the exact issue. I tried to capture mousemove and mouseover and prevent default behaviour, no luck.p  pAny pointers to get the performance back on track would be appreciated Also note that Im using Webkit and dont care about compatability with other browsers.p

Negative 10 pI am trying to understand the EXIF header portion of a jpeg file in hex and how to understand it so I can extract data, specifically GPS information.  For better or worse, I am using VB.Net 2008 sorry, it is what I can grasp right now.  I have extracted the first 64K of a jpg to a byte array and have a vague idea of how the data is arranged.  Using the EXIF specification documents, version 2.2 and 2.3, I see that there are tags, that are supposed to correspond to actual byte sequences in the file.  I see that there is a GPS IFD that has a value of 8825 in hex.  I search for the hex string 8825 in the file which I understand to be two bytes 88 and 25 and then I believe that there is a sequence of bytes following the 8825.  I suspect that those subsequent bytes denote where in the file, by way of an offset, the GPS data would be located.  For example, I have the following hex bytes, starting with 88 25  88 25 00 04 00 00 00 01 00 00 05 9A 00 00 07 14.  Is the string that I am looking for longer than 16 bytes  I get the impression that in this string of data, it should be telling me where to find the actual GPS data in the file.p  pLooking at a hrefhttpsearch.cpan.orgbettelliImageMetaDataJPEG0.153libImageMetaDataJPEGStructures.podExifandDCT relnofollowhttpsearch.cpan.orgbettelliImageMetaDataJPEG0.153libImageMetaDataJPEGStructures.podExifandDCTa, halfway down the page, it talks about Each IFD block is a structured sequence of records, called, in the Exif jargon, Interoperability arrays.

Negative 10 pI have an ASP.net MVC3 application. In one of my controllers there is a action for sending SMS to some Users of our application.

Negative 10 pI am designing a cloud app and need a worker process which scours my database looking for work, and then performs it.p  pMost of the info I seem to find on the subject of background tasks in the cloud involves some kind of scheduler andor queuing system.p  pWhat I have doesnt quite fit into the run this task every 5 minutes or add this to the queue to be executed later models. I think the main difference to my problem is that the workers themselves find work to do, rather than being assigned it by a periodic scheduler or an external process that generates work.p  pWhat I have is basically a giant table where each entry has three fields p  ol licodejobcode a small task to be performed, lets say it gets the last message from a twitter account and stores it in the databaseli lithe codeintervalcode at which to perform that job say every 5 minutes, N.B. the interval is arbitrary and different for each entry in the tableli lithe last codedatecode when the job was performedli ol  pThe way I would implement this is to have a worker which has an infinite loop. When it enters the loop, it scours the database alooking for items whose codedate  interval lt currentTimecode, bwhen it finds one, it sets codedate  currentTimecode, and cthen executes the job. If there is no work ATM, it sleep for a few seconds, then tries again.p  pI will have many parallel workers scouring the database simultaneously, which is why I do b first and then c in the paragraph above. Since there are parallel workers, action a and b are atomic operations on the database to prevent work being duplicated. If the worker crashes after a and b, but before it manages to finish the work, its no big deal, and the workers can just do it at the next interval reason for this is that the work is not performed in a timeinvariant system so a backlog scenario of failed jobs has no benefit as the tasks have to be performed at their exact intervals, so its better to skip 1 interval than to have uneven intervals between which the tasks were executed.p  pMy question is whether that is a reasonable implementation strategy If so, how do I bring this process to life on the cloud I am using Heroku, but may switch to EC2 in the future I still havent written any code so I would welcome other suggestions maybe I misunderstood the use casesapplications for queue systems.p

It makes sense to me to use an image for the arrow, then rotate it so it points in the correct direction as home gets moved around.p  pHere is my fiddle with the base work  a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netvirtuapeteQVQ5r1 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netvirtuapeteQVQ5r1ap  pSo there are 3 elements to this to make it work properly... the image following home as it moves around in overflow, rotation of the image with respect to where home is so the arrow always points to home and then simply hiding the arrow once home becomes visible within the container.p  pI am pretty sure I have seen this effect before and to begin tackling the issue I started looking up scroll follow techniques since that would be a close 1dimensional example of this concept.  Kind of like a multidirectional scroll follow almost.  I have reached the point where I have completely confused myself now and I am def not strong enough in my skills to meld diff code snippets I have found into the desired result yetp  pI found a jsfiddle  a hrefhttpjsfiddle.nethj57k relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.nethj57ka  of something that could be along the lines of what I want, without the div following the object in that example the cursor once it has left the container boundaries.  Any help would be amazing as i am just stuck on how to get going... getting the div to follow the object around the sides would be a great start and I could probably take it from there...p

Negative 10 pI am writing a program to store data to a file on the unit of every 32 bits i.e. 4 bytes at a time. I wrote the code in 64bit windows system but the compiler I used is 32 bits mingw32.

However, I found that the size of int or long are different and depending on the system. Is that any way like using a macro in the header file to determine the size of an integer so to decide if int or long should be used as the data type in the code I have to recompile the code in 4 different type of system, it is really a headache if I modify the code to have 4 different copies for each system.p

Negative 10 pI am playing HTTP Live Streaming on the iOS device family, using Apples AVPlayer library on iOS 5 and 6.p  pSince I am playing advertisements midroll, between content clips, I am using the EXTXDISCONTINUITY tags, as suggested by the awesome person who helped answer a previous question. p  pThis has been working for a single bitrate, but I am getting problems strongonlystrong when using a variant playlist with child playlists for multiple bitrates. I am getting a black screen with audio only after the very first discontinuity tag, and it never recovers even after the ad is over. I can hear the ad.p  pThis has been tested and reproduced on an iPhone 4, 4S, 5, and iPod Touch 4th gen. The iphone 4 is on iOS 5, the rest are iOS 6. It happens most of the time, but not every single time. But for sure, I want to emphasize that strongthis only happens if my variant playlist contains more than one bitrate child playlist.strongp  pHere is an example of a playlist that I use this is the 400kbps version, and I have a  200 and 800kbps version with corresponding playlists that look exactly like the following, but replace all 400s with 200 and 800. Well, the actual playlist is longer but this is an example.p  precodeEXTM3U EXTXTARGETDURATION10 EXTXMEDIASEQUENCE0 EXTINF10, 400clipA0.ts EXTINF10, 400clipA1.ts EXTINF5, 400clipA2.ts  EXTXDISCONTINUITY EXTINF10, 400advert0.ts EXTINF3, 400advert1.ts  EXTXDISCONTINUITY EXTINF10, 400clipB0.ts EXTINF10, 400clipB1.ts EXTINF5, 400clipB2.ts  EXTXENDLIST codepre  pAnd I have the variant playlist that selects between the child playlistsp  precodeEXTM3U EXTXSTREAMINFPROGRAMID1,BANDWIDTH240000 clips200.m3u8 EXTXSTREAMINFPROGRAMID1,BANDWIDTH440000 clips400.m3u8 EXTXSTREAMINFPROGRAMID1,BANDWIDTH840000 clips800.m3u8 codepre  pNote that what happens 75 of the time is that when I play this, the video will go to black after the very first discontinuity tag right before the ad and never recover again, although I can hear the audio of the ad. For example, if I made my variant playlist with only a single bitrate variantp  precodeEXTM3U EXTXSTREAMINFPROGRAMID1,BANDWIDTH280000 clips200.m3u8 codepre  pThen I do not get this problem at all Very strange. Additionally, if I remove all the discontinuity tags and still keep the other bitrates in the variant playlist, then it works fine usually, but occasionally it will skip an entire .ts file for some reason, probably because it needs those discontinuity tags.p  pAdditionally, this happens more often when I play the files directly on Amazon Cloudfront, compared to from the Amazon S3 bucket where they originally reside.p  pSome other info that might help My original files clips and ads are all .mov files taken from an iPhone 4, with the same resolution on each. My outputs the .ts files were all then generated from these  for each bitrate class, I have the same encoding settings across the clips and ads. Outputs are all the same resolution and framerate otherwise.p  pOne last thing, the mediasegmentvalidator provided by Apple does not give any warnings when I use it to check.p  pI really appreciate any help that you guys can offer This is a puzzling problem for me p

Negative 10 pIm working on somewhat large application that is divided into groups by functionality. Since every functionality is mostly independent they all use the same database, but there is no direct interaction between different functionalities, Im using the user defined controls and treating them as individual applications. The way the application works is thisp  ul liThe root application only contains the main menu and 2 panels. The main menu is used to select the group of functionalities.li liAfter the group is selected on application startup the first group is automatically selected, the functionalities represented by buttons from that group are displayed in the first panel.li lipThe user selects the functionality by clicking on the appropriate button heshe wants and the user control that contains the form is displayed in the second panel. The code that displays all of the user controls looks like thisp  precode    panel2.Controls.Clear     UserControl1 uc1  new UserControl1     uc1.Location  new Point0, 0     panel2.Controls.Adduc1     label6.Text  User control 1 codepreli ul  pSo, when the user selects one of the functionalities, the application clears existing controls, and displays the selected one. The application works fine the part I implemented so far, so this is my question  how does this approach manage computer resources, mainly the memory. Specifically, if the user uses one functionality, and then switches to another one, will the .NETs services release the memory used by the previous functionality I think garbage collector is in charge of that and will the SQL connections, that I use to communicate with the database, be closed Also, are there some other issues that I should be aware of As I said, the functionalities work properly, but Im still very far from full testing of the application as a whole I only test every functionality individually when I create it, and only on the computer I create it on, so I cant consider it as a proper testing. Because of that, I am worried that the applications performances might deteriorate if the application is constantly used over a longer period of time. Im using VS 2010 C and SQL Server 2005 to create this application. If you have any suggestions, please write them. With this question, Im trying to prevent major reconstructions of the application once it comes to the phase of testing and implementing due to bad resource management. Thanks.p

Negative 10 pI was working on a forum component for a bigger project and considered adding in a hellban feature where a mod may prevent a users posts from being viewed by anyone but that user. This basically enforces the dont feed the troll rule, forcing everyone to ignore the troublemaker. Meanwhile the troublemaker likely becomes bored as he doesnt succeed in getting a rise out of anyone and hopefully moves on. p  pMy first thought was to add in a hellbanned column in a post table, and create a hellbanend table. A hellbanned user would have their userid added as a record to the hellbanned table, and henceforth all their future posts would have their hellbanned column set to true. p  pSo a query showing all a topics posts would simply show all posts where hellbanned  False. And, a post operation would check if the user was in the hellban table, and if so, set the posts hellbanned column to True.p  pI cant help but thinking there is a better way to do this Id really appreciate some suggestions.p

Negative 10 pIm having some issues with a website that only occur in Safari. Im running version 5.1.7 7534.57.2 on a Mac. p  pYou can view the site here a hrefhttpmcad.eduannualreport201112 relnofollowhttpmcad.eduannualreport201112a. p  pThe website is parallax scrolling, with a relative positioned content div that holds everything, including the 3 parallax scrolling backgrounds which are all fixed, top and left set to 0. p  pWithin the fixed parallax background containers, colorized images fade into full color images when a user mouses over them. For each image, there are two divs stacked, each with background images that are positioned by backgroundposition. The div on the bottom has the colorized image. The div on top has the full color image as a background and has its opacity set to 0 until mouseover. The fade is achieved using a CSS transition on the opacity property so that the top div becomes visible.p  pSo, in Safari only, when I mouse over any of these divs, the transition occurs smoothly but all of the content in the same parallax scrolling background div shiftsjumps in the process. If I remove the CSS transition, this does not occur.  p  pI think that it might have something to do with the transitionwebkittransition property not playing nicely with a fixed position container in Safari. However, all of the issues Ive found that relate to that are from 2010 and mention a Safari bug that I assume has been fixedtwo years later. But maybe not. p  pTheres also another issue with the Catalyst section 3rd dot down on the right navigation. These animated images work as links in Chrome, Firefox and Opera, but not Safari. Any ideasp
Negative 10 pSharePoint 2010 Lists Web Service UpdateList fails with Attempted to use an object that has ceased to exist...but it DOES exist. p  pI would like to update an attribute for existing fields.

Three test cases are shown below. The first is the failure. The second shows a mismatched name results in a different error. The third shows how to delete the field by Name. p  pAny ideas on where to go next Might there be a special permission to update a field beyond being able to delete that same field Although I am subsite owner, I am not a SharePoint admin or server admin.

Negative 10 pIve been uploading apps to the Google Play for a couple of months now. Ive added Admob banner ads in all of my 30apps. Im getting my first payment this month, and Ill get a big one 2000 in January.p  pSo, Ive been doing my research. Ive found AdMob closed LOTS of profitable accounts this year, so Im a bit scared. Im following their rules no fraud clicks, banner always at the bottom of the app shown in a fixed region, no matter if ad is served or not.p  pMy only but is the refresh rate. Admob RECOMMENDS applying a 60 second refresh rate. I load an ad in every onCreate call of all my Activities. So, if an user enters my app in Activity A and Ad will be shown. If 5 seconds later, he navigates to Activity B, another Ad will be served.p  pI developed a while ago an static function, based on shared preferences, which doesnt allow the app to request an Ad faster than once in X seconds. That solves your problem Nope.p  pMost of my aps have 4 or 5 Activities, one of them is shown 8090 of time. I dont want the Ad to be server for an activity that is shown 2 or 3 seconds and then I wouldnt ask for another ad in the main activity because I still need to wait another 57 seconds.p  pI wonder how you guys solved this issue, I cant be the only want fighting against this.p

Negative 10 pIm developing an app using Jquery Mobile and Phonegap.  The issue that I have is that when I do a page transition, the incoming page first appears incorrectly DOM elements not in the right position nor the right size, then once the transition is complete, the elements resize and move to the correct position.  Also, the page transitioning out also appears incorrectly before it moves out.  I have tested this using both fade and slide transitions I would like to have slide transitions ultimately.p  pHere is a jsFiddle illustrating the problembr a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netfz7qs2httpjsfiddle.netfz7qs2ap  pI am also using a div as a page container so that the entire page is not transitioning at once, but just the page container div.p  pI am using css percentages for pretty much everything heights, widths, margins, etc so that the app will scale to different device sizes.  Additionally, I am using javascript to center some elements fired on pageshow event.  I think these percentages are part of the problem.  I constructed a simple test on a desktop browser taking out phonegap and set a fixed height to the page container.  This seemed to fix the problem, but when I tried it on my phone, the issue was still there.  p  pEach page in the app is preloaded into the DOM using .mobile.loadPage.  I figured if I preload them, the percentage height would be relative to the parent the page container div and the transitions should look correct.p  pLooking into Jquery Mobile further, I found that during a transition, the height of the page was set to an empty string.  I tried to comment out this line just to test to see if it would work with percentage heights.  Again, it worked on my desktop test, but not on the phone.p  pI am using Android phonegap API level 8  Android 2.2 on a Samsung Galaxy Nexus to test.p  pIs there any way to have the css and javascript positioning applied before the page transitions while keeping percentage based valuesp  pbindex.htmlbp  precodeltbodygt     lt header on every page gt     ltdiv idmainHeadergtThis is a headerltdivgt      lt page content gt     ltdiv idpageContainergt         ltdiv datarolepagegtltdivgt     ltdivgt ltbodygt codepre  pbpage1.htmlbp  precodeltbodygt      ltdiv datarolepage idpage1gt         ltdiv classsubheadergt             ltdiv classbackButtongtltdivgt             ltdiv classsubheaderTextgtSettingsltdivgt             ltdiv classhelpButtongtltdivgt         ltdivgt     ltdivgt ltbodygt codepre  pbrelevant cssbp  precodepageContainer      overflow hidden     width 100     height 86.772486772486772486772486772487   .uimobile [datarolepage]      minheight 0px important     color white     position relative     width 100     height 100     background 868a73   .subheader      width 100     height 10.16260162601626016260162601626     backgroundcolor 000     display inlineblock     textalign center     position relative   .backButton      background urlimagesbackbutton.png     backgroundsize contain     backgroundrepeat norepeat     display inlineblock     float left     width 8.888888888888888888888888888889     height 52     marginleft 5.555555555555555555555555555556   .subheaderText      color FFF     fontsize 2.45em     fontweight bold     display inlineblock   .helpButton      float right     background urlimageshelpbutton.png     backgroundsize contain     backgroundrepeat norepeat     display inlineblock     width 8.888888888888888888888888888889     height 64     right 5.555555555555555555555555555556  codepre

I get around 1200 fps when looking so close at a grid that every pixel ends up in the same close grid item.p  pAlthough I understand that doing this loop for every pixel is some work, it still is some easy basic math, especially now that I have removed the texturelookup and have just used a simple test, so I dont understand why this has to slow everything down so hard. My GPU has 16 cores and runs at 700Mhz. I am rendering at 960x540, 518400 pixels. It should be able to handle much more than this I would think.p  pIf I remove the antialiasing part of the above the part of code where I will test some extra adjacent points based on the increaser value, it is a little better 100fps, but come on, with these calculations, it shouldnt make much difference If I split the code so that increaser is not used but the below code is done for every different part, the framerate stays the same. If I change some ints to floats, nothing changes.p  pI have done much more intensive andor complicated shaders before, so why is this one so terribly slow Can anyone tell what calculation I do makes it go so slowp  pI am not setting uniforms that are not used or something like that, the Ccode is also doing nothing more than just rendering.

Negative 10 pI have been experimenting with generating sequence files for Hadoop outside the Java framework, Python to be specific.  There is a pythonhadoop module which provides mostly similar framework to do this.  I have successfully created sequence files using it the generated sequence files can be copied to HDF and be used as input for Hadoop jobs.  LZO and Snappy are fully configured on my local Hadoop installation, and I can generate proper compressed sequence files with those algorithms when I do so via org.apache.hadoop.io.SequenceFile.createWriter on Java.p  pHowever, it seems that valid sequence files are not generated when I try LZO or Snappy as the block compression scheme on pythonhadoop.  Im using a similar scheme as in this codep  pa hrefhttpsgithub.comfenriswolfpythonhadoopblobmasterpythonhadoophadoopiocompressLzoCodec.py relnofollowhttpsgithub.comfenriswolfpythonhadoopblobmasterpythonhadoophadoopiocompressLzoCodec.pyap  pwhere I replace lzo with snappy for Snappy compression, and within the pythonhadoop frame work those files can be written and read without any errors.  On Hadoop, however, I get EOF errors when I feed them as Hadoop inputp  precodeException in thread main java.io.EOFException         at org.apache.hadoop.io.compress.BlockDecompressorStream.rawReadIntBlockDecompressorStream.java126         at org.apache.hadoop.io.compress.BlockDecompressorStream.getCompressedDataBlockDecompressorStream.java98         at org.apache.hadoop.io.compress.BlockDecompressorStream.decompressBlockDecompressorStream.java82         at org.apache.hadoop.io.compress.DecompressorStream.readDecompressorStream.java76         at org.apache.hadoop.io.compress.DecompressorStream.readDecompressorStream.java64         at java.io.DataInputStream.readByteDataInputStream.java265         at org.apache.hadoop.io.WritableUtils.readVLongWritableUtils.java299         at org.apache.hadoop.io.WritableUtils.readVIntWritableUtils.java320         at org.apache.hadoop.io.SequenceFileReader.nextSequenceFile.java1911         at org.apache.hadoop.io.SequenceFileReader.nextSequenceFile.java1934         at SequenceFileReadDemo.mainSequenceFileReadDemo.java34 codepre  pI have consistently seen this particular message only when I use LZO or Snappy.  p  pMy suspicion is that LzoCodec and SnappyCodec in Hadoop arent generating or reading in the same way as Pythons implementations in lzo and snappy, but Im not sure what they should be.p  pIs there any reason why sequence files with those compression schemes are not generated properly outside the Java Hadoop framework  Again, the whole thing works fine so long I use Gzip, BZip2, or Default.p

Negative 10 pHow do you design and build your monadic stacks For the first time I need to build a monadic stack using transformers to solve a real world problem, but Im not thoroughly sure in which emorderem to stack the transformers. As you already know, as long as a computation has kind code gt code, basically anything can play the role of the inner monad in a transformer, thus a couple of questionsp  ul liShould some particular transformer be at the top of the stack e.g. ReaderT WriterTli liWhat should drive the design Intuition Types e.g. shape the stack according to your APIs needsli liIs every stack isomorphic to each other to a certain extent or is it likely that, if I build my stack incorrectly I might end up to not being able to use certain underlying monads or to have a big bloated mess of codelift . lift . liftIO [...]code My gut feeling would suggest that, if the transformers derive some instances e.g. MonadReader, MonadIO, etc, like most transformers in codemtlcode do, it shouldnt matter in which order I put the transformers.li ul  pIm interest in hearing from seasoned Haskellers about best practices or rules of thumb.p  pcodeforever  print Thankscodep  pA.p

Negative 10 pIve recently updated my PhoneGap iOS application to version 2.7.0  the update was mostly painless but my application now returns the useragent string of an iPad even when installed on an iPhone.

Negative 10 pI have the following setup there are N instances of Azure Worker Role deployed. Our desktop application uploads a message to the Azure, and then a set of images related to the message is uploaded. Message knows what images it needs. p  pThese 2 activities message upload and images upload are strongindependentstrong  images can be uploaded BEFORE message even generated by user call it caching  but its more complex, or few secondsminutes AFTER message was uploaded to Azure.p  pI store message in Azure MSSQL database, images are stored in blobs, and URLs to them are stored in database. Also there is emMessageToImageem table which stores links to images for the message. Here is a simplified DB structure pardon my Cp  precodeclass Message      public int Id     public string Text   class Image      public int Id     public string Name     public string BlobUrl    Null if image was not received by the service yet   class MessageToImage      public int MessageId     public Listltintgt ImageIds  codepre  pAnd when we have message with all images ready i.e. all images are uploaded, we need to do something else with it lets say, post to Facebook. strongHERE IS THE QUESTIONstrong how can I guarantee that message will be processed only once In the worst case scenario, I will have N instances receiving N images for the message at the same time  and which instance will choose that it should send message to the further processing And how can I guarantee that it will happen only oncep  pSo far I came up with following ideasp  ol lipMake sure that update BlobUrl for Image database logic will be atomic, and will return number of missing images for the message. This way I will trigger further processing only on one instance  the one which receives 0 as the result of database update. BUT how can I do that on MSSQL level and more complex  how can i do that using Entity Frameworkpli lipHave a dedicated worker role which job will be selecting messages which have all images  and send them for processing. But that does not scale well... and looks a bit ugly.pli ol  pAny other ideassuggestions p  pThanksp  hr  pstrongUPDATE1strong Richard and Rob suggested to use Service Bus Queue. I did look into it. The part which I still dont have an answer for is how the piece of code in WORKER ROLE which decides WHEN to send the Message to the Queue for processing should look like Message gets sent to the queue only when all images are present in the databaseblobs i.e. uploaded to the Azure cloud. And here I would still like to point to my cornercase example  I have 10 images being simultaneously processed by 10 Worker Roles. For all instances processing ends at the same time. Each role updates database with uploaded image URL. And THEN I should somehow trigger final Message processing  meaning one of the instances should get the priority. And Im not clear HOW I should do this. p  pHope this makes my question it a bit cleaner.p

Negative 10 pI have a requirement for low memory footprint while processing XML files upwards of 400500MB size. This means that I can have the file loaded inmemory only once at any point in time e.g. in a string object. The data structure is such that the elements nest in only a few levels, but are many in number i.e. many rows of data but grouped to only a couple of levels.p  pDuring processing, I need to forward some of the data directly i.e. exactly as read from the file, unicode characterforcharacter to another stream. In other parts of the file, I need to removeadd information usually in the form of attribute values and possibly forward the result in a byteconsistent way to another stream i.e. removing or adding data the same way will always produce the same result.p  pIve looked into XmlReader and XmlTextReader but they dont provide a way to get the exact text of the node that was Read.

Negative 10 pIve some periodic operation to be performed in my application, say of period codeTcode. For now, im using codeTimer.scheduleAtFixedRateTimerTask, 0, Tcode. Now I want to avoid the overlapping of the single operations in some cases a single operation could take more time than codeTcode. Ive read codeTimercode implementation use a single thread to execute operations, so there would be no overlapping in a standard situations. The problem is that in my case the single operations are not executed directly by the codeTimerTaskcode passed to codeTimercode operations are only started from it, and they are executed asynchronously.p  pSo, there could be overlapping if a codeTimerTaskcode execution starts a new operation before the previous has finished. Instead, if overlapping occurs, I want to wait the termination of previous execution and start a new operation as soon as previous completed.p  pWhat would be the best implementation to obtain this behavior Should I switch from Timer to another support Its Android environment, so I prefer a Java standard codeutil.concurrentcode or some Androidbased implementation instead of other based on Spring Quartz and other specific frameworks.p

Negative 10 pCurrently I have a site, codehttpsmysite.comcode a working codeDrupal7code site. I want to have something like this, codehttpsmysite.comdevcode in order for me to test the things first on this location before finally uploading it to the main site. What I did was copy the entire folder where all the files located and pasted it inside codedevcode. I made a duplicate of the DB being used by the main site and edited the file codesettings.phpcode under codesitesdefaultcode, edited the base url from codehttpswww.mysite.comcode to codehttpswww.mysite.comdevcode. But when I tried navigating the pages using the linksmenu, admin it gives me codePage not foundcode response. In addition, I did uncomment this line codeRewriteBase code on my code.htaccesscode file. I can also log in, but after logging in the links point to the main site like this, codehttpsmysite.comlink1code, codehttpsmysite.comlink2code and so on. What did I miss Can someone please help Thanksp

Negative 10 pI am trying to use a RegEx to search through a long string, and I am having trouble coming up with an expression.  I am trying to search through some HTML for a set of tags beginning with a tag containing a certain value and ending with a different tag containing another value.  The code I am currently using to attempt this is as followsp  precodematcher  new RegExp.lt[gt]  startText    endText  .  endText  , g  data.replacematcher, 1 codepre  pThe strangeness around the middle  codeendText.code  is borrowed from another thread, found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions406230regularexpressiontomatchstringnotcontainingawordherea, that seems to describe my problem.  The issue I am facing is that the expression matches the beginning tag, but it does not find the ending tag and instead includes the remainder of the data.  Also, the lookaround in the middle slowed the expression down a lot.  Any suggestions as to how I can get this workingp  pstrongEDITstrong  I understand that parsing HTML in RegEx isnt the best option makes me feel dirty, but Im in a timecrunch and any other alternative I can think of will take too long.  Its hard to say what exactly the markup I will be parsing will look like, as I am creating it on the fly.  The best I can do is to say that I am looking at a large table of data that is collected for a range of items on a range of dates.  Both of these ranges can vary, and I am trying to select a certain range of dates from a single row.  The approximate value of codestartTextcode and codeendTextcode are codeASSETIDltYYYYMMDDgtcode.  The idea is to find the code that corresponds to this range of cells.  This edit could quite possibly have made this even more confusing, but Im not sure how much more information I could really give without explaining the entire application.p  pstrongEDITstrong  Well, this was a stupid question.  Apparently, I just forgot to add code.code after the last paren.  Cant believe I spent so long on this  Thanks to those of you that tried to helpp

Im specifically thinking on junior programmers who wouldwill have to maintain my code in the future or what myself would have thought if I had seen this just some days ago.p  pOn the one hand implicit casting looks a bit weird. It looks like assigning different, uncompatible types. And the IDEs intellisense wont tell you theres a method that can do that without the compiler complaining.p  pON the other hand, explicit casting looks like forcing the conversion. Ok, its a way of telling the compiler I know what Im doing, dont grumble. But how would a programmer with no access to codeFoocodes code or no knowledge that casting operators exist in C that the casting can be performed and do something expectedp  pWhich of the types of casting is preferred in which situations Is there a third wayp

Negative 10 pI have two classes. The superclass is a Component class, and the subclass is a Transform class.p  pThe framework Im using has a function that returns a list of components of a certain type.  However, the list will return them as Component, since the type isnt restricted to a specific subclass however its the way Im using it. p  pSo, in the following scenario, I know that all the returned components will be of the Transform subclass. What Im doing is Im iterating over the list and then casting each component to Transform.

Negative 10 pIm using a program that generates reports automatically using Word templates.  In other words, I cant modify the code that preprocesses the text before read by the template.p  pThat said, there are text entries that have a trailing newline and some that dont.  I would like to remove the trailing newline if one exists.p  pExample  MERGEFIELD dbEntry p  pdbEntry might have a trailing newline.  If it does, Id like to remove it when displaying in the generated document using template code.p  pIs this possible  If not, are there any hacks in MS Word that I can do to make it so it looks like there is no newlinep

I need to convert this base 2 string into base 10 and store that number into long ten. Right now whenever I call this method, I always get the same number depending on the length of the string. If the string is 2 letters long, it will always return a 1, if its 3 letters long, it will always return a 3, if its 4 letters long, it will always return a 7 and so on. Help would be very much appreciated.p

Negative 10 pAfter reading the question and its answer from the followingbr a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12733084cudawhyiswarpbasedparallelreductionslowerLINKap  pI still have a question remaining in my mind. From my background in CC I understand that using codevolatilecode has its demerits. And also it is pointed in the answers that in case of CUDA, the optimizations can replace shared array with registers to keep data if codevolatilecode keyword is not used.p  pI want to know what would be the performance issues that can be encountered when calculating sum reduction. e.g.p  precodedevice void sumvolatile int sdata, int tid      if tid lt 16              sdata[tid]  sdata[tid  16]         sdata[tid]  sdata[tid   8]         sdata[tid]  sdata[tid   4]         sdata[tid]  sdata[tid   2]         sdata[tid]  sdata[tid   1]       codepre  pI am using in warp reduction. Since all the threads with in warp are in sync, therefore I believe there is no need to use codesyncthreadscode construct. p  pI want to know will removing the keyword codevolatilecode mess up my sum due to cuda optimizations Can I use reduction such as this without codevolatilecode keyword.p  pSince I use this reduction function multiple time, will codevolatilecode keyword cause any performance degradationp

Negative 10 pIm wondering if theres a nice way to refer to types of values without explicitly aliasing them using codetypecode in code not at runtime  there is no reification going on here.p  pTake the following code using a hrefhttphackage.haskell.orgpackagevinyl0.2Data.Vinylap  precode LANGUAGE DataKinds, TypeOperators   import Data.Vinyl  name  Field  name  String age  Field  age  Int type Person  [name  String, age  Int] codepre  pHere we have the types codename  Stringcode and codeage  Intcode repeated in two places. If we reuse fields in multiple records, this can become multiple places. Despite the fact that the codePersoncode type is really emreferringem to the constituent fields, the type declarations are independent. So changing codeagecode to be represented by codeFloatcode, say, requires changes in various places.p  pObviously its not necessary to explicitly type things, since they will be inferred. However, in my case the record types are being returned from an options parser, and thus exported. Likewise, one could write the followingp  precodetype Name  name  String name  Field  Name type Age  age  Int age  Field  Age type Person  [Name, Age] codepre  pHowever, this then involves another load of type aliases and double the number of lines. What I would emlikeem to be able to write is the followingp  precodename  Field  name  String age  Field  age  Int type Person  [typeof name, typeof age] codepre  pThis explicitly links the type of a codePersoncode to the types of its fields.p  pIs there a way preferably sansTH, but Id be interested even involving TH to do this p

Is there a clean way to do thisp

Negative 10 pIm trying to use a Bootstrap 3 popover as a relatively positioned element that is inserted in normal document flow, so it pushes down the subsequent DOM elements. That is, I have a big image at the top, followed by a form. When the image is clicked, I want a popover to appear below the image, pushing down the form. p  pI understand that popovers generally have an absolute position as in the normal use case this makes sense. However, in my particular case, Id like it to be relatively positioned, but still appear below the element it belongs to. Is there a nonhacky way to accomplish this p

Negative 10 pi was thinking about the implementation in CC of Boruvka MST Algorithm. this algorithm creates N set of vertices and for each of them chooses the edge with minimal cost. I was thinking to code in this way I have a structure for each vertex with vertex tag and all its edges. So I proceed with analyze the first vertex and I choose its minimal edge then I add to the result the vertex and the destination vertex. and so I proceed with others iteration for all the vertex. But in this way I have to make a sort for all the edges for each vertex, that seem to be computation prohibitivep  pplease let me know if my reasoning are right, and help me to find out a solution, thank youp
Negative 10 pI am using Access 2007 and I have a table with a column of dates in the standard MMDDYYYY format, and a column of as currency. I am working with test data and the records span from 1900 to 2175, with one record for each year, with costs ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars.p  pI have a report that uses this query as its RecordSourcep  precodeSELECT YearAppliances.DateReplace AS Years, Appliances.CostReplace AS Costs FROM Appliances codepre  pUsing the ribbon tool, I have set the Group amp Sort to Group on Years, from oldest to newest, [custom] by every 15, with costs totaled, with a header section, with a footer section, and keep whole group together on one page.p  pHere is a a hrefhttpi.imgur.comGc2jCBB.png relnofollowscreenshot of the Group amp Sorta and Here is a a hrefhttpi.imgur.comP8w5iOu.png relnofollowscreenshot of the first resultsa.p  pAs you can see, the first group contains only 5 records where it should contain 15, and none of the records are in order. The last group not shown contains only one record, while the next 18 groups contain the proper 15 results, with the last group containing 1 result.p  pAdding a secondary Group amp Sort that only chooses to Sort by Year will sort the records properly, but it does not fix the number of records shown in the first group.p  pIn the interest of discovering a pattern, I made a list showing the number of records in the first group when I select different intervals for the grouping. The numbers are the interval, followed by the number of records in the first group.p  pre 11,    62,    113,   164,   2111, 22,    74,    128,   174,   2214, 32,    84,    1311,  188,   239, 44,    98,    144,   1918,  2420, 55,    1010,  155,   2020,  2525 pre  pThe intervals that are multiples of 5 all showed the correct results except for 15, and if theres a pattern to the other ones I am not seeing it except for a lot of 4s.p  h1 Update h1  pAfter playing around with this I have discovered that the interval is causing the starting year to change. For example, choosing an interval of 15 causes the report to start counting from 1890, which gives me only 5 records in the first group because my data starts at 1900. I have not seen discovered any pattern in how the starting year relates to the interval that I choose.p

Here are the stylings for the banner and the imagep  precodemonthlyfeaturebanner      width 100  monthlyfeaturebanner img  display block margin 0 auto  codepre  pOddly, though, in both Chrome and FF the image margins are not equal.p  pQuestion  Why is this happening Question  What can I do to fix itp  pEDIT  The answer below suggesting codetextalign centercode had the same issue as codemargin 0 autocode It should work, but it doesnt.  Also, the boxsizing fix helps if I remove it from the entire page, but it has side effects that make it impractical. A comment below from Alohi correctly pointed out that adding codeclear leftcode to the containing div along with the codemargin 0 autocode has the desired effect.  I will accept the first answer that contains that information.p

Negative 10 pBackground  Ive been using the KLite codec pack for installing video and audio codecs required for playing media files in Windows via a silentunattended installation which all works fine.p  pI am interested in figuring out how silent installs of KLite behave when previous installs of KLite already exist.  Is it the case that silentunattended installs of new versions can be reliably run on top of old ones  Is it possible to do a silent uninstall as wellp  pAlternatively would some kind of command line tool exist GSpot which can detect the presence of codecs that have been already installed, or if there is a way of doing this programmatically in Cp  pI would be keen to hear from those with experience of this.p

Negative 10 pI am try to make my VBA program not so fussy by adding some robust error handling. I know that typical error handling in VBA goes something like thisp  precodeSub doSomething On Error GoTo errorHandler  Regular code here   Exit sub   errorHandler Lots of code to do something about it  End Sub codepre  pThe problem is that my program has what feels like a million methods and to add the errorHandler code to every single method when MANY of the errors will be the same for several methods feels like a waste of time and keystrokes. Is there any way to make a error handling method instead of having lots of code in each method under the errorHandlerp  pIn my code naive mind it seems like I could do something like thisp  precodeSub doSomething On Error GoTo errorHandler  Regular code here  Exit sub   errorHandler Call the method that really handles the errors End Sub codepre  porp  precodeSub doSomething On Error GoTo method that handles all errors  Regular code here  End Sub codepre  pI am pretty new to VBA and definitely new to correctly handling errors in VBA. Any help or direction would be fabulous. Thanks for your helpp

Negative 10 pWhile debugging some of my code written in C I had to walk through disassembly to get a clearer understanding of what is going on on a microlevel. Most of the code is rather transparent, but there are some functions obviously provided by CLR or C, because I didnt implement them, which lie in 0xffff address space and are unknown to me. For instance in codeBitmap.Widthcode there is a call for FFFF0630p  precode00000000  push        ebp  00000001  mov         ebp,esp  00000003  push        eax  00000004  xor         eax,eax  00000006  mov         dword ptr [ebp4],eax  00000009  mov         eax,dword ptr [ecx10h]  0000000c  mov         edx,ecx  0000000e  push        eax  0000000f  push        edx  00000010  lea         ecx,[ebp4]  00000013  call        FFFF0630  codepre  pI cant step into it with a debugger, so I can only presume from the context, it should be for some kind of memory validation. But I am not sure, as even this functions tween codeBitmap.Heightcode has another address FFFF060C at the same spot. There is not much sense in different validation for two almost equivalent properties.p  pSo, what are these functions indeed What do they dop

Negative 10 pIm at the very beginning stages of learning rails using heroku as deployment tool. I ran into a bit of problem today, which is now fixed, but I was wondering if theres a properbetter way to do what I did. p  pMy problem was as follows I wrote a migration file that created a table with some indices using addindex. The code would look like thisp  precodeclass DeviseCreateUsers lt ActiveRecordMigration   def change     createtableusers do t       t.string username       ...     end     addindex users, username,     unique gt true   end     def self.down     droptableusers     removeindex users, username   end  end codepre  pcodeheroku run rake dbmigratecode ran fine but codeheroku run rake dbrollbackcode failed sbecause I assume coderemoveindexcode was trying to delete an index from a column that had already been erased.p  pSo I then added a codeself.downcode method to my migration file removing the indices before dropping the table. Afterwards, codeheroku run rake dbmigratecode didnt do anything, and codeheroku run rake dbrollbackcode is stuck at the same error as before. Resetting the database or dropping the table didnt work either. I ended up removing the codeaddindexcode lines in my migration before the rollback finally workss.p  p... and unfortunately I no longer have any idea why codedbrollbackcode failed. The error message was codeindexusersonusername on table users does not existcode, so my guess is that I did something stupid like modifying the database or modified the migration file before doing a rollback. Or could it be because I am mixing change and down method in the same migration filep  pAnyway, my main question is, if a codedbrollbackcode fails, what thenp  pSome options in my headp  ol liFix the migration file until the rollback worksli liFix the database manually until the rollback worksli liFix the database manually and ignore the migration completely dunno how to do this thisli lili ol

So I expect 2 as result of codelencode. However, it prints 1. The reason why is it takes all result of find as one elements. How can I fix this Thanks.p  pP.S I found several solutions in StackOverFlow about similar problem. However, it is little bit different so I can apply to mine. I need to store result to variable before loop. Thanks again.p

Negative 10 pHow can I create a regex for Vim that accommodates for matching multiple double quotes strings on one line, without matching the text in between the two double quotes strings A restriction on the pattern is that the double quoted strings cant contain a single quote.

I cant rely on white space surrounding the strings, as you see in the third line. And of course it needs to work with the fourth line as well.p  ul licat is called fooli licats name is fooli lixcats foodli lix  catli ul

The client can pick one of a few hundred different pieces of named metadata.

Because if this when rendering the form we need to know, in advance, what variable names we need to pass for this clients template.p  pWe had thought of having a consistent dictionary with all possible values and passing that in each time but it was unworkable as new available fields are added frequently to the underlying pool of available metadata the client could pick.p  pBecause of this we had hoped to use Mako to template the config files but I cant figure out how to determine with the field values in the template would be so that I can build a fullformed Context to pass to the template.p
Negative 10 pI read some related post concerning the same problem but i did have concerns. In fact,jmeter reponse time is the time  maked by the server to send and analyse reponse and the browser page load time is client side. Added to that JMeter send request in sequence and the browser send many at the same time it depends from browser to another. Even that requests are sending in the same time normally the response time will be very close for the two case. Im attending to find response time for manual tests with browser more important than JMeter but unfortuanately there is a huge diffrence even 3 minutes  that make me wonder the cause.p
Negative 10 pFirst of all, I have looked at loads of related questions, both on SO and in other places  but none is addressing my issue unfortunately.p  pI have a dynamically built DOM substree about 10levels deep and a complex javascript code that shows or hides pieces of that subtree or the entire subtree.  Theres another code that can change text of various codedivcode elements somewhere inside that subtree somewhere means anywhere from level 1 to level 10.  Further, individual nodes inside the subtree can also be shown or hidden.p  pTo make a long story short, whenever the text is changed, I need to figure out the new height of the corresponding div.  Unfortunately, when the text changes, the actual div is visible within the context of its parent and usually its parents parent  but not within the context of the whole subtree  hence the height is returned as 0.p  pPretty much all solutions center around making the div visible, measuring its height, then hiding it again.  To adopt this solution to my issue, I would have to take the div in question, then traverse the dom tree upward from it, check whether the corresponding parents are hidden or not, change their visibility, continue upward until I got everything shown, then measure the height of my div, then revert the visibility of the elements that I changed.p  pApart from being a nightmare to implement, it sounds EXTREMELY slow.  So, is there any solution for getting the height of a div, that in itself is visible within its parent, but has several of its not direct parents hidden  Im happy with either jQuery or a plain javascript solution.p

Negative 10 pI am not sure if amazon simply does not offer graphics for linux vm instances or if its to do with configuration. But i recently setup a linux node on ec2 and i tried to setup rdp. I kept getting a blank screen but after much trial and error, went with bizspark and setup a linux node and to my surprise I see the bizspark linux node comes with a vga graphics card while the amazon one does not p  pWithout a vga graphics card or builtin chipset its not possible to rdp in the linux node.  So does amazon offer graphics card on linux vms or is it a simply a matter of configuration  p  pedit  It is possible to have rdp even without a graphic card apparently. What I found out is one can install X2GO server on their ubuntu server and then just get the x2go client. No need for rdp.p

Negative 10 pIn our build system, we generate multiple .so files foo.so, bar.so, ... that are loaded during runtime by the main executable biz. So the .so files are linked separately.p  pWe also have our own util.a static library, that has some utility functions and global data.p  pThe problem comes when some of the .so want to use util.a datafunction, but we cant link each .so to util.a. Its because of the data section global data must be unique in the program address space. If more than one .so is linked to util.a and has a copy of the data, the program behavior will be very surprising but hard to debug.p  pWe cant link executable biz to util.a either.

Negative 10 pI have some data two HashSets and a timestamp Instant that Id like all requests to my JIRA OpenSocial gadgetplugin to share  because it takes a long time to generate couple of minutes and because the sharing will help the requests be more performant. p  pOccasionally very rarely, a request might include a parameter that indicates this shared data should be refreshed. And of course the first time its needed, it gets populated. It is okay for the data to represent a stale answer  it is based on things that change slowly and used to visualize trends so offbyone errors are tolerable.p  pI imagine when JIRA starts up or I upload a new version of my addon and multiple requests come in during the first couple of minutes, Id need to handle the population of this expensive shared data in a threadsafe way. Currently the results look fine but as I understand it, thats been just due to chance.p  pOnly one thread needs to do the work of populating. On startup, the other threads will have to wait of course because they cant skip ahead emptyhanded. If all threads do the expensive initialization, thats a lot of unnecessary load on the serverp  pBut after the initial cost, if multiple concurrent requests come in and one of them includes the refresh parameter, only that one thread needs to pay the price  Im fine with the other threads using an old copy of the expensive data and thereby staying performant, and including in the response that yes emsomeoneem out there is refreshing the data but heres a result using an old copy.p  pMore about the data The two HashSets and the timestamp are intended to represent a consistent snapshot in time. The HashSet contents depend on values in the database only, and the timestamp is just the time of the most recent refresh. None of this data depends on any earlier snapshot in time. And none of it depends on program state either.  The timestamp is only used to answer the question how old is this data in a rough sense. Every time the data is refreshed, Id expect the timestamp to be more recent but nothing is going to break if its wrong. Its just for debugging and transparency. Since a snapshot doesnt depend on earlier snapshots or the program state, it could be wrapped and marked as volatile.p  pIs there an obvious choice for the best way to go about this Pros and cons of alternativesp

Negative 10 pI have a Win Forms app in which I am starting a process from a different .exe file, then setting its Handle property to a panel in my Win Form app. This gives the effect of the other app running inside of the Win Forms app.p  pHere is how I accomplish thatp  precode[DllImportuser32.dll, SetLastError  true] static extern IntPtr SetParentIntPtr hwc, IntPtr hwp  string exepath  myProgram.exe ProcessStartInfo p  new ProcessStartInfoexepath process  Process.Startp Thread.Sleep500  sleep to allow program to start up properly         SetParentprocess.MainWindowHandle, pictureBox1.Handle then set the handle to give the effect of being run inside the win forms app codepre  pNow I know I can call process.Kill in a FormClosed event, which terminates the process when this form is closed, but how would I go about killing the process if my Win Form app is forcefully quit Is that even possible p  pBecause the processs handle is set to a panel in the Win Form app, it doesnt appear on the taskbar but it will still continue to run if process.Kill is not called, which happens when the Win Form is forcefully closed.

I tested the code but not found any solution but still i am thinking that it causes because of codeweb.cofigcode file because in that file we have mentioned membership provider.  p  pHere is how my Membership Provider is configuredp  precodeltmembership defaultProviderCustomizedProvidergt   ltprovidersgt     ltcleargt     ltadd nameCustomizedProvider          applicationNameBSchool          typeSystem.Web.Security.SqlMembershipProvider          minRequiredPasswordLength5           connectionStringNameSchoolConnectionString           enablePasswordRetrievalfalse           enablePasswordResettrue           requiresQuestionAndAnswerfalse           passwordFormatHashed           minRequiredNonalphanumericCharacters1          gt   ltprovidersgt ltmembershipgt codepre  pAnd here is how my Profile Provider is configuredp  precodeltprofile gt   ltprovidersgt     ltcleargt     ltadd nameAspNetSqlProfileProvider          connectionStringNameSchoolConnectionString          applicationNameLCI          typeSystem.Web.Profile.SqlProfileProvider, System.Web, Version2.0.0.0, Cultureneutral, PublicKeyTokenb03f5f7f11d50a3a          gt   ltprovidersgt   ltpropertiesgt     ltadd nameId                 typeSystem.Int64 providerAspNetSqlProfileProvider allowAnonymoustrue defaultValue0gt     ltadd nameLanguageIds       typeSystem.String providerAspNetSqlProfileProvider allowAnonymoustrue defaultValuegt     ltadd nameQualificationIds  typeSystem.String providerAspNetSqlProfileProvider allowAnonymoustrue defaultValuegt     ltadd nameCountryId         typeSystem.Int64 providerAspNetSqlProfileProvider allowAnonymoustrue defaultValue0gt     ltadd nameCityId            typeSystem.Int64 providerAspNetSqlProfileProvider allowAnonymoustrue defaultValue0gt     ltadd namePriceId           typeSystem.Int64 providerAspNetSqlProfileProvider allowAnonymoustrue defaultValue0gt     ltadd nameGenderIds         typeSystem.String providerAspNetSqlProfileProvider allowAnonymoustrue defaultValuegt     ltadd nameStudentAgeIds     typeSystem.String providerAspNetSqlProfileProvider allowAnonymoustrue defaultValuegt     ltadd nameReligionIds       typeSystem.String providerAspNetSqlProfileProvider allowAnonymoustrue defaultValuegt     ltadd nameFacilityIds       typeSystem.String providerAspNetSqlProfileProvider allowAnonymoustrue defaultValuegt     ltadd nameSearchString      typeSystem.String providerAspNetSqlProfileProvider allowAnonymoustrue defaultValuegt     ltadd nameCompareSchoolIds typeSystem.String providerAspNetSqlProfileProvider allowAnonymoustrue defaultValuegt     ltadd nameCompareArray      typeSystem.Collections.ArrayList providerAspNetSqlProfileProvider allowAnonymoustruegt     ltadd nameTitleString       typeSystem.String providerAspNetSqlProfileProvider allowAnonymoustrue defaultValuegt   ltpropertiesgt ltprofilegt codepre  pPlease tell me friends how to solve these kind of problem.p  pI want to know that why it hits codeaspnetProfilecode and codeaspnetUserscode table on every call.p

Negative 10 pI am using the codenpmcode modules a hrefhttpsgithub.comjsoversongruntenv relnofollowgrunt enva and a hrefhttpswww.npmjs.orgpackageloadgruntconfig relnofollowloadgruntconfiga in my project. codegrunt envcode handles environment variables for you, while codeloadgruntconfigcode handles, well, loads the codegruntcode configuration for you. You can put your tasks into other files, then codeloadgruntconfigcode will bundle them up and have codegruntcode load amp consume them for you. You can also make an codealiases.jscode file, with tasks you want to combine together into one task, running one after another. Its similar to the a hrefhttpgruntjs.comapigrunt.task relnofollowgrunt.registerTaska task in the original codeGruntfile.jscode. I put all my codegruntcode tasks inside a separate codegruntcode folder under the root folder with the main codeGruntfilecode, with no extra subfolders, as suggested by the codeloadgruntconfigcode README.md on Github.

Notice that the server is started on port 3000, meaning that during execution of the codegrunt expressprodcode task, codeSERVERPORTcode is not set so the port gets set to 3000. There are numerous other examples like this, where an environment variable is not set so my app uses the default. However, notice that codesessioncode tries to connect to the database on port 27018 and fails, so codeMONGOPORTcode does get set eventually.p  pIf I had just tried the codegrunt servercode task, I could chalk it up to codeloadgruntconfigcode running the tasks in parallel instead of one after the other or some other error, but even when I try the tasks onebyone, such as running codegrunt envprod shellmongod expressserverprod expresskeepalivecode, I get similar incorrect results, so either codegruntcode or codegrunt envcode run the tasks in parallel, as well, or something else is going on.p  pWhats going on here Why are the environment variables not set correctly for later codegruntcode tasks When are they eventually set, and why then rather than some other time How can I make them get set for codegruntcode tasks themselves rather than after, assuming there even is a wayp

Negative 10 pI need to create a horizontal list view for a Windows Store application with full screen image items, something like the Gallery control for Android. To do this, Ive used a codeGridViewcode and changed the codeItemsPanelcode template to be a codeVirtualizingStackPanelcode with horizontal orientation. The problem is that I cannot make the Image items to be full screen. What Ive tried is to make the codeGridView.ItemContainerStylecode to bind to the codeGridViewcodes width, like thisp  precodeBinding widthBinding  new Binding  SourceiconsHolder, Path  new PropertyPathWidth, Converter  new TestItemWidthConverter  Style itemStyle   new Style itemStyle.TargetType  typeofGridViewItem itemStyle.Setters.Addnew SetterGridViewItem.WidthProperty, widthBinding 800  iconsHolder.ItemContainerStyle  itemStyle codepre  pWhen I replace the codewidthBindingcode with 800, for example, the icons have the specified width, but when I use the binding, no items are visible, so the codeStylecode do its job, but the codeBindingcode has a problem. In order to debug this, Ive created a fake converter, so I can see if the binding works, but the Convert.. method isnt called at all.p  pMy GridView is created like thisp  precodeGridView iconsHolder  new GridView iconsHolder.ItemsPanel  App.Current.Resources[HorizontalVSPTemplate] as ItemsPanelTemplate iconsHolder.ItemTemplate  App.Current.Resources[MyDataTemplate] as DataTemplate iconsHolder.Width  Window.Current.Bounds.Width iconsHolder.Height  Window.Current.Bounds.Height codepre  pand my resources are defined likep  precodeltItemsPanelTemplate xKeyHorizontalVSPTemplategt    ltVirtualizingStackPanel OrientationHorizontalgt ltItemsPanelTemplategt ltDataTemplate xKeyMyDataTemplategt    ltImage Sourcesome irrelevant url heregt ltDataTemplategt codepre  pMy converter looks like thisp  precodepublic sealed class TestItemWidthConverter  IValueConverter     public object Convertobject value, Type targetType, object parameter, string language           Debug.WriteLine binding width  value       return value         public object ConvertBackobject value, Type targetType, object parameter, string language     return value   codepre  pI dont know how to achieve this Ive also tried using codeRelativeBindingcode or make Icons to be horizontally stretched, without success or what Im doing wrong, so please help Thank you for your timep

Now, when the other projects Project1 etc do their build it cannot find the Common Assemblies, as not only are they removed, but the paths are different from what it expects them to be in casrcCommonBinaries instead of casrcBinaries.p  pIs there anyway to tell the build server to not delete those files in the Binaries directory and to specify the folder location to checkout to Or how one one go about solving such a problemp  pThanks very muchp

Negative 10 pI have a very simple problem. I am learning Java, and was given an assignment to draw a car. I did this all in one class that extends codeJPanelcode, and did the drawing within codepaintComponentcode.p  pI realize this is poor objectoriented programming, and decided to try to subclass some of the parts to rectify this situation.p  pI tried to create a class that draws wheels, but was unsuccessful.p  pEssentially, I wanted to be able to do thisp  precodeMain Class extends JPanel  paintComponent        Wheel leftWheel  new Wheel0, 50, 100        this.addleftWheel  codepre  pThis should draw a wheel at the point 0, 50 within the codeJPanelcode, and have a diameter of 100.p  pHowever, im unsure how im supposed to control the positioning in the codeJPanelcode. When I do this, the wheel in drawn at the top center of my window. This is what my wheel class looks likep  precodepublic class Wheel extends JComponent   private int x, y, diameter private boolean clockwise  Wheelint x, int y, int size, boolean cw      this.setPreferredSizenew Dimensionsize, size     this.x  x     this.y  y     diameter  size     clockwise  cw     repaint   public void paintComponentGraphics canvas      super.paintComponentcanvas     canvas.setColorColor.gray     canvas.fillOvalx,y,diameter,diameter    codepre  pThe x and y should be where it appears on the parent window, however, this is not the case in the following code located in the parent class that extends JFrame p  precodeWheel leftWheel  new Wheel0,0,WHEELDIAMETER,true this.addleftWheel codepre  pThe wheel doesnt draw at the top left of my window, it draws in the center of my window at the top. Am I doing something incorrectly  Sorry if I dont follow some Java conventions, I dont have any experience yet. Is this how I should be handling the drawing of the wheel, or is there a more accepted practice for doing this type of drawingp  pFor example, in my codeJPanelcode class, if I add the following codep  precodeWheel x  new Wheel50,60,75,true this.addx codepre  pI get a frame sized 75x75 in which a wheel sized 75x75 is drawn at the point 50,60 within emthatem frame, not within the parent codeJPanelcodes coordinate system. The result is a circle that gets clipped and I only see the top left of the circle. That image is displayed at the top center of my codeJPanelcodep  pI understand how to draw the wheel, and move it within itself, but how do I position the wheel on the codeJPanelcodep

Negative 10 pIm desperately seeking an approach to bridge the gap between the Java classes generated by wsimport as a SOAP Webservice client and JavaFXs properties.p  pMy application should have a Java EE server which contains all the business logic, security and persistence stuff. The views should be created using JavaFX 8. Communication between the Java EE server and the JavaFX client should be via SOAP.p  pSince wsimport will autogenerate the stubs for the SOAP Webservice on the clientside I need some glue to bind these stubs to my Java FX views.p  pOne approach would be to copy the field values from the objects received from the Webservice to viewmodel classes with Java FX properties, bind them to the UI widgets and when the save action is triggered copy them back in the other direction and send the object to the Webservice. But Id prefer to avoid this two manual and errorprone copying steps.p  pIs there any standard approach to solve this problemp

Negative 10 pI was going through a sample quiz and seem to have a hard time understanding 1 particular question. p  ol start5 liThe Fibonacci sequence 1,1,2,3, ... can be generated iteratively by starting with the first two 0th and 1st and generating every subsequent one by adding the previous two. Thus, if we start with the first two, the nth Fibonacci number, for n  2, can be generated by n  1 additions. In particular, we need 6 additions to generate the 7th Fibonacci number. However, a recursive program to generate the 7th Fibonacci number needsli ol  pa 20 additions c 5 additions b 13 additions d 18 additionsp  pAnswer a 20 additionsp  pI dont quite understand how they got 20 additions.

Negative 10 pI have an old implementation of PayFlow LINK using Classic ASP and hosted pages.  My data is passed in name value pairs as hidden fields on a form.  I need to implement the Secure Token process.  The only example I can find uses CURL in an Iframe  not very helpful to me.p  pMy understanding is that once a user clicks submit, I could pass the data name, addr, amount, etc.. along with a SecureTokenId that I create, to Payflow.  In return I would receive a SecureTokenId.  I would then do a 2nd call that sends my account along with the SecureTokenId and that Payflow would use the secureTokenId to retrieve the detail name, addr, amount, etc. Hopefully thats a correct interpretation.p  pAny helpexamples  especially in Payflow LINK and Classic ASP would be greatly appreciated.p  pThanks, Bobp

This can occur for certain types of temporary interruptions such as an incoming phone call or SMS message or when the user quits the application and it begins the transition to the background state.      Use this method to pause ongoing tasks, disable timers, and throttle down OpenGL ES frame rates. Games should use this method to pause the game.    voidapplicationDidEnterBackgroundUIApplication application           Use this method to release shared resources, save user data, invalidate timers, and store enough application state information to restore your application to its current state in case it is terminated later.      If your application supports background execution, this method is called instead of applicationWillTerminate when the user quits.    voidapplicationWillEnterForegroundUIApplication application          Called as part of the transition from the background to the inactive state here you can undo many of the changes made on entering the background.    voidapplicationDidBecomeActiveUIApplication application           Restart any tasks that were paused or not yet started while the application was inactive.

Typical reasons for an error here include           The persistent store is not accessible           The schema for the persistent store is incompatible with current managed object model.          Check the error message to determine what the actual problem was.            If the persistent store is not accessible, there is typically something wrong with the file path. Often, a file URL is pointing into the applications resources directory instead of a writeable directory.           If you encounter schema incompatibility errors during development, you can reduce their frequency by           Simply deleting the existing store          [[NSFileManager defaultManager] removeItemAtURLstoreURL errornil]            Performing automatic lightweight migration by passing the following dictionary as the options parameter          NSMigratePersistentStoresAutomaticallyOptionYES, NSInferMappingModelAutomaticallyOptionYES           Lightweight migration will only work for a limited set of schema changes consult Core Data Model Versioning and Data Migration Programming Guide for details.

Negative 10 pThere are many related questions but apparently no answers. SO...p  pMy iOS app emdoesem get updates from my BLE device while the app is in background. If I lose touch with the BLE device, then in codecentralManagerdidDisconnectPeripheralcode I call code[CBCentralManager cancelPeripheralConnection]code  otherwise I will never reconnect to the lost peripheral. Then I call [recall code[CBCentralManager scanForPeripheralsWithServicesoptions]code. p  pLogging shows me that the codedidDisconnectPeripheralcode call, and its contained calls, are both happening emwhile in backgroundem. However, the reconnect only happens when the app wakes up from background.p  pSo I am able to communicate with the connected BLE device while in background yay but not to reconnect. This is quite important to my app, and one would think to other apps. Suggestions welcome.p

Negative 10 pI have developed Stored Procedures in Oracle 11g and need to access them through Crystal Reports 14.0.2.364. When I developed the reports, I used a direct Oracle server connection server address, usernamepassword, SID, port, etc. and the report worked perfectly. As a limit on our LMS, were told that we must use ODBC connections instead of a direct Oracle Server connection, but, when I connect the Crystal Report to the Stored Procedure in this manner, I get a persistent codeError 42000[Oracle][ODBC] Syntax Error or Access Violationcode error.p  pWe have doublechecked the drivers and were up to date.

Negative 10 pShort versionp  pHow do I make init.d scripts run after cloudinit has run the codeuserdatacode script on an EC2p  pLong versionp  pOur deployment process is to construct AMIs with everything installed on them tomcat, nginx, application etc, but with certain configuration values missed out.  At boot time, the userdata script adds in the missing configuration values, and then the application stack can start upp  pOur current EC2s are based on an old version of the official Debian AMIs, which have the script codeec2runuserdatacode.  This script runs at boot, and downloads and runs the EC2s userdata.  When constructing the AMI, I simple edit the init.d scripts for tomcat, nginx etc to include ec2runuserdata in their RequiredStart line, so they start up after the userdata has been run.p  pUnfortunately that approach is no longer viable, as we want to start using the hvm base AMIs, which have cloudinit installed rather than ec2runuserdata.  But I cant figure out how cloudinit works well enough to work out how to make the process work.p  pAs far as I can tell, the userdata script is run by the cloudfinal step, but cloudfinal has all in its RequiredStart line.  I could remove it, but I dont know what consequences that might have.p  pIve tried making tomcat etc run after cloudinit or cloudconfig, but the userdata hasnt run by then.  Also, it looks like cloudinit and cloudconfig start processes then exit, which might explain why cloudfinal needs to have all in RequiredStart p  pMore Infop  ol liWe use the baked AMI approach, where we create an AMI with all the packagesapplications installed, then tell the existing Autoscaling Groups to replace their EC2s with new ones based on the new AMI via CloudFormation.  Some configuration information isnt known at baking time, but must be inserted via the userdata script.li liWhen our tomcat app starts up it expects to read in the file etcappnameapplication.conf.  That file has the text codeltltREPLACETHISgtgtcode in it.  Tomcat will fail to start up if it tries to run before codeltltREPLACETIMEgtgtcode has been replacedli liThe userdata script is something like brcodebinbash sed i sltltREPLACETIMEgtgtNew value to use, determined at deploy time etcappnameapplication.confcodeli liThe default RequiredStart for tomcat is localfs remotefs network.  At baking time, I change that to localfs remotefs network ec2runuserdatali ol  pBy doing all that, the text in etcappnameapplication.conf gets replaced before tomcat runs.  But as I said above, I want to change to using cloudinit, and I cant figure out what I need to do to make tomcat start after cloudinit has run the userdata.  I get the impression that cloudinit doesnt run the userdata until very late in the process.  I could change the userdata script to contain etcinit.dtomcat restart at the end, but it seems a bit dumb to have tomcat fail to start then get restarted.p

Negative 10 pI am using my own shader that does quite advanced calculations and outputs results into frame buffer. p  pI do call glfinish to make sure previous opengl commands are executed on the graphics card. Then i call gldrawarrays and  this single call takes 5 secondsp  pAfter calling gldrawarrays a few more times they finally start running under 1 ms per each call. So only a few first gldrawarrays calls are super slow. p  pThere is no correlation with the size of the textures used, that doesnt affect performance. If i simplify the shader source code it does make the first gldrawarrays calls faster but not dramatically. Sometimes very much benign changes in the shader source code lead to serious changes in performancee.g. commenting out a few additions or subtractions. But all these code changes can speedup first gldrawarrays calls from 5 seconds to e.g. 1 second, not more. Those changes do not affect much performance of gldrawarrays calls after first few calls are made.Those still run 1ms each, thousand times faster than first 23 calls.p  pI am buffled by this problem.

The scenario is I have the main method, public static void main, acting as a menu systemThe user simply inputs the choice that he wants. Then there are other methods that asks information like how fast is your computer, how much ram does your computer, or even if you would like to remove a computer from your inventory system.

Negative 10 pIn order to make my webapp more usable, I wanted to use some king of stepbystep user guide within the application, so the user knows what, when and where to click to achieve its aims.p  pSo, after a lot of researching, I came up with a hrefhttperagonj.github.ioTrip.js relnofollowtrip.jsa, which is stylable and pretty much customizable.p  pBUT When trying to do some of my steps, I missed two functions codeonFinishStepcode and codeonStartStepcode.p  pYes, you have an event, called codeonTripChangecode and, here, taking into account the codeindexcode of the step, you can do some actions. But, what if I want to make an action just after a step ends It wouldnt be executed until next step starts, and that would be too late.p  pI dont know if there is any hidden functionality or not so hidden that I may missed, but Ive read the a hrefhttperagonj.github.ioTrip.jsdocTrip.html relnofollowDocsa and there seems not to be any. Also, looking through the code I cannot find any calls executed this way.p  pSo, what Im asking for is how to make it to achieve this two functions, one executed right when the step starts and one executed just when it has ended.p

Negative 10 pMy question is pretty straight forward, so Im going to attempt asking it without making any dummy tables.p  pConsider the case where I have two tables A and B.  p  pSuppose that A has codevarcharcode column codeAVarcode such that every element in codeAVarcode is a string of integers which do not begin with code0code.  p  pAlso suppose that B has a codevarcharcode column codeBVarcode such that the elements of codeBVarcode are identical to the entries in codeAVarcode, but have either 1 or 2 leading code0codes in front of each entry.  p  pFor example 123454 in AVar would have a corresponding 0123454 or 00123454 in BVarp  pWhen I perform the following query I find that my join runs successfully, even though the codevarcharcode elements within the two tables are technically not the same string values.p  pWhat is happening under the hood that allows this comparison to be relaxedp  precodeSELECT      A.AVar, B.BVar FROM      A  LEFT JOIN      B ON A.AVar  B.BVar codepre

Negative 10 pI have a 3rd party library with a parser that expects a callback class with a codenewtokencode method.

Any code examples would be appreciated.p

Negative 10 pI stumbled on this really weird behavior while doing some micro benchmarks of various common operations like boxing, casting, object allocation, etc, in order to better learn how to implement a data structure library Ive been working on.p  pBasically, having a static constructor even if it is empty in a generic class causes any method call to be drastically slower, but only if the type parameter is of a specific kind probably a reference type. This also applies to any lambdas defined in the body. Lambdas do eventually get translated to methods in nested classes, so I guess nested classes are affected as well . Strangely, having a complicated eminitializerem has no impact. p  pThe performance impact is much higher than a normal eminterfaceem method call, and is around as large as a virtual generic method call this from other research.p  pWhat is the reason for this This is the first time Ive been genuinely stumped by how .NET behaves. I was under the impression that a static constructor runs once, and has little effect otherwise.p  pThe code appears below.

Negative 10 pI have encountered a problem while writing tests for my activity which made me wonder about this issue. Im using ActivityInstrumentationTestCase2 and my activity sends intents to the service using startService when a button is clicked and it works fine. My service is a singelton so i can know if it is running br When in testing Im doing the followingp  ol liassert service isnt running.li lisend intent to start the service or press the button tried bothli liwait for the service to start and assert it is runningbrli ol  psounds pretty simple but when i try to wait using Thread.sleep the service wont start, and same for when i try doing busy waiting. So i assumed it will need to finish the testMethod to start the service and i made the following designbrp  precodeThread helper  Override tearDown      if helper join helper     super.tearDown   testMethod      assert stuff     send intent     start helper     finish   helperMethod      wait for service to start     assert stuff  codepre  pthis actually works, my guess is that it lets the main thread to finish the testMethod and then the intents are handled and my test finishes. This behavior seems very odd as i would expect that the service will start immediately as it is on the same thread or sleeping for enough time will let the service start. So anyone knows what are the conditions for the service to start, and when it happensp

Negative 10 pIm trying to make an app for detecting car maneuvers based on accelerometergyro data. To build a good classifier my data should be aligned to the car axesp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com53Pgk.png altenter image description herep  pI developed an algorithm that is supposed to calibrate a smartphone. At first it takes gravity vector to align axes in OXY plain. Then I construct a rotation matrix to find heading angle. It works p  pBut what if a user changes the position of a smartphone The calibration will be damaged. My question is how to deal with this problemp  pBasically physics laws tell us that it is impossible to distinguish accelerations the motion of a car itself and the motion of a smartphone inside a car using only local measurements. But there might be a way out. I can suggest two solutions p  ol liUsing GPS data as nonlocal measurement. We can handle all rotations using codeCoreMotioncode in case of iOS device. With a help of codedeviceMotioncode it is possible to measure rotations relatively to the initial position calibrated position. Matching sensor data with GPS tracks it it possible to find out which rotations were the result of a car turns and which  the result of a smartphone motion inside a car. Assuming that gravity vector is always available, it is enough to keep eyes on yaw rotation around Zaxis.li liSecond possible solution is gesture detection. I suppose its possible to train a classifier which would distinguish not only turns, lane change, etc., but also some gestures. They should definitely have different patterns from the point of accelerometergyro recordings.li ol  pBut these solutions seem quite complicated, so Im not sure they will be enough accurate.  p  pHas anybody successfully dealt with the same problem Are there any better solutions Any ideas are greatly appreciatedp  pThanksp

Ive been using the MockConnectionMockDataProvider objects to intercept every query, and this is working, but Im having a few issues.p  pFirst, how do I determine between reads and writes That is, how do I tell whether a query is an insertupdateetc or a select, given only the MockExecuteContext thats passed into the execute method in MockDataProviderp  pAnd Im a bit confused on how I can do invalidations. The basic scheme Im implementing right now is that whenever a write query is made to a table, I invalidate all cached queries that involve that table. This goes back to my first question, on telling different types of queries from each other, but also brings up another issue how would I identify the tables used in a query given only the sql string and the bindings both are attributes of MockExecuteContext p  pAlso, is this a correct approach at caching My first thought was to override the fetch method, but that method is final, and Id rather not change something already embedded in Jooq itself. This is the only other way I could think of to intercept all requests made so I could create a separate, persistent caching layer. p  pI have seen this a hrefhttpsgroups.google.comforumtopicjooquserxSjrvnmcDHw relnofollowhttpsgroups.google.comforumtopicjooquserxSjrvnmcDHwa question, but Im still not clear on how Lukas recommended to identify tables from the object. I can try to implement a Postgres NOTIFY, but I wanted something native in Jooq first. Ive seen this issue a hrefhttpsgithub.comjOOQjOOQissues2665 relnofollowhttpsgithub.comjOOQjOOQissues2665a pop up a lot too, but Im not sure how it applies. p  pKeep in mind that Im new to Jooq, so its quite possible that Im missing something obvious. p  pThanksp

Returning NO doesnt help at all, so i dont understand what that property even does... It has literally no effect. The same applies to the presentationStyle property  I dont see any effect when changing it.

I only know how to pull data from an API that returns a JSON object. Basically, I need to pull the xml code for the iframe and render that onto the page. Do I need to parse this into JSON, if not, how can I get this XML data to render onto my page My logic is that  1. Find a function that turns the XML data into a JSON object. 2. Pull the data from the object into a variable in my controller. 3. Write a partial template to show the view. 4. Include the variable in the template. 5. Write a route for that template view.p  pThis is an example of the xml data that I need to usep  precode    ltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt     lttrailersgt     lttrailergt     lttitlegtForrest Gump Featurette  IMAXlttitlegt     ltlinkgthttpwww.traileraddict.comforrestgumpfeaturetteimaxltlinkgt     ltpubDategtWed, 03 Sep 2014 125608 0700ltpubDategt     lttraileridgt94255lttraileridgt     ltimdbgtltimdbgt     ltembedgt     lt[CDATA[ltiframe width480 height270           srcv.traileraddict.com94255 allowfullscreentrue      webkitallowfullscreentrue mozallowfullscreentrue scrollingno      frameborder0gtltiframegtltpgtlta hrefhttpwww.traileraddict.comforrest     gumpfeaturetteimaxgtFeaturette  IMAXltagt for lta      hrefhttpwww.traileraddict.comforrestgumpgtForrest Gumpltagt on lta      hrefhttpwww.traileraddict.comgtTrailerAddictltagt.ltpgt]]gt     ltembedgt     lttrailergt     lttrailergt codepre

Negative 10 pIve got a sparse power set for an input ie some combos have been preexcluded. Each entry in the power set has a certain score.

So to read the table a key of 3 is code011code is base 2, which means linking 01 yields a score of 36, whereas 0 individually  1 individually yields a total sum of 11, therefore the linkage, code01code, is greater than the sum of its parts code0,1code.p  pIn doing so, Ive reduced this to a weighted subset sum problem, where the goal is to find every combination that sums to 15 the equivalent of code1111code in base 2 amp then take the max. This is where Im stuck. I tried using dynamic programming, but due to the randomness, I dont see how I can make any reductions. For example, code12code may be better than code1,2code in the above table, 3 has a higher score than 1  2.

Negative 10 pIm having trouble assigning a value to the int strongPlanPricestrong. Ive cut out a lot of code, but when the user presses the key a the AddCustomer function is called and they can input a lot of data which gets saved without a problem at all. But at the end of the strongAddCustomerstrong function, I use a switch to determine the price of their current plan. However when I try to use the strongPlanPricestrong int after this function has returned back to Main, the value is always 0.

Negative 10 pIve written a small command line utility to move and size the foreground window using SetWindowPos, but theres a pesky margin on either side of any window I moveresize. For example, on a 1920x1080 display, I use SetWindowPos to move Notepad to 0,0 and resize it to 960x540, it appears to move it to something like 10,0 with a size of 940x540. A subsequent call to GetWindowRect shows the current location as 0,0 and the size as 960x540, indicating that the space on either side of the window is being included as part of the window by SetWindowPos. Perhaps this is simply a design of the operating system, but how do I programatically determine the amount of space that I need to compensate for in order to override this and have the border of the window go against the edge of the screen similar to window snappingp

As far as I understand nobody can even try to hack the website because it will be not accessible from any IP not listed in the web.config Does this guarantee 100 protection  p  precodeltsecuritygt     ltipSecurity allowUnlistedfalsegt    lt this line blocks everybody, except those listed below gt                         ltcleargt lt removes all upstream restrictions gt         ltadd ipAddress127.0.0.1 allowedtruegt    lt allow requests from the local machine gt         ltadd ipAddress83.xxx.xx.53 allowedtruegt   lt allow the specific IP of 83.116.19.53  gt                         ltadd ipAddress83.xxx.xx.0 subnetMaskxxx.255.255.0 allowedtruegt   ltallow network 83.116.119.0 to 83.116.119.255gt                         ltadd ipAddress83.xxx.0.0 subnetMask2xx55.255.0.0 allowedtruegt   ltallow network 83.116.0.0 to 83.116.255.255gt                         ltadd ipAddress83.xxxx.0.0 subnetMask255.0.0.0 allowedtruegt   ltallow entire 8 network of 83.0.0.0 to 83.xxx.255.255gt                     ltipSecuritygt ltsecuritygt codepre
Negative 10 pI am developing an android game which seems to work absolutely fine on my two test devices Galaxy S3 and original Nexus 7. When the app run it looks like thisp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comoLuhO.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comoLuhO.png altworking screen shotap  pHowever whenever i send the apk to friends to try run it, the game doesnt render properly and ends up lookin like this p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comcR75m.jpg relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comcR75m.jpg altbroken screenshotap  por worse, they only draw the orange and blue arrows and the clear colour.p  pThe orange and blue arrows are part of my ui which use an orthographic camera but have primarily the same setting. The shader is different however but the second image shows that textures are being passed to the GPU at least semi effectively and the objects are in the right places. p  pThis is a bug i would be able to debug usually but i dont have access to the devices that dont work. So my question is Has anyone run into uch issue before or have any idea what might be going wrong p  pIm using Java and openGL ES 2.0. the galaxy and nexus are running android 4.3 and 4.2.2 respectively. the test devices which dont work are all newer. p
