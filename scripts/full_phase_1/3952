Positive 3952 pWe have a customer in the UK running BES 5.0.4 and Exchange not sure version can find out if needed. We are porting the customers mobile phone numbers between carriers. p  pThe problem is this if an email is received for a user while their SIM is in the dark period between providers during porting, the email message is not updated to the device when it fires up on the new network. To clarify the message is in the users email inbox, but never gets updated to the device.p  pMessages received AFTER the device registers on the new network are updated to the device fine.p  pThe customer has been advised by BB that this is normal behavior. However an exBB contractor has advised us that that is not so, and emails received during the porting blackout SHOULD be updated to the device.p  pDoes anyone have any experience of this, and are there any settingslogs we should advise them to look at As you can tell we are rather at arms length in this, but this issue is affecting our project and we would like to find an answer if possible. Any advice would be very welcome.p

Positive 3952 pOn Android, when a user purchases a consumable item in quotes since that distinction doesnt really exist any more since API v3, my app needs to actively a hrefhttpsdeveloper.android.comgoogleplaybillingapi.htmlconsume relnofollowstrongemconsumeemstronga the item before the user can buy another copy. When I query the currently owned items, only items that have not been consumed are included in the list. So, if I only consume items after making 100 sure that I have successfully credited the user with the benefits, there is no way that the user can get charged twice.p  pThis is similar to transactions in iOS that have not been a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryprereleaseiosdocumentationStoreKitReferenceSKPaymentQueueClassindex.htmlapplerefoccinstmSKPaymentQueuefinishTransaction relnofollowstrongemfinishedemstronga yet.p  pThe Blackberry Store also offers the distinction consumable vs. nonconsumable when creating a new item, but the a hrefhttpwww.blackberry.comdevelopersdocspayment1.8api relnofollowAPIa doesnt seem to offer any methods at all that mention consumability of items or apptriggered completion of a transaction.p  pSo, can a user just always purchase more copies of consumable items without my app having to actively consume the previous purchase first Even if there is a transaction that my app hasnt completed processing yetp  pIf so, how do I go about ensuring correct delivery of the item For example, if the users phone crashes after the purchase is made but before my app has the time to process the success notification, how do I find out about the pending transaction Are all previous purchases kept in the PurchaseHistory not just the current uncompleted ones like on Android Can I rely on the PurchaseHistory always being 100 accurate and up to date, so that I can reliably prevent my user from buying the same consumable item twice in the case where the success notification was droppedp  pDo consumable items show up in all PurchaseHistorys for a user account across all devices If so, I would need to make sure manually that the lets say inapp currency only gets added once to the device where it was purchased, correctp

Positive 3952 pI have built an Android app, and since now it is easily possible to create a .bar file blackberry app I decided to offer it also on blackberry. I got it running and everything works fine. p  pBut there is just this thing that the app still looks and feels like android I know, it is because it is android. I already made some modifications for the blackberry app, so you get more of the blackberry feeling, but it is still not perfect as far as I can tell. Right now I am sarching for BB10 screens of those controls that I am using, and I am trying to rebuild them in my android app.p  pIn order to fasten this process, I was wondering if there is a style, skin, theme or something similar which I could download and apply to my app so that all controls dropdowns, fonts, toolbar, text input ... get the blackberry style. p  pthanksp

Negative 3952 pWe have a large database on which we have DB side pagination. This is quick, returning a page of 50 rows from millions of records in a small fraction of a second.p  pUsers can define their own sort, basically choosing what column to sort by.  Columns are dynamic  some have numeric values, some dates and some text.p  pWhile most sort as expected text sorts in a dumb way. Well, I say dumb, it makes sense to computers, but frustrates users.p  pFor instance, sorting by a string record id gives something likep  precoderec1 rec10 rec14 rec2 rec20 rec3 rec4 codepre  p...and so on.p  pI want this to take account of the number, sop  precoderec1 rec2 rec3 rec4 rec10 rec14 rec20 codepre  pI cant control the input otherwise Id just format in leading 000s and I cant rely on a single format  some are things like alpha codedept coderec id.p  pI know a few ways to do this in C, but cant pull down all the records to sort them, as that would be to slow.p  pDoes anyone know a way to quickly apply a natural sort in Sql serverp  hr  pWere usingp  precodeROWNUMBER over order by field name asc codepre  pAnd then were paging by that.p  pWe can add triggers, although we wouldnt. All their input is parametrised and the like, but I cant change the format  if they put in rec2 and rec10 they expect them to be returned just like that, and in natural order.p  hr  pWe have valid user input that follows different formats for different clients.p  pOne might go rec1, rec2, rec3, ... rec100, rec101p  pWhile another might go grp1rec1, grp1rec2, ... grp20rec300, grp20rec301p  pWhen I say we cant control the input I mean that we cant force users to change these standards  they have a value like grp1rec1 and I cant reformat it as grp01rec001, as that would be changing something used for lookups and linking to external systems.p  pThese formats vary a lot, but are often mixtures of letters and numbers.p  pSorting these in C is easy  just break it up into code grp, 20, rec, 301 code and then compare sequence values in turn.p  pHowever there may be millions of records and the data is paged, I need the sort to be done on the SQL server.p  pSQL server sorts by value, not comparison  in C I can split the values out to compare, but in SQL I need some logic that very quickly gets a single value that consistently sorts.p  pmoebius  your answer might work, but it does feel like an ugly compromise to add a sortkey for all these text values.p

Negative 3952 pas developer of industrial vision applications I frequently have rather clunky images like 6000x4000Pixels and bigger.p  pWhile the camera and imageprocessing is working on a steady stream of new images and this processing is the main task I would like to allow the user to comfortably view some other image in parallel.p  pDoing this on the processor GDI etc. steals way too much performance. For example it takes us 0.2 seconds to analyse the image but 0.8 seconds to show it with a single zoom resized to fit some control, let alone let the user move on and dive into it.p  pSince Photoshop allows to show and zoom by the help of the graphic cards very fast memory and processing I wondered if anyone can give me an idea if and how I can experiment on this in my own code push data to graphic card how long may this take for my 76MB of rgbdata and let it show in some control without much effort to zoom and move in it by user  to the controlcard for user interaction.p  pNo need for 3D looks, just moving and resizing in a 2Drgbimage.  Aim is to enable fast and comfortable viewing with low processor load. p  p Is this possible as texture or something the like  Are there limitations with current lowend3Dcards of 256MB  can somebody suggest some durations to expect copy data, zoomingp  pThanks for any hintp
Negative 3952 pI use EntitySpaces for all of my Database related coding.

Im sitting on a breakpoint at that location in the debugger and can jump back up the stack and view the object instance that I need to get. I suspect that there is a way to get that instance from what I have codefoo.bar.baz.bla.bla.blacode or something like that but Im not knowledgeable enough about the code to know how to find it.p  pemHypothetical Exampleemp  blockquote   pIm sitting in the debugger at line 2485 in some one eases code and realize that the program needs to, right here, set the codeFooBatcode property on the enclosing codeWizBangcode object the one that the function 27 steps up the call stack was called on but I dont have any direct references to the enclosing codeWizBangcode object. However I suspect that one of the other object I do have access to has access to something that has access to something that does have access to the enclosing codeWizBangcode object. But that gives me about 10K things to look through and, oh by the way, I can also access 42 different codeWizBangcode objects that are not the one I want so I also need to check that it really is the same object as the one 27 steps up the stack. If I can just find how to get access to it I can add codeSomeExp.FooBat  truecode right here on line 2485 and close this bug p blockquote  pemMy question is has anyone made a tool that uses reflection and bruit force to search chains of properties and members to find one that will give a desired object instanceemp  pYes I know this is an codeObcodesupcodedcodesupcodecode problem and often wont work but its computer time, not programmer time and when it does work, it would be fantasticp  pp.s.

Negative 3952 pJust so you know I am learning to develop for iphone, without interfacae builderp  pIm coding my first multiview app, which has a root viewcontroller and two other viewcontrollers, and the root viewcontroller uses lazy loading, so when viewDidLoad, it creates the first viewcontroller and adds its view to the subview, but doesnt create the other one until it is needed. But, after the second one has loaded, they both stay there until the application ends unless it receives a memory warning.p  pSo Im wondering when the user switches two the other view, should I unload the other one thats being removed by setting it to nil  its a retaining property  So everytime the user clicks the button, the current viewcontroller is unloaded after being removed from the superview and the next one is loaded and added as a subviewp  pSo is this the right thing to do, or is it right, but only when the application has many views and mine isnt complicated enough to justify doing this, or is it bad to do it at all and I should just let didReceiveMemoryWarning take care of it In didReceiveMemoryWarning I set the viewcontroller that isnt currently being displayed to nil p

Negative 3952 pIm working on an application that contains several server sockets that each run in a unique thread.br An external utility script is called by one of the threads.  This script calls a utility client that sends a message to one of the server sockets.p  pInitially, I was using codesystemcode to execute this external script, but we couldnt use that because we had to make sure the server sockets were closed in the child that was forked to execute the external script.br I now call codeforkcode and codeexecvpcode myself.  I codeforkcode and then in the child I close all the server sockets and then call codeexecvpcode to execute the script.p  pNow, all of that works fine.  The problem is that at times the script reports errors to the server app.  The script sends these errors by calling another application client which opens a TCP socket and sends the appropriate data.  My issue is that the client app gets a value of code0code returned by the codesocketcode system call.p  pNOTE This ONLY occurs when the scriptclient app is called using my forkExec function.

Negative 3952 pIn my application I have a table of application events that are used to generate a userspecific feed of application events. Because it is generated using an OR query, Im concerned about performance of this heavily used query and am wondering if Im approaching this wrong.p  pIn the application, users can follow both other users and groups. When an action is performed eg, a new post is created, a codefeeditemcode record is created with the codeactoridcode set to the users id and the codesubjectidcode set to the group id in which the action was performed, and codeactortypecode and codesubjecttypecode are set to the class names of the models. Since users can follow both groups and users, I need to generate a query that checks both the actorid and subjectid, and it needs to select distinct records to avoid duplicates. Since its an OR query, I cant use an normal index. And since a record is created every time an action is performed, I expect this table to have a lot of records rather quickly.p  pHeres the current query the codefollowingcode table joins users to codefeederscode, aka, users and groupsp  precodeSELECT DISTINCT feeditems.

Negative 3952 pIm currently rewriting an eshop  but only the client side, i.e. the CMS remains mostly in tact. I am not using a prebuilt framework, as the system has to retain backwards compatibility with the CMS and I have to have full freedom of the structure of code. p  pThe new system is purely MVC based and I have a Bootstrapper which loads controllers based on the current uri and the latter use models for the real work  both with sessions and the database.p  pstrongtldrstrong Its my first project without a prebuilt framework.p  pI am very inexperienced when it comes to design patterns. I know how do most of the popular ones work but have had never put them to use. p  pNow I am suspecting code smells because all of my models are classes that consist purely of static methods. I can find no advantages of doing them in a different manner. I routinely need some of the methods in various places through out the code. I.e. I need to fetch the logged in user in the main layout, check user rights to see current page in the bootstraper, display user panel by the controller. Id need to reinstantiate an object each time or keep a global one if I wasnt using statics. There also wont be a need for more than one such class at a time.p  pI must be missing something, because even though I use OOP, some my classes are just meaningless containers for their methods and sometimes a couple of private variables. I could have just been using PHP4 and simple functions.p  pAny comments or advice would be highly appreciated.p  pstrongEDITstrong in spite of all these educated answers, I remain unconvinced. Even though its most probably because of my lack of experience, I still dont foresee anything going wrong with the current setup. I mean I dont even fathom a situation where Id have any inconveniences due to the code architecture as it is now. I hope I dont get a harsh lesson when its too late to change anything...p

Negative 3952 pI want to create a very large array on which I write 0s and 1s. Im trying to simulate a physical process called random sequential adsorption, where units of length 2, dimers, are deposited onto an ndimensional lattice at a random location, without overlapping each other. The process stops when there is no more room left on the lattice for depositing more dimers lattice is jammed.p  pInitially I start with a lattice of zeroes, and the dimers are represented by a pair of 1s. As each dimer is deposited, the site on the left of the dimer is blocked, due to the fact that the dimers cannot overlap. So I simulate this process by depositing a triple of 1s on the lattice. I need to repeat the entire simulation a large number of times and then work out the average coverage . p  pIve already done this using an array of chars for 1D and 2D lattices.

Negative 3952 pMy simulation model contains agents on a surface. Agents are represented by codeclass Agentcode, their locations by codeclass Pointcode, and the surface itself by codeclass Surfacecode. Each point is really just a pair of numbers.p  pTo model an agents movement, I need to know which surface hes on e.g., on a torus, he would never hit a lands end, but on a cylinder, he will.p  pMy question is whether I should add to codeclass Pointcode, as an instance attribute, a reference to the codeSurfacecode object.p  pIf I do, codeclass Pointcode becomes more complicated, and efficiency suffers instead of dealing with pairs of numbers, Ill be dealing with pairs of numbers plus a reference. This is especially annoying since theres only one instance of codeclass Surfacecode ever instantiated in a single program run.p  pIf I dont, I would not be able to give codeclass Agentcode a codemovecode method. Instead Id have to model agents movement from an outer class that is aware of both the surface and individual agents. This approach seems logically less appealing.p
Negative 3952 pAlrighty guys, Im writing an application that I want to be crossplatform. Up until recently Ive been trying to do this in Silverlight with C because it also runs on OS X, but with me being fairly rusty with C in addition to being new to Silverlight Ive run into headache after headache. Most of this stems from the restrictions that come along with an application thats intended to run in a browser, issues with it running differently when running from my development sever vs directly from a file, etc.p  pId rather completely abandon the whole OS X support idea than have to completely rewrite the app for OS X, especially since I have utterly NO experience writing for it. What Im hoping to be able to do is write a regular app in C .NET with Visual Studio for Windows and then easily port it to OS X with Mono.p  pstrongHow difficult is it to bring a .NET app over to OS X with Monostrong My app is fairly straightforward, theres nothing exotic going on with the forms or anything, so Id have to assume that itd be supported in Monos WinForms implementation.p  pstrongAre there any good resources out there on how to port an app using Mono Or, perhaps, am I missing the entire point and it simply lets you run .NET apps on OS X and I dont need to bother with portingstrongp  pForgive my utter ignorance on the subject, I only started considering going this route like 10 minutes ago after running into yet another annoying restriction in Silverlight.p  pIll be the emfirstem to admit that I dont know my head from my ass about this subject, so be gentle.. p

Negative 3952 pI was just wondering if it was a good idea to override codeequalscode and codehashCodecode for mutable collections. This would imply that if I insert such a collection into a codeHashSetcode and then modify the collection, the codeHashSetcode would no longer be able to find the collection. Does this imply that only immutable collections should override codeequalscode and codehashCodecode, or is this a nuisance Java programmers simply live withp

Negative 3952 pHey guys, Im implementing a Table View into my project. First I populated my table, then I manage to successfully create 4 categories and give a number of rows in each of those categories, but heres my problem.

But on the second category which has 3 objects, the 3 objects are actually opening nib files from the first category, which is not what I want.

I find it to be quite useful in my projects, and I hope someone else can find use for it.p  pThe important thing to point out is that the derived class passes itself in the generic signature to the base class.p  pIf anyone has seen this pattern in use, or knows of a name for it  I would really love to see some examples, or at least call it by its correct name  For now, Im calling it recursive generics, since it seems to fit, but Im sure theres a better namep  h2Thank you very much for your helph2  pAdamp

Negative 3952 pToday I was looking the latest exam of the local informatics olympiad and I found a interesting problem. Briefly, it asks to, given an integer array, count how many inversions it has, where an inversion is a pair of indicies codeicode, codejcode such that codei gt jcode and codeA[i] lt A[j]code. Informally, the number of inversions is the number of pairs that are out of order. Initially I made a codeOncode solution yes, the naive one, but seeing it wouldnt fit well with the size of the input, I thought about the problem a bit more and then I realized its possible to do it within codeOn log ncode time by a variant of merge sort, which handles good the size of the input.p  pBut seeing the input constraints codencode integers between code1 and Mcode, and no duplicates, I was wondering if my solution is optimal, or do you know if is there any other solution to this problem that beats codeOn log ncode runtimep

Negative 3952 pAlright dudes... I have a problem that is looking for an answer more specific than the seemingly obvious solution.p  pI have a block of code that I want to execute directly after a url is known to be valid. What I mean by valid is that the program has checked to see if that filepath actually exists. This could be accomplished by a COMPLETE listener, because after all, a loader couldnt finish loading its content if the referenced file didnt exist, but I want it to happen before any of the bytes begin to get sucked in.  I have also tried the HTTPSSTATUS event, with a conditional saying if the status is this [some nonerror status number], then run this block of code. This would have worked great, except that different environments produce different network codes, and some even cant distinguish between errors and nonerrors, just returning 0s no matter what. Because of this, I cant write a conditional that works no matter what browser....p  pSo, anyone got any ideasp

Negative 3952 pA bit of a long title, but what I am trying to ask is this  Is there a hash function, given two data streams A and B, returns a message digest where the difference between the message digests themselves are proportional to the difference in the original streams  p  pFor example, is A and B are vastly different, then hA  FA3DB31 and hB  DA812DB.  If A and B are pretty similar, then hA  FA3DB31 and hB  FB4DB42p  pMy specific case for this is, comparing two music files and determining if they are the same song despite different original sampling settings when they were recorded.  I initially thought maybe computing a running average with a large enough window might work, but that seems like it would have problems when dealing with different bitrates without converting to equal bitrates being an option.  Also, I dont have the option to do beat detection and compare the sequences of beats between the songs.p

Negative 3952 pIve written a little Ruby script that takes a file of URLs, checks for the existence of a link to a website specified as a command line parameter on the webpage of that URL and, if the link is not marked nofollow, it prints the URL to STDOUT. The purpose of the program is to filter out websites that link to the specified website but do not pass link juice. p  pIt works okay, however, the script takes hours to check 3000 webpages. I would like to improve this, mostly for fun and to learn some techniques for solving this type of problem in the future. My primary goal is to rewrite the program in such a way that its able to saturate the network connection because network IO is the current bottleneck.p  pNow, I have no idea what the best way to tackle this would be. I understand structuring a program in an eventdriven manner is often used to write efficient network code and that the alternative seems to be using threads. Its my incorrect understanding, though, that Ruby doesnt really support concurrent programming because the Ruby runtime uses a global lock. p  pI currently know C, also, but, if theres some other language thats particularly suited to this kind of thing especially on a large scale, think millions of URLs instead of thousands, I can dedicate some time to learning that language because I plan on building some similar programs in the future. Right tool for the job and all that.p  pSo, my questions are, roughlyp  ul liIs Ruby or C a suitable candidate for solving this problem in an efficient mannerli liHow would I structure such a program What libraries should I useli ul  pIf neither Ruby nor C are suitablep  ul liWhat language would be a good fit for this type of programli liHow would I structure such a program What libraries should I useli ul  pHeres what my script looks like right nowp  precodeargument parsing code omitted  def dofollowlink   if not link.attrrel.nil     if link.attrrel.includenofollow       return false     end   end   return true end  options  parseARGV  File.openoptions.file, r do file  file.each do website     begin       doc  NokogiriHTMLopenwebsite       doc.cssa.each do link         if link.attrhref.includeoptions.url ampamp dofollowlink           puts website           break         end       end     rescue     end   end end codepre

But I cant find anything online about how to rollback to GCC 4.0 or if it comes shipped with 2011 MacBooks and there is some way to force JPype to compile with that instead. pli ol  pThere is a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7103024neo4jjpypeinstallationissueanother similar questiona, but the solution there is to use a different adapter that goes through REST instead of hooking directly into Java. I will try that if I have to, but I would really rather use the recommended Neo4j method if its possible.p

Negative 3952 pIm developing a messaging system and I would like to display when a user is typing or not. How I figured I would do it is just have a table in my database called typing with the columns for who is typing and who theyre typing to and the time. Every time they press a key in the input field I would post to the database seems like this would slow the site down though. Then Id run some javascript that checks if the column in the typing field is older than 5 seconds, if not then I display the message, if it is then I remove it.p  pThis seems to be a pretty straightforward way to do it, but I was wondering if there is a better option. I am uncomfortable with such frequent posts to the database. So does anyone know a better way this can be accomplished Any help is appreciated, thank you.p

Probably many of you are too young to remember those days.p  pSomeplace in there is a memory management problem which causes strange things to happen sometimes. I have long since passed the point where thirdparty solutions like Purify can be used on this program. They just bomb when I try to instrument the code. So I have written my own mallocfree and I am hooking these up to keep better track of what is happening to the memory. So far, I am allocating all the memory with my own system, but in this case it is going to the normal free instead of mine, with predictable results. p

Negative 3952 pIm using epoll to write large messages to a server using HTTP protocol. The fds are all set to nonblocking and Im using edgetriggered events. I know for EPOLLIN I need to loop over reading the fd until EAGAIN is returned. For writing I am unsure if I should keep looping once I get EAGAIN or should I wait for epoll to notify when the fd is available for read again.p  pFor instance, I am writing a 20K message, and on the first write attempt the amount of data sent  13K. The next attempt to write returns a retVal  1 and errno  EAGAIN. p  pAt this point should I continue looping in a while1 until I can write the data or should I wait for epoll to invoke my call back when the FD is ready for writing again. My understanding is that since the fd is registered for writing, epoll should notify me when the FD is ready for writing again. But that doesnt seem to be happening in my program.p  pDo I need to set a special flag or modify the FD to get the notification p

Negative 3952 pIm developing CC software for an embedded Linux system with the AT91SAM9G20 processor from Atmel.  I need to quickly compute the FFT using fixedpoint or perhaps floatingpoint math using a Linux userspace program.  I understand that assembler might be the way to go here with respect to the implementation, and that an additional mpcu switch might be required when compiling using the gcc compiler.  What is the best way to proceed with this implementation, and are there any good book references or optimized FOSS libraries availablep  pI have to implement some algorithms that also require small FFT lengths i.e 1024 points to be applied a number of times and I would wonder if some libraries such as kissfft would work just as well.  Im also interested in long FFT lengths, so the FFTW as suggested in an answer below would work well too.p  pAs a related aside to this question, I am also wondering how integer division is handled in an ARM9 Linux userspace program.  If I divide two integers such as 25  4, is the division done using soft floating point numbers  I need to also implement some heavy number crunching algorithms, and I am wondering if fixedpoint is better to use here than floating point math, and how the gcc compiler really handles things.p

Negative 3952 pWhen using DbContext in a databasefirst scenario I found out that adding and deleting entities is very slow compared to ObjectContext. If adding 2000 entities and saving the changes at the end, DbContext is 3 to 5 times slower than ObjectContext btw. I know that adding a large amount of entities would be better using SqlBulkCopy but thats not the point. If saving changes after each addition DbContext is still nearly two times slower. When it comes to deletion it even gets worse When saving at the end of all entity removals, DbContext is around 18 times slower than ObjectContext. p  pI took my highly developed test application I use to compare database access technologies and a small console application to double check.

Negative 3952 pIm developing a mobile app. I have a view with an horizontal list, each item has a long description so I would need a vertical scroll for that independent information. Im trying to add an scroll as a Child of an itemRenderer. And I dont get it. Anyone knows what Im doing bad I have a class with inheritance of ItemRenderer I tried BaseRenderer from AsFusion too, that it seems to have more performance for mobile apps, with the same result.  And here is the part of the scroll from my codep  precode    override protected function createChildrenvoid              super.createChildren         scroller  new VScrollBar         scroller.percentHeight  100         scroller.setStyleright, 0         scrollGroup  new Group         scrollGroup.percentHeight  100         scrollGroup.percentWidth  100         super.addElementscroller         super.addElementscrollGroup          scroller.viewport  scrollGroup      codepre  pI also tried p  precode    override protected function createChildrenvoid              super.createChildren         scroller  new Scroller         scroller.percentHeight  100         scroller.percentWidth  100         scrollGroup  new Group         scrollGroup.percentHeight  100         scrollGroup.percentWidth  100         super.addElementscroller         super.addElementscrollGroup          scroller.viewport  scrollGroup      codepre  pAnd the result is the same. An empty item in the list. I can change page pagesnapping of the list horizontal scroll and the next item is also empty. If I delete addElementscroller I can see the items perfectly, but without the vertical scroll that I really need. So the problem is in the scroller. Any idea what Im doing so bad Please I need the solution in actionscript, I have more itemrenderers done and I will make inheritance, and the performance for the mobile is better in actionscript.

predicate like this predicate  [NSPredicate predicateWithFormatstring1  , string1]   clearly shows that string1 is not indexed anymoreem br br Following that, I create a new version of the datamodel, with a meaningless update, just to force a lightweight migrationbr If run on the simulator, the migration takes a few seconds, the database doubles in size and the same query now takes less than a second to return instead of minutes.br This would solve my problem, force a migration, but that same migration takes 3 minutes on the iPad and happens in the foreground.br So hats where I am at right now, the best solution for me would still be to prevent the indexes to be removed, any other importing solution at launch time just takes too much time.br Let me know if you need more clarifications...p  pstrongUpdate 2strongbr So the best result I have had so far is to seed the core data database with the sqlite file produced from a quick tool with similar data model, but without the indexes set when producing the sqlite file. Then, I import this sqlite file in the core data app with the indexes set, and allowing for a lightweight migration. For 2 millions record on the new iPad, this migration stills take 3 minutes. The final app should have 5 times this number of records, so were still looking at a long long processing time.  If I go that route, the new question would be can a lightweight migration be performed in the backgroundp  pstrongUpdatestrongbr My question is NOT how to create a tool to populate a Core Data database, and then import the sqlite file into my app.br I know how to do this, I have done it countless times.br But until now, I had not realized that such method could have some side effect in my case, an indexed attribute in the resulting database clearly got unindexed when importing the sqlite file that way.br If you were able to verify that any indexed data is still indexed after such transfer, I am interested to know how you proceed, or otherwise what would be the best strategy to seed such database efficiently. brbr strongOriginalstrongp  pI have a large CSV file millions of lines with 4 columns, strings and floats. This is for an iOS app.brbr I need this to be loaded into core data the first time the app is loaded.brbr The app is pretty much non functional until the data is available, so loading time matters, as a first time user obviously does not want the app to take 20 minutes to load before being able to run it.brbr Right now, my current code takes 20 min on the new iPad to process a 2 millions line csv file.brbr I am using a background context to not lock the UI, and save the context every 1,000 recordsbrbr The first idea I had was to generate the database on the simulator, then to copypaste it in the document folder at first launch, as this is the common non official way of seeding a large database. Unfortunately, the indexes dont seem to survive such a transfer, and although the database was available after just a few seconds, performance is terrible because my indexes were lost. I posted a question about the indexes already, but there doesnt seem to be a good answer to that.br br So what I am looking for, eitherp  ul lia way to improve performance on loading millions of records in core datali liif the database is preloaded and moved at first startup, a way to keep my indexesli libest practices for handling this kind of scenario.

Negative 3952 pI apologize in advance if this is a duplicate, Im not sure exactly what I should be searching for.p  pRecently I watched a hrefhttpchannel9.msdn.comShowsCloudCoverEpisode69SQLAzureFederationswithGeorgeHuey relnofollowthis nifty video on Channel 9 about database federation in SQL Azurea. At first I was surprised by the fact that identity columns are not supported by SQL Azure Federation, but it makes sense. If you have a table that is split between 2 or more databases, and they have no way to share their identity increment value, you could end up with 2 or more entities sharing the same primary key.p  pThe video touched lightly on how to deal with this problem, mentioning using something like a Guid for a PK instead of an integerbased identity column. I know that at least MSSQL will create a clustered index on the PK by default, and it is bad to have a clustered index on a Guid or uniqueidentifier type. Im by no means a relational expert, but I also believe that Guids have a performance degradation when compared to integerbased types for PKbased lookups.p  pSo this got me wondering, what might an integerbased PK pattern look like for a horizontally federated database look like Back when I wrote old school EJBs and we needed to generate an integer for a primary key, we had to have a separate sequence lookup table to replace the rdbms identityautoincrement features. I recall this was was painful, as many other things with EJBs were back then.p  pWhat are the commonlyaccepted patterns, if any, for assigning primary keys in a horizontally federated database table Given my current knowledge I would lean away from Guids because of performance degradation, and I would lean away from sequential lookup indices because of development cost and added complexity mostly development cost. What should I be leaning strongtowardstrongp

To be honest, I have not found  a way to find out the sample time other than codeAudioQueueDeviceGetCurrentTimecode, which I cannot use, since I do not use an codeAudioQueuecode. However changing the codeioActionFlagcode to  codekAudioTimeStampHostTimeValidcode does not change the the error behaviour.p

Negative 3952 pIm developing a website. Im creating dropdown lists as menus for the website. Ive created hidden divs that appear when you hover over the link in the top menu. However, I can not figure out how to get them to center based upon their parents. Im assuming its because theyre positioned absolute, but I dont know how else I could create the hidden DIVs that overlay other stuff without them being absolute. I wouldnt really know what sections of my code to post, so if you want to know what Im talking about, go to www.theguildwars2hq.com and hover over the links at the top. Youll notice they all start at the left border of the link above them. Id like them to automatically center around the links, but at the topoffset theyre coded. I want them to also automatically be the 100 width of their parents, but every time I try that, it 100s to another div Im not even certain of, but I think is content.p  pAlso, is there a way to make a div automatically create a second column once the div has reached a certain heightp  pI hope this made some sense, if very little. Its hard to explain my point without having something physical to present and point out. p

Negative 3952 pCan someone give me a best approach in using HMVC Modular Extension in CodeIgniter.

I call it in the view of the site using echo modulesrunsearchsearchsearchform and when I submit the form I wanted to output the result in the current page so I store the searchresults in a session variable to let the current page access the search results, but I think its not a good idea because sessions has a 4kb limit if Im not mistaken.

Negative 3952 pIve got a problem with tests. There is an algorithm for some fancy procedure. This algorithm takes a random number from a range [999,999 999,999], treats it like an id number from a table and performs some random operations in the database. This means that I need to call the method huge number of times to be sure that the random number distribution is correct.p  pI wanted to make all the code using TDD just to learn it a little bit more.p  pThe problem is that I dont know how to test the algorithm with TDD principle in mind.p  pAccording to TDD, no code should be run without writing a test first.p  pOne of the solutions I think of is to have a dummy method in the main class called debugtext. This method will do nothing in the production code. However then Id make a subclass with this method being overloaded and this time it would store some interesting information. This information could be later used by test to find out if the function works properly. The database connection will be mocked and will do nothing.p  pAnother solution would be to create a mocked database connection which would store the interesting information, used later in tests. However it would be so huge amount of work to create such a connection that I dont think is worth spending time on it.p  pThere will be integration tests later to check if the database is changed properly. But integration tests are not part of TDD.p  pHave I got into a place where TDD fails and is useless or too hard to usep

Negative 3952 pI have created an application for iPhone interface which displays a codeUITableViewcode as its rootviewcontroller. When we select any of its row, it opens the corresponding detailViewController, we select the value from there and it is displayed in the cells of codeUITableViewcode in masterViewController. This application was running perfectly fine in iPhone simulator as desired.p  pNow I want to incorporate this application to an iPad application. For that purpose, I have created a codeUIPopOvercode and assigned the masterViewController to the popover. Now the problem is, codeUITableViewcode is initially shown in the popover. But when we select any row, next view doesnt appear in popover as it appeared when application was running solely for iPhone. How should I make it work so that I can import the application with original functionality in codeUIPopOvercodep
Negative 3952 pI would like to implement undoredo in a small a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma12683632418556paint applicationa.  It seems the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiCommandpattern relnofollowCommand Patterna fits the use nicely, but I am unsure how to best implement it.p  pAs I understand the pattern, it is necessary to include in each commandp  ol liThe details of the paint operation for purposes of redo e.g. Line  start amp end points, free form line  codeGeneralPathcodeli liThe state of the component prior to the change for undo.  In this case, that will be a small snapshot image of the area affected by the command.li ol  pMy understanding based on that is that each command needs to be atomic or self contained, with all the information needed for undoredo that operation.p  pUnfortunately that would require storing more information than Id first anticipated.  For a line we must also account for things like the codeColorcode, codeStrokecode and codeRenderingHintscode used to draw it initially.  This turns my simple little commands into something ..more bulky in memory, and with more boilerplate code to churn out each will be a serializable beansup1sup.p  pFor reasons of memory conservation mostly I was wanting to cheat on the specification of the commands.  Perhaps take a backup of the entire drawing area every 100th update, but otherwise store no part of the changed image, and simply rebuild the last up to 100 commands for each new paint operation.  But that seems problematic to ensure that the state of the codeGraphicscode object is right before painting each part  this part might require a line, but the codeRenderingHintscode were changed 4 commands ago, the codeColorcode was changed 98 commands ago, while the codeStrokecode has remained the same for the last 227 commands.p  pPursuing a more memory efficient command seems to throw the pattern right out the window in terms of being atomic.  That in turn leads to difficulties in determining the earliest command that might affect the rendering.p  pShould Ip  ul liLook for a new patternli liAttempt to implement my peculiar needs by tweaking the patternli liToss all this in the waste bin as premature optimization and code it in the simplest and most memory consuming way that sticks to the command pattern as definedli ul  h2Updateh2  ol liemeach will be a serializable beanem  On 2nd thoughts, no.  I did dome checks to find that a codeGraphics2Dcode which neatly encapsulates many parameters used when drawing is not serializable.  Further, a codeBasicStrokecode strongisstrong serializable, but the thickness of the stroke is not stored.  I could create serializable versions of many of the attributes but it seems to make for a lot more code, so Im going to abandon that spec. as well.  I will only attempt to store a reference to a codeBufferedImagecode at runtime.li ol

This will not fit into memory on the server that I need to run it on.p  pIm wondering what interesting methods are out there for solving this problem.p  pWhat Ive come up with so far is reading subsets of each original set from disk that are small enough to fit into memory, then intersecting each subset, and writing those to disk temporarily.

I chose this size for the window because this is the size of my background image and I am not intending on making the actual page scrollable. All of my content is supposed to just fit within the fixed window. p  pHowever, Im noticing discrepancies among browsers.

On my girlfriends computer, also a Macbook Pro, this problem also occurs. But, when I test the website on my iMac desktop, which happens to have Safari, Chrome, and Firefox all installed, the window opens up to the correct dimensions, with no extra white space. Finally, although I havent been able to see it functioning in person, Ive been told that there is white space added at the bottom AND on the right side of my background when the website is opened up on a Windowsbased computer. p  pThe link to the splash page is a hrefhttpwww.jamesbarracca.com relnofollowhttpwww.jamesbarracca.coma p  pCan you please tell me why I am having this issue Thank you p

Negative 3952 pI need to pause a for loop and not continue until I specify. For each item in the array that Im looping through, I run some code that runs an operation on a separate device, and I need to wait until that operation is finished before looping to the next item in the array.p  pFortunately, that codeoperation is a cursor and features an codeaftercode section.p  pHowever, its been running the entire for loop instantly, which I need to prevent. Is there any way to prevent the loop from continuing until specified Or perhaps a different type of loop or something that I should usep  pMy first poor idea was to make a whileloop within the forloop that ran continuously, until the codeaftercode portion of the cursor set a codebooleancode to codetruecode. This just locked up the browser  As I feared it would.p  pAnything I can do Im fairly new to javascript. Ive been enjoying my current project though.p  pHeres the codewhileloopcode attempt.

Negative 3952 pI would like to start developing for iOS. Coming from an Android developing background, I know that the more types of devices you can get your hands on, the better testing will be, as all devices have wildly different specs, and what may work perfectly in your test device may not even run in another one, let alone look good.p  pI know that testing on the actual device is very important, as there are many limitations on what you can test on an emulator, so Ive decided to get an actual device.p  pHowever, there are also tons of devices available in the iOS world Theres the iPod touch, the iPad and the iPhone, each in several different generations and configurations 8GB version vs 16GB version, WiFi version, 3G version, etc.. Not also the screen sizes, but also the aspect ratio is very different across devices, and also the included sensors.p  pI think that getting an application to emrunem in varied devices should not be difficult, but is it necessary to actually test on all the device types you plan to support Apple is not renown for its low price, and I would like to keep the starting costs as low as possible.p  pSo, to conclude Is it necessaryrecommended to test on as many device types as you can in the iOS development worldp  pA small clarification Im specially asking if it is possible for there to be compatibility issues related to a specific devicefamilyofdevices that I would not be able to catch either by testing on the emulator nor a totally different device.p

The same applies to each objects Draw function. Every class holds a pointer to the game window so it can achieve these things and theyre also passed a number of variables from Game, such as what key is currently being pressed and also the elapsed time for movement calcs.p  pAll seemed fine and dandy up to here  then I met collisions. Whilst I understand the basis of how they work, Ive tried two or three different approaches to implementing them. At first I began with just having the Player class hold a bunch of functions such as CollidesWith Beetleamp b  and CollidesWith Platformamp plat . Obviously this is extremely strenuous when testing against every object in my level including gems of course and I began to consider how to implement broad phase collision detection. I then tried using an AABB class defined by 2 2DVectors SFMLs built in class. And this is where I got slightly stuck and decided to come and ask for help here. I went back to testing collisions using purely the size of the sprites as they are defined by a box  the same as AABBs, right but Im not sure this iswas a wise path to take.p  pBefore I make a serious mess up of whatre the good foundations of a game, can anyone offer some friendly advice on a good way to implement broad phase and narrow phase collision detection I had narrow working quite well at one stage and then I realised that a player could still move through the side of a platform, heh. p  pShould I create a dedicated class for collisions Or should I continue as I was, using the size of the sprites of each object each object has its own sprite and image  in fact Ill show an examplep  precodeclass BaseEntity  public  Constructors BaseEntity BaseEntitysfRenderWindow gameWin, string imgPath, sfVector2f position  sfVector2f0,0, sfVector2f velocity  sfVector2f0,0 virtual BaseEntity  Setters void SetCurrentPossfVector2f newPos  Set the current position  void SetPreviousPossfVector2f newPrevPos  Shouldnt be needed but there may be rare circumstances void SetCurrentVelsfVector2f newVel  Set the velocity   Getters sfVector2f GetCurrentPos  Returns the current position values sfVector2f GetPreviousPos  Returns the previous position values sfVector2f GetCurrentVel  Returns the current velocity values   void virtual SetSpritestring imgPath  Set up the images for the sprite  void virtual Updatefloat elapsedTime  The function that handles the updating of movement void virtual Draw  The function that handles the Draw aspect of this object  protected   sfRenderWindow pGameWin  A pointer to the game window used for drawing sfVector2f currentPos sfVector2f previousPos sfVector2f currentVel sfSprite mySprite  This objects sprite sfImage myImage  This objects image  codepre  pThe player class inherits from this and has a few extra functions such as CheckBoundaries, CollidesWith, Jump and also holds a few variables  bool isColliding may be of interest in this scenario.p  pCheers guys, and sorry for the essayp

Negative 3952 pI was wondering, is there any good data sharing strategy, among Activities, and a spawned remote service running in separate process. So far, I had tried 3 methods, none of them work.p  h2Use codeApplicationcodeh2  pI first thought, there will be only an codeApplicationcode, shared among 2 different processes, as their are origin from a single application. p  pBut that is not the case. I realize, before a main codeActivitycode is created, an codeApplicationcode will be created. When I spawn a remote service, another new codeApplicationcode instance will be created too.p  h2Use codePreferencescodeh2  pMy first thought is that, this is a file based. So, whenever I write a value to codePreferencescode through codesharedPreferences.edit.putStringkey, value.commitcode, the change will be committed to file. Another process should be able to read the latest changes. p  pBut this is not the case. My guess is that, this is because in my service, I acquire the codePreferencescode instance only once during service start up through codePreferenceManager.getDefaultSharedPreferencesapplicationcode. It only read value from file during 1st time. Subsequent call codegetStringcode will be read from memory.p  h2Use Global Static Variablesh2  pNot workable as codeActivitycode and remote codeServicecode are in 2 different processes. They are having 2 different memory spaces.p  pAny better strategy I can try outp

Negative 3952 pIve got a general question about daemons in C, that I havent seen an answer to by now.p  pIs there a way how one should implement the control of a daemon process, like a convention or standardp  pRest is further explanationp  pI have seen multiple documents teaching the basics how to create a daemon in C. Forking, closing file descriptors, changing root, etc... no problem. And they all stop, when the process enters a endless loop when the daemon process is created  so to say. But this is only half the way when it comes to coding a daemon you have to control it emsomehowem. I can make it work different ways, but I have the feeling there is a lot more to it.p  pFor this checking if there is a process already running or for stopping a running daemon process, or ... I have seen different approaches UNIX sockets, file locks, pidfiles, ... with their pros and cons. But it seemed to me like opinions or personal flavors why dont you just... or Ive done it this way, it worked for me. And I am not sure if this is a sign of freedom or not.p  pI mean, if you take a look at sshd, httpd, syslogd, etc... they all can be controlled via initscripts or the service command startstopstatus. This looks like a standard. But is this just some loose convention a lot of people try to follow or is there some kind of framework in the deep sea of C functions Do you have to make it work emsomehowem  for example make your program respond to a stop argument and end the daemon process emsomehowem Or is there some kind of standard, convention, a UNIXway, best practices... that one should follow to write good, clean code and that integrates well in most environmentsp  pMy main question comes down to Is there a way its meant to be done p  pAnd if so, where could I find more information I guess there is more to take care of, than just starting and stopping.p

Negative 3952 pThis whole thing started when I began working on an Adobe Air App that was until now a completely single player game. The question I have is whether it is possible to alert a user when it is their turn without using a polling technique  without continually checking... is it my turn yet . The technologies I have at my disposal are pretty much just AIR, PHP, and MySQL. I currently have a shared hosting package with no ssh support in which I am sure I will change soon this year to a dedicated package with ssh support.p  pWith these technologies would that be possiblep  pThe idea  direction I have been going down is. p  pSetting up a PHP Socket Program to maintain the connection between users and having a common domain the AIR applications will connect to. For example. My phone would POST to my.domain.com which would execute a php script to start a Socket Server execphp socket.php  All users of the application would join a pool in the server if it was running in which  my theory is that  I can maintain bidirectional communication with them. The MySQL server can be used to track if the socket is open and who is currently in the pool. Is this possiblep  pI also think I would not be able to notify users when the app is closed as they would no longer be in the socket.p  pIm just wondering if I am way off base here.p
Negative 3952 pI am using UserForm to build a Fruit Machine.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comjExXc.png altuserformp  pEvery time you press command button Play, 3 random values 09 display in top TextBoxes, a random nudge generate in middle TextBox 0  3 and credit gets down by 10. If the 3 values on top are the same then you win. When nudge is higher than 0, you can click spin button and change the value to make them the same you win by using nudge. Every time you click spin, you loose one nudge. And when nudge is 0, the spin are unable to click. The other part top up credit is quite selfexplain.p  pMy problem  The Fruit Machine works quite well except for one situation when you click Play and the nudge is 1, and then you click any of the spin but the win criteria is not met, i.e. the numbers are still not the same. Then the nudge value suddenly endlessly goes down, and the top value to the left of the spin you clicked also endlessly goes updown depends on which you click, up or down . It seems that the SpinUpSpinDown is looping itself and I cannot stop or click anything else until break it.p  pI cannot find any bugs in my code and have no idea why this happens.

Negative 3952 pIm trying to use Autofac to inject dependencies into FluentValidation in an MVC 4 app.  I think Ive got the strategy worked out, but Im getting stuck with resolving my perrequest ISomething from a singleton.p  pHeres the scenario Ive got a validator that derives from FluentValidations AbstractValidator.  Ive read that FluentValidation validators perform best as singletons, so my constructor expects a Func and stores that Factory for use later.  When the validator is used, it should ask the stored factory for an IDataStore, get the instance created for that request and use it.  Thats the theory.

Negative 3952 pIm working on creating a student database in C. The final thing I need to be able to do read and write the database I create to a file. So Ive already got an array full of pointers to student structures, and I need to write it to a file. Once I have it written, I need to be able to read it back into my array as well. p  pIm really not sure how to do it though. This is my structp  precodetypedef struct student Student struct student       char name[300]     int age     char course1[300]     char course2[300]     char remarks[300]   Student Data[30] codepre  pAnd these are the functions Ive written to work with filep  precodevoid writeDisk      FILE file  fopendisk.dat, ab     fwriteampData, sizeofStudent, count, file     fclosefile   void loadDisk      FILE file  fopendisk.dat, rb     if file  NULL              freadampData, sizeofStudent, count, file         fclosefile               void emptyDisk       FILE file  fopendisk.dat, rw     fopendisk.dat, wb   codepre  pI can see that the size of my disk.dat file changes when I write to it, and it goes to zero when I call empty, but loading does not work at all. If the student array in my program is zero, it just stays at zero when I call load and try to display it, but if there is something in the array, I get a segmentation fault when I call load and then try to display it.  p  pI may be doing this entirely wrong. Im really not sure what Im doing. I was thinking that I could just write the whole array to a file, but Im not sure thats true. I was just wondering if someone could look at this and let me know where Im going wrong. p  pEDITp  pIve edited my code to look like thisp  precodevoid writeDisk      int i  0     FILE file  fopendisk.dat, ab      fori i ltcount i              fwriteData[i], sizeofStudent, 1, file             fclosefile   void loadDisk      char buffer[300]     int i  0      clearData      FILE file  fopendisk.dat, rb     whileData[i]  NULL      Data[i]  mallocsizeofStudent     freadData[i], sizeofStudent, 1, file     i       fclosefile         codepre  pThis still doesnt work though. The write seems to work better,but I dont see it writing the age of the student over to the file. The clearData function in the load file just clears anything thats in the Data array to begin with, so that we can have a clean slate to read the file into. p

Negative 3952 pN.B. I should note that the proper solution to this is to just use the placeholder attribute of an input, but the question still stands.p  pAnother N.B.  Since, as Quentin explains below, the value attribute stores the emdefaultem value, and the input.value IDL attribute stores the emcurrentem value, the JavaScript I used to fix the problem in my below example is nonconforming, as it uses the nonIDL value attribute to store current, rather than default, values.  Besides, it involves DOM access on every key press, so it was always just a flawed demo of the problem I was having.  Its actually quite terrible code and shouldnt be used ever.p  pCSS selectors made me think that I could make an input with a label that acts as a preview without any JS. I absolutely position the input at 0,0 inside the label which is displayed as an inlineblock and give it a background of none, but only if its got a value of  and isnt focussed, otherwise it has a background colour, which obscures the label text.p  pThe a hrefhttpdevelopers.whatwg.orgcommoninputelementattributes.htmlcommoninputelementapis relnofollowHTML5 spec says that input.value reflects the current value of an inputa, but even though input.value updates as you type into an input, CSS using the input[valuesomestring] selector applies based only on what was explicitly typed into the document, or set in the DOM by the JavaScript setAttribute method and perhaps by other DOMaltering means.p  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netMtzVD relnofollowI made a jsFiddle representing this.ap  pJust in case that is down, here is an HTML document containing the relevant codep  precodeltdoctype htmlgt     ltheadgt         ltmeta charsetutf8 gt         lttitlegtThe CSS Attribute selector behaves all funnylttitlegt          ltstylegt             label                  display inlineblock                 height 25px                 lineheight 25px                 position relative                 textindent 5px                 minwidth 120px                          label input[value]                  background none                          label input, label inputfocus                  background fff                 border 1px solid 666                 height 23px                 left 0px                 padding 0px                 position absolute                 textindent 5px                 width 100                      ltstylegt     ltheadgt     ltbodygt         ltform methodpostgt             ltpgtltlabelgtname ltinput required valuegtltlabelgtltpgt         ltformgt         ltpgtltbutton idjsfixThisgtJS PLEASE MAKE IT BETTERltbuttongtltpgt         ltscriptgt             var inputs  document.getElementsByTagNameinput             var jsFixOn  false             for i  0 i lt inputs.length i                  if inputs[i].parentNode.tagName  LABEL  only inputs inside a label counts as preview inputs according to my CSS                     var input  inputs[i]                     inputs[i].onkeyup function                           if jsFixOn input.setAttributevalue, input.value                                                                 document.getElementByIdjsfixThis.onclick  function                   if jsFixOn                      this.innerHTML  JS PLEASE MAKE IT BETTER                     jsFixOn  false                  else                      this.innerHTML  No, actually, break it again for a moment.                            jsFixOn  true                                       ltscriptgt     ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pI could be missing something, but I dont know what.p

Negative 3952 pWhen implementing a Onion architecture in ASP.NET MVC, it is my understanding that we a hrefhttponionarch.codeplex.comSourceControlchangesetviewe0ddb728120bsrcCoreDomainIDataContext.cs relnofollowshouldcould expose the IDataContext interfacea, which can be injected and referred to in the UI.p  pSo basically in ASP.NET MVC, we could dop  precodecontext.Products.AddmyBadProduct codepre  pDoesnt that allow the UI layer to implement business logic I believe that one of the basic philosophies of Onion is that it provides clear understanding what code goes into what layer and explicitly forbids the UI layer from implementing business logic.p  pIf we are exposing the storage to the UI with, or without codeSaveChangescode capability, we let the UI developers implement custom business logic.p  pThis can be fixed, by exposing all operations to the underlying IDataContext, via a Domain Service a hrefhttponionarch.codeplex.comSourceControlchangesetviewe0ddb728120bsrcCoreServicesImplShoppingCartProcessor.cs relnofollowsuch as thisa only.p  pstrongTo summarize my question into one sentencestrongp  pShould we allow the UI layer to touch the IDataContext or should we expose all our context operations only via a Domain Service If we expose the IDataContext, is it also ok to expose SaveChanges method, defined in IDataContext and implemented for example in the actual EfDataContextp  pI think the IDataContext should be exposed as readonly i.e. without SaveChanges capability, for querying purposes, while the CUD methods should be exposed as Domain Services.

Negative 3952 pIve been using Java 7s ZipFS support.p  pa hrefhttpsgist.github.comstain5591420 relnofollowhttpsgist.github.comstain5591420ap  pshows the behaviour, which I find a bit odd. Basically you can create a ZIP file system, make a file with a given name, and then also make a folder with the same name.p  pThe reason for this seems to be that internally the folder gets  appended to its name  however this new name is not returned, therefore you end up in a strange situation where Files.isDirectory returns false immediately after a successful Files.createDirectory.p  precodetry FileSystem fs  tempZipFS          Path folder  fs.getPathfolder         Files.createFilefolder         assertTrueFiles.isRegularFilefolder         assertFalseFiles.isDirectoryfolder          try              Files.createDirectoryfolder          catch FileAlreadyExistsException ex                                Is not thrown                    but a second createDirectory fails correctly         try              Files.createDirectoryfolder          catch FileAlreadyExistsException ex                                    Look, its both a file and folder          Path child  folder.resolvechild         Files.createFilechild           Can this be tested         assertTrueFiles.isRegularFilefolder          Yes, if you include the final          assertTrueFiles.isDirectoryfs.getPathfolder          But not the parent           assertTrueFiles.isDirectorychild.getParent          Or the original Path           assertTrueFiles.isDirectoryfolder      codepre  pSo as long as you have the  as the suffix, you can even work with both, and thats how they are listed if you do a directory listing of the root. p  pNow the ZIP format itself allows this as it only deals with entries in a ZIP file even allowing multiple entries with the same name, however normal use of a FileSystem would normally not allow multiple entries with the same name  as can be seen when I try to create the folder twice.p  pThe produced ZIP file can be browsed correctly with infozip, 7Zip and Windows 8 but trying to unzip will obviously fail because the native file system dont support such duality.p  pSo is this a feature, bug or something in betweenp

Negative 3952 pI have a custom control BedGrid that contains a collection of custom controls, each of which has a click handler on them.  In the PageLoad event of my Parent page, I generate a collection of BedGrids, and wire them up to an event handler.  This all works fine, when I generate the BedGrids on each PageLoad...  The grandchild is clicked, fires the event up to the BedGrid, which alerts my Parent Page and everything goes as planned.p  pThe problem is, its slow..  Generating all those custom controls on each PageLoad doesnt make sense especially with trips to the backend.  So, I want to cache the collection of BedGrids like sop  precodeprotected void PageLoadobject sender, EventArgs e      DrawBedGrids   protected void DrawBedGrids         if CachedBedgrids  null              CachedBedgrids  new ListltBedGridgt          Hit DB here and generate list of buildings....          foreach Building b in buildings                      BedGrid bg  new BedGridb             bg.RaiseAlertParentPage  new EventHandlerBedGridClicked             CachedBedgrids.Addbg                   else              foreach BedGrid bg in CachedBedgrids                      somePanel.Controls.Addbg                 protected ListltBedGridgt CachedBedgrids      get              try  return ListltBedGridgtSession[CachedBedgrids]          catch  return null           set  Session[CachedBedgrids]  value   codepre  pAnd it all breaks..

Negative 3952 pThis question is asked in my effort to understand interface in JavaC. As my programmer friend told me, interface is one of the easiest concept to understand but very hard to use effectively. Anybody looking to downvote, please consider guiding me in right direction before downvoting which I dont mind, provided I get the knowledge I seek for.p  pI understand how the interface works but its use seems little vague to me.p  pConsider thisp  precodepublic interface Drawable  public void drawGraphics g    public class Line implements Drawable  public void drawGraphics g  . . .  do somethingpresumably, draw a line  . . .  other methods and variables  codepre  pNow, to do something with this I still have to dop  precodeDrawable newObject new line codepre  pI have a Drawable type but I still need to create new object of the class, line. This being said, correct me if I am wrong, I am still creating an object of class, line which means writing above code is not helping me to save any memory, if the above thing is done for memory optimization  I know it is related more to abstraction than memory.p  pMy question is If the class line has the method that is designated on the interface it implements, why cant I just do the followingp  precodepublic class Line      public void drawGraphics g      . . .  do somethingpresumably, draw a line          . . .  other methods and variables        line newObject new line codepre  pAfter all, interface does nothing other than creating a base type. My novice understanding would be the second one will not need the interface at all and reduce the code. p  pI can take the same approach and say the same thing for the abstract class also because you still have to provide the concrete subclass with overridden methods. My question there would be, why not declare and create the concrete object without the need of abstract class.p  pI am sure I am missing something here. What makes interface so useful For me, it is just adding more code when the actual thing is done by the actual class. Can anybody please care to explainp

Negative 3952 pIm not sure if this is a bug with the Swagger JavaScript or the generated Swagger JSON, but it seems that when I point SwaggerUI at a single resource i.e. resourceMyResource  vs. resources, the models dont seem to be parsed correctly.    When I view all the resources in one shot via the resources url, the Models appear correctly as both response classes and input body type parameters.  When I switch the url to a single resource, all the models disappear.   The names and descriptions of input parameters remain, as well as the overall method signature.   This doesnt seem to happen with the Swagger Petstore demo though granted, it is using a newer version of Swagger.   Is there anything I should be doing in terms of the Swagger related API attributes that would help with thisp  pEDIT  As a workaround, Im using the latest SwaggerUI which is based on the Swagger 1.2 spec, but Im not changing any of the ServiceStack.Api.Swagger code to support that against my service.  I had to force SwaggerUI to request the resources in JSON format by modifying swagger.js to add the Accept applicationjson, but once I did that, it seems to work when pointing to a single resource.  So, this could just be a matter of updating the embedded SwaggerUI in ServiceStack.API.Swagger to the latest version.p

Either that, or its just a hardcoded warning specifically for this class.p  pSecondly, it doesnt seem like good practice to just assume that the result will never be null.

Negative 3952 pIve developed a real antipathy for magic numbers and magic strings. Generally, I create constants with meaningful names and set the values there. This is not an atypical practice. But, Ive run into a situation that makes me wonder about my dogmap  pIm writing classes that reflect the components of a standard message string. IOW, a thirdparty service vendor requires a defined message with fields of various lengths. Trying to code defensively, I put string substrings in my gets. For examplep  precode        public string BrowserHeader          get                      return BrowserHeader.SubstringSTRINGSTART, STRINGMAX                  set                      BrowserHeader  value                codepre  pYou can see where I used integer constants in the getter. In this case STRINGSTART  0, and STRINGMAX  256. I also have STRING2, STRING16, STRING25, etc. It strikes me, however, that this isnt a good approach. If the vendor changes the length of a given field string, say from 128 to 256, I still have to search the solution for that field to change each instance. The alternative of using BROWSERHEADERLENGTH is distasteful because there are scores, if not hundreds, of these fields and given what Ive seen from this vendor, I wouldnt be surprised if they werent consistent in lengths for a given field. p  pSo, is this a case where integer constants arent such a bad thing Is there a better way to approach this p  pThanksp

Negative 3952 pIm writing a python script to keep my dotfiles up to date with a repository on GitHub.  It copies the dot files into a separate directory  codedotfilescode  so that my home directory is not a git repo.  Before copying the files, it does a codefilecmp.cmp fileInLocalRepo,fileInHomeDir code to see if the file has changed since it was last copied into the local repo.  Once all the files are updated, if there have been any changes the changed files are pushed to GitHub.p  pThat works fine until I start updating dot files from more than one computer, then older files could potentially overwrite my remote ones.  If I pull the files down to my local codedotfilescode repo first, codefilecmp.cmpcode will still say the files are different and the script will overwrite the pulled down file with the local one, then push because it thinks there was a change.p  pIs there any way I can figure out which file is actually newer  I know that git doesnt preserve update times in file properties, so I cant use that.  How can I pull down files from GiHut to a local repo  codedotfilescode  then compare them with the same dot files that are in my home directory to see which of each file is actually newerp

Negative 3952 pI am writing a build script which has some password protected files keys. I need a way to prompt the user once for the password and then use this key across multiple scripts. These scripts do not live inside the same shell, and may spawn other windows via dbus. I can then send them commands, one of which must have access to the password.p  pI have this working already, but at a few points the passphrase is either used directly on a commandline passed via dbus, or is put into a file the name then passed to the other script. Both of these are less secure than I want. The commandline ends up in a history which may be stored in a file, as well as appearing in the process list, and the second option stores in a file which can be read by somebody else.p  pIs there some standard way to create a temporary communications channel between two processes which could communicate the password and not be intercepted by another user on the system including rootp  pemNote This is primarily an exercise to be fully secure. For my current project the temporary infile storage of the password is okay.emp

But there is never a check next to the menu item.  When I look at the menu item object while debugging, I do see the state value set to 0 and 1 before I toggle it.p  pAny suggestions as to what I am missingp

Negative 3952 pI need to retrieve a list of all triggers in a Quartz.NET database so I can list information about them in a table. I want all triggers, regardless of whether theyre running, waiting, acquired, or whatever. Im only using a single scheduler name and a single group, so in my case this is basically a simple matter of doing codeSELECT  FROM QRTZTRIGGERScode not entirely true because I also need information from the codeQRTZCRONTRIGGERScode table, but Id rather go through the API.p  pCurrently Im going through all known job types and calling codeGetTriggersOfJobcode for each one, as Ive seen recommended in a couple of places on the internet. My real code is more complex than this, but this is the gist of itp  precodevar allJobKeys  a list of all known jobs var scheduler  a new scheduler object var allTriggers  allJobKeys     .Selectscheduler.GetTriggersOfJob     .ToList codepre  pIs this really the only way to do it Its really inefficient I have about 30 different job types and counting, most of which are likely to have zero triggers associated with them at any given time. But this will require 30 database queries every time, instead of a single query that retrieves all of them.p  pNote that the scheduler Im retrieving the triggers in is used solely for that purpose as well as for creatingupdatingdeleting triggers, and will never be used to execute jobs. I ensure that by never calling codescheduler.Startcode on it.p  pFrom what I can tell theres no codegetAllTriggerscode in the original Quartz API in Java either, so Im assuming theres a reason why this doesnt exist, even though it seems like such a nobrainer. Is it do with concurrency handling when there are multiple scheduler hosts running in clustered mode or something like that It seems like something people would want to do fairly often.p

It seems to me that AutoLayout understanding is critical to speeding up development.  However, Im not finding a lot of information for using AutoLayout with pure C in Visual Studio 2013.  Perhaps Im just not looking in the right places.p  pAnyway, Lets start this new discussion with a simple controller that uses AutoLayout TOTALLY in C without using any .nib or Interface Builder stuff at all.  And without using Xamarin Studio.  Just ALL done in Visual Studio 2013.p  pHere are the requirementsp  ol liMake a UIViewController that will facilitate implementation of apples iAD.li liBasically, we want to place an iAD banner at the bottom of the screen taking up the full width.li liWe will put the view above the iAD banner and have it fill the rest of the screen.li liThe banner view may disappear from time to time if no ADs are present, so we need to handle that.li liWe need to handle when the device rotates to accommodate new orientation.li lipWe need to handle different devices.  iPod, iPad, iPhone, version 4 and 5p  pThis should be trivial, but Ive been banging my head on the keyboard for 2 days trying to get this to work.  Any recommendations, examples, or ideas would be GREATLY HELPFUL.  Remember, we want to ONLY use C in Visual Studio and not use Interface Builder at all.  Here is my non working attemptpli ol  pUsing the code below, I end up with the AdBanner off of the screen below the InternalView.  Also, the Internal View is longer than the screen and only half the screen width.

Negative 3952 pEssentially codepfcncstwinsrvstatusbar.ofcreatedwobjectcode generates a datawindow definition in codelsdwdefinitioncode, then uses that to create a datawindow. Im testing this using the PFC Example app, with the latest 12.5 Classic PFC pbls. This works in PB Classic 12.5.2 Build 5006. Migrated that app to PB .net 12.5.2 Build 5006. This does not work in PB .net. When generating the datawindow definition in codelsdwdefinitioncode, PB .net inserts codecode escape characters in front of all double quotes embedded in codelsdwdefinitioncode. The subsequent creation of the datawindow fails see error following I assume because the codecode escape characters are not recognized as valid dw syntax.

The issue is in the checkFit function.  I randomly generate a coordinate block on the board I check if the placement block can support the word or if it goes outside of scope.  If it goes outside of scope I randomly generate a new coordinate and call the same function again.  It is at that point that the error occurs.  Sadly, yes there is a lot of recursion because the random numberscoordinates generated could be anything that puts the code outside of scope.  I try to clear the array every time it goes out of scope.  Would just simply accessing the array at all cause this error The only place of error is lines 133182 which is the checkFit function.  Almost everything else functions as intended.  I still have more to add to solidify it but currently this error has me stumped.  Im not sure why it is happening.

However, though I can write to files, it would be much better for me if I could return this to codestdoutcode so that it can be piped into a filtering utility I have.p  pWhat are the alternatives to codeechocode I have tried replacing the last line in the script with all of the following without successp  precodeecho E avrohdfs concat DIRS  avrohdfs concat DIRS  avrohdfs concat DIRS  cat avrohdfs concat DIRS  trap avrohdfs concat DIRS  0 sort of works, but data misses the gttmp.avro and spits into the termal codepre  pI have checked the PATH variable, it is the same in my terminal and in the shell script.

What I really want is to get JDBC codeConnectioncode object from codeSQLExceptioncode object so I can rollback connection inside exception mapper.

I close connection after I finish each phase and open it at the beginning of next phase. So inside one request I do multiple openclose. Is this bad patternp

Negative 3952 pIm learning about xib files and just starting to understand why people use them as well as or instead of storyboards. My question is about how and when its appropriate to use the xib as a template. p  pLets say I have a xib mapped to my custom UIView subclass  I know how to set that up in IB  and my xib has a UILabel subview.  This is a very simplified example just for the purposes of the question, but basically Im trying to create a view that can be reused for each screen of an iOS introduction walkthru, like the panels of a hrefhttpsgithub.comMatthewYorkMYBlurIntroductionView relnofollowhttpsgithub.comMatthewYorkMYBlurIntroductionViewap  pSo I want to set most of whats in the view up at design time, and most of it will be common to each instance. The text I want to put in the UILabel is going to be static i.e. I know it now at designtime but each instance of the view will have different text. So lets say that I want to position the UILabel in different places in each instance, depending on how much text is in it etc and whether its covering something else important.  Now, I know I could do this programmatically, i.e. have the label as a property linked up in IB and then set frame position in the code, but as far as I understand it the beauty of using xibs is that you can do known things like this at designtime.p  pAs far as I can see my options arep  ol lipLoad new instances of the xib and set the position etc programmatically as mentioned above would rather not if possiblepli lipCreate my template xib, setting all the common stuff, and then make copies of it CustomView1.xib, CustomView2.xib, etc.  a bit yuck but not too badpli lipAfter creating my template xib, use the storyboard to drag in new UIViews and somehow set each to be linked to my one CustomView.xib, and then somehow do my static repositioning of the subview UILabel within each of those UIView instances on the storyboard.  Is that possible  If so thatd be great.  Obviously I know I can set each of those UIViews to be instances of my UIView subclass, but Im just missing the link between doing that and customising each instance.  Does the files owner have something to do with itpli ol

Negative 3952 pI am trying to run a service in the background, despite the lifecycle state of the Activity that creates it. To guarantee its running, the service in addition to the services it performs also has a thread that logs once a second. Finally, it also has logs in onStartCommand and onDestroy. p  pIm starting the service with startService and then I bind to it. My understanding is that this should keep the service running, regardless of what happens to its creator Activity. However, if the Activity is destroyed, the service stops logging. If the Activity is simply paused, there is no problem. p  pThe following is also true  1 onDestroy is never called on the service 2 I never call stopService or stopSelf after calling startServicep  pIm trying to figure out why the service is dying there are no exceptions or at the very least why its being paused and no longer logging.p

Negative 3952 pWe are very new to Azure, we have a large existing website multiple instances with different customers with an associated windows service and SQL Server 2008 database. p  pWe are in the process of migrating the website in development to Azure. We are creating an Azure worker role to wrap the code that the Windows service executes to run every hour but my main concern is deployment, in an ideal world we will automate the deployment but for now we want to get to the following point where we can build a single deployment package for a customer which runs the database migration scripts to the Azure SQL database and migrates the web role and site and during this time a holding page is displayed to let users know the site is currently being updated. Also it would be great if there was a way to rollback if something goes wrong.p  pDespite my research I cannot find the answer to the process above, everything seems to involve deploying the database changes this will include custom scripts for data migrationchanges and then publishing the site to Azure from visual studio but as we want to deploy this multiple times it would be ideal to build a package that we run against each customer sitedatabase when wethey are ready to migrate to the next version as this may not always happen at the same time.p  pOur current deployment strategy is a mess, we stop the application in IIS and then start another one which shows a holding page saying the site is being updated.  We then stop the windows service and manually copy the latest version overwriting the existing website and windows service.  We then run a SQL script which has any changes in on the database and then we restart the windows service and IIS application.p  pThis is not sustainable but in my research I have not come across the best option moving forward.  I have looked at MSBuild but it is completely new to me and finding somewhere to start with such unfamiliar technology is proving hard.  I also looked at FluentMigrator and considered running our database changes from applicationstart but I am not sure I am comfortable with that.p  pAs we are looking to move to Azure where we will have the site running with 5 different configurations at the moment we are looking at publishing profiles and the hosted build controller but I cannot figure out how to deploy the database with these changes.p  pI would appreciate some insight into how others handle deployments like this taking into account that we are using all the latest tech, VS2013, VSO, Azure, etc. and also that we need to be able to change the configurations for different customers and I am assuming publishing profiles is the best way to do that but I may be wrong.p

I read about Percelable but that couldnt be used for data storage maybe there is some alternative builtin or should i implement my own data serializer classes which could be pain in some point  Im open for any kind of suggestions, Thanks for your timep  pThis Question is not about SQLITE Slow insertation, its about slow Serialization.

Negative 3952 pAfter writing my application I started testing different scenarios. When I changed my theme background from dark to light from system settings, some of the controls in the pages changed color accordingly. As I am using ThemeResources that is a normal behavior but that made the pages quiet unusable as most of them were designed according to a dark background.p  pSo I started searching the net about themes in order to implement my own theme and fix the issue. Unfortunately I was unable to find a good solution after my research and stuck with some questions about creating custom themes for my application.p  pFirstly is there a way to override the system theme. For example even though user selects the light theme can I apply the dark theme in my application. I want to support system themes in the future but not in the beginning so being able to do that would ease my work greatly.p  pSecondly what is the best way of creating a new theme. While searching for a solution I read that copying a whole theme from generic.xaml and working on it with a new key is an easy solution. Is it OK to that, is it a good practicep  pLastly if I create multiple themes, say blue and red, is there a way to fetch these theme names programmatically using C.p  pAs always thanks for all your helps.p

Negative 3952 pWe have a requirement to read emails from an Office365 account and show them in our Java EE application. We have done it using JavaMail and its working as expected but the issue is with performance. Its taking around 30 secs to 3 minutes to read the emails depending on the size of mail or attachments. Is there any way we can improve this performance  Following are few more details of the approach we have taken.p  ol liWe are retrieving the mails using IMAPStoreli liThe emails that we need to read are not inside inbox. Its in a different folder outside of it. This folder again has subfolders which holds the filtered emails based on the subject.li liWhile reading the mails we read from a particular folder then show them in our application in the same hierarchy as they are present in the mail server.li ol  pWe thought of different alternative approaches like reading from a PST file or storing the emails into our database by a background process then reading from the DB but none of them really worked out.  Is there any other way of doing this. We found there is a Office365 SDK for android, can we make use of that p

Negative 3952 pWhat I am trying to achieve is integrate SonarQube analysis into the build process, so that whenever codemvn clean installcode is run, the code is analyzed with SonarQube. We want to use it for local analysis and also for build on Jenkins. If new issues are found, than the build should fail we want to use build breaker plugin for that. This way the developer would know that by his code his is going to introduce new issues, and will have to fix them for the build to work. p  pWhen I run codemvn sonarsonarcode, the analysis takes 30 seconds, which is OK. p  pHowever, the problem occurs when I am trying to bind codesonarcode goal to maven build phases. I bind codesonarcode to codeverifycode phase. The build takes strong5 minutesstrong now, which is too long. It should take about strong1 minutestrong. The build itself, without SonarQube analysis takes 30 seconds.p  pstrongNotestrong may help to figure out what the problem is the project on which the build is run has multiple modules in it, and I guess that is the problem. It looks like codesonarsonarcode goal is executed multiple times, once for each submodule, and the strongwholestrong project is analyzed multiple times not only the submodules. So, we have 4 submodules, and the report is generated 5 times during the build.p  pInstead, we want to analyze the whole project only once, not 5 times. Its also important for this 1 analysis to be run at the end of the build, after the strongcoberturastrong reports are generated for all modules.p  pSo, how do I integrate SonarQube analysis into the build, so that it analyzes my multimodule project only once, in the end, after cobertura reports are generated for all the submodulesp  pstrongSonarQube plugin properties in parent pomstrongp  precodelt Sonar plugin properties gt ltsonar.jdbc.urlgtjdbcurlltsonar.jdbc.urlgt ltsonar.analysis.modegtpreviewltsonar.analysis.modegt ltsonar.issuesReport.html.enablegttrueltsonar.issuesReport.html.enablegt        ltsonar.issuesReport.console.enablegttrueltsonar.issuesReport.console.enablegt ltsonar.host.urlgtsonar.host9000ltsonar.host.urlgt ltsonar.languagegtjavaltsonar.languagegt ltsonar.buildbreaker.skipgtfalseltsonar.buildbreaker.skipgt ltsonar.qualitygategtSonar20way20with20Findbugsltsonar.qualitygategt ltsonar.preview.includePluginsgtbuildbreakerltsonar.preview.includePluginsgt ltsonar.exclusionsgtfiletargetltsonar.exclusionsgt ltbranchgtdevelopmentltbranchgt codepre  pstrongPlugins configuration in the project pomstrongp  precode                lt Run cobertura analysis during package phase gt                 ltplugingt                     ltgroupIdgtorg.codehaus.mojoltgroupIdgt                     ltartifactIdgtcoberturamavenpluginltartifactIdgt                     ltexecutionsgt                         ltexecutiongt                            ltphasegtpackageltphasegt                               ltgoalsgt                                  ltgoalgtcoberturaltgoalgt                                ltgoalsgt                         ltexecutiongt                   ltexecutionsgt                 ltplugingt                  lt Run sonar analysis preview mode during verify phase.

Negative 3952 pI have an object that only initializes itself with barebones data when constructed fast, and loads itself for real slow when first accessed. The idea is that Im creating a lot of these barebones objects at startup and hash them into a map, then fully load each object whenever it is individually accessed for the first time. The problem is that I cannot guarantee how clients will interact with this object, there are multiple public methods that might be invoked.p  pIs there a good pattern to support this kind of situation The obvious and my current solution is to track state with an internal bool, check against that bool in every function that might be invoked, and load that way. But that requires code duplication of that behavior across all public functions, and is vulnerable to errors. p  pI can imagine a single pointofentry method that then dishes out behaviors based on a client request type etc., but before I go consider going down that road I want to see if theres a commonly accepted approachpattern that I might not be aware of. Im doing this in C, but any insight is appreciated.p

Null and empty out everything map related before initializing the map. Console log how many times the initialization code gets called per page load once btw If map initialization code is called more than once, return before anything is done on second and subsequent calls dont happen but still a safeguard.p  pAnyone experience something similar  It literally looks like the map is being initialized twice within the same container.p

Negative 3952 pI did a production release for one of my clients with Azure PAAS  Azure Web App formerly Azure Websites. We marked the site in Auto scale mode with 2 minimum instances. We started getting complains from the users that intermittently users are experiencing some issues which can cause only if they lose the session variables while actively using the site. p  pWe were wondering how that can happen since we are maintaining the sessions in in proc. We didnt go for a separate out of proc session manager Redis cache  DB based on the day 1 because, according to the documentation, Azure Web app runs with a sticky session load balancer when running with multiple instances by default. It injects ARR affinity cookie in the Http response that helps in redirecting a user to the same instance with which it established the session at the first time. p  pTo debug this issue, we started printing the actual sessionId in the page. After many attempts, we reproduced the issue  surprisingly sessions are getting swapped. Lets say  my session Id is 1eocgtmwwwwvs1cxksyofne4, after the page refreshes it got changed to 5p1hsxszq2mcqmt5i5ytqg12 including all other information that are managed in session variable. Scary isnt itp  pReached out to support with an Emergency ticket  the response is  p  pAzure Web Apps is a stateless platform and our recommendations is to implement a Session Management solution that best works for your environment and avoid the dependency on Inmemory session state management especially in cases where your Web App is hosted on multiple servers . In your case as you are considering to implement a Caching solution for session management in near future , our recommendation is to move to a single instance as a workaround for now . We will assist you in ensuring that the app is working as expected on a single instance.p  pI completely understand that  but why Affinity cookie will fail. I know that Affinity cookie can be disabled and I didnt disable it. I thought of sharing this story. It could be useful for any other person relying on Affinity cookie based sticky load balancer.p  pBTW Redis session provider implementation is very easy. It took just a few mins to implement.p  pDoing a postmortem now  what went wrong I didnt consider the cookie not supported browsers. Then why would it fail intermittently even in my browser where I support cookie. PAAS resources are constantly in move  getting swapped .. .. and there is no way we can use in proc session  etcp

Mills has talked his reluctant wife, Tracy Gwyneth Paltrow, into moving to the big city so that he can tackle important cases, but his first and Somersets last are more than either man has bargained for. A diabolical serial killer is staging grisly murders, choosing victims representing the seven deadly sins. Somerset initially refuses to take the case, realizing that there will be five more murders, ghastly sermons about lust, sloth, pride, wrath, and envy presented by a madman to a sinful world. But something within him cannot let the case go, forcing the weary detective to team with Mills and see the case to its almost unspeakably horrible conclusion.ltpgtltsynopsisgt ltmoviegt ltmovie namethegamegt     lttitlegtThe Gamelttitlegt     ltquotegtfoobarltquotegt     ltshowinggtfoobarltshowinggt     ltratinggtfoobarltratinggt     ltyeargtfoobarltyeargt     ltlengthgtfoobarltlengthgt     ltgenregtfoobarltgenregt     ltstaring1gtfoobarltstaring1gt     ltstaring2gtfoobarltstaring2gt     ltstaring3gtfoobarltstaring3gt     ltstaring4gtfoobarltstaring4gt     ltslogangtfoobarltslogangt     ltsynopsisgtfoobarltsynopsisgt ltmoviegt ltmoviesgt codepre  pSo, when clicking on the movie poster for se7en, I would need to find the movie object with a name of se7en in the xml document.

Negative 3952 pI have a requirement where I need to take a copy of some of my files and put that to the internal server. This need to happen periodically, something like at 8 PM every day. This is a strongSwingstrong application as well, running in my local PC. I know I can schedule a task using Java, either by using codejava.util.Timecode, codeJodaTimecode or even better codeQuartz Schedulercode.p  pBut, here comes the issue. No one is going to keep the computer turn on for 24 hours just for this scheduler. And as far as I know, if someone restarted the PC, the Java schedulers will die too. Instead once the task is scheduled, if the computer is turned on, the scheduled task should happen everyday at 8PM without a human interaction. That means, no need to restart the application again and reschedule.p  pThis feature I described is very common, can be seen in all the Virus guards, windows based alarms etc. But how can I achieve the same in Java For the moment if I have to use a windows specific solution like using codeJNIcode or some hack with batch files etc I am using windows, that is also fine.p  pAt least is this is possible with javap

Negative 3952 pI am using GreasemonkeyTampermonkey to visit pages and make a change to a 100element table based on whats on the current page.p  pShort term storage and array manipulation works fine, but I want to store the data permanently.  I have tried GMgetValueGMsetValue, GMSuperValue, localStorage, and indexedDB, but I am clearly missing something fundamental.  Nothing seems to allow me to write the array into the permanent storage and then read it back into a variable where I can access each element, such that variablename[32] is actually the 32nd element in the table.  Well, 33rd if you start counting at zero, which I do.p  pI need access to the entire 100element table while the script is running, because I need to output some or all of it on the page itself.  In the most basic case, I have a for loop which goes from 0 to 99, printing out the value of variablename[i] each time.p  pI have no predisposition to any method, I just want the frickin thing to work in a GreasemonkeyTampermonkey script.p  pTowards the top of the script I have thisp  precodefor var i0 ilt99 i      currentData[i]  localStorage.getItemcurrentData[i]  codepre  pThe purpose of the above section is to read the 100 entries into the currentData array.

Negative 3952 pSo I only very recently started with the concept of Vue or React, JS libraries that are the view layer of your app. Now I started building a tiny little test app with Vue that has video lists, theyre simply lists of videos. However, every video list has a different source from my own JSON API, so one list might request apiv1related related videos for video with ID 1 and one might be a general apivpopular for the most popular videos.p  pNow all these lists have the same HTML markup, it looks something like thisp  precodeltul classvideolist iduniqueIdentifiervideolistgt     ltli vrepeatvideos classrowgt         lta href classimagewrappergt             ltdiv stylebackground url thumbnail center backgroundsize covergtltdivgt         ltagt         ltdiv classinfowrappergt             lth4gt                 lta hrefgt title ltagt                 ltsmallgt length ltsmallgt             lth4gt             ltp classvideodescriptiongt desc ltpgt         ltdivgt     ltligt ltulgt codepre  pYou can see me implementing Vue with  repeat, the videos are coming dynamically from a backend. You can see me grabbing the thumbnail, title, length and the description. I created a bunch of dummy videos that are returned by the API, an example video response looks like this in JSONp  precode   title Cool example video,   desc This video is about very interesting things and such,   length 025,   thumbnail httpsunsplash.it1280720image50  codepre  pThe HTML markup is the same on every page, so thats one point of repetitioncode duplication, but the much mroe important one are the Vue instances.p  pSo for each of these lists I have mostly the same behavior, the list is a Vue instance that is bound to the unique ID and it fetches the videos using vueresource, puts them in the videos property and that powers the list. It looks like thisp  precodevar uniqueVideoList  new Vue     el uniqueIdentifiervideolist,      data          videos []     ,      ready function          this.fetchVideos     ,      methods          fetchVideos function              this.http.getapivpopular, functionvideos                  this.videos  videos                             codepre  pPretty much this exact code, the Vue instance, I have copied for each and every video list on the site. So I have the HTML markup and JavaScript copied for every instance, the HTML is the exact same and the JS is apart from the single endpoint it needs to hit.p  pWhat could I do to fix this Thanks.p

Negative 3952 pThere exists a game, whose state is quantified by codencode boolean variables codep1code, codep2code, ..., codepncode. Assume code0 lt n lt 10code. The purpose of the game is to keep track of the state of as many variables as possible, and when they will change states see below.p  pOnly a subset of the variables may be observed at a time. We are always informed when the state of a variable changes from codetruecode to codefalsecode, but only when the variable in question is being observed are we also informed which variable was changed.p  pIf some codepicode changes state from codetruecode to codefalsecode at time codetcode, then it will change state back from codefalsecode to codetruecode at time codet  60code.p  pHere are some example situations and the desired behavior. Assume that there are three variables, codep1code, codep2code, and codep3code.p  ul liAll variables are observable. A variable changes state and by observation it is codep1code. We know that codep1code will change state back at codet  60code.li licodep1code and codep2code are observable. A variable changes state. It should be inferred that it was codep3code. We know that codep3code will change state back at codet  60code.li licodep1code is observable, and it is known that codep2code changed state to codefalsecode at time codet  30code. A variable changes state. It was not codep1code by observation and codep2code will only change state to codetruecode at codet  30code, therefore it was codep3code.li liNo variables are observable It is known that codep1code changed state to codefalsecode at time codet  30code, codep2code changed state to codefalsecode at codet  75code, and codep3code changed state to false at codet  80code. A variable changes state. At codet  1code codep2code is observed to have a value of codetruecode. Because codep1code is still codefalsecode, and codep2code has been observed to be codetruecode, it should be inferred that codep3code is codefalsecode, and will change state back to codetruecode at codet  60code.li licodep1code and codep2code are observable. It is known that codep3code changed state to codefalsecode at time codet  70code. No variable changes state. It should be inferred that codep3code is true, since it would have changed from codefalsecode to codetruecode at codet  10code, and if it had changed from codetruecode to codefalsecode, we would have been informed of a variable changing state.li ul  pOne approach I have tried involved iterating over each of the variables on each notification of a variable state change, and ruling out the possible matches based onp  ul liwhether it was visible and had not changed stateli liwhether its last state change is known and not far enough in the past for it to have changed back.li ul  pthen, for the leftover variables for which state is known, determining an upper and lower bound on their last variable change based on when the variable was last observed in a particular state, when the variable may have changed state back, from codefalsecode to codetruecode, etc. Then if there exists only one variable change event within that bounds, it should be the one corresponding to the variable. It ended up being too cumbersome and I didnt continue. Every line was a burden because it seemed as if the number of possible combinations of states was too large and I would not take something into account.p  pIs the above approach a reasonable one to take, given the problem statement Is there a general way that problems like this are modeled that allows them to be solved more elegantlyp

If I open the modal for editing the book author, and just close it, without editing the author  there is no problem.p  pBut if I open the modal, and type something in the author input, and close it, the model is stuck with the current input value for the whole time, so if I open another author for editing, the model will not be updated.p  pMy question is why is this happening, and how to fix it p  pHTMLp  precodeltdiv ngcontrollerMyCtrlgt     lttable classtable tablehovergt             lttrgt                               lttdgtltbgtPublisherltbgtlttdgt                                 lttdgtltbgtEdit Publisherltbgtlttdgt             lttrgt             lttr ngrepeatbook in booksgt                 lttdgt                     book.Author                 lttdgt                  lttdgt                     ltspan ngclicktoggleModalbook classbtn btnprimarygtEditltspangt                 lttdgt             lttrgt         lttablegt      ltmodaldialog infomodalShown showmodalShown width600px height60gt         ltdiv ngshowdivBookgt               ltinput typetext namebookAuthor ngmodelbookAuthor gt         ltdivgt     ltmodaldialoggt ltdivgt codepre  pAngularp  precodevar myApp  angular.modulemyApp,[]  myApp.controllerMyCtrl, functionscope     scope.books  [AuthorJon Skeet,AuthorJohn Papa,AuthorScott Hanselman]      scope.modalShown  false      scope.toggleModal  function book            scope.bookAuthor  book.Author           scope.modalShown  scope.modalShown           scope.divBook  true            myApp.directivemodalDialog, function       return          restrict E,         template ltdiv  classngmodal ngshowshowgt                     ltdiv classngmodaloverlay ngclickhideModalgt                      ltdivgt                       ltdiv classngmodaldialog ngstyledialogStylegt                       ltdiv classngmodalclose ngclickhideModalgtXltdivgt                       ltdiv classngmodaldialogcontent ngtranscludegt                      ltdivgt                     ltdivgt                 divgt,         replace true,         scope              show info         ,         transclude true,         link function scope, element, attrs               scope.apply             scope.dialogStyle               if attrs.width                 scope.dialogStyle.width  attrs.width             if attrs.height                 scope.dialogStyle.height  attrs.height             scope.hideModal  function                   scope.show  false                             codepre  pSo, the test case will bep  pClick Edit  change the value  close the modalp  pClick Edit on another author.p  pstrongJSFiddlestrong a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netHB7LU17694 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netHB7LU17694ap

Negative 3952 pI have subclassed UIWebView to add custom UIMenuController functionality in and it was working pretty well up until iOS 9. I am not sure what has changed, but now I am running into a situation where when I tap on a link, that should present the menu, the menu shows up briefly, but is dismissed with no more tapping from me.p  pI am having a hard time figuring out where that dismissal is originating from. I am observing the codeUIMenuControllerDidHideMenuNotificationcode notification, and that is indeed being called right after the menu disappears, but I am having a hard time finding the cause of the dismissal.p  pI recognize that there are many different issues that could be lurking, but I am wondering if anyone has experienced something like this before Is there a way to track somehow the cause of the dismissalp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comGDf8o.gif relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comGDf8o.gif altenter image description hereap

Negative 3952 pI know that questions having codecodecode is most relevant here at SO. However I have a question which is more related to APIWeb service. I read the recommendation and so I am asking this based on the guidelines mentioned in it. p  pWe are building an online image asset management application is a mashup app, that allows customers to store data in the cloud and sharetransfer between multiple drive services like GDrive, Amazon Cloud, Flick etc. It also allows for minimal curation and corrections.p  pSince many of our customers will be our service as a lowcost bulk storage system specially aligned for image assets, we provide them various ways of grouping images. Currently it includes exif dates and filenames. We are adding geotags to it. One feature we are really interested in, is having images grouped based on codesimilaritycode. We are looking at APIs or services that can either be paid or free to which we can feed a bunch of images and we get recommendations based on similarity. p  pI have been checking online but I do not see any established service provider out there. The a hrefhttpswww.ltutech.cominactiononlineapplications relnofollowLTU enginea is mostly for ecommerce search such as similar dresses etc. Most others I found were for copyright infringement and brand detection services. There is an a hrefhttpejohn.orgblogimagesimilaritysearchwanted relnofollowarticlea from John Resign,who was searching for the same thing way back in 2012, but based on the comments I do not think he found anything good. p  pMy scenario is something like this  say a customer has a thousand images uploaded  some from the beach, some of his family and some other random. I would like the three categories of grouping to be the same as above more or less.p  pDoes anyone have experience in this kind of domain Any pointers are greatly appreciated.p

Negative 3952 pI am using Parse as the backend for an app Im working on. I was wondering if there is an optimal algorithm to query for only unseen new objects. p  pWhat I am planning on doing is something like adding a user to the viewed objects relation and later querying all objects to check for the absence of the user. This seems to be On all users who have seen an n complexity which is a bit too much.p  pAnother way to do this is to add the object to a users key seen and to then query for all objects the user has not seen. p  pMaybe a much more efficient way could be assuming I view these objects chronologically is to mark the first and last objects I see, and only show ones before or after those points using the createdAt key. Then I guess to show new objects outward from those points to not have to divide into multiple queries.p  pIdeally Id like to shuffle through the objects, but I also would like to keep this algorithm as efficient as possible.p
