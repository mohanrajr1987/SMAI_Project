Positive 3737 pI have a custom form codeCreateAdminFormcode where an admin in the backend can create a new Admin user. I created my own form model so I can handle the passsword. They just fill out username, nicename, email, password, select the status active, banned, deleted, and choose a role Root, Super, Admin. They enter the password as normal, and the custom form encrypts it.  I have checks so Root can create anything, Super can only create regular Admins, and regular admins can not create any other admins at all.p  pI actually had this working on my last project, but I bypassed the codeisNewRecordcode because I created the forms in their respective view files create.php and update.php instead of them both using the same codeform.phpcode file. It isnt a big deal, but I would like to follow the way Yii does things and get the codeform.phpcode file handling the forms again, if possible.p  pSince I am now using my own model codeCreateAdminFormcode instead of codeAdmincode model which is a spin off of codeUsercode, it does not have access to codeisNewRecordcode.p  pHow can I get codeform.phpcode to use codeisNewRecordcode with my custom codeCreateAdminFormcode modelp  pTruncated CreateAdminFormp  precodeclass CreateAdminForm extends Model      public nicename     public username     public email     public password     public role     public status      public function createAdmin              if thisgtvalidate              admin  new Admin             admingtnicename  thisgtnicename             admingtusername  thisgtusername             admingtemail  thisgtemail             admingtrole  thisgtrole             admingtstatus  thisgtstatus             admingtsetPasswordthisgtpassword             admingtgenerateAuthKey             if admingtsave                  return admin                                return null       codepre  pform.php p  precodeltdiv classadminformgt      ltphp form  ActiveFormbegin gt      lt formgtfieldmodel, usernamegttextInput[maxlength gt true] gt      lt formgtfieldmodel, nicenamegttextInput[maxlength gt true] gt      lt formgtfieldmodel, emailgttextInput[maxlength gt true] gt      lt formgtfieldmodel, rolegtdropDownList         modelgtgetUserRoleDropdown,         [promptgt  Admin Role  ]      gt      lt formgtfieldmodel, statusgtdropDownList         modelgtgetUserStatusDropdown,         [promptgt  Admin Status  ]      gt      lt modelgtisNewRecord  HtmlaChange Password, [adminchangeadminpassword, id gt modelgtid] . ltbr gtltbr gt   gt      ltdiv classformgroupgt         lt HtmlsubmitButtonmodelgtisNewRecord  Create  Update, [class gt modelgtisNewRecord  btn btnsuccess  btn btnprimary] gt     ltdivgt      ltphp ActiveFormend gt  ltdivgt codepre

Negative 3737 pSUMMARY When browsing an ASP.NET website using Windows Explorer, popup windows do not borrow the session cookie from the parent window.p  pDETAILSp  pIm working on an ASP.NET website .NET 2.0. I use FormsAuthentication. It is a requirement to use cookies to handle the session.p  pOn a page I have a button. When the user clicks it, a popup window is opened. The popup displays an ASPX page that uses session variables, previously set from the parent browser window. Ive been testing the website using IE 6, 7, 8 and Firefox 2.0. On all these browsers, the popup window has access to the same session as the parent browser window and everything works ok.p  pI now have a bug raised by the client, stating that the popup window displays an error. Looking at the log file, I can see that it is a NullReferenceException at the moment the popup page tries to access the session variables. Talking with the client, he said that he opened the main website in Windows Explorer p  pIve managed to recreate the issue on a test machine and saw that the popup is using a new session.p  pThe machine must have Win XP an IE6 installed   With IE7 the website works ok.p

Negative 3737 pWe are upgrading a suite of data acquisition and analysis routines from VB6 programs to a mixture of VB.NET, VB6, and Matlab programs.  We want to keep the system modular separate EXEs so we can easily create specialized standalone analysis programs without having to constantly upgrade one massive application.  We have used MBInterProcess to send messages between EXEs when all the programs were written in VB6 and this worked perfectly for us e.g., to have the data acquisition EXE send the latest file name to a standalone data display program. Unfortunately, this ActiveX cannot be used within Matlab or VB.NET to receive messages.  We are wondering what is the simplest string message passing system pipes, registered messages, etc that we could adopt. Right now we are just polling to see if new file was written in a specific folder, which cant be the best solution. Our ideal solution would not require a huge investment in time learning nuances of Windows we are biologists, not fulltime programmers and would work in both WinXP and 64bit versions of Windows.p  pIn response to the queries, we have wrapped the entire Matlab session within a VB6 program that has the MBInterProcess ActiveX control.  That works but is not a great solution for us since it will probably lock us into WinXP forever and certainly will prevent us from using the 64bit version of Matlab. The latest version of Matlab 2009a can access .NET functions directly, so we assume one solution might be to use the .NET library to implement pipes or something similar across programs.  We would like to recreate the elegantly simple syntax of the MBInterProcess ActiveX and have a piece of code that listens for a message with that programs toplevel Windows name, and then call a specific Matlab mfile, or VB.NET function, with the string data e.g., file name as an argument.p

Negative 3737 pSo, heres the deal. Ive got two ASP.NET applications, both of which use SQLServer Session State management. They also both use the same server. Ive got a custom session class in an external DLL, which fully implements serialization, and which both applications have referenced. Each application, in turn, has a class which inherits from the DLL class, and both applications use their own respective classes for their session state.p  pNow, what I was trying to accomplish was that if you wanted to go to the other application, it could look in the session they all use the same session key and treat the existing object there as the base the one from the DLL, extract whatever login info you need, then overwrite the session object with your own. Unfortunately, when the second application attempts to read the session, it seems that it looks for the DLL of the first application, and when it cant find it, it throws an exception.p  pIs there a flaw in my logicp  pHeres an examplep  precode Global.asax of the 1st app   protected void SessionStartobject sender, EventArgs e          Session.Add           UserSessionKey,           new FirstUserSession  FirstUserSession inherits from BaseUserSession    codepre  pNow the second applicationp  precode Global.asax of 2nd app protected void SessionStartobject sender, EventArgs e      if Session[UserSessionKey]  null              BaseUserSession existing  BaseUserSessionSession[UserSessionKey]          SecondUserSession session  new SecondUserSession  This also inherits from BaseUserSession          session.Authenticated  existing.Authenticated         session.Id  existing.Id         session.Role  existing.Role          Session.AddUserSessionKey, session          else              Session.AddUserSessionKey, new SecondUserSession       codepre  pHeres the exception stack trace.

Negative 3737 pI am trying to build a mathematical model of the availability of a file in a distributed filesystem. I posted this question at MathOverflow but this might as well be classified as a CSquestion so I give it a shot here as well. p  pThe system works like this a node stores a file encoed using erasure codes at rb remotes nodes, where r is the replicationfactor and b is an integer constant. Erasurecoded files have the property that the file can be restored iff at least b of the remote nodes are available and return its part of the file.p  pThe simplest approach to this is to assume that all remote nodes are independent of each other and have the same availability p. With these assumptions the availability of a file follows the Binomial distribution, i.e. img srchttpbit.lydyJwwE altBinomial distributionp  pUnfortunately these two assumptions can introduce a nonneligible error, as shown by this paper a hrefhttpdeim.urv.catlluis.pamiesuploadsMainicpp09paper.pdfhttpdeim.urv.catlluis.pamiesuploadsMainicpp09paper.pdfa.p  pOne way to overcome the assumption that all nodes have the same availability is to calculate the probability of each possible combination of availaiblenonavailable node and take the sum of all these outcomes which is sort of what they suggest in the paper above, just more formally than what I just described. You can see this approach as a binary tree with depth rb and each leave is one possible combination of availablenotavailable nodes. The files availability is the same thing as the probablity that you arrive at a leave with b available nodes. This approach is more correct but has a computational cost of img srchttpbit.lycEZcAP altOrdo. Also, it doesnt deal with the assumption of node independence.p  pDo you guys have any ideas of a good approximation which introduces less error than the binomial distributionaproximation but with better computational cost than img srchttpbit.lycEZcAP althttpbit.lyd52MM9 p  pYou can assume that the availabilitydata of each node is a set of tuples consisting of codemeasurementdate, node measuring, node being measured, succesfailurebitcode. With this data you could for example calculate the correlation of the availability between the nodes and the availability variance.p

Negative 3737 pIve noticed while on my quest to lean functional programming that there are cases when parameter lists start to become excessive when using nested immutable data structures. This is because when making an update to an object state, you need to update all the parent nodes in the data structure as well. Note that here I take update to mean return a new immutable object with the appropriate change.p  pe.g. the kind of function I have found myself writing Clojure example isp  precodedefn updateobjectinworld [world country city building object property value]   updatecountryinworld world     updatecityincountry country       updatebuildingincity building         updateobjectinbuilding object property value  codepre  pAll this to update one simple property is pretty ugly, but in addition the caller has to assemble all the parametersp  pThis must be a fairly common requirement when dealing with immutable data structures in functional languages generally, so is there a good pattern or trick to avoid this that I should be using instead p
Negative 3737 pHi folks I have an in memory bounded queue in which multiple threads queue objects. Normally the queue should be emptied by a single reader thread that processes the items in the queue.p  pHowever, there is a possibility that the queue is filled up. In such a case I would like to persist any additional items on the disk that would be processed by another background reader thread that scans a directory for such files and processes the entries within the files. I am familiar with Active MQ but prefer a more light weight solution.

Negative 3737 pAs most of you know CPUs are not well designed to do floating point calculation in contrast to GPUs. I am wondering how to use GPUs power without any abstraction layer or driver. Can I program for a GPU using assembly, C, C language I mean how. Although assembly seems to help me access the gpu directly, CC are likely to need a medium library e.g. OpenCL to access the GPU.p  pLet me ask you another question How much of a modern GPUs capability will be exposed to a programmer without any thirdparty driverp

Negative 3737 pIve a general design questionbr  br  I have a mailserver, written in C.br  Then I have a web forum software, written in for ASP.NET in C.br  br  Now Id like to integrate the mailserver into the ASP.NET forum application. For example, Id like to make it possible that one can create a mailinglist from the forum, and give users the oportunity to add oneselfs to the mailinglist members in the forum, and then add the new listmembers to the respective mailinglist on the server.p  pSince the server is a separate consolewinformsservice application, I first thought Id best use .NET remoting for this.p  pBut my second thought was, that some users might host their forum on a host where br  a they dont have a virtual machine where they can do what they wantbr  b the admin of the host might not want to install an additional mailserver or charge extra for thisbr  c the user might have a service plan that only permits to add a webapplication, not external programs very likelybr  br br  Now, I wanted to askbr  Is it possible to fully integrate a mailserver into an ASP.NET application somehow  I have the full source of the server  ASP.NET applicationp  pWell, it probably wont be a page or a ashx handler, but something like a http module  Or whats the general way to integrate TCPIP applications into asp.net  Of course Im assuming the respecive ports are availableforwarded  and Ill make it possible to also run it with the email server as external applicationp

But in frontend you would normally want to manage objects related to signedin User, so you have to manually get the id of the User, pass id to the model and write a bunch of methods that would retrieve objects related to this User, for examplep  precode  public function executeIndexsfWebRequest request        thisgtarticles  DoctrinegetTableArticles       gtgetUserArticlesthisgtgetUser      public function executeShowsfWebRequest request        thisgtarticle  thisgtgetRoutegtgetObject      if thisgtarticlegtbelongsToUserthisgtgetUser            thisgtredirect404             codepre  pand modelp  precodeclass ArticleTable extends DoctrineTable      public function getUserArticlessfUser user            q  thisgtcreateQuerya         gtwherea.userid  , usergtgetId        return qgtexecute           class Article extends BaseArticle    public function belongsToUsersfUser user        return thisgtgetUserId  usergtgetId     codepre  pThis is trivial stuff and yet you have to manually write this code for each new relation. Am I missing some kind of way to take advantage of Doctrine relations Anyways, how would you do it Thank you.p
Negative 3737 pIm attempting to override an Android View class to tweak the functionality just slightly.  But I need to modify a field that does not have a setter method.  Ive placed the subclass in a package called codeandroid.widgetcode.  Why cant I access any of the packageprivate member fields  I notice that the compiler says they cannot be resolved, rather than not being accessible.  Does this have something to do with how Android.jar is builtp

Is there a clean method for avoiding the race condition in Entity Framework without resorting to stored procedures or blindly swallowing exceptions p
Negative 3737 pI used bind all codeGridViewscode, codeDetailViewscode etc. on my page using an codeObjectDataSourcecode unless it wasnt possible to do so. Recently, Ive started binding all my contols programatically. I find this a lot cleaner and easier, though some may disagree. p  pBinding with a codeObjectDataSourcecode obviously has it advantages and disadvantages, as does doing it programatically.p  pSay I bind a GridView programatically e.g. codeGridView1.DataSource  SomeListcode, when I change page on the GridView, I have to also code this. Each time the page changes I have to call codeGridView1.DataSource  SomeListcode again. Obviously with a codeObjectDataSourcecode I dont need to do this. I normally stick my codeSomeListcode object into the ViewState so when I change page I dont need to hit the database each and every time.p  pMy question is Is this how the ObjectDataSource works Does it store its data in the ViewState and not hit the database again unless you call the code.Selectcode method I like to try and get the best performance out of my applications and hit the database as few times as possible but I dont really like the idea of storing a huge list in the ViewState. Is there a better way of doing this Is caching per user a good idea or possible Shall I just hit the database everytime instead of storing my huge list in the ViewState Is it sometimes better to hit the database than to use ViewStatep

Negative 3737 pIm developing a site that sends email notifications to users after certain eventsuser actions tagged in a photo, added as a friend, etc.p  pFrom my experience, sending emails from a web server strongcan bestrong slow.

Negative 3737 pHow would you implement this app in JavaScript using principles of MVCp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comIWtAi.png altenter image description herep  pAs you can see, the app basically has 3 views Sidebar, Visualization amp Timeslider. The underlying model must keep track of selected countries and year. p  pWhen initing the app, it should load a json file that populates the model with data. With some sort of event system please advice, the controller should be notified of a stable model, and corresponding views should be set.p  pFor example, adding a country in the sidebar should trigger data reload, followed by updating of xy scales of the visualization view to accomodate for more countries etc.p  pHow would you separate the logic from the views what would go in the model, view amp controller respectively and what libraries would you use especially re. event handling.p  pCode is much appreciated ...

Negative 3737 pI have an application thats behaving as a server in a way. I have some consumers another application which send tasks to the server application and get something as a result. The application is implemented in Java as a console application. The problem is that I need to measure the performance of the application CPU, memory, throughput if possible and anything else I could get. If I keep my server as a console application, I get a problem of application level measuring, which can be extremely hard. My idea was to upgrade the console application to a web service, i.e., to create some kind of a wrapper so to be able to call the server as a web application. I guess that the monitoring part would be much easier then.p  pId like to hear your thoughts about it. Is that a good idea Can I get better results if I upgrade it to a web service And how do I even do that At this point I just want to get some results, the code can be dirty. The application is originally imagined as a web service or something similar, the console application is just a simulation, so creating a web service instead of a console application is not a terrible thing to do.p

The application list my friends and which city they are from in an NSTableView.  In this table view I would like to have the City column be an NSComboBoxCell with a list of the cities.  I got this far... now for the problem brbr When I select the city from the combo box, the application takes the value of the selected city name and applies it to the name of the city the friend is currently from.  Instead, I would like the application to actually change the city the user is from and not the name of the city...  Thats a bit confusing of a question, so heres an example starting with a list of friends likep  pre Andy      Asheville Francois  Montreal Jeff      Asheville pre  pIf I use the NSComboBoxCell to change the city for Andy from Asheville to Montreal, the application actually changes the name of the City Asheville to Montreal, so the result looks likep  pre Andy      Montreal Francois  Montreal Jeff      Montreal pre  pThere are still two distinct cities in the application, but they now both have the name Montreal. brbr This all makes sense to me given the way I set up my bindings.  I bound the value of the city table column by setting Model Key Path to city.name and the Controller Key to arrangedObjects, which contains the list of friends.  So of course, when the value of a cell changes it modifies city.name.  So then my question becomes whats the proper way to do this so that the city changes instead of the city namep

Negative 3737 pIm familiar with Java but am just starting out Android programming, and dont really know what I need to make things happen. Im trying to work with a Canvas, Im basically making an app that reads realtime data and makes a constantly changing graph based off of it, with some buttons and other interactive UI. What are the methods I need to implement For example, in regular Java, I know I would NEED to havep  precodepublic void init... public void paintGraphics g ... public void run... public static void main String argv[] ... ...and more codepre  pBased on sample code that I found it seems like I need the following general outline plus my own miscellaneous functions and classes.p  precodepublic class MyClass extends Activity     public void onCreateBundle savedInstanceStateinitialization and setup     public class MySurfaceView extends SurfaceView implements Runnable         public MySurfaceViewContext contextconstructor         public void onResumeMySurfaceView         public void onPauseMySurfaceViewdeal with user leaving the activity         public void run...         public boolean onTouchEvent...       codepre  pDo I need all of these What moreelse do I need And, what goes in each of the methods e.g., where does the stuff I would normally put in paintGraphics g gop  pI realize this is a very general question thats kind of big, and would appreciate either tips or a link to a tutorial that is more specific than, say, a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidappActivity.html relnofollowhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidappActivity.htmlap

Negative 3737 pI am trying to determine whether an object pointed by a T pointer is truly a T object, or some other, unrelated type. I tried dynamiccast, however it is less than useless, it returns the pointer itself instead of null even when it is obvious it does not point to a valid T objectp  precodeObject garbage  reinterpretcastltObjectgt0x12345678 if dynamiccastltObjectgtgarbage  NULL      cout ltlt Expected behaviour by me ltlt endl else     cout ltlt Youve got to be kidding me ltlt endl  codepre  pIs there any workaround for this, or some other solution Ive tried casting to void and char before the dynamiccast to no avail, typeid is not enough either since I want to accept subclasses as well.p  pSome context Im writing a custom Array class implementing shallow conversion between different kinds of Arrays, like codeArrayltObjectgtcode and codeArrayltStringgtcode, and I would like to guarantee a minimal type safety by doing a dynamic type check at every element access, for examplep  precodedefine DEBUG ArrayltStringgt v10 ArrayltObjectgt o  v o[0]  new Integer1        this is technically illegal but no idea how to check ArrayltStringgt w  o       this fails with an exception String str  v[0]           but this should fail horribly as well cout ltlt str ltlt endl codepre  pCasting to Object, then doing the type check on the Object works in a lot of cases, but it fails in the case of codeArrayltObjectgtcode, though I am not sure whether it is possible to insert something nonObject into an codeArrayltObjectgtcode without the use of reinterpretcast.p
Negative 3737 pI want to add a disclosure button to the callout popping out from the blue dot showing the users location. The only way to do that I have found thus far seems require subclassing MKAnnotationView and using MKCircleView, and then tying up the location accuracy to show the blue circle appropriately. This seems like a lot of work, and I find it strange if no one has had the same problem before. Do you know if there is a simple snippet or an open source library solving this problem convienentlyp

Negative 3737 pIm pretty up to speed with Objective C and IOS development, but I havent done any animations short of animatedYES sorts of things. p  pId like some advice on how to develop a page transition similar to that used in the Amazon Kindle App. When reading a book in the Kindle app, a swipe left or right turns the page. The page turn is indicated by the current page sliding to the right or left, and the new page coming in from the left or right. Its a good visual indication of whats going on without being overly flashy. Interestingly, if you dont swipe far enough, the current page snaps back into position.

Negative 3737 pI have a custom button with a round image.p  pThe problem is that the controller is square by default so whenever i click on the corners of the image, the button responds calling the associated method, when in reality he shouldnt because there is no image on the corners, so the button shouldnt respond.p  pAnyone knows a work around this bugp
Negative 3737 pThis is my first question here, so please let me know if theres anything I can provide to make my question clearer.  Thanksp  pIs there anyway to tweak MyBatis 3.0.4 so that when its running through the nested result maps and creating objects based on the results, it doesnt create duplicate objects and instead references the object that has already been created  To clarify, lets say Ive got an object that consists of the following simplified infop  precodePublic class PrimaryObject      Private Contact role1     Private Contact role2     Private ListltOtherObjectgt otherObjects     Public class OtherObject      Private String otherProperty     Private Contact otherRole  codepre  pAnd the result mapsSQL assume type aliasesp  precodeltmapper namespacePrimaryObjectgt     ltresultMap idprimaryObject typeprimaryObjectgt         ltassociation propertyrole1 columnROLE1ID          selectContact.findContactByPK gt         ltassociation propertyrole2 columnROLE2ID          selectContact.findContactByPK gt         ltcollection propertyotherObjects columnPRIMARYOBJECTID          javaTypeList ofTypeOtherObject          selectOtherObject.findOtherObjectsByPrimaryObjectPK gt     ltresultMapgt     ltselect idselectPrimaryObjectByPK parameterType...      resultMapprimaryObjectgt         SELECT  FROM PRIMARYOBJECTTABLE         WHERE PRIMARYOBJECTID  value     ltselectgt codepre  p...p  precodeltmapper namespaceOtherObjectgt     ltresultMap idotherObject typeotherObjectgt         ltresult propertyotherProperty columnOTHERPROPERTY gt         ltassociation propertyotherRole columnOTHERROLEID          selectContact.findContactByPK gt     ltresultMapgt     ltselect idfindOtherObjectsByPrimaryObjectPK parameterType...      resultMapotherObjectgt         SELECT OTHEROBJECT.OTHERPROPERTY, OTHEROBJECT.OTHERROLEID         FROM OTHEROBJECT JOIN PRIMARYOBJECT             ON PRIMARYOBJECT.PRIMARYOBJECTID  OTHEROBJECT.PRIMARYOBJECTID     ltselectgt codepre  p...p  precodeltmapper namespaceContactgt     ltresultMap idcontact typeContactgt         ltresult property...         ...     ltresultMapgt     ltselect idfindContactByPK parameterType... resultMapcontactgt         SELECT  FROM CONTACT...     ltselectgt codepre  pNow lets say a contact is acting as both coderole1code and coderole2code on codeprimaryObjectcode.  From what Ive seen, MyBatis creates the contact object referenced in coderole1code, and when it hits coderole2code, it simply references the object it created for coderole1code.  Thats greatp  pHowever, lets say that same contact is acting as the codeotherRolecode in codeotherObjectcode.  MyBatis now creates an identical contact object, as opposed to just referencing the original codecontactcode createdreferenced when making the codeprimaryObjectcode.  Is there any way I can prevent this from happening, and instead just store a reference in my codeotherObjectcode that references that same codecontactcode that the two different fields in codeprimaryObjectcode are pointing to  Ive been looking at a a hrefhttpcode.google.compmybatiswikiResultHandlerExample relnofollowcustom ResultHandlera, but the examples complexity coupled with my lack of experience is preventing me from understanding if it even addresses the problem Im trying to solve in the first place.  Thanks in advance for your help and patiencep

So im not sure what im doing wrong I leave here snippet of my code.p  pAppDelegatep  precode BOOLapplicationUIApplication application didFinishLaunchingWithOptionsNSDictionary launchOptions      [super applicationapplication didFinishLaunchingWithOptionslaunchOptions]     [self initTabBarMenu]      return YES       call when the app is not login  void showLogin       loginViewController  [[LoginViewController alloc] init]     [self.tabBarController presentModalViewControllerloginViewController animatedYES]  codepre  pLoginViewControllerp  precode void viewDidLoad      [super viewDidLoad]     NSUserDefaults defaults  [NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults]     NSString username  [defaults objectForKeyusernameApp]     NSString password  [defaults objectForKeypasswordAp]      if [StrUtil isEmptyusername] ampamp [StrUtil isEmptypassword]              userField.text  username         passwordField.text  password         [self loginCheck]          void loginCheck      NSString url  httplocalhostservicelogin       ASIFormDataRequest theRequest  [ASIFormDataRequest requestWithURL[NSURL URLWithStringurl]]     [theRequest setUseKeychainPersistenceYES]       [theRequest setDelegateself]     [theRequest addPostValueuserField.text forKeyusername]     [theRequest addPostValuepasswordField.text forKeypassword]     [theRequest setDidFinishSelectorselectorloginDone]     [theRequest setDidFailSelectorselectorloginFailed]     [theRequest startAsynchronous]     [userField resignFirstResponder]     [passwordField resignFirstResponder]    void loginResponseASIFormDataRequest theRequest      nsData  [[NSDictionary alloc] initWithDictionary[theRequest.responseString JSONValue]]     [self hideProgress]      if [[nsData objectForKeystatus] integerValue]  1               NSUserDefaults defaults  [NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults]         [defaults setObjectuserField.text forKeyusernameApp]         [defaults setObjectpasswordField.text forKeypasswordApp]          [defaults synchronize]          Remove current view controller         [self.parentViewController dismissModalViewControllerAnimatedYES]          else              [self showAlertProblem]       codepre  pHere is the problem when i get the menu, Im not getting any data from my webservices, actually the app doesnt even try to call it, Im using a BaseController to call every single webservice from there so I got my HomeViewController that extends from BaseController, so I got a generic method to call webservice on my BaseController like thisp  precode void callRequest      url is a NSString and you can set on HomeviewController     if [StrUtils isEmptyurl] return     request  [ASIHTTPRequest requestWithURL[NSURL URLWithStringurl]]     [request setDownloadCache[ASIDownloadCache sharedCache]]     [request setCachePolicyASIAskServerIfModifiedCachePolicyASIFallbackToCacheIfLoadFailsCachePolicy]     [request setSecondsToCache6060247]  Cache for 7 days     [[NSHTTPCookieStorage sharedHTTPCookieStorage] setCookieAcceptPolicyNSHTTPCookieAcceptPolicyAlways]      [request setDelegateself]     [request setResponseEncodingNSUTF8StringEncoding]     [request setDefaultResponseEncodingNSUTF8StringEncoding]     [request setDidFinishSelectorselectorrequestFinished]     [request setDidFailSelectorselectorfinishedWithError]     [request setTimeOutSeconds15]     [request startAsynchronous]    void requestFinishedASIHTTPRequesttheRequest      NSString responseString  [theRequest responseString]     nsData  [[NSDictionary alloc] initWithDictionary[responseString JSONValue]]      if [[receivedData objectForKeystatus] integerValue]  1              return [AppDelegate [[UIApplication sharedApplication] delegate] showLogin]          codepre  pAnd then i Call the webservice from viewDidLoadp  precode void viewDidLoad      [super viewDidLoad]     [self callRequest]   codepre  pHomeViewControllerp  precode id init      if self  [super init]              self.title  My Home         self.url  httplocalhostservicesgethome           return self  codepre  pSo in summary, the problem is i can not get any data for any section from my tabbarnavigation. The first time i click on 1 item, it loads loginviewcontroller even though login was previously successful and then call the webservice to the login in again. And directly after the second login, i can not get any data.p  pWell Im not sure what i can do, thanks for all your suggestion and answers. p

Negative 3737 pI have written a simple feedback application in django. Its not particulairly complex, basically it allows authenticated users to write a shot message with a subject line and submit that message via a form. I then allows who are in a selected group to view user submitted feedback. In the future I may add more functionality but for now it does what I want. p  pHere comes my question, the site Im building has multiple places where I would like to use the feedback app, for example I have a what do you think of the site kind of page at codedevfeedbackcode I also have one for customer support feedback at supportfeedback Currently I have just copied the code from my codemysite.apps.dev.feedbackcode over to codemysite.apps.support.feedbackcode. p  pThe problem is that this has now created two separate copies of the same code.

Negative 3737 pI have an ASP.NET MVC 3 application running in Azure. p  pIn one part of my application I want the user to be able to Create,Edit,Delete Documents Word, Excel in browser. p  pEDITp  pIve looking a three options right now, all with road blocking issues. p  p1 Open XML looked very appealing at first, since it does Almost everything I need and plays well with Azure. However, the one thing it doesnt do is allow a User to actually edit the doc in browser.p  p2 Using a WYSIWYG editor such as CKEditor or TinyMCE, since they allow the User to edit a doc in real time However not excel. The issue is I cant find a way to convert between Word and WYSIWYG formats HTML.p  pI was trying to find something in OpenXML that would convert the two formats. Essentially merging 1 and 2 together.p  p3 Lastly, which seems like the easiest and most comprehensive, is to integrate Office365 into the App. All I would need is for Office Web Apps Word,Excel to save files to Blob storage. Also if a User clicked on a file, it would open up Office and allow the user to edit and again save the file. There are a few issues Ive ran into with this tho. The only way Ive seen the functionality I want work is to use SharePoint Online, which is not an option for me. Also Im a little worried about salablityp  pIm leaning way more towards 3 since it seems like it would be the fastest and most graceful solution.p  pHave you come across a good way of directing Office Web Apps to store and edit files on Azure without involving SharePoint   p

This basically means that the core bridge thats been configured between the Forwarding HornetQ instance and the Destination HornetQ instance is problematic.p  pThe following are the relevant sections for configuring the core bridge on the Forwarding HornetQp  precodeltconnectorsgt             ltconnector namenettybridgegt                  ltfactoryclassgtorg.hornetq.core.remoting.impl.netty.NettyConnectorFactoryltfactoryclassgt                  ltparam keyhost valuedestination.xxx.comgt                  ltparam keyport value5445gt                  ltparam keybatchdelay value50gt                  ltparam keytcpsendbuffersize value1048576gt                  ltparam keytcpreceivebuffersize value1048576gt                  ltparam keyusenio valuetruegt            ltconnectorgt ltconnectorsgt ltaddresssettingsgt       ltaddresssetting matchjms.queue.Recordgt                 ltdeadletteraddressgtjms.queue.RecordDLQltdeadletteraddressgt                 ltmaxsizebytesgt262144000ltmaxsizebytesgt                 ltpagesizebytesgt10485760ltpagesizebytesgt                 ltaddressfullpolicygtPAGEltaddressfullpolicygt         ltaddresssettinggt ltaddresssettingsgt ltqueuesgt          ltqueue namejms.queue.Recordgt                   ltaddressgtjms.queue.Recordltaddressgt          ltqueuegt ltqueuesgt ltbridgesgt         ltbridge namecorebridgegt                 ltqueuenamegtjms.queue.Recordltqueuenamegt                 ltforwardingaddressgtjms.queue.Recordltforwardingaddressgt                 ltretryintervalgt1000ltretryintervalgt                 ltretryintervalmultipliergt1.0ltretryintervalmultipliergt                 ltreconnectattemptsgt1ltreconnectattemptsgt                 ltconfirmationwindowsizegt10485760ltconfirmationwindowsizegt                 ltstaticconnectorsgt                         ltconnectorrefgtnettybridgeltconnectorrefgt                 ltstaticconnectorsgt         ltbridgegt ltbridgesgt codepre  pThe following are the relevant sections for configuring the core bridge on the Destination HornetQp  precodeltacceptorsgt       ltacceptor namenettygt         ltfactoryclassgtorg.hornetq.core.remoting.impl.netty.NettyAcceptorFactoryltfactoryclassgt          ltparam keyhost  valuehornetq.remoting.netty.host192.168.2.xxxgt          ltparam keyport  valuehornetq.remoting.netty.portxxxxgt          ltparam keytcpsendbuffersize  value1048576gt          ltparam keytcpreceivebuffersize  value1048576gt          ltparam keyusenio  valuetruegt          ltparam keybatchdelay  value50gt          ltparam keyusenio  valuetruegt       ltacceptorgt ltacceptorsgt ltaddresssettingsgt           ltaddresssetting matchjms.queue.Recordgt                     ltdeadletteraddressgtjms.queue.RecordDLQltdeadletteraddressgt                     ltmaxsizebytesgt262144000ltmaxsizebytesgt                     ltpagesizebytesgt10485760ltpagesizebytesgt                     ltaddressfullpolicygtPAGEltaddressfullpolicygt             ltaddresssettinggt     ltaddresssettingsgt     ltqueuesgt              ltqueue namejms.queue.Recordgt                       ltaddressgtjms.queue.Recordltaddressgt              ltqueuegt     ltqueuesgt codepre  pAll system variables CPUMemoryDisk IONetworketc. are underutilized and there are no errors in the logs.p  pstrongNotestrong We have tried with both NIO as well as the legacyold IO.

When the Zoo receives Food it only makes sense to try to feed food to animals that eat that type of food.  p  pIve thought of a few solutions, but all seem to depend on the use of codeinstanceofcode somewhere and my various refactorings just seem to move it around.p  p1 I could implement codeeat Food foodcode in Animal and each subclass could choose to ignore food that it doesnt eat, but that is inefficient and would require that each Animal subclass use codeinstanceofcode to test the type of food.p  p2 I could keep three collections of animals in the Zoo based on the type of food they eat, but would still have to use codeinstanceOfcode to test the type of food to see which collection to feed it to.  At least this would be more efficient as I wouldnt be feeding food to Animals that wont eat it.p  pIve thought of some other approaches, but again, they just seem to pass the codeinstanceofcode buck.p  pAny suggestions  Or would this 2, at least be an acceptable use of codeinstanceofcodep

Negative 3737 pAre there any CSS toolkits that let you reproduce radio button functionality but using photos  images laid out in a grid For example, a grid of auto models on a rental car site, where the user needs to select a preferred vehicle for their rental application by clicking on the cars picture.p  pThis is similar to HTML selection menu widgets, exceptp  ul liThe layout is a grid, not a line of items i.e. needs to wrap.li liThe currentlyselected item is persistent and always visible, optionally with a checkmark or other iconbased indicator to show selectionli liIt would be great if the grid laid itself out intelligently recalculates rows and columns when the browser resizes.li liIt would also be nice to have the option to choose between singleselection radio button and multipleselection checkbox button modes.li ul  pI thought this would be straightforward but Ive had a really hard time finding anything like this.

If all the cities in the world and sister cities were stored in a linkedlist would this solve my problems  I would like a guarantee that once a city is built it does not move in memory.  Bad punp  pThis seems like a tricky problem to me.  As if I call a sister city of Detroit, I can call its sister cities, etc.  Then I could end up back at Detroit  If Topeka changes its name to Google, all of Topekas sister cities should automatically know as they are all pointing at the same spot in memory that Topeka is located.p  pAny advice is appreciatedp

Do to restrictions with our deployment process I am not the DBA, just a developer, we cannot include ECHO commands in the files.p  pTo get around this, as part of my batch script, I create a a hrefhttpdownload.oracle.comdocscdB1930601server.102b14357ch2.htmsthref414 relnofollowlogin.sqla file in the working directory that contains SET ECHO ON and SPOOL file.log APPEND commands. The goal was that this would be executed before the scripts and spool my output. However, while the SPOOL command seems to be working, the scripts contents are not being ECHOed.p  pHere is the relevant code from the batch scriptp  precode Identify all files that begin with a number and end with .sql and write to a file. dir b .sql  findstr b [09] gt ScriptsToImplement.txt   Show the user the files to be executed and confirm whether to proceed echo The following scripts will be executed in DB for f delims i in ScriptsToImplement.txt do echo i echo set p PROCEEDProceed with implementation [yn] gt if i PROCEED NEQ y goto opttoterminate   Build the user profile SQL file that will be executed after logging into SQLPlus  This allows for the spooling of the output without having the SPOOL command declared in the file. echo SET ECHO ON gtgt login.sql echo SPOOL DBFOLDERDATESTAMP.log APPEND gtgt login.sql   Go through the SQL files in the text file and execute them in the specified database. for f delims i in ScriptsToImplement.txt do  echo exit  sqlplus L S DBUSERDBPASSDB i if errorlevel NEQ 0 echo an error occurred with applying i stopping further script execution... amp pause amp goto terminate else echo i was applied successfully gtgt DATESTAMPrunall.log  codepre  pMy understanding is since this is launching a separate SQLPlus session with every separate script, it is calling the login.sql file every time and so should be using the SET ECHO ON command every time.p

I havent figured out what is different between the initial page navigation and the go forwardback navigations. p  pEDIT After digging around some more, it seems the first animation does in fact occur, just I dont see it because its the previous page. So my problem must be the animation is occuring after the new page is navigated to. p

Specifically Im referring things such adding codepcode to function names of predicates and prefixing variables with codemcode for module, codeccode for class etc.p  pFor example, if we want to define a predicate method like the following in C, we should use codepcode as a suffix in the function that defines the method.p  precodeclass MyClass   def awesome     true   end end codepre  pIn Cp  precodestatic VALUE myextensionmyclassawesomepVALUE self    return Qtrue   void Initmyextensionvoid    VALUE cMyClass  rbdefineclassMyClass, rbcObject    rbdefinemethodcMyClass,                    awesome,                    myextensionmyclassawesomep,                    0  codepre  pLooking through the core Ruby source code I see suffixes for codepcode predicate and codemcode, which Im not able to infer a meaning from.

Negative 3737 pI think it would be very comfortable to use the users password hash as the secret for generating a hmac. Why is OAuth and others using tokens and noncesp  pI think of something like thisp  pClient enters a password in the ui. The application registers with the webservice using the hash of that password, which is stored on the server. Form now on that hash hasnt to be transmitted again. The client can always regenerate the secret by asking the user to enter the password and hashing it. Every message is signed with this hash, the server can look it up by username or guid and check if the sent mac is valid.p  pA intruder on the server can get that hash, but doesnt know the users real password, anyway he could send valid request with that hash. But this is not likely to happen, the saved hashes could also be hashed again using a nonce. Anyway because the pwdfile will be on a clients server it should be obfuscated using e.g. base64 to avoid the file looking like passworda4bd146hashhashhash.p  pMost of all the real password of the user wont ever be transmitted. The requests will be secured with a timestamptoken against replay I recognize the purpose of the token here.p  pSending a hash would be perfectly applicable for me because the client will never be a simple website with a  tag e.g.. The webservice will be used in a ajaxbased application and a java desktop application, both of them capable of hashing strings...p  pWhats wrong with that Its so simple, more RESTFul than anything related to authentication, and i think yet effective.

Negative 3737 pI would like to use the Qt GUI library as the user interface for a VST plugin. A VST plugin is a DLL on windows. A host application calls various functions on the DLL, including things like codeopenGUIcode.p  pI want to know how to use Qt GUI from a DLL I have done some research to look at the possible options but Im not completely sure on the limitations.p  pThe main problem is where to create the codeQApplicationcode object and call codeexeccode on it which is a function that does not return until the application has quit.p  pI have looked at the solution given in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11054087startingqtguifromdllindllstartfunctionthis posta, but after further reading it would appear this solution will not work on Mac OS X, as Cocoa is more restrictive about the particular thread a GUI can run on. Its a bit of a hack really.p  pI have also seen a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1678937dllmainandqtmfcmigrationthis solutiona, but that relies on codeQMfcAppcode and codeQWinWindowcode which dont appear to be part of the Qt library any more.p  pIs the only way round this for my DLL to spawn off a new application itself Presumably I could start one with a call to codeQProcesscode and use some shared memory to share between the GUI application and my VST DLL Has anyone come across this type of problem Am I going down a bad route with this or is there something I havent thought of yetp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pAfter further research I have come across the a hrefhttpqtproject.orgdocqt4.8qabstracteventdispatcher.htmlcodeQAbstractEventDispatchercodea class. I have seen a hrefhttpqtproject.orgdocqt4.8qabstracteventdispatcher.htmlthis posta which seems to say its possible to call codeQApplicationprocessEventscode from your own the host of my plugin event loop instead of calling codeQApplicationexeccode. Has anyone tried doing thisp

Negative 3737 pI am developing an iOS app for iPad that needs to play videos in some part of the screen. I have several video files that needs to be played after each other in an order that is not given at compile time. It must looks as if it is just one video playing. It is fine that when going from one video to the next that is some delay where the last or first frame of the two videos are shown, but there should be no flickering or white screens with no content. The videos does not contain audio. It is important to take memory usage into account. The videos have a very high resolution and several different video sequences can be played next to each other at the same time.p  pIn order to obtain this I have tried a few solutions for far. They are listed belowp  h2strong1. AVPlayer with AVComposition with all the videos in itstrongh2  pIn this solution I have an AVPlayer that will use only on AVPlayerItem made using a AVComposition containing all the videos put in next to each other. When going to specific videos I seek to the time in the composition where the next video start.The issue with this solution is that when seeking the player will quickly show some of the frames that it is seeking by, which is not acceptable. It seems that there is no way to jump directly to a specific time in the composition. I tried solving this by making an image of the last frame in the video that just finished, then show that in front of the AVPLayer while seeking, and finally remove it after seeking was done. I am making the image using AVAssetImageGenerator, but for some reason the quality of the image is not the same as the video, so there is notable changes when showing and hiding the image over the video. Another issue is that the AVPlayer uses a lot of memory because a single AVPlayerItem holds all the videos.p  h2strong2. AVPlayer with multiple AVPlayerItemsstrongh2  pThis solution uses a AVPlayerItem for each video and the replaces the item of the AVPlayer when switching to a new video. The issue with this is that when switching the item of a AVPlayer it will show a white screen for a short time while loading the new item. To fix this the solution with putting an image in front with the last frame while loading could be used, but still with the issue that the quality of image and video is different and notable.p  h2strong3. Two AVPlayers on top of each other taking turns to play AVPlayerItemstrongh2  pThe next solution I tried was having two AVPlayer on top of each other that would take turns playing AVPlayerItems. So When on of the players is done playing it will stay on the last frame of the video. The other AVPlayer will be brought to the front with its item set to nil, so it is transparent, and the next AVPlayerItem will be inserted in that AVPlayer. As soon as it is loaded it will start playing and the illusion of smooth transaction between the two videos will be intact. The issue with this solution is the memory usage. In some cases I need to play two videos on the screen at the same time, which will result in 4 AVPlayers with a loaded AVPlayerItem at the same time. This is simply too much memory since the videos can be in a very high resolution.p  hr  pDoes anyone have some thoughts, suggestions, comments or something concerning the overall problem and the tried solutions posted above.p
Negative 3737 pIve looked through a couple of posts related to this but they dont seem to help me solve my problem. I have a project where the java files are indented with a 2space width. I would like to change everything to 4space width. I tried the correct indentation option but it just moves everything back to a 2space width when I modify a few lines to 4space indentation. Ive checked settings in JavaCode StyleFormatter and the default is 4space width. Ive also checked settings at GeneralEditorsText Editors and they are set to 4space tab width.p  pI thought the correct indentation may have been reading the whole java file and correcting the code so it conforms to everything else in the file, so I manually modified every line to have 4space width indentation. Autocorrect indentation still takes everything back to 2 spaces. Has anyone had this problem before Is there another setting to changep

My classes are too complex to post, but I made a simple class to test and its still happening.p  pI created a class abc which has a couple of properties which are not null in the database.

The row is not in the database, and if I copy the SQL from SQL profiler I get the correct error of cannot insert null into column....p  pThe problem is that Im creating a couple of objects within a transaction and if one fails I expect an error to be thrown so that I can rollback all, but since the errors are not bubbling, I cant catch them, so I cant rollback.p  pThe below isnt actually code but to demonstrate what I meanp  precodeusing NHibernate.ITransaction tx  Session.BeginTransaction      try               Should Fail         ABC a1  new ABC         a1.prop1  1234         Session.SaveOrUpdatea1           Should Save         ABC a2  new ABC         a2.prop1  1234         a2.prop2  1234         Session.SaveOrUpdatea2           Should Fail         ABC a3  new ABC         Session.SaveOrUpdatea3          tx.Commit           catch Exception ex              tx.Rollback         throw ex       codepre  pIn the above objects codea1code and codea3code should throw errors and do as seen in the output window as the inserts fail, but it doesnt get caught by the codecatch code statement, it just steps through and so codetx.commitcode runs and codea2code is persisted to the database which codeshouldntcode happen.p  pAny Ideas Ty.p

Negative 3737 pI recently created a RPG from scratch, but the movement is very choppy, as expected, because I am essentially moving the terrain around the character in a 15x15 grid, with each section being 50 pixels large and holding a single texture. Movement is facilitated by change in coordinates followed by a rearranging the terrain and refreshing the frame. An example of what I do is herep  precodeforint i  0 ilt15 i      forint j  0 jlt15 j               g.drawImageimageOfGrass, i50, j50, 50, 50, this       codepre  pObviously, the switch between grids is not at all smooth because I am simply moving an image across 50 pixels. To make a similarity with my game, the preNintendo DS Pokemon and Zelda games come to mind.p  pMy question, then, is this, followed by another minor question if you will allow that 1. Is there a somewhat simple solution in Java that can slide an imagep  pI have thought of creating an animated GIF to simply show the character moving, while in reality or virtual reality, rather  har har the avatar is still on the grid until the GIF finishes the animation. I expect some choppiness from this, though, from refreshes.p  ol liIf I were to want to create a fully functional RPG game, where should I startli ol  pWhile researching, I have found articles either too simple here is a framework, knock yourself out sort of thing, or too complex Prerequisites are ..... While I understand that creating a game of that scope is not simple and will take some time, I would very much like to learn. In that sense, my objective is not to create a completed project, but learn the code and programming associated with it.  Ideally, I want to learn a language from an existing framework, to which I can then continue to build upon to create my own, unique game. Currently I am a junior and will have a reduced number of classes next year as a result of my grades, so I hope, if not too ambitious, that I can use this time and have my own running not necessarily complete game by the end of summer next year.p  pI apologize for the length of text, and I thank you for your time.p

Negative 3737 pI am having a puzzling issue that I cant find an answer for. I am trying to Upload a large ammount of data to a WCF service and it will return a 413 error on first and subsequent tries until a request under the 64kb limit is sent after that the large data request is accepted.  I have already extended the maxReceivedMessageSize and maxStringContentLength elements in my binding and the this fixes the issue when sending a request after an initial small request if these arent extended a different error 400 is returned not a 413.p  pMy system is an ASP.NET 3.5 application running on IIS 7 and the WCF service uses custom binding, SOAP messages and clientserver certificates. p  pBasically the order to reproduce is as follows tested on 2 serversp  ul liIIS7 worker process starts upli lisend request greater than 64kb returns 413 errorli lisend any more requests greater than 64kb returns 413 errorli liSend request less than 64kb returns 200 and valid soap responseli lisend request greater than 64kb returns 200 and valid soap responseli ul  pIf the maxReceivedMessageSize and maxStringContentLength elements arent increased the following happensp  ul liIIS7 worker process starts upli lisend request greater than 64kb returns 413 errorli lisend any more requests greater than 64kb returns 413 errorli liSend request less than 64kb returns 200 and valid soap responseli lisend request greater than 64kb returns 400 errorli ul  pDebugging suggests that when receiving the 413 error the server hasnt really initialized my service and once a small request comes in it is initialized and pays attention to my binding rules and then allows for large data quantities.p  pI suspect this is an issue inside the WCF library and may be fixed by upgrading but that isnt really an option and a need a work around.

When I release the mouse, sometimes the box disappears, and sometimes, it doesnt. When it doesnt, the box keeps being drawn and follows mouse movements as defined to do when Im dragging.p  pIn the jsFiddle, if you watch console.debug or the paragraph reporter under the canvas, youll see that on occasion, onmouseup doesnt fire when you release the mouse I checked for mouseup as well, but that has the same issue. In cases where onmouseup never fires, onmousemove continues to fire. If you click again, sometimes a full mouse click series fires down, up, click, and move, which then makes the drawn rectangle disappear. Sometimes this doesnt happen, though, and onmousemove keeps firing. If you click after the dragonmousemove becomes stuck and nothing happens, there are no debug lines or changes to reporters for those events, so its as if all mouse events except onmousemove are being squelched. I tried adding in stopPropagation, stopImmediatePropagation, and preventDefault, but that didnt help. I also tried using Dojo events stop, but that didnt change the behavior. p  pFor redrawing the box in onmousemove, Ive tried both getShape  edit properties  setShape as well as deleting the shape and making a whole new one neither of these methods stopped the problem and there wasnt any appreciable difference between them. p  pIm using Dojo 1.8.3, and this happens in both Chrome v25 and Firefox v19, with either Canvas or SVG as the renderer.p  pThoughts Am I missing something obvious herep

Negative 3737 pI have a header with two elements in it. The first is an image that is a company logo and is set to 25 width. The other is a nav bar with its elements set inline so it is horizontal. Id like for the navigation bar to be set vertically center but for the life of me cant figure it out. Ive set everything I know to an element that can use verticalalign and put everything in display inline or table cell to apply it. Nothing works.p  pKeep in mind that the reason I dont just give it a static percentage padding or margin top is because as the page gets wider the image height expands as the width does so as you expand the browser horizontally the nav becomes more and more out of place. p  pI would greatly appreciate any help as Ive tried  much longer than id like to admit on just centering an object vertically. p  pHTML cut downp  precodeltdiv idcontainergt ltheader idheader rolebannergt     ltimg srcimages gt     ltnav idnav rolenavigationgt     ltulgt         ltligtlta href titleAbout UsgtAbout Usltagtltligtltligtlta href titleBiographiesgtBiographiesltagtltligtltligtlta href titleServicesgtServicesltagtltligtltligtlta href titleCareersgtCareersltagtltligtltligtlta href titleContactgtContactltagtltligt     ltulgt     ltnavgt ltheadergt codepre  pCSS cut downp  precodeheader img      height auto     width 25     float left       header nav      width 75     fontsize 1em       header nav li      display inlineblock      width 19       header nav li a      background 2CB2E6     lineheight  codepre  pHeres a simple jsFiddle a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netLbTCT relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netLbTCTa p

Negative 3737 pI have an object with lots of properties that I would like to test.  I have written a codeTestMethodcode for each property, but the problem is that many of the properties manipulate the others when they are set.  What I need is to be able to set up my test object, manipulate one of the variables, run the tests, reset the object to its original state, then repeat the process.  That way, I can avoid having so much redundancy.p  pI looked into using a Data Driven approach which is a perfect solution to this problem, but that doesnt seem to be available with the Silverlight Test Framework, since I cant find a way to use the codeDataSourcecode attribute.  I thought about trying to see if I could get access to the codeDataSourcecode through the traditional MSTest framework, but alas, I only have Visual Studio Express.p  pIve thought to try to look into creating a custom test harness to see if that could solve this problem, but I thought Id ask around for suggestions first.p  pMaybe I should just suck it up and write up all of the different configurations as separate codeTestInitializecode Methods and comment out the ones I dont need as I go.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.p  h2UpdateClarificationh2  pHere is an example of how the object to be tested works.

Negative 3737 pIm currently working in PHP. Im working on a error system for my CMS Im building for the fun of it. For fatal errors in my system not in the php compiler I created a FatalException class that extends the built in Exception class.  Since these types of errors kinda halt the system anyway, I threw in a exit into the construct. p  precode    class FatalException extends Exception           public function constructmessage              exitlth1 stylecolorred gtFATAL ERROR message lth1gt               codepre  pSo in my code Ill check something like the connection to the database and if it cant then Ill just throw a FatalExceptionCant connect to database databaseerrormessage. It wont be in a trycatch block. p  pWhen I run the code and cant connect to the database, for example, all I see on the screen is a sentence in big red letters. So it works just fine, but is this bad practicecodingp  pEDIT p  pActually in truth it didnt start out this way. I was originally logging the error and then exiting in the catch area, but then I thought, if all fatal errors are going to exit anyway then just put in the in constructor. Then I noticed it wasnt actually getting to the catch area it was exiting. So putting the statement in a trycatch block was kind of a moot point. Which lead to the question. p

I greatly appreciate all help given.p  pemstrongEDITemstrongp  pHere is the code that works, thanks to members of this site for all the helpp  precodevoid getFileNamechar fileName[]  int main     char fileName[256]    getFileNamefileName    cout ltlt fileName    return 0   void getFileNamechar fileName[]     cout ltlt Please enter the filename     cin gtgt fileName    return  codepre  pThe problem I did not understand how an array functions.

Negative 3737 pI have a set of css bullets that come along with the Orbit javascript slider by Zurb Foundation.  The bullets have a floatleft that is necessary so that they line up horizontally when new slides are introduced.  Removing the float stacks them vertically....p  pI need to position the bullets to the pixel vertically on my page sadly, and Ive had trouble with various browsers, having to use browserspecific css.  I turned to jqueryUI to position my bullets based on the Div above it, but there are a couple issues.  p  pThe bullets need to be positioned in the center below the slider...and the slider fluidly resizes with the page.  JqueryUI can position the bullets on page load, but on resize the positioning gets screwed up due to the float on the bullets...p  pJust wondering if anybody can think of a solution off the top of their head...Ive been stumped for a while lol.

Negative 3737 pI am new to C, so bear with me. I have a problem in c where I cant decide on whether I need a class or a struct. Im creating a List of either the class or struct and adding elements to it. If I use a struct, then I can add an item, alter it, and add it again and the changes will be seen because it is passed by value. The problem is, structs are not mutable so I cant edit any of the elements later. If I use a class, then if I add an item and alter it, all the items in the list get changed. I have to create a new instance of the object each time if I want it to be different.

Negative 3737 pI have been working on highlighting a text in UIwebview. In that I used canPerformAction method in which i call a javascript function to highlight the text.

The first test went fine  although it has appeared when I use the hist command  this time it appeared when I tried to get the working directory, witch Ive been able to do without error. p  pIm not sure if it is a fault at my end or if it is a bug in KnitrLyx  hopefully you can help me determined whichever it is.  p  pimg srchttpi.imgur.comDMEiXgG.png altp  p EDIT Lyxlog as requested.p  precode224742.732 Previewing ... 224742.739 bufferview CtrlR 224742.779 Rscript verbose nosave norestore CProgram Files x86LyX 2.0Resourcesscriptslyxknitr.R CUsersToddiAppDataLocalTemplyxtmpdir.Hp4668lyxtmpbuf2newfile1.Rnw CUsersToddiAppDataLocalTemplyxtmpdir.Hp4668lyxtmpbuf2newfile1.tex ISO885915 CUsersToddiDocuments Running Rscript verbose nosave norestore CProgram Files x86LyX 2.0Resourcesscriptslyxknitr.R CUsersToddiAppDataLocalTemplyxtmpdir.Hp4668lyxtmpbuf2newfile1.Rnw CUsersToddiAppDataLocalTemplyxtmpdir.Hp4668lyxtmpbuf2newfile1.tex ISO885915 CUsersToddiDocuments 224743.408                                                                                                                                                  0                                                 224743.409                              ......................                                             33 224743.409   ordinary text without R code 224743.409  224743.409                                                                              ...........................................                        67 224743.409 label test 224743.410 running 224743.410   CPROGRA1RR301.1bini386Rterm.exe slave norestore nosave norestore fileCProgram Files x86LyX 2.0Resourcesscriptslyxknitr.R args CUsersToddiAppDataLocalTemply 224743.410 xtmpdir.Hp4668lyxtmpbuf2newfile1.Rnw CUsersToddiAppDataLocalTemplyxtmpdir.Hp4668lyxtmpbuf2newfile1.tex ISO885915 224743.411  224743.411  224743.411  224743.411 processing file CUsersToddiAppDataLocalTemplyxtmpdir.Hp4668lyxtmpbuf2newfile1.Rnw 224743.456  224743.457 Advarsel i blockexecparams  224743.457   failed to tidy R code in chunk lttestgt 224743.459 reason Error in baseparsetext  text, srcfile  NULL  31 unexpected  224743.459 2 histq 224743.459 3  224743.460    224743.460  224743.460 Quitting from lines 1115 CUsersToddiAppDataLocalTemplyxtmpdir.Hp4668lyxtmpbuf2newfile1.Rnw  224743.461 Fejl i parsetext  x, srcfile  src  lttextgt31 unexpected  224743.461 2 histq 224743.461 3  224743.461    224743.461 Calls knit ... evaluate gt parseall gt parseall.character gt parse 224743.461 Execution halted ......srcsupportSystemcall.cpp 273 Systemcall Rscript verbose nosave norestore CProgram Files x86LyX 2.0Resourcesscriptslyxknitr.R CUsersToddiAppDataLocalTemplyxtmpdir.Hp4668lyxtmpbuf2newfile1.Rnw CUsersToddiAppDataLocalTemplyxtmpdir.Hp4668lyxtmpbuf2newfile1.tex ISO885915 CUsersToddiDocuments finished with exit code 1 Error Cannot convert file  An error occurred while running Rscript verbose nosave norestore CProgram Files x86LyX 2.0Resourcesscriptslyxknitr.R CUsersToddiAppDataLocalTemplyxtmpdir.Hp4668lyxtmpbuf2newfile1.... 225100.499 Automatic save done. 225151.362 Error while previewing format pdf2 codepre  pEDIT 2p  pDo you mean thisp  precode Preview source code for paragraph 0   ltlttestgtgt q lt rnorm100 histq ltlttest2gtgt getwd  codepre  pIve added a line between codecode and codeltlttestgtgtcode and it now works.

Negative 3737 pI have tried every way suggested hear to read values from a single column text file. They are pos and neg float values.

One thing to note is i am sorting codeProjectCommentscode and only taking the most recent one. Should i be using combination of codejoincode and codegroup by intocode Help will be much appreciated. Thanks.p  pUPDATEDp  pSorry, if i wasnt clear enough on what i am trying to do. Basically, in front end, i have a grid, which shows list of projects with latest project comments and list of all the files associated to project, so users can click on those links and actually open those documents. So the query that i have above is working and it does show the following in the gridp  pProject ID From Project table Status From Project table ExpiresOn From Project table LatestComments latest entry from ProjectComments table which has project ID as foreign key ProjectFileIDs list of file ids from ProjectFiles table which has Project ID as foreign key  i am using those File IDs and creating links so users can open those files.p  pSo everything is working, i have it all setup, but the query is little slow. Right now we have very little data only test data, but once this is launched, i am expecting lot of usersdata and thus i want to optimize this query to the best, before it goes live.

Negative 3737 pLike any other C programmer, I face the problem of how best to express the copying of objects.

All options have pros and cons, but one issue common to all of them is the emtypingem problem.p  pI would like to state, in whatever way possible, that there exists a copy operation on all objects in my class hierarchy emthat always produces an object of the same type as the originalem  in such a way that any violation against this is reported at compile time.p  pNone of these three options allow me to do this, even with generics. Apparently, C doesnt allow me to do it emat allem neither do Java and some other languages I know.p  pWhy not Is such a feature in the type system too hard to implement Does it cause inconsistencies Is my wish for an accurately typed copy operation considered a corner case Is there some other way of achieving this that Ive missedp  pPS Please note that this question is not about a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3345389copyconstructorversusclonethe difference between shallow and deep copya, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions78536deepcloningobjectsincsharphow to copya, or a hrefhttpwww.agiledeveloper.comarticlescloning072002.htm relnofollowwhether to do it at alla.p

Negative 3737 pCan I close the serial port from puttyp  pI have another C program that only opens the port when it needs to do its business and promptly closes the port when its done. I can therefore open up putty, start a session, and interact with the serial line, but I cant seem to figure out how get putty to emcloseem the port so I can go back to the first program. I could close putty, but then I lose the data in the window and have to reopen putty when I need it again, so thats not a good solution.p  pIve found that I can force putty into an inactive state by emphysicallyem unplugging the USBserial adapter Im using  this causes a codePuTTY Fatal Error Error reading from serial devicecode, which then puts the session into an inactive state title bar reads codeCOM3  PuTTY inactivecode and adds a menu bar command to Restart Session. I can plug the adapter back in and use it with the first program and then restart the putty session with the aforementioned command and continue the process. But obviously Id like to be able to do this without physically unplugging the adapter...p  pAny thoughtsp

Negative 3737 pIm trying to find the degrees of visibility of natural environments from a number of viewpoints. I have a DEM, and a raster defining the natural environments. For each cell I have slope, height, aspect and distance from viewpoint. I want to calculate the angle between the viewpoint and each cell. p  pI originally did this by getting the x,y,z coordinates for the viewpoint and the both the bottom and top of a sloped cell. Then get the 3D distance between each coordinate and use these distances to get the angles. I would then sum for each cell to get total degrees of visibilty.p  pProblem is that this approach only works when the bearing between the viewpoint and the visible cell is in line with the x and y axis of the coordinate system. This because to calculate the points coordinates for the cell corners Im subtracting and adding the cell resolution2 to the cell centroid.    p  pCode below p  precodedef CellLoc VPX, VPY, VPZ, cellx, celly, cellz, aspect, cellresolution, bearing     import math     from math import sqrt     Get change in height of cell using slope and cell resolution trig     AspectTan  math.tanmath.radiansaspect     Opposite  AspectTan  cellres      Get coordinates for cell corners     CloseCornerX  centx  2.5     CloseCornerY  centy  2.5     FarCornerX  centx  2.5     FarCornerY  centy  2.5     CloseCornerZ  centz  Opposite2     FarCornerZ  centz  Opposite2  Get Distance between coordinates        VP  VPX, VPY, VPZ data point 1     cellcrner1  CloseCornerX, CloseCornerY, CloseCornerZ data point 2     cellcrner2  FarCornerX, FarCornerY, FarCornerZ         disttofarcorner  sqrtsum VP  cellcrner22 for VP, cellcrner2 in zipVP, cellcrner2     disttoclosecorner  sqrtsum VP  cellcrner12 for VP, cellcrner1 in zipVP, cellcrner1     celldist  sqrtsum cellcrner1  cellcrner22 for cellcrner1, cellcrner2 in zipcellcrner1, cellcrner2   Input above distances into ViewAngle to find angle  def ViewAngle a, b, c     calculates the viewing angle of each visible cell     import math      a2  aa     b2  bb     c2  cc     VA  a2b2c2 2.0  ac     rads  math.acosVA     return math.degreesrads    codepre  pHow can I improve this code, or maybe another approach is a better way of doing it.

Negative 3737 pIm currently developing a threaded network application well, two actually, but with a common base, and am using nCurses for the interface.p  pThe problem is, that currently I am trying to start two threads the GUI thread is listening for the keyboard to fire, and, when it does, will build a message up in memory. When enter is pressed, this is passed over to the server thread, which passes it over the network.p  pThe server thread listens for a connection. When it receives one, it enters a loop look if there is any data from the connection, if there is, send it to the GUI thread, which then displays it. Then, check for anything from the GUI, send it over the network, and so on.p  pThe problem is, that I can receive messages just fine been testing with Telnet up until this point..., and the message gets to the GUI thread fine. printf will display it just fine however it feels dirty mixing printf and nCurses, but printw will just present me with a newline for my trouble. When I individually access characters, things seem to work.p  precodechar messageRcv messageRcv  streamrcvnblockstream  ifmessageRcv  NULL      ifmessageRcv[0]  xFF          printws, messageRcv         refresh           freemessageRcv  codepre  pThis is the code which should, in theory, display the message. For the record, 0xFF is acting, for now, as the connection has closed code. Quick and dirty, but this is very early days right now, so I dont care.p  pAny assistance with this issue would be greatly appreciated, as I have nothing.

Negative 3737 pWithin an OnClick event for a button, I have the following codep  precodeKeyboardService.ShowVirtualKeyboardSomeEditTextField codepre  pIt runs, and no errors, however, nothing happens. I would expect this to show the keyboard for the corresponding control. What am I doing wrong p  pDelphi xe5, developing for iOS.p  pupdate  My core problem is  I am using an application that makes use of a iOS supported bluetooth scanner which acts as keyboard input. On the scanner but not all of the scanners we will be using there is a button to toggle the keyboard state. E.g., switch between scanner input and showing virtual on screen keyboard. I want to simulate this same functionality but on the applicaiton UI itself, to compensate for the possible scanners that do not have this toggle button. Ive been told... that calling the above procedure will override and display the on screen keyboard even if a hardware input is present.p  pUPDATE 111 So.. I have by chance come across some interesting information. When pressing the escape does the exact toggle feature I want. Now the question is, how do I simulate pressing the escape key from a Tbutton  How would I send that escape key to the application p

Negative 3737 pI am currently using python to execute my code. My input into this function is a list within a list like code[ [1,2,3],[4,5],[6,7,8,9] ]code The goal is to iterate and create all the possible combinations for each list.p  pThe only way I have it in my mind is to do multiple for loops on each sublist within the master list. Each combination must have at least one element from each sublist so since there are 3 sublists, all combinations must have 3 elements. codefor a in [1,2,3]    for b in [4,5]      for c in [6,7,8,9]        l.append[a,b,c]code p  pSo one combination would be [1,4,6],[1,4,7],[1,4,8],[1,4,9]. And the next loop with be [1,5,6]..[1,5,7]...and so forth.p  pThis works but my problem is that I dont know how many sublists will be in the master list input so I cant just keep writing for loops indefinitely. I know there must be a way to write a recursive function but I have never done this and dont know how it works. I dont think it should be too difficult but can someone show me the algorithm to accomplish this pleasep  pThank you so muchp

Negative 3737 pI am currently trying to get used to CoreBluetooth and iBeacon on iOS 7. While searching through the API, I noticed that there seem to be three ways of creating and using iBeacons, and I am not 100 sure what the differences are and when to use which. The ways I found arep  ul lipA locationbased approach using codeCBPeripheralManagercode and codeCLLocationManagercode with a codeCLBeaconRegioncode. This has the advantage that it gives me information about the proximity of the devices. But since this is a locationbased approach it seems to me that I cannot transfer data with this, which is something I need. pli lipUsing the Multipeer Connectivity Framework classes, codeMCNearbyServiceBrowsercode and codeMCNearbyServiceAdvertisercode. This is very easy to set up, allows me to transfer arbitrary data but I get no information about the proximity of the two devices, which I need.pli lipI found an a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiossamplecodeBTLETransferIntroductionIntro.html relnofollowexample projecta by Apple where they use codeCBCentralManagercode and codeCBPeripheralcode. This allows me to transfer arbitrary data and get limited proximity information I get the RSSI but no signal accuracy, but seems pretty complex since there are lots of callbacks and I have to take care of stuff like flow control myself.pli ul  pSo I guess my question is Is there a preferred way When to use which method Can they be combined For example, could I listen to other devices using the locationbased approach and then connect to the device when it is nearby using the Multipeer Framework If so, how could I make sure that I dont accidentally connect to the wrong devicep  pThanksp

There is an EEPROM connected via SPI bus to the SSP port.  p  pThe objective is to read the EEPROM into SRAM for faster accessing.  p  pThe present working code sends a read command to the EEPROM, the reads the data byte per byte, which takes a long time.  p  pI want to use the DMA to read EEPROM on the SPI bus directly, without intervention from the CPU.  p  pHere is my code snippet  p  precode Initialize the DMA for use with SPI bus.

The simplest way to fix this problem is to add a spacer element to the bottom of the container something like div styleclear both div see this StackOverflow question and its associated answers for more details.p blockquote  pCare to take a look and shed some light on the problemp  pHeres my function and a working a hrefhttpplnkr.coedithHboAx1Q6TCG7Vqi2zjqppreview relnofollowPlunkera.p  precode    var page  0     scope.releases  []     scope.loadDetails  functionid          page         console.logpage         http.gethttpapi.discogs.comartists  id  releasespage  page  ampperpage12.thenfunctiondata2              scope.releases  data2.releases                   codepre

Negative 3737 pWhat Im trying to do is simply make a ball rebound from a wall. Everything works OK, except the fact I want to be able to increase the speed of movement. Literally, the speed is how much xvalue is added measured in px to the balls current position. The thing is, when Im increasing the codevar speedcode, the ball floats out of the bounds, because the rebounding is checked by  the difference between the bound and the current position of the ball.p  pupdatep  pIve used the technique suggested by Mekka, but still did something wrong.The ball doesnt float outside anymore, yet something pushes it out of the bounds for several pixelsdoesnt let the ball float several more pixels to reach the bounds. p  pMy new code looks like thisp  precode  the boundsdescribing object var border      X[8,302],  left and right borders in px      Y[8,302],  top and bottom borders in px              indX1, border index for array       indY0, border index for array Y     changeIndfunctionnreturn this[n]  this[n]   function to change the index       ifball.position.left  speed gt border.X[1]  ball.position.left  speed lt border.X[0]                  var distX    border.X[border.indX]  ball.position.left                 var distY    border.X[border.indX]  ball.position.left  k                     ball.cssleft, distX                 ball.csstop, distY                  border.changeIndindX                 speed  speed                             ifball.position.top  k gt border.Y[1]  ball.position.top  k lt border.Y[0]                  var distX    border.Y[border.indY]  ball.position.top  k                 var distY    border.Y[border.indY]  ball.position.top                     ball.cssleft, distX                 ball.csstop, distY                  border.changeIndindY                  k  k       codepre  pAnother problem is that my codes math is incorrect sometimes, the reason of which I absolutely cant figure out.

Negative 3737 pI have an Android project in Eclipse managed by Maven. Yesterday I upgraded Eclipse and some plugins by the Checked for Updated function within Eclipse. After the update has finished, my Android project was defective. First I thought that its just a CleanUpdate ProjectMaven Rebuild issue or maybe the order of the includes of the libraries didnt fit anymore for example, Maven dependencies are not on top or something similar, but I was able to build by Maven, so no project or Maven problems, but an Eclipse problem. To get it working again I had to add Hamcrest, Junit and Mockito from the Maven repo to the build path manually. I didnt had to do that before in this project except android4.1.1.4.jar.  I would like to understand when and why I suddenly have to do that In an earlier project I also had to add some external libraries manually.p  pI always build and my project by strongclean install

Negative 3737 pI am having issues while trying to run a Jooq autogenerate gradle task that takes table infos from a cleardb cloud based database.p  pThe error i get is below and has apparently something to do with the fact that i have limited access to the clearDB cloud service. In short, the script asks to see the content of proc  which holds all the procedures that I might have stored on the remote DB. The thing is that I do not use procedure and I wish to have this operation ignored completely.p  pis there a way to tell jooq autogeneration to not query PROCp  precodeError while fetching functions

This works surprisingly well, the issue is this is not a pretty way of achieving this. I am also not showing all the break points  it breaks into, 3 2 1 columns based on window size. It runs very poorly because its firing on every window resize, and Im wondering if there is a cleaner way to do this where the functions would only fire once when they hit the window size. p  pAlso  this is only to size gridster strongdownstrong, so if you size out it will not expand, I have not tried building those functions yet. p  pAny pointers or suggestions in using something that maybe isnt listening to every single instance of a window resize would be super helpful.p  pThanksp

Unfortunately, this seems to be impossible thanks to the file not actually be accessible until the action is finished.p  pIs there some way around this in Rails, some type of flush call or route refresh or handle closer  Im not sure why its even hanging in this case.

Negative 3737 pI often need to make many edits to text files. The files are typically 20 MB in size and require 500,000 individual edits, all which must be made in a very specific order. Here is a simple example of a script I might need to usep  precodewhile read r line do     ...     20100 lines of BASH commands preparing a and b     ...     sed i sabg .editfile.txt     ... done lt .readfile.txt codepre  pAs many other lines of code appear before and after the codesedcode script, it seems the only option for editing the file is codesedcode with the codeicode option. Many have warned me against using codesed icode, as that makes too many writes to the file. Recently, I had to replace two computers, as the hard drives stopped working after running the scripts. I need to find a solution that does not damage my computers hardware.p  pIs there some way to send files somewhere else, such as storing the whole file into a BASH variable, or into RAM, where I codesedcode, codegrepcode, and codeawkcode, can make the edits without making millions of writes to the hard drivep

Negative 3737 pUsing IE11 on Windows 8.1, I have a strange problem when displaying a popup screen using window.showModalDialog in JavaScript over a web page containing an ActiveX MSFlexGrid control. The flexgrid onclick event is set up in the main form with this line of scriptp  precodeltSCRIPT LANGUAGEjavascript FORWarningSignalsControl EVENTClickgt     alertflexgrid clicked ltSCRIPTgt codepre  pWhen the modal is displayed and it is moved so that its Close button is over the main pages flexgrid, clicking on the button activates the flexgrid once the modal has closed. This does not happen if the button is not over the flexgrid. The effect is as though the click is somehow passing through the modal screen to the page beneath, but as this is presumably impossible, it seems more likely that the click is being propagated to the main page immediately on modal screen closure.p  pThe HTML for the button and its associated onclick function is as followsp  precodeltbutton onclickReturnValevent, vbOKgtCloseltbuttongt  function ReturnVale, iValue       e.cancelBubble  true     window.returnValue  iValue     window.close  codepre  pAs youll see, I have tried adding the line cancelBubble  true to the onclick function, in case the click event was being propagated to the main page, but it made no difference. We are running IE11 in Compatibility Mode, so stopPropagation and preventDefault are not available I tried them.p  pThe problem does not occur in IE6 or IE8.  I wondered if there was an issue using deprecated function showModalDialog with IE11, but Microsoft have stated that it is fine to do that.p  pAny thoughts would be appreciated.p  pstrongUPDATE  SOLUTION FOUNDstrongp  pThis appears to be a synchronisation problem, which I fixed by placing the modal screens window.close statement inside a setTimeout.

Negative 3737 pI have two sets of data, one for Clients and one for the Vacancies of the clients. So In my table I have successfully created a button which when clicked displays Client results, this includes a ClientID and a Client Name. I have also linked in some Vacancy details where I manage to to tally the amount of vacancies they have in relation to the client. Right now I would like to create a fourth table header which is populated with links that will bring the user to another page which displays those vacancies, instead of just tallying them up in another header. I will paste the code except from the data to see if this helps. This is my 8th day of coding with MVC and still find it confusing at time.

Instead, I converted the pandas series to lists and looped through the lists with the formula.

Negative 3737 pYes, the title of this question is horrible but after 5 minutes of trying to figure out how to word it I moved onp  pI am starting the design phases of a standalone authorization server C, Web API, Azure for a software platform that is receiving a significant overhaul. I read the always great articles by Taiseer Joudeh a hrefhttpbitoftech.net20140601tokenbasedauthenticationaspnetwebapi2owinaspnetidentity relnofollowhttpbitoftech.net20140601tokenbasedauthenticationaspnetwebapi2owinaspnetidentitya on the subject and have the implementation mostly mapped out in my head. The external users of the authorization server app developers who will be consuming the services from various end points will have a portal that they can log into and manage their accounts, white list IP addresses, select their API version similar to how Stripe does it and other various administrative tasks. p  pWhat has me hung up are the two different real world happens today scenarios where a caller has more than one unit on their access access the API and processing transactions. Below is a summary of the current requirements could change, nothing is set in stone if there is a good argument I have not considered as well as the two scenarios I am struggling with. p  pQuestion Do I allow my authorized customers customers with access to an account on the auth server to define 1N number of apps that will have their own refreshauth tokens...p  pstrongFactsstrongp  ul lipMany of my clients run multiple servers which process transactions through the platform. These may be dedicated on prem servers or worker roles in Azure and everything in between.pli lipThe implementation must support long periods of time between API calls without the need to fully reauthenticate. Some clients make calls once a month.pli lipI like Boxs implementation Refresh tokens are valid for 60 days, access tokens are valid for 1 hour. Each new access token provides a new refresh token.pli lipThe customers within the portal will have to whitelist their IP addresses and new access tokens and with them new refresh tokens will only be handed out to a request coming from one of their whitelisted IPs.pli lipThe token must contain the version number for the application for which the token is being requested for use in the destination app controller selection. See SO for more details. Every refresh of the access token issues a new refresh token.pli lipThe refresh tokens are not burned until the first successful call with the new access token in case the new access token is lost in transit, the client can obtain a new access token with the previous refresh token.pli lipI have not committed to this yet but it seems like a value add with little downside given the whitelisted IP addresss.pli lipAccess tokens will have a very short life 15 mins. This is both for security purposes as well as API version migrations since the version will be in the token.pli ul  pstrongConcernsstrong Two different scenarios in a multiple caller scenariop  ul lipstrongOn Prem Serversstrong To me it makes complete sense in this scenario to allow the customer within the authorization server portal to define 1n number of callers, each representing one of their servers which will be making requests. In this scenario there is no shared cache and it would be very difficult if not impossible to allow a shared refreshaccess token. What would happen the first time multiple servers received a 401pli lipstrongWorkerRole Azurestrong In contrast to the On Prem Server config, it would be very difficult to support multiple refreshaccess tokens without some config file wizardry where each scalable unit was aware of its place in line i.e. what instance number it happened to be. In this scenario the customer would have access to shared cache and could implement a concurrent collection or the like to keep track of the current refresh and access token and the first caller to hit a 401 could block the others while the new access token was obtained.pli ul  pstrong Update based on Brices Answer strongp  pWith respect to clientapplication credentials there are in fact both but I wanted to clarify what my current plans are which now include Thanktecture. I used it back in the WSFed v2 I believe days and have not looked at it for OAuth2 but I will.p  pEach customer that has been granted access to the API think of these as the parent accounts who then have many child accounts under them who do not have API access will have a login to the API portal likely Identity 2.0 based wan MVC or Angular front end. In this portal they will be able to manage their account set API version for a particular application amongst other things. Here is where they will be able to create application credentials assuming that dynamic registration is not implemented. They will not be using the Identity 2.0 portal account creds for their clientID. I will most likely be generating these credentials dynamically clientId and secret with some strong random password generation code. p  pThe question heart of the my initial which you touched on was whether I should allow the creation of one and only one client IDsecret and not enforce a one active refreshauth token per clientID constraint OR allow them to create 1N and create a 11 between that particular client IDsecret. p  pIt is very unlikely that I would ever need multiple different permissionsroles for specific customer against a specific application. In other words if CustomerA had the ability to call POST against a specific URI, that will always be true and if it changes it would change for that customer across the board. As a result my plan was to set application specific permissions at the customer level that identity 2.0 portal account I referred to above and that creates an abstraction of sorts if I go with the 1N clientIDsecrets under the account. Each of those clientIDsecrets would inherit those permissions.p  pI am ashamed to admit as I had started crawling down the proverbial rabbit hole that I neglected to consider the possibility of allowing a 1Many relationship between the clientIDsecret and active refreshauth tokens. I kind of had it in my head that they would be tied together and would only ever exist as a pair. In this scenario, if a user had 3 active agents running against the API, the third one to obtain an auth token and as a result a new refresh token would have broken the ability for the other two agents to obtain a new auth token without fully reauthenticating since agent 3s refresh token was the last one granted.p  pIn the 1Many scenario each and every authenticating agent coming from the white listed IP, using the clientIDsecret would get a valid refreshauth token for their own use. This really solves all of the problems I described but reduces the visibility a little on who the caller is or how many callers there really are if they are behind a load balancer.p  pOf course the balance I am trying to strike is that of solid security coupled with a relatively painless implementation for the end user who today is familiar with a keyvaluepair in a json object implementation for authentication and authorization.p

Negative 3737 pI am currently planning the restructuring of a web application to separate the API from the application.  Right now, users log in to the application by entering their operator ID username and password into a standard HTML form and the authentication is done by checking the database table and creating a PHP session handled using codeZendSessioncode. Im not sure how to continue doing this after separating the API.p  pHere is some simplified code to illustrate how things currently workp  precode GET httpsfoo.example.commoduletrips.php if isLoggedIn ampamp isAuthorizedSESSIONgtoperatorID      require viewstrips.php    POST httpsfoo.example.commoduletrips.phpactiontake  ...   this request can come from AJAX, for example if isLoggedIn ampamp isAuthorizedSESSIONgtoperatorID      modelgtassignTripSESSIONgtoperatorID, POST[tripid]  codepre  pObviously this isnt very RESTful, hence the effort to separate the two. This is what I proposed still a work in progressp  precode GET httpsapi.foo.example.comv1.0trips echo jsonencodemodelgtgetAllTrips   POST httpsapi.foo.example.comv1.0tripstripidoperator modelgtassignTripPOST[operatorid], tripid codepre  pI understand that REST is stateless. In this simplified example, only the operator should be able to assign himselfherself a trip. How do I enforce this with the APIp  pIve read many, many questions and articles about authentication with REST APIs and they all talk about OAuthOAuth2 which seems great for authenticating clients of the API via tokens but nothing about authenticating users of the API client or perhaps Im misunderstanding something In my case, my API client is still the web application.p  pMy main question strongHow is the API supposed to determine who the user is Or is it even supposed tostrongp  pAlternatively I have considered doing this in the web applicationp  precode POST httpsfoo.example.commoduletrips.phpactiontake  ...   this request can come from AJAX, for example if isLoggedIn ampamp isAuthorizedSESSIONgtoperatorID       Use cURL to send an HTTP POST request with the appropriate data to      httpsapi.foo.example.comv1.0trips6operator  codepre  pThat seems like unnecessary overhead but a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma4481479404623thats what it looks like in this answera. I thought that after my restructuring I should be doing something like this from the JavaScriptp  precode.ajax     type POST,     url httpsapi.foo.example.comv1.0trips  trip  operator,     data          operatorid 6601      .successfunction       It worked  codepre  pIve looked at a hrefhttpsdeveloper.github.comv3authentication relnofollowGitHub API Authenticationa as an example and the Basic Usage uses codecurl u username ltapiendpointurlgtcode. Im not concerned about using the codeAuthorizationcode HTTP header as this application is already HTTPS only but in this case wouldnt I need to store the password in the locally e.g. Web Storage or somethingp  pIve also read a hrefhttpwww.thebuzzmedia.comdesigningasecurerestapiwithoutoauthauthentication relnofollowthis blog posta and Im not sure if thats what Im supposed to be doing and if so, am I supposed to include the username and password in that hashed blob of datap  pPerhaps I am misunderstanding how APIs are supposed to work in general, if so it would be great for someone to clear that upp

Negative 3737 pSeveral days ago I tried to incorporate Isotope into my site, and combine it with Fancybox 2 to create a nice looking gallery with filteringsorting possibilities. Since many pages contain a lot of images, I prefer to show and append each image directly after it has finished loading rather than showing a loader until all images have been loaded.p  pIn order to achieve this, I came up with this piece of code so farp  precode     function     init isotope     var container  .isotopecontainer.isotope     itemSelector .isotopeimage,     layoutMode fitRows,     transitionDuration 0.7s      reveal initial images container.isotopeImagesRevealimagescontainer.find.isotopeimage   .fn.isotopeImagesReveal  function items     var iso  this.dataisotope  var itemSelector  iso.options.itemSelector    hide by default   items.hide    append to container   this.append items    items.imagesLoaded.progress function imgLoad, image        get item      image is imagesLoaded class, not ltimggt, ltimggt is image.img     var item   image.img .parents itemSelector       unhide item     item.show      isotope does its thing     iso.appended item        return this    codepre  pThe code above already does to some extent what I am after. It pulls the images initially present in the codeltdiv idimagescontainergtcode, and appends an item to isotope once an image has finished loading. The problem however is that the code appends and shows images emin the order they finish loadingem image loaded first becomes 1 in grid, then 2 etc.. Adding the sortby parameter to the isotope options does not work, as the images are not loaded at the point isotope is initiated. Resorting them with isotope after all images have been appended this way is possible, but looks very messy. p  pWhat I would like to achieve is to have the images emloaded in the order they are present in the codeltdiv idimagescontainergtcodeem. Chronologically when it comes to the original document order so to say. So basically start loading image 1, show and append it once it has been loaded. Then proceed to image 2, show and append it after loading, etc. until all images have been processed.p  pI think the solution is to alter the code.fn.isotopeImagesRevealcode function to process each of the div items in chronological order, but I cant figure out how.p  pstrongUpdate added example of current code. a hrefhttpcodepen.iomicksanderspenKwXmwO relnofollowhttpcodepen.iomicksanderspenKwXmwOastrongp

Negative 3737 pI am trying to recreate the calculator app layout in my app. My problem is that I cant get auto layout to work right.

Then for the bottom part warning, I went and codeUpdate Framecode. This works.  p  pFor the buttons I set codeEqual Heightscode for all of them and codeEqual Widthscode for all of them expect the bigger button 0. For the buttons from the upper part again I control drag from them to the label and set codeVerticalcode I dont want any space between them, and I dont know what to set here.

Negative 3737 pI recently started using Jasmine to test Javascript and really enjoy it for testing js logic functions.

Negative 3737 pNobody seems to have this question already so I asked it because Ive spent a few hours trying to debug this and cant find a solutionp  pEssentially, I have a function called codedrawcode, which is declared in my document classp  precodepublic function drawTarget MovieClip,mX int,mY int,lX int,lY intvoid      Target.graphics.clear     Target.graphics.lineStyle1,0x000000,1     Target.graphics.moveTomX,mY     Target.graphics.lineTolX,lY    codepre  pI call it later to draw two lines, on two different MovieClipsp  precodedrawLine,Line.mX,Line.mY,Mirror.x  Mirror.width  2,Line.lY drawnextLine,Mirror.x  Mirror.width  2,200,Mirror.x  Mirror.width  2,0 codepre  pwhere p  precodevar Line MovieClip  new MovieClip var Mirror MovieClip  new mirror codepre  pand codeMirrorcode is draggable, so codeMirror.xcode changes whenever it is dragged. p  pcodeLinecode is a line made using code.graphicscode and Line.mX is equal to the codeLine.graphics.moveTocode X value last time it was modified. codeLine.mYcode is the same, but for the Y coordinate. I set these values by doing thisp  precodeLine.mX  0 Line.mY  200 Line.lX  550  Line.lY  200 codepre  pBut with whatever values I want to draw the line, with codelXcode and codelYcode being equal to the X and Y coordinates of codeLine.graphics.lineTocode. Then I draw codeLinecode using my codedrawcode function like thisp  precodedrawLine,Line.mX,Line.mY,Line.lX,Line.lY codepre  pThen it gets more complex because, actually, codeLinecode is just one line in an array of lines, created like thisp  precodepublic var lines  [line0,line1,line2,line3,line4,line5,line6,line7,line8] codepre  pand each of those lines is created like this with 0 being replaced by the lines number, respectivelyp  precodepublic var line0 MovieClip  new MovieClip codepre  pthen I give each line a number and a name, add them to the stage and hide them like thisp  precodefor eachvar setupLineMovieClip in lines      setupLine.num  lines.indexOfsetupLine     setupLine.name  line  setupLine.num      addChildsetupLine     setupLine.visible  false  codepre  pThen, after making codeline0code visible, because I need to see it at the start, I loop through each line in a function that runs on codeENTERFRAMEcode, and set the value of codenextLinecode to a different value each time I run the loop like thisp  precodefor eachvar LineMovieClip in lines      nextLine  this[line  Line.num  1]  codepre  pWithin that loop, I then loop through a few other arrays, then check for a collision with the selected codeLinecode and another selected MovieClip from another array, which I wont go into or this question will be longer than the code for node.js.p  pSo essentially, if the collision with the two MovieClips is present, I draw the line that I mentioned at the top of my question. But for some reason, although codeLinecode draws correctly, codenextLinecode draws correctly, but a duplicate of it is drawn across the Y axis at 0, and stops where codenextLinecode is on the Y axis codenextLinecode is vertical, so it has the same Y value at the start as at the end.p  pEven stranger, when I try to hide codenextLinecode if the collision with the two MovieClips is no longer present, using this codep  precodenextLine.visible  false codepre  pit only hides the version of codenextLinecode that runs along the top of the stage, which I didnt even intend to create in the start. hrbEDITbhr a hrefhttppastebin.coma5skQkwv relnofollowhere is a link to the current source codeabr a hrefhttpraphaelhennessy.comLightStageLightStage.zip relnofollowHere is a link to the entire project files with the original source code abr copypaste the new source code from the pastebin link to get the new versionp  hr  pThanks in advance,p  pRaphp

Negative 3737 pHello Guys I am trying to solve one problem given on the Hacker Rank. Though the problem is quite simple, I was thinking to solve the problem using some other concepts. p  pThe problem isp  pstrongDesriptionstrongp  pYou are given an integer N. Find the digits in this number that exactly divide N division that leaves 0 as remainder and display their count. For N24, there are 2 digits 2 amp 4. Both of these digits exactly divide 24. So our answer is 2.p  pstrongInput Formatstrongp  pThe first line contains T the number of test cases, followed by T lines each containing an integer N.p  pstrongConstraintsstrong  1T15  0  pI solved the problem earlier by defining variable N as of type long long but that i guess will not be the efficient way to solve the problem.  So i thought why not declare the variable N as an character array. This way we can also use the program to store the number greater then the max limit of long long also rt p  pSay i used the following code p  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltstring.hgt int main      int i,t     char n[20]     scanfd,ampt     whilet                  scanfs,n        int lenstrlenn        int f2,f3,f5,f7,f4,count          f2f3f5f7f4count0       for i0iltleni       int sum0          switchintn[i]                        case 48 break              case 49 countbreak              case 50 ifintn[len1]20       divisibility by 2                                                  countf21                       break              case 51  fori0n[i]0i     divisibility by 3                                                sumintn[i]                                            ifsum30                                                count                          f31                      break             case 52 iff21              divisibility by 4                                               count                         f41                         break             case 53 ifn[len1]5  n[len1]0     divisibility by 5                                                count                          f51                      break             case 54 iff21 ampamp f31          divisibility by 6                                                count                          break                                      case 55  Code for divisibilty by 7             case 56 iff21 ampamp f41     divisibility by 8                          count                           break                                   case 57 iff31        divisibility by 9                                               count                         break                                              printfdn,count          return 0  codepre  pThe program is working fine but the only problem is I am not able to rt the code for divisibility by 7 anu suggestions will be helpful, And also which is the better way to solve the problem , This way in which the variable N is declared as the character array or by declaring the variable N as long long.p  pAny improvements for the above code would also be appreciated  .....p

Negative 3737 pRecently I have found on Google Maps API, RANGEINTERPOLATED address types will return different results for reverse geocoding ie by latlng than by direct geocoding ie by address.p  blockquote   pie Say I am looking for an address of 52 Haven St that sits on a range interpolation of 4456 Haven St.p      pFor reverse geocoding the returned result will be the range 4456 Haven St with a location coordinate at a centralprominent location.p      pHowever when direct geocoding, it will return the approximate location of the exact house, 52 Haven St within that range. Unfortunately the latitude  longitude received is often highly inaccurate and will be located on housesstreets well outside its range.p blockquote  pFor visual consistency, I only really want the ranged address, so if I am direct geocoding an address from another source, my initial idea was to grab the received location coordinates from the geocode and enter it back into the reverse geocoder, thus providing the range value. Unfortunately with RANGEINTERPOLATION being so wildly inaccurate for direct geocoding, it would often end up outside the range.p  pWhen direct geocoding is there a way to make results for RANGEINTERPOLATED addresses consistent with what the reverse geocoder providesp  pThanksp  pExample of the issuep  pGeocode Onp  precode213 Wakefield Street, Adelaide, 5000, SA, Australia codepre  pResultp  precodearray size6   addresscomponents gt      array size6       0 gt          array size3           longname gt string 213 length3           shortname gt string 213 length3           types gt              array size1               ...       1 gt          array size3           longname gt string Wakefield Street length16           shortname gt string Wakefield St length12           types gt              array size1               ...       2 gt          array size3           longname gt string Adelaide length8           shortname gt string Adelaide length8           types gt              array size2               ...       3 gt          array size3           longname gt string South Australia length15           shortname gt string SA length2           types gt              array size2               ...       4 gt          array size3           longname gt string Australia length9           shortname gt string AU length2           types gt              array size2               ...       5 gt          array size3           longname gt string 5000 length4           shortname gt string 5000 length4           types gt              array size1               ...   formattedaddress gt string 213 Wakefield Street, Adelaide SA 5000, Australia length49   geometry gt      array size4       bounds gt          array size2           northeast gt              array size2               ...           southwest gt              array size2               ...       location gt          array size2           lat gt float 34.9280617           lng gt float 138.6100071       locationtype gt string RANGEINTERPOLATED length18       viewport gt          array size2           northeast gt              array size2               ...           southwest gt              array size2               ...   partialmatch gt boolean true   placeid gt string EjEyMTMgV2FrZWZpZWxkIFN0cmVldCwgQWRlbGFpZGUgU0EgNTAwMCwgQXVzdHJhbGlh length68   types gt      array size1       0 gt string streetaddress length14 codepre  pReverse Geocoding on extracted location to receive range of housesp  precodelocation gt          array size2           lat gt float 34.9280617           lng gt float 138.6100071 codepre  pResultp  precodearray size5   addresscomponents gt      array size6       0 gt          array size3           longname gt string 214258 length7           shortname gt string 214258 length7           types gt              array size1               ...       1 gt          array size3           longname gt string Wakefield Street length16           shortname gt string Wakefield St length12           types gt              array size1               ...       2 gt          array size3           longname gt string Adelaide length8           shortname gt string Adelaide length8           types gt              array size2               ...       3 gt          array size3           longname gt string South Australia length15           shortname gt string SA length2           types gt              array size2               ...       4 gt          array size3           longname gt string Australia length9           shortname gt string AU length2           types gt              array size2               ...       5 gt          array size3           longname gt string 5000 length4           shortname gt string 5000 length4           types gt              array size1               ...   formattedaddress gt string 214258 Wakefield Street, Adelaide SA 5000, Australia length53   geometry gt      array size3       location gt          array size2           lat gt float 34.927721           lng gt float 138.609363       locationtype gt string ROOFTOP length7       viewport gt          array size2           northeast gt              array size2               ...           southwest gt              array size2               ...   placeid gt string ChIJW52SL87OsGoRq3QWfApd1m4 length27   types gt      array size1       0 gt string streetaddress length14 codepre  pThe 214258 address range does not cover 213.p

Negative 3737 pId like to call a build script whenever something is pushed to my GitHub repository. Ive set up a small web app that receives the webhook request from GitHub and calls the build script. However, the build script can take up to 5 minutes to finish, breaking the build when another push happens during that time. Normally something like this is handled by a continuous integration server, but in my case that would be overkill. My current solution for this is a Python  wrapper script that uses the existence and modification date of a lock file to determine if the build should be startedp  precodeimport os.path import os import subprocess  LOCKFILE  tmpmywebhook.lock SCRIPT  pathtomybuild.sh   prevent build script running twice if os.path.existsLOCKFILE     os.utimeLOCKFILE, None     exit else     openLOCKFILE, w.close      starttime  0     endtime  os.path.getmtimeLOCKFILE     while starttime lt endtime         try             subprocess.callSCRIPT         finally              if lockfile was modified while the build script ran, run it again             starttime  endtime             endtime  os.path.getmtimeLOCKFILE     os.removeLOCKFILE codepre  pThe script works fine but only because there are not several pushes per second. My questions are p  ol liIs there a better method to do this short of using a CI server li liIf not, can some of the race conditions in the script removed I can see at least 4 race conditions, basically whenever something is done to the lock file.li ol
Negative 3737 pI have a multithreaded PyQt application that is leaking memory.  All the functions that leak memory are worker threads, and Im wondering if theres something fundamentally wrong with my approach.p  pWhen the main application starts, the various worker thread instances are created from the thread classes, but they are not initially started.  p  pWhen functions run that require a worker thread, the thread is initialized data and parameters are passed from the main function, and variables are reset from with in the worker instance, and then the thread is started.  strongThe worker thread does its business, then completes, but is never formally deleted.strongp  pIf the function is called again, then again the thread instance is initialized, started, runs, stops, etc...  p  pBecause the threads can be called to run again and again, I never saw the need to formally delete them.  I originally figured that the same variables were just get reused, but now Im wondering if I was mistaken.p  pDoes this sound like the cause of my memory leak  Should I be deleting the threads when they complete even if theyre going to be called againp  pIf this is the root of my problem, can someone point me to a code example of how to handle the thread deleting process properly  If it matters, Im using PyQt 4.11.3, Qt 4.8.6, and Python 3.4.3p
Negative 3737 pI have two projects one MFC .exe and an MFC .dll. I have an MFC dialog defined in a DLL.

Negative 3737 pIve read several posts on this but nothing that would really answer my question in an uptodate way i.e. UI.insert is depreciated.p  pSo whats the best way of insertingrendering a Template into a Surface reactively, meaning, not only one data object renderWithData, but whatever is defined in the Template.helpers should also be updated reactively. Code tried so farp  precodevar div  document.createElementdiv  UI.insertUI.renderfunction  return Template.hello , div surface  new famous.core.Surface     content Blaze.toHTMLfunction  return Template.hello ,     content div,     content ltdiv classhellgtltdivgt,     size [window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight],     properties ...      Blaze.renderfunction  return Template.hello, .hell[0] codepre  pThese are 3 different approaches Ive tried. First UI.insert inserts it, but handlebarsstyle Helpers are not recognized. Second, toHTML, no reactivity, even when I put everything into a Tracker.autorun. Third, Blaze.render..., doesnt work at all.p  pIs there an easy solution to thisp

Negative 3737 pI understand how to open windows and communicate between the original window that opened the 2nd window and the 2nd window to communicate back to the original window. However, I have a situation where I have original page and page 1. These pages are 2 different PHP scripts that runs as a separate page. p  ppage 1 opens a window with clients webpage inside. We will call this window 1.p  pOriginal page opens window 2 and window 3. These windows loads in php files that hold editing tools. I need these window 2 and window 3 to communicate with original page to edit window 1s content.  I dont see how this is possible. I only seen tutorials and books talking about original page and the windows it creates are the only ones that can access each other. So, I know in theory I cannot have the original page communicate with window 1 because window 1 was created by page 1. p  pIs, there any way to work around this The page 1 opens up content...like images, webpages...etc. I have it already setup this way. I need to be able to have my window tools to access the content window. That way they can edit webpages or images. How can I Do this if its possible p  pNo, that isnt the same question.  I need to modify the document to make changes to the html.  So, using cookies wont solve my problem. I need to edit t he content in the other window that was open by a different webpage but its still part of the same domain. p

I explored the documentation but extending the tablespace is not one of the adjustable privilege of users. pli lipExtending the tablespace by 8 MB is very small in size. I dont think this is a true reason why it fails. There might be other underlying cause.pli ul

Negative 3737 pAs the title says.p  pHistory To reduce flicker in my ListBox with codeDrawMode.OwnerDrawFixedcode and a custom OnDrawItem I used the subclassing example from this page a hrefhttpyacsharpblog.blogspot.no200807listboxflicker.html relnofollowhttpyacsharpblog.blogspot.no200807listboxflicker.htmla which uses codeSetStyleControlStyles.OptimizedDoubleBuffer  ControlStyles.AllPaintingInWmPaint  ControlStyles.UserPaint, truecodep  pIt works well except for one thing When I scroll sideways to see long strings the OnDrawItem does not seem to understand that it should draw with an offset. It seems like the horizontal scroll offset is lost somewhere on the way and the area OnPaint has been called to fill in gets filled in by my OnDrawItem as if the ListBox was not scrolled sideways at all.p  pPlease note If I disable codeControlStyles.UserPaintcode and let the system call OnDrawItem directly, it works fine and I can scroll sideways normally. But it flickers and is too slow to be useful. I need the custom OnPaint and the codeControlStyles.OptimizedDoubleBuffercode to make it smooth.p  pCan someone tell me wherehow to get the horizontal scroll position, or what needs to be done to make this happen automatically, like when the system calls OnDrawItemp

Negative 3737 pI have a Tomcat 8 server that frequently runs out of memory. My guess as to what is occurring is that Tomcat does not limit the number of http sessions in memory, so if you get enough users, then the server will eventually run out of memory.p  pI know you can set a session timeout in your web.xml like so,p  precodeltsessionconfiggt         ltsessiontimeoutgt30ltsessiontimeoutgt ltsessionconfiggt codepre  pBut that does not help if you get a lot of users in 30 minutes. I searched a lot for some way to limit the number of sessions, but surprisingly did not find much info.  Seems like it would be a common issue, as Tomcat by default is guaranteed to run out of memory on high load.p  pSo, how can you set a limit to the number of http sessions, such that Tomcat will expire the oldest when it reaches that limit  That seems like the only logical way to not run out of memory.p

For example a search for codesavvascode returns in order of scorep  precodeFirst name  Last name        Email        Sav           sa.com s      Sa           sas.com Sa                   sa.com   Sa               sa.com sa                     sa.com Sa        ss      sass.com Sa            sa.com Savvas      s         .com Savvas      s         .com Sa         sS  sas.com codepre  pI have replaced characters other than edge ngrams of the search term in the fields with codecode and modified the lengths of email to protect identities.p  pInfact searching for codesssssssssssssssscode although it doesnt exist in my data returns items with the most number of codescode characters in them. Something which I wouldnt expect to happen as I am not doing any manual ngrams to my search.p  pThe issue also appears when I attempt to search for a phone number, I match any emails containing the characters code78code when searching for code782code over phone numbers that have code782code as exact ngrams.p  pIt seems that elasticsearch is also performing the ngrams on my search query and not just the field and comparing the two and somehow favouring shorter matches to greater.p  pHere is my queryp  precode     bool          should [  Any one of these matches will return a result

Only after I had created the child images did I realize that I needed java to be installed across all of them. It would be much easier for me to somehow install java to the base image and have it be propagated to the children, rather than go through each child image and install java.p  pI admit I am new to docker, so is such a thing possible If not, how would you go about modifying several images with the same change in one go Is that possible Thanks.p
Negative 3737 pPython, being the dynamic language that it is, offer multiple ways to implement the same feature. These options may vary in readability, maintainability and performance.

Negative 3737 pIve written a Python script that drives several macros in various Excel files to format some tabdelimited data files a very specific way to be used by another program.

Negative 3737 pIve recently started profiling one of my iOS app written in codeswiftcode and realized how annoying ARC is compared to other more adopted GC like MarkAndSweep.p  pOne of the most prevalent causes for codeStrong Reference Cyclecode was retaining instance property within a closure that is passed to another object retained, again, by the class.p  pFor example,p  precode  class MyClass      private let text  hello world     private let anotherClass  AnotherClass     init        addText           private func addText        anotherClass.addText  return self.text          codepre  pRetain cycle like above can be avoided by passing argument to the method instead of accessing codeselfcode directly.p  precodeclass MyClass    private let text  hello world   private let anotherClass  AnotherClass   init       addTexttext      private func addTexttextString      anotherClass.addText  return text      codepre  pIs the second approach considered a good practicep  pFYI, Im aware that retain cycle like above can be broken using capture list. Im just curious as to patterns that are more resilient to memory leaks.p
