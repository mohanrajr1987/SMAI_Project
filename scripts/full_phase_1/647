Positive 647 pIm sure this is a feature, but I would appreciate any pointershelp on the issue.p  pIm using Spring Boot  JPA Hibernate stack. p  pIf I query for an entity called Homes using JPA, and increment a Calendar field p  precodehomeInstance.getListedDate.addCalendar.DATE, 1, for example codepre  pwith no intention of saving this change back to the database its only for quick intermediary calculations as the several routines run on a list of these entities.p  pThen I call a nativequery using an injected EntityManager bean.p  precodeAutowired EntityManager em ... Query nvqry  em.createNativeQuery... nvqry.getResultList codepre  pDoing this automatically persists the changes made to the entity above which were never supposed to be persisted.p  pIs there a way to disable this feature without losing the inmemory changes I manually persist anything I want using the repository, and as such a whole session persistence is useless for me.p

Positive 647 pI have 2 tables strongcontractsstrong and strongcontractitemsstrong where the latter has a strongforeign keystrong set to the first one.p  pWhen using SQLAlchemy for inserting new data from a list into my postgre database Im basically doing the followingp  precodefor row in list       Get contract and item from row     ...      session.addcontract     session.addcontractitem       Do some select statements which will raise an autoflush     ...  session.commit codepre  pNow... this works for maybe 23 runs, sometimes more, sometimes less. Then the part where an autoflush is executed will end in an exception telling me that strongcontractitemstrong could not be inserted because it has an foreign key to strongcontractstrong and the strongcontractstrong row does not exist yet.p  pIs the order in which I pass the data to the addfunction of the session not the order in which the data will be flushed I actually hoped SQLAlchemy would find the right order in which to flush statements on its own based on the dependencies. It should be clear that the strongcontractitemstrong row should not be inserted before the strongcontractstrong row, when strongcontractitemstrong has a foreign key to strongcontractstrong set. Yet the order seems to be random.p  pI then tried to flush the strongcontractstrong manually before adding strongcontractitemstrongp  precodefor row in list       Getting contract and item from row     ...      session.addcontract     session.flush  Flushing manually      session.addcontractitem       Do some select statements which will raise an autoflush     ...  session.commit codepre  pThis worked without any problems and the rows got inserted into the database.p  pIs there any way to set the order in which statements will be flushed for the session Does SQLAlchemy really not care about dependencies such as foreign keys or am I making a mistake when adding the data Id rather not manage the flushs manually if somehow possible.p  pIs there a way to make SQLAlchemy get the order rightp

Positive 647 pI am working with NHibernate right now, and am coming across a problem trying to improve the data bandwidth efficiency of what im working on.p  pThe context is I am making a data event editor, which has a listview populated with events.

Originally, I was just selecting all the parents and loading the events underneath it, but if you had say 20 parents, then it would run 60 querys or so to load the list.p  pI have changed it now to run just 3 querys, one to select all of each event type between date X and date Y.

Negative 647 pI am a newbie to PInvoke calls.  I have googled this as it seems like a simple enough question but no joy.p  pI am making muliple Windows Mobile API calls in a row to detect if my app is already running and then reactivate it.  Everything works fine and dandy but I wanted to put in logging etc for the times when it doesnt work OK.p  pWhile writing this code I found that I will get error codes even when my calls apparently return a valid result and the valid result is used successfully by a subsequent call proving its valid I think.p  pE.g. I call CreateToolhelp32Snapshot which gives me back a handle to a snapshot of currently running processes.  Calling Marshal.GetLatWin32Error immediatley after returns Error 6 which apparently means Invalid Handle.  But the returned value is used successfully by the subsequent calls to other methods and the whole process works.  Its definitely this particular call that sets Error 6 because if you call Marshal.GetLatWin32Error just before the call it returns 0.p  pCalls to Process32First and Process32Next exhibit similar behaviour i.e. they give me process information happily but sometimes set Error 6.  I think I know this is happening because I call Marshal.GetLatWin32Error immediatley before and after each call and sometimes it is 0 before and 6 after.  Currently I am always getting a successful result either a handle that works with subsequent calls or a value that casts to 1 if int or true if bool and process info successfully copied into my buffer.p  pSo.....should I care  Its all working....  Do I care what error gets set if I get back a result that is used successfully by the rest of the process  My gut says yes I do, surely  Either way, how do I actually know if everything is OK if I apparently get a successful result back but an error code is also set  I am having nightmares about releasing an unstable system that wont be giving me useful error information back........p  pUPDATEp  pThis is the results of my loggong code to try and illustrate what Im talking about for anyone interested.  In brief, the code checks for alreadyrunning copies of itself, then for alreadyrunning copies of the client and then reactivates client if it was found.p  precodeMethod name CreateToolhelp32Snapshot,

I know the age old debate about how you cannot measure performance of developers, but the reality is, at our company there is a need to do that one way or another.p  pI work for a relatively small company small in terms of developers, and management felt the need to measure developer performance based on functionality that passes test QA at first iteration. p  pWe somehow managed to convince them that this was a bad idea for various reasons, and came up instead on measuring developers by putting code in test where all unit tests passes. Since in our team there is no requirement per se to develop unit tests before, we felt it was an opportunity to formalise the need to develop unit tests  i.e. put some incentive on developers to write unit tests.p  pMy problem is this since arguably we will not be releasing code to QA that do not pass all unit tests, how can one reasonably measure developer performance based on unit tests Based on unit tests, what makes a good developer stand outp  ol liFunctionality that fail although unit test passesli liNot writing unit test for a given functionality at all, or not adequate unit tests writtenli liQuality of unit test writtenli liNumber of Unit tests writtenli ol  pAny suggestions would be much appreciated. Or am I completely off the mark in this kind of performance measurement p

Negative 647 pIm pretty new to the manytomany dimensions but I have a scenario to solve, which raised a couple of questions that I cant solve myself So your help would be highly appreciatedp  pThe scenario isp  ol liThere is a parentchild Categories dimension which has a recursive Categories hierarchy with NonLeafDataVisible setli liThere is a regular Products dimension, that slices the fact tableli liThere is a bridge manytomany ProductCategory table which defines the relation between the two. Important to note is that a product can belong to any level of the categories hierarchy  i.e. a particular category can have both  directly assigned products and subcategories.li liThere is a fact Transactions table that holds a FK to the Product that has been sold, as well as a FK to its category. The FK is needed, becauseli ol  pI have all this modeled in BIDS, the dimension usage is set between each of the dimensions and the facts, the manytomany relation between the Categories and the Transactions table is in place is in place.

Hence the result set contains way too much redundant data and besides I cant find a way to filter out the redundancies in the SSRS report itself.p  pAny idea on how to rewrite the MDX so that it only returns the result set abovep  pAnother problem is that if I create a roleplaying Category dimension which I set to slice directly the transactions data, then the numbers that I get when browsing the cube are completely off It seems as SSAS is doing something during processing but its not the SQL statements it shoots to the OLTP, as those remain exactly the same that causes the problem, but Ive no idea what.

Negative 647 pI am looking to write a contact synchronisation application for windows mobile and google contacts.  I am developing against the Windows Mobile 6 platform for the time being and using the PocketOutlook managed classes and C.p  pAn initial problem I have come up with whilst doing some research is the fact that the contacts do not have an accessible last updated date After reading some posts on MS forums one of the suggested approaches is to monitor for contact changes, this does not seem like a good idea on a compact device as there is no OS level ContactUpdated event that i can find and each contact object has an Updated event for each property Working with this if i had 100 contacts each with 10 properties i would be subscribing to 1000 events I have many more contacts and there are many more properties.p  pThere are plenty of synchronisation services for WM6 so there must be a way around this problem, but as of yet I havent come up with one.p  pThere is a Properties collection exposed on the contact under which you can add custom properties but as the standard contact editor in windows mobile will not populate this when editing a contact I cant see how I could use it to my advantage.p  pHas anybody faced this issue before and if so how was this dealt with p  pThe Google objects do have an updated date and I will know the date of the last sync so downloads are fine.p  pThanks in advancep  pOneShotp

Negative 647 pBack couple of months ago I attended a presentation hosted by two representative of an independent software development company. It was mainly about good software design and practices.p  pThe two guys were talking mainly about Java and I remember them saying, that in some circumstances it is very good practice to use getInstanceOf instead of the constructor. It had something to do with making always calling getInstanceOf from different classes rather than constructor and how it was it is much better approach on larger scale projects.p  pAs you can see I cannot remember much from it now  but I remember that the arguments that they used were really convincing. I wonder if any of you ever came across such a design and when, would you say, is it useful Or do you think it isnt at allp
Negative 647 pI have a navigation controller that displays viewcontroller A. There is a right button labelled B that leads to viewcontroller B. p  pNow, when the user makes an important change in the view managed by viewcontroller B, viewcontroller Bs usefulness has ended. p  pFrom then on, VC A should lead to a new VC, viewcontroller C. This is the behavior that I want. However, because viewcontroller A has already been created with a right button leading to B, Im not sure how to get it to reconfigure itself. I want it to now have a right button labeled C which leads to viewcontroller C. p  pI have been unable to find any sample code that addresses a situation like this. To boil the problem down to its essence, I just need to be able to remake viewcontroller A while its in the navcontrollers stack. p

Negative 647 pI have a POST controller action that returns a partial view. Everything seems really easy. but. I load it using code.ajaxcode, setting type as codehtmlcode. But when my model validation fails I thought I should just throw an error with model state errors. But my reply always returns 500 Server error.p  pHow can I report back model state errors without returning Json with whatever result. I would still like to return partial view that I can directly append to some HTML element.p  h2Edith2  pI would also like to avoid returning error partial view. This would look like a success on the client. Having the client parse the result to see whether its an actual success is prone to errors.

Negative 647 pI recently created a WCF service dll and a service host exe. I know my WCF service is working correctly since I am able to successfully add the service to WcfTestClient. p  pHowever, I seem to be running into an issue when I comes to utlizing my WCF from a service host exe. I can add a reference to the WCF dll to my service host exe and create the necessary componets to the exe such as the service installer, service host, and the app.config, compile and then finally install the exe using InstallUtil. But, when I tried to start the service in the Microsoft Management Console, the service immediately stops after being started. p  pSo I began investigating what could exactly be causing this issue an came up with this error from the Application Log in the Event Viewer. p  pDescription p  blockquote   pService cannot be started.   System.InvalidOperationException   Service Service has zero application   noninfrastructure endpoints. This   might be because no configuration file   was found for your application, or   because no service element matching   the service name could be found in the   configuration file, or because no   endpoints were defined in the service   element.p blockquote  pThis error is actually generated in the codeOnStartcode of my exe, when I perform this call codeServiceHost.Opencode. Ive seen numerous posts where other individuals have run into this issue, however most if not all of them, claim that the service name or contract namespace and class name, are not being specified. I checked both of these entries in my config file in the exe as well as in the dll, and they match up PERFECTLY. Ive had other people in the office double check behind me to make sure I wasnt going blind at one point, but of course they came to the same conclusion as me that everything looked like it was specified correctly. I am truly at a lost as to what is going on at this point.  Could anyone help me with this issue p  pAnother thing that came up as a possible reason this may be happening is that the app.config is never being read at least not the one I think should be getting read. Could this be the issue If so, how can I go about addressing this issue. Again, ANY help would be appreciated. p

Negative 647 pIm a newcomer to subversion. Recently, Ive done some development in two different branches, where one of the branches was a branch of the other branch. Ive merged down some changes from the first branch down to the trunk. However, when trying to merge down changes from the other branch to trunk, everything went haywire. That is, Ive had a lot of conflicts, some of which I resolved but not commited and some of which are not. What worse is, a lot of the changes I made to the branch were for some reason not merged into the trunk. Now, my only question is, can I just do a revert on my working copy to return the trunk into its previous state That is, will I mess something up by doing this My taught is to start all over again and do it more carefully by hand.p  pThanxp

Negative 647 pCurrently, my project uses codeEnumeratedEnumType.ORDINALcode, so when I sort by this column, it is ordering based on the order in the codeenumcode, which works fine. But I need to add some additional values to the codeenumcode, which need to be inserted at different locations in the list of enum values and cant be just added to the bottom to maintain the correct sort order. p  pIf I do this, my database will be messed up.

It might be simple but I dont know where to look.p  pThank you.p  hr  pI am sorry, I did solve the issue myself I didnt include this functionp  precode UITableViewCell tableViewUITableView tableView           cellForRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath      NSLogRetain count i, [fullData retainCount]     UITableViewCell cell      [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifiercell]       create a cell     if cell  nil               cell  [[UITableViewCell alloc]                  initWithStyleUITableViewCellStyleDefault                 reuseIdentifiercell]            fill it with content     NSArray current  [[fullData objectForKeyitems] objectAtIndexindexPath.row]     NSString rowLabel  [NSString stringWithFormat, ,[current valueForKeylocalId], [current valueForKeyname]]     cell.textLabel.text  rowLabel     [current release]     cell.accessoryType  UITableViewCellAccessoryDisclosureIndicator       return it     return cell  codepre  pAnd the issue is that I release the current variable each row in the table.

Negative 647 pI am trying to read data files generated by a program originally written in Visual Basic 6 and later rewritten in Java so I can process them using my own tools.p  pThe program in question is public domain software created by the U.S. Government there is no license agreement that prohibits this. I cannot mention the programs name or link to its web site because the programmer probably would change the obfuscation in next years version, and I would have to repeat my reverse engineering effort.p  pThe underlying data file format is text based, and the obfuscation is some kind of stream cipher with a hardcoded key. I can XOR data files together to get some of the data out filling one of the string fields with a repeating ASCII character, but I would like to avoid embedding the entire keystream within my program.p  pSearching through the .exe file reveals a call to a subroutine named RC4ini and a string that I believe is the key it does not appear anywhere in the user interface. I found what could be the source code to this encryption library on a hrefhttpweb.archive.orgweb20100605102558httpwww.planetsourcecode.comvbscriptsShowCode.asptxtCodeId1736amplngWId1 relnofollowPlanet Source Codea, made the correct changes to a working implementation of RC4 in JavaScript, as that is the programming language I mostly work in, and tried using it.p  pI attempted to search for the encrypted data at every offset in the file, but I did not succeed in decryption.

Same goes for if I bring it into the window from the bottom.  The problem does not exist when I do from the right side though.  I questioned if it was just my program so I went to the MSDN website and even compiled and tried their program httpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryff38140928vVS.8529.aspx.  Same Problem So then I started experimenting with the WMSETCURSOR message and cursor functions but got nowhere. Does anyone have any explanation to this and what I could do to fix it  Any help would be greatly appreciated. p
Negative 647 pI am attempting to connect to a python twisted socket server with Flash using XMLSocket. The connect works fine, and so does the receive. However I cant send data to the server.p  pIs there a specific format I should be using The reason I ask is because I couldnt read any data with the XMLSocket until the data was in the form something0, that is, the data string had to be valid xml followed by the null character. Is there a trick to sending datap  pI dont think this a cross site security problem, because if it was, I believe I wouldnt be able to connect or receive.p  pI am able to connect to the server using telnet and a java client without issues.p  pEDIT I figured it out, the problem was my server needed to have the data sent to it end with rn.p

Negative 647 pFor example, if a request succeeds, I will return a View ,if not, return a String indicating error message and set the contenttype to either xml or json. And the JavaScript XHR call back methods will do the job of either redirecting to another page View or staying in the same page and showing error info. p  pBased on what I read, seems like I should use void as the return type for handler methods. Check this out void if the method handles the response itself by writing the response content directly, declaring an argument of type ServletResponse  HttpServletResponse for that purpose or if the view name is supposed to be implicitly determined through a RequestToViewNameTranslator not declaring a response argument in the handler method signature.Spring Framework reference. p  pWhat I dont understand is what  the view name is supposed to be implicitly determined through a RequestToViewNameTranslator not declaring a response argument in the handler method signature means Any anyone give me an examplep
Negative 647 pSomething that has been bugging me since I read an answer on another stackoverflow question the precise one eludes me now where a user stated something like strongIf youre calling the Service Locator, youre doing it wrong.strongp  pIt was someone with a high reputation in the hundred thousands, I think so I tend to think this person might know what theyre talking about. Ive been using DI for my projects since I first started learning about it and how well it relates to Unit Testing and what not. Its something Im fairly comfortable with now and I emthinkem I know what Im doing. p  pHowever, there are a lot of places where Ive been using the Service Locator to resolve dependencies in my project. Once prime example comes from my ModelBinder implementations.p  pExample of a typical model binder.p  precodepublic class FileModelBinder  IModelBinder      public object BindModelControllerContext controllerContext,                             ModelBindingContext bindingContext          ValueProviderResult value  bindingContext.ValueProvider.GetValueid          IDataContext db  Services.Current.GetServiceltIDataContextgt         return db.Files.SingleOrDefaulti gt i.Id  id.AttemptedValue       codepre  pemnot a real implementation  just a quick exampleemp  pSince the ModelBinder implementation requires a new instance when a Binder is strongfirststrong requested, its impossible to use Dependency Injection on the constructor for this particular implementation.p  pIts this way in a lot of my classes. Another example is that of a Cache Expiration process that runs a method whenever a cache object expires in my website. I run a bunch of database calls and what not. There too Im using a Service Locator to get the required dependency.p  pAnother issue I had recently that I posted a question on here about was that all my controllers required an instance of IDataContext which I used DI for  but emoneem action method required a different instance of IDataContext. Luckily Ninject came to the rescue with a named dependency. However, this felt like a kludge and not a real solution.p  pI thought I, at least, understood the concept of Separation of Concerns reasonably well but there seems to be something fundamentally wrong with how I understand Dependency Injection and the Service Locator Pattern  and I dont know what that is.p  pThe way I currently understand it  and this could be wrong as well  is that, at least in MVC, the ControllerFactory looks for a Constructor for a Controller and calls the Service Locator itself to get the required dependencies and then passes them in. However, I can understand that not all classes and what not have a Factory to create them. So it seems to me that some Service Locator pattern is acceptable...but...p  ol liWhen is it not acceptableli liWhat sort of pattern should I be on the look out for when I should rethink how Im using the Service Locator Patternli liIs my ModelBinder implementation wrong If so, what do I need to learn to fix itli liIn another question along the lines of this one user a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers126014markseemannMark Seemanna recommended an Abstract Factory  How does this relateli ol  pI guess thats it  I cant really think of any other question to help my understanding but any extra information is greatly appreciated.p  pI understand that DI might not be the answer to everything and I might be going overboard in how I implement it, however, it seems to work the way I expect it to with Unit Testing and what not.p  pIm not looking for code to fix my example implementation  Im looking to learn, looking for an explanation to fix my flawed understanding.p  pemI wish stackoverflow.com had the ability to save draft questions. I also hope whoever answers this question gets the appropriate amount of reputation for answering this question as I think Im asking for a lot. Thanks, in advance.emp

The C preprocessor has some very good uses defining constants, perhaps, or including header files. But there are also certain things that are considered harmful, in particular using the preprocessor as a tool to do the work of a function whilst sidestepping the overhead of using a function. The preprocessor has an important place, but if you have a choice between implementing something via preprocessor macros and implementing it as a function, chances are you should be using a function, not the preprocessor.p  pAre there any gotchas like that for using SASSp

Negative 647 pIve read a bunch of articles and readings on ObjectiveC delegates, trying to understand them.  Coming from Java, they seem very much like Java listeners.  For example, lets say I had a button in Java.  When the button is pushed, I want something to happen.  My code might look something like thisp  precodeButtonListener myButtonListener  new ButtonListener     someButton.addActionListenermyButtonListener ...  class ButtonListener implements ActionListener     public void actionPerformedActionEvent e            codepre  pSomething like that.  In objectivec it seems that I would do something along the lines of calling a setDelegate method for my button and passing it the listener as a delegate.  The actual button class would then probably check if that delegate responded to some selector ie. actionPerformed.  If Im thinking about this the right way, it does seem like delegates are just like listeners.  Is that correct  Are there any major differencesp  pThanksp

Negative 647 pI was thinking of adding a simple bandwidth monitor to a console application and I was wondering if it would be possible to keep a line in the console window visible at all times. I could set something up manually to pass new console output into a method that would get the contents of the console, clear the console, add the bandwidth data on the first row, then rewrite each line of previous information back to the console, etc.. but that seems like a really hacky way to go about it, and Id be limited to the amount of rows visible at once in the console window no scrolling.p  pAny idea  Any built in functionality for this   Examplep  precodeSTATS Downloaded 2599b, Uploaded 754b  lt this always stays at the top    constantly changing text constantly changing text constantly changing text constantly changing text constantly changing text constantly changing text constantly changing text constantly changing text constantly changing text constantly changing text constantly changing text constantly changing text codepre

From what I know RSC is an ancestor of CVS.

Locking files and releasing them only after end of editing them, is not the way we want to go.  Now as we can reverse changes on a single file reverting it to given revision number and so repair our or others faults, there is need for that.br So I striked out the first point on my list note its not written down in descending priority order, and thank thiton to remind me that.p

When I have a lot of request, the strongLoad Balancerstrong should create new instance to serve the clients web request.p  pCould someone explain me how can I proceed with these requirements to achieve good scalabilityp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pBased on the comment from dtuckernet below, this task can automatically be handle by using Elastic beanstalk. Any ideas on how to do it manually in Java such as initializing the cloudwatch, ELB, and autoscale, and set an alarm to monitor the cpu usage I know that this is possible, as amazon actually have java API for that. However I couldnt find any example code on the Amazon website that relates to Cloudwatch, ELB, and autoscale. I just wanna practice with the underlying infrastructures to have a thorough understanding on that, instead of using the Amazon Elastic beanstalk.p

The restlet tries to get its results directly from the network proxy, which doesnt know any codelocalhostcode and forbids the call to code127.0.0.1code.p  pAnother critical point is, that the error was always replicable, except during one try.

The push would be via long polling  reverse ajax  comet or some other similar method. p  pDo any frameworks such as this exist, and if not, would it be a useful pattern Id be specifically interested in implementations in C  Javascript on the client or maybe NodeJS on the backend.  p  pAlternatively, are there any MVC frameworks or implementations that provide controllers which push data to the client using technologies such as Cometp

Negative 647 pAbstract Descriptionp  pI have a set of strings, call it the active set, and a set of sets of strings  call that the possible set.  When a new string is added to the active set, sets from the possible set may suddenly be subsets of the active set because the active set lacked only that string to be a superset of one of the possibles.  I need an algorithm to efficiently find these when I add a new string to the active set.  Bonus points if the same data structure allows me to efficiently find which of these possible sets are eminvalidatedem no longer a subset when a string is emremovedem from the active set.p  pThe reason I framed the problem described below in terms of sets and subsets of strings in the abstract above is that the language Im writing this in Io is dynamically typed.  Objects do have a type field but it is a string with the name of the object type in it.p  pBackgroundp  pIn my game engine I have emGameObjectsem which can have several types of emRepresentationem objects added to them.  For instance if a GameObject has physical presence it might have a PhysicsRepresentation added to it or not if its not a solid object.  It might have various kinds of GraphicsRepresentations added to it, such as a mesh or particle effect and you can have more than one if you have multiple visual effects attached to the same game object.p  pThe point of this is to separate subsystems, but you cant completely separate everything  for instance when a GameObject has both a PhysicsRepresentation and a GraphicsRepresentation, something needs to create a 3rd object which connects the position of the GraphicsRepresentation to the location of the PhysicsRepresentation.  To serve this purpose while still keeping all the components separate, I have emInteractionem objects.  The Interaction object encapsulates the crosscutting knowledge about how two system components have to interact.p  pBut in order to protect GameObject from having to know too much about Representations and Interactions, GameObject just provides a generic registry where Interaction prototype objects can register to be called when a particular combination of Representations is present in the GameObject.  When a new Representation is added to the GameObject, GameObject should look in its registry and activate just those Interaction objects which are newly enabled by the presence of the new Representation, plus the existing Representations.p  pIm just stuck on what data structure should be used for this registry and how to search it.p  pErratap  pThe sets of strings are not necessarily sorted, but I can choose to store them sorted.p  pAlthough an Interaction most commonly will be between two Representations, I do not want to limit it to that I should be able to have Interactions that trigger with 3 or more different representations, or even interactions that trigger based on just 1 representation.p  pI want to optimize this for the case of making it as fast as possible to addremove representations.p  pI will have many active sets each game object has an active set, but I have only one possible set the set of all registered interaction types.  So I dont care how long it takes to build the data structure that represents the possible set, because it only needs to be done once provided the algorithm for comparing different active sets is nondestructive of the possible set data structure.p

Negative 647 pIm fairly new to Objectify, and I had a quick question for  the best way to do somethingp  pLets say I have an application that allows people to send and receive  messages think email for simplicity. When my app loads, I dont  want to load every single message from every single contact thats  sent a message to a given user. That would be a waste.  Instead, I want to load all of the contacts that a user has messages  from read or unread so that I can display a list of the contacts on  my app, and when the user clicks on a given contact I want to load all  of the messages from that contact to display to the user. p  pI cant find a good way of doing this without loading all of the Messages for an account.  I read the Objectify wiki on manytoone relationships, and I still cant think of  a good way to do this that isnt extremely inefficient. It would seem for the way that the objectify site recommends, that I would have to load all of the messages for a given user, and then parse them for unique contacts.p  pIm trying to use as few App Engine Reads, and Writes as possible, and where  possible Im trying to use Smalls instead of Reads Overall cost to  run my app is a big concern of mine while Im making this. p  pOn Objectify, how should I be doing this p

When I force my code to only use question.T for example to display questions then the order is just fine, but when I get to Radio,Select,Checkbox blocks which all have inner answer blocks ordering seems to be no longer there. So my assumption would be its something to do with the template structure. Funny thing is, when I swap blocks order in template question.R being first the result is that all Radio questions are being displayed first then text fields. So it seems like the order in the template child blocks somehow matters but dont know why.p  pHas anyone stumbled upon such behaviourp

Negative 647 pI have a php script which is called by a javascript XHR function. In this script it accesses the Facebook API using a token which is parsed from a Facebook redirect after accepting to connect to facebook.p  pWhen I add a progress event to the XHR object, it never runs, and when I log the readystates it gets to, only 2 and 4 are called. I dont think its necessarily a problem with my code, my only guess is that in my PHP script it gets the file contents of codehttpsgraph.facebook.commealbumslimit0ampaccesstoken  tokencode which json decodes its contents to use as an object which is looped through, adding each of the users albums to a database doesnt like the fact that I am visiting another url inside this XHR request.p  pCan anyone give me some guidance so I can make my progress bar loadp  pThanksp

Negative 647 pIm pretty new to powershell, so I wont be surprised at all if Im going about this all wrong. Im trying to create a function that, when executed, prints results formatted as a table.

Negative 647 pThis is something Ive encountered a few times and havent been able to find a satisfying answer yet. This seems pretty stupid, but after googling this for a while I couldnt come up with something good.p  pLets say I have a class with 20 instance variables, each of which is optional will be initialized or not.p  pNow I want my constructors to handle all the cases, in case of a few instance variables its fine and I can just create constructors with different signatures, but here I have 20, so I would need strong2201,048,576strong constructors to handle all the cases  That seems ... not very optimal, dont you agreep  pSo since with this brute force approach I basically have to construct 2n constructors, where n is the number of instance variables, I want to find a better way to do it.p  pIve seen a couple solutions for this problem, but I believe they all on assumptions on the data, but in my case each of these variables can be initialized or not at random, I have no way of knowing that before initialization.p  pIm looking for some design patterns or ideas that I could apply to make my code a bit more ... maintainable no dont worry I didnt create 1M constructors p  pThanks.p

Negative 647 pI searched and read thru the Diamond and virtualinheritance questions here, but could not find an answer. My thinking is that this situation is a little unusual, and I am willing to entertain the ideas that my requirements are somewhat off. On the other hand, I think this should be doable in a nice way.p  pThe situation and the requirementsp  pI have a C class library over which I have no control, and which I cannot change. It defines a codeWindowcode class. The codeWindowcode class has a protected member say codehandlecode, not otherwise accessible, that derived classes are meant to use. codeWindowcode defines hundreds well, a very large number... of methods which I dont care to reimplement by delegating in a decorator, say.p  pI want to add functionality to codeWindowcode, so that derived classes which I write say codeLogWindowcode automatically have. An example of such functionality is the ability to snap windows to each other. In order to implement this I need access to codeWindowcodes protected codehandlecode member.p  pFor my reallife purpose this is enough, and the solution is simple derive codeSnappableWindowcode from codeWindowcode, and derive all my codeWindowcodederived classes codeLogWindowcode in this example from codeSnappableWindowcode.p  pHowever, what I would emreallyem want, and is prettier IMHO, isp  ol liThe ability to have this Snappable functionality as a standalone piece of code, which I can choose to plug into any other codeWindowcodederived class, or not.li liThe ability to extend this notion to other functionalities as well, for example the ability to minimize windows. So I could have a codeWindowcodederived class, with or without the Snappable ability, and with or without the Minimizable ability.li liThe implementations of SnappableWindow and MinimizableWindow both need access to codeWindowcodes codehandlecode protected member.li liI would like Snappable and Minimizable to be part of the actual class declaration, so that my actual class codeLogWindowcode is a Window, is a SnappableWindow, and is a MinimizableWindow.li ol  p... and now to the questionp  pI get how I can do this with declaring codeSnappableWindowcode and codeMinimizableWindowcode as emnotem deriving from codeWindowcode but rather getting a codehandlecode in their constructor, and then deriving codeLogWindowcode from codeWindowcode and from any combination of codeSnappableWindowcode and codeMinimizableWindowcode.p  pEDIT codehandlecode is initialized, in codeWindowcode, halfway thru LogWindows constructor, after it has called codeWindowcodes init. and not half way thru codeWindowcodes constructor, as Ive said before.p  pemHoweverem, since codehandlecode is only initialized half way thru codeLogWindowcodes constructor after it has called codeWindowcodes codeinitcode , I cant pass is to codeSnappableWindowcode and codeMinimizableWindowcode as part of codeLogWindowcodes constructor initialization list. Rather, I would have to explicitly call some codeinitcode method on both, passing it the codehandlecode. And this, in each of my codeWindowcodederived classes. codeLogWindowcode, codeSearchWindowcode, codePreferencesWindowcode, etc.p  pI am looking for a way to be able to do something likep  blockquote   pclass LogWindow  public Window, public SnappableWindow, public MinimizableWindowp blockquote  p... and not have to implement anything else inside codeLogWindowcode. Ive fiddled with virtual inheritance, but cant quite come up with the solution.p

Negative 647 pLately, weve been getting hit with the error codeTransaction ABORTed due to Deadlockcode when we go to update a record in one of our tables.  Something is placing a lock on this table and its not being released, but I have spent literal work days trying to track it down and it eludes me still.p  pWhile the error is random, I do know what repetive cycle of steps I need to repeat in order to eventually trigger it.  However, Ive queried dbc.DBQLogTbl and looked at all the SQL thats been executed 2 minutes before and after the error occurs and nothing appears to be selecting from any table without an access lock.  Furthermore, after the error occurs, I will hit F5 repost the web form back to the server to repeat the exact same set of updates and it will work.p  pMy hunch is that some process outside our ASP.NET application is locking the table since Ive checked all the SQL thats being executed by our application.  I think there has to be a way to find out what specific SQL has been executed that has placed locks on a table.p  pstrong892012 Additional infostrong  All of the following is occuring in this order within the same transaction based on what I am seeing when querying codedbc.DBQLogTblcode and ordering by codefirststeptimecodep  ul liupdate employee tableli lilocking row for access select  from employeesecurity where empid  X do this to get current employee record to see if anything has changedli liif there is a change, update aforementioned employeesecurity recordli liupdate employeeconfig table deadlock error always occurs hereli ul  pI didnt mention this before, but the deadlock error is occurring on a table that I am not selecting from at all.

We do not use codelocking row for accesscode when querying the view itself.li ul  pAs far as handling the deadlock, Id rather not have the code just try to resubmit it as this seems like a problem that needs to be fixed.  As you said, Rob, its possible that my access to codedbc.DBQLogTblcode is limited, so perhaps I just cannot see everything that is occurring.

Subversion runs this hook by invoking a program  script, executable, binary, etc. named precommit for which  this file is a template, with the following ordered arguments     [1] REPOSPATH   the path to this repository    [2] TXNNAME     the name of the txn about to be committed     [STDIN] LOCKTOKENS  the lock tokens are passed via STDIN.     If STDIN contains the line LOCKTOKENSn the n denotes a    single newline, the lines following it are the lock tokens for    this commit.  The end of the list is marked by a line containing    only a newline character.     Each lock token line consists of a URIescaped path, followed    by the separator character , followed by the lock token string,    followed by a newline.   The default working directory for the invocation is undefined, so  the program should set one explicitly if it cares.   If the hook program exits with success, the txn is committed but  if it exits with failure nonzero, the txn is aborted, no commit  takes place, and STDERR is returned to the client.   The hook  program can use the svnlook utility to help it examine the txn.   On a Unix system, the normal procedure is to have precommit  invoke other programs to do the real work, though it may do the  work itself too.       NOTE THE HOOK PROGRAM MUST NOT MODIFY THE TXN, EXCEPT        FOR REVISION PROPERTIES like svnlog or svnauthor.        This is why we recommend using the readonly svnlook utility.    In the future, Subversion may enforce the rule that precommit    hooks should not modify the versioned data in txns, or else come    up with a mechanism to make it safe to do so by informing the    committing client of the changes.  However, right now neither    mechanism is implemented, so hook writers just have to be careful.   Note that precommit must be executable by the users who will  invoke it typically the user httpd runs as, and that user must  have filesystemlevel permission to access the repository.   On a Windows system, you should name the hook program  precommit.bat or precommit.exe,  but the basic idea is the same.   The hook program typically does not inherit the environment of  its parent process.  For example, a common problem is for the  PATH environment variable to not be set to its usual value, so  that subprograms fail to launch unless invoked via absolute path.  If youre having unexpected problems with a hook program, the  culprit may be unusual or missing environment variables.    Here is an example hook script, for a Unix binsh interpreter.  For more examples and prewritten hooks, see those in  the Subversion repository at  httpsvn.apache.orgreposasfsubversiontrunktoolshookscripts and  httpsvn.apache.orgreposasfsubversiontrunkcontribhookscripts   REPOS1 TXN2   Make sure that the log message contains some text.

Negative 647 pmy question is hypothetical, I have no produced code to work with yet.p  pI have a web page with a centred grid, arranged using jQuery Masonry. My problem is one of aesthetics. Because masonry centres the grid, which is purposeful, the grid is often significantly thinner than the parent container, and so it does not align too well with elements in the header and footer. Similarly, sometimes the grid is allowed to expand beyond the width of the header, which looks even worse. p  pI have looked into using a script to resize fluid columns, though my grid contains images and the results were not nice. I am now thinking of, maybe a there is a small script which can detect and fetch the width of the masonry container at any single time, codegridcode the width is dynamic of course and displayed inline such as codeltdiv idgrid classmasonry styleheight 408px position relative width 1368pxgtcode and then apply this same width to codeheadercode, codefootercode, and whatever else is requried to make the whole thing line up according to the grid width.p  pAny suggestions Thanks in advancep
Negative 647 pI have a big layout that contains widgets and layouts of the following structurep  precodeQVBoxLayout   QTableView   QPushButton codepre  pI set the margins, padding, and spacing on the layout to 0. The way this renders on Mac OS X, the button doesnt fill all of its space. Instead, there is some padding around it. Magically, the layout seems to know this, and makes sure the table view is exactly as wide as the button is widep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comeVRDq.png altMagic padding caused by QPushButtonp  pWhen I remove the button, the table view returns to its full widthp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com8ec2p.png altNo magic padding herep  pHow can I change it so the button, as well as the table view, become as wide as the layoutp  pIve played with stylesheets padding and margin, and while I can use those to make the button wider, the extra padding around the tree view remains. The only solution I have so far is to wrap the button in another widget, and then set its margin and padding to 0 via stylesheet, but then I lose the rounded look.p

Negative 647 pI want to animate a view sliding up and in.

Id like to have it initially hidden. For example, Id like its top y coordinate to be the bottom pixel of the screen to start.p  pWhen I click a button elsewhere in the UI, Id like foo to slide up, and end when its bottom edge touches the bottom of the screen.p  pWhen I click another button, Id like foo to slide down, back to its original starting position where its top edge is at the bottom pixel of the screen.p  pIm trying to do that with the following animation definitionsp  precode slide up ltset   xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid   androidinterpolatorandroidanimaccelerateinterpolatorgt   lttranslate     androidfromYDelta100     androidtoYDelta0     androidduration700     androidfillBeforetrue     androidfillAftertruegt   lttranslategt ltsetgt   slide down ltset   xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid   androidinterpolatorandroidanimaccelerateinterpolatorgt   lttranslate     androidfromYDelta0     androidtoYDelta100     androidduration700     androidfillBeforetrue     androidfillAftertruegt   lttranslategt ltsetgt codepre  pSo my understanding  if I apply the slideup animation, foo should reposition itself at 100 y, since fillBefore is true. It should then animate up to its original position, and stay there afterwards, since fillAfter is true. The slide down animation works similar. p  pBut its not working, the view seems to jump around.

Heres the code I have at the momentp  precode    lt Dir[appviewspartialsshow.html.erb].each do f1 gt         lt aFile  File.openf1, r gt         lt if aFile gt             lt content  aFile.sysread20 gt             ltpgtlt content gtltpgt         lt else gt             lt Unable to open file gt         lt end gt     lt end gt codepre  pI also think Im opening the entire partial in memory  Wondering If I can just read up until I find my h1 tag then close file and move on  Again Im only reading first 20 characters because I havent yet grasped a way to search for the first h1 tag.p  pIll make edits as I work through the open, parse, piece... I appreciate any guidance and direction you can offer. Thanksp  pstrongEDITstrong Based on comments below there may be a far better way to accomplish my task.  So Im providing some additional background to get direction on other solutions.p  pThis is for a slide show based on partials in a directory.  The slide show is controlled with a navigation element  which I would like to populate by the h1 tags in the partials.  Im not going to manually enter these things every time a change is made  I want the end user to simply drag and drop partials into a directory with a certain name convention and h1 tag description for navigation and let the slide show do everything else.p  pI could impose a class on the h1 tag forNavigation and on the content sliderContent and then use jquery to create a post load codeltulgtcode but that doesnt seem right.  Plus theyll all be part of the same rendered div.p  pI guess Im not clear why reading the first 50 characters of a partial, copying whats in the h1 tags, and putting it in a  isnt the most elegant solutionp  pLike I said, above does everything needed except copy and print whats between the first h1 tag... With an xml parser or some regexp itll be done.  Im just no good with parsing files.p  pPlease let me know other methods to approach this.  Right now I still think its best to parse the partial with or without rendering and put what I need where I want it as needed.p  pThanks.p

From my knowledge it will look something like thisp  precode if adjenpos  1  boostbtnout  mapboostbtnin, 0, 1023, 0, 51  else if adjenpos  2  boostbtnout  mapboostbtnin, 0, 1023, 0, 102  else if adjenpos  3  boostbtnout  mapboostbtnin, 0, 1023, 0, 153  else if adjenpos  4  boostbtnout  mapboostbtnin, 0, 1023, 0, 204  else if adjenpos  5  boostbtnout  mapboostbtnin, 0, 1023, 0, 255  codepre  pNow with option 3, taking a button which has an onoff value of 0 or 153, I want to ramp the value 0 to 153 over a prescribed rate, instead of just on or off.p  pMy assumption is to do something similar to this inside the loopp  precodeboostramp  1 boostbtnvalue  analogReadboostbtnout  analogWriteboostbtn, boostbtnvalue  if  boostpwr lt boostbtnout  boostpwr  boostpwr  boostramp codepre  pI know this is not correct, but how do I inject the new mapped values into a rampped type of functionp  pThanksp

Negative 647 pIm building a browser based app in Python with the help of Jinja2 and would like to add a dialog box to each item in a list of files. For example, my PythonJinja2 generates the following HTMLp  precodeltdiv iddialoggtUnique data goes here.ltdivgt ... ltli classuiwidgetcontentgtsomething.pdfltligt  ltli classuiwidgetcontentgtsomething else.zipltligt  ltli classuiwidgetcontentgtsomething else1.zipltligt ... codepre  pI would like each codeltligtcode to be a callout to the Javascript that shows the dialog box, and for each dialog box to contain unique information related to the file in the list. This list is everchanging too. Here is the JS code I have so far, but this only brings up the first item in the list for each codeltligtcode tagp  precode.fx.speeds.default  1000 function       dialog .dialog         autoOpen false,         show slide,         hide fade       document.readyfunction   selectable.childrenli.eachfunction        this.mouseoverfunction           this.cssbackgroundcolor,FECA40              this.mouseoutfunction           this.cssbackgroundcolor,white              this.clickfunction           dialog.dialog open            return false          codepre  pI am very new to Javascript and am completely lost on this one. The only way I can think to accomplish this is to assign a unique codeidcode to each codeltdivgtcode and then create a corresponding function for each codeidcode. Since the list is upwards of 300 files, that doesnt seem too smart of an idea. What is the best way to give each codeltligtcode tag its own unique dialog box Thanksp

Negative 647 pIm working with a library that I have to provide an InputStream and a PrintStream. It uses the InputStream to gather data for processing and the PrintStream to provide results. Im stuck using this library and its API cannot be altered.p  pThere are two issues with this that I think have related solutions.p  pFirst, the data that needs to be read via the InputStream is not available upfront. Instead, the data is dynamically created by a different part of the application and given to my code as a String via method call. My codes job is to somehow allow the library to read this data through the InputStream provided as I get it.p  pSecond, I need to somehow get the result that is written to the PrintStream and send it to another part of the application as a String. This needs to happen as immediately after the data is put in to the PrintStream as possible.p  pWhat it looks like I need are two stream objects that behave more or less like buffers. I need an InputStream that I can shove data in to whenever I have it and a PrintStream that I can grab its contents whenever it has some. This seems a little awkward to me, but Im not sure how else to do it.p  pIm wondering if anything already exists that allows this kind of behavior or if there is a different better solution that will work in the situation Ive described. The only thing I can come up with is to try to implement streams with this behavior, but that can become complicated fast especially since the InputStream needs to block until data is available.p  pAny ideasp  pstrongEditstrong To be clear, Im not writing the library. Im writing code that is supposed to provide the library with an InputStream to read data from and a PrintStream to write data to.p

Negative 647 pI am trying to test an Android application through the Eclipse plugin on a real device. It is a Samsung Infuse 4G. I believe I have followed all steps on the Android page for testing on devices.p  pFirst of all, I cannot figure out what the Android OS version is because it does not show up in the settings. I can see that the firmware version is 2.2.1, so I assume I am running that version of Android OS as well.p  pNext, when I connect the device to my computer running Vista, 64 bit, I get prompted with three options Kies firmware update, Media player, and Mass storage. When I look on the Internet, I see that I am supposed to select Charge only, but this does not appear in the options with which I am prompted. I have already set USB Debugging to true through Settings  Applications  Development. p  pThird, I have installed the correct driver from the Samsung site based on my model number SGHI997, yet when I do adb devices from my platformtools directory I have tried adb killserver and adb startserver, I still do not get my device listed.p  pI am not very advanced in terms of working with Android and have been banging my head against the wall on how to solve this problem, so any and all help guiding me through this would be appreciated.p  pThanksp
Negative 647 pI have developed an MVC4 Code First application which is on a secure server environment, it takes information from forms and processes them.p  pA new requirement has come along to have some publicexternal forms submit to this and Im looking for the best approach.p  pThe Form Models are quite complicated and deep, with plenty of inheritance.p  pIt has been stated that the security of the information in the existing internal side is paramount.  p  pSo to get data into it I was looking at creating a WCF web service to submit the public forms directly into the internal side, it can only submit.  That way we arent arent risking exposing existing internal data via the public web server.  I need to use the Object Models from the internal side, as some are the same, albeit slightly expanded.  Eg. My MasterForm model, from which all other forms inherit.  And the master person type, from which the different types of people referenced in the forms are inherited from.p  pIs that a good approach or is there a better wayp  pThis is where Im currently at.... and not getting far. Apologies if icons etc arent what youd usually expect, but hopefully you get the idea I have no Visio img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comibsN9.jpg altCurrent ideap  pIn taking this approach so far Ive ran into difficulties with the inherited models when serialisingde serialising it is unable to determine.  I tried a WCF Data Service hosted along side the WebService to submit a form, but it would not let me use the models from the Data Service to submit over the WCF Form submissions WebService.p

Negative 647 pIve got several Threads with queues of objects that theyre processing, while another thread reads and creates these objects from various input. There are certain objects that have to be processed by a specific thread, where as others can be processed by any free thread thus the reason for not using one queue for all of them, but I still want to keep the loads reasonably balanced. I have an array with all of the ConcurrentQueues that each of the threads use and Id like to order them based on their count. Since most of the time the queues will be nearly sorted, Insertion Sort would perform well here.p  pEdit For those asking, Im writing my own because according to a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary6tf1f0bcvvs.100.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary6tf1f0bcvvs.100.aspxa This method uses the QuickSort algorithm, and I want an insertion sortp  pI used a hrefhttpen.literateprograms.orgInsertionsortVisualBasic.NET relnofollowhttpen.literateprograms.orgInsertionsortVisualBasic.NETa to give me a hand, but I dont really trust myself.

Negative 647 pIm using Sencha Architect for developing a Sencha 2 mobile application.  I would like to have a List with two dividers.

If this thread needs to be moved to an alternate site, please let me know...p  pWe write a lot of reports using the Microsoft Reporting framework, mainly RDLC. After we upgraded to VS2012 from VS2008, I can no longer create or open RDLCs. When I try to add a new report from the Add New Item menu, its not even an option. We do have DevExpress reporting installed, and I can create a new report using the DX engine, but thats not what need here. From everything I have read, reporting is core to VS and not an option, so it needs to be installed. Had we been using SSRS, then I understand we need to install reporting from the SQL installation, and not VS, but again thats not the case. We have already tried uninstalling and reinstalling VS2012, performing repairs of VS2012, but nothing works. Every other developer I work with hasnt had any issues like Ive encountered, and they also have both DX reporting and MS reporting working side by side without issue. p  pI found one other a hrefhttpanswers.flyppdevportal.comcategoriescsharpcsharpide.aspxID43f9ba11728b499a963b38878f36c178 relnofollowposta on a website that highlights the same problem I am encountering. The difference is that his resolution was basically to format his machine and reinstall everything. This is totally unacceptable. My OS is Windows 7 32bit, and I have VS2008, VS2010 and VS2012 installed, along with SQL 2008. p  pI am looking for any advice on a potential resolution for this problem. It is imperative that I get the reporting component up and running ASAPp

Negative 647 pIve been using PHP and MySQL for years now, but never in a formal setting. I use it to streamline things at my work, and have programmed a lot of my own commercial websites, but Im not employed as a programmer, and never have been. Im looking to start doing some freelance work though, and Im wondering about what some of the best practices are. p  pI always use a getter class to retrieve data from mysql, and setter class to enter data into mysql, to which I pass the connection class. Every mySQL table and field name has its own constant defined in a constants include file. What I usually do though, is enter the constant directly into the setter or getter classes, rather than passing them as a variable. It makes life easier and quicker to do it this way, but it does defy my understanding of a function within a class as being something that should be independent.p  pJust to be clear, this is an example of what I usually dop  pconstants.inc.phpp  precodedefineTABLENAME,tablename codepre  pdbasegetters.class.phpp  precodepublic function getdataconnection     query  SELECT  FROM  . TABLENAME     result  connection etc...  codepre  por should I be doing it like thisp  pdbasegetters.class.phpp  precodepublic function getdataconnection, tablename     query  SELECT  FROM  . tablename     result  connection etc...  codepre  pIt just seems like a lot more hassle to do it by passing the variable, especially because if I want to change the parameters of the function by adding a new field to search, I have to find every instance of the function calls and change them, whereas if I use constants, I just need to add them to the function.p  pAlso, when it comes to things like declaring constants, Ive always used singlequotes. But when I create strings, I always use doublequotes. Is this being inconsistent, and should I just use one type of quote all the timep  pThanksp

Negative 647 pIm using fineuploader to take multiple large files and pass the filename along with an additional userinput parameter. I do that by creating a text input box called allelefreq next to each file and I pass the filename and the allelefreq parameter to my cgi script.br What happens next or what will happen next is that I analyse the data in the file, using the allelefreq parameter and then some images are returned to the page for the user to look at.br If the user wants to reanalyse the data with a new allelefreq, all I want to do is to pass the filename along with the new allelefreq, i.e. I dont want to have to upload the file again. Ive pasted my working code below it uploads multiple files along with user input for each file and then the code that I cant get to work it produces a resubmit button, but doesnt appear to do anything, along with some commentsmusings within the code.br Any information on how I would do this will be gratefully received.

Negative 647 pI ran into a problem where a change in server configuration meant that all my attempts to download images with codeMvxImageViewLoadercode were getting redirected until it eventually gave up. After a lot of fretting, we finally discovered that the lack of a useragent header in the http request was the culprit. So, two questionsp  p1 Despite the failure to load, no errors where produced by the MvxImageViewLoader and setting an codeErrorImagePathcode didnt result in the error image being displayed instead. This seems wrong. I would have at least expected an error message in the debugger.p  p2 Is there a simple way to add a useragent header After looking at the source for the download cache plugin, I created my own version of codeMvxHttpFileDownloadercode which is exactly the same as the original except it creates my own version of codeMvxFileDownloadRequestcode which again, is exactly the same as the original, except I add the user agent header before starting the request. Then my version of codeMvxHttpFileDownloadercode is registered in codeAppDelegatecode replacing I assume the original. This seems a little heavy handed. Is there a simpler wayp

Negative 647 pI have a codeDialogFragmentcode that contains codeAutoCompleteTextViewcode, and codeCancelcode and codeOKcode buttons.p  pThe codeAutoCompleteTextViewcode is giving suggestions of usernames that Im getting from server.p  pWhat I want to do is to restrict the user to be able to enter only existing usernames.p  pI know I can do check if that username exists when the user clicks codeOKcode, but is there some other way, lets say not allow the user to enter character if there doesnt exist such username. I dont know how to do this because on each entered character Im getting only up to 5 suggestions. The server is implemented that way.p  pAny suggestions are welcomed. Thank youp

In that file though, I have the non member function read, that is called in one of the constructors of the struct Salesdata. So to circumvent that I forward declared struct and declared the read function before the struct definition in salesdat.h. p  pIve been trying different things like putting the definition of struct in its own file and putting the declaration only in the header file.

Negative 647 pFirstly I have to say this is not a duplicate of codedeep copying vs shallow copying clonecode in Java. but it is related to that. I have read other posts on codedeep vs shallow copyingcode in SO and while working on a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6182565javadeepcopyshallowcopyclonethisa, I found some problem with my understanding. Question is  codeclone and system.arraycopycode gives different arrays in the below example. but they arent supposed top  pI used array as a field in another example object below. There again I see they are different references for the arrays fields. The code is commented for easy following.p  precodeimport java.util.Arrays import java.util.   class Example          public int foo         public int[] bar          public Example int foo, int[] bar           this.foo  foo          this.bar  bar                   public void setfooint foo             this.foofoo                  public int[] getbar             return bar           public class ClonevsDeepCopy      public static void mainString[] args         Example 1         StringBuffer[] arr  new StringBufferabc,new StringBufferdef,                                      new StringBufferghi         StringBuffer[] arr2  arr.clone         StringBuffer[] arr3  new StringBuffer[3]         System.arraycopyarr, 0, arr3, 0, 2         check for identity         System.out.printlnarrarr2         System.out.printlnarrarr3         End of example 1          Example 2         this is equivalent of shallow copying which is clone           The normal interpretation is that a shallow copy of eg1            would be a new Example object whose foo equals 1            and whose bar field refers to the same array as in the original e.g.                   Example eg1  new Example1, new int[]1, 2         Example eg2  new Exampleeg1.foo,eg1.bar         System.out.printlneg1.bareg2.bar         eg1.setfoo4         eg1.bar[0]99          This is equivalent of deep coying         The normal interpretation of a deep copy of eg1 would          be a new Example object whose foo equals          1 and whose bar field refers to a copy of the original array e.g.                  Example eg3  new Exampleeg1.foo,Arrays.copyOfRangeeg1.bar, 0, 2         System.out.printlneg3.bareg1.bar         cloning on array         Example eg4  new Exampleeg1.foo,eg1.bar.clone         System.out.printlneg4.bareg1.bar         End of example 2            codepre

Negative 647 pWere looking to use Azure Active Directory as our user store for an externalfacing application.

However, we have a major problem in that users must login with not just their username but also the domain name. Its unreasonable and simply a dealbreaker to force a fictitious email address on our users as their username.p  pIs there some way to set this up such that the user need not type in a domain name In our case, we have only one Identifying Party behind ACS the one AAD directory.

Negative 647 pIve got an iOS app in which it starts differently if the user has been logged in through Facebook account or not.p  pSo the application flow is as followsp  p1 I call app delegate, which creates a navigationController and shows it.p  p2 In the root view controller, it checks if the user is logged in or not. By default for example during the first boot it loads view controllers as not logged in, showing only contents for not logged user. if the user is logged with Facebook account it sends requests to a server and shows the contents for logged in user. The requests start with didupdatelocation delegated method, from which it gets the current location.p  p3 there are many places in which the app asks if you want to log in. If the user gets correct login, it creates a new navigation controller, as in app delegate, and displays it. The problem is that in this way it doesnt call the method didupdatelocation, and so it doesnt get current location and doesnt make any request to server.p  pHow can you suggest me to solve the problemp

Precompiled assets are being served...but the thing is, those files dont physically exist in the development app directory. They only exist in the production app directory completely separate. This means that even though the URLs are pointing to dev.mydomain.comwhatever, everything is ACTUALLY running through mydomain.comwhatever...and the production application of my rails app is running.

Negative 647 pIve been dealing with WPF in the last time and Im trying to understand MVVM, but there is a bit of uncertainty The data is inside the Model and the View binds to the View Model, right But is there really just data inside the model or is it legit to have for example a save method or a method which picks up the data from a database inside the modelp  pThe next thing is Im binding to the View Model and obviously there is an instance of the Model inside the View Model. So I encapsulate the data from the Model instance again in the View Model, so I can bind to it although the data is already encapsulated inside the Model I saw several implementations which had the main data inside the View Model and encapsulated the fields which were inside the View Model and not inside the Model, so how to do it the right wayp  pAnd the third uncertainty is Whats the common way to validate the data Inside the Model with a IDataErrorInfo or inside the View Models encapsulating I found several implementation of the MVVMPattern on the internet and some of them were so different to the next, that Im unsure how to manage these things.p

Negative 647 pI recently modified my iOS app to enable serialized mode for both a database encrypted using SQLCipher and a nonencrypted database also SQLite. I also maintain a static sqlite3 connection for each database, and each is only opened once by simply checking for null values and shared throughout the lifetime of the app.p  pThe app is required to have a synclike behavior which will download a ton of records from a remote database at regular intervals using a soap request and update the contents of the local encrypted database. Of course, the person using the app may or may not be updating or reading from the database, depending on what theyre doing, so I made the changes mentioned in the above paragraph.p  pWhen doing short term testing, there doesnt appear to be any issue with how things work, and Ive yet experience any problem.p  pHowever, some users are reporting that theyve lost access to the encrypted database, and Im trying to figure out why.p  pMy thoughts are as follows Methods written by another developer declared all sqlite3stmts to be static I believe this code was in the problematic release. In the past Ive noticed crashes when two threads using a particular method run simultaneously. One thread finalizes, modifies or replaces a sqlite3stmt while another thread is using it. A crash doesnt always occur because he has wrapped most of his SQLite code in trycatch blocks. If its true that SQLite uses prepare and finalize to implement locking, could the orphaning of sqlite3stmts which occurs due to their static nature in this context be putting the database into an inoperable state For example, when a statement acquires an exclusive lock after being stepped is replaced by an assignment in the same method running in another threadp  pI realize that this doesnt necessarily mean that the database will become permanently unusable, but, consider this scenariop  pAt some point during the apps lifetime it will rekey the encrypted database and that key is stored in another database. Suppose that it successfully rekeys the encrypted database, but then the new key is not stored in the other database because of what I mentioned above. Provided that the database hasnt become corrupted at some point Im not really counting on this being the case, this is the only explanation I can come up with for why the user may not be able to use the encrypted database after restarting the iOS app, seeing as the app would be the only one to access the database file.p  pBeing that I cant recreate this issue, I can only speculate about what the reasoning might be. What thoughts do you have Does this seem like a plausible scenario for something that happens rarely Do you have another idea of something to look intop

Negative 647 pI wish to apply the technique of histogram equalization to a captured video using Python Image Library and OpenCV. But I looked online for resources or possible techniques regarding this topic but came up with nothing. Is it possible to perform frame by frame histogram equalization of a video and then reconstruct the frames back to obtain the equalized video Or if there is an alternative technique to do it then please suggest some links. I understand that it will be extremely resource intensive but that is not an issue. p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 647 pIm trying to share a large numpy array between processes using pool.imapunordered. Should be easy but Im trying to do it from within a emclassem. Right now Im just passing the data everytime and everything works well until the data gets sufficiently large and pool just hangs and doesnt launch the parallel processes. Since only a subset of the large data is needed for each parallel process, an alternative is to only pass a subset, but I dont know how to in my current framework.p  pSince functions used for multiprocessing must be in the global namespace, Im placing my function outside of the class as follows toy example of real problemp  precodeimport numpy as np import mutliprocessing.Pool import itertools  def processargs     largedata, index  args     return somecostlyoperationlargedata[index]  class MyClass     def initself          Lets pretend this is large         self.data  np.zeros10      def doself         p  Pool         for result in p.imapunorderedprocess,             itertools.izipitertools.repeatself.data, xrange10              print result codepre  pI know this is a hacky way to do multiprocessing and theoretically you shouldnt do it from within a class and should protect by checking if youre in main...

It works as expected when i run sed from Ccygwinbin or if I add that directory to environment variable.p  pBut my repository is in another drive. Also our project structure is so that we have a tools directory in our repository from which we have to use sed.exe, mysql.exe etc many other tools. So I had to copy sed.exe to tools directory along with its associated dll files and for testing purpose dumped dummy.xml to that folder also. p  pBut if I ran sed from that directory execution occurs but dummy.xml contains nothing. All data are gone p  pAny solution to this problem  p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 647 pQuestion in my book is asking What restrictions are placed on instance variable and static variable access from within the definition of 1. An instance method 2. A static methodp  pIs my response to this concept correctp  pAn instance method cannot directly access the instance variable while a static variable can be directly accessed since one copy is used throughout the class. Each object will share this static variable as well as the static methods in the class. An instance variable is only available to each object and each object has its own copy of this instance variable.  A static method cannot access instance members of the class. A static method can however access members of the static variable.p

Negative 647 pFor a singlepage app to be RESTful it needs access to API endpoints from which to retrieve its content. This means that youll have, say, a codeAPIuserinformationcode endpoint, and a codeAPIarticlecode endpoint, and an codeAPIcommentscode endpoint and so on. For large applications these ajax calls will slow down rendering, especially over slow mobile connections. Ironically, this is not as much of a problem in the oldworld of doing everything serverside, since the entire html is delivered in bulk upon the first request. Thus, siglepage apps, which are supposed to be faster and more responsive than oldschool serverrendered apps, may end up being considerably slower admittedly, only if they require a large enough number of API calls.p  pThe options, as far as I can see, seem to be 1 Forget singlepage apps, go back to doing everything serverside. 2 Consolidate all the API endpoints into fewer possibly one endpoints so all content is retrieved with minimum latency. But now youre not longer RESTful.p  pThese are both unsatisfying and sad. Is there a better solutionp  pPS caching content in local storage seems to cause more problems than it solves because now you have to worry about invalidating clientside caches every time you push out fresh content.p

I have one hstore column that ends up representing each hour a day, so it has 24 different keys. When I run the simulation for just this column I end up with almost no toast, in the KB, but when I run the whole simulation, with the days broken up into months columns, my largest hstore has 52 keys.p  pSo for a simple store of either a counter or a word or two, the max number of keys before I see any amount of toast for hstore is between 24 and 52 keys.p

Negative 647 pI have a codeFragmentActivitycode which creates a codeListFragmentcode. Inside the codeListFragmentcode is a custom adapter. When I would try to make the adapter public, it wouldnt let me. So, I dont really have access to the adapter or Im not sure how to get it.

However, other data I want to retrieve with codeAsyncTaskcode from a Database. I get this data in the parent activity and I know right when it is finished fetching the data. So, Can I update the codelistViewcode within the codeListFragmentcode with access to the codearraylistcode, but not access to the adapter If so, can I do it from the activity or do I need to somehow call a method in codelistFragmentcode If I need to call a method in codelistFragmentcode, how do I access that method from the activity If this is not possible without access to the adapter, how do I get access to the adapter without the public keyword Would it be better to move my codeAsycTaskcode to my codeListFragmencodetp  pI know it sounds like a lot, but Im just wondering how to refresh the codelistviewcode with those cicumstances.

Negative 647 pGemfireRepository is a gemfire specific implementation of CrudRepository but the spring data gemfire reference guide says if we use GemfireRepository then we need to  have our domain classes correctly mapped to configured regions as the bottstrap process will fail otherwise..does that mean that we need to have Region annotation on the domain classesIn case we use  CrudRepository then Region annotation is not required because CrudRepository is not dependent on Region p  pSo I am using GemfireRepository and I have a cacheloader configured as plug in to a region and the cacheloader depends on the GemfireRepository to fetch the data from RDBMS. So according to the reference documentation if GemfireRepository is internally dependent on Region..then does that create a circular dependency p

But in the second case, according to Microsofts Preinstalling Driver Packages, it should to copy the INF to cWindowsinfoem.inf which it does then once a device is present, it should install the driver based on the info in the INF, which it does not, and I have to go to the device manager, remove the unknown device, and scan for hardware changes to make it install.p  pIn the first case device present, our driver .sys file gets copied to the cwindowssystem32drivers dir, whereas in the second case it never does. If I just separately copy the .sys file to cwindowssystem32drivers, everything works. I can just do that but that seems kludgey and risky given that its all supposed to be handled automatically, based on my reading of Microsofts Preinstalling Driver Packages doc.p

Negative 647 pI am trying and failing to implement a loaded function for a dynamically loaded image. I have the html element in the html markup first. I then have a timer that starts to fire on the jquery document ready function.  Each time the timer fires ticks, i set the source on the html image element, and i want to know when it loads.  If it loaded correctly, i want to stop the timer.  if it didnt load correct, do nothing.  p  pMy main attempt focused on checking the natural width and height of the image node after i had set the source.  but since the code probably ran faster than the load of the image, checking the natural widht and height right after the source setting resulted in values of 0 and 0.p  pShould i just add a time delay between setting the image source and checking the natural widthheight Is that the correct solutionp  pHere is what i have.  Notice that the loaded event never fires, but every 2 seconds i get the messages HERE and HERE2p  precodeltheadgt ... ltscriptgt var timer  document.readyfunction       timer  setIntervalfunction   tick , 2000   function tick         alerthere     loginTestImage.onload, function               never gets here         alertloaded image         window.clearIntervaltimer          alerthere2      loginTestImage.attrsrc, httpsasdasd.sds.comasdpimagesasdasd.png  ltscriptgt ltheadgt ltbodygt     ltimg idloginTestImagegt ltbodygt codepre

I did look to use other methods but some of these sites block crawlers and the information is being pulled off specific sites into a workbook to be analysed so using VBA and DOM seems logical.p  pOn one of the lines I have declared the element and am sourcing the information required via a class name  with a div class as per belowp  precodeelem.Children1.getElementsByClassNamepricingSummarydiv.innerText codepre  pGenerally this sources what I need  looking at the element class name for pricingSummary on div tags.

Negative 647 pPardon my ignorance here, but Im attempting to put the a hrefhttpnvie.compostsasuccessfulgitbranchingmodel relnofollowgitflowa model into practice manually, without the gitflow toolset.p  pOne concept I found interesting was the idea that there would be a master branch for which every commit was a bonafide workable release.  So you have your v1.0.0 commit on master tagged, then your v1.1.0 tag, and thats a nice 2commitlong log when viewing master.  But then youre ready to release v1.2.0 and your codedevelopcode branch has 1000 intermediate commits, but youre ready to sign off and push the button to say emall right, its release timeem.p  pMy goal is to add a third commit onto the master timeline.  I can see that the codesquashcode option will let you add a single commit onto the master, so you view the master log and see your three commits v1.0.0, v1.1.0, and v1.2.0.  As lengthy and verbose as the develop branch may be, the squashing gets you down to a neat history for master where each version is an official release...no chance of grabbing an intermediate development commit off thatp  pIt works, but the thing that troubled me is that looking in the network graph this produces a disconnected commit.  Theres no apparent relationship that Git understands tying this squashed third commit to all those thousands of additions to the develop branch.  It seems to float alone, unlike the gitflow diagrams which are handdrawn and always point things to things.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comIVsnW.png altgit flow hand drawnp  pOther options for merging which get the merge arrow a.k.a. the multiple parents seem to have the side effect of establishing a connection to the intermediate commits.  So suddenly master isnt just these 3 blessed commits...it has expanded to include the full history of all these 1000 commits on develop.  Kind of seems to defeat the purpose, if the point of master was to be a branch containing only releasable versions...but suddenly every intermediate state has a commit on master.  1003 instead of 3 master commits.p  pGit visualization is a bit sinister in that it glosses over duplication in branches.  So the diagrams I see drawn on gitflow are pictures and not terminal printouts of codegit logcode etc.   I am unsure what one is to expect from a statement like saying that master only consists of releasable versions.p  pLong story short I cant find options that retain the arrowlooking relationship between develop and master at a release point unless they carry the full commit history.  Should this worry me if I look at gitflow diagrams which have lots of arrows  In the scenario I outlined, should I look at the master history and see every intermediate develop version that was merged and a 1003 commit history, or the 3 commit historyp

Negative 647 pIs there a way to make a stored procedure along with the other things its supposed to do create a text file on a local hard drive Ive heard it is possible, but when Ive searched for it on the inet Ive only found how to export result sets into text files.. but thats not what I need, I need something simple enough that helps me know the stored procedure is being executed when called from a C webapp. So it would be best to have an instruction inside the SP that creates a file on a specified route with some text like hello world or passed by here something like that. I was thinking that maybe if I could execute a windows command line from the SP, I could create the file...p  pI apologize if this was asked before, Im feeling pretty sure it didnt, from the search and research I did before asking.p  pThank you guys for your kind advicesp

Negative 647 pIm working in a microservice architecture, which has its own oauth2 provider in order to allow services interaction. p  pI need to develop a service that is granted to access users resources in order to perform internal tasks on user accounts. Since the service needing to access user resource is an internal one its not a viable solution to ask the user to allow access to their own resources.p  pIm concerned about the choice of picking the right grant to perform this tasks, as the codeclientcredentialscode seems the right one, it also seems to be used to only allow to only update service data, instead of accessing user resources. Another solution I thought is to automatically provide the authorization code at users signup, as if the user has clicked an allow button, and then perform requests with that codecodecode grant. The downside here is that I have to create new authorization codes each time a service with that needs is created, but it seems to be a more clear solution as auth code for user XXX only allows to access resources of user XXX.p  pI also understand that implementations are different as the standard gives a lot of flexibility, but  Which one, in your opinion, is the appropriate solution How would you handle it Would it be more clear to say, statistic service is allowed to access all users resources or statistic service is granted by all users to access their resourcesp

Negative 647 pI have a 40 million x 22 numpy array of integer data for a classification task. Most of the features are categorical data that use different integer values to represent different categories. For example, in the column Color 0 means blue, 1 means red and so on. I have preprocessed the data using LabelEncoder.  1 Does it make sense to fit those data into any classification model in SKlearn I tried to fit the data into Random Forest model but got extremely bad accuracy. I also tried One Hot Encoding to transform the data into dummy variables, but my computer can only deal with a sparse matrix after using One Hot Encoding, the problem is that Random Forest can only take a dense matrix, which will exceed my computers memory.  2 Whats the correct strategy to deal with categorical data in SKlearnp

Negative 647 pWere developing a Java application that reads a Config file at runtime. My question is that which of the following scenario is efficient for reading a Config file.p  blockquote   pScenario 1 Retrieves a value from config by opening the file, get the value, then close the file.p blockquote  pSo this means that file will be open and close every time retrieving a value.p  blockquote   pScenario 2 Open the file during initialization, then expose the object statically across the runtime.p blockquote  pFile will be open once, then retrieving a value using the Config object.p  pHonestly, we currently using the scenario 2. A reason why we choose it because Config file will be open once. Opening file needs syncrhonization, which may lead to untimely retrieval of value. Also, scenario 1 may cause runtime error if the Config file is moved from its absolute path anything is possible. But scenario 1 is efficient when it comes in modifying the Config values during runtime.p  pSo which is efficient p
Negative 647 pI have a text editor as part of my app. I have used EditText.SetCustomSelectioactionmodecallback to add a couple of extra options. If selected these options surround the selected text with a specific suffix and prefix. On a phone my new options appear on the overflow menu as cut, copy, paste and select all options take up the default spaces.  All was fine in Honeycomb but since I have upgraded to Kitkat if I choose an option from the overflow menu the text that was selected is deselected. This makes my options useless. Any ideas why raise is happening or what I can do to ensure that the text stays selected when the overflow options are usedp  pI found a work around herea hrefhttpscode.google.compandroidissuesdetailid82640 relnofollowhttpscode.google.compandroidissuesdetailid82640ap

Negative 647 pI apologize in advance for my ignorance if this is a stupid question.p  pI am running into an issue with an application that is, apparently, receiving messages asynchronously and losing responses sporadically. Essentially, I log when a client posts a message to the service and another when it responds. These log entries include a unique correlation id that I can use to crossreference the requests and responses. We ship the logs to logstash and I have been able to find a few that were caught by clients that have a received log entry and no reply. Im not at all sure how this could happen. p  pHowever, what I need to do first is determine the scope of this issue by comparing the correlation ids. Before moving to logstash we used splunk and I was able to use their join functionality to find such correlations. Is this functionality available via logstash Or is there an API call I can make to dump individual query results to and run my own logicp  pstrongPreviously omittedstrong This is a full ELK stackp  pTIAp

Negative 647 pAs the iOS documentation states, when an iOS application that utilizes BLE as a peripheral moves to background mode, the local name is not advertised and all service UUIDs are placed in the overflow area. The documentation states that they can only be discovered by an iOS device. p  pMy overall question is how exactly this happens on a lower level. Using a noniOS bluetooth packet sniffer, I examined the advertisement data structure from my iOS peripheral app when it was in foreground and in background modes. The advertisement data structure in foreground mode looks to be what was expected, similar to other advertisement data from noniOS devices, such as those I have coming from an Android device.p  pWhen the iOS app is background mode, this structure changes and the service UUID is not apparent. I do not see anything suggesting an overflow area.p  pHow does a iOS central device discover a peripheral device that is in background mode if the UUID is not a part of the advertising data packetp
Negative 647 pIm attempting to get the xlslib library a hrefhttpsourceforge.netprojectsxlslib relnofollowhttpsourceforge.netprojectsxlsliba to work in my Windows MFC program VC 2010.  The Excel file generated can be somewhat large and I need to be able to write multiple Excel files without closing the dialog, which has caused some problems.p  pThe root class is called workbook.  I initially declaredp  precodeworkbook xls codepre  pin the function that handles Excel export, but that blew up the stack.  xls got too large.p  pNext attempt I declared mxls in the class definition for my dialog, but I cant figure out how to clear mxls between calls and if you run the Excel export more than once when the dialog is open, the data from the first run ends up in the second, the third run gets data from the 1st and 2nd, etc.p  pI tried clearing the data from the first run at the end of the export function.  I looked at what was done in the deconstructor for the class to delete the data from the main data storage vector.  The workbook class is very complex with many subclasses and no matter when I try the program becomes very unstable after the first run through the Excel code after clearing the data and I get an assert in a thread pool function when I quit the program and a number of first chance exceptions in the output window.p  pLastly I declared a workbook pointer in the class and then dynamically allocated a workbook withp  precodempxls  new workbook codepre  pat the start of the function.  At the end I deallocate with deletep  precodedelete mpxls codepre  pThis blows up the program with the following error messagep  precodeHEAP[Program.exe] Heap block at 06329360 modified at 0632950A past requested size of 1a2 Windows has triggered a breakpoint in Program.exe.  This may be due to a corruption of the heap, which indicates a bug in Program.exe or any of the DLLs it has loaded.  This may also be due to the user pressing F12 while Program.exe has focus.  The output window may have more diagnostic information. codepre  pIt looks like all that was allocated was the basic class with no data in it and all data added by the functions in xlslib went way outside the bounds of the memory allocated.  Maybe Im misunderstanding something, but dont the deconstructors for workbook and all its subclasses get called when the memory is deallocatedp  pI need to figure out how to do one of two things herep  p1  Figure out how to reinitialize the statically declared mxls in the class definition on further calls to the Excel code.

Negative 647 pI have a requirement where I have around 50 tables in MySQL database which connects to the application for normal user operations.

Negative 647 pMy analysis is often a long pipeline separated into small Rmarkdown files that I then compile with knitr. I often would like to start a new Rmd file at the end of one or more Rmarkdown file specifically I would like to be able to have the results of the R environment. However, Id like to not get a mammoth file at the end, but keep the resulting .html file from each of them separate  they get unwieldy otherwise. I am not however, concerned that I have to manually running each of them separately, unlike the post a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions21688250knitrknittingseparaternwdocumentswithinanrmddocumentrq1knitr Knitting separate Rnw documents within an Rmd documenta p  pFor example Develop method A on data A.Rmd, then method B on data B.Rmd. Now compare the results of A and B CompareAB.Rmd. Usually A.Rmd and B.Rmd both have some long pieces I dont want to rerun, so I would also like to pull the cache of both of these, but if they havent been run or have been changed, Id want it to rerun it. Another example I want to make a presentation e.g. latex beamer using the results of A.Rmd and B.Rmd. The idea is not just that they share common code, but that they have separate code but the files depend on each other. I give a simple example below of a parent and child file below, where I use Sys.sleep10 in the child file to easily detect whether the parent file seems to be using the caching of the child file or recalculating it. p  pThe obvious way I see to do this is with including as a chunk option at some point, codechildcA.Rmd,B.Rmdcode. However, this has two problems. 1 It doesnt seem to pull the cache of the child files, and instead recalculates the files even if nothing has changed and 2 It puts all of the output text and plots of the child files in my file. p  pAnother option that would pull the cache would be to use lazyLoad on all of the cache of the child files A.Rmd and B.Rmd, but that wont be smart to whether its uptodate to changes in the original files. That would definitely be a temporary hack that could work, but not a real solution. And then another work around is to save the results that I need in later files to a file .txt or .Rdata. This is definitely a solution, but probably means I wind up rerunning the long parts of A.Rmd and B.Rmd files again anyway, because I didnt originally know Id want a specific object later so Id have to change the code so the cache would rerun. It also results in a lot of ugly code writing and reading and wouldnt know if the results were uptodate. So I thought Id check if there is a more elegant way to do this or perhaps this is starting to be a feature request instead. p  pThis seems somewhat like the question in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10966109howtosourcermarkdownfilelikesourcemyfilerHow to source R Markdown file like source39myfile.r39a but the questions from 3 years ago not clear if there was a child option then, and it also seems like they arent interested in pulling the cache down too. p  pHeres my example.

Ive been looking into GruntGulp and get how those are combining the entire app into one .js file, but for development Im guessing you dont want to have to rerun grunt or gulp every time you want to update the app. p

Negative 647 pA a hrefhttpwww.timeanddate.comtimeleapseconds.htmlleap second will occura on June 30, 2015.  Different Operating Systems seem to handle this situation differently.  In my particular case, we are running a Red Hat 6.4 system with custom Java JDK 1.7 software that is heavily timedependent.  According to some a hrefhttpsaccess.redhat.comarticles15145recent Red Hat released informationa I found, our systems NTP daemon will ensure the OS automatically handle the leap second by repeating 235959 twice.p  pMy question is if I have a long running JDK 1.7 process, how does it know that a leap second is occurring  What I mean is, how does Java ultimately know the a hrefhttpwww.iers.orgIERSENHomehomenode.htmlIERSa people have decided to insert a leap second  The a hrefhttpsdocs.oracle.comjavase7docsapijavautilDate.htmlDatea documentation seems to indicate is aware of leap seconds, but seems unhelpfully vague.  Can I assume the JDK, when the appropriate codeDatecode object is constructed or  codeCalendar.getInstancecode is invoked, it is a pass through to the underlying OSs datetime handling to get the appropriate real time value  Which, in my case, sounds like it would repeat second 235959, because thats how the OS will handle it.p

Negative 647 pIm new to android, but in the interest of practicing and learning more I wanted to try to make a practice application that essentially allows the user to only be logged on within the minute that they first logged in. So in other words if you log in at 1023, the user will be logged out as soon as the clock strikes 1024. To do this, I log in via my codeLoginActivitycode I share the current minute in a codeSharedPreferencescode object. In the interest of making use of the codeonResumecode method in my codeAppActivitycode, my application first opens the main activity,codeAppActivitycode, which then opens my codeLoginActivitycode in the codeonCreatecode method of my codeAppActivitycode class.  Hopefully without being too redundant in my explanation, the goal is to call codesessionCheckerAsyncTask.executecode in the codeonResumecode method of my codeAppActivitycode.p  pHeres my login button found in codeLoginActivitycodep  precodeloginbutton.setOnClickListenernew View.OnClickListener          Override         public void onClickView v               int result  getTime              SharedPreferences pref  getSharedPreferencesPREF, MODEPRIVATE             SharedPreferences.Editor editor  pref.edit             editor.putIntSESSION, result             editor.commit              finish               codepre  pwith helper method codegetTimecode seen herep  precodeprivate int getTime          Calendar time  Calendar.getInstance         return time.getCalendar.MINUTE      codepre  pAs you can see Im simply storing the current minute in a codeSharedPreferencescode object via my login button. Now from here, I wanted to create an codeAsyncTaskcode in my codeAppActivitycode class that checks every 500ms .5 seconds if my current minute in codeAppActivitycode matches the minute that was stored in my codeSharedPreferencescode object, if not I want to essentially log the user out and send them back to the codeLoginActivitycode.p  pMy issue is, Im a bit confused about the types that I should be implementing in my codeAsyncTaskcode for my codedoInBackgroundcode and codeonPostExecutecode methods. Also do I need the codeonCancelledcode method, and would implementing it perhaps be useful for configuration changes within codeAppActivitycode  As of now Im thinking that I should set it up something like thisp  precodeprivate class SessionCheckerTask extends AsyncTaskltInteger, Void, Booleangt              Override         protected Boolean doInBackgroundInteger... minuteinSharedPreferences              Create a thread that refreshes every 500ms that checks current time              return false if the current time doesnt match the time in shared preferences                   Override         protected void onPostExecuteBoolean aBoolean              super.onPostExecuteaBoolean                               If false was returned create a toast that says Activity session has expired                 then open the login activity again                             codepre  pBut then Im also thinking that it shouldnt be necessary for codedoInBackgroundcode to have a type at all. Instead codeonPostExecutecode should only be called if the minute passed in codedoInBackgroundcode doesnt match the current minute, but Im not sure how to implement this in the typical codeAsyncTaskcode format.p
