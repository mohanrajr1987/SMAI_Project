However both activities seem to share a namespace or something, because the newly launched one is not able to get the WebView UI up and running. So this seemed to be leading me nowhere.p  pWhat I have now done is implement a check for intent before I start my app properly. If it was started with an intent I just store the data of the .custom file in my App.Properties and then try to close the currently running instance of the app via codeTi.Android.currentActivity.finishcode. However the Activity or something else seems to still be running, because when I open the app back up even if it was running while I did the other things, once I select it in the task manager it starts up from the beginning only bad things happen Every call from the WebView to the app and vice versa gets made more than once depending on how often the App has been started after the first opening of the .custom file. This obviously makes the app unusable because nothing works.p  pEven killing the app in the task manager does not always reset everything so that a call only gets made once.p  pCan anyone guess whats up herep  pOr even better give me guidelines on how to implement the use case properly While I do not fully understand the whole activity complex and how it interacts with appcelerator Id reckon that this may not happen if I wouldnt call my main launcher activity with the intent but another custom activity thats only responsible for importing the data from the .custom file and nothing else. But how does one create a custom activity with titaniump  pThanks for any help or nudge in the right directionp

Positive 20573 pWe have developed a global app for both iOS and Android using Appcelerator Titanium. It has few features which mandates using current location to accomplish the task. To do this, we have used Ti.Geolocation to fetch current location.In Android,The app works fine in all parts of the world but not in china.In iOS devices, app works in all parts of the world including china.To further investigate the issue on android, We created a sample app to fetch current locationi.e. latitude and longitude of the user, using Ti.Geolocation.Android both Manual Mode and Simple Mode inline to appcelerator docs. Tested the app in India and USA, it works fine. But , in china it always gives an error unable to fetch location or it doesnt work at all.p  pKindly, Provide an alternative if somebody has faced similiar issues.Thanks in advance.p
Positive 20573 pI am using Titanium SDK 4.1.0.GA and originally used version 1.2 of the Ti.Paint module for iOS. This version does not work properly on iOS 8 in the sense that the line drawn stutters.p  pI then upgraded the Ti.Paint module to 1.4 currently the latest release. The line drawing on the canvas now works perfectly, but for some reason there are no event Listeners for the Ti.Paint Object, where there were in previous versions of the module.p  pHow does one now check if someone is actually drawing on the canvas A good example of this is if you want use to Ti.Paint to have users provide their signature and you want to validate that interaction on the Canvas occurred.p

Positive 20573 pIn Titanium Studio, Im developing an Android app. I have a TableView that has rows that overflow beyond the pages height. One column of the table has a label that I want to rotate 270 degrees so that the text in it is vertical.p  pI am rotating the text like thisp  precodetr  Ti.UI.create2DMatrix tr  tr.rotate270  var label  Titanium.UI.createLabel     ...     ...     transform tr  codepre  pHowever, this transform seems to only apply to labels that are in sight. When I scroll down the table, the labels in the table that were previously beyond the pages height are still horizontal. When I scroll back to the top of the table, the labels that emhadem successfully rotated initially are back to being horizontal.p  pI tried using scroll, scrollend, dragstart, and dragend events to retransform labels once they have been scrolled to, but this method does not consistently work. When it does work, it is ugly because the labels, when scrolled to, are initially horizontal, and the user can see the animation of them being transformed a few seconds later.p  pHow can I avoid this and keep all of the labels rotated vertically from the start Is there a better method of rotating labelsp  pstrongAdditional thoughtsstrong The thing I find the oddest is that the labelstext have been created else they would not appear when I scroll down the table. They are the proper color and size. If the color and size properties are being properly applied, then why would transform not be I even tried changingp  precodetransform tr codepre  ptop  precodetransform Ti.UI.create2DMatrixrotate270 codepre  pwhich I imagine is the same thing asp  precodetransform Ti.UI.create2DMatrix.rotate270 codepre  pwhich also did not work.p

However it freezes at the splash screen if users try to do an update.p  pI am guessing this might be some cache related issue since the newer version is indeed totally different and also smaller in size. Could this really be the case or might it be due to something else p  pWe would really like to avoid publishing a new build to itunes but having current users not being able to update the app is also not very efficient. p

Negative 20573 pMy coworkers and I were having a discussion about this yesterday. It seems that no matter how well we prepare and no matter how much we test and no matter what the client says immediately before the site becomes public, initial site launches almost always seem to be somewhat rocky. Some clients are better than others, but often things that were just fine during testing suddenly go horribly wrong when the site becomes public. p  pIs this a common experience Im not just talking about functionality breaking down although thats often a problem as well. Im also talking about sites that work exactly the way we wanted them to, but suddenly are not satisfactory to the client when its time to make the site public. And Im talking about clients that have been familiar with the site during most of the development process. Meaning, the public launch is definitely not the first time theyve seen the site.p  pIf youve dealt with this problem before, have you found a way to improve the situation Or is this just something that will always be somewhat of a problemp

Negative 20573 pJust so you know ,Im learning to develop for iPhone without Interface Builder I have an app with a root view controller, a blue view controller and yellow view controller. The root VC lazyloads the blue and yellow VCs and displays the blue VCs view first, and then switches to the other one when a button in the toolbar at the bottom is pressed. I have all the autoresizingMasks set, so they rotate fine, but if say the blue view is being displayed, I rotate to landscape, its fine, but then when I switch views the yellow one is all messed up because its never autorotated, it starts out with portrait dimensions, and autorotates to landscape fine, but when it loads the normal portrait yellow view into the landscape view, everything is messed up, the yellow view never got autorotated with the rest because it wasnt even in view as a subview. So how can I fix this Is there some way I can make it initialize as if it had already autorotated if it does need to bep  pThanksp

Negative 20573 pI know there have been some similar questions to this, but they havent helped me.p  pIm trying to install Wordpress 2.8.4 on my XP box, with strongIIS 5.1strong. I installed MySQL, and found that it was possible to install Wordpress through the Microsoft Web Platform Installer. After installing Wordpress the install worked fine, I proceeded to the next step in the Wordpress installation documentation, which is to open wpadmininstall.php in your browser. IIS seemed to not be interpreting PHP, and when searching for the best way to install it, I saw that it is also available with Microsoft Web Platform Installer, so I installed it that way. However, my IIS isnt interpreting PHP still. I do not know what the problem is, but Im going to reboot right now and see if that helps, as I didnt reboot after the install even though it didnt say I have to. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanksp

Negative 20573 pThe a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiPersonal5FSoftware5FProcess relnofollowPersonal Software Processa PSP is designed to allow software engineers to understand and improve their performance. The PSP uses scripts to guide a practitioner through the process. Each script defines the purpose, the entry criteria, the steps to perform, and the exit criteria. PSP0 is designed to be a framework that allows for starting a personal process.p  pOne of the scripts used in PSP0 is the Development Script, which is to guide development. This script is used once there is a requirements statement, a project plan summary, time and defect recording logs are made, and a defect type standard is established. The activities of this script are design, code, compile, and test. The script is exited when you have a thoroughly tested application and complete time and defect logs.p  pIn the Code phase, you review the requirements and make a design, record requirements defects in the log, and perform time tracking. In the Compile phase, you compile, fix any compile time errors, and repeat until the program compiles, and record any defects and time. Finally, in the Test phase, you test until all tests run without error and all defects are fixed, while recording time and defects.p  pMy concerns are with how to manage the code, compile, and test phases when using modern programming languages especially interpreted languages like Python, Perl, and Ruby and IDEs.p  pMy questionsp  ul liIn interpreted languages, there is no compile time. However, there might be problems in execution. Is executing the script, outside of the unit and other tests, considered compile or test time Should errors with execution be considered compile or test errors when tracking defectsli liIf a test case encounters a syntax error, is that considered a code defect, a compile defect, or a test defect The test actually found the error, but it is a code problem.li liIf an IDE identifies an error that would prevent compilation before actually compiling, should that be identified If so, should it be identified and tracked as a compile error or a code errorli ul  pIt seems like the PSP, at least the PSP0 baseline process, is designed to be used with a compiled language and small applications written using a text editor and not an IDE. In addition to my questions, I would appreciate the advice and commentary of anyone who is using or has used the PSP.p

Negative 20573 pIm revisiting an ID scanner station program we built ages ago and I have a request from users to make a system beep. Were considering moving the system to a web browser, but is it possible to invoke a speaker beep via javascript or something It doesnt need to be crossbrowser compatible, but it probably needs to work on Windows or Linux. The stations in question are not equipped with a soundcard or external speakers, hence the request for a PC speaker access.p  pI know someones going to say it, so Ill address this up front I dont care what you think about applications making noise, strongthis isnt for youstrong. Users request it, it makes sense, and the hardware scanner already makes noise anyways. Yes, we give visual feedback, with distinguishable text and color, but we find that people accept the existing beep as positive feedback and adding more audio context would help.p

I noticed that there was a CTabCtrl class thats used in MFC to add tabs. However, once I added the tab ctrl using the UI designer, I couldnt specify how many tabs therell be using property window. Searching on the net, I found some examples but all of them required you to emderiveem from CtabCtrl , create 2 or more emchildem dialogs etc and to write your own custom class. My question is, since I want to do something so basic, why couldnt I do it using the familiar Add Event handlerAdd member variable wizard and then handle everything else inside my apps class  Surely, the default CTabCtrl class emcanem do something useful without needing to derive from it p

Negative 20573 pI just started working on upgrading a small component in a distributed java application.

Negative 20573 pSo I have some legacy code which I would love to use more modern techniques. But I fear that given the way that things are designed, it is a nonoption. The core issue is that often a node is in more than one list at a time. Something like thisp  precodestruct T      T next1     T prev1     T next2     T prev2     int value  codepre  pthis allows the core have a single object of type codeTcode be allocated and inserted into 2 doubly linked lists, nice and efficient.p  pObviously I could just have 2 codestdlistltTgtcodes and just insert the object into both...but there is one thing which would be way less efficient...removal.p  pOften the code needs to destroy an object of type codeTcode and this includes removing the element from all lists. This is nice because given a codeTcode the code can remove that object from all lists it exists in. With something like a codestdlistcode I would need to search for the object to get an iterator, then remove that I cant just pass around an iterator because it is in several lists.p  pIs there a nice cish solution to this, or is the manually rolled way the best way I have a feeling the manually rolled way is the answer, but I figured Id ask.p

Negative 20573 pWhen throwing exceptions, I often pass in a formatted string that exposes details about the problem that has occurred. I always specify a formatting provider if possible which is good practice because otherwise you may forget to decide which culture is appropriate and as the default is the current culture, that can lead to many bugs.p  pHeres an examplep  precodethrow new InvalidOperationException     string.Format         CultureInfo.CurrentCulture,         0 is a bad number.,         number codepre  pIm tempted to use codeCurrentCulturecode, as shown above, because exception messages are targeted at human beings ofcourse, code should never act on the exception message itself. The message will be formatted using the clients culture so whenever I need to display it to my client, it looks nice.p  pHowever, besides displaying messages to users, exceptions may be logged to a log file as well. Ive seen many messages sit in my log files, with all kinds of cultures used for formatting them. Pretty ugly In this case, codeInvariantCulturecode would be more appropriate or perhaps the culture of the server that is hosting the log file.p  pThe point here is that when formatting an exception, you just never know your audience so it seems impossible to decide which culture to use when formatting. It would be great to be able to postpone the formatting to the point at which the exception is caught but that would go way beyond the way exceptions are implemented in .NET.p  pSo what are your thoughts on thisp

Negative 20573 pGotten a lot of great help here The code here has been helped along by a few folks. Hopefully someone can help me take it to the next level.p  pBasically, I have code which will add a checkmark after a given period of time to a clicked item in the left navigation.  There are going to be other links on the page which are going to trigger the same behavior for the corresponding left links. So for example there would be 10 links on the left, and  10 links on top that would each need to trigger a corresponding link on the left.  I am trying to abstract this code so that I can activate it from a different source. To make it easier, it can be thought of as how to trigger this piece of code from a source outside of the navigation. Heres the codep  precodefunction   var thetimeoutnull  leftnav li a.clickfunction        leftnav li.notthis.cssbackgroundposition,left bottom       this.parent.cssbackgroundposition,left top       ifthetimeoutnull            window.clearTimeoutthetimeout                thetimeoutwindow.setTimeout.proxyfunction                   this.parent.cssbackgroundimage,urlimagescheck.png             , this       ,5000   codepre  pp  pI have a working demo with the top links not working up a hrefhttpwww.jontakiff.comchecks relnofollowhere.ap  pThanks for your time, I really appreciate it.p

Negative 20573 pIm trying to follow a hrefhttpsupport.microsoft.comkb210290 relnofollowMicrosofts examplea on how to add an All option to a ComboBox in Microsoft Access, but their article does not do an adequate job of providing guidance, aside from specifying the code.p  pWhat Im trying to do is build a form that allows a user to select an option from a ComboBox the options are generated from records in a table, and then build a report filtered based on the users selected option. The ComboBox consists of 2 columns the primary keyID of the records and their displayable names. p  pI cant understand the VBA code Microsoft provides enough to figure out what is going on, but I would like the All option in my ComboBox to either have a blank primary keyID, or one that  0. That isnt the case, as selecting the All option when using the form results in the error message The value you entered isnt valid for this field. This leads me to believe that the All text is getting filled into the primary keyID column instead of the display column. The example instructs me to assign the display column number as the Tag property of the ComboBox  and in this case, my display column number is 2. However, this and pretty much any other value I add results in the aforementioned error message. p  pAny idea if Microsofts example is even applicable to my case, or do I need to adjust their code somehowp

Negative 20573 pIm using drawTextOnPath to display some text on a Canvas and I need to know the dimensions of the text being drawn.

Any ideas Its possible Im doing everything right and the problem is with drawTextOnPath the text quality very visibly degrades when drawing along paths, even if the path is horizontal, likely because of the interpolation algorithm or whatever its using behind the scenes.  I wouldnt be surprised to find out that the size jitter is also coming from there.p

Dates are in the following format from the data provider 20110223 which would be written Februrary 23, 2011. I have been reviewing the post and comments talking about the iPhone reference date of 2001, and adjusting datetime values based on a delta of seconds since that time prior to inserting into sqlite. My importer script defines a TIMESTAMP column to store this delta of seconds. An example of the column after being stored would be 319766400.p  pHere is a snippet of Ruby as an example of what my script doesp  precodegtgt deltaseconds  Time.parse20110223  Time.local2001, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0 gt 320112000.0 gtgt Time.atdeltaseconds gt Fri Feb 22 190000 0500 1980 codepre  pNote that asking for a time from the deltaseconds Time.atdeltaseconds shows the right day of the year Feb 22 but in the year 1980, which is 10 years after EPOCHwhich seems right. In Core Data Ive defined my model attribute that maps to this DB field as NSDate. However, when I fire up the simulator and check the debugger, for each object I ask for the the NSDate field startdate as follows  [object valueForKeystartdate] which gives me 20010821 181019 GMT.  In other words, it doesnt seem to be reading the delta seconds value. If it did, Id expect it to apply 10 years worth of seconds in this case and come up with a 2011 year date.p  pCan you spot something Im doing wrong Any suggestions on potential fixes Thanks iOS 4.1 Core Datap  pstrongOrstrong can someone post a value from their sqlite database that Core Data reads, from a column that is intended to be the source of a NSDate field An example value from my database is code320371200code which appears to not work.p
Negative 20573 pThe natural answer would be to dereference the iterator and get the value.

If I did, I would arrange for the logging context obect to be copied and passed into the child thread.p  pMy logging context object cannot be static, because it would be overwritten by concurrent ASP.NET request threads and that would be bad.p  pThe members of my logging context object simple intstring properties could be marked ThreadStatic, which would work, and I would not need to use HttpContext.Current.Items anymore.p  pWhat I really need is a to make the .NET runtime copy the object or even pass a reference either would do and makes it available to child threads automatically.p  pI was wondering whether I could add a ltsystem.threadinggt element to web.config and nominate a helper class for creating threads like you can do for Web Requests in ltsystem.netgtp  pI also wondered whether I could mark my Logging Context object with some attribute that causes it to be copied automatically.p  pI looked into log4nets LogicalThreadContext, tried it, but it didnt work. I think thats for passing logging context information across processes or appdomain boundaries.p  pWhat mechanism does log4nets LogicalThreadContext used behind the scenes Something from System.Runtime.Remoting Is that deprecated nowp  pMy environment is .NET 4, so maybe with the parallel extensions or enhancements to threading in .NET 4 this is now possible.p  pAnyone any idea if this is at all possible Im beginning to think not.p  ul liUpdate li ul  pI have had to do the followingp  precodeTaskltIEnumerableltAccountgtgt accountsTask  TaskltIEnumerableltAccountgtgt.Factory.StartNew              instrumentationContext gt                              var parentContext  instrumentationContext as Site.Instrumentation.InstrumentationContext                 if Site.Instrumentation.InstrumentationContext.Current  null ampamp parentContext  null                     Site.Instrumentation.InstrumentationContext.Current  parentContext                 return GetAccounts             ,         Site.Instrumentation.InstrumentationContext.Current      codepre  pWhere the GetAccounts method calls on another class which in turn depends on Site.Instrumentation.InstrumentationContext.Currentp  pThe problem is, I would rather NOT have to change the code to explicitly pass in and set this state object in the child thread  I want the .NET Framework to do that for me automatically, so that the code above that creates the task is none the wiser and does not have to be changed.p  pIf noone else contributes with alternatives, Jon gets the green tick as I figured that was my only realistic choice albeit with tasks not threads.p

Negative 20573 pRecently I wrote a little chunk of code that grabs a CA certificate from a SCEP server, turns it into a SecCertificateRef and adds it to a keychain either System or login. Now Im wondering how I can get the system to trust that certificate. Ive been playing around with Trust Policies but I havent had much luck yet.p  pOn top of this, I understand that the system may not allow you to automatically trust a certificate without user interaction. If thats the case, how do you kick off the interaction Using SecCertificateAddToKeychain puts the certificate into the keychain silently.p  pSide note Im trying to support 10.5 with this code as well.p  pThanks for any helpp  pEdit After playing around with the code on the Citrix page I came up with my own function. From what I gathered from the Citix page, this method is destructive. So if the certificate is already in the keychain and already has policies iChat, etc this will overwrite those.

Negative 20573 pIm doing a spot of research surrounding Entity Framework and its associated .edmx files.p  pOur current setup has a number of these files compiled in to a library that we use extensively. Of course, this isnt exaclty an elegant solution  every time we want to update or add to something in the database layer, we need to recompile this library. p  pWe use stored procedures exclusively, and our current approach is to use the codeExecuteFunctioncode method on the object context. However, this does require knowledge of what imported functions from an edmx file return what type codecontext.ExecutionFunctionltTgtcode returns codeObjectResultltTgtcode.p  pMy theoretical solution is to store any .edmx files we want to use at a relative path, and have the library load them all at run time. p  pHas anybody tried this before Does it work Are there any performance considerations to take in to account This would be used in an ecommerce environment, so efficiency and speed is important.p  pstrongEDIT FOR SOME MORE CLARITYstrongp  pIt would certainly be possible to compile each individual .edmx file in to its own assembly, which might allow the use of a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarybb495513.aspx relnofollowthisa. Any input on that, too, would be great.p  pThe call we make now is something like thisp  precodeDatabase.MakeCallltTgtstoredprocedurename, parametersCollection, KnownDatabases.Database codepre  pIn its constructor, the database handler will hold instances of each of the database contexts it knows about each of the.edmx files in the library . Using the codeKnownDatabasescode enum, it chooses which database to run the query against.p  pIdeally, Id like to achieve a call like thisp  precodeDatabase.MakeCallltTgtcontextname, storedprocedurename, parametersCollection codepre  pWhere in the database handler will, in its constructor, search a folder for .edmx files and load them all, then store instances of each context against the context name. How codeTcode would be defined or obtained is a little blurry right now.p  pIn both cases, the return type would be codeObjectResultltTgtcodep

Since the java 1.5 implementation of the NTLM authentication protocol is not open source, I cannot compare the two implementations to understand what could be going wrong.p  pstrongUpdate 1strong p  pI am aware of the fact that commons http client does not support NTLM v2.

Do you know of any serverclient setting which indicates that the authentication would fail if the NTLM response data is empty since the authentication failure we are facing is reproducible only on one machine.

Negative 20573 pWhat I have is a drawing of a UI layout, that I want to be able to scale up and down to fill an android screen. I know this doesnt really fit with the android UI way Ive been reading about, but this is a very simple app for connection to an appliance  it has a couple of basic setting buttons, and a couple of realtime information display views.p  pIn this case, the UI elements all need dimensions that are known relative to the total width and height.p  pIve had a play with doing a layout using a combination of linear and relative layout tags in XML, and given a fixed emulator screen setting, I can make an arrangement of interface elements with explicitly set sizes that fill it up the way I want... Of course this doesnt work when I try it on different screen sizes. p  pSo my next step is going to be to add code to calculate the size of each element just before the activity is first created  then override the xml values I use to do the original layout. I dont mind doing this, but am a bit worried that it means the UI design will be defined in multiple places, and this isnt really ideal.p  pAs Im trying this, Id really love to hear from more experienced developers if theres going to be a problem i havent considered, and Id be better off stopping any attempt to work with standard UI system Views and layouts, and jump straight to the 2D graphics library, or if there is a nicer way of setting relative sizes for objects in an XML layout related to device screen size that Ive missed, despite my searchingp  pthanksp
Negative 20573 pI love how the main menu of this site drops down  fades in. There are a lot of dropdown plugins, etc out there but this particular implementation feels really smooth to me.p  pThe problem is its powered by Mootools and MenuMatic httpgreengeckodesign.commenumatic , but Im almost certain you can achieve the same effects with pure CSS.p  pI think the fading would be easy enough to accomplish with a CSS opacity transition, but im not sure how to 1 allow dropdowns to by dynamic in width and 2 scroll into view without breaking the markup around it. In past projects, Ive gotten around this with a left 9999em and the animation from 9999em to target location happens so quickly, no one knows any different... but that seems like a hack.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 20573 pA friend of mine and I have been using Google Docs for a while but it seems to be in the process of not supporting her browser anymore so as a fun project I thought I would try to imitate its functionality myself.p  pSo far Ive built a working facsimile in Codeigniter PHP that works fine on my machine locally however, Im trying to figure out if it is the most effective approachsafest to unleash on other people. Bear in mind that this is not meant to be a public service just for use by mostly 2 people, maybe 34 at most.p  pEach page of the app has a chat room and a view for whatever the current document is these are refreshed independently. The chat room basically pulls from a .txt file which is updated every time the user submits a message the chat refereshes via a JQuery AJAX call twice per second. So far Im not bothering with trying to note when a user left the chat, though I assume that would take a separate poll.p  pThe document view also updates via AJAX, but calling a controller function to ping a document MySQL database instead this call happens once per second as well as any time a user updates the document.p  pClearly this is going to have to be on a hosting plan that can accomodate traffic from the regular Javascript calls, but that aside, is this an acceptable way to approach the problem Will it cause undue strain on the client side or on the server Is there a better way Im very very selftaught, and while Im able to make something that works, I would love to have some confirmation that Im not taking the wrong approach.p  pThanks Hopefully this question makes sense glad to elaborate if necessary.p

Negative 20573 pI recently migrated my game to ARC. First, I noticed my app crashed after playing for a while. So I began debugging it and noticed that, on receiving a memory warning, the deallocation of some resources was being corrupted.p  pstrongBackgroundstrong Dont read if you understand the code belowp  pIn my game, OpenGL textures are encapsulated in an ObjectiveC class codeTexturecode. This class keeps track of the use count, i.e. how many objects are referencing the texture at a given time similar to ObjC coderetainCountcode with a property adeptly named codeuseCountcode. On deallocation, the OpenGL texture is destroyed.p  pSprites are created using codeTextureAtlascode objects. Each texture atlas is associated with a codeTexturecode object and a database of named subregions inside the texture image. On creation of the atlas, it increases the associated codeTexturecodes use count by 1. Also, each texture atlas keeps track of how many codeSpritecode instances are referencing its texture i.e., how many sprites have been created from the atlas and are still around.  Needless to say, on deallocation each atlas decreases the associated textures use count by 1.p  pIn addition, when a new codeSpritecode is created from a codeTextureAtlascode or otherwise, the codeuseCountcode of the corresponding texture is also increased, once by each sprite. And decreased again, on sprite deallocation.p  pSo, as long as some codeSpritecode is referencing a codeTextureAtlascodes texture, the atlas cant be purged. And as long as some codeSpritecode or codeTextureAtlascode is referencing a codeTexturecode, the texture cant be purged either.p  pcodeTexturecode objects and codeTextureAtlascode objects, in turn, are managed by the singletons codeTextureManagercode and codeTextureAtlasManagercode respectively. These two managers are responsible for creating resources as necessary and purging unused resources on lowmemory situations.p  pI chose this design decoupling codeTexturecode use count by sprites and atlases, and codeTextureAtlascode use count by sprites because some times I might need a texture for something else than a sprite say, a 3D object.p  pstrongStill herestrongp  pSo, when I receive a memory warning, first I call the codepurgecode method in the codeTextureAtlasManangercode p  precode void purge       Called on Low Memory Situations.      purges unused atlases.       atlasRank is an array of atlases in MRU order      atlasDatabase is a dictionary of atlases keyed by their name      NSUInteger count  [atlasRank count]          NSMutableArray atlasesToRemove  [[NSMutableArray alloc] init]      for NSUInteger i0 i lt count i           TextureAtlas atlas  [atlasRank objectAtIndexi]          if [atlas canDelete]               Means there are no sprites alive that where created               from this atlas              [atlasesToRemove addObjectatlas]              [atlasDatabase removeObjectForKey[atlas name]]              NSLogTextureAtlasManager Successfully purged atlas [], [atlas name]                  else              Means some sprite remains that was               created from this atlas              NSLogTextureAtlasManager Failed to purge atlas [], [atlas name]                    [atlasRank removeObjectsInArrayatlasesToRemove]       At this point, atlasesToRemove should be deallocated       by ARC, and every atlas in atlasesToRemove        should be deallocated as well.        This FAILS to delete unused textures     [[TextureManager sharedManager] purgeUnusedTextures]       Removed atlases are not yet deallocated and retain       their texture        ...But This SUCCEEDS     [[TextureManager sharedManager] performSelectorselectorpurgeUnusedTextures                                             withObjectnil                                             afterDelay0.5]       i.e., [TextureAtlas dealloc] gets called before purgeUnusedTextures  codepre  pIt seems that the temporary array I created to hold the atlases scheduled for deletion I dont like removing objects from the array being iterated is being autoreleased later.p  pIve checked this similar question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9173120inconsistentobjectdeallocationwitharcInconsistent object deallocation with ARCa , but I fail to see how it applies to my case. The array in question is a local variable of the method, created with allocinit.

Negative 20573 pI recently started a new project using different carefullychosen technologies, my project is built as follow p  pThe approach is APICentric, which means Im building a website and an iOS app communicating with an API written using codeSymfony2code. Ive successfully managed to write my API, and it is perfectly working.  To gain access to the services provided by the API, the main actors the emwebsite usersem, the emiOS app usersem and the emdevelopersem can authenticate theirself in several ways p  ul lipClients can gain access with a loginpassword couple through the website interface which is communicating directly with the API through AJAX to validate the provided credentials and set a session. So, when someones logs in our website, they have automatically access to the API as well.pli lipDevelopers can authenticate theirself through the API using codeHTTPBasiccode over codeSSLcode, which will as well generate a session and give them access to the services they are authorized to call.pli lipAlso, Developers and clients can gain access to the website and the API using their facebook account through the emFacebook Connectem functionality. This deletes the step where each actor has to create an account on our website.pli ul  pSo basically, the credentials are provided either through codeHTTPBasiccode or using the codeFacebook Logincode functionality.p  pNow that my authentication system is working and that my clients are able to access the website, I would like them to connect to a realtime server when they log in. Like in Facebook or Google if you want where the realtime server manages chat and push informations.p  pIn this case im using codeNode.jscode and the powerfull codesocket.iocode library to manage everything that deals with the realtime side.  Of course, the realtime service will need some credentials to authenticate the user since he is authenticated to the Symfony security system with a session but is not authenticated against the realtime server. p  pA solution Ive been thinking about would be to use the codePdoSessionStoragecode in my API Symfony side and store all the active sessions in a database such as MySQL or PostgreSQL. Doing so, I would be able to send to my realtime server the session id generated by symfony and check on the database if the session id provided is correct or not. If he is Ill let the user access the services provided by my realtime server and associate his session with an identity.  But I really dont know if this is a good solution and I would like some more experienced advices on this and on how to deal with this issue.p  pemNote  For some reasons, I cannot implement codeOAuthcode even if it could be a solution to solve this issue using a Single Sign On approach.emp
Negative 20573 pI am asking if it is possible to host a Microsoft Access form inside a .Net form.p  pNo I havent gone mad, we are maintaining a massive system written entirely in VBA by somebody who didnt know a lot of VBA attempting to use Microsoft Access as an IDE. Its basically thousands of lines of spaghetti code and while we would love to scrap it and start from scratch, this is not an option.p  pWe are therefore trying to improve what is there, and in this particular scenario it would be really helpful if we could somehow host the Microsoft Access forms inside a .Net Windows Form as we can interact with the proprietary hardware from .Net much more effectively than we can from VB6.p  pWe currently have a .Net application that runs on the computer alongside the many MSAccess databases that the users have open at any one time, and the .Net application interacts with these using MS Access Interop with varying degrees of success. This is because it uses form titles and filenameslocations to get a handle on the database to do what it needs to do, and also relies on the user not interferingswitching off the applicationmoving the databases to their desktops etc. Its a bit of a mess.p  pTherefore, I am asking if it is possible to somehow host a Microsoft Access form inside a .Net Windows form, by maybe adding the form itself as a control or a subform, in a way that would give me direct access to all of the controls on the form from .Netp

Negative 20573 pIm looking for an algorithm to randomize a set of items with length codencode, where there might be multiples 1 to codemcode of each item. An additional constraint is that the same item may not appear within codekcode items of the previous one.p  pYou may assume codencode is well under 100, and there always is a solution, i.e. codemcode as well as codekcode are small.

Some goals may appear multiple times e.g. kill the boss, but should not be close to each other, so simply shuffling the bag is no good.p  pI could shuffle the list, then iterate over it while keeping track of item intervals, starting with a new shuffle if it fails the test, but Im looking for a more elegant solution that should also be compact, practical and easily implemented with e.g. C, C or JavaScript. In other words it should not rely on special language features or standard library functions that I might not understand or could find hard time implementing. However, you may assume the most common list operations such as sorting and shuffling are available.p

Negative 20573 pI am designing a class in C that extracts URLs from an HTML page. I am using Boosts Regex library to do the heavy lifting for me. I started designing a class and realized that I didnt want to tie down how the URLs are stored. One option would be to accept a codestdvectorltUrlgtcode by reference and just call pushback on it. Id like to avoid forcing consumers of my class to use codestdvectorcode. So, I created a member template that took a destination iterator. It looks like thisp  precodetemplate lttypename TForwardIterator, typename TOutputIteratorgt TOutputIterator UrlExtractorgeturls     TForwardIterator begin,     TForwardIterator end,      TOutputIterator dest codepre  pI feel like I am overcomplicating things.

At this point, someone reading the code doesnt realize that codeTForwardIteratorcode is iterating over a codestdstringcode.p  pIn my particular situation, I am wondering if being this generic is a good thing. At what point do you start making code more explicit Is there a standard approach to getting values out of a function genericallyp

Negative 20573 pGents, Im trying to have an image that is set as the footer for a tableview. The footer image needs to change based on tapping a button in the nav bar.  The design is such that there are two buttons on the nav bar, and when the screenview is loaded, theres a certain image in the footer, tapping on one of the buttons changes it and then tapping on the other changes it back and so on.p  pI tried using a UIImage a a property and then tried to change the image and set the frame on it but that didnt work the frame wasnt set correctly. Essentially, I want to do something like thisp  precode[[self table1] setfooterview  [[uiimageview alloc] initwithframeCGRectMake 0,0,50,50] and then I also need to add initwithimage[UIImage imagenamed hello1.png]]  codepre  pbut the issue is I cant do two init methods in the same statement. And I cant create an object like UIImageView hello or whatever since I need to use this in a different method later on In the method where I handle the presses of the different buttons. Later on, Im using a simple if statement and then triggering the image on the footerview based on which button was pressed. My guess was that I might have to do something likebr     [[self table1] setfooterview [[uiimageview alloc] initwithframe CGRectMake 0,0,50,50] and then do a set image but I think since setimage is not valid, I might need to cast it in some way. How would I do thisp  pSorry for the terrible syntax and please ignore all the syntax errors, since my mac is not with me at the moment and Im just typing this from memory and Im new to iOS programming. p

It does. I also want it to spin around 360 degrees. I included a little js function to do that, but it doesnt work. It works with any other value but not 360 I think that it is trying to simplify it by converting 360 to 0 because it is the same for most things, but not animations.

Negative 20573 pI am wondering about how often the Play Store updates its cache. The thing is I am going to be implementing managed purchases  once you buy you dont buy again. The thing is I have been reading around and alot of people say that the Play Store does not update its cache very often.  The scenario. User makes a purchase on phone, then going to the tablet he does not have that purchase on the tablet, and querying the tablet does not show that that item has been purchased.  How can I force the google play store cache to update without asking the user to purchase the item again which will usually update the play store cache, as it comes back that the item has been purchased already.p  pSo again how often does the Google Play Store update its local cache, and if it is just at device start and purchase request, is there another way to force the cache to update.p
Negative 20573 pI need a query that takes selects a bunch of entries, and then with those entries selects a bunch of rows into a single row. A typical entry is shown below, along with what a typical result would need to look like.p  precodetable1 id  3       table2 id      value       table1  5       value1      3 6       value2      3  table3 id      value       table1  9       value3      3 10      value4      3  table4 id      table1  14      3 15      3  table5 id      value       table4  19      value5      14 20      value6      14 21      value7      15   result result1 result2     result3     result4  3       value1      value3      value5, value6 value7 codepre  pOnly the first result of Table 1 and Table 2 are needed. Table 2 can often be null, value3 would need to go into result2. At the moment I select each entry with a statment like below which only returns result1, and then for each entry I do seperate queries for each resultp  precodeSELECT DISTINCT id FROM      complicated select in here  AS temp codepre  pAnd then for each id separably executep  precodeSELECT value FROM table2 WHERE table1  id LIMIT 1  SELECT value FROM table3 WHERE table1  id LIMIT 1  SELECT value, table4.id FROM table4, table5 WHERE table4.id  table5.table4 AND table1  id codepre  pand use code to format it into something like the results table.p  pThe problem is only the first query is done on a background thread, while the rest of them are done on the UI thread. Id like to do it all in one query, but am having trouble table4 into a single row and only selecting the first result of table2 and table3.p

Negative 20573 pI am programming a small game in C as an exercise, and Ive come across a conundrum.  The basic idea is that a codeLevelcode has a codevectorcode of codeEntitycode, and each codeEntitycode instance knows which level it belongs to. Pretty straightforward so far.p  pI was getting some nasty compile errors in my Entity class as it couldnt figure out what codeLevelcode was. A simple strongforward class declarationstrong right before the declaration of codeEntitycode easily fixed that. However, I am already including codeLevel.hcode in codeEntity.hcode. And codeLevelcode and codeEntitycode are both declared and defined in the same namespace. p  pNote codeEntity.hcode also includes codeLevel.hcode.p  precodeinclude Level.h  namespace GameNS      Required, otherwise the compiler complains   class Level    class Entity      public   ... codepre  pShouldnt the compiler already know what codeLevelcode is, by the time it reaches codeEntitycodep

Negative 20573 h3Primary Questionh3  pI have a single form which, depending on various underlying metadata will display different variations of a form.  In a single case, only in the deployed application works fine in dev and qa environments, one variant of the form causes a 500 Internal Server Error.  Ive examined the data sent back to the server in both the dev and live environments, and theres no difference at all.  p  pThe question is, how can I track down this 500 error  I have elmah installed, and its not getting tripped.  Ive set a Logging statement as the first action in my POST handler, and it never executes.  Ive set codeltcustomErrors modeOffgtcode in my web.config, and it doesnt show me a better error message. The only thing I can think of is that I have some kind of routing issue, but that doesnt really feel right since the same data works just fine to route for other servers.p  pSo, what else can I do to track down this elusive bugp  h3Background Infoh3  pI have a reporting module in the app that Im building, and it is metadata driven.  Once they select which report they wish to execute, the software pulls up the metadata for the report, figures out what parameters need to be collected, and displays a form to gather them from the user.  Once the user has filled out the form, they click a button, which submits the form via a jquery .ajax call.  The controller should pick up the incoming form post, validate the form data, and then either redisplay the form or return a json with a url to present the report renderer action.p  h3Route Configh3  precodepublic class RouteConfig      public static void RegisterRoutesRouteCollection routes          routes.IgnoreRouteresource.axdpathInfo           routes.MapRoute              name Default,              url controlleractionid,              defaults new  controller  Home, action  Index, id  UrlParameter.Optional                   codepre  h3Ajax Post Codeh3  precodevar ajaxUrl  this.action var ajaxType  this.method var ajaxData  this.serialize .ajax     url ajaxUrl,     type ajaxType,     data ajaxData,     success         functionresult               did we get a JSON back from the server             if typeofresult  object  deal with the return result...                    if window.console console.log reportParam form submit passed validation                 popupDialog.popupclose                 need nonajax version to go to url so we get a dom refresh  we want a new page also                  window.location.href                  window.openresult.URL, blank              else                  if window.console console.log reportParam form failed validation                 popupDialog.htmlresult                 popupDialog.triggercreate                 var RPT  RevTrak.Portal.Report                 RPT.Index.initBindings                      ,      complete function           if window.console console.log paramEdit form submit ajax call complete this indicates we passed validation     ,     error functionxhr, textStatus, errorThrown          var sErrMsg           sErrMsg  paramEdit form submit error          sErrMsg  nn    textStatus   textStatus         sErrMsg  nn    Error Status   xhr.status         sErrMsg  nn    Error type   errorThrown         sErrMsg  nn    Error message   xhr.responseText          if window.console console.logsErrMsg         alertsErrMsg       codepre  h3Thanksh3

Negative 20573 pI was looking through the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiJavabytecodeinstructionlistingsJVM bytecode instructionsa and was surprised to see that all the interactions between classes e.g. casting, codenewcode, etc. rely upon constant pool lookups for identity of the other classes.p  pAm I correct in inferring that this means that one class cannot know about the existence of more than 64k others, as it is impossible to refer to them  If one did need to refer to that many, what ought one dodelegate the work to multiple classes each of which could have their own lt64k interactionsp  pThe reason this interests me is that I have a habit of writing code generators, sometimes producing thousands of distinct classes, and that some languages e.g. Scala create classes prolifically.

Negative 20573 pI need to dynamically create a graph, from a mysql query which results change according to the user.  I have worked with stronggraphvizstrong and found it works fine for me.  I have created graphs before, using a table structure that allows me to do the work.  But this time,  the table structure is different and I cannot find an easy way to query the table and generate the graph.  Graphviz requires nodes to be sentenced like couples,  say codeAgtB BgtCcode.  My actual issue is that the table has a different structure, each row instead of being codeparentgtsoncode,  contains the whole branch.  So if I query,  I get something like codeAgtBgtCgtDgtEcode.  The data is queried from a view which doesnt have ordinals or indexes due to the fact it contains aggregated values.  My question is how can I query data in the graphviz required form  Is there a way to ordinate or index a view.  Thanks p

Negative 20573 pI created a PHP script for generating image files, now I am using a combination of IMagick, ImageMagick to generate the JPEG image files. p  pNow the problem is that at a time a group of image files are generated, each group containing 4 image filesFront, Back, LeftSide, RightSidep  pNow usually the size of the Front image file is somewhere between 2Mb4Mb while the size of Back Image file is anywhere between 1Mb1.5Mb and that of the Sides are just 500Kb each.p  pNow as you can see the file sizes are big as the resolution are also big like 3600x3600 for both the Front and the Back as for the Sides it is 200x3600 strongWidthxHeightstrongp  pNow the problem is that sometimes this script for genereting these files run perfectly fine but at other times it just stops without completely generating all the files.p  pLike for example sometimes it will create all the 4 files, but at other times, it will stop at the Front Image file or maybe after creating the Front it will stop at Back Image file.p  pAnd when this happens sometimes the apache webserver just stops responding, I mean it just hangsup and I have to restart it through the SSH Client.p  pI am fairly new to the platform of PHPApacheMySQL so I am still learning, so I apologize if I am making some stupid mistake, but I have no clue what is happening or why is it happening.p  pI am assuming that the problem could be due to WebServer overloading because it takes the Server entire 45 seconds to generate the Front Image file then 23 seconds to generate the Back Image file and about 1 second to generate each of the Side image files.p  pSo if it is due to WebServer getting overloaded can someone please tell me how can I avoid itp  pAlso what is the purpose of buffer setting in php.ini file, I mean could this effect the outcome when the server is getting overloadedp  hr  pSorry I forgot to mention that I also checked the error logs, no errors over there, Also the execution time is set at 60 minutes, Max memory usage is set at 512Mb for this particular script.p  pThe problem is that this problem is rare, I mean the script will execute perfectly fine for 8 times out of 10. So there is no pattern over here its totally random.p  hr  pAlso this script is running in the background, I mean some other script make a asynchronous AJAX Request to the strongImage Generation Scriptstrong, the image generation script simply runs in the background generating the image file, it doesnt return any output and it also ignores any userabort, so the user is free to close the browser once the AJAX Request has been made to the strongImage Generation Scriptstrong.p  pAnd Yes I tried to run this script in the Foreground by running it in an new tab of the browser window, if the script ran completely then no output as expected, only that when I check the files all the 4 files are there in complete form.p  pBut when there is an error, I just get a message on my FireFox browser that the connection to the Server has been resetthis message is given by FireFox and not by my code in FireFox format, after this when I check the files I see that only some of the 4 files have been created. Also the timeout for this script has been set to 60 minutes. The FireFox connection reset error gets displayed within 2 minutes time. The maxtimeout setting in PHP.ini is set at 30 minutes.p  pAlso its not like it always creates a problem if the script is taking 2 minutes time to complete its work, sometimes the script takes 34 minutes time, but finishes the work and sometimes it just stops working after 102030 seconds so it is very random. I checked the code multiple times and there is nothing wrong over here because if it were then the frequescy of this problem would have been much higher, right now it is only 1020 of the time.p

Negative 20573 pI am writing a Java program using JNA that should attach itself to another process and invoke functions at various addresses within that process memory space.p  pI have set JNA as a dependency as well as the platform contrib that is part of the JNA project, however I notice that within the Kernel32 class there is no mapping to codeVirtualAllocExcode, codeWriteProcessMemorycode, and some others. I believe that those functions are needed for this task, but perhaps there is a better way or maybe they have been implemented somewhere else.p  pIs there a way to do it using the win32 platform contrib If so where should I look If not are there any other options, or will I have to map those functions from Kernel32 on my ownp

Negative 20573 pstrongConsider a row of n coins of value v1,v2.......,vn. We play a game against an opponent by alternating turns. In each turn a player selects either the first coin or the last coin from the row, removes it permanently, and receives the value of the coin. Determine the maximum possible amount of money we can definitely win if we move first.strongp  pMy Solutionp  pSince we go first, we can either choose v1 or v2, and then our opponent can either pick from the start or from the beginning. Hence four subproblems that may arise are.p  p1,1 , 1,2, 2,1, 2,2p  pWhere 1,1 means, that I pick from starting [i.e. 1] and opponent picks from starting too[i.e 1].p  p1,2 means that I pick from starting but opponent picks up the last.p  pHence if codeMi,jcode is the max value over i,j that I can pick, then representing i,j as  recursive function.p  precodeMi,j  Max Max Mi2,j, Mi1,j1   vi, Max Mi1,j1, Mi,j2   vj  codepre  pExplanation  When I have i..j elements, then I can pick the first one [ i1 ] , and to that, my opponent can pick either the first [i2] or the last one [j1], and Id like to have the maximum the next time I pick, hence the first term inside the outer Max.p  pThe second one is analogous to the above i.e. If I pick the last [j1] the opponent picks either first [i1] or last [j2] and I maximize it next time.p  pNow, in the book I saw the recursion as p  precodeMi,j  Max Min Same   vi, Min Same   vj  codepre  pNow, why do I minimize here. Wont it be equivalent to saying that I maximize for the first time I have to pick, but minimize for the second time I have to pick.p  pWhat am I doing wrong  Thanks.p

Negative 20573 pThe title sounds like a bit unclear and I am not sure about the terminology. But my problem is I am now implementing the license verification function of our software, which consists of several modules. For example, the function call is something like codeLicense.IsModuleEnabledm As Modulecode the code is in VB.NETp  pNow the thing is, it is common for one module to require another module as a prerequisite, for example, for ModuleA to run, ModuleB must be enabled as well. So in codeModulecode class I have a public number called codeRequiredModulescode which is a list of codeModulecode. So the codeIsModuleEnabledcode function would look something like thisp  precodePublic Functionm As Module    ...         For Each module In m.RequiredModules        If Not IsModuleEnabledmodule Then Return False    End For    ... End Function codepre  pThe problem is obvious but the solution is not to me if ModuleA requires ModuleB, and ModuleB requires ModuleA, the function would go to a dead loop. p  pThose modules they are parallel to each other so I dont have a clue how to manage such a verification function. Our current solution is that only some basic modules can be listed in the codeRequiredModulescode, but for long term, to have all modules possible to appear in the list would be better.p

Negative 20573 pI am trying to integrate PayPal with Google Analytics ecommerce tracking using PayPal IPN API. I know there are few questions here on SO similar however none is answering my query. p  pI am using PayPal Buy Now buttons so the customers are leaving the main site and the purchase is happening on PayPal site.p  pThe PayPal IPN listener part is already written in PHP and I think is OK. I can also send the PayPal data as a transaction in GA using the GA API addtrans, additem and tracktrans. This is not a problem.p  pWhat I am not able to figure out is how to link the initial GA user data [where they came from, what they clicked etc] with the particular PayPal purchase remember the purchase itself is happening on PayPal site and not on the main site.p  pI found this link in which a solution is suggested however there are no specific details about how this might be implemented in a PHPJavaScript script.p  pa hrefhttpmarketlytics.comblogaccuratelyintegratepaypalwithgoogleanalyticsecommerce relnofollowhttpmarketlytics.comblogaccuratelyintegratepaypalwithgoogleanalyticsecommerceap  pBasically, the question is, stronghow the following words can be mapped to a PHPJavascript scriptstrongp  blockquote   pTo make this work we started with identifying a user when they leave for paypal to make  a purchase. This is essential because we need to be able to connect a users initial behavior [where they came from, what they clicked etc] with the final purchase. Because the user may or may not come back its essential to have a way to identify users.p      pSecond we configured IPN to send alerts whenever a transaction was completed. Using the  information from the transaction and the unique identifier we configured in the first we  had all the data we needed to tell Google Analytics about the order.p blockquote

Negative 20573 pWhile there are many questions and answers about building a storyboard layout that would work both on 4 and 3.5 screen sizes, I couldnt find a suitable solution for the following scenario.p  pI use autolayout with ios6 and ios7, and I dont have to support landscpae or ipad. I have a UIView with several subviews, which have to look as the mockup below.  It is easy to set up autolayout constraints in the storyboard to fit either of the screen sizes. My question is  stronghow do I make autolayout choose the correct constraints depending on the screen size at runtimestrongp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comDWD6y.png altSCREEN MOCKUPSp  pNote, that I DONT want to use 2 different storyboards. Doing so across my whole application would be a lot of work, and I would have to hook up all the delegates, outlets and actions on each storyboard. A change in a screen would require me to do double the work.p  pI have tried 2 methods to make this work on one storyboard, but Im not satisfied with either of them.p  ul liDouble the constraints. The larger constraint 50 has a higher priority than the lower constraint 30. The problem with this approach is that on the 3.5 screen size, autolayout may pick a just few lower priority constraints  enough to satisfy the layout  but leave some high priority constraints. li ul  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comMbIU2.png altdouble constraintsp  ul liSubclass NSLayoutConstraint. In this method, all the constraints in the storyboard are set to be NSDualLayoutConstraint. In in initialization code of NSDualLayoutConstraint, the constant of the constraint is changed to the value of 35constant in case the runtime screen size is 3.5. this method is more deterministic, but you cant see the 3.5 layout in the interface builder preview.li ul  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comtt2TV.png altenter image description here p  hr  pIf only interface builder constraints had a secondary constant value that would be applied when the screen size is 3.5, it would solve my problem..  So I remain with my question  how can I properly use a single storyboard to layout its subviews correctly for 4 AND 3.5 screen sizesp

I then proceed to go down to Web215 where there is another dropdown where I decide i want to navigate to the jQuery page.p  pWhat is currently happening is  When i click on jQuery that that single item is being given an id of current. which changes the look. But its only doing it to that single item.p  pWhat I want it to do is this If i click on just Web it will add attribute to just Web but if i click on Web  Web215 or anything in that folder  then it will highlight Web AND web215. And also  If i click on jQuery which is a third level li to Web215, then all three will have attribute current selected. and should i pick different paths or links it should follow those rules.p  pIm not sure where I need to go with it but here is the live example a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netknvH42 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netknvH42ap  pthis is where I think the problem somewhere lays Line 16 in the javascript in the jsfiddlep  precodefunction youAreHere  var pathName  location.attrpathname var curPage  pathName.substringpathName.lastIndexOf  1 a.eachfunction       if this.attrhref  curPage          this.attrid, current      else if curPage            afirst.attrid, current       END function codepre  pwhat is it that I need to do to make it so that all will be given the attribute of or id of current and not just the one.p

Negative 20573 pIm setting up some tests and it will require a decent number of phones to be usb tethered and configured.  Ive been successful in configuring them the way I want to once they have been tethered, however it would be quite tedious to tether the phones through navigating the menus, each and every time I restart my computer or move the test bank.

I should be able to handle making it into a script myself, but if its simple to provide an answer as bash script, please do.  I tried shelling into the device codeadb s deviceID shellcode and runningp  precodesetprop sys.usb.config rndis,adb codepre  pThis promptly kicks me out of the device shell and the device is no longer accessible.  If I run an codeadb devicescode I see the phone as  No Permissions at which point I have to take the USB cable out and then plug it in again, and also restart the adb server with codeadb killservercode codeadb startservercode.  This will not work because I cannot access the phone to make the configuration changes that I need.p  pIve googled around but have been unable to find anything fruitful. Any suggestionsp

Negative 20573 pomparing anything with codeundefinedcode has been discussed many times, but today I had to compare items in arrays and, at some point, items in the array could be codeundefinedcode and I was curious how they will compare to each other. I found that codeundefined  undefinedcode is codetruecode, but at the same time codeundefined gt undefinedcode is not codetruecode. Wait a second, if something is equal, then greaterorequal also mean to be true That is how logic worksp  pI can accept anything that ECMA Standard is saying, I believe those guys are sane and have a good reason for everything. But what on the earth could be a reason for this comparison behavior If I was implementing codeundefinedcode I would return codeundefinedcode for any comparison that has codeundefinedcode as an operand. But they choose to return codebooleancode, and then why the results are like thisp  pNow I think the best solution is just to handle any appearance of codeundefinedcode in a special way with multiple of codeifcode statements.p  precode    undefined  undefined true     undefined  undefined true      undefined  undefined false     undefined  undefined false     undefined lt undefined false     undefined gt undefined false     undefined lt undefined false     undefined gt undefined false codepre
Negative 20573 pBackground One of the Finger Exercises in my introductory textbook has me try to write such a program to teach me how to use a tryexcept block. The textbook is designed to accompany the 6.00x class on edX, an MIT MOOC. This isnt part of the online class itself, but merely some practice to get me to understand tryexcpet blocks.p  pHere is my code so farp  precodedef sumDigitss Assumes s is a string    Returns the sum of the decimal digits in s        For example, if is is a2b3c it returns 5     try         digitsum  0         for i in s             digitsum  inti       except TypeError         return You have hit a TypeError      except ValueError         return You have hit a ValueError      return digitsum codepre  pSo, what Im having trouble with is knowing what to put into the except clause. The text I put into the two except clauses are there because I just wanted my program to run. Im assuming the interpreter goes through a string like 456ab, hits a, then prints out the text I told it to return when it inevitably hits a ValueError. How do I get it to ignore the alphabetical characters in the string, and just make use of the numbers in the string, all in the context of a tryexcept blockp

Negative 20573 pI am currently designing the architecture for an multichannel commerce system which will have multiple different frontend presentations which are tailored to device and channel user type and location. The challenge Im facing is how to best ensure we are developing the core commerce platform in a way that reduces duplication in the frontend presentation tiers.p  pHere is a sampling of the different frontend presentations tiers we will need to supportp  ul liTraditional desktop based website for consumerli liMobile optimized website for consumerli liNative mobile applications iOSAndroid for consumerli liCustomer Support Center website for customer support representativesli liInstore kiosk based website for consumers shopping in brickmortar locationsli liOther microsites and other utilizing various technologies such as Angular, PHP, .NET, etcli ul  pNow, I know the best practices around a layered architectures presentation, business, data tiers and common design patterns to address frontend challenges within a single app such as MVC, validators, interceptors. However, none of these principles explain strongemhowemstrong and strongemwhereemstrong to best encapsulate your presentation specific business logic when faced with supporting multiple frontends.p  pSo, my question is strongemwhat are some good practices and principles to follow when developing such a system to ensure each frontend application is not duplicating frontend business logicemstrongp  pI have developed many applications with requirements like this in the past using different approaches...some of which worked fairly well and some which worked not so great. But each time I felt like I was inventing a solution for a common problem and that there must be some best practices and principles to leverage.p  h3A Quick example of the specific challenges I am asking abouth3  pAll of our frontend applications must support the ability to register a new customer account. The registration form will take in information such as email, password, and customer address information street, city, zip, etc. When the form is submitted there will be certain trivial and nontrivial validations that need to occur before the account is created in the system and a verification email is sent to the user. For examplep  ul liEmail address pattern validation rulesli liEnsuring the email address doesnt exist in the systemli liPassword complexity rulesli liAddress validation via third party address validationstandardization systemli ul  pFor the most part, these validations rules need to be enforced across all frontend systems, though each frontends registration flow might be slightly different and might only contain a subset of the fields. So, what are some good practices to provide an API to the frontends such that each frontend does not duplicate the various steps required to properly validate and process the registration For example, if we decide to change the password complexity rules or address validation rules, etc  how, might we best design the system such that we will not have to go out and change all the various frontend applications with this new validation logic. p  pJust to be clear, Im not concerned about where to put core business logic which is shared across all frontends i.e. account creation services, address validation services, account lookup services, etc. Those patterns are commonly discussed in blogs, books, and forums. My questions are specifically related to the business logic which is commonly tightly coupled to the presentation tier. Some questions that always come to my head.p  ul liShould we provide a strongempresentation service layeremstrong which supports all frontend operations including form validations and processing via web services Or should each frontend owns its presentation logic because no two frontends are alikeli liIf we do create a strongempresentation service layeremstrong, how do we provide services which address the subtle differences of each frontend Do we provide different servicesendpoints for each of these frontends or provide simply have different contexts that each frontend passes when they invoke our services  li liDoes this presentation service layer control the error messaging and return the appropriate contextually aware message to each frontend, or should we just pass back error codes and let the frontend own thisli lietcli ul

So this appears in my combobox as Widget 1.  I then edit the description and set it to ABC using this codep  pmyBusinessObject.SelectedWidget.Description  ABCpli ol  pWhen this is done, the combobox still displays Widget 1.  If I expand the combobox dropdown and choose another widget say Widget 3 and then go back and choose Widget 1 again, emthenem Ill see Widget 1 ABC displayed in the combobox.  However, even though the combobox is now displaying Widget 1 ABC, if I expand the dropdown, I still just see Widget 1.  Im guessing this might be related to the DataTemplate for the ComboBox.ItemTemplate in my XAML but Im not sure.p

The database is located on another server in our server room. p  pNo one but me has access to my development server, which holds the log files, but there is one other person who has full access to the server that hosts the database our head IT guy, who has complained that he believes he should have been the developer on this project. p  pIts very difficult for me to believe he would sabotage my data, but so far there is no other explanation that I can see.p  pAnyway, enough of my whining. What I need to know is, is there a way to determine who has done what to my database  p

Negative 20573 pI have a scenario where I want to pass some JSON to Breeze and use my JsonResultsAdapter to search for entities at the top level nodes.  I think this would be really beneficial for returning updated entities in things like results from a POST operation.  ie. Business Logic on the backend receives an updated entity that associates new entities to the parent entity, then returns them in the successp  pI know I could copy  paste my JsonResultsAdapter code into a new module to search for the entities and then materialize them with a createEntity and then override the entityState, but I wanted to check first whether this was possible natively.p
Negative 20573 pI am having some difficulty conceptualizing how to access a specific CustomEvent.p  pHere is my issue.p  pI have a codenameform.htmlcode that I import in codenok.htmlcode and codept.htmlcode.p  pcodenameform.htmlcode has a custom event that publishes the observable model for the form. This published model is then subscribed to by the detail parameter of the CustomEvent. The problem is although I have three different forms to capture a name each with a different context, codenameform.htmlcode will fire the same custom event.p  pMy thoughts are that I will have to duplicate the codenokform.htmlcode 3 times and change the customevent name to listen to it it the appropriate context. Although this works, you can see how the code gets bloated for each duplicated file, just to change the published event. p  pAny ideas how I could accomplished this otherwise would be appreciated.p  pThanksp  pstrongeditstrongp  pThis is just to add the missing code.p  pstrongnokform.htmlstrongp  pre classlanghtml prettyprintoverridecode    ltDOCTYPE htmlgt      ltpolymerelement namenameformgt       lttemplategt         ltformgt          ltsection idfirstgt            ltlabel forfirstTxt gtFirstltlabelgt              ltinput idfirstname              namefirstname              typetext              valuename.first              required              onchangesubmitgt           ltsectiongt              ltbutton idsubmitbtn               typesubmitgtltbuttongt           ltformgt        lttemplategt         ltscript typeapplicationdartgt          import packagepolymerpolymer.dart         import darthtml            CustomTag nameform          class NameForm extends PolymerElement                     observable Name  name  new Name            NameForm.created  super.created            void submit  Event e, var detail, Node target                           [ submitbtn ].click              [form].onSubmit               .listen  e                                         dispatchEventnew CustomEventnameEvent, detailname                       e.preventDefault                                               ltscriptgt     ltpolymerelementgt codepre  pstrongnokform.htmlstrongp  pre classlanghtml prettyprintoverridecode  ltDOCTYPE htmlgt    ltlink relimport hrefnameform.htmlgt    ltpolymerelement namenokformgt     lttemplategt        ltnameform idnameform onnameEventuseModelgtltnameformgt        lttemplategt       ltscript typeapplicationdartgt        import packagepolymerpolymer.dart       import darthtml         CustomTag nokform        class NokForm extends PolymerElement                  NokForm.created  super.created          void useModel  CustomEvent e, var detail, Node target                      This output will be the same as for patientform            since the event detail is the same           print  e.detail.fistname                        ltscriptgt   ltpolymerelementgt codepre  pstrongpatientform.htmlstrongp  pre classlanghtml prettyprintoverridecode  ltDOCTYPE htmlgt    ltlink relimport hrefnameform.htmlgt    ltpolymerelement namepatientformgt     lttemplategt        ltnameform idnameform onnameEventuseModelgtltnameformgt        lttemplategt       ltscript typeapplicationdartgt        import packagepolymerpolymer.dart       import darthtml         CustomTag patientform        class PatientForm extends PolymerElement                  PatientForm.created  super.created          void useModel  CustomEvent e, var detail, Node target                      This output will be the same as for nokform            since the event detail is the same           print  e.detail.fistname                        ltscriptgt   ltpolymerelementgt    class Name       String firstname       codepre  pstrongQuestionstrong How can I get the nameform.html to send the CustomEvent to either nokform.html or patientform.html.

Negative 20573 pFor example, lets say that we can classify all planets into water, earth, and air.  Each of these can be identified by a number of quantitative characteristics, such as albedo, size, and temperature, which range in values from 110 and are distinct for each type of planet.  If I have inputs for these characteristics, how do I format the neural networks output to output a result as water, earth, or airp  pFrom my limited knowledge, my experience tells me that there are at max only two outputs to an artificial neural network that will, at the end, only result true or false or indeterminate. With one output, there are step functions where the output is 1 if the threshold is crossed, and 0 if the threshold is not crossed, or linearsigmoidal that can also determine indeterminate.  With two outputs, if one output is larger than the other, then the overall output is 1 or 0.p  pHow would I implement a neural network with more than two overall outputs  My scope is only a truefalse output, although I feel that the solution may be quite simple and something that I overlooked.  Furthermore, are there any resources to help me with this  The queries Ive made havent been the most successful.p

Negative 20573 pI know there are similar questions out there, but Ive gone through all of them to no avail.  p  pI have no idea what Ive done with my south migration history.  Another person on our team included a third party app.  I tried to use south to sync it upI cant really give you steps at this point, as Ive initialed and faked and deletedghostmigrations in so many different combinations that I cant imagine how messed up Ive made things.  p  pAt any rate, Im getting a variety of Table suchandsuch doesnt exist or no such column and the like.  While Id prefer not to delete my database and start fresh, thats an option if theres nothing better however, I cant seem to figure out how to do that either.  p  pBecause its a thirdparty app causing the trouble, I cant seem to find where the migrations for it are stored in the first place.  p  pHeres the most recent stacktrace.

but never shows the twitter feed for the first person, the app runs past this point and shows the second persons feed then throws the listed stacktrace, or alternately shows a stack trace error that the first persons view was not displayed  the feeds are stored in a text file and declared in the androidManifest.xml since the emulator cannot actually connect to the web the text file was prewritten and declared in the manifest by the instructor so i dont beleive the issue lies with any of that, im new to Java programming and im not very well versed so im sure i screwed it up somewhere in the second .class file.p  phere is the LogCat with just the Tag for the android runtime as it is what referenced the fatal error, i am so new i dont know where i am looking for the line number.p

Negative 20573 pSo frustrated here. Im not a DB Admin but can get around. Im writing some ODBC queries against a Progress OpenEdge database that we only have view access to. For the longest time there have been no problems until recently they changed the data structure and for who knows why, they moved customer phone numbers into their own table called contact whereas before they were in cif, where the address etc still remain.p  pInstead of creating the contact table with one row for for each customer and fields for each phone number, they use a code of 04, numberemail, and customer. So if a customer has 4 phone numbers, they have 4 rows with different code, contact fields and customer name repeated.p  pIm trying to join the contact table with the cif table so it returns each mention of customer in cif no matter how many times it is listed in cif, but include all phone numbers associated from contact in each line.p  pTable structure simplified is like sop  precodeTable contact  code    contact   customer    0   1234567890  ABC Corp   1   1234567891  ABC Corp   0   9876543210  CBA Inc   Table cif  customer  binlow  binhigh  ABC Corp   50.45    134.66 ABC Corp   64.45    188.99 CBA Inc    12.56    890.33 codepre  pWhat Im trying to return is a joined row for each row in cif but include all numbers from contact so the table above would returnp  prsRow1 ABC Corp, 0, 1234567890, 1, 1234567891, 50.45, 134.66p  prsRow2 ABC Corp, 0, 1234567890, 1, 1234567891, 64.45, 188.99p  prsRow3 CBA Inc, 0, 9876543210,,, 12.56, 890.00p  pWhat I do NOT wantp  prsRow1 ABC Corp, 0, , 50.45, 134.66p  prsRow2 ABC Corp, 1, , 50.45, 134.66p  prsRow3 ABC Corp, 0, , 64.45, 188.99p  prsRow4 ABC Corp, 1, , 64.45, 188.99p  prsRow5 CBA Inc, 0, , 12.56  890.00p  pMake sense I can get it to work by one rs on the cif table and during each repeat region, perform another query on contact using the cif.customer as a WHERE filter but obviously it is extremely slow and would result in potentially thousands of queries.p  pI can get it to return only 1 line from cif but only 1 number from contactp  porp  pI can get it to return up to 5 duplicate cif lines with the 5 different phone numbers for each.p  pSo in a nutshell, how can I efficiently get 1 row from cif while listing all 5 phone numbers from contactp

I dont want to prompt the user, because the script fetches data from multiple SVNGIT repositories with single usernamepass so I want to read the credentials once via the script and then pass them to git pull or svn up commands p

Negative 20573 pI would like to confirm the expanation to some things Ive been trying to understand.p  pI have two scenariosp  pstrongScenario 1strong I have one list stored in a private field of my class, I make a deep copy of it and store it in other private field. After doing so, I make some changes in the list, but I can choose to retrieve its original state. For doing so, I assign the copy of the original listto the modified onep  precodePublic Class ClassX     Private myList As ListOf Double     Private myOriginalList As ListOf Double      Public Sub New         myList  New ListOf Double         myOriginalList  ObjectCopier.ClonemyList     End Sub      Private Sub Main         ChangeMyList         myList  has one element         RevertChanges         myList  has zero elements     End Sub      Public Sub ChangeMyList         Dim r As New Random         myList.Addr.NextDouble     End Sub      Public Sub RevertChanges        myList  myOriginalList      End Sub End Class codepre  pDoing so, makes everything work as I would expect.p  pstrongScenario 2strong The idea is pretty much the same, make a deep copy of one list for allowing the retrieval of its original state. However, in this case, the list is passed to another object, which makes a deep copy of it, modifies it, and decides to save those changes or revert them. And by doing so, I cannot get the desired behaviour, since the list is changed even when I make the assignment myList  myOriginalList. Codep  precodePublic Class ClassX     Private myList As ListOf Double      Private Sub Main         Dim myList As New ListOf Double         Dim c As New ClassYmyList          c.ChangeList         myList has one element         c.RevertChanges         myList still has one element      End Sub End Class  Public Class ClassY     Private myList As ListOf Double     Private myOriginalList As ListOf Double      Public Sub NewByVal c As ListOf Double         myList  c         myOriginalList  ObjectCopier.ClonemyList     End Sub      Public Sub ChangeList         Dim r As New Random         myList.Addr.NextDouble     End Sub      Public Sub RevertChanges         myList  myOriginalList     End Sub End Class codepre  pSo the question is... why Why can I revert changes this way in the first case, but not in the second Why changes made to the list passed as reference to ClassY are saved, but an assignment is not transmited to the original list in ClassXp  pHope it makes sense Thanksp

Negative 20573 pIm trying to implement a message level encryption. Here is the current situationp  pWe have a mobile app client connects to server via oneway certificate https and we have usernamepassword authentication and secure token for subsequent client to server invocations. So intention of message level encryption is not try to prevent 3rd part sniffing information or stealing client identity, instead to prevent the client user himher self to something like,p  p1 Inspect and try to understand server  client protocol 2 Forgery request with other application than our app clientp  pThe initial idea is to use symmetric algorithm DES, AES, or some simpler algorithm, as long as it could not be simply cracked by statistical or mathematical method without knowing the key. And the key is generated from a hash SHA etc from a string concatenated from a salt preagreed between client and server, and some information server tell client in nonencrypted content for instance, the first call from client to server happens in nonencrypted context, and server returns a timestamp to client and also remember it for later key generating.p  pDoes this do what I want to do for 1amp2 And what is the major vulnerability if anyp

Negative 20573 pI have one confusion about a design problem so usually in the server loop if we accept a new client, we spawn a new thread to handle the connection.

How do you usually deal with this case in Java I dont want to limit the number of connections to be a small number. Can eventdriven socket programming solve this problem p

Negative 20573 pI have an app where I am downloading a lot of small images and saving them to the SD Card. The files are mostly small around 100kb, and are being saved to the SD Card. The problem is that I am having a lot of OutOfMemory errors even thought I have set largeHeap to true. I tried using Threads to do this and it appears to not be saving all the files I have, it skips about 10 of the files 30 out of 350 files are not saved. What is the best way to solve this problem I am open to using JNI for it as well. p

Negative 20573 pIve been looking all over but cant seem to figure out if this is possible. I have a layout on which I would like to use Isotopes filtering feature, but at the same time I dont want to transform the position of the items. In other words, I dont want to use any of Isotopes layout modes. Im hoping to use position relative on the individual divs but Isotope overrides that.p  pIdeally, Im thinking it would be great if the divs could just flow as they would without Isotope being involved, but Isotopes filtering could do something like just change the opacity of the divs. For example, clicking on Dog keeps all the .dog divs at 100 opacity and sets .cat and .squirrel to 0 opacity. Would something like this be possiblep  pIn my search I found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions18367231isotopefilteringwithcsstransitionsfadeonlythis threada which gave me hope by introducing me to a hrefhttpisotope.metafizzy.cov1docsoptions.htmltransformsenabled relnofollowtransformsEnabled falsea but I dont think its quite what I needp  precodecontainer.isotope      options...     transformsEnabled false  codepre  pWith transformsEnabled set to false, my layout works as I would hope in the default state, but it also prevents the Isotope filtering from happening p  pAny suggestions Am I hoping for the impossible Thanks in advance for any help you can offerp

Negative 20573 pI have a goodish understanding of using Maven for JavaWebApp projects but only to the point of following the default goalslifecycle. p  pHowever I now have a Backup project which is not a Java project at all. I was thinking of configuring it with Maven to keep some consistency but am not sure how I override the main Maven goalsphases for my bespoke processing.p  pThe Backup project needs to do the following build  initially, the backup outputs will be a mysql database dump file and a zip exported from an existing WebApp. But I want it to be flexible so calling an ant file to do the actual work creating the dump, calling the WebApp, or doing whatever in the future seems sensible. The output files could then be copied into the target directory.p  pinstall  publish the output files to a local repository, preferably providing a datetimestamp version number instead of the usual 1.0.0SNAPSHOT version. Id like to think that Maven can cope with an artefact being a collection of files, rather than a single jarwar, but not sure on this.p  pMy pom.xml declares the packaging as pom as jar and war dont seem appropriate here.p  pI then want other projects to be able to have a dependency on this Backup project so they can get the lastest backup artefacts if required.p  p1 how do I override the maven compile goal to call an ant build file p  p2 how do I override the maven install goal to publish all files in the target directory but as a single artefactp  pAny helpguidance appreciated.p

Negative 20573 pI have written a script in Powershell that searches through a relational database using Select Top statements to pick records which are suitable to match with items in an input text file. For the sake of simplicity I not include all of the condition that need to be met, just the ones I am having trouble withp  pEach item in the input file  has a corresponding requirement for resource x and resource y.p  blockquote   pInput File br   Record 1  2x  1y br   Record 2  1x  1yp blockquote  pIn the database each record is similarp  blockquote   pDatabase br   Record 1  4x  3y br   Record 2  1x  2yp blockquote  pWhat my script does is loop through each item in my input file and searches through the database to find a record that has sufficient amount of resource x and resource y. The script does this and outputs a file which basically matches records of the input file to suitable records of the database.p  pHowever, it doesnt work properly as it step through each item in the loop, it doesnt take into account if the previous items in the loop have been matched to records and used up resources. For examplep  pThe script evaluates input file record 1 2x 1y and matches it to record 1 in the DB 4x 3y. Now when the script goes to the next item in input file 1x 1y it evaluates record 1 in the DB as still having 4x and 3y despite having been matched previously in the loop and its resources should now be looked at as 2x 2y 4x2x 3y1y.p  pHow can I accomplish this In the end the script could be evaulating 200 input records at a time against a Database with 70,000 records. The answer doesnt have to be in PowerShell, Im just having a hard time thinking of a conceptual answer to this problem.p

Negative 20573 pI hope someone can help me with this.p  pI have a Backbone based SPA for a responsive website with a .net WebAPI providing all of the data.p  pIve recently found a weird problem. Ive added a search box, which searches one of the catalogues on the system. This works fine on desktop browsers and on Android. On iOS, executing a search seems to take you back to the sign in page.p  pYou can execute a search in various ways, you can either hit enter or you can click the search icon. Both of these then trigger a method that navigates the router to the URL for the search result.p  pMy first thought was that it was some button weirdness, but I dont think thats the problem as both methods of search execution are causing the same problem.p  pThe search results are displayed in a view that is secured It requires a username to be present  this is stored in a hidden field on the page. There are two search boxes on the site  one on the home page and one on the search results page itself it shows a default set when you load it first time  which it does load first time fine. Both search boxes are exhibiting the same behaviour.p  pMy site is set up in such a way that when Backbone pulls back a model, if it gets a 401 back from the API then it will send you back to the login page, so I can only think its happening here.p  pHeres my view code...p  precode    function SiansPlan, ErrorManager, RecipeSearchResult, Header, Components, TemplateSource      var

Negative 20573 pSo Im new to Python and the first thing I started working on was a calculator. The bulk of my code goes towards addressing incorrect inputs, but I was trying to figure out if there was a way to addsubtractmultiplydivide more than just two numbers. Like allow the user to choose how many numbers they wanted to operate and then put them all into the calculation. Really Im just looking for any possible improvements, even more advanced things like getting it to differentiate or integrate functions and stuff.

Negative 20573 pIm trying to accomplish the same thing as described in this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1977295castanilisttoanilisttusingdynamicinstantiationSO Questiona. However the solutions mentioned in the responses dont resolve my issue. p  pThe API exposed to me is using the following for example, shortened for ex purpsoesp  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodeIList results  CurrentSession.CreateSQLQueryexec myStoredProc ...   .SetParameters.., ...   .SetResultTransformernew NHibernate.Transform.AliasToEntityMapResultTransformer   .List codepre  pI however need this to be a specific object of type T that is a custom object. I tried changing this to use NHibernate strongList Tstrong but no luck there either. p  pIf I try to cast this Im usually seeing an error message that states strongUnable to case object of type System.Collections.Hashtable to type ...strongp  pHas anyone encountered similiar problem and know how to castconvert this to a different type than System.Collections.Hashtable. My main goal is I need to use LINQ statements to query the results and cant do that with an IList that he code returns. p  pIm attempting to just use the API as is and not change because this is already used in other places in consuming apps. So if there is a way to work with IList and castconvert it that is best. I understand that this may be occurring due to use of the NHibernate.Transform.AliasToEntityMapResultTransformer. p  pThanks for any insight. Ive Googled and searched SO for this and not finding an answer as of yet. p

Negative 20573 pso I have a set of images that on a big screen are not using the image slider. And when the screen goes below a certain width, the image slider is initiated. p  pAt the moment, when I resize the window manually and play around dragging the size around it works well. p  pBut, if I resize the window to a small size and hit codeF5code then what should happen is that the page automatically recognises that it needs to initiate the image slider. What does happen is that the images load like this below and not an interactive image slider.p  pSo the problem is that if the page is already under 939 then the bxSlider functionality doesnt work. It will put the images into a bulletpointed list as below without actually adding the interactivity. It will also not deactivate the bxSlider when the screen is resized to above 939.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comrYi8t.jpg altenter image description herep

Negative 20573 pI am currently working on a small web interface which allows different users to upload files, convert the files they have uploaded, and download the converted files. The details of the conversion are not important for my question.p  pI am currently using flaskuploads to manage the uploaded files, and I am storing them in the file system. Once a user uploads and converts a file, there are all sorts of pretty buttons to delete the file, so that the uploads folder doesnt fill up.p  pI dont think this is ideal. What I really want is for the files to be deleted right after they are downloaded. I would settle for the files being deleted when the session ends.p  pIve spent some time trying to figure out how to do this, but I have yet to succeed. It doesnt seem like an uncommon problem, so I figure there must be some solution out there that I am missing. Does anyone have a solutionp

Negative 20573 pI am working on a legacy software product, where we from time to time gets pretty close to shipping  or do ship, changes that degrade performance a lot. The issue stem from some old design choices where a seemingly innocent change in some cause can case a huge rise in database queries for certain tasks. p  pTo be a bit upfront we would like to run some benchmark tests automatically as part of our Continous Integration build chain. p  pI have been looking for frameworks to implement test, in a mstestnunit attribute based style. p  pI have read various posts about the subject and searched Google and found a few interesting tips like this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1163143netbenchmarkingframeworks.NET benchmarking frameworksa. p  pThe tools I seem to be able to find on NuGet and Google all seems to be smaller experimental tools. And in that case I might be better of doing something we have the full control over. p  pThe question is, do any one have experience setting this up, can anyone recommend a tool, or am I best of creating my own testrunner to get something that fits our framework precisely. p  pThe basic requirements are p  ul liAble to measure either time or a number as a resultli liFor algorithmic tests determine a number of loops to run the code to get an averageli liFor database tests, be able to run something up front that doesnt count as test time e.g. clear SQL cache or setup our frameworkli liOutput data either in database or in some sort of structered format mstest trx format would be really nice for easy CruiseControl.Net supportli ul  pAdditional requirements could bep  ul liWays to group tests results, e.g. all tests of a given module or class could be bundled li liReporting abilities  show graphs, detect trends is test over time becoming slowerli ul  pAs I list the requirements it feels it might be very specific, and thus I will be better of implementing our own small framework. In that case I think something like outlined below. p  pstrongTestRunnerstrongp  ul liLook for test classes based on attribute, execute all methods with test attribute, store result either in file, direct output or databaseli ul  pstrongTestMethodsstrong p  pSomething like p  precode[Benchmark] public TimeSpan JobGetAllRowsTimeOnColdCache      Arrange     ...

Act     return MeasureMeasurement.Average, 1000,  gt Job.DoHeavyCalculation  codepre  pThe Measure class is just a wrapper over starting a Stopwatch, and do a tryfinally and return Stopwatch elapsed time in finally. p  pI hope someone has a comment on this  and ideally has experience with a framework that solves the above and is ready to use. p

Negative 20573 pIm building a mobile web app that gets information from a Symfony2 application that Ive built. There is a form that the user has to submit in order to view information, but when I submit the form via AJAX the controller that deals with it doesnt see the form being submitted. p  pThe mobile app is built with Cordova, so the form originates from a static HTML form. Once this is submitted via AJAX which will then return the data needed. However, the form submits fine triggering AJAX to do its magic, but Symfony2 doesnt see a form being submitted. I did a codevardumpcode on coderequest  thisgtgetRequestcode and the form is not included here.

Negative 20573 pI have noticed that when adding native support to a project in Eclipse, it generates a jnilibs folder. What is this folder and how is it used as I cannot find it in the NDK documentation.p  pFrom the NDK docs, p  blockquote   pa copy of your prebuilt shared library will be copied into   PROJECTobjlocal, and another will be copied and stripped into   PROJECTlibsabi.p blockquote  pI notice that when a do an codendkbuildcode, this dir gets cleaned out and a few libraries are put in it. Yet, it usually is not the case that the libraries in Projectjnilibs match Projectlibs. Also it  seems that when I install an application, jnilibs is not referenced. p  pIs jnilibs just a temp folder used by ndkbuild Is it documented anywhere, or is this an vestige of using Eclipse for native supportp

Negative 20573 pIm required to work on a serialization library in Java which must be as fast as possible. The idea is to create various methods which will serialize the specified value and its associated key and puts them in a byte buffer. Several objects that wrap this buffer must be created since the objects that need to be serialized are potentially alot.p  pConsiderations I know the Unsafe class may not be implemented in every JVM, but its not a problem. Premature optimization this library has to be fast and this serialization is the only thing it has to do. The objects once serialized are tipically small less than 10k but they are alot and they can be up to 2Gb big. The underlying buffer can be expanded  reduced but Ill skip implementation details, the method is similar to the one used in the ArrayList implementation.p  pTo clarify my situation I have various methods likep  precodepublic void putByteshort key, byte value public void putIntshort key, int value public void putFloatshort key, float value  ... and so on... codepre  pthese methods append the key and the value in a byte stream, so if i call putInt1, 1234567890 my buffer would look like the stream is big endianp  precode     key       the integer value   [0xFF, 0xFF, 0x49, 0x96, 0x02, 0xD2] codepre  pIn the end a method like emtoBytesem  must be called to return a byte array which is a trimmed if needed version of the underlying buffer.p  pNow, my question is what is the fastest way to do this in javap  pI googled and stumbled upon various pages some of these were on SO and I also did some benchmarks but im not really experienced in benchmarks and thats one of the reasons Im asking for the help of more experienced programmers about this topic.p  pI came up with the following solutionsp  p1 The most immediate stronga byte arraystrongp  pIf I have to serialize an int it would look like thisp  precodepublic void putIntshort key, int value      array[index]    bytekey gtgt 8     array[index1]  byte key     array[index2]  bytevalue gtgt 24     array[index3]  bytevalue gtgt 16     array[index4]  bytevalue gtgt 8     array[index5]  byte value  codepre  p2 strongA ByteBufferstrong be it direct or a byte array wrapperp  pThe putInt method would look like the followingp  precodepublic void putIntshort key, int value     byteBuff.putkey.putvalue  codepre  p3 Allocation on strongnative memory through Unsafestrongp  pUsing the Unsafe class I would allocate the buffer on native memory and so the putInt would look likep  precodepublic void putIntshort key, int value    Unsafe.putShortaddress, key   Unsafe.putIntaddress2, value  codepre  p4 allocation through strongnew byte[]strong, access through strongUnsafestrongp  pI saw this method in the lz4 compression library written in java. Basically once a byte array is instantiated i write bytes the following wayp  precodepublic void putIntshort key, int value     Unsafe.putShortbyteArray, BYTEARRAYOFFSET  0, key    Unsafe.putIntbyteArray, BYTEARRAYOFFSET  2, value  codepre  pThe methods here are simplified, but the basic idea is the one shown, I also have to implement the getter methods . Now, since i started to work in this i learnt the following thingsp  p1 The JVM can remove array boundary checks if its safe in a for loop for example where the counter has to be less to the length of the array 2 Crossing the JVM memory boundaries readingwriting fromto native memory has a cost. 3 Calling a native method may have a cost.  4 Unsafe putters and getters dont make boundary checks in native memory, nor on a regular array. 5 ByteBuffers wrap a byte array non direct or a plain native memory area direct so case 2 internally would look like case 1 or 3.p  pI run some benchmarks but as I said I would like the opinion  experience of other developers and it seems that case 4 is slightly almost equals to case 1 in reading and about 3 times faster in writing. It also seems that a for loop with Unsafe read and write case 4 to copy an array to another copying 8 bytes at time is faster than System.arraycopy.p  pLong story made short sorry for the long postp  pstrongcase 1strong seems to be fast, but that way I have to write a single byte each time  masking operations, which makes me think that maybe Unsafe, even if its a call to native code may be faster.p  pstrongcase 2strong is similar to case 1 and 3, so I could skip it correct me if Im missing somethingp  pstrongcase 3strong seems to be the slowest at least from my benchmarks,  also, I would need to copy from a native memory to a byte array because thats must be the output. But a hrefhttpwww.javacodegeeks.com201308whichmemoryisfasterheaporbytebufferordirect.html relnofollowherea this programmer claims its the fastest way by far. If I understood correctly, what am I missingp  pstrongcase 4strong as supported a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12226123bustedhowtospeedupabytelookuptobefasterusingsunmiscunsafeherea seems to be the fastest.p  pThe number of choices and some contradictory information confuse me a bit, so can anyone clarify me these doubtsp  pI hope I wrote every needed information, otherwise just ask for clarifications.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 20573 pI have a codeClientcode model. When viewing codeclientscode, I want to return a simple serialization of my clients, with just a few aggregate values lets say codetotalunbilledcode and codetotalowingcode. When viewing codeclients1code, I want to return a full serialization of the client, including all its nested tasks and expenses. The backend has already been configured to do this.p  pI dont want to return the full serialization of all clients when the user views codeclientscode, as there can be a lot of data under potentially hundreds of clients. Id like to load that extra information only when needed, when the user views a particular client.p  pWhats the best way to handle this usecase, where models can be serialized in multiple ways, using Ember Data I know it will cache the initial representation of the client, so if the user visits codeclientscode first, it wont ever try to fetch the full serialization of the client if the user then visits codeclients1code. Is there a sensible way to override this Or would I have to have two different Ember Data models clientside eg. codeClientcode and codeMiniClientcodep
Negative 20573 pI have a system with quite complex business logic, so far I have around 1015 database tables resources, and this number is growing. The frontend for user is angularjs single page application. The problem is communication with backend and keeping angular frontend sychronized with backend data.p  pBackend keeps all resources and relationships between them, this is obvious. And frontend fetches those resources and keeps copy of them locally to make interface much more responsive for user and avoid fetching data at every request. And this is awesome.p  pServerside has many operations which affect many resources at once. What it means is that addingremovingediting one resource via REST api can modify a lot of other resources.p  pI want frontend app data to be always fully synchronized with backend data. This allows me to keep data integrity and keep my application bugfree. Any kind of desynchronization is a big no no, it introduces hundreds of places where undefined behaviours could possibly occur in my frontend app.p  pThe question is what is the best way to achieve that My ideasinsightsp  ol lipBusiness logic modifyingeditingdeleting resources, managing relationships, keeping data integrity must be implemented only once. Doubling business logic implementation one in frontend and one in backend introduces a lot of potential bugs and involves code duplication which is obviously a bad thing. If business logic was implemented in frontend, backend still would have to validate data and keep their integrity  duplication of business logic. So, the business logic MUST be in backend, period.pli lipI use REST API. When my frontend updates one resource or many resources via PATCH method, a lot of sideeffects happen in serverside, other resources get modified too. I want my frontend angular app to know WHICH resources got modified and update them to keep full synchronization. REST returns only the resource which was originally requested to update, without other affected resources.pli ol  pI know that that I could use some form of linking resources, and to send my original updated resource with links to other affected resources. But what if there are 100 of them Making 100 requests to server is total performance kill.p  ol start3 lipI am not very attached to REST, because my API is not public, it could be anything. I think that the best solution would be backend sending back ALL modified resources. This would allow my frontend to always be in sync with backend, would be fast and would be atomic no invalid intermediate state between multiple requests to server. I think that this architecture would be awesome. The question is is this a common approach Are there any protocols  standards  libs allowing me to do this We could write it from scratch, but we dont want to reinvent the wheel.pli lipActually, I think that having business logic in frontend and backend would be good, but ONLY if it would be implemented once. This means Javascript backend application. Unfortunately, at the time being, this is not possible solution for me.pli ol  pAny insight will be welcomep  pAdded backbone.js tag, because question is much more about architecture than any specific technology.p

The problem presents almost as soon as the page loads and gets items to filter, and initially the filterType is set to Rank.p  pI have read that array.sort modifies the array in place, i.e. it does not return a new array.  Is my understanding on that count correct  .sort would not cause this problem as it is returning the same array it came in with, the items are just changed in position.  That applies to filterTypes of Money and Rank.p  pFor Tracked Players and Connections is there a better way to handle those than by creating a new array and pushing specific items into it according to the filter  While this does not appear to be the culprit in this instance, it seems to fit the mold that others have suggested as possible causes in other SO articles regarding this error.p  pI feel like I am spinning my wheels on this, I spent about 6 hours yesterday after work fiddling with this trying to diagnose and fix it.  I have narrowed it down to the filtering mechanism above, but other than that, I am having no luck.p  h1Updateh1  pThis seems to have specifically to do with Internet Explorer.  I tested the filter in Chrome and Firefox and it was only hit once per filterType change e.g. user changes the value of the Filter dropdown which in turn changes the filterType and fires off the filter.p  pInternet Explorer however repeatedly hits the filter.  And only when filterType  Rank.  I dont get that though.  Rank and Money have almost the exact same sorting scheme, just on different properties.p  pJust to be sure that this did not have something to do with the fact that I set filterType  Rank in the initialization of the controller, I changed it to all three of the other values in turn.  No problems.  This now seems specifically to do with possibly the comparison of the values WinnerPosition numeric or with some value somehow changing on the item being sorted.p  h1Stepping Through Execution Updateh1  pOK, so I may need someone to enlighten me.  The watchCollectionWatch function angular.js12307 in my case iterates through the items in each collection on the scope and checks the oldValue i.e. what was passed into the filter in this case with the newValue what came back  if the two are different it increments changeDetected signaling that a collection has changed.  When a collection changes that has a filter on it, it reruns the filter.  In my case I am changing the ordering of the collection and thus every time the filter gets run, it reads it as having changed.  How to get around thisp

Negative 20573 pstrongShould the drawing of CAShapeLayers be called from codedrawRectcode or codelayoutSubviewscodestrongp  pAccording to Apples documentation on UIViews, drawing operations should be placed in codedrawRectcode.p  pHowever this is not the case in Kevin Catheys WWDC Session a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comvideoswwdc2014411 relnofollowWhats New in Interface Buildera where he demonstrates the process of building a custom UIView that is accessible in Interface Builder.p  pDuring his demonstration he performs the drawing of the view in codelayoutSubviewscode, rather than codedrawRectcode.p  pHis explanation was thatp  blockquote   pIf I were to implement drawRect, thats not going to get us the best performance whereas, using sublayers and subviews is going to get us really good performance.p blockquote  pFrom what Ive read so far on StackOverflow, it seems that overriding the codedrawRectcode method can cause reduced performance. This is partially due codesetNeedsDisplaycode triggering manual redraws being expensive.p  pBut looking through the Apple Documentation and real world applications. It makes sense that codedrawRectcode should be responsible for the drawing of the View, and codelayoutSubviewscode handling positioning.p

Negative 20573 pUsing Rails, I have a page that displays the value of two string variables side by side with two total columns. Below that variable are some DIV blocks. When rendered, the variable will output 1 line of text in some cases, and more than 1 line of text in others.p  pCurrently, the DIV blocks below the variable are lined up only if each variable outputs the same number of text lines. If each variable outputs different numbers of text lines, the DIV blocks that follow wont be lined up.p  pHeres a simplified example of what the code looks likep  precodeltdiv classrowgt     ltdiv classcolmd6gt          lt variable.text gt          lt This div block needs to be aligned with the one in the other column, no matter how much text is outputted above. gt         ltdivgt             ltpgtContentltpgt         ltdivgt      ltdivgt      ltdiv classcolmd6gt          lt variable.text gt          lt This div block needs to be aligned with the one in the other column, no matter how much text is outputted above. gt         ltdivgt             ltpgtContentltpgt         ltdivgt      ltdivgt  ltdivgt codepre  pIm wondering how I could go about forcing the first two DIV blocks to always be lined up with each other, regardless of how many lines of text are displayed above them.p

Negative 20573 pThere are a lot of questions here about unit test event handlers in other languages, but I havent been able to find a good answer when it comes to JavaScript. Specifically Im talking about a case likep  precode inside a view class definition handleCheckboxClick function      this.relevantData.toggleSomeValue     return false    later on someCheckbox.onclick, view.handleCheckboxClick codepre  pClearly there is logic in the event handler codethis.relevantData.toggleSomeValuecode, but at the same time no other method will ever call this handler, so its not like unittesting it will catch some future refactoringrelated bug. And in any given JavaScript codebase there are A LOT of these handlers, so its a nontrivial amount of work to test them.p  pPlus, in many JS shops certainly in ours there are also featurelevel tests being done with Selenium that would typically catch obvious UI issues such as when an event handler breaks.p  pSo, on the one hand I get that unit testing of logic  good, and I dont want to shoot myself in the foot by not testing certain code if I will pay for it later. On the other hand this particular subset of code emseemsem to have a high cost and low value when it comes to unit testing. Thus, my question for the SO community is, should JS developers unit test their event handling functionsp

Everytime I recreate the component, it loses its internal state, and resets to its original state.p  pI know of course that I could store the data for it somewhere, and pass it in via props or just globally access it, but this data doesnt really need to live outside of the component. I could also hideshow components using CSS codedisplaynonecode, but Id prefer to hideshow them as above.p  pWhats the best practice herep  pstrongEDIT Maybe a better way to state the problem is to use an examplestrong p  pIgnore React, and assume you were just using a desktop app that had a configuration dialog with a Tab component called A, which has 2 tabs, named 1 and 2.  p  pSay that tab A.1 has an email text field and you fill in your email address. Then you click on Tab A.2 for a second, then click back to Tab A.1. Whats happened Your email address wouldnt be there anymore, it wouldve been reset to nothing because the internal state wasnt stored anywhere.p  pInternalizing the state works as suggested in one of the answers below, but only for the component and its immediate children. If you had components arbitrarily nested in other components, say Tabs in Tabs in Tabs, the only way for them to keep their internal state around is to either externalize it somewhere, or use the codedisplaynonecode approach which actually keeps all the child components around at all times.p  pIt just seems to me that this type of data isnt data you want dirtying up your app state... or even want to even have to think about. It seems like data you should be able to control at a parent component level, and choose to either keep or discard, without using the codedisplaynonecode approach and without concerning yourself with details on how its stored.p

Negative 20573 pAlright so I have been trying to display an integer that is able to update and reflect that on screen. e.x. Displaying the x and y coordinates for the mouse position, and it ran just how I wanted, but then I opened the good oltask manager and saw that I had reached around 600mb after running for 7 minutes. When I commented out the integers that I rendered on screenso that they would not draw or update. The program hovered around 20mb after 7 mins.

Negative 20573 pI am attempting to emulate web users using the httperf workload emulation tool to stress an experimental web server.  An issue that is widely discussed regarding the emulation of a large number of users is the file descriptor limit problem. The FDSETSIZE parameter limits the number of TCP connections that can be concurrently open, which in turn limits the number of users. p  pOne of the solutions I came across to overcome the above issue is to set higher values to this parameter as well as several other system parameters  Eg  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions848717handlingmorethan1024filedescriptorsinconlinuxHandling more than 1024 file descriptors, in C on Linuxa , a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16445074changingthefiledescriptorsizeinhttperfChanging the file descriptor size in httperfa . But once I do this, httperf crashes with a buffer overflow error, possibly because of the precompiled libc libraries in the system which use the default parameter values.p  pI have looked around for httperf patches which have which have addressed this issue and found these  a hrefhttpsgithub.comklueskahttperf relnofollowhttpsgithub.comklueskahttperfa , a hrefhttpsgithub.comrtCamphttperf relnofollowhttpsgithub.comrtCamphttperfa . The latter still crashes as the number of connections exceeds 1k, and the former complains number of file descriptors exceeding FDSETSIZE even when emulating a small number of users.p  pAnother solution I found addressing the scalability problem of httperf is to use epoll instead of the select system call in httperf relevant part of the coreloop.c source in httperf below. As I havent been able to locate an implementation which uses epoll, I have thinking of implementing this myself. Ive gone through some example code to understand the usage of select and epoll, which demonstrate how a single socket can be registered with epoll and data transfers be made upon event signals. The select call however, takes in an fdset struct object which represents an array of sockets.   p  precodevoid coreloop void    int isreadable, iswritable, n, sd, bit, mini, maxi, i  0   fdset readable, writable   fdmask mask   AnyType arg   Conn conn    while running            struct timeval tv  selecttimeout        timertick         readable  rdfds       writable  wrfds       mini  minsd  NFDBITS       maxi  maxsd  NFDBITS        SYSCALL SELECT,            n  select maxsd  1, ampreadable, ampwritable, 0, amptv        iteration        if n lt 0                if n lt 0                        fprintf stderr, s.coreloop select failed sn, progname, strerror errno             exit 1                    continue               while n gt 0                 find the index of the fdmask that has something going on          do                    i           if i gt maxi           i  mini            assert i lt maxi           mask  readable.fdsbits[i]  writable.fdsbits[i]                  while mask         bit  0         sd  iNFDBITS  bit         do                    if mask amp 1                        n              isreadable  FDISSET sd, ampreadable ampamp FDISSET sd, amprdfds             iswritable  FDISSET sd, ampwritable ampamp FDISSET sd, ampwrfds              if isreadable  iswritable                             only handle sockets that havent timed out yet                conn  sdtoconn[sd]                connincref conn                if conngtwatchdog                                timercancel conngtwatchdog                 conngtwatchdog  0                              if conngtstate  SCONNECTING                                if iswritable                                    FDCLR sd, ampwrfds                   conngtstate  SCONNECTED                   arg.l  0                   eventsignal EVCONNCONNECTED, Object  conn, arg                                               else                                if iswritable ampamp conngtsendq dosend conn                 if isreadable ampamp conngtrecvq dorecv conn                               conndecref conn                if n gt 0               timertick                                  mask  ulong mask gtgt 1           sd                while mask       codepre  pI would highly appreciate any help in modifying the select call usage to epoll in the above piece of code, or pointers to any scalable httperf implementations.p
Negative 20573 pIm trying to use Python with Theano to accelerate some code with OpenCL. I installed codelibgpuarraycode and codepygpucode as instructed I think, and got no errors. The installation detected the OpenCL runtime installed. p  pI just cannot run the Theano example for OpenCL, mainly because I dont know how to specify my GPU. My GPU is a codeRadeon HD 534054505470code, according to codeinxicode. All code in the Theano documentation uses codedevicecuda0code and the only place where OpenCL is mentioned, it says codedeviceopenclNcode where codeNcode is a number.p  pI tried codedeviceopencl0code and got a codepygpucode error saying that the correct format is codeopenclltintgtltintgtcode.

Negative 20573 pI know Im not the first who has this problem but no solution over here helped me to solve it.p  pIve two controllers a ShowController and a CreateController. I want to broadcast from the ShowController and receive in the CreateCrontroller. To do so Im using a BroadcastService. Everything works as expected. Due to a clickevent the ShowController saves data to the service broadcast the event and the CreateController receives the event an the data. Dependent on the data I want to activate a tab one the view which was initiated by the CreateController. After setting the scope variables in the onmethod they are changing but the view is not updating itself.p  pIve tried to wrap the broadcast and as well the on methods in a timestamp to force the apply. I also tried the apply after the scope variables were set and I tried to set the scope variables in an anonymous function in the apply. Non of these solution worked for me. Im obviously missing something.p  pstrongEDITstrong The a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netrnfadkk09 relnofollowfiddlea attached is working but there is not the problem. Both controllers have a parent controller. If I check the codescopecode in the child controllers the new data is added BUT if I checkt the parent controller the codechildTailcode with the child data did not changed. So the broadcast works. The problem is within the controller structure or scopeinheritance.p  pWhy does the view listen to the parent controller even if the variable is not initiated and changed in the parent controllerp  pstrongEDIT 2strong As far as I tried to locate the issue I think I found one problem.If I try to broadcast from show controller to the create controller.

In there, a query is made to get the default culture. It can be either enUS or esMX, then it is send as the second parameter. The first one is not important for now.p  pAs I said, I have a namespace named MyProject.Localization Im changing my project name since internal policies, you understand. In that folder, I have three resources filesp  ul liResources.resx li liResources.enUS.resxli liResources.esMX.resxli ul  pDefault entries in Resources.resx have values in spanish since, you know, Im mexican.p  pAlso, in my code, when I need to show a message or set a label text, I use something like thisp  precodethis.lblStatusMessage.Content  Localization.Resources.OperationCancelled codepre  pIn this example OperationCancelled is an entry that exists in all the resources files. In spanish its value is Operacin Cancelada and in english it says Operation Cancelled.p  pAfter all this story, this works great in my development environment. I run my test project, I see it in english, then I change the language in database, run it again and boom spanish. p  pBut.p  pWhen I commit changes to this project via SVN, it is then deployed to QA environment by some automated process its awesome. And then I test there and I always see the contents in spanish as the default ones. Even when I change the language on the QA database, it always shows labels and messages in spanish.p  pI tried some optionsp  pChanged the resources dlls Build Action to Resource instead of Embedded Resource. It didnt work.p  pRight clickProperties, Resources tab shows no Resources, so I created three resx files there and set custom namespace as MyProject.Localization. Next I excluded my original files since now there was some ambiguity errors. Again it worked in my dev machine but in QA didnt.p  pAny ideas about this My hipothesis is that it has something to do with the resx files, maybe theyre not included in the final built or something like that, and thats why the app cannot get the localized texts.p  pThank you in advance. p

Negative 20573 pOk guys, have a fun question I will try not to complicate that has been destroying me for weeks.p  pIn the signal integrity cable industry, it is common to collect data of a DUT using a VNA with typical settings of 10Mhz20GHz sweep. Using a program called Agilent PLTS or something similar, an IFT of some sort can be performed and gives a time domain profile that can tell you what the impedance profile of the DUT looks like.p  pNow... Cables have MAGNITUDE NOT PHASE sparameter specs to pass and have limit lines, say 10dB from 0 to 10 GHz for S11 Return Loss. Lets say a certain cable is failing a magnitude spec at 9GHz. Is there any signal processing without using gating that can be applied that can literally alter the TDR Time Domain Profile Generated from IFT using VNAFrequency Domain Data that will show me where and what exactly is causing the failure at 9GHz Im wondering if this is even possible. Im not too savy in DSP.p  pThere is a lowpass and a passband mode for PLTS TimeDomain Settings. Im trying to find more information on passband mode but not having too much luck.p  pI guess a better way of putting it is You can take a measurement. By gating the Time Domain Impedance Profile, it will tell you how the frequency domain will change. Im looking for a way to do the opposite of gating. By gating if even possible the frequency domain, can I see how this directly affects the time domain profile.p  pThanks p
Negative 20573 pDoes anyone have an idea how to develop an local client only application with brunchjade What I want I dont need a server, I want to create an application, meaning a simple web page that is run completely offline on an usb stick. Ideally it would consist of strongone htmlstrong, strongone cssstrong and strongone js filestrong.p  pCan this be done with brunch and jade I didnt really get the jadebrunch connection  I have my app now using static html pages made from jade templates. But what I would like more is to concatenate all html into one file which loads the content dynamically by javascript. The content is completely static, no need for a database.p  pI know how brunch works already have a project with it. What I dont know is How do I manage the links and the routing within the single page site without a server side part Do I need a Js library for thatp  pAny hints welcome.p

Does that make sense Will EF be able to benefit from thatp  pIf that doesnt work  and were not using EF in the way its at its best  we might as well consider using stored procedures or direct queries to the database. You save the overhead of EF altogether and at least then youre in full control of what were doing and not have EF make the queries for us behind the scenes. p  pWhat are the thoughts on that Any other suggestions are very welcome as well of course.p

Negative 20573 pSorry for the beginers question, I read a lot of post here and on the web and there is something fondemental I cant understand.p  pAs I understood, the usage of async actions in WebAPI is mainly for scalability reasons, so any incoming request will be diverted to a worker instead to a thread and by that, more requests could be served.p  pMy project consists on several huge actions that readinsertupdate from DB by EF6 many times. the action looks like thatp  precode    public async TaskltHttpResponseMessagegt Getint id           PolicyModel response  await policyRepository.GetPolicyAsyncid      return Request.CreateResponseltPolicyModelgtHttpStatusCode.OK,response      codepre  pand GetPolicyAsyncint id looks like thatp  precode    public async TaskltPolicyModelgt GetPolicyAsyncint id            PolicyModel response  new PolicyModel       User currentUser  await Repositories.User.GetUserDetailsAsyncid        ifcurrentUser.IsNew                 IEnumerableltDeliverygt deliveries  await Repositories.Delivery.GetAvailableDeliveries          ifdeliveries  null  deliveries.Count  0                      throw new Exceptionno deliveries available                    response.Deliveries  deliveries          IenumerableltLinegt lines  await Repositores.Delivery.GetActiveLinesAsync          lines.AsParallel.ForAllline gt           await Repositories.Delivery.AssignLineAsyncline,currentUser          ...       return response         codepre  pI didnt write the entire code but it goes quite a bit and it is also broken into several methods but that is the spirit of itp  pnow the question i have is is it a good practice to use so many awaiters in one method I saw that it is more difficult to debug, is it hard to maintain the thread context and for the sake of worker assignment, shouldnt I just use codeTask.Factory.StartNewcode or maybe call a simple codeTask.Delaycode so that the request will immidiatelly be diverted to a worker I know that it is not a good practice async all the way so maybe just one async method at the endbegining of the codeGetpolicyAsyncint idcode methodp  pEDITp  pas I understood the mechanics of the async methods in .net, for every async method, the compiler is looking for a free thread and let it deal withthe method, the thread is looking for a free worker and assign the method to it and then report back to the compiler that it is free. so if we have 10 threads and for every thread there are 10 workers, the program can deals with 100 concurrent async methods. so back to web developement, the IIS assign x thread to each app pool, 10 for instance. that means that the async WebAPI method can handle 100 requests but if there is another async method inside, the amount of requests that can be dealth with are 50 and so on, am I right and as I understood, I must call an async method in order to make the WebAPI method truely async and now, since it is a bad practice to use codeTask.Factory.StartNewcode, I must at least use codeTask.Delaycode    p  pwhat I really want to gain is the scalability of the async WebAPI methods and the context awareness of synced methodsp  pin all the examples Ive seen so far, they only show a very simple code but in real life, methods are far more complexp  pThanksp

Negative 20573 pIm having an issue. Im working on a simple multithread TCP server in Java, and I currently have this problemp  pClient can send me an input string, such asp  pstrong[IDENTIFIER] textrnstrongp  pwhich is okay and I have that done. Every input query needs to be ended by a emrnem, except for one case.p  pThis case is when a client send an image as a binary data. This message has following structurep  pstrongPHOTO[space][length of data][space][data][4 bytes of checksum in BIG ENDIAN]strongp  pand the whole point is to either return ap  pstrong202 OKAYrnstrongp  pmessage when checksum matches the sum of bits in data, or ...p  pstrong302 BAD CHECKSUMrnstrongp  p... otherwise. However, Im having some serious issues with reading the 4 bytes. The input source is an instance of InputStreamReader, acquired fromp  precodein  new InputStreamReaderthis.clientSocket.getInputStream codepre  pand function InputStreamReader.read return an int of a char that has been just read. Now, I tried top  precode            correctChecksumBytes  new byte[4]             for int i   0  i lt 4  i                   correctChecksumBytes[i]  byte in.read                           if correctChecksumBytes  null                    throw new BadSyntax                                      bb  ByteBuffer.wrapcorrectChecksumBytes             bb.orderByteOrder.BIGENDIAN             fourByteCheck  bb.getInt codepre  pHowever, I now understand that casting the int returned from in.read is wrong, since the result are off by a hige amount. I was lead to believe that usage of ByteBuffer is correct, I just dont know how to fill the byte array with correct values.p  pI also tried to convert the InputSreamReader into byte array, but I found out that its not a valid way to go, since a message...p  pstrongPHOTO[space][length of data][space][data][4 bytes of checksum in BIG ENDIAN][IDENTIFIER] textrnstrongp  p...is valid and needs to be interpreted as 2 messages.p  pI did some tests and found out I successfuly managed to read all the data and compute the valid checksum, so the next 4 bytes in the input are the 4 bytes of checksum, which I did not manage to read yet.p  pAlso, heres an example of a valid PHOTO messagep  pstrongPHOTO 8 ABCDEFGHx00x00x02x24strongp  pSo Id like to ask, how can I read these 4 bytes and convert them into int to compare with computed checksump  pThanks a lotp

The project structure is as usual project placed in codePluginsAndroidcode and thats all.p  pWhy is facebook project working fine and mine not I cant understand.p  pI already solved other problems by reimporting the stuff, and some months ago I managed to make zxing work in another project, but now I cant maybe updates have something to dop  pFor now my only option is to get resources by name codegetResources.getIdentifiername, defType, defPackagecode. It would work, despite of the lot of work, as Im not going to modify anything else in ZXing, but not the best option, and definitively not a general solution to work with plugins.p  pAny help, or documentation in deep unity android plugins stuff is welcome.p  pPS I added sources to unity plugins folder, so I can edit with Eclipse with no need to compile, copy and all that stuff. I cant do that for ZXing as unity creates a bunch of .meta files that makes R generation fail files can be ignored applying patterns in code folders, but R generation is done by a different processor and I was not able to set any filter, so I have to copy the project from eclipse to unity when modified.p

The currentPage variable is supposed to represent which page is currently open Home being 1, Designs being 2.  When the Designs nav button is clicked, it should check to see if that page is already open.  It works fine if it isnt it opens the page as it should, but the problem is that once the page is open, currentPage is set to 2 and so next time the button is clicked, it should trigger the else if statement where nothing happens...but instead, it triggers the if statement AGAIN, which triggers the opening animation again, which I do not want.p  pI cannot for the life of me figure out why this is happening.  I thought the code was rock solid...Ive done this many times before.  Any ideasp

Maybe with some base class or an interface, I dont know thats why I ask for.p  pSome other option that I think it might be posible is to clone the object and define a new class instead to add code to the existing one. So in that codeClasscode use the codeObjectcode to get access to the methods trhough the  codeTypecodep  pre classlangvb prettyprintoverridecodeClass NewClass       Sub AddCallbackObj As Object, Callback As Action           Add the callback here      End Sub End Class codepre  pIm just guessing, maybe some of my option are even unviable, so please help my on this p  pstrongClosest approachstrongp  pWhat I have for now, is this methodp  pre classlangvb prettyprintoverridecodeSub RunWithCallbackbeforFilter As Action, f As Action      beforeFilter     f  End Sub codepre  pThis means a lot of overloads for the codeRunWithCallbackcode to manage Subs and Functions with codeActioncodes and codeFunccodes delegates, with different number of parameters To use this, I would have to run this Sub instead of calling any of the Object methods passing codeByRefcode parameter to catch returning value in functions. Something like thisp  pre classlangvb prettyprintoverridecodePublic Sub DoNothing     Debug.WriteLineCallback working End Sub  Public Sub BeforeFilter     Debug.WriteLineTesting callback... End Sub  To run the above function     RunWithCallbackAddressOf BeforeFilter, AddressOf DoNothing codepre  pI think there should be a better solution to this, something that allow to avoid calling the same sub, and avoid the overloads, some kind of dynamic extension method for the object Class p

Negative 20573 pI have a project using gradle and springboot.  My project also produces an auxiliary jar of its test classes so that other projects can leverage them.  This seems to send the springboot gradle plugin off the rails.p  pThe docs on the plugin state p  blockquote   pThe bootRepackage task depends on Gradle assemble task, and when executed, it tries to find all jar artifacts whose qualifier is empty i.e. tests and sources jars are automatically skipped.p      pDue to the fact that bootRepackage finds all created jar artifacts, the order of Gradle task execution is important.p blockquote  pWhat Im seeing instead is that bootRepackage is just repackaging the most recently created jar, not all jars, as the documentation states.

Negative 20573 pIm creating a file editing app, and each file currently has its own JFrame. There are plenty of questions about making the frames fullscreen, and it works well in my app. However, I have a problem when I close the frames from fullscreen.p  pNormally, I set the default close operation to codeEXITONCLOSEcode.

Negative 20573 pSo I work for a small internet company and we are testing out some routers to use in homes that are ADSLRouterVoIP Gateways all in one. p  pWe are currently testing Thomson TG784 and will be using TR69 for provisioning and management.p  pHow could I set their router to a splash screen when their bill is due We are prepaid so when a customers payment is due we want to display a message displaying please pay your bill and have a html page already created. We only want this to happen when their bill is due and have the TR69 and push files to the routers at anytime and have this linked to our billing platform. p  pSo far the only thing I can come up with is to set it to got to only our splash page but this would block them from accessing until the account is paid and the change is then pushed back from the TR69 to make the change to router. p  pAny advice would be appreciated or directions to links to read. p
Negative 20573 pI am trying to implement visual odometry algorithm via matlab. According to step 2 in a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiVisualodometry relnofollowhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiVisualodometrya. I need to do image correction before feature detection, matching and motion estimation. I think I need to undistort image like the function a hrefhttpwww.mathworks.comhelpvisionrefundistortimage.html relnofollowherea in matlab. Can I use the original intrinsic and extrinsic parameter for motion estimation after matching the feature I think the intrinsic parameter is for the distorted image.p  pI am confused that in the Camera Calibration Toolbox for Matlab. The intrinsic matrix can only turn the pixel back to distorted plane. If I do image correction first before feature detection according to step 2 in wiki. I think the original intrinsic matrix would cause some error.  p

Negative 20573 pI have been making simple layouts in Interface Builder using the codewAny hAnycode view and adding constraints based on where I set the itemsp  pWhen I run the app, results are not as expected. Different devices show squinched and invisible views, different rotations show other undesired behavior.p  pSo then I go back to interface builder and set up more constraints in the codecompactcode view and in codelandscape portrait iphonecode view, and if there are errors I then let Xcode autofix them with codeReset to Suggested Constraintscode. This works, but I feel like I am trusting it too much, such as if I want to make a more complex set of layouts, or if one of these layouts dont display as desired even with codeReset to Suggested Constraintscode, then Ill be at a loss, a time consuming loss.p  pIve gone through a couple tutorials but this still seems to be a pain point for me let alone how quickly this part of Xcode gets updated dramatically. Any insight into how to do this more efficiently or get my layouts right from the beginning Perhaps there is some dynamic resizing I need to addp

Negative 20573 pI have a bit of an issue, I was recently told that for an unordered value for input, a bunch of random values, lets say 1 Million of them, that using a set would be more efficient than using a vector, and then sorting said vector with the basic sort algorithm function, but when I used them, and checked them through the time function, in the terminal, and valgrind, it showed that both time complexity, and space usage were faster for the vector, even with the addition of the sort function being called.

Negative 20573 pI need some assistance in quite a sticky situation. My program is working fine as it is but I was told to change how a class is working. What I have is a Booking Class which extends a Customer Class to get the Customer details. Now I was told that the Booking Class must have a property of type Customer instead of extending the Class. Then in my program I load the Customer as a whole object instead of reading line by line and inserting them into the text boxes.

Negative 20573 pLets say I have an application that pays users to process a certain amount of data, say 500 Mb. After the processing has completed, the application contacts an online server to notify it that the data has been processed and receive payment. Now lets say the application either loses connection to the server, or crashes in the middle of processing and we want to save how much data weve already processed. We can save this as a file on the computer, but we want to prevent the user from finding the file and modifying it, making it look like theyve processed more data and in turn getting paid for work that wasnt done.p  pThe data that is processed is not sent back to the server, so there is no way to directly verify the processing happened, the application just counts how much data was processed and notifies the server when enough has been completed to be paid. p  pHow would you secure and verify that the local counter hasnt been modified p

Negative 20573 pI am a super beginner in iOS development and I have a question regarding Core Data. I know this seems like such a stupid question but I have a really difficult time understanding what it is due to all the jargon thats involved in describing what it is. For example, a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiCoreData relnofollowhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiCoreDataa statesp  pcodeIt allows data organised by the relational entityattribute model to be serialised into XML, binary, or SQLite stores. The data can be manipulated using higher level objects representing entities and their relationships. Core Data manages the serialised version, providing object lifecycle and object graph management, including persistence. Core Data interfaces directly with SQLite, insulating the developer from the underlying SQL.codep  pAnother link a hrefhttpshrikar.comcoredataswifttutorial relnofollowhttpshrikar.comcoredataswifttutoriala statesp  pcodeCore Data framework provides a simple way of maintaining the life cycle of the objects and object graph management including persistence.codep  pAnd I searched on google, What is core data swift and most of the links are similar in their language and jargon. Therefore, it is really difficult more to understand what it does. Could you please explain what core data actually is in laymen termsp  pemP.S. I think I understand basically what core data does. It just saves data so that I can use it later But is this understanding sufficient for me to proceed in using core data Or do I need a deeper understandingem p

Negative 20573 pI am writing a code to do some very simple descriptive statistics,  but I found myself being very repetitive with my syntax.  I know theres a way to shorten this code and make it more elegant and time efficient with something like a forloop, but I am not quite keen enough in coding yet to know how to do this... p  pI have three variables, or groups All data, condition 1, and condition 2. I also have 8 matlab functions that I need to perform on each of the three groups e.g mean, median. I am saving all of the data in a table where each column corresponds to one of the functions e.g. mean and each row is that function performed on the correspnding group  e.g. 1,1 is mean of all data, 2,1 is mean of cond 1, and 3,1 is mean of cond 2. It is important to preserve this structure as I am outputting to a csv file that I can open in excel. The columns, again, are labeled according the function, and the rows are ordered by 1 all data 2 cond 1, and 3 cond 2. p  pThe data I am working with is in the second column of these matrices, by the way. p  pSo here is the dumb, tedious way I am accomplishing thisp  precodex  cell3,8  x1,1  meanalldata,2  x2,1  meancond1data,2  x3,1  meancond2data,2   x1,2  medianalldata,2 x2,2  mediancond1data,2 x3,2  mediancond2data,2  x1,3  stdalldata,2 x2,3  stdcond1data,2 x3,3  stdcond2data,2  x1,4  varalldata,2    variance x2,4  varcond1data,2 x3,4  varcond2data,2  x1,5  rangealldata,2 x2,5  rangecond1data,2 x3,5  rangecond2data,2  x1,6  iqralldata,2   inter quartile range x2,6  iqrcond1data,2 x3,6  iqrcond2data,2  x1,7  skewnessalldata,2 x2,7  skewnesscond1data,2 x3,7  skewnesscond2data,2  x1,8  kurtosisalldata,2 x2,8  kurtosiscond1data,2 x3,8  kurtosiscond2data,2    write output to .csv file using cell to table conversion  T  cell2tablex, VariableNames,mean, median, stddev, variance, range, IQR, skewness, kurtosis writetableT,descriptivestats.csv codepre  pI know there is a way to loop through this stuff and get the same output in a much shorter code.

Is there any way to check if currently processing node actually taking 2 pagesp  pMaybe if I try to define the problem, you can suggest some better solution. I have multiple topics in xml, and during processing of topic, I adding header and footer to every page. I want to change it, to not add header, on page where title of new topic is located topic starts from new page. So maybe there is better way to do what I want, than checking pages. Because I think that because of different approach to variables in functional programming, I might be not able use page as I wanted.p

Negative 20573 pI am a newbie in AngularJS and web development in general, so please excuse any emnaveem comment from me.p  pIn a small project I am working on, there is a page with a gallery to preview a set of items. Each item contains a table which lists several rows. As the items should be all equal, the tables have fixed sizes. In case not all of the rows can fit the preview, I want to show the user a clue that there is more to read. p  pA the beginning this seemed a simple thing to me, but it turned out to be a tricky thing to do. I thought to check for codescrollHeightcode and codeoffsetHeightcode properties of the table, but as it is generated via codengrepeatcode, AngularJS played me fool. I put my final solution in a hrefhttpplnkr.coeditIB8alqES6IkIiUoveH6Wppreview relnofollowthis Plunkera, but it seems too complicated to me, and I am asking if anyone has a simpler solution.p  pAfter a lot of Googling and trials, I created a custom directive for the table, which registers an handler for a custom eventp  precode    ltdiv classcolxs4 ngrepeatitem in items styleposition relativegt       lttable checkoverflowisOverflowgt         lttr ngrepeatrow in [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]  limitTo item.rowsgt            lttdgtQtyampnbsplttdgt            lttdgtDescriptionodd  , and an even longer description  lttdgt          lttrgt       lttablegt       ltdiv classmoreindicator ngshowisOverflowgt         ltspan classglyphicon glyphiconchevrondown ariahiddentruegtltspangt       ltdivgt     ltdivgt codepre  pIn the directive I set a scope variable which drives the codengshowcode according to the actual size of the tablep  precodeangular.moduletableOverflow.directivecheckOverflow,[ function    return functionscope, elm, attr        when the rendering of the gallery is completed, set the overflow      marker to show or stay hidden     scope.ongalleryCompleted, function event, data        scope[attr.checkOverflow]  elm[0].scrollHeight gt elm[0].offsetHeight         ] codepre  pThe tricky thing was to find out the right moment to fire the event I wasnt able to do it in the tables scope i.e. when the codelastcode row is available, but have to put a fake div outside the outer loop and invoke a scope function to do itp  precode    ltdiv nginitOnCompletedgtltdivgt codepre  pand this in the controllerp  precodescope.OnCompleted  function      timeoutfunction          scope.broadcastgalleryCompleted     , 200  need some timeout or wont work always on a fast browser   codepre  pAnyone can suggest a simpler solution Thank you very much in advancep  pstrongEDITstrongbr I dont like the codetimeoutcode thing, also the behavior can change across devices, PCs, etc. Thksp  pstrongUPDATEstrongbr Googling a little further, I found a suggestion, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma242286045253647in another posta, that gave me some hope, via the codewatchcodep  precodeangular.moduletableOverflow.directivecheckOverflow,[ function    return functionscope, elm, attr       var isCompleted  function        scope[attr.checkOverflow]  elm[0].scrollHeight gt elm[0].offsetHeight       console.logisCompleted   elm[0].scrollHeight     elm[0].offsetHeight          var watch  scope.watchfunction                console.logwatch   elm[0].scrollHeight               return elm[0].scrollHeight           , function                scope.evalAsyncisCompleted                ] codepre  pHowever, it doesnt works or better, not always.

Negative 20573 pIm trying to calculate SHA1 hash values in Python against binary files for later comparison.

I launched 64bit python and ran the exact same code against   the dll and as a 64bit powershell process.

Negative 20573 pI am writing an app for personal use that needs continuous background execution. Apple tries to make this difficult, but I found that declaring that my app uses background location updates and then creating background task with no content, just a blank task allows my app to run indefinitely when I run the project from Xcode. I do not understand why this works. I noticed that after about three minutes, when presumably the task is supposed to be terminated, I get the following errorp  blockquote   pCant endBackgroundTask no background task exists with identifier 174256fe0, or it may have already been ended. Break in UIApplicationEndBackgroundTaskError to debug.p blockquote  pAfter this message, the app continues to run in the background normally. So, it seems that this indefinite execution is a bit of an exploit, which Im fine with because I just want to make the app work. p  pHowever, when I run the app from the phone i.e. not pressing the run button in my Xcode project, the background execution seems to stop after 3 minutes. This is a problem, and I cant seem to figure out why execution continues in one case but not in the other. What is the difference between running an app normally and running it through Xcode Is there a simpler or better way to get the indefinite background execution Im looking for given that Im not trying to get this app published to the app storep
