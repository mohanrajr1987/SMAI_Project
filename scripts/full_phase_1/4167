Negative 4167 pFor those who are not aware, Lotus Notes is a cool system, which has very powerful database replication abilities, and very strong certificate management and signing.p  pHowever that strong certificate usage is itself one of Notess downfalls.  p  pWhen you log in to Lotus Notes via a Notes client, the password you use is not stored anywhere, except as the encryptdecrypt key to the Private Key stored in the Notes ID file on your local workstation.p  pWhat this means is that you can have 15 copies of this file, with 15 different passwords, and each one is valid, as long as you have the matching password.p  pFor Identity Management systems, this is pretty crippling, as there is no server side component to access the password change event, rather it is entirely client based, and the server can barely even tell it happenedp  pThe rumours I hear is that in later releases of Lotus NotesDomino, this ID file based authentication is starting to change. p  pI am having trouble finding clear cut explanations for what is changing, how, and in what version.  8.5  9  Laterp  pSecond part to this question is, what is happening in terms of Active Directory integration  I heard it rumoured that AD authentication might be allowed instead of ID file authentication.  My guess on that aspect is that the ID file stored on the server will still be used for authorization, but the successful Active Directory authentication will be used to unlock access to it  Or is it some other modelp  pLooking for someones perspective who has figured this out alreadyp  pOn a side note, there is a second password httpPassword  that is used when Notess Webmail is accessed, since of course the server has no access to the local ID file when the user authenticates.  One assumes this is the model they would move to for other forms of authentication, but as we all know, assuming is a bad planp
Negative 4167 pHow would you solve this problemp  pYoure scraping HTML of blogs. Some of the HTML of a blog is blog posts, some of it is formatting, sidebars, etc. You want to be able to tell what text in the HTML belongs to which post i.e. a permalink if any.p  pI know what youre thinking You could just look at the RSS and ignore the HTML altogether However, RSS very often contains only very short excerpts or strips away links that you might be interested in.

The text may also be represented slightly different in HTML vs. RSS, as described below.p  pAdditional rulescaveatsp  ul liTitles may not be unique. This happens more often than you might think. Examples Ive seen Monday roundup, TGIF, etc..li liTitles may even be left blank.li liExcerpts in RSS are also optional, but assume there must be at least either a nonblank excerpt or a nonblank titleli liThe RSS excerpt may contain the full post content but more likely contains a short excerpt of the start of the post bodyli liAssume that permalinks must be unique and must be the same in both HTML and RSS.li liThe title and the excerpt and post body may be formatted slightly differently in RSS and in HTML. For example ul liRSS may have HTML inside of title or body stripped, or on the HTML page more HTML could be added such as surrounding the first letter of the post body with something or could be formatted slightly differentlyli liText may be encoded slightly differently, such as being utf8 in RSS while nonascii characters in HTML are always encoded using ampersand encoding. However, assume that this is English text where nonascii characters are rare.li liThere could be badly encoded Windows1252 horribleness. This happens a lot for symbol characters like curly quotes.

Negative 4167 pIve just started using NHibernate and fluentNHibernate which I think is great. Ive been configuring all my mappings to use LazyLoading for any relationships between classes because generally I find it isnt neccesary to load everything upfront.

Their DAL has lots of functions that manually construct and execute SQL statements  many of them are long, messy and as a result difficult to understand and debug. I wrote a simple sql helper that lets me write things like thisp  pre sqlh.addValuename, name sqlh.addValueaddress, address sqlh.addLiteralcreated, getDate  string sql  String.FormatINSERT INTO [Table1] 0 values 1, sqlh.getInsertFields, sqlh.getInsertValues pre  pIt handles nulls and also works for updates. Thats about it.p  pIdeally I would be using Microsoft Data Application block or LINQ or something, but major architectural changes are not possible at this point. This method has saved me a lot of time, but seems like a problem best solved by using a communityapproved solution.p  pIs there a popular, lightweight solution that achieves similar results, from Microsoft or otherwisep  pstrongEDITstrongp  pWhile the SqlParameter solutions described so far are an improvement over a purely manual statement building method, I think I still prefer my solution, where adding or removing a field from the query affects only a single line. Anything better thanksp

Negative 4167 pIve got a legacy application which is implemented in a number of Excel workbooks. Its not something that I have the authority to reimplement, however another application that I do maintain does need to be able to call functions in the Excel workbook. p  pIts been given a python interface using the Win32Com library. Other processes can call functions in my python package which in turn invokes the functions I need via Win32Com.p  pUnfortunately COM does not allow me to specify a particular COM process, so at the moment no matter how powerful my server I can only control one instance of Excel at a time on the computer.

The copy occurred without errors.  When I tried to view tables in the copied DB in Access 2007, I got exceptions thrown at me.p  pWhat I found  The tables that were throwing the exceptions had extended properties tied to them.  This I traced back to saying yes to saving changes to the table layout in Access.p  pWhat I tried to do to fix this  I tried removing the extended properties through SQL Server 2005 Management Studio and recopying the DB, but this didnt fix the problem.  Upon scripting the tables I saw that the extended properties really didnt go away on the tables. p  pstrongNow to my questionstrongp  pI tracked down a table using Enterprise Manager called the emsyspropertiesem table that lies in my DB.  a hrefhttpwww.databasejournal.comfeaturesmssqlarticle.php1439771SQLServer2000UndocumentedSystemTables.htmpart5F25F8 relnofollowThis might be an undocumented tablea sigh but it looks like it has the extended property information that is causing me all of the headaches.

Negative 4167 pWhen my software is installed, via an MSI, it creates some registry keys within HKLM. When people are using the software their individual preferences are saved to HKCU.

Is this correct If so, how do I ensure the HKCU subkeys for other people who have used my software on the same machine are deletedp  pUPDATE The individual preferences that are saved in my case arent really settings that the user has chosen, but rather data that the application has stored while running for that user.

Negative 4167 pstrongI know that many people, at a first glance of the question, may immediately yell out Java, but no, I know Javas qualities. Allow me to elaborate my question first.strongp  pNormally, when we want our program to run at a native speed on a system, whether it be Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux, we need to compile from source codes. If you want to run a program of another system in your system, you need to use a virtual machine or an emulator. While these tools allow you to use the program you need on the nonnative OS, they sometimes have problems of performance and glitches. p  pWe also have a newer compiler called JIT Compiler, where the compiler will parse the bytecode program to native machine language before execution. The performance may increase to a very good extent with JIT Compiler, but the performance is still not the same as running it on a native system.p  pAnother program on Linux, WINE, is also a good tool for running Windows program on Linux system. I have tried running Team Fortress 2 on it, and tried experiment with some settings. I got 40 fps on Windows at its midhigh setting on 1280 x 1024. On Linux, I need to turn everything low at 1280 x 1024 to get 40 fps. There are 2 notable things though p  ol liPolygon model settings do not seem to affect framerate whether I set it low or high.li liWhen there are postprocessing effects or some special effects that require manipulation of drawn pixels of the current frame, the framerate will drop to 1020 fps.li ol  pFrom this point, I can see that normal polygon rendering is just fine, but when it comes to newer rendering methods that requires graphic card to the job, it slows down to a crawl.p  pAnyway, this question is rather theoretical. Is there anything we can do at all I see that WINE can run STEAM and Team Fortress 2. Although there are flaws, they can run at lower setting. Or perhaps, I should also ask, strongis it possible to translate one whole program on a system to another system without recompiling from source and get native speedstrong I see that we also have AOT Compiler, is it possible to use it for something like this Or there are so many constraints such as DirectX call or differences in software architecture that make it impossible to have a flawless and not native to the system program that runs at native speedp
Negative 4167 pI must write a program that must be aware of another instance of itself running on that machine, and communicate with it, then die. I want to know if there is a canonical way of doing that in Linux.p  pMy first thought was to write a file containing the PID of the process somewere, and look for that file every time the program executes, but where is the right place and name for that file Is there a better, or more correct wayp  pThen I must communicate, saying the user tried to run it, but since there is another instance it will hand over the job and exit. I thought of just sending a signal, like SIGUSR1, but that would not allow me to send more information, like the X11 display from where the user executed the second process. How to send this infop  pThe program is linked against Gtk, so a solution that uses the glib is OK.p

Negative 4167 pIm a little confused about how EGit workes.p  pI have an existing git repository on Github and want to clone it into my workspace.

Maybe I misunderstood something.p  pProbably this is important to know In the github repository there are no .project or .settings files from eclipse. I have them on my .gitignore and so in the importdialog I have to choose Import as General Project and not Import Existing Projects.

Negative 4167 pIm new to Django and MVT, so I apologize if this is a silly question. Ive looked over some similar questions but am looking for a little additional clarity and whether Im even attempting to do the right thing.p  pHeres a simplified version of what Im working on.

Simple structure with 4 content tablesp  ol liWidgets li liCreators for simplicity, each Widget has one Creatorli liCustomersli liOrders customer manytomany orders, orders manytomany widgetsli ol  pI started by creating a Django app called Widget that displays Widget information, and creating models for all of the tables in the database. This works great, with an url like widget1234 I get the information for Widget with id 1234, info from the Creator table, and how many times it has been ordered.p  pNow I wanted to create an app called Customer that displays information for customers data from Customer table, orders placed, widgets ordered, etc.p  pAm I doing the wrong thing Should there be a separate Customer appp  pIf it does indeed make sense for there to be a separate Customer app, what do I do about the models They are identical to the models used in the Widget app as they are dealing with the same tables in the same database. Do I just import from the other app Thanksp

Negative 4167 pI am trying to test my Spring backed JPAHibernate DAO using JUnit and H2. I have a Before annotated initialization method which loads a SQL file up and creates a base data set for each test. Transactions are setup so that after every test, its rolled back and it starts again. So, this base data set is created for each individual test, then rolled back afterward.p  pThis all works great, except I see oddness with unique constraints. I am fairly new to all of these technologies, so maybe Im just overlooking something. Id like to be able to test that the unique constraints are working as expected on certain values.p  pFirst, the init methodp  precodeBefore     public void init throws IOException               Setup default data     Query query  em.createNativeQuerygetSqlFromFile     query.executeUpdate              codepre  pNow a test method demonstrating issuep  precodepublic void testSaveExistingNonUniqueUsername       EXISTINGUSERID added in Before annotated init method     User existingUser  testDao.getEXISTINGUSERID       Set to a nonunique username also added in Before annotated init method     existingUser.setUsernameSECONDEXISTINGUSER       Save. Here I would expect an exception because of the unique constraint violation. None. Save method simply calls EntityManager.persist     testDao.saveexistingUser      Long count  testDao.countByUsernameSECONDEXISTINGUSER      Count method still returns 1     assertEqualsLong.valueOf1, count        Reload the user     User savedUser   testDao.getEXISTINGUSERID        Fails. Username is set to the nonunique value after reloading, even though the count returned 1, it appears we have two with the same username     assertEqualssavedUser.getUsername, EXISTINGUSER   codepre  pIm loading an existing user, changing the username to a nonunique value, and then saving.p  pHere is my User entityp  precodeEntity Tablenameusers public class User implements DomainObject       Id     GeneratedValue     private Long id      Columnupdatable  false, nullable  false, length25, unique  true     private String username      Columnnullable  false, length50     private String password      Columnnullable  false     private boolean enabled  true      ManyToOneoptional  false     JoinColumnnamerole, referencedColumnNamename         private UserRole role      OneToOneoptional  false, orphanRemoval  true, cascadeCascadeType.ALL     JoinColumnnamecontactdetailsid         private UserContactDetail contactDetails       .... getters and setters omitted .....   codepre  pYoull note that I also have updatable and nullable set to false for Username, yet it still allows me to make the change.p  pThe Test class itself is annotated with the followingp  precodeRunWithSpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class ContextConfigurationlocations   filesrctestresourcesspringspringtestmaster.xml  TransactionConfigurationtransactionManager  transactionManager, defaultRollback   true TransactionalpropagationPropagation.REQUIRED TestExecutionListeners      DependencyInjectionTestExecutionListener.class,     DirtiesContextTestExecutionListener.class,     TransactionalTestExecutionListener.class  codepre  pIt uses my production configuration, but I override the data source bean with an H2 datasource. Its completely vanilla, nothing fancy.p  pThe test method demonstrates that the data loaded in the init method is accessible, as the IDs are present and the entities load. However, the unique constraints dont seem to be working within this transaction.p  pHowever, in the following test, they dop  precodeTestexpectedDataIntegrityViolationException.class public void testSaveExistingNonUniqueUsername       getValidTestUser just creates a new User and fills it in with valid data.

Negative 4167 pIm in the process of porting some code from Objective C to C. Im not as familiar with C design patterns as I am with Objective C. In the Cocoa world, there is the very common pattern of writing a factory method that returns an autoreleased object. Somethings as simple asp  precode MyClass load       MyClass obj  [[MyClass alloc] init]     return [obj autorelease]  codepre  pThis is simple and easy to understand. The method owns the memory it allocates, but can hand it back to the caller, while simultaneously relinquishing ownership. It doesnt have to know or care what the caller does with that memory. If it retains it, the object will survive. If it is completely ignored, the memory will be freed sometime after the current call stack is unwound.p  pIm approaching this with some trepidation in C, because its non refcounted environment doesnt seem to have anything quite as clean as codeautoreleasecode, or any kind of ownership policy that is as well defined as those in the Cocoa frameworks. What are the best practices for this kind of pattern in Cp  pIm aware of autoptr, but there are also multitudes of concerns with its use, and it seems to have too many shortcomings to be as ubiquitous as codeautoreleasecode weird copy semantics, no support for arrays, incompatibility with STL containers, etc.p  pBoost smart pointers are also an obvious candidate, and some even implement their own reference counting. It seems a little strange to me to have to lean on a 3rd party library for something this mundane though.p  pAnother option that reeks of C would be to just emnotem release the returned memory, but indicate via come commonly adopted naming convention that the caller now owns the returned object. This seems a bit archaic, and is prone to invisible leaks should the caller accidentally ignore the return value.p

Negative 4167 pI have a 2D figure made from straight lines.p  pThe figures edges have coordinates from type double. The coordinates values are stored in an object called Dot.p  pThe data related to a line is the line ascending  or descending, the values of a and b in a  X  b  Y etc. is stored in an object called Line. The Line class also has two Dot objects for the two ends of every line. The Line class also has 2 functionsmethods and one constructor. The constructor has no arguments. The first functionmethod has no arguments and the second one has. Both functionsmethods are created in order to change all the data automatically when ever necessary.p  pI insert the number of the sides of the figure and the coordinates of the edges after I start the program. Later the program has to write on the screen everything about every line. No matter what coordinates I insert, the coordinates of the first dot are X  9,25596e061 and Y  9,25596e061. But the other dots have the coordinates I have originally inserted.p  pThere is one line that I add to a vector as much times as the number of the sides of the figure. After that I start changing the values of the coordinates of the edges of the figure by inserting the values in the running program. The third action is to call the functionmethod that creates the lines It calculates the rest of the data about the line. The fourth step of the program is to write on the screen the data about every line.p  pI have been searching for a problem in the algorithm and the code. I havent found anything.p  pIm using Visual C 2010 Express. I am also using the iostream and vector libraries.p  pSo why are the X and Y coordinates of the first edge changing their values to 9,25596e061p

Negative 4167 pWe are working on a social network application and are going to implement couple of new features. 1. Tracking online users 2. Chat one to one chat and later group chatp  pI have looked into SingalR and it seems promising. We are using ASP.NET MVC 3 and are thinking of using hubs. My question to start with is whether SignalR be better instead of simple polling for chat What will be better as far as scalability is concerned I have seen other questions on SO but was not able to find out which one of them is better as far as scalability is concerned.p  pThe second question is if we use SignalR, can we use it to also track online users. We can call a server side function from each client at regular interval to say I am online and in the hub method we can just set the isOnline bit in the DB. Once the client is disconnected we can unset the bit. Will this work or is simple polling is better here  How do we set user as offline if we use simple polling p  pThanksp
Negative 4167 pI have recently taken over a SpringJPAHibernateMaven project and Im new to Java EE development.  When this project is run, it relies on Tomcat to be started so it can access the database. From what I understand, this is known as running in a Tomcat container. p  pIm trying to get a simple integration test working and Im having trouble getting the test to successfully connect to the database. Ive set up my POM to run Tomcat in the preintegration test phase so that the integration test can connect to the database exactly how the actual application does. p  pIs this the right way to do it or is it more common to connect through some Spring basic connection in a test application context Anyone who can post some working database connection code for my spring test context would be my hero, as i havent had any luck with the examples Ive found online.p
Negative 4167 pI have a json string that I parse and then access the properties of the object with the dot notation. However, in the google closure compiler, the dot notation codeMyObject.PropertyNamecode gives warning that the property isnt defined.p  pFor now, the solution Im using is to convert my code into bracket notation codeMyObject[PropertyName]code. This removes the warning but also prevents the compiler from doing its job. On the other hand, when I write codeJSON.stringifyMyObjectcode, the server receives a string with property names that are understandable.p  pSo my question is how do we best use the google compiler in advanced mode when working with json objects that are deserialized and serialized at runtime.p  pThanks.p

Negative 4167 pIn C.NET, I like using HashSets because of their supposed O1 time complexity for lookups.

Begin HACK      DataAccessLayerBase theObjectAsRavenDalBase  theObject as DataAccessLayerBase      if theObjectAsRavenDalBase  null              theObjectAsRavenDalBase.SetAsInitialDalInstanceAndCreateSession            End HACK      return theObject as T  codepre  pThe hack that Ive implemented is casting to RavenDBs version of DataAccessLayerBase and that bifb statement. If the concrete class happens to be a RavenDB class, then I need to call a method on it. The DataAccessLayerBase, shown here, is in the RavenDb namespace. db4o also his its own DataAccessLayerBase.p  pOne way to fix this would be to have each DataAccessLayerBase implement a common method, like Initialize. The db4o Initialize method would do nothing, and the RavenDB Initialize method would perform the necessary logic. Then this method could simply call Initialize and not care which concrete class it was.p  pstrongIs there a better design than thisstrong I think the fix that I just described is decent enough, but I cant help but think Im missing something. Im looking for a better, more elegant way to solve this. One drawback with my proposed approach is that other data access layers must then implement Initialize even though I only needed it for RavenDB.p  pNote I cant just have the concrete classes do this initialization when theyre created, because it should only happen when a call is made to DataAccessFactory.GetDataInterfacelt.p

Negative 4167 pI thought that creating a simple system service under VB .NET would be a piece of cake.  Boy, was I wrong.  First, I find general postings through Google that say you should use the Windows.Forms.Timer.  Then, I found conflicting information that says you have to derive the timer from a timer class through code to make it work.  Then, people are reporting all sorts of trouble using the various types of threads available.  I cant debug threads using the VS 2010 JustinTime debugger for obvious reasons although, I dont know if there is an alternate method to doing this.  Wow, how confusing all this is when there is no definitive guide...p  pMy project is an application launcher similar to cron that will fire off periodically within a certain amount of seconds.  I am trying to use the Process.Start method.  I have a Beep function as the first instruction, and the Process.Start, along with a Process.WaitForExit method to make it block as the last instruction.  I had my code doing this through timers, but now I am starting to use threads.  No difference in execution.  The overridden OnStart method does kick off  as I am certain through debugging, but nothing ever happens when starting the service in production, as if it were ignoring all my code.  Putting loops and logic in the OnStart method yields a process that wont start.  I know it is a threading issue, but I also know it must be mandatory to use threads.  I am now dumbfounded as to how to make this work.  I am curious to know the solution.p  pIn addition to the service class, I have a ServiceInstaller and ProcessInstaller implemented that I copied verbatim from MSDN.p  pHere is some of the code I am trying to work with.  Note that this simply reflects the current state of my code in trying to implement the logic within a thread instead of a timer which to me would be optimalp  precode    Dim config As String     Dim configValues2 As String     Dim objReader As System.IO.StreamReader     Dim interval As Integer     Dim launchProcess As Process      While True         Beep          This sub runs every time the elapsed milliseconds of the timer pass          Sp add your code here.          config  30 cWiFiDropOutFixstart.vbs          Try             objReader  New System.IO.StreamReaderCWiFiDropOutFixconfig.txt             config  objReader.ReadToEnd             objReader.Close         Catch ex As Exception          End Try          configValues  config.SplitNew Char  c         interval  Convert.ToInt32configValues0          If Not interval gt 0 And Not interval lt 61 Then             interval  10         End If          launchProcess  Process.StartconfigValues1         launchProcess.WaitForExit          Thread.Sleepinterval  1000      End While End Sub codepre  pHere is my OnStart Code by Requestp  precodeProtected Overrides Sub OnStartByVal args As String      appLaunchLogicThread  New ThreadAddressOf appLaunchLogic     appLaunchLogicThread.Start  End Sub codepre  pTIA.p

Negative 4167 pI am sorry if this is a bit broad but Ive been working on a structure for a couple of days and I cant seem to figure this out the cleanest and most efficient way to do this. I could share the tables that Ive created for now but I really think its not close to how a proper diagram should be.p  pLet me describe my problem a bit I have Stores, Countries, Districts, Categories. Each store could belong to different CountriesDistricts enabling Store Branch manipulation. Of course a store could belong to multiple Categories too, for example Store X could be under both Food and Beverages and Night Clubs.  A Country will have multiple Districts and Stores, and a Store could have many Countries and Districts.p  pI am writing my application using C and I dont have problems creating datalayer objects and classes. But I need the proper MSSQL structure to manipulate and filter down data based on given criteria.p  pThe most important criteria would be Going through Countries as a first step, then locating Stores within that Country as a global view, then its important to sort Stores based on Districts andor Categories within that Country.p  pPlease let me know if you need me to share what I have for now, but since Im on Stack Overflow asking this question you can guess that Im doing this the wrong way.p  pAnyway, if you could shed some light on this issue and explain how things should be done properly I would highly appreciate it.p  pThanks in advance.p

Main is execution code, so would be stored in text. p  pIm not sure on the malloc part, is it just program code that would go in text also, or would it be on the stack as a function call p

Negative 4167 pThe idea is whether rain or shine, wet or fine, user must get that he paid for all out.p  pFrom Applep  pre Store Kit provides builtin functionality to restore transactions for nonconsumable products, autorenewable subscriptions and free subscriptions pre  pFor these transactions Apple Store Kit has good buildin tools. I want to focus on other types consumable in particular. One and only transaction information is an identifier and a receipt data which we receiving by Store Kit after successful purchase. Our application uses serverside model to deliver products to it. But there still much cases of losing purchase data, such as if the server lay down while user is making purchase via App Store so its not possible to send receipt to server to complete verification process.p  pCurrent workaround isp  ol liServer returns a list of product identifiersli liUser selects one app saves its identifier on device via SQLite or Core Data. Standart Apple Store transaction process goes right after that.li liIn case of success application saves receipt data in conjunction with its identifier on device and send it to server. If there were failure or cancelation the identifier is immediatelly removed from device.li liIf servers response is OK then app removes identifier with receipt data from device. Otherwise it will send requests to server periodically until successful response behaves.li ol  pBut this approach still has leaks. For example, user can remove application from device not waiting for transaction delivering to server, so there will not any proof about his purchase at all.p  pYour suggestionsp

Negative 4167 pIve developed a Silverlight application that needs to compress JPEG images on the client. Ive been using a library called a hrefhttpscode.google.compfjcore relnofollowFJCorea to achieve this goal.p  pOne of the biggest issues Im encountering, however, is the fact that this toolkit requires you to convert the JPEG to a WriteableBitmap first which strips off all the metadata associated with the JPEG such as EXIF, XMP, JFIF, etc. Ive modified the source of the FJCore library to persist the EXIF, compress the image, and then reattach the EXIF data. This process works but loses other types of metadata information. p  pInstead of having to implement a function that saves and writes each different type of metadata that exists for the JPEG format, I am looking for a simplified approach that will allow me to extract all metadata, regardless of type or format, use the FJCore toolkit to compressresize that image, and then reattach all the previously saved metadata. Some direction or sample code that could help me achieve my goal would be greatly appreciated. Remember, this is a Silverlight application, so those .NET libraries are what I have to work with.p  pThank you.p

Negative 4167 pI am trying to setup a system for writing continuous bytes of informationint using boosts managed shared memory.

Everything matches as planned. When two parallel processes A and B run, A always creates the managed shared memory object SHMtest and writes data using the Put function to B. This is done by allocating the required size to a particular offsetptr and doing a memcpy on it. B reads this data using the Get function and correspondingly returns the data from the specific offsetptr. p  pNow this works flawlessly as far as Ive seen when these functions are called by two regular separate processes. However when I run a threaded version of A that utilizes the Put function, it runs fine about 2930 times. Once in a way I got a segfault at Process B indicating a memcpy error. On further debugging of B I gotp  precodegdb print data[ID] 8  internal  moffset  18446744073690921056, alignmenthelper  data  buf  270343376377377377377,      align  ltNo data fieldsgt gdb print data[ID].get 9  0x7ffff346c3d0 ltAddress 0x7ffff346c3d0 out of boundsgt codepre  pThis indicated that the offsetptrs address was not in the processs legal range. To be satisfied, I  simultaneously debugged Process Ap  precodegdb print Packetgtdata[ID]  3  internal  moffset  18446744073690921056, alignmenthelper  data  buf  270343376377377377377, align  ltNo data fieldsgt gdb print Packetgtdata[ID].get 4  0x7ffff3c293d0  codepre  pWhere, Packet is an object of class PACKETINFO. This object is constructed as a named object in shared memory by Process A and found in shared memory by Process B. By looking at the output of GDB, the offsets are clearly matched... meaning it should work But I really cant figure out why in the case of threaded process A, this leads to out of bounds for the offsetptr of process B. p  pI know this is a very simplified version of the problem but I hope it is enough for a diagnosis or suggestion. p  pstrongEDITstrong Warning Since the thread of Process A runs the put function and returns successfully, I was not able to debug A at the point of the thread. As debug info is from the parent process.p

The output says Setting cardValue, and then the instance variable numbers are both right, but the other two are wrong.  The playerTotal reads whatever the total was before this card was dealt, and the playerCard3Value reads 0.  To give you some context, this function is called not when the first or second card is dealt, but when the third and on are.  The first two are not handled in a function.

I went though the local strategy example that uses an authToken, for login persistence, found on github. When speaking with a coworker, they posed the question, how is storing this token in a session cookie any more secure than storing a password because its essentially your authenticated identity on the server.  So how do i answer this question Its a green question, i admittedly dont fully understand the entire lifecycle. So how is this a safe solution when integrated with bccrypt and mongo like the example is. And if it was merely an example and not necessarily meant to show a robust solution, what are some best practices to keep our users and our application safep  pa hrefhttpsgithub.comjaredhansonpassportlocaltreemasterexamplesexpress3mongooserememberme relnofollowhttpsgithub.comjaredhansonpassportlocaltreemasterexamplesexpress3mongooseremembermeap

Negative 4167 pIm wondering what the mechanics behind the behaviour of the following code arep  precoderes.send 200,  data test data   console.log still here...  codepre  pMy understanding is that res.send doesnt return the function, but does close the connection  end the request. This could explain why I can still execute code after a res.send command I looked through the express source and it doesnt seem to be an asynchronous function. p  pIs there something else at play that I may be missingp  pThanks,p
Negative 4167 pRough idea of what I want to do  I have a class called Events that will hold a date object, some strings, and a few booleans. I create that using the data that is passed back when I call startActivityForResult in my DiaryMain.java. I want to take that Object and put it into an ArrayList called Diary. I am getting a codeNullPointer ExceptionDiaryMain.java111code, which is the line codediary.addnew Eventdate, lengthOfEvent, typeOfEvent, trigger, notes, ambcalled, ambneeded, awakecode in codeDiaryMain.onActivityResultcode. I have included relevant code for DiaryMain.java, DiaryEventCreate.java, and Event.java.

Negative 4167 pI am developing media player, which should be able to play audio from Internet. As Ive noticed, standard codeMediaPlayercode is quite unstable when playing remote content It is often falls or stops playback with no reason. On the other side, I want to implement media caching. But I havent found any way to get buffered content from codeMediaPlayercode to save it somewhere on device.p  pSo, Id like to implement buffering for myself and make codeMediaPlayercode play only local media. The first way I see is to download enough piece of media to a file, start playing this file via codeMediaPlayercode and continue downloading the rest of media with pausing when not enough media downloaded and processing other events like that. p  pThe question is it is possible to play file and append it in the same time Now I only have codeIllegalStateExceptionscode when calling codeMediaPlayercodes codesetDataSourcecodep  pstrongUPDstrongp  pcodeIllegalStateExceptioncode was caused by invalid logic. MediaPlayer is playing now. p  pBut the other issue appeared.p  pSo, first 5 of track is downloaded, MediaPlayer start playing, play these 5 and then stops.

Negative 4167 pFirst posted question, I have a little bit of Cake experience, but I am far from being proficient. In my Model  Product, I use the afterFind callback to do some calculations.  Firstly, it checks if the warranty of a product is still active startDate  warrantyperiod, then it calculates how much time is left on the warranty.  To do that, I use p  precodefuture  .results[key][Product][warrantyperiod].months     startDate  results[key][Product][created] endDate  dateYmd, strtotimefuture, strtotimestartDate curDate  dateYmd  ifendDate gt curDate date1  new DateTimeendDate date2  new DateTimecurDate interval  date1 gt diffdate2 codepre  pBy default, interval gets returned as a string of numbers, such as 01119. I then run through the following code to output it as such 0 years, 11 months, 19 days.p  precodeyears      ifintervalgty gt 0 years  intervalgty. years,   months         ifintervalgtm gt 0 months  intervalgtm. months,   days ifintervalgtd gt 0 days  intervalgtd. days  results[key][Product][warrantytime]  years.months.days else results[key][Product][warrantytime]  Expired  codepre  pThe results of these calculations are then passed in the results array returned from the afterFind. Here is my actual question How would I go about sorting the results array according to the warrantytime left p  pI use Paginator on some of my other fields, with echo thisPaginatorsortname, Name This works very nicely to sort the records ASC or DESC fairly quickly, but I cannot get it to work with my warrantytime field. I suspect that might be because cake sees the interval as a String, not an int or other numeric data type.p  pI thought seeing as though interval gets returned as a number, such as 01119 would it be possible to sort the array according to that and then do the formatting in the view What would be the best approach for doing thisp

Im assuming this is because the copy function is doing a deep copy, and when it starts to copy as reference of b, it goes into b and then wants to copy its reference of a, thus creating a circular copy, which will never end.p  pIs this assumption right  If so, is there a way to avoid this  Im assuming the answer will involve changing the way my data looks, but Im curious to hear another persons thoughts.p

Negative 4167 pIve searched to find an answer to my specific question but could not find one that matched. I understand that codereturn 0code and codereturn EXITSUCCESScode essentially do the same thing of saying that the program ended successfully, but what if you do codereturn 1code or codereturn 2code or any other int value for that matter Do different int values mean different things to the compiler or is returning any int simply mean that the program terminated successfully, in which case it doesnt matter what int value you put in To my limited knowledge, it seems that codeint maincode just needs to return any int in order to terminate.

The hotel aims to create a unique experience for guests  a place that is cosy, personal and homelike. The core design theme is about celebrating being singular  no two of the seventeen rooms are the same.nProject Requirements. Creation of a fun and innovative place that differentiates itself from other conventional hotels. Creation of a homelike and unique staying experience for hotel guests. Management of lighting and control of tropical sunlight throughout the property. Provision of distinct atmosphere during breakfast, lunch and dinner operations for inhouse contemporary restaurant  Lucas. Design for a Memorable Stay.nRenowned designer William Sawaya of Sawaya amp Moroni set the design tone of klapsons as contemporary luxury. Welcoming the guests upon arrival at the hotel is a unique stainless steel sphere that functions as the reception and checkin desk. The ceiling, like the sphere, is designed to harmonise and bring life to the entire lobby. Made up of three tiers of free form organic shapes, it invokes illuminating lights that flush the entire lobby in hues from the colour spectrum. Surrounding it is the hotel lobby that is equipped with a modern LED lighting system where the background tones can vary to match different moods at different hours of the day.  nThe same design flair is also found along the corridors leading to the guestrooms, in which profiles of light indicate the doors.  To obtain the largest possible number of rooms, the space of each room has limited width but extends considerably in depth. Whether its a choice of the standard rooms or the klapsons suite experience, the guests would expect a thoughtfully configured room with a unique setting. Redefining the notion of the bath, shellshaped and cylindricalstyled showers, even an opencube rain shower flanked with full length mirrors and colour changing LED lights have been incorporated for an unparalleled experience.nAll indirect lights are LEDpowered, giving off a sense of freshness during the day and a romantic ambience in the evening with alternation of colours and light intensity.  To achieve this effect without increasing operational and maintenance costs, the hotel has specified Qwreews QWER QWRQTefds Wwetwd System as the main lighting controller.  All changes of light settings at different times provide the option for wqtretqw staff to manually select the appropriate preset lighting scenes to suit their needs.nWhen guests at the hotel insert their key cards to enter the rooms, lights inside the guestroom will be automatically turned on to a daytime welcome mode  both the day and night curtains will open automatically and silently  soft lights will be switched on in the darker parts of the room.  Upon entering the rooms at night, a nighttime welcome mode will be turned automatically on. The night curtains will be drawn, the day curtains closed and a warm light activated. codepre  pstrongMXMLstrongp  precodeltsTextArea width400 height250 borderVisiblefalse     paragraphSpaceAfter15 paragraphSpaceBefore15 textAlignjustify     editablefalse selectabletrue fontSize16 texttxtgt codepre  pAnd I scroll text by mouse wheel to bottom, but scroll thumb doesnt reach to bottom.

Negative 4167 pI want some of window controls being highlighted somehow on each change generated internally by application to indicate user.p  pI found a nice method manipulate background color via palette and QVariantAnimation. The only widget which caused huge problem is QComboBox, because its background color requires a very tricky handling. The only platformindependent and proper way to change it is applying a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma133136761833765this hacka and setting backgroundcolor property of stylesheet. The problem is to get default value from stylesheet, required to smoothly set color back to initial state.p  pIs there are any way to handle this in uniwidget manner more specifically QAbstractButton, QLineEdit, QComboBox, QSlider, QListView, QGroupBox  Maybe there are alternative approaches to animate highlight of widgets p

Negative 4167 pIn order to increase performance of my JavaSpring web app deployed in Tomcat 7, I am trying to use MySQL read replicas for queries that Ive annotated as readonly okay. I have been using c3p0 for connection pooling prior to setting up an haxproxy server that will load balance requests to the read replicas and it works fine. I know that these two things kind of work against each other because each are trying to pool connections, however if I dont use connection pooling at the application layer, the high volume of queries opening new connections results in a very visible performance hit using Springs DriverManagerDataSource instead of c3p0s ComboPooledDataSource. p  pThe HAProxy setup works, however the timeout values set at 50s close connections that c3p0 thinks is open, so I have set the maxIdleTime on c3p0 at 40s as opposed to haproxys 50 to avoid haproxy closing connection before c3p0 can. This actually worked pretty well, but occasionally I still see an exception indicating that haproxy killed the connection before c3p0.p  precode204414,470 ERROR httpbio8080exec1 transaction.JDBCTransaction95  JDBC begin   failed com.mysql.jdbc.exceptions.jdbc4.CommunicationsException Communications link failure  The last packet successfully received from the server was 55,267 milliseconds ago.

Negative 4167 pI have a collection of C projects that use managed makefiles inside Eclipse.  I build them all, and run an existing deploy script to place all the compiled results into a target directory on the system.p  pId like a way to automate the build process without having to open the IDE, but due to external constraints from the project owner, I have to use managed make.p  pOnce I kickoff a build for the first time inside the Eclipse IDE, the Debug  Release directories are created, and the makefiles are autogenerated.  Once they are all present, I can call make from the command line, across all the projects, run an overall deploy script, etc.  This will work up until the point that code changes would cause the makefiles to differ addingremoving source files, or changing build parameters The big problem with this is that it requires me to open eclipse and manually cause the generation of the makefiles.p  pI see two optionsp  ol lipCheck the generated makefiles into revsion control even though theyre generated, I know, and commit them whenever they, after generation, have differed from the previous content.pli lipFind a way to either open eclipse in a scriptable way, and cause makefile generation, or to find some alternate way to generate the makefiles from the .project files.pli ol  pOption 1 is obviously subject to problems if I or other developers dont remember to commit the files, or if we update the Debug makefile but not the Release makefile, etc.  It also makes me feel dirty to commit a generated file.p  pOption 2 seems much better, if its feasible.p  pDoes a method to do option 2 exist  Are there other options I havent consideredp  pI recognize similarity with a continouous integration server, but This is not the same use case.

All errors go away when I cut out the setOnInsert portion of the command, but I need a way to make sure these values get set because they will be important in the queries I write to get the data back out.p  pBack to my main problem I did find that when I rearranged the order of the update and upsert documents when interacting with the MongoDB terminal, I got the error Im getting when I go through mgo, so I tried to very strictly control the order of the documents being passed in the mgo.Change struct by switching to bson.Dp  precode            change  bson.D                                       Update,                      bson.D                          setOnInsert, bson.D                                 id, id,                                 ci, r.Ci,                                 dt, r.Dt,                                 zi, r.Zi,                                 ,                          ,                          inc, ampdata,                      ,                 ,                                      Upsert,                     true,                 ,                          log.Printlnchange             err  collection.Updatebson.Did, id, ci, r.Ci, dt, r.Dt, zi, r.Zi,change if err  nil                  log.PrintlnFAILURE, err              codepre  pAt this point, printing the change object yields code[Update [setOnInsert [id 1163520131211 ci 3599 dt 20131211 zi 11635] inc 0xc21dd9d8d0] Upsert true]code which I believe to be exactly what I should be passing in as the change object in exactly the right order according to a hrefhttpdocs.mongodb.orgmanualreferencemethoddb.collection.update relnofollowMongos documentationa, but I still get the same codefull shard key must be in update object for collection db.collectioncode error.p  pI realize that using codecollection.Findid ... .Applychange, ...code is a possible alternative and it works properly when Ive used it, but in my testing on unsharded collections, Ive seen way higher performance as in 20x faster using the Upsert or Update functions and speed is absolutely a priority since Im dealing with tens of thousands of events per second. p  pIm getting to the point where I feel like Ive tried every think I can think of and would appreciate a fresh set of eyes trying to help me figure out what is happening, so any help would be appreciated.p

Negative 4167 pSorry if its not a question conforming to SO standards but I dont really know where else to ask for advice.

Negative 4167 pim reading the TCPIP Socket in Java, about the serversocket, it saysp  blockquote   pWhen we call accept on that ServerSocket   instance, if a new connection is pending, accept returns immediately otherwise it blocks   until either a connection comes in or the timer expires, whichever comes first. This allows   a single thread to handle multiple connections. Unfortunately, strongthe approach requires that   we constantly poll all sources of IOstrong, and that kind of busy waiting approach again introduces   a lot of overhead from cycling through connections just to find out that they have   nothing to do.p blockquote  pAs I understand it, should this be notified when a connection comes thus should not be busy waiting Did i misunderstand something...p  pemEDITemp  pThe whole paragraph is as belowp  blockquote   pBecause of these complications, some programmers prefer to stick with a singlethreaded   approach, in which the server has only one thread, which deals with all clientsnot sequentially,   but all at once. Such a server cannot afford to block on an IO operation with any   one client, and must use nonblocking IO exclusively. Recall that with nonblocking IO, we specify the maximum amount of time that a call to an IO method may block including zero.   We saw an example of this in Chapter 4, where we set a timeout on the accept operation   via the setSoTimeout method of ServerSocket. When we call accept on that ServerSocket   instance, if a new connection is pending, accept returns immediately otherwise it blocks   until either a connection comes in or the timer expires, whichever comes first. This allows   a single thread to handle multiple connections. Unfortunately, the approach requires that   we constantly poll all sources of IO, and that kind of busy waiting approach again introduces   a lot of overhead from cycling through connections just to find out that they have   nothing to dop blockquote

Negative 4167 pI tried to write a factorymethod to be able to control what the user gets as this doesnt work in the constructor. What it should do is that with a given object of, say type codeLcode the user should get an instance of a generic class parametrized with the type of the object given. But some cases are special so I would like to return a special object. I hope I can clearify this with the following examplep  precodepublic class FooltLgt      public FooL arg          whatever        public class BarltL extends Cgt extends FooltLgt      public BarL arg          superarg           public void someSpecialThing          do foo        public static class C     public static class D     public static ltL extends Cgt Bar fromCL arg      if arg  null         return null     return new BarltLgtarg   public static ltLgt FooltLgt genericL target      iftarget instanceof C          Now here is the problem we cannot safely cast BarltCgt          to BarltLgt because L may be super C.          And we cannot give target without cast as L because          L may not extend C.                   Of course giving L or C whichever is applicable          would work.... if only one could do that         return fromCC target     return new FooltLgttarget  codepre  pAs explained in the annotations one faces this problem p  pIt would be possible to create a codenew BarlttargetClassgtcode which could be safely cast down to codeFooltLgtcode because codeBarlttargetClassgtcode extends codeFoolttargetClassgtcode which extends codeFooltLgtcode. Now as you all know you have to hand over classnames to parametrized class, not Classobjects. p  pLets divide this into three casesp  pstrongcodeltObjectgtgenericnew Ccodestrong This would return a new instance of codeFooltObjectgtcode but it is supposed to behave like a codeBarltCgtcode. This could be achieved by codereturn FooltObjectgt new BarltCgtcode strongcodeltObjectgtgenericnew Dcodestrong This would also return a new instance of codeFooltObjectgtcode but it would behave like codeBarltDgtcode. Could be achieved by codereturn FooltObjectgt new BarltDgtcode strongcodeltCgtgenericnew Ccodestrong This would return a new instance of codeFooltCgtcode and is supposed to behave like codeBarltCgtcode. Could be done with codereturn FooltCgt new BarltCgtcodep  pI noticed that you can always emcastem to Foo but you cannot know which type to infer Bar with. This is either C if C is not super of L or L if so but I dont know how to tell the compiler.p  pSo the question is How can I make a factory that returns an instance of Bar if target is an instanceof C and else returns an instance of Foop

Negative 4167 pIm plannig to add swipe from edge  swipe from vertical border gesture functionality to my web application for touch based devices. Possibly I will use a hrefhttpeightmedia.github.iohammer.js relnofollowhammer.jsa like a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions24163202javascripttouchmovementtrackwhenuserswipesfromedgesthisa. But the problem is some browsers has swipe from edge functionality naturally.p  pFor example in Google Chrome for Androids a hrefhttpgooglesystem.blogspot.com.tr201308newgesturesinchromeforandroid.html relnofollowold versionsa, when you swipe from left edge, browser goes to next tab. Swipe from edge makes a hrefhttpwww.techinasia.comucbrowserupdatetabgesturesandroidtablets relnofollowUCBrowsera to go nextprevious page in current tab. Also a hrefhttpwww.mobilexweb.comblogsafariios7html5problemsapisreview relnofollowIOS 7a devices go previousnext page in history.p  pSo is it possible to detect whether swipe from edge functionality is activated in browser naturally  So I can disable the swipe feature for that type of browsers. Or should I check for user agent and disable for that browsers p  pI dont want to override browsers functionality. I want to disable my menus for that type of browsers.p

Negative 4167 pIm working in C WPF with a proprietary framework essentially a blend of Caliburn Micro and Castle Windsor and Ive got two singleton modules that have a race conditionp  pcodeDeviceServicecode  A service that manages a connection to a physical device emitting data. The service is Startable and hence is automatically constructed and initialized emasynchronouslyem.p  pcodeConnectionIndicatorViewModelcode  A client ViewModel that chiefly concerns itself with communicating to the user the status of the connection managed by codeDeviceServicecode. Changes state mainly based on events fired by codeDeviceServicecode.p  pMy problem lies at application startup. In the constructor for the ViewModel, I set the default state to Pending because I assume that the Service has not finished initializing. Then the ViewModel simply handles the Initialized event fired by the Service. Its in this handler that I asses the actual connection state via a property on the Service and update the ViewModel.p  pNow, all of this works just fine because it is extremely unlikely that the race condition poke its head in. However, in the unlikely case that the Service finishes its initialization before the ViewModel is constructed, it will never handle that Initialized event and will just stay in its Pending state.p  pIve considered changing the Service interface to return awaitable types for properties, so that any module trying to access properties will have to wait for initialization to finish, but Im not sure that this is the best approach. Im also wary of having part of the client kick off the Service because then who should initialize it if several modules use itp  pIs there some conventional way of dealing with this sort of asynchronous initialization that I am missingp

Negative 4167 pemHi guys Im having a bit of trouble creating a static library in xcode 5. Most of the tutorials out there are done in xcode 4 and thanks to apples incredibly easy to use gui, that makes it so easy for users to transition from one program to another, so I havent been able to make one and use it.  So I get that the first step is to make the cocoa ios static library project and then to add the header and implementation files .h and .m that you want in your library.  Next you supposed to set the header files that you want to be accessible by the user. Is it possible to set up the library in such a way that importing one header file also imports all of the other header files Do the other header files need to be public to do this My main problem is how do I actually set the classes which I want to be publicprivate and finally how do I implement this library into one of my applications A HelloWorldLibrary example would be greatemp  hr  pAfter using the link a hrefhttpgithub.comjverkoeyiOSFramework relnofollowgithub.comjverkoeyiOSFrameworkap  pI am now having a problem with the locating of the Frameworkp  precodeld warning directory not found for option LUsersHarryLibraryDeveloperXcodeDerivedDataSampleFrameworkefznryzmlxnimoaaazjfbqjirzxqBuildProductsDebugiphoneos ld framework not found SampleSubproject codepre  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comXZ6tF.png altenter image description herep

Negative 4167 pFirst off, Id like to state that I know very little about the imaging namepspaces in .Net. p  pI have two byte arrays of image data that I would like to merge into a bitmap for a WPF button.  I would like to do all of this in the C code is possible.  The background image is either a jpeg or png, and the overlay image is definitely a png with transparent areas.  The overlay image is one of a Sold Out banner that I would like to add to the original image.  I have a function that will convert either image to something the button.background will handle.p  pI have tried this for both images and it works just fine. The next part is the part due to my lack of familiarity of the image processing in .Net that has me stumped.  Ive seen something about a RenderTargetBitmap, but I havent been able to figure out how to get the basebackground bitmap into it to render the second one on top, maybe theres another way of doing this.  Heres a copy of the function that I have inherited from a previous coderproject.p  pI have to take the byte array and convert it over to something I can assign directly to the button.background p  precodepublic static BitmapImage ByteArrayToImageBrushthis byte[] imageData      if imageData  null  imageData.Length  0 return null     var image  new BitmapImage     using var mem  new MemoryStreamimageData              mem.Position  0         image.BeginInit         image.CreateOptions  BitmapCreateOptions.PreservePixelFormat         image.CacheOption  BitmapCacheOption.OnLoad         image.UriSource  null         image.StreamSource  mem         image.EndInit          image.Freeze     return image  codepre  pI have defined a new class that inherits from button call CategoryButton, that has some other misc. properties.  I can successfully place either image as the background for the button when I create the buttons in code with the followingp  precodeCategoryButton catbtn  new CategoryButton catbtn.Background  new ImageBrushByteArrayToImageBrushbgImageByteArray   or  catbtn.Background  new ImageBrushByteArrayToImageBrushoverlayImageByteArray codepre  pSo I know that function works well enough. But how does one get either the byte array or resultant ImageBrush into something that I can addmerge the second overlay image onto and then get that into a format that can be used for the button background I know that this is a lot of question, but Im stumped and I and getting frustrated in trying to figure it outp

This is going to be millions of records joined to a table with about 10 records in it, so I didnt want to go the COALESCE route as I have seen performance degradation there in the past in using functions in joins.

About a month now Im learning C, and since I got over friends, inheritance and stuff, I got a few questions, since I havent been working with it up until nowp  pIs there a way for a class to define friends later on, because they need to exchange information or something. e.g. is there a way to define a random friend later on what do you need for that The functions name or the address of the class p  pOr is there generally a way to change the code from the program itself, so that it wont be necessary to recompile e.g. creating new functions, classes or sop  pId be very happy about any answer about that.p

Negative 4167 pIm having real problems with my apps under iOS8. Ive made a bunch of OpenGL based apps, which dont need the iOS to handle the orientation. Its all handled within the OpenGL section. But I do use setStatusBarOrientation to make sure any dialogskeyboards etc that pop up line up with everything else. Im creating my window and view programatically or in a xib, Ive never needed to use a storyboard in case thats relevantp  pIts all been perfect, til iOS 8 came along.p  pNow it seems that setStatusBarOrientation isnt behaving properly at all. Its either not changing anything, or its rotating something that stops touches being recorded on half the screen. Its as if the window is being rotated within itself, but visually nothing changes, just the touches are effected.p  pIts hard to explain, and makes no sense.p  pBut my question is How do you set the status bar orientation in iOS8 And how do you do it without destroying everything else that works in previous iOS versionsp

Suppose I have the following situationp  precodevar AppRouterController     Route to the homepage   home function      Unload the existing route, and load this one instead   ,   Route to a user profile page   user function      Unload the existing route, and load this one instead   ,   Route to a list of tasks or something   tasks function      Unload the existing route, and load this one instead   ,   var TheRouter  new Marionette.AppRouter   controller new AppRouterController,   appRoutes      home home,     userid user,     tasksdate tasks     codepre  pI would like for my app to load each new route dynamically, and completely remove its predecessor from the DOM probably via an animation where, at least for a little bit, they will share screen space.  I can see my app having two regions the navbar, and the content the area where the information from a given route is renderedp  precodelthtmlgt   ltbodygt     ltsection regionnavbargtltsectiongt     ltsection regioncontent idhomeusertaskswhateverRoutegtltsectiongt   ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pSo, my DOM body would always have two children the navbar region section, and the content region section for whatever the current active route in Marionette is.  What would be the best way to manage this process in Marionette  By that I mean, only grabbing the modules in a particular route when they are needed rather than grabbing them all on load, creating a new content region, and replacing the existing content region in a smooth manner.p

Negative 4167 pI integrated Parse.com Push into my Android app using the Parse SDK 1.7.0 for Android. I followed the instructions in the Quickstart on Parse.com a hrefhttpswww.parse.comappsquickstartparsepushandroidexisting relnofollowhttpswww.parse.comappsquickstartparsepushandroidexistinga.p  pFirst my app crashed upon receiving a push notification. Logcat indicated a nullpointexception error associated with the notification icon. The Parse documentation a hrefhttpsparse.comdocspushguidereceivingAndroid relnofollowhttpsparse.comdocspushguidereceivingAndroida indicates that by default, the applications launcher icon is used for a notification. This somehow did not work. This crash was fixed after adding the following tag to the AndroidManifest, to customize the notification icon codeltmetadata androidnamecom.parse.push.notificationicon androidresourcedrawablepushicongtcode.p  pNotifications are now received succesfully, but no ticker text is shown in the status bar of the Android device. The screenshots on the Parse.com website, which show a preview of the push notification to be sent, do show this ticker tekst, so it is supposed to be shown. Upon receiving the push message, the text of the notification that is shown in the notification tray should also be shown in the status bar for a few seconds, when the notification icon appears. In my case, only the notification icon appears. The notification text is only visible in the notification tray.p  pAm I the only one experiencing this behaviour Is this perhaps a bug in the recently released Parse SDK 1.7.0 for Androidp

Negative 4167 pI parse XML text read from embedded resource using XmlDocument.Load. There are text elements containing multiple lines. I have read that XML parser is supposed to normalize line breaks turning CRLF pairs into single LF characters. But I found that it does not in some cases. More weird is that sometimes it does normalization and I cannot figure out what this behavior depends on. We have some unit tests depending on this behavior and they pass on some machines and fail on other ones and different programs on the same machine behave differently. What I am missingp  pHere is a simple test program which in my case always shows that both CR and LF are preserved literally. But the unit test I mentioned passes on the same machine indicating that line feeds are normalized.

Negative 4167 pIm creating an MVC 5 site with Web API 2 functionality inside it as well and Im wondering how I should work with the fact that ASP.NET uses 2 different resolver instances for resolving MVC controllers and ApiControllers.  p  pI found a hrefhttpwww.devtrends.co.ukblogusingunity.mvc5andunity.webapitogetherinaproject relnofollowthis articlea that explains how to configure the resolution, but it looks like it uses 2 separate container instances and doesnt explain how to register dependencies for each. Its just like do your registration here.p  pFollowing the 2container example, I was tempted to set up the app so that the Web API container only has Web API dependencies and the MVC container only has mvc controller dependencies, but I feel like in the situation where a component is used for both, having a subset of items used in both containers would be too much work to maintain correctly.p  pIs it okay to just have all of the dependencies installed in each container Or is it better to use the same container in each resolverp  pEdit Im not using Unity so Im writing a resolver class to wrap Windsor. Im considering having my resolver implement both interfaces and just assigning the same instance as the different resolvers as well.p

Negative 4167 pI have developed a wrapper class on Log4j2. Using declarative services of OSGi I have published a custom logger service using my own logger interface with the wrapper class being the implementation. The wrapper class is only used to configure the logger programmatically, message formatting amp add a few more methods, at last it is calling the logging methods of Log4j2. p  pI want to print source classfile name and line number of each logs requested in the log file. The options CF and L only print information about the location inside my wrapper class where I actually call the emlogem method. p  pSo as a workout I am passing emnew Throwableem as an argument each time so that I can use the layout emthrowableshort.lineNumberem. But this is an expensive process for embedded applications. p  pMy main problem is in getting the line number because for the file name I could at least request a new logger from Log4j2 with the name of each service requesting for logger service and keep it in a map. p  pIs there a solution to trace back the caller I hope there is a similar solution for applications where you dont want to have the LOG4j2 jars on each consumer of the logger service. Just for info, I dont want to use any XML files, all configurations are made programmatically. p

However, after accessing the application and performing few operations for capturing the coverage, Tried stopping the server the jboss shutdown hook would call the required cobertura class and generate the cobertura.ser file which is used to create the coverage report and this results in the below exceptionp  precode20150209 174606,420 SEVERE [net.sourceforge.cobertura.coveragedata.TouchCollector] Thread84 Cannot apply touches java.lang.NoSuchMethodException com.sample.package.SomeInstrumentedClass.coberturaclassmapnet.sourceforge.cobertura.coveragedata.LightClassmapListener at java.lang.Class.getDeclaredMethodClass.java1994 [rt.jar1.7.025] at net.sourceforge.cobertura.coveragedata.TouchCollector.applyTouchesToSingleClassOnProjectDataTouchCollector.java125 [adminrestapi1.0.0.jar1.0.0] at net.sourceforge.cobertura.coveragedata.TouchCollector.applyTouchesOnProjectDataTouchCollector.java107 [adminrestapi1.0.0.jar1.0.0] at net.sourceforge.cobertura.coveragedata.ProjectData.saveGlobalProjectDataProjectData.java270 [adminrestapi1.0.0.jar1.0.0] at net.sourceforge.cobertura.coveragedata.SaveTimer.runSaveTimer.java32 [adminrestapi1.0.0.jar1.0.0] at java.lang.Thread.runThread.java724 [rt.jar1.7.025] codepre  pThis exception is thrown for all the classes cobertura is trying to access.

Negative 4167 pI have a recyclerView of items that, among others, contains a timeStamp of a duration of a game retrieved from a WS. To show the duration of the match, i have to get the current timeStamp, do the mat and convert it to a readable format for eg 5 minutes 5s. Only some of the views need to be updated.p  pEach childview needs to be updated every xxx seconds. p  ul lipMy first aproach was create a list of Objects binded to the view that needed to be updated. On my fragment i would declare a Handler and call notifyItemChangedposition for every object in the list. Each time the handler calls notifyItemChanged, the whole view is rerendered, and theres a small blink effect. I dont want it to happen, so my second approach was to only change the TextView of every childView that needed to be updated.

In a lot of cases I get the attributes from the API so I can do number 2 even without the validation. However, sometimes a user will create a firewall rule, attach it to a server and send it to an API POST with JSON body.p  pIs there some standardpythonic way to handle objects with a large amount of attributes Does the approach in 2 seem good or should I really go with the verbose 1 wayp  pEDIT one concrete example is a firewall rule object that has the following parametersp  precode    action     destinationaddressend     destinationaddressstart     destinationportend     destinationportstart     direction     family     icmptype     position     protocol     sourceaddressend     sourceaddressstart     sourceportend     sourceportstart codepre  pRight now Im leaning towards something likep  precodeclass FirewallRuleobject      attributes           action defaultvalue,         destinationaddressend defaultvalue,         destinationaddressstart defaultvalue,                 destinationportend defaultvalue,         destinationportstart defaultvalue,         direction defaultvalue,         family defaultvalue,         icmptype defaultvalue,         position defaultvalue,         protocol defaultvalue,         sourceaddressend defaultvalue,         sourceaddressstart defaultvalue,         sourceportend defaultvalue,         sourceportstart defaultvalue           def initself, kwargs          for key in kwargs             valurordefault  kwargs.getkey, attributes[key]             setattrself, key, valurordefault codepre  pIn production code Id obviously add better error handling and validationp

Negative 4167 pI have a loop in my view that goes through each employee in the an employee table. During this loop, a premium in a dollar amount is generated for each employee and is displayed in the view, but not stored in the database. Each of the employees has a familyid, which is stored in the employees table. What I want to do is sum the dollar amounts of all common familyids. p  blockquote   pFor example If there are three employees, employeea, employeeb, and   employeec, where employees a and b belong to a common familyid and   employeec belongs to a separate familyid. Their premiums are as   follows employeea familyid  1 premium 300, employeeb   familyid  1 premium 550, and employeec familyid  2 premium   450. This should result in a total familyid1 premium of 850 and a   total familyid2 premium of 450.p blockquote  pHow would I go about summing similar familyid premiums without storing the employee premiums in a databasep  pMy initial thought was to store the premiums in a hash with key values of familyid and value pairs made up of arrays of premiums. If we referred to the example, above, we would have a hash   1  [300, 550], 2  [450] . Then I figured I would iterate through the hash and pull the sum of each of the arrays as my total family premiums. However, I am having difficulty figuring out the proper syntax to execute this plan. p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated  I am new to RubyRails so bear with me here if there is something fatally wrong with my strategy.p

Negative 4167 pIm looking for a Java library that can readwrite a list of simple objects fromto a CSV file.p  pLets define a simple object as a POJO that all its fields are primitive typesstrings.p  pThe matching between an objects field and a CSV column must be defined according to the strongname of the fieldstrong and the strongtitlestrong first row of the column  strongthe two must be identicalstrong. No additional matching information should be required by the library  Such additional matching information is a horrible code duplication with respect to the definition of the POJO class if you simply want the CSV titles to match the field names.p  pThis last feature is something Ive failed to find in all the libraries I looked at OpenCSV, Super CSV and BeanIO.p  pThanksp  pOferp

Negative 4167 pI am developing H264 HW accelerated video decoder for android.

After a bit research, Ive found that  p  ol lipI found a a hrefhttpsvec.iopostsuseandroidhardwaredecoderwithomxcodecinndk relnofollowgreat resourcea of using stagefright with FFmpeg, but I can not use FFmpeg as for its license, it is quite restrictive for distributed software. Or possible to discard FFmpeg from this approachpli lipI can not use MediaCodec as its a Java API and I have to call it via the JNI from C layer which is relatively slow and I am not allowed.pli lipI can not use OpenMax AL as it only supports the decoding of MPEG2 transport stream via a buffer queue. This rules out passing raw h264 NALUs or other media formats for that matter.pli lipNow only left are  stagefright and OpenMax IL. I came to know that stagefright uses OpenMaxOMX interface. So should I go with stagefright or OpenMax IL Which will be more promisingpli ol  pAlso, I came to know that Android HW accelerated decoder is vendor specific and every vendors has their own OMX interfacing APIs. Is it true If so, do I need to write HW vendor specific implementation incase of OpenMax IL What about stagefright  Is it hardware agnostic or hardware dependent If there is no way of HW indenpent implementation using stagefright or OpenMax IL, I need to support at least Qualcomms Snapdragon, Samsungs Exynos and Tegra4.p  pNote that, I need to decode H264 Annex B stream and expect decoded data after decode which I will send to my video rendering pipeline.

Negative 4167 pWhat is the best way to ingest a log file into HDFS while it is being written  I am trying to configure Apache Flume, and am trying to configure sources that can offer me data reliability as well. I was trying to configure exec and later also looked at spooldir but the following documentation at flume.apache.org has put doubt on my own intent p  pstrongExec Sourcestrongp  blockquote   pOne of the most commonly requested features is the use case like   strongtail F filenamestrong where an application writes to a log file on disk and   Flume tails the file, sending each line as an event. While this is   possible, theres an obvious problem what happens if the channel   fills up and Flume cant send an event Flume has no way of indicating   to the application writing the log file, that it needs to retain the   log or that the event hasnt been sent for some reason. Your   application can never guarantee data has been received when using a   unidirectional asynchronous interface such as ExecSourcep blockquote  pstrongSpooling Directory Sourcestrongp  blockquote   pUnlike the Exec source, spooldir source is reliable and will not   miss data, even if Flume is restarted or killed. In exchange for this   reliability, only immutable files must be dropped into the spooling   directory. If a file is written to after being placed into the   spooling directory, Flume will print an error to its log file and stop   processing.p blockquote  pAnything better is available that I can use to ensure Flume will not miss any event and also reads in realtime p
Negative 4167 pIm working with an HTML input of type codetextcode. Im manually getting and setting the cursor of the input programmatically in JS using the a hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenUSdocsWebAPISelection relnofollowSelection APIa.p  pWhen the cursor is set to a particular position like this, the scroll for the input isnt automatically focused on the cursors location. To force the scroll to focus, the inputs codescrollLeftcode has to be manually calculated and set where the cursors location would be. This is where the problem arises.p  pThe cursors position is set by the index of the character in the inputs string of text. If there are 40 characters in the string, setting the cursor to position 40 would set it to the end of the string. Unfortunately, codescrollLeftcode is set using the width of each character, in pixels. Since all characters arent the same width this presents a problem. This means, to manually set the focus of the input element to the position of the cursor, you must calculate the width of each character between the start of the string and the cursors position index.p  pThe easiest way Ive thought of to accomplish this is to create a second input thats used to measure the width of each character in the string individually. Since theres no way to automatically get the width of any given character, the codescrollWidthcode of this second input would equal the width of that single character. For my use case, the cursor will only ever change position one index at a time. This means I can increment or decrement the codescrollLeftcode the width of each character one at a time.p  pBecause this is would be super complicated, Im wondering if anyone has come across something simple that will accomplish my goal. Something likep  precodeinputEL.scrollLeft  auto codepre  pNote Manually setting the cursor in the input and then calling codefocuscode on that input doesnt work. But something like that would be ideal.p
