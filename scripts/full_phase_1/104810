Positive 104810 pSo, in my app, I utilize Background Fetch. I also use the Keychain with this for authenticating sessions and requesting data from my backend.p  pIt seems as though Background Fetch is never called when the phone is locked. Is this the casep  pFurther, I was under the impression that when using Keychain, that whenever my app is in the background, Id be able to access values stored there as long as I use code.AccessibleAfterFirstUnlockcode.p  pIm using that, but whenever the phone is locked and I Simulate Background Fetch via Xcode, my values I get back from the Keychain are codenilcode.p  pIs this expected I havent found any answers about these situations exactly. It seems like when the phone is unlocked that I successfully get values from the Keychain every time.p
Positive 104810 pWe have a simple game that has a main codeGameScenecode of codeSKScenecode type. The codeGameScenecode creates a model object called codeGameEngineModelcode.  p  pIt also stores a reference as delegate for communication. For example, if the score is changed in the codeGameEngineModelcode it calls a delegate method on the Scene to update the HUD.  p  pI would like all the game logic, including creation of sprites on the screen to be completed in the codeGameEngineModelcode. Previously we called this method to spawn some sprites on the screen.  p  precodefunc spawnGameIconsLoop       Run the main actions on loop     runActionSKAction.repeatActionForever         SKAction.sequence[             SKAction.runBlockaddCircleIcon,             SKAction.waitForDurationspawnRate             ]           codepre  pWe would like to move this logic to the codeGameEngineModelcode, the issue is that this is of no class so runAction is not available here.   p  pHow could we control the game logic outside of the scene here.

Positive 104810 pIve recently updated Xcode to 7 so I could start developing against iOS 9.  Upon first launching my application, I noticed that the screen sizescale is off compared to how it looks on iOS 8, both on the iPhone 6 device.p  pHere is how it looks correct on iOS 8p  pa hrefhttpi.imgur.comCP6PWTA.png relnofollowhttpi.imgur.comCP6PWTA.pngap  pHere is how it looks incorrect on iOS 9p  pa hrefhttpi.imgur.comzDj1MQb.png relnofollowhttpi.imgur.comzDj1MQb.pngap  pIf you also notice, both of those images are the same exact size.p  pNote how the AdMob banner has white space on the leftright, Im assuming AdMob just knows to center it.  Also the big white space to the right of the table view and the button down on the bottom.p  pAlso, when in iOS 8, and putting a break point in the main delegate method, the main window has a frame of 0 0 320 568.  The layer on the window is also the same.p  pOn the flip side, when in iOS 9, and putting a break point in the main delegate method, the main window has a frame of 0 0 375 667.  The layer on the window is also the same.p  pThat explains why the difference in the look of the app in iOS 8 vs. iOS 9, but I do not know why iOS 8 looks the way I want it to and iOS 9 doesnt.  Is there some setting that Im missingp  pEDITp  pIve also since figured out that the bounds of the mainScreen is different between when this runs in iOS 8 vs. iOS 9.  The screenBounds of the mainScreen is set to the same frame as up above, and I have no clue why it is different between the two iOS versions.p  pEDIT 2p  pSo I just created a brand new project and tested this out.  I do not get the same behavior as explained up above in my first edit.  When I view the mainScreen bounds, in both iOS 8 and iOS 9, it is 0,0375,667p  pI just cannot figure out what is causing this to happen so I can fix it.p  pEDIT 3p  pAfter toying around quite a bit last night, it turns out that the launch images are causing this to happen.  If I remove the launch images of Default5682x.png from the list, then it displays properly.  Very odd that something like this can effect the scale.  I still didnt figure out how to solve this yet though because you have to have launch images or apple will reject the app, so Im keeping this open until I have more time tonight to toy around with it.p

Positive 104810 pIn a UITextView with the editing disabled I try to select a string like hash with a long press in that string, but it is only selected hash without the  prefix. p  pIs there a way to select all the string hashtag pattern with a long press. p  pThanks in advance.p
Positive 104810 pIn my app, I use UIKit Dynamics including a UICollisionBehavior to have a menu bounce when it opens and when it closes. The code Im using for this is below. This has been working fine for iOS8. With iOS9 including iOS9.1 beta 2 just released, however, Im finding an odd issue. On the surface, the menu Im bouncing with this bouncing animation wasnt full closing after opening and then closing it. Looking more closely, I find that the boundaries for the UICollisionBehavior are computed with the same values across iOS8 and iOS9.p  pMenu opening collision boundary code798,330 to 1024,330code Which represents a line, on screen, where the bottom of the menu should finally rest after opening and bouncing.p  pMenu closing collision boundary code798,280 to 1024,280code Which represents a line, off screen, where the top of the menu should finally rest after closing and bouncing.p  pThe problem comes in iOS9 where the menu UIView doesnt actually end up resting finally at these boundaries. After opening, the menu frame looks like this with iOS9p  pcode798, 1.5 226, 330code [This is x, y w, h]p  pand after closing, the menu frame looks likep  pcode798, 278.5 226, 330codep  pstrongBUTstrong, this should actually bep  pcode798, 0 226, 330code after openingp  pcode798, 280 226, 330code after closingp  pstrongAnyone else seeing these issues with iOS9 and collision behaviorsstrong p  pIm about to put a hack in my code search for HACK below, which Ill make selective for iOS9, but  I really dont like these hacksp  pBounceAnimation.hp  precode   BounceAnimation.h   Petunia    Created by Christopher Prince on 121814.

Positive 104810 pIve an application using an adaptive codeUISplitControllercode. So it behaves as codeUISplitViewControllercode for horizontal regular sizes and as a codeUINavigationControllercode for horizontal compact sizes.p  pThe content of the master is a codeUINavigationControllercode. Its root is a codeUITableViewControllercode. When pressing one of the rows I push in the master a codeDocumentDetailViewControllercode and, depending on the content I present a specific codeUIViewControllercode in the detail codeshowDetailViewController sendercode.p  pMy problem is the following once I press the back button in the codeDocumentDetailViewControllercode, I want to reset the content of the right panel, that is the default controller I show when nothing is selected in the table. But, if i do this by calling codeshowDetailViewController sendercode the result is ok for regular size, but wrong for the compact. In this last case, I dont want to do nothing, just want to see the table.p  pI still havent found a clean solution for that.p

Negative 104810 pWhat I am trying to achieve is a form that has a button on it that causes the Form to dropdown and become larger, displaying more information.

Note that the width values are supposed to be able to go from 1 to int.MaxValue Well, in practice, they go from this.Width to int.MaxValue, ie. you can make the form larger, but never smaller again.

Anyone have any ideasp  pFor the record Ive also tried a Form.Resize handler that set the Height of the form to the same value depending on whatever the boolean expanded was set to, but I ended up with the same side effect.p  pPS Im using .NET 3.5 in Visual Studio 2008. Other solutions are welcome, but this was my thoughts on how it should be done and how I attempted to do it.p  pEdit Seems the code works, as per the accepted answers response. If anyone else has troubles with this particular problem, check the AutoSize property of your form, it should be FALSE, not TRUE. This is the default, but Id switched it on as I was using the form and a label with autosize also on for displaying debugging info earlierp

Negative 104810 pI have a WCF Service that exposes a method GetCustomers. The internals of the method uses a Data Layer along with a Business Layer to return a List of Customers. Currently I am using an SQL Server Database file saved on the server. Everything works fine on my local network but I want to move this to the web.p  pI thought the best method would be to create an IIS WCF Service which makes calls to the current WCF Services GetCustomers. I havent had much experience with the SQL Server Database Files but I figured I would need to move the .mdf file to the IIS WCF Service AppData folder but Im not sure how to change the database connectionstring and get all this to work properly. The only thing I can figure is that I will have to reimplement the GetCustomers method in the IIS WCF Service and point it to the correct database. It seems like I shouldnt have to do this though.p  pI know that if I where hosting the DB in a full SQL Server implementation that this wouldnt be a problem because the connectionstring wouldnt change. That is not an option at this point.p  pI think I am making this more difficult than it should be. p
Negative 104810 pWe have a SQL Server 2005 database, and currently all our users are connecting to the database via the TCPIP protocol. p  pThe SQL Server Configuration Manager allows you to enable both Named Pipes, and TCPIP connections at the same time. Is this a good idea My question is not whether we should use named pipes instead of TCPIP, but are there problems associated with enabling bothp  pOne of our clients IT guys, says that enabling database communication with both protocols will limit the bandwidth that either protocol can use  to like 50 of the total. I would think that the bandwidth that TCPIP could use would be directly tied inversely to the amount of traffic that Named Pipes or any of the other types of traffic were occupying on the network at that moment. However, this IT person is indicating that the fact that we have enabled two protocols on the server, artificially limits the bandwidth that TCPIP can use. Is this correctp  pI did Google searches but could not come up with an answer to this question. Any help would be appreciated.p
Negative 104810 pI had a straight forward approach of turning KeyValue pairs of an XML excerpt into an NSDictionary when I started a simple iPhone application. The problem is, I need to turn those NSDictionarys instances that once populated my UITableViews into custom classes because they require behavior and additional complexity. The problem here is that now in order for me to instantiate an object and fill its instance variables with keyvalue pairs from a web service becomes that much more difficult. I can no longer throw it into a method that iterates through the XML and uses KVC to set its instance variables. p  pWhat kind of other solution is out therep
Negative 104810 pI recently read a hrefhttpblog.astrumfutura.comarchives373TheMinMVCWhyModelsareMisunderstoodandUnappreciated.html relnofollowthis posta which led to a series of other posts that all seem to suggest the same idea Models do everything, the View should be able to communicate directly with the model and vice versa all while the Controller stays out of the way. However, all of the examples shown are fairly simplistic and none really show an example of how anyone has tried to implement full handling of of a request  response cycle, which got me to wondering should the model be responsible for handling the request ie GET, POST, etc itself and should the controller only operate as a passthrough to instantiate the necessary models and pass the models to the view. In fact I found one example taken the extreme of embedding a ZendForm object in the modelp  pFrom my reading of what Fowler says about MVC and just controllers in general it seems at first glance that the thinner the controller layer the better. But then I took the time to back through and study what he says about both MVC and Front Controller which just muddies the waters because both patterns define controllers and now my instincts suggest that ZendFramework in implementing both of these patterns, has actually created a composite object that performs the functions of a Controller in MVC and those of a Command object in Front Controller or some such.p  pSo Im wondering what the general opinions would be of others who have implemented similar patterns in their apps  do you handle the request entirely within the controller layer or do you make the model aware of the request and handle parameters directly within the model p

My issue with this point is that there is nothing inherent in properties that actually enforces this it is simply how they are strongsupposedstrong to be used. To me, this is analogous to a shouldBePrivate qualifier that indicates a value emshouldem be accessed directly only by its own class, but which can still be accessed externally anyway or a police force that patrols the streets to remind us that we emshouldem behave ourselves, but does not actually interfere when we start committing crimes if it isnt enforced, what is it really doing for us.p  pId be more impressed by this point if properties had some sort of builtin mechanism for ensuring readwrite cheapness.p

Negative 104810 pIm looking for pointers and information here, Ill make this CW since I suspect it has no single one correct answer. This is for C, hence Ill make some references to Linq below. I also apologize for the long post. Let me summarize the question here, and then the full question follows.p  pSummary In a UIBLLDALDB 4layered application, how can changes to the user interface, to show more columns say in a grid, avoid leaking through the business logic layer and into the data access layer, to get hold of the data to display assuming its already in the database.p  phr p  pLets assume a layered application with 34 layersp  ul liUser Interface UIli liBusiness Logic Layer BLLli liData Access Layer DALli liDatabase DB the 4th layerli ul  pIn this case, the DAL is responsible for constructing SQL statements and executing them against the database, returning data.p  pIs the only way to correctly construct such a layer to just always do select  To me thats a big nono, but let me explain why Im wondering.p  pLets say that I want, for my UI, to display all employees that have an active employment record. By active I mean that the employment records fromto dates contains today or perhaps even a date I can set in the user interface.p  pIn this case, lets say I want to send out an email to all of those people, so I have some code in the BLL that ensures I havent already sent out email to the same people already, etc.p  pFor the BLL, it needs minimal amounts of data. Perhaps it calls up the data access layer to get that list of active employees, and then a call to get a list of the emails it has sent out. Then it joins on those and constructs a new list. Perhaps this could be done with the help of the data access layer, this is not important.p  pWhats important is that for the business layer, theres really not much data it needs. Perhaps it just needs the unique identifier for each employee, for both lists, to match upon, and then say These are the unique identifiers of those that are active, that you havent already sent out an email to. Do I then construct DAL code that constructs SQL statements that only retrieve what the business layer needs Ie. just SELECT id FROM employees WHERE ...p  pWhat do I do then for the user interface For the user, it would perhaps be best to include a lot more information, depending on emwhyem I want to send out emails. For instance, I might want to include some rudimentary contact information, or the department they work for, or their managers name, etc., not to say that I at least name and email address information to show.p  pHow does the UI get that data Do I change the DAL to make sure I return enough data back to the UI Do I change the BLL to make sure that it returns enough data for the UI If the object or data structures returned from the DAL back to the BLL can be sent to the UI as well, perhaps the BLL doesnt need much of a change, but then requirements of the UI impacts a layer beyond what it should communicate with. And if the two worlds operate on different data structures, changes would probably have to be done to both.p  pAnd what then when the UI is changed, to help the user even further, by adding more columns, how deep wouldshould I have to go in order to change the UI assuming the data is present in the database already so no change is needed there.p  pOne suggestion that has come up is to use LinqToSQL and IQueryable, so that if the DAL, which deals with what as in what types of data and why as in WHEREclauses returned IQueryables, the BLL could potentially return those up to the UI, which could then construct a Linqquery that would retrieve the data it needs. The user interface code could then pull in the columns it needs. This would work since with IQuerables, the UI would end up actually executing the query, and it could then use select new  X, Y, Z  to specify what it needs, and even join in other tables, if necessary.p  pThis looks messy to me. That the UI executes the SQL code itself, even though it has been hidden behind a Linq frontend.p  pBut, for this to happen, the BLL or the DAL should not be allowed to close the database connections, and in an IoC type of world, the DALservice might get disposed of a bit sooner than the UI code would like, so that Linq query might just end up with the exception Cannot access a disposed object.p  pSo Im looking for pointers. How far off are we How are you dealing with this I consider the fact that changes to the UI will leak through the BLL and into the DAL a very bad solution, but right now it doesnt look like we can do better.p  pPlease tell me how stupid we are and prove me wrongp  pAnd note that this is a legacy system. Changing the database schema isnt in the scope for years yet, so a solution to use ORM objects that would essentially do the equivalent of select  isnt really an option. We have some large tables that wed like to avoid pulling up through the entire list of layers.p

For this reason, we would like to limit the concurrent requests to this server say for example we would only want 10 requests processed in parallel. We would want other requests  wait in the queue.p  pCan a custom thread pool be created, and configured to define max number of threads and assign for this servlet to handle this scenario We are using WebLogic server 9.2. Or is there any other better approach to do this Appreciate any thoughts.p  pCould we configure a separate servlet and configure the thread pool to only allow X number of concurrent requests, all other requests would be placed in queue to use the next available servlet.

Negative 104810 pI have a ASP.NET website in which a user makes a request. Every request kicks off a long process that may take several minutes worst case of 20 mins. At the end of the request a file is created for the user to download.p  pCurrently, I have this request kick off the process asynchronously using Async pages but I am getting time out errors. I suspect my approach is flawed. To make this process scalable, my next guess is to have a windows service that executes the long running process. When a user makes a request, I add the request details in a database table. The Win Service picks it up and processes it. In the meantime, the user is redirected to a page that asks them to wait while the file is being created.p  pWould this be the ideal approach If so, do I have to refresh the page every x minutes to check if the windows service has completed the processingp

Negative 104810 pGiven a finite number of items which differ in kind, is it better to represent them with stacked enums and enum constructors, or to subclass them Or is there a better approach altogetherp  pTo give you some context, in my small RPG program which ironically is supposed to be simple, a character has different kinds of items in his or her inventory. Items differ based on their type and use and effect. p  pFor example, one item of inventory is a spell scroll called Gremlin that adjusts the Utility attribute. Another item might be a sword called Mort that is used in combat and inflicts damage. p  pIn my RPG code, I now have tried two ways of representing inventory items. One way was subclassing for example, InventoryItem  Spell  AdjustingAttributes InventoryItem  Weapon  Sword and instantiating each subclass when needed, and assigning values such as names like Gremlin and Mort. p  pThe other way was by stacking enums and enum constructors. For example, I created enums for itemCategory and itemSpellTypes and itemWeaponTypes, and the InventoryItem enum was like thisp  precodepublic enum InventoryItem     GREMLINitemType.SPELL, itemSpellTypes.ATTRIBUTE, Attribute.UTILITY,    MORTitemType.WEAPON, itemWeaponTypes.SWORD, 30     InventoryItemitemType typeOfItem, itemSpellTypes spellType, Attribute attAdjusted      snip, enum logic here        InventoryItemitemType typeOfItem, itemWeaponTypes weaponType, int dmg      snip, enum logic here          and so on, for all the permutations of items.    codepre  pIs there a better Java programming practice than these two approaches Or if these are the only ways, which of the two is better Thanks in advance for your suggestions.p

Negative 104810 pI try to grok that Apple is talking about packets in audio files, and there is a fancy function called AudioFileReadPackets which takes a lot of arguments. One of them specifies the start packet, and another one the number of packets which you want to read.p  pSo I imagine an audio file to look like this, internally Its made up of a lot of packets. If its an audio file which has an variable bit rate format, then every packet may have a different size. If the file has an constant bit rate format, then every packet is the same size. So an audio file is like a truck full of boxes, and every box contains some interesting stuff.p  pIs that correct Does it apply to any kind of file Is this how files actually look likep

Negative 104810 pI have a web application that accesses a database through a wcf service.  The idea is to abstract the data from the web application using the wcf service.  All that works fine but I am also using the built in roleprovider using the SqlRoleManager which does access the aspnetdb database directly.  I would like to abstract the roleprovider by creating a custom roleprovider in a wcf service and then accessing it through the wcf service.p  pI have created the custom role provider and it works fine but now I need to place it in a wcf service.  p  pSo before I jump headlong into trying to get this to work through the WCF service, I created a second class in the web application that accessed the roleprovider class and changed my web config roleprovider parameters to use that class.  So my roleprovider class is called, UcfCstRoleProvider and my web.config looks like thisp  precode    ltroleManager      enabledtrue      defaultProviderUcfCstRoleProvidergt   ltprovidersgt     ltadd          nameUcfCstRoleProvider          typeUcf.Security.Wcf.WebTests.UcfCstRoleProvider, Ucf.Security.Wcf.WebTests          connectionStringNameSqlRoleManagerConnection          applicationNameSMTP gt   ltprovidersgt ltroleManagergt codepre  pMy class starts like thisp  precode    public class UcfCstRoleProvider  RoleProvider      private readonly WindowsTokenRoleProvider roleProxy  new WindowsTokenRoleProvider      public override string ApplicationName              get                      return roleProxy.ApplicationName                  set                      roleProxy.ApplicationName  value               codepre  pAs I said, this works fine.  So the second class is called BlRoleProvider that has identical properties and parameters as the roleprovide but does not implement RoleProvider.  I changed the web.config to point to this class like thisp  precode    ltroleManager      enabledtrue      defaultProviderBlRoleProvidergt   ltprovidersgt     ltadd          nameUcfCstRoleProvider          typeUcf.Security.Wcf.WebTests.BlRoleProvider, Ucf.Security.Wcf.WebTests          connectionStringNameSqlRoleManagerConnection          applicationNameSMTP gt   ltprovidersgt ltroleManagergt codepre  pBut I get this error. Provider must implement the class System.Web.Security.RoleProvider.p  pI hope I have explained well enough to show what I am trying to do.  If I can get the roleprovider to work through another class in the same application, I am sure it will work through the WCF service but how do I get past this errorp  pOr maybe I took a wrong turn and there is a better way to do what I want to dop

Negative 104810 pIm having something of an issue with trying to load externally defined classes in actionscript 3.0. I believe this to be an issue with my understanding of the ApplicationDomain  LoaderContext classes, but even after going over the documentation and a couple of web searches Im still stuck.p  pEssentially what I want to do is load a swf that contains a symbol that is an implementation of an interface shared between the calling swf and the loaded swf. I can load the swf fine and instantiate and execute methods on it fine, but only so long as I dont attempt to cast it to the shared interface type. If I do attempt to cast it, I get a TypeError Error 1034 Type Coercion failed type error.p  pI suspected this is because when I load the new class flash is recognizing it as a completely different class, hence the exception. The a hrefhttphelp.adobe.comenUSas3devWS5b3ccc516d4fbf351e63e3d118a9b902047e13.html relnofollowdocumentationa suggests the use of a LoaderContext argument, with applicationDomain set to ApplicationDomain.currentDomain.p  pThe problem is this has no effect. Regardless of whether I set the ApplicationDomain to currentDomain, null, or a child of the current domain, I still get an type coercion failed error.

Negative 104810 pI have a longstanding C .NET 3.5 application freeze which I am at a loss with. There are two C executables.

Negative 104810 pI want to have a popup window such that when the user hovers mouse over the image, it displays that popup window on the right of the image.

I tried various scripts that are on the internet, but they show the text as innerhtml of the same page. So that breaks my original page. Is there a way to have a box with text and graphics come up when I roll over the image and go away when I close itp

So I cannot just use usual Valueapp.resources.path and get it resolved by Spring automatically.p  pAll I have there is the web application context instance, so I have to resolve my property programmatically.p  pSo far I triedp  pResourceTag.javap  precode returns null PropertyResolver resolver  getRequestContext.getWebApplicationContext.getBeanPropertyResolver.class resolver.getPropertyapp.resources.path    returns null, its the same web context instance as expected PropertyResolver resolver2  WebApplicationContextUtils.getRequiredWebApplicationContextpageContext.getServletContext.getBeanPropertyResolver.class resolver2.getPropertyapp.resources.path    throws NPE, resolver3 is null as StringValueResolver is not bound StringValueResolver resolver3  getRequestContext.getWebApplicationContext.getBeanStringValueResolver.class resolver3.resolveStringValueapp.resources.path    null, since context propertyplaceholder does not register itself as PropertySource Environment env  getRequestContext.getWebApplicationContext.getEnvironment env.getPropertyapp.resources.path codepre  pSo now Im kinda stuck with that. I know that the ability to resolve my placeholder is somewhere in the context, I just dont know the correct way to do it.br Any help or ideas to check are highly appreciated. p

Negative 104810 pAll p  pIm working on creating a poor mans hierarchical storage management solution for my file servers in Amazon. What I would like to do is move files from my file server in EC2 with an atime  30 days to S3 and leave a stub file behind. When a user, using POSIX standard commands attempts to access the file in any way it would be copied back onto the host and them manipulated there, this operation should be transparent to the user, other than being slow. I am assuming that when a user accesses a stub file I can copy the full file over the stub file transparently to the userp  pIm using ext3 and I cant find any information on creating file system stub files, or if I could use a couple of lines of pythonbash as the path to the actual file in S3. p  pMy other option, also a good one I think is to mount a POSIXltS3 file system on the file server, S3QL [2] or S3FS [3] seem to be good choices. I still need to help with creating the stub files, but a least this way the stub file target is on a POSIX file system on the same server. I let S3QL or S3FS deal with the POSIX lt S3 interface.p  pMaybe all I need is a good stub file HOWTO, but any help would be very much appreciated, thank you very, very much.p  p[1] a hrefhttpcode.google.comps3ql relnofollowhttpcode.google.comps3qla p [2] a hrefhttpcode.google.comps3fswikiFuseOverAmazon relnofollowhttpcode.google.comps3fswikiFuseOverAmazonap  pCp

Negative 104810 pmy problem is quite simple, but very important in general  I think. I have done research for a few hours but didnt find anything useful.p  pIntroductionbr I have entity that is named Employee  which is central class of my systemlets say its HR Management. By writing central I have on my mind that it has many relations to other entites. There are OneToOne, OneToMany and ManyToOne properties in it.  Problembr In some cases I have to refresh this entityit has also basic properties like String name and so on  after it was changed in one EntityManager contexthibernate Session and has to be refreshed in other. Of course I can use for itp  precodeentityManager.refreashemployee codepre  pbut... it also will refresh like one hundred related entitesmentioned 11, em1, 1em relations, because those relations have annotation parameter Cascade.All or Cascade.REFREASH for them.  What is not needed in that situation  I only use Employee entity itself in this context. And what is NOT WANTED because it will strike performance and even locally takes like 0.5 s...br Questionbr Is there any way to refresh entity optionally turning off cascades on its properties. Or maybe is there any way to refresh only specific properties of entity using HibernateJPAp  pI really dont want those 20 ore more long SQL queries triggered by Hibernate, when I refresh my entity in those situations, but in other situations it is wanted. p  pIn other words, I would say that I need option like respectCascadesOnRefreshtruefalse that can be set before refreash. p  pAny other ideasp  pAny help appreciated,p  pPedrop

Negative 104810 pWhen defining a simple web service in Java Eclipse and consuming the service in Visual Studio, the generated code contains a request and response structure for each service method. The generated client interface has methods that accept the request structure and return the value from the response structure.p  pFor instance, if I have a service class SimpleTest with a method addint a, int b, I get the following generated interface annotations removedp  precodepublic interface ISimpleTest      MyNamespace.WebServiceProxy.addResponse add         MyNamespace.WebServiceProxy.addRequest request  codepre  pHowever, if I create essentially the same class as a WCF web service, the code generates the following interfacep  precodepublic interface ISimpleTest                       int Addint a, int b  codepre  pId like to figure out if theres a way to avoid using the wrapper classes when consuming a Java service. Would defining datatypes in an XSD allow this or will .NET always generate these wrappers when consuming a non.NET service Wed like to bypass the generated client and implement the interface ourselves without the wrappers. Is this possiblep

Negative 104810 pThis would be a great challenge for someone with knowledge of VBA and unmanaged C.p  pFirst, we have obtained a third party dll with little to no documentation on its API use however we did obtain an Excel spreadsheet using the dll. The problem is when we tried porting the code over to C things have gone from bad to worse. I have a funny feeling that were missing one tiny thing...p  pAnyway the code from the spread sheet is as follows..p  precodeDeclare Sub someFunction Lib Csomedll.dll  types1 As TYPE1,  vals1 As Double, vals2 As Double,  type2 As TYPE2, type3 As TYPE3, types4 As TYPE4,  vals3 As Double  ... Logic to fill in the arrays and create UDTs etc.  Call someFunctiontypes10, vals10, vals20,  type2, type3, types40, vals30 codepre  pOption Explicit is set so all arrays are dimensioned or Dim and they are using UDT for things like TYPE1, TYPE2 etc. p  pThe issue now is when I port over to C I do not get the expected results as I see in VBA. p  pMy C code is as follows...p  precode    [DllImportcsomedll.dll, CallingConvention  CallingConvention.ThisCall]     private static extern void someFunction ref TYPE1[] types1,                                                ref double[] vals1,                                                ref double[] vals2,                                                TYPE2 type2,                                                TYPE3 type3,                                                ref TYPE4[] types4,                                                ref double[] vals3   ...   in a method after all arrays are initialized etc    someFunctionref types1, ref vals1, ref vals2, type2, type3, ref types4, ref vals3    PInvoke function someFunction has an unbalanced stack. Signatures are off etc. codepre  pProblem is the code is almost identical to VBA minus the Arrays not being dynamic and structures in C defined using marshaling. Heres an example of a struct ...p  precode [StructLayoutLayoutKind.Sequential, CharSet  CharSet.Ansi]  public class TYPE3       public double t1     public double t2     public double t3   codepre  pAlso I noted that the all the arrays passed in VBA version are being manipulated even though you are passing in the index 0 of the array. Could this have to do with them passing the pointer to the array in VBA p  pAnyway, this has really been confusing me as of lately as I have tried everything including pointers IntPtr etc. p  pEven tried calling the dll from C. But that presented a whole new slew of problems that I wont discuss here. p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated and please let me know if I can provide more information this is my first post on here so Ill be more than glad to help out as much as I can.p  pBest Regards,p  pKarimp
Negative 104810 pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions26961823indexbuffers3 index buffersa asks a more difficult question, but I feel like their main problem boils down to mine is there a way to use index buffers to visit the same vertex multiple times in WebGL rather than duplicating the vertices All I was able to find is using index buffers to associate textures, normals, etc. to vertices in a model. I wasnt able to find a way to use an index buffer to tell drawArrays the order in which to visit the vertices in a position array.p

Negative 104810 pI have the following problem I have two webpages, codea.phpcode and codeb.phpcode. The first page displays a list of items from a database, and the other page updates it and sends the user back to the previous page by using codewindow.history.backcode.p  pHowever, when I go from codea.phpcode to codeb.phpcode, update some entries in the database and go back, the list does not update without reloading the page manually.

I also have a working view that serves the plot from file. The deform form kind of works, too. At the moment it is unclear to me how to best structure the ULRs to distinguish the serve, edit and render usecases.

Run the example with GoogleChrome the latest version, and NO widget installed and it takes me through the Facebook process but on the redirection of a successful loginconnect it comes up that my session only has a single variable state, and says Im still not connected. I look in my installed applications on Facebook and it is definitely installed.p  pAt first I thought there was something wrong with my session or maybe the browser, so I tried the same process in Safari, FireFox, Opera and even Internet Explorer 7. ALL WORKED PERFECTLYp  pIs there a known issue with GoogleChromep  pAs for any code, I didnt change a single thing, whatever is in the latest branch of the Facebook SDK PHP Github is what I used.p  pAny ideas or is anyone else experiencing the same problems with GoogleChrome, its really frustrating because GoogleChrome would be my preferred browser and it means that Im going to have to test my Facebook application on a different browser and if it goes public users of GoogleChrome arent going to experience my application at all.p

Negative 104810 pI have a question about recursive data structures in Haskell language that  Im currently trying to learn.p  pI would like to encode in Haskell Prologlike terms, but every solution I came up with has different drawbacks that I would really like to avoid.

Negative 104810 pThe following simple code example illustrates the scenario in question. I have a Person entity, which is simply mapped to the Person table in the DB. I am using the default Entity Object code generator.p  precodepublic partial class Person  ...  codepre  pI have a PersonDetail class deriving from Person, which contains some extra properties, which are needed by the GUI. None of these properties needs to be persisted in the DB, so I do not want to map this class to the database.p  precodepublic class PersonDetail  Person      public int TheGuiNeedsThisInformation  get set   codepre  pAnd I send down instances of the Detail class the GUI with WCF. My problem is, if the GUI modifies some properties of the PersonDetail instance, and sends it back to the server to update it, I can not simply Attach it to my context, because the derived class is not mapped to any table Mapping and metadata information could not be found for EntityType PersonDetail. I tried to map it to the same table as the Person class is mapped, but the EF throws some exception about the mapping that way.p  pI managed to workaround this by creating a copy of the PersonDetail instance by copying its property values to a new Person instance, and then saving it to the DB. However I would like to avoid that extra work. What am I doing wrong Is this not possible In Linq to SQL this worked like a charm, basically out of the box.p  pAnd if this is not possible, what is the suggested way to extend my entity classes with some extra information, which dont have to be persisted The obvious way would be to simply add extra properties to the partial Person class. However, i do not want to do that, because that way the GUI can never be sure whether the extra properties have been filled on the server or not.p  pUPDATE Thanks for the suggestions, however my main question is still open Is it possible to have a base and a derived class where the derived class does not have any additional properties which have to be saved to the DB mapped to the same table, so that I can simply attach an instance of the derived type to my context and save it like if it was an instance of the base type I could not do this yet, and I am surprised, because with Linq to SQL it simply worked.p

Negative 104810 pI am interested to see if anyone has some good ideasbest practice for the folder names and structure of their image folders, plus the naming of the actual images.p  pA nonimportant question but one that has been bugging me. At the end of a build I can end up with an overflowing image folder  mostly in one giant list. I try to name my images with what I think is a form of logic e.g. locationpurposemeasurements. p  pFor a website we can split it into header, footer, article etc, but for the images different rules should surely apply. hrdlogo224x45.jpg is great in respect that I know its a logo for the header and its measurements. Semantically though the use of hdr would confuse things in the future if for some reason the client wanted it used in the footer instead or in amongst the main content. Creating a folder in the images folder called header could also confuse things.

Negative 104810 pIm putting together an application to help manage the repairs we process here at work. Ive been instructed to go down the WPF route. Brief into to the scenerio is I would say the data structure is fairly simple, but its the changing business processes that make it more complex. Like any repair as you would expect there is an RMA form filled in by a customer, in this system this becomes an RMA object that contains a lengthy list of properties to record customer entered details and then details entered by the engineers during the repair until its dispatched. Data storage is a database on a webserver protected by OAuth. Course APIs to retrieve data i.e. all p  pI am fine with XAML to create the WPF which was the first hurdle, and some knowledge of ViewModelView interaction using Commands  data binding. I am more stuck on the architecture at this point. Firstly people do the creationlinking of ViewViewModel differently. Also from my research IoC is the way to go, but every tutorial I read does it in a different way using a variety of IoC frameworks i.e. UnitySpring. And its at this point I have gotten lost amongest the terminology and the variety was ways to achieve the same thing.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comesOwf.jpg altPreview of repair systemp  pAbove is a screenshot of how the application will end up looking. Originally created in photoshop by our web designer and I turned it into xaml. Obviously the tab control showing SummaryJobSheet isnt finished p  pAs you can see the application has 3 main areas.p  p1 The header with a search box, p  p2 A list of buttons down the side which vary based on a users role these act much like filters in GMail, show all pending repairs, starred repairs etc, the tabbed view in the middle.p  p3 The tabbed view has a main tab based on the button clicked down the side, and other tabs i.e. an open RMA, Customer, etc. The idea of the application is you scan a barcode on an RMA form, that data number is put into the search box, which queries the web services through a repository gets the RMA data as a Json string, builds the RMA object from Json, creates a ViewModel for it and displays it as a tab.p  pIve looked through a few tutorials already, but as I say they all differ and am not sure on the approach to take, such as.p  pNaked mvvm  a hrefhttpblog.vuscode.commalovicnarchive20101107nakedmvvmsimplestpossiblemvvmapproach.aspxcomments relnofollowhttpblog.vuscode.commalovicnarchive20101107nakedmvvmsimplestpossiblemvvmapproach.aspxcommentsap  pJohn Smith  a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenusmagazinedd419663.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenusmagazinedd419663.aspxap  pMvvm in the box  a hrefhttpkarlshifflett.wordpress.com20101107intheboxndashmvvmtraining relnofollowhttpkarlshifflett.wordpress.com20101107intheboxndashmvvmtrainingap  pstrongQuestionstrong With this in mind can anyone advise on the best architecture to use in this application.

Negative 104810 pI am working on a java application whose job is to create and save XML large size. The sample i got is 300 MB XML file. p  pThe app was designed to collect bulk data from the database and save it in XML format. The application because of its heavy IO and memory usage was designed to process MAX 3 such requests parallel. p  pNow the requirement is to make it process up to 50 such requests parallel. The current app uses XMLbean to create the XML then saves it to the file system. The application is exposed as a web service on weblogic server its on a 64 bit OS and Java MAX Heap size id 4 GB. p  pI need your opinion onp  p1 Is there an XML API that works with XSD and can be used to create large XMLs 200200 MB with minimum overhead  XMLbean works fine for us, but is there something that can handle it better p  p2 What will be the best and most memory efficient way to save it to file system   i am thinking of changing the current writer to bufferedWriter and have it save 1024 bytes to memory before a physical write to disk happens.  Can there be any side effect to increasing it p  p3 If there is no limit on technology choice and server etc  what will be the ideal solution p  pEDIT 1 The DB access is fast about 5 of total time.

Negative 104810 pId like to create a UITableViewCell with two TextLabels in blue text on the left, and two DetailTextLabels in black on the right, as similar in style to UITableViewCellStyleValue2 as possible.p  pUp to now, Ive set the TextLabel and DetailTextLabel text to be something really long so that itll take up the entirety of the width assigned to the blue labels, set the font to UIColor.Clear, and then taken their measurements each time theyre rendered. Thats horrible for lots of reasons, but it works in a fashion.p  pId like to accomplish this with a custom UIView and a custom Draw method. This is a prettier solution but now im missing a vital piece of information the width of the area used to display a TextLabel. I could hard code it, which seems the accepted way to do things on iOS even if it makes me feel dirty, but then I have to hard code it for iPad and iPhone both in Horizontal and Vertical orientations.

If there was a way to ensure that no 2 codecharcodes can point to the same codestructcode without checking every other codecharcode when inserting a new element onto the map that would be neat, but that is not strictly necessary. I also need to be able to remove pairings from the map, and to reinsert the pairings with the same Key but different pointers.p  pI have thought this through, and figured I could create a pointer array the length of all possible chars, and just store the corresponding pointer using the char as the array index since it is just a number constant. This might very well work but it seems kind of inefficient to allocate that much space for addresses if I end up using only a couple of chars in my application.p  pStill, I wasnt able to think of any alternative solutions considering Im a C newbie, not that surprising. I would be grateful for any, if even vague, suggestions in the right direction.p

But during this discussion what we find out StringBuilder doesnt have any override Equals method in its implementation. So when we call StringBuilder.Equals it actually goes to Object.Equals. So if someone calls StringBuilder.Equals and S1.EqualsS2 the result will be different. p

Negative 104810 pI have a question. I working on one site on Asp.Net, which uses some ORM. I need to use a couple of FullTextSearch functions, such as Contains. But when I try to generate it with that ORM, it generates such SQL codep  precode    SELECT      [Extent1].[ID] AS [ID],      [Extent1].[Name] AS [Name]      FROM [dbo].[SomeTable] AS [Extent1]     WHERE Contains[Extent1].[Name], Nqq  1 codepre  pSQL cant parse it, because Contains doesnt return bit value. And unfortunately I cant modify SQL query generation process, but I can modify statements in it.p  pMy question is  is it possible to wrap call of CONTAINS function to something else I tried to create another function, that will SELECT with contains, but it requires specific tablecolumn objects, and I dont want to do one function for each table..p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI can modify result type for that function in ORM. In previous sample result type is Bit. I can change it to int,nvarchar,etc. But as I understood there is no Boolean type in SQL, and I cant specify it.p

Negative 104810 pI use Vim to edit English text files with 10.000 words and long paragraphs. The files are formatted as plain text and each paragraph is a long line. I use the codewrapcode option, and I bind codejcode and codekcode to codegjcode and codegkcode respectively so I can move by display lines.p  pIf my cursor is on the top of the screen but not the beginning of the document and I move the cursor up using codegkcode, the screen scrolls up to display the whole long line a 300word paragraph. The problem is that because of the length of the line this makes the screen scroll by half of the screen. This is disorienting because I dont know beforehand how much the screen will move. Scrolling with codeYcode has the same problem.p  pIs there a way to make Vim scroll by just one display line when using codegkcode and its ilk This is more natural for editing nonsourcecode and the default behavior in most text editors as well as in word processors, but not in Vim. I think this would mean that Vim would have to stop insisting on showing the entire line Im editing.p

Negative 104810 pmy topic is similarity and clustering of a bunch of texts. In a nutshell I want to cluster collected texts together and they should appear in meaningful clusters at the end. To do this, my approach up to now is as follows, my problem is in the clustering. The current software is written in php.p  p1 Similarity I treat every document as a bagofwords and convert words into vectors. I usep  ul lifiltering only real wordsli litokenization split sentences into wordsli listemming reduce words to their base form Porters stemmerli lipruning cut of words with too high amp low frequencyli ul  pas methods for dimensionality reduction. After that, Im using cosine similarity as suggested  described on various sites on the web a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma1290286519270and herea.p  pThe result then is a similarity matrix like thisp  precode        A   B   C   D   E      A   0  30  51  75  80     B   X   0  21  55  70     C   X   X   0  25  10     D   X   X   X   0  15     E   X   X   X   X   0 codepre  pAE are my texts and the number is the similarity in percent the higher, the more similar the texts are. Because simA,B  simB,A only half of the matrix is filled in. So the similarity of Text A to Text D is 71.p  pI want to generate a a priori unknown number of clusters out of this matrix now. The clusters should represent the similar items up to a certain stopp criterion together.p  pI tried a basic implementation myself, which was basically like this 60 as a fixed similarity thresholdp  precode    foreach article       get similar entries where sim gt 60               foreach similar entry               check if one of the entries already has a cluster number               if no assign new cluster number to all similar entries               if yes use that number codepre  pIt worked somehow, but wasnt good at all and the results were often monsterclusters. So, I want to redo this and already had a look into all kinds of clustering algorithms, but Im still not sure which one will work best. I think it should be an agglomerative algoritm, because every pair of texts can be seen as a cluster in the beginning. But still the questions are what the stopp criterion is and if the algorithm should divide and  or merge existing clusters together.p  pSorry if some of the stuff seems basic, but I am relatively new in this field.

Negative 104810 pIm making improvements to a thermalhydraulics code written in Fortran by having it write its mesh data to VTK files that can be opened in a visualizer.  Previously, data was simply written to a text file that the user had to manipulate by hand.  I write two files one for scalar data, which includes the vertices of the sructured mesh cells and the scalar data inside them, the second file for vector data.  Because of the solution algorithm, the vectors lie on the faces of the mesh cells, so I define their location using Polydata points.  p  pI tested my modifications for a small, 500 cell mesh and it worked fine, but Ive tried to move up to a bigger, 9,000 cell mesh.  The vectors dont display right.  The mesh has 18 cells in the xdirection, 18 cells in the ydirection and 29 cells in the zdirection.  In the picture I attached below, you can see that there are 18 vectors in the ydirection, which is correct, but only 7 vectors in the ydirection.  I reduced the zdirection mesh to 3 levels to reduce the complexity for here.  I need to determine if this is an issue with the visualizer, the VTK file, or my code.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comSWPBW.png altenter image description herep  pI checked the VTK file and it looks to me that everything is there.  Actually, the previous attempt I made involved printing data so the zdirection coordinates varied fastest, then x, then y and that produced a staggered set of vectors in the zdirection.  Making it so x varied fastest, then y, then z produced what you see above.  I was surprised to see this made a difference because the actual content of the VTK file doesnt change.  Of course, I have trouble with writing to VTK format because I cant find much information on it online, so I could be missing something obvious.  Im attaching the VTK file I wrote below to see if theres something Im overlooking.  Its a very long file, so I got rid of most of the data for this post and just left the two header sections and a few data points.p  precode vtk DataFile Version 1.0 Vector Data ASCII DATASET POLYDATA POINTS     972 double 0.33500000E02  0.33500000E02  0.00000000E00 0.13000000E01  0.33500000E02  0.00000000E00 0.25600000E01  0.33500000E02  0.00000000E00 0.38200000E01  0.33500000E02  0.00000000E00 0.50800000E01  0.33500000E02  0.00000000E00 0.63400000E01  0.33500000E02  0.00000000E00 ... up to 972 values POINTDATA     972 VECTORS AxialLiquidMassFlowRate float          0.0000E00  0.0000E00  0.9075E01 0.0000E00  0.0000E00  0.1636E00 0.0000E00  0.0000E00  0.1636E00 0.0000E00  0.0000E00  0.1636E00 0.0000E00  0.0000E00  0.1636E00 0.0000E00  0.0000E00  0.1636E00 ... up to 972 values codepre  pstrongIn reference to Chris commentstrongp  pFirst, the code actually uses two meshes in keeping with the staggered mesh approach 1 a scalar mesh in which the continuity and energy equations are solved in pressure, density, enthalpy, and void fraction are defined at the centers of the scalar mesh cells, 2 a momentum cell mesh in which the momentum equations are solved in velocity is defined at the centers of the momentum mesh cells.  The scalar mesh is defined by the user and the momentum mesh is built on top of it so that the centers of the momentum cells lie on the faces of the scalar cells.  p  pI thought such a mesh would best be captured using the rectilinear format of VTK, but I couldnt figure out how to capture a nonsquare or rectangular geometry, such as the one shown herep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comeWLMg.jpg altenter image description herep  pSo instead, I used an unstructured grid because all the cell vertice information was easily obtainable this was also easier to print out from the code because I didnt have to make considerations for the connectivity of the cells.  The momentum cells will actually overlap each other because they are setup so that the centers are on the scalar cell faces.  Therefore, only the centers of the cells are important, which is why I used points instead of a mesh to define the velocity vectors.  See the previous figure if I add in a few momentum mesh cells, shown by the red dashed linesp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com3DkxZ.jpg altenter image description herep  pI modified the code so that each scalar cell now has six arrays associated with it 1 xlocationi,j  the x location, in meters, of the center of the scalar mesh cell 2 ylocationi,j  the y location of the center of the scalar mesh cell 3 zlocationi,j  the z location of the center of the scalar mesh cell 4 xsizei,j  the size of the scalar cell in the x direction 5 ysizei,j  the size of the scalar cell in the y direction 6 zsizei,j  the size of the scalar cell in the z directionp  pThe i index represents a column of cells a channel stacked in the z direction.  The j index represents a layer of cells, spanning the x,y directions.p  pA cell can be uniquely identified by the i and j indices.  All scalar cell data is also given with respect to these indices i.e. densityi,j, enthalpyi,j, pressurei,j, etc..p

Negative 104810 pI am using Hadoop to analyze a very uneven distribution of data.  Some keys have thousands of values, but most have only one.  For example, network traffic associated with IP addresses would have many packets associated with a few talkative IPs and just a few with most IPs.  Another way of saying this is that the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiGiniindex relnofollowGini indexa is very high.p  pTo process this efficiently, each reducer should either get a few highvolume keys or a lot of lowvolume keys, in such a way as to get a roughly even load.  I know how I would do this if I were writing the partition process I would take the sorted list of codekeyscode including all duplicate keys that was produced by the mappers as well as the number of reducers codeNcode and put splits atp  precodesplit[i]  keys[floorilenkeysN] codepre  pReducer codeicode would get keys codekcode such that codesplit[i] lt k lt split[i1]code for code0 lt i lt N1code and codesplit[i] lt kcode for codei  N1code.p  pIm willing to write my own partitioner in Java, but the a hrefhttphadoop.apache.orgmapreducedocsr0.21.0apiorgapachehadoopmapreducePartitioner.html relnofollowPartitionerltKEY,VALUEgta class only seems to have access to one keyvalue record at a time, not the whole list.  I know that Hadoop sorts the records that were produced by the mappers, so this list must exist somewhere.  It might be distributed among several partitioner nodes, in which case I would do the splitting procedure on one of the sublists and somehow communicate the result to all other partitioner nodes.  Assuming that the chosen partitioner node sees a randomized subset, the result would still be approximately loadbalanced.  strongDoes anyone know where the sorted list of keys is stored, and how to access itstrongp  pI dont want to write two mapreduce jobs, one to find the splits and another to actually use them, because that seems wasteful.  The mappers would have to do the same job twice.  This seems like a general problem uneven distributions are pretty common.p

Negative 104810 pThe question is given at the end. Before it comes after some details about what I tried.p  pEDIT I guess in technical terms I am looking for the scrollbar thumb position.p  pSome background on my issue I have created an access database to storetrack issue data at an engineering firm where I work, each issue has 15 or so data fields and a picture. Because of the frequency of outofoffice use data is stored on network server, db is local to each user the pictures are not embedded in each record due to the immense size of the resulting database, instead they are stored on the server with the db tables and each record contains location info so that when selected, each record dynamically embeds the pics from their stored location. The reason for this of course is to reduce db size and speed up loading from remote locations.p  pgetting to the point...p  pSo moving on, yesterday we had a review of what Ive come up with so far, and several of the future users want me to include a continuous form that they would be able to scroll through to quickly identify a specific issue by the picture, which would be displayed on each recurrence of the form for the continuous form. Well, that sort of defeats the purpose and all of the effort Ive gone through to make this database not painfully slow to use. If I did exactly as asked, access would have to insert the picture for every issue every time the form loads and that could be painfully slow.p  pThe actual question...p  pMy first thoughts on their request were what if I somehow made it so that access would only run the code to insert the picture when the picture is scrolled toover.p  pMy logic was although if the user scrolls through all records it will still have to load all of the pictures, I could write in the code to make it wait x seconds or something along those lines, aside from the point, either way it would stretch out the time spent loading so that it would be less noticeable to the user, rightp  pMY ACTUAL QUESTIONp  pSo is there a way to know, for a continuous form, what the scrollbar position is I have searched far and wide on the internet for a working solution, but found nothing.p

Negative 104810 pSo I need to allow clients to record audio to the internet. Best solution Ive found so far which keeps them on our site is the Soundcloud API and I just give them our account details and they use a version of the Soundcloud recorder FlashJavascript hacked together for out site.p  pMain issue is, these recordings are long. Maybe up to an hour. Because Soundcloud API records in the browser then uploads the audio and transcodes on its server theres a lot to go wrong in the upload process which takes a long time with a big file. Its ok if we just record the audio in say 20 min chunks but its just not that reliable.p  pWe tried to build our own using wamirecorder, but that meant transcoding from wav to MP3 in the browser before upload to make the file smaller, but taking more time on the client machine  at least Soundcloud does the transcoding serverside. p  pGiven the size of the files should I be looking at a server side recorderstreaming solution based on red5 or something, or is a client side recorder with upload a better proposal p  pthanks a lotp

My question is specificly about garbage collecting arrays of Objects.p  pFor example when the user presses a menu item a JDialog is invoked with lots of components in it, these components were instantiated at the moment that the program runs, but i want to instantiate them when necessary and free them when not.p  pFor examplep  precodeJRadioButton Options  new JRadioButton[20] for int i  0 i lt 20 i      Options[i]  new JRadioButtonLabels[i]  codepre  pIf i want to free the arrays, what shoud i dop  pThisp  precodefor int i  0 i lt 20 i      Options[i]  null     Labels[i]  null  codepre  pOr simplyp  precodeOptions  null Labels  null codepre  pThanks in advancep

Negative 104810 pI have a Types project where I define custom class objects that I want to work on in my main application.  The objects are basically derived from strings and parsed into a structure.  p  pI have two problemsp  p1  In a separate project I have a File reader class where I scan text files for the string types I have defined.  For  example by regular expression.  Currently I added my Types project as a project reference and I just list the regular expressions at the top of my read class. When i find a type I convert the string to the appropriate type. However how can i improve this so that is it directly connected to my Types project  so when i update it with new types the Read class knows that it should support the new typesp  p2  Im trying to create a DLL that works on these specific types after they are read from the text file.

Now i want to make it so that 1 client has the option to only download his part, BUT he still has to use MY main app. in other words i dont want to reference to another APK, cause then he can start his app without using minei thinkbr And the download option should be at runtime, cause else he has to download everything in one go.br I have thought about using jar files as library files, but what i found so far is that you have to add them in Eclipse else they are not found I also thought about building the app with the jar files in it, and then leave them out when i compile the app. Then my client can download those files afterwards. But i am guessing that will cause reference errorsp  pSo the questions arep  ol liIs it possible li liHow to go aboutli ol  pThe main idea is that i dont want to make one HUGE app where as my client will only use his part of it.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 104810 pIm using gSOAP to generate XML parsing code from XSD Schema I prepared myself. It has nothing to do with web services. The XML data is read from a local file or in memory buffer by providing proper codeistreamcode to codesoapcode.p  pAt first it seems simple enough. But now as I use it more and more Im starting to see some issues.p  pFor example names are introduced in global namespace. It is possible to enforce use of a namespace but then building becomes much more difficult due to need of generating extra code for error handling, only one namespace can be used and due to use of macros it might cause other issues as well.p  pAnd you DO need those namespaces once you have more than one schema per binary building unit code.execode, code.dllcode, ...p  pSo I started to think about some alternative maybe. Especially that I dont need that web services staff. Only automatic code generation for parsing XML based on XSD.p  pAre there any such alternatives for native C What are theyp

Negative 104810 pI am in the process of developing a lengthy list view that is created from a JSON array coming from my server. When an item is selected it could be anywhere in the list  and when I return I want to jump back to that specific item.p  pI was thinking about the setSelectionposition structure but I was curious as to how the position variable is set. Does it need to come from the JSON string or is it a variable that is created while the list view is being filled. If it is created what is the syntax of retrieving it so I can pass it to the Activity in charge of displaying more data and then back to the original Activity when the list view is redisplayed.p  pAs additional information I just added the functionality of storing it in my preferences so it will load faster so it is stored on the phone. If the data has changed due to user interaction I retrieve the new JSON string so maintaining position is not critical.p  pI was hoping to not need to rebuild my JSON string to contain this variable.p  pThanksp

Negative 104810 pSo basically I would like to call an iMacro script from a web browser via url using PHP in a MAMP environment.

Negative 104810 pIm working on an android app that needs to constantly get location data, or as constantly as possible.

And B needs to immediately stop what it is doing and read the information.p  pThis is like a tcp stack, let me say, process A is responsible for receiving  data packets or ack packets, and process B is responsible for sending packets. when Process A receives a data packet, process B should read the data packet, update seq number and ackseq number for its next outgoing packet.p  pAnyway, my idea is process A and B should share a structure variable, and there is a lock on the varialbe. B keeps on reading the varialbe, when A receives a packet, it lock the variable, thus B is blocked. After A modify the variable, A unlock it and B get to read the variable and then continue to do its own job.

Negative 104810 pI have discovered the hard way that if a file has a valid UTF8 BOM but contains any invalid UTF8 encodings, and is read by any of the Delphi 2009 encodingenabled methods such as codeLoadFromFilecode, then the result is a completely empty file with no error indication. In several of my applications, I would prefer to simply lose a few bad encodings, even if I get no error report in this case either.p  pDebugging reveals that codeMultiByteToWideCharcode is called twice, first to get the output buffer size, then to do the conversion.  But TEncoding.UTF8 contains a private codeFMBToWCharFlagscode value for these calls, and this is initialized with a codeMBERRINVALIDCHARScode value.  So the call to get the charcount returns 0 and the loaded file is completely empty.  Calling this API without the flag would silently drop illegal code points.p  pMy question is how best to weave through the nest of classes in the Encoding area to work around the fact that this is a private value and needs to be, because it is a class var for all threads. I think I could add a custom UTF8 encoding, using the guidance in Marco Cantus Delphi 2009 book. And it could optionally raise an exception if codeMultiByteToWideCharcode has returned an encoding error, after calling it again without the flag.  But that does not solve the problem of how to get my custom encoding used instead of codeTencoding.UTF8code.p  pIf I could just set this up as a default for the application at initialization, perhaps by actually modifying the class var for codeTencoding.UFT8code, this would probably be sufficient.p  pOf course, I need a solution without waiting to lodge a QC report asking for a more robust design, getting it accepted, and seeing it changed.p  pAny ideas would be very welcome.  And can someone confirm this is still an issue for XE4, which I have not yet installedp

Hack is to do the followingp  precodeul      liststyle none     width 100       Hack to keep Text  Empty Text Node elements from taking up space.      letterspacing 4px     wordspacing 4px   ul gt li

Negative 104810 pSeems crazy to be doing this at this late date, but...p  pI am rebuilding some ETL infrastructure with a Rocket Software UniVerse source and an SQL destination. The old destination platform was SQL 2000 on Windows Server 2003, the new platform is SQL 2012 on Windows Server 2012. In both cases, an ODBC driver is used to connect to the source. Everything seems to work fine on the new platform, but the execution time for a package is exponentially slower. For example, one table with roughly 1.3 Million rows and 28 Columns takes about an hour using SQL 2000DTS and over 3.5 hours using SQL 2012SSIS. Both SQL servers are virtualized on Xen Server, the 2012 server has more RAM and more vCPUs, neither machine has an advantage in disk infrastructure. No metrics Memory, disk IO, etc. are redlining or really even coming close on the 2012 server during package execution.p  pI have read several forum posts describing the same scenario, but none really seemed to have a solution that works for me. Since all of these posts were quite dated most of these conversions from DTS to SSIS happened in the SQL 2005 days, I was curious if there was any fresher info out there.p  pThe packages are very simple table copies, no transforms. I am using a SELECT column, column,.. FROM sourcetable for my source connection and Table or View  Fast Load for my destination. The slow down APPEARS to be on the source side of the equation, though I cant be certain.p  pAny help appreciated.p

Negative 104810 pIve developed a software application and have reached the point where I need to find an easier way to supply updates to users.  Ive currently created an Installer application  which is just a simple C application that connects to an FTP server, supplies credentials, brings down the parts of the application and assembles it.  This installer is called by the main application if the user chooses to update their version of the application.  The first step of the installer is to kill the main application process, thereby allowing the files to be overwritten. To determine if a new version is available, the application reads a simple text file that is hosted on my website i.e. www.mydomain.comversionFile.txt .  This text file basically contains the latest version number, which the main application uses to compare to its version.p  pIt all works, but it can be cumbersome if a user is on a site that does not allow FTP access which is often.  p  pSo as not to be subjective, here is my specific question  Is there a secure way to make application files available on a website for downloadbr By secure, I mean the C Installer application needs to supply the correct credentials before being able to download the application files to the users PC.p  pIve seen how one developer distributes his application via a dropbox public folder, but this is open to everyone, which Im trying to avoid.p  pThanks in advance.p  pStevep

Negative 104810 pIve been looking for a solution to a complex problem were having in my company. This company is part of an alliance of 4 companies that covers our country in four regions. Our branch developed a WebService in C and we distribute this project to our fellow developers in the other branches. Everyone hosts the WebService in their own servers.p  pNow, Ive been struggling with something you can expect when the companies dont get along. I have to adapt an existing method to suit our regional needs.p  pSo Ive got this class p  precodepublic partial class MyClass      public static ComplexReturnType MyMethod            National code. Everyone uses this block of code.        codepre  pI created a Regional folder that I will exclude from compilation when distributing the DLL to the other branches. Inside this folder I created the file MyClass.cs and went on with this p  precodepublic partial class MyClass      public static ComplexReturnType MyMethod            Regional code. Only my commpany will use this.        codepre  pThe method codeMyMethodcode is called in other files. I understand how codepartialcode works, but I cant find a solution that suits my needs without creating a child class and rewriting every call already present in the other files.p  pDoes anyone have an idea on how to deal with this p  pstrongEdit after answerstrongp  pI decided to go with the Strategy Design Pattern, and when I was done I thought If a branch decides to overwrite any method, all the other branches have to override the same method with the national code in their regional strategy class.p  pSo thats not really nice. Instead I did this p  precodepublic class VStrategy      public virtual ComplexReturnType MyMethod          National code. Method moved from MyClass          public virtual AnotherReturnType MySecondMethod          National code. Method moved from MyClass        public class SomeBranchStrategy VStrategy      public override ComplexReturnType MyMethod           Regional code for overriding a method        public class AnotherBranchStrategy VStrategy      public override AnotherReturnType MySecondMethod           Regional code for overriding a method        public class MyClass      private static VStrategy strategy  new VStrategy     public static VSTrategy Strategy  get ... set ...      public static ComplexReturnType MyMethod              return Strategy.MyMethod          public static ComplexReturnType MySecondMethod              return Strategy.MySecondMethod       codepre  pThis way, without the Interface, every branch can override any method they want without an impact for the other branches. You just move the method code to the VStrategy class and override it in your own Regional class.p  pHope this helps anyone who could be in this situation.p

Negative 104810 pAre there any real good strategies out there for enabling and disabling menu items based on multiple conditionsp  pExample  I have an editable grid with Save and Cancel toolbar menu items and others.  When the grid is initially loaded, it checks to see if the user has permissions to edit the items.  If the user has permissions hd can edit the grid.  Initially the Save and Cancel are disabled because they are not needed.  If the user makes edits, then I want them both to be enabled.  Currently I do this with what I call FormMode property.  When the user starts editing, it puts the formgrid in Dirty mode and the Save and Cancel buttons are enabled.  If any editable control is changed, it sets this FormMode property to Dirty.  If they hit the Save or Cancel buttons then the data is saved and the buttons are disabled again they are not needed.p  pMy question is, is there a better, more elegant way to handle this enablingdisabling by using events or other properties  I have this same scenario on dozens of forms and grids and it seems like there should be an easier way to deal with it.  Can the menu items be aware of the formgrid state and respond automatically  And could I reuse them over multiple formsp  pIm not sure if my question is clear  sorry if not.  But it seems like I spend a lot of time getting the menu items to behave correctly depending on the mode of the form.  I like to have them only enabled when it is appropriate.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com9mczL.jpg altgrid in initial mode before editingp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comVWftv.jpg altgrid duringafter editingp  pHere is the property setterp  precode Public Property GridDataMode As Mayfran.Base.BaseUtilities.FormMode Implements IGridDataMode.GridDataMode     Get         Return GridDataMode     End Get     SetByVal arg As Mayfran.Base.BaseUtilities.FormMode         if mode is different from previous mode, then continue         If GridDataMode ltgt arg Then             GridDataMode  arg             Select Case GridDataMode                 Case FormMode.Initial                     nothing to do here                 Case FormMode.Dirty, FormMode.NewRecord                     barButtonItemSave.Enabled  Editable                     barButtonItemCancel.Enabled  True                     barButtonItemSelectAll.Enabled  False                     barButtonItemDelete.Enabled  False                     barButtonItemPrint.Enabled  False                     barButtonItemRefresh.Enabled  False                 Case FormMode.RecordLoaded                     barButtonItemSave.Enabled  False                     barButtonItemCancel.Enabled  False                     barButtonItemSelectAll.Enabled  True                     barButtonItemDelete.Enabled  Editable                     barButtonItemPrint.Enabled  True                     barButtonItemRefresh.Enabled  True                 Case Else                     Exit Select             End Select             RaiseEvent GridModeChangedarg         End If     End Set End Property codepre

Negative 104810 pI am struggling with a problem occuring only on very long running requests. I have a web application with the possibility to export a large amount of data on demand in a XML file. Depending on the data the export runs from just a second to several minutes. I tested the export with little data and the xml generation and file download worked well. Then I tested it with a large amount of data and the xml generation ran about 30 minutes due to lots of  database queries.  But the problem for this long running request is that after generating the xml file it is not downloading but generating the file again. While doing the xml generation again the gets an site loading error. The same happened with more data and a xml generation time of more than one hour... So why is this happening This problem occurs only for such requests running about 30 minutes or longer. Is it possible that there is some timeout which starts the request again But the second file generation starts exactly after finishing the first and not after a fixed duration.p

Negative 104810 pI know this may seem like a vague question but I need some help from someone who knows about DES en c.p  pI have a project that does DES Encryption manually without the use of any builtin libraries from the .NET framework. This is very important so I dont need any recommendations like use this library of that extension p  pI have been following this example a hrefhttporlingrabbe.comdes.htm relnofollowThe DES Algorithm Illustrateda and everything works fine, after the 16 iterations I get the result as illustrated on that site.p  pI think the issue lays within my conversion from codeStringcode to codeListltBitArraygtcode because when following the example from the site I hardcoded the message and key value into a codeBitArraycode. Although when creating a new codeBitArraycode with a codebytecode as value it turns the values around meaning the most significant bit is on the left hand side but all my code is adjusted to that.p  pI know its a lot of code but keep in mind that this code does work if I use the hardcoded bits found on a hrefhttporlingrabbe.comdes.htm relnofollowthisa site.p  pHeres how I get the

But it doesnt affect the line spacing in that paragraph. Not that it should, but then p  pThe next two paragraphs have codelineheight 150code. Again, the second paragraph has one word thats smaller. But this time, for reasons unclear, the smaller font creates extra space between the first two lines at least in Safari, Chrome, Firefox and Explorer. This is the original problem in my CSS that I was trying to fix. I speculate that it has something to do with the browser shrinking the word and then shifting it downward vertically to realign the baselines.p  pThe next two paragraphs have codelineheight 1.5emcode. My understanding is that code1.5emcode is the same as code150code. And indeed, the behavior is the same extra space between the first two lines of the second paragraph.p  pstrongBut heres where it gets weirdstrong the next two paragraphs have codelineheight 1.5code  no unit specified. This time, the extraspace problem disappears.p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.com6bJu2.pngimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com6bJu2.png width124 height152ap  pIn sum, CSS seems to be giving consistent linespacing results when the line heights of the parent amp child are different through inheritance of the unitless value but inconsistent results when the line heights of the parent amp child are the same. p  pThus my questions p  ol lipI know theres an intentional semantic difference a hrefhttpwww.w3.orgTR2011PRCSS220110412visudet.htmlpropdeflineheightin the CSS speca between code1.5code and code150code or its synonym, code1.5emcode. Namely a unitless value is passed to the child element and its line height is calculated using the childs font size, whereas a percentage or em value will cause a line height to be calculated for the parent, and then that calculated value is passed to the child. But how does this account for the difference in behavior seen here Where is the extra space coming from If its a consequence of some CSS positioning rule, then what is that rulepli lipOr, if these examples should all render the same way, then which one is implemented incorrectly Note on Q2 The fact that the rendering quirk happens the same way across different browsers strongly suggests that none of them are implemented incorrectly, which will take you back to question 1.pli lipstrikeIn practical terms, is there a downside to switching to unitless measurements like code1.5code for codelineheightcodestrike Answer nopli ol

Negative 104810 pIn this case, interface means a class that has all pure virtual methods and no data members you know, the Java definition.p  pCurrently, I have several subsystems really just related classes in folders such as graphics, math, physics, input, etc. that also have related interfaces located in each folder.p  pAs a simple example, say I have two interfaces codeIDrawablecode denoting a class can be drawn and codeIBoundingBoxcode denoting an object is a bounding box used for a physics simulation.p  pLets say a concrete implementation of the bounding box interface can also be drawn for debugging purposes so it also inherits the codeIDrawablecode interface in addition to codeIBoundingBoxcode. This requires including a header from a folder that is in a completely different, and potentially unrelated, folder hierarchy.p  pShould I place all interface headers in their own folder Interfaces or leave them in their related but separate hierarchiesp
Negative 104810 pIm loading a large amount of files binary data into a Postgres database the files being stored as blobs in the db.p  pOne way I found was to use Large Objects, which works nicely. However, for various reasons I would like to explore the possibility of storing the file contents directly in a bytea field.  Now, the Large Object managers allows me to directly write chunks of bytes directly into its buffer, eliminating the need to first load the whole file into memory. p  pThis is rather important for me as im loading the files with several threads working in parallel and the GC just cant keep up if all threads are simultaneously loading whole files in to memory.  p  pIs there any way I could do this with a bytea parameter I was thinking of an SQL function which appends a chunk of bytes to the bytea field of a row. Then I can just call this function repeatedly for a blob. Im rather new to PostgreSQL so I really could do with a hint how such a SQL function could look like.p  pSo, how do I append to a bytea blob in PostgreSQL p  pBTW, alternative ideas are also appreciated.p  pIm using PostgreSQL 9.3, C .NET 4, and the NpgSql Postgres Data provider, the files blobs can be everything from a few kb to several mb.p  pEdit Ive seen references to a codebyteacatcode function, seems promising but I cant find an example on how I should use it.p  pEdit2 In the end it really seems to be easiest to just load the blobs as single parameters in a query... just as long as one makes sure that they are garbage collected fast enough e.g. not making the byte arrays a property of an object. Postgresql handles the data very nicelyp

Any idea where im going wrong Ive tried putting them the other way around, ive tried different ways of building array2 in the query, and nothing seems to help.p  precodeopenpositionsquery  SELECT position FROM shippositions WHERE shipid  shipid openpositionsresult  mysqliquerymysqli, openpositionsquery while openpositionsarray  mysqlifetchrowopenpositionsresult     array2[]  arrayopenpositionsarray   array1  arrayCO, XO, OPS, NAV, CTO, TAC, CMO, MED, CSO, SCI, CEO, ENG, CIV     arrayresult  arraydiffarray1, array2 codepre  pIve got it outputting elsewhere, and right now it just outputs array1 unchanged. If I put this in though, it outputs the correct difference.p  precodearray2  arrayCO, XO, OPS, NAV, CTO, TAC, CMO, SCI, CEO codepre

The problem I have is that even though Wildfly says it has deployed the war successfully sometimes not all the times when I try to access any URI of the web app I get 404 Not Found. The problem remains until I redeploy the web app. Emptying the tmp folder does not matterthe error might still be there after restart. p  pI turned debug on and the only thing out of the ordinary is Null ModelAndView returned to DispatcherServlet with name dispatcher assuming HandlerAdapter completed request handling after a request.

Negative 104810 pI have posted this question on Yii developers forum as well but didnt get any reply so far, so I thought it worth to try to post the quietsion here.p  pAfter reading several threads and blog posts Im still struggling with this issue. p  pIm in the middle of a project where my client asked me to prepare the application to be able to use editable grids. For this reason I included bootstrap and xeditable extensions. In order to create new record into the grid I use a button which calls a modal window into which I render my controllercreate action, where I use eselect2 dropdowns. p  pWhen I call my controllercreate action from the browser it works fine and generates all eselect2 dropdowns,however when I render it into a bootstrap modal window it generates simple html selects. p  pI read that thisis an existing issue with bootstarp and select2 and there are some workarounds but I couldnt make none of them working at all. p  pI recognized in the generated HTML that when view is rendered into the modal window the eselect2 script is not included into the HTML header. I added eselect2 script manually to the header but it didnt solve my issue. p  pCan someone helpme out on thisp  pPlease find herewith my codep  pstrongGenerate button in my admin view to create new itemstrongp  precodeltphp thisgtwidgetbootstrap.widgets.TbButton, array     labelgtj cikk rgztse,     typegtprimary,  null, primary, info, success, warning, danger or inverse     sizegtnormal,  null, large, small or mini     htmlOptionsgtarray         datatogglegtmodal,         datatargetgtmyModal,         hrefgtthisgtcreateUrlcikkcreate,     ,  gt codepre  pstrongGenerate modal in my admin viewstrongp  precodeltphp thisgtbeginWidgetbootstrap.widgets.TbModal, array                 idgtmyModal,                 options gt array                                 backdrop gt static,                                 keyboard gt true,          gt  ltdiv classmodalheadergt     lta classclose datadismissmodalgtamptimesltagt     lth4gtj cikk rgztselth4gt ltdivgt  ltdiv classmodalbodygt     ltphp echo thisgtrenderPartialform, arraymodelgtmodel,false, true gt ltdivgt  ltdiv classmodalfootergt     ltphp thisgtwidgetbootstrap.widgets.TbButton, array         typegtprimary,         labelgtAdatok rgztse,         urlgt,         htmlOptionsgtarrayonclick gt cikkform.submit,      gt     ltphp thisgtwidgetbootstrap.widgets.TbButton, array         labelgtMgsem,         urlgt,         htmlOptionsgtarraydatadismissgtmodal,      gt ltdivgt  ltphp thisgtendWidget gt  ltscript typetextjavascriptgt a[datatogglemodal].clickfunction     var target  this.attrdatatarget     var url  this.attrhref     ifurl         target.find.modalbody.loadurl       functionmyModal.draggable.resizable  ltscriptgt codepre  pstrongMy form view that is rendered into the modal windowstrongp  precodeltphp formthisgtbeginWidgetbootstrap.widgets.TbActiveForm, array         idgtcikkform,         typegthorizontal,          Please note When you enable ajax validation, make sure the corresponding          controller action is handling ajax validation correctly.

Negative 104810 pI work on a password manager application. I try to integrate it with Citrix systems. I would like to be able top  ul liautomatically log in to Citrix server from client machineli liretrieve the list of published applications from XenAppli liautomatically start published applicationli lisend application specific user and password information to published applicationli ul  pI have searched the web for some kind of APISDK for such tasks, but I have found nothing. For now the best option I can find is to use web browser automation to navigate Citrix Web interface, login automatically, retrieve published applications and start them. For sending user and password information to published application I can use Windows messages.p  pSuch solution is possible to implement, but doesnt seem very reliable. Different versions of Citrix have different web functionality. Even configuration changes can make a big difference. Additionally I have found that Citrix sites use a lot of different dynamic redirections internally, mainly Javascript, which makes things even more difficult.p  pI also tried ICA file generation, but it seems to require the information, which is not available to normal end user. The only information such user usually has is web interface address, login name and password.p  pIs there a better way of integrating with Citrix web interfacep

Negative 104810 pI have a HashMap that we use in our application. The data is populated from database during application initial load and then its always just read and never updated. There will be multiple threads constantly reading the data. Since the data is never updated, we currently dont use any synchronization and is using just the HashMap. The way we define this now isp  precodeprivate volatile MapltInteger, MyDatagt myMap  new HashMapltgt codepre  pNow we want to update this data in map once a day by repopulating from the database. What Im planning to do is get the data from database to a local map say codemyLocalMapcode say everyday at midnight. Once I have the data loaded from DB to codemyLocalMapcode I will just swap codemyMapcode to point to this.p  pSo my concern is, at the point where I do codemyMap  myLocalMapcode, is there a possibility that some other thread that is reading data from codemyMapcode get an empty or unexpected result If yes, I will have to synchronize codemyMapcode. For synchronization I have the below optionsp  precodesynchronizedmyMap  OR  synchronize all map get and update operations ConcurrentHashMap OR Collections.synchronizedMapmyMap codepre  pBut Im hesitant to use synchronization because then Im synchronizing all the reads too. I think synchronizing the map for once a day process of refreshing will impact all reads of the map that constantly occurs all through the day. This is especially bad since I have many maps in my application that are read and updated this way. Any thoughtcomments Thanksp

Negative 104810 pMy Windows Forms application has a large TabControl to select the view that the user wants to do customer management, other special list management, log list, etc.. Each tab page contains nothing special, its just a bunch of standard controls, layouted through TableLayoutPanels and FlowLayoutPanels. These are Labels, TextBoxes, ComboBoxes, ListBoxes and so on.p  pWhen I switch the tab page, I can literally watch Windows Forms painting the controls on the screen. In the first moment, the background of some controls seems to be partially painted, then other regions, then text, and a few rendering frames later everything is painted and complete.p  pThere is no event handler on the TabControl so nothing could delay the switching. The tab switching itself is quick, its just the rendering of stock controls that doesnt happen in one step but progressively. This is something that the user should not see. The controls themselves are also static. I dont rearrange or dynamically create them at runtime. There doesnt even have to be any content. I can already see this on a new tab page Ive just designed and that isnt filled with data yet. I have never seen such partial updates with WPF, its a WinForms issue.p  pWhat could be the cause of this behaviour and what can I do to fix it Is it possible at all to get atomic screen updates with Windows Formsp  pSometimes I could use SuspendLayout and ResumeLayout, but I dont perform any layout here, so theres no line of code that I could put those calls into. Its the default TabControl behaviour.p  pUsing VS 2010 with .NET 4.0, but this problem exists for years.p

The superclass is strongSketchPointstrong.p  precodepublic class SketchPointWriter  SketchPoint       public void writeXMLXmlWriter writer, string nameElement              writer.WriteStartElementnameElement         writer.WriteStringConvert.ToStringSketchPointthis.X  1000.0  ,          writer.WriteStringConvert.ToStringSketchPointthis.Y  1000.0  ,          writer.WriteStringConvert.ToStringSketchPointthis.Z  1000.0         writer.WriteEndElement       codepre  pstrongSketchPointstrong from the API does not have the ability to write itself to an XML file.  So, I want to add this functionality to the class by creating a subclass, inheriting all the superclasss properties and methods, and then add my new method.p  pPlease note the explicit type casting of strongthisstrong.  Without this type casting, Visual Studio is not aware that strong.Xstrong is a property of strongthisstrong.  In and of itself, I find this puzzling, so I resolved it with some heavy type casting.p  pEven with this type casting, it wont compile because Visual Studio throws errors because I have not explicitly created each and every method emExportHOE.SketchPointWriter does not implement interface member SldWorks.ISketchPoint.Typeemp  pThis creates a conundrum in my mind.  What is the point of inheritance if I need to rewrite all the methods  The API is not source code, it is a DLL  so I dont have access to the source.p  pSo, the question isp  ol liIs my code correct and the API is implemented in a way that doesnt really allow for inheritance of their own objects it is actually an interface that does not allow for inheritanceli liIs my code written poorly and rewriting the code will enable inheritance of properties and methodsli liIs it impossible to tell and therefore, I should really just give up and code another solutionli liIs there a clever workaround that is not as ideal as native C, but creates the same functionalityli ol

I have a large sparse matrix of values which needs to be included into a larger sparse matrix.

Negative 104810 pSo Im currently trying to implement an already existing application for payment processing via Braintree a hrefhttpsgithub.comTivixdjangobraintree relnofollowhttpsgithub.comTivixdjangobraintreea for reference. It seems like all the meat of this application is placed at the paymentsbilling directory but I cant seem to get into it to check it out. It seems like whats stopping me is a loginrequired decorator placed just before the view since whenever I access the directory it sends me back to the defined LOGINURL. However I have set up a login feature at the LOGINURL that authenticates the user and then sends them to paymentsbilling but it just redirects back again. Here is my codep  precodeusername  form.cleaneddata[username] password  form.cleaneddata[password]  user  authenticateusernameusername, passwordpassword if user is not None      Password verified for user     if user.isactive        return redirectself.successurl     else         return redirect else     return redirect codepre  pClearly the user is being authenticated and is active since it passes both tests when you try it, but it always just sends the user back to the LOGINURL rather than paymentsbilling. Anyone know whats the deal herep

Negative 104810 pHaving a sequence of n lt 106 integers, all not exceeding m lt 3106, Id like to count how many coprime pairs are in it. Two numbers are coprime if their greatest common divisor is 1.p  pIt can be done trivially in On2 log n, but this is obviously way to slow, as the limit suggests something closer to On log n. One thing than can be done quickly is factoring out all the numbers, and also throwing out multiple occurences of the same prime in each, but that doesnt lead to any significant improvement. I also thought of counting the opposite  pairs that have a common divisor. It could be done in groups  firstly counting all the pairs that their smallest common prime divisor is 2, then 3, 5, and etc., but it seems to me like an other dead end.p
Negative 104810 pIm looking for a solution to implement alpha masking with stencil buffer in libgdx with open gles 2.0.p  pI have managed to implement simple alpha masking with stencil buffer and shaders, where if alpha channel of fragment is greater then some specified value it gets discarted.

Thus, once the service is started, I want to block the thread that started it and then unblock it once the service has stopped running. The sample singleton structure given as an answer to me in an earlier thread seems promising, but I dont know how to implement the listener parts that are included. Instead, i tried to just set emsynchronizedem on a single variable, hence the parts of the SyncManager code that are not about listeners, but that does not work. Looking for more insight on how I might implement the singleton pattern to accomplish my goal of blocking the main thread while the http call is made by the intent service. p  pI realize some of my wording might seem overly repetitive, but im trying very hard to be specific bc of past downvoting. p

Negative 104810 pIf am not wrongp  pWhen producer publishes a persistent message on a topic then broker first store messages in persistent store let kahadb and then send an acknowledgment back to producer.p  pSo how will it work in case of Virtual Topic with a logical queue because message will be stored for queue as well in kahadbp  pAssume there is a durable subscriber on the topicp  pThanksp  pstrongEditstrong I will explain my use case.... A producer is publishing onto a topic and there are 5 subscribers, I want that out of these 5, first 3 get message normally and for remaining 2 only one of them get message, so I thought Virtual Topic can help in this and for those 2 subscribers I will make them listen to logical queue rather than topic... but I want to know what will happen to persistent message if broker crashesrestart in between....what will happen to persistent message that has been sent to broker...its possible that before replication to queues persistent store, broker stops. So is there any acknowledgement mechanism in place as in case of direct producer to broker.p

Negative 104810 pThis question is related to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions25918203markinguuidtypefielduniquecausesinvaliddataaccessresourceusageexceptiona question I had yesterdaya. They sound like different problems but I just figured out what I think is the core issue. I wasnt sure if redoing that last question is the best course of action here, so I just posted a separate question.p  pSo, back to the issue. I have the following domain classp  precodeclass Person       static constraints           key unique true           static mapping           key sqlType binary16           UUID key   codepre  pWhenever I try to call codefindByUserIdcode, I get the following exceptionp  precodeorg.springframework.dao.InvalidDataAccessResourceUsageException Cannot query [sample.Person] on nonexistent property key codepre  pSo it turns out, the reason Im having the issue that I described in the older question is that declaring the property unique implies that during validation, the GORM method codefindByUserIdcode gets called. I discovered this by trying to implement a custom validator that does something similar.p  pNow my question is, why is this happening, and what can I do about thisp  pWhen I use a UUID type identity property codeidcode I dont get any problems with GORM methods codegetidcode, or even codefindByIdidcode. For example if I have the domain class belowp  precodeclass Person       static mapping           id generator assigned, sqlType binary16           UUID id      Person          id  UUID.randomUUID        codepre  pThe following tests work just finep  precodegiven Person person  new Person person.save  expect Person.getperson.id Person.findByIdperson.id codepre

Negative 104810 pIm trying to wrap my head around inheritance and reusable widgets in AngualarJS to which Im completely new and would really like if someone can help out with pointers for my problemp  pI have a two page route app. Both these pages needs to be user configurable, both when it comes to which widgets to show and also more specifically for the tables widgets picking which columns of the data they hold should be shown.p  pWhat I do is that at page load I fetch a user specific JSON configuration from a REST API. This JSON will look something likep  precode   widgets [        typeTableWidget, columns[title, fromyear], dataSourceapimovies,       typeTableWidget, columns[name, country], dataSourceapiactors,       typeTableWidget, columns[name, age], dataSourceapiactors   ]  codepre  pThis means the user wants three tables displayed, two of which uses the same data source, except just showing different columns in reality this wont be the case but rather a graph or something else using the same data but displaying it differently. p  pNow, what Id like to do here is to create a generic TableWidget with the look and feel I want to the tables. It should be tied to a data source and some things should be configurable. In object hierarchy Id like to create some sort of BaseWidget type which has properties all my widgets will share. Id then want the TableWidget to inherit the common properties and also adds table specific properties.p  pThe flow I envision in the app is then basicallyp  ol liGet user configurationli liLoop through the configuration and instantiate each widget the user wants to seeli liPlace the widgets in the page draw themli ol  pThis obviously isnt using the directives since the html will not know about the user configuration. I cant know a load time what the page looks like and I dont know where the data will be fetched from. A kind of similar implementation is Kibana, but their code base is too massive for me to have the time to wrap my head around in time for me to solve my problem.p  pPointers to documentation and similar problems and solutions would be appreciated. I keep finding very simple tutorials and examples, and searching for architecture I only find posts about the recommended directory structure. p

Negative 104810 pI have a cocoa project on OSX. For that, I had to change the class of the Appdelegate. I did this in two steps First I implemented the new appdelegate class I didnt implement the codeNSApplicationDelegatecode protocol yet and checked if it worked and compiled. In the new class I already implemented the codeapplicationDidFinishLaunchingcode method. Everything was still finep  pAfter that I changed the protocol implementation. I removed the prorocol from the old Appdelegate and inserted it in the new one. Even after this step everything seemed to be fine The application compiled and worked as it should. But as I was somewhat sceptical, I inserted log statements in the new and the old class. p  pAfter inserting this, I had to see, that the application still used the old appdelegate  Obviously, there is something where the name of the old appdelegate is still known But where is that Or do I have to do something else to reach my goal Does anyone know what I have to dop

What Ive come across is that the Publish script is setting variables at the beginning such as DatabaseName refer to example above. When running in SCLCMD mode from the MS SQL Management Studio, the script will sometimes never return. If, however, I run the script NOT in SQLCMD mode, let it fail, and then rerun it in SQLCMD mode, it executes successfully.p  pThere is a bit of code that I notice returns an error unfortunately, I do not have the error message but I will update when I get the error again when the script fails to return whilerunning in SQLCMD modep  precodeIF EXISTS SELECT 1            FROM   [master].[dbo].[sysdatabases]            WHERE  [name]  NDatabaseName     BEGIN         ALTER DATABASE [DatabaseName]             SET READCOMMITTEDSNAPSHOT OFF     END codepre  pThe script is failing on the ALTER DATABASE [DatabaseName] command. I suspect that this is the same scenario being played out when running from the CMD line using SQLCMD.exe. I hope this helps but I will continue to find a solution and EDIT this post when I do.

Negative 104810 pFirst post on SO, but in fact a longtime user since Ive found everything I need here until now.p  pIm facing a tricky problem with XHR. I may say that Im kind of a newbie in JS, but I didnt expect this kind of thing and I cant get aroundp  pSo the thing is that Im retrieving a bunch of images on a distant server with a for loop. No problem with that, it works. But I want to give them an id to use them with their number after, so that I can use them in a canvas, and animate it. I dont know where is the problem but the incrementation of the id goes wrong. Here is my code p  precodeltbodygt  ltbutton onclickloadCanvas113gtClick hereltbuttongt ltcanvas idtargetedCanvas width768 height512gtltcanvasgt ltscriptgt     window.URL  window.URL  window.webkitURL              function loadImages          for id  0 id lt 114 id              var url  httpmyurl.comIMGid.JPG             var request  new XMLHttpRequest             request.openGET, url, true             request.responseType  blob             request.onload  functione                  ifthis.status  200                      var blob  this.response                      var img  document.createElementimg                     img.id  id                     img.onload  functione                          window.URL.revokeObjectURLimg.src                                          img.src  window.URL.createObjectURLblob                     img.width  0                     img.height  0                     document.body.appendChildimg                                                   request.sendnull                        function loadCanvasid          var canvas  document.getElementByIdtargetedCanvas         var context  canvas.getContext2d         var img  document.getElementByIdid         context.drawImageimg,0,0           loadImages  ltscriptgt ltbodygt codepre  pSo you see there is a button, when you click on it, it loads the image to the canvas to display it.

This is the thing I cant understand. I guess this is because XHR is asynchronous, or something like that This is where I am a real newbiep  pThen if anyone has a key, or knows something to get around and use the XHRloaded images in another way, Id be glad to read it  p  pThank you very much SO community p

Negative 104810 pAFAIK, codeIterator.mapcode is lazy while codeVector.mapcode is eager, basically because they are different types of monads.p  pI would like to know if there is any chance of having a codeEagerTrycode and codeLazyTrycode that behave just like a hrefhttpsgithub.comscalascalablob2.11.xsrclibraryscalautilTry.scalaL185 relnofollowthe current codeTrycodea, but with the latter codeLazyTrycode delaying the execution of the closure passed until the result is needed if it is needed.p  pPlease note that declaring stuff as codelazycode doesnt work quite well in Scala, in particular it works for a given scope. An alternative exists when passing parameters parameters by name. The question is how to achieve lazy behaviour when returning lazy values to an outer scope. codeOptioncode is basically a collection of length 0 or 1, this would be an equivalent case for lazy collections codeIteratorcode, codeSequencecode but limited to length 0 or 1 like codeOptioncode and codeEithercode. Im particularly interested in codeTrycode, i.e. using codeLazyTrycode exactly as codeTrycode would be used. I guess this should be analogous in other cases codeOptioncode and codeEithercode.p  pPlease note that we already have codeEagerTrycode, as the current standard codeTrycode is eager. Unfortunately, the class is sealed, therefore, to have eager and lazy versions of the same class we would need to define the three of them and implement two of them as opposed to defining and implementing one. The point is returning a codeTrycode without other software layers worrying about the time of execution of that code, i.e. abstraction.p

Negative 104810 pIm trying to program a simple parallel processing system which should generate N objects to put in a container in a multithreaded environment.p  pTo tell the threads when to stop generating the object I created a simple reverse counter that starts at N at run down at 0 with each thread decrementing it in parallel. The counter is supposed to be a uint64t and I wanted to try the atomic support of C11. The code looks like thisp  precodeClass member stdatomicltuintfast64tgt counter  Parallel function whilecounter gt 0  do something  codepre  pIt compiles correctly and executes but it enters an infinite loop because once the counter reaches 0, it is further decremented but it jumps back to the highest integer available thus never stopping.p  pChanging the type to int64 instead of uint64 solves the issue but I would like to understand why do I need this workaround at all.p  pMy working hypothesis at the moment is that the decrement is done anyway even when the condition is false so when the first thread check the counter at 0 it decrements it anyway and the operation subtraction operation doesnt really care about the encoding of the integers but performs a simple bitwise operation I forgot which one exactly but I remember additions and subtractions are done by simple bitwise xor and shifts which in the next iteration is interpreted as the max uint value. Do you think this explanation is reasonablep  pApart from switching from uint to int one option is to switch the operation from a decrement to an increment but can you think of a different algorithm to keep the decrement in this contextp  pstrongEdit1strongp  pAnother possible solution I thought of, even though not particularly elegant is, knowing how many threads are actually launched in parallel, to stop the counter at NThreads with a start value of TotNThreadsp  precodeIn calling function counter  TotNThreads  Parallel function whilecounter gt NThreads  do something  codepre

Negative 104810 pstrongThe Problemstrong p  pI need to create an application that allows admin users to create checklists. Each emchecklistem has many emitemsem. The user will be able to add and remove items from the checklist, as they so choose. Via a gem like Cocoon, since it handles nested resources so gracefully.p  pAn example form would look something like thisp  hr  pstrongCheckliststrongp  ol liItemli liItemli liItemli ol  p[Add Items ]p  hr  pOnce a form has been created, normal users would then be able to completefollow a checklist. Checked is goodtrue, Unchecked is badfalse.p  hr  pstrongAutomobilestrongp  ol liCheck Oil    [checkbox]li liCheck Tires  [checkbox]li liCheck Lights [checkbox]li ol  p[Submit]p  hr  pThis is the difficult part. One approach I have considered...p  pCreate a Record model, that belongs to the Checklist model,p  pemChecklistemp  precode   class Checklist lt ActiveRecordBase       hasmany records     end codepre  pemRecordemp  precodeclass Record lt ActiveRecordBase   belongsto checklist end codepre  pThen, serialize the results into a hash...p  precodeclass Record lt ActiveRecordBase   belongsto checklist    serialize listhistory, Hash end codepre  pI would use the item.id as the key, and the user truefalse input as the value. So, the stored result would look something likep  precode[ 2 gt true, 54 gt true, 34 gt false] codepre  pThis way, users could complete a checklist many times, and then an admin could pull up the results of previous checklists. p  pstrongIssue Astrongp  pThis seems like it could work, except for when admin users want to edit a checklist. If they remove an item from the checklist, even though I can remove the item from the association, the item, must be kept in the database. Otherwise, if Oil has an ID of 2, and Oil is removed in an Edit, then the records listhistory hash will have [ 2  true], which is a key that points to nowhere. I can visualize a backlog of items pilling up.p  pstrongIssue Bstrongp  pIm not sure if this is the best way to tackle this problem. Ive been using rails for 2 12 years now, and still feel like I did on day 1. Actually, I  I feel as though I know even less. Maybe there is a better solution just around the corner, that I havent thought of yet. p

Negative 104810 pIm working on a semiprofessional project and needed a custom view for one of my models. As far as I could figure out that meant creating a UserControlinherited class, like sop  precodepublic partial class PopulationView  UserControl      ...  codepre  pNow this works wonders, and Ive been able to do pretty much all I wanted, including custom painting with onPaint but Ive noticed none of the events seem to be registering. Ive had to attach multiple event listeners and in all instances I end up going back to my form and adding an event listener to my custom components instance in the form. For example, Id like to add a Click event listener. What I try first is simplyp  precodepublic partial class PopulationView  UserControl      private void PopulationViewClickobject sender, EventArgs e              Debugger.Break       codepre  pof course attaching the function to the Click event through strongPopulationView.cs [Design]strong. That doesnt work so I end up adding a Click event listener on the instance of the component and adding the codePopulationViewClickcode function to my form strongMainForm.cs [Design]strong instead and launching the appropriate function on the control.p  pI feel that Im missing something very simple which is preventing me from being able to register events in my control directly and Id appreciate any help with this. I dug around the interwebs but couldnt find anything relevant.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pSome of the comment make me think I should provide more detailed information about what Im doing. The setup is sort of complicated but heres a summaryp  pI have a custom control inheriting from UserControl, called PopulationViewp  pI have an instance of that control added to a formp  pAttaching event listeners through the design view of the form to the instance of the control listener in form itself works. Adding them through PopulationViews design view listener in PopulationView does not.p  pWhat complicates thing is I have a BackgroundWorker in my form which is in charge of generating the PopulationModel for the PopulationView. Once that BackgroundWorker is done, it uses a BeginInvoke to tell the PopulationView its time to draw.p  pHowever, all events behave the way described even before the BackgroundWorker is triggered with RunWorkerAsync. Is it possible its still interferingp

My app shows an installation page on first run from which I build a connection string for other purposes but would also like to save that same connection string to the NLog.config file. After much searching it would appear that NLog can be changed programatically, but for whatever reason cannot save the changes back to the .config file. Therefore, my plan was to simply do the followingp  pstrongWHAT I HAVE TRIEDstrongp  ol lipChange the connectionString attribute to simply be connectionStringName instead.

I created a square with the rectangle tool, but I recently decided that it would look better if it was more oldschool, so i created a 8x8px image in Adobe Photoshop. I imported that to Flash and converted it to a symbol. Then I added it to the stage, added an Adjust Colorfilter, and then I was able to change the color of the image using those filteradjustments.p  pI want to be able to change the color of the boxes in AS3. I see that I can create several layers with different colors and etc., but I want to do that using AS3. I am planning to use the box as the playercharacter, so I want to make it easy to change the color from for example green to blue, and blue to red for different skins. Any suggestions p

After the malloc statement is executed, the program break is changed to a048000. It shows that, before calling malloc, the heap does not have enough memory. So, only the program break is changed after calling malloc. At initial state, if the heap had the enough memory, there is no need to change the program break. So at first, the size of heap is zero.

When I move my mouse a lot during startup, do I cause a hardware interrupt with every movement that makes the cpu save the current state of the eclipse loading process, recalculates the mouse position and so on and then restore the loading process So every movement causes the cpu to save the current stack and registers and so on and then later restore itp
Negative 104810 pMy question is a bit tricky and couldnt find the right manner in which to efficiently articulate it. Im creating a unique activation stringlink that combines a hashed username and time in PHP. However the exact time it gets the data to be sent to my database and the actual time it takes to send the email activation link  to the users email account is different maybe in milliseconds and sometimes secondsand this basically means I have different email activation Links from my database and email account.

Negative 104810 pIm still relatively new to iOS development and was wondering about whether or not its a good practice to do that.p  pFor example, lets say I have two different contexts in which I want to present identicalsimilar data in identicalsimilar ways, but there are some differences, maybe some different buttons from one context to another or different things I need to do to prepare the data. Should I just make multiple configuration methods in the same view controller and call whichever one as needed, or have two separate view controllersp  pIm heavily leaning toward the former being correct since it seems a lot more efficient and saves a lot of identical code, but Id like some input from more experienced programmers just in case.p
Negative 104810 pA transactional method in an EJB using CMT p  precodepublic boolean deleteEntity entity      Entity managedEntity  entityManager.getReferenceEntity.class, entity.getId     entityManager.removemanagedEntity     return entityManager.containsmanagedEntity  codepre  pSuppose that the specified entity has just been removed from the database. The client somehow happens to send the same detached entity once again in the next call to the codedeletecode method. As such, the codegetReferencecode method should throw the codejavax.persistence.EntityNotFoundExceptioncode. This however, does not happen, since the codegetReferencecode method returns an uninitialized lazy proxy. The proxy instance will be returned as long as the proxy is available. A codeDELETEcode DML statement is issued unnecessarily and the client is notified wrongly by returning a true boolean value which is undesired for user experience.p  pThis should not happen. In the next call to codedeletecode, the codejavax.persistence.EntityNotFoundExceptioncode should be thrown, be adequately handled and the client should be warned against the nonexistence of the entity.p  pI see the only way to do so is to use the codefindcode method but it is unnecessary in this case because there is no need to access or modify the entitys state  loading entitys state from the database is not required. What is the way, only using the codefindcode methodp

HOWEVER After using codecomponentWillReceivePropscode, now codethis.props.datacode is seemingly ALWAYS correctly attached to the props of codeChildElement1code which means codecomponentWillReceivePropscode doesnt run.p  pMy final solution was to use BOTH codecomponentWillMountcode and codecomponentWillReceivePropscode to account for both situations and to do the exact same check in both locations. This fix works, but boy does it seem messy and probably indicates a lack of understanding of component lifecycles, how the meteorreact should properly interact, both, or something else completely.p  pId sure appreciate a bit of help here.p  pedit Ive come up with a small improvement  instead of using codecomponentWillMountcode and codecomponentWillReceivePropscode to do the check to see if there are specific values defined in the Mongo Collection, I put that logic in coderendercode like sop  precoderender      let data  this.props.data,         values  data  data.specificValues  this.state.values      return ltspangtvalues[0] values[1] values[2] values[3]ltspangt  codepre  pTheres definitely still some sort of underlying issue, however, as I still dont understand why codethis.propscode is so inconsistent when given data retrieved from codegetMeteorDatacode.

Negative 104810 pIn JDeveloper 12c, I have created a BPM applicationproject. Project SOA Settings are codeComposite With Business Rulecode.p  pThe project has a Mediator and is exposed as a REST service. I am deploying using the codeIntegratedWebLogicServercodep  pThe XML Facts are rather generic including lists of fields, sublists, and subsublists, etc. This makes navigating the inputs more challenging.p  pI created a Java class with some static methods that more easily retrieve the data based on an expression. I created a jar with that class and then imported the class into the Java Facts. I then created rules that call the static methods on that Java Fact.p  pThe rules validate just fine and I can now successfully run the rules from the Test tab of the rules. I get expected results. However, when I deploy the project it seems like the imported jar is not deployed along with it since I get the following exceptionp  precodeoracle.rules.rl.exceptions.UndefinedException The symbol mypackage.MyUtil is undefined. at line 22 column 14 in Rulesetmain codepre  pI thought that importing the class in the Java Facts would cause my custom jar or at least the class that I imported to be deployed. But it seems that this may not be the case. Am I missing something Is there somewhere in my project that I can place the jar to cause it to be deployedp  pI tried adding the jar to the Libraries and Classpath entries of the project. I also tried adding it to a user library located in the project and adding that to the Libraries and Classpath list. But both had no effect.p  pI am new to JDeveloper and Oracle BPM, so Im hoping theres something simple Im missing here.p

Negative 104810 pSo I have a postview that I cant get to work properly, and flexbox seemed like the answer from heaven that I was looking for. Except, I cant seem to figure it out properly no matter what... p  pIf you look at a hrefhttpwww.cssdesk.comA7RFZ relnofollowthisa code, theres two vertical divs that should both stretch as more content gets added to either. The div where more content appears grows accordingly, but I want the other div to match in length, and so the bottom edges to be aligned to the bottom of the flex box. The repeating images behind the two founder buttons and the LOTS OF TEXT should then fill up empty space down to the bottom where the bottomedge images are.p  pIve been at this for a good week now and cant figure it out... Im sorry if this is a really simple thing or Im being dense about css, Im still learning. Any help would be greatly appreciated.p
