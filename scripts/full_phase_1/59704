Positive 59704 pI am trying to make a sprite as a frog which will come from the top of the screen and will go downwards to the bottom at y axis 0.Its working fine as a normal CCMoveTo but i want that after a jump the frog should rest for 1 second then again jump.Some kind of delay in moving.Can anyone tell me with this.I am attaching my code also. my frog animations are from fly1.png to fly5.png.I just want a delay after each move or we can say that I just want to call the CCMove after 1 second delay each time until the frog reaches the y axis0 Any help will be appreciated.Thanksp  precodeinclude HelloWorldScene.h include SimpleAudioEngine.h using namespace cocos2d using namespace CocosDenshion  CCScene HelloWorldscene   CCScene scene  CCScenecreate  HelloWorld layer  HelloWorldcreate  scenegtaddChildlayer  return scene    bool HelloWorldinit   if  CCLayerinit       return false  CCSize winSizeCCDirectorsharedDirectorgtgetWinSize  bgNode  CCNodecreate bgNodegtsetPositionccpwinSize.width2, winSize.height2 thisgtaddChildbgNode, 1  bgSprite  CCSpritecreatebg2.jpg bgNodegtaddChildbgSprite  float rX  winSize.widthbgSpritegtgetContentSize.width float rY  winSize.heightbgSpritegtgetContentSize.height  bgNodegtsetScaleXrX bgNodegtsetScaleYrY  zCCSpritecreatefly1.png zgtsetScaleXrX zgtsetScaleYrY zgtsetPositionccpwinSize.width2,winSize.height1 thisgtaddChildz CCAction aCCRepeatForevercreateHelloWorldgetAnimationWithFrames1,5 zgtrunActiona  zgtrunActionCCSequencecreateCCMoveTocreate2.0, ccpwinSize.width2, 0, CCCallFuncNcreatethis, callfuncNselectorHelloWorldsetInvisible, NULL  return true   cocos2dCCAnimate HelloWorldgetAnimationWithFramesint from, int to  CCArray frames  CCArraycreate   for int i  from i lt to i      CCString str  CCStringcreateWithFormatfly2d.png, i     CCSpriteFrame f  CCSpriteFramecreatestrgtgetCString, CCRect0,0,256,400     framesgtaddObjectf  frames,speedofmovementofanimation CCAnimation animation  CCAnimationcreateWithSpriteFramesframes,0.15f  CCAnimate a  CCAnimatecreateanimation return a   void HelloWorldsetInvisible  thisgtremoveChildz,true  codepre

Positive 59704 pI found a problem with my build, looks like Xcode5 changed this in comparing to Xcode4.p  pbefore, in Xcode4 I choose to build universal app and my app with iPhone size is scaled on iPad, can be found both in iPhone and iPad store.p  pnow, in Xcode5 if I choose universal, my app with iPhone size is no longer scaled on iPad, but keeps the original size while leaving the whole right part empty. If I choose iPhone, it is scaled on iPad, but can no longer be found in iPad store.p  pI noticed UIDeviceFamily is removed from Info.plist in Xcode5p  pwhat I want is simply the same build result with Xcode5 for my app as with Xcode4.

Positive 59704 pI have an ios6.1 app that will soon be updated to ios7 theres a bottleneck for resources in marketing right now but for the time being I need to make this app available on our enterprise account. Were not using the app store so apple standards are irrelevant.  When I download the app on my iPhone 5s it looks terrible.  Ive set the deployment target and base sdk to 6.1 but it still doesnt look like it should.  Looks exactly right on my old iphone 4 running 6.1 that Im testing it on, but my 5s still insists on using 7.1 which jumbles up the app something fierce.  Ive seen this work before, any thoughts  Thank youp

Positive 59704 pI have made some changes in a Mac application which was already build in XCode 4.6. This application works perfectly when run through XCode. And also works perfectly when I run it in my system after making it .app extension by going through organizer  distribute  extract as application.

Positive 59704 pI have two projects. The first is a 3rd party static library, which contains a huge amount of source code 400 and takes a emlongem time to build but I never change anything in there. The second is the app that depends on the first project, which is very fast to build.p  pThe problem Im facing is, sometimes, maybe after header file changes, the incremental build doesnt pick up the change and thus I need to do a cleanbuild to make sure it builds correctly. But when I clean, it also cleans the 3rd party static library, which means a long waiting time. I would love to be able to only clean the second project so that I can have a clean build every time and very quickly.p  pRight now the 3rd party static library project is included in the app project in the Project Navigator.

Positive 59704 pIve never used Objective X, or Xcode, or developed any software for OS X, but Im trying to convert an HTML5 website into a standalone app to run on OS x, so I can get it running fullscreen, i.e. without the browser location bars and other chrome that I dont seem to be able to remove from Safari or Google Chrome.p  pAfter reading a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma8491261981959this answera about creating a native HTML5 app for OS X I tried following the steps in the a hrefhttpwww.lostdecadegames.comhowtoembedhtml5intoanativemacosxapp relnofollowlinked tutoriala on a machine running Mavericks 10.9.5 and Xcode 6.1.1, but none of the steps seem to make sense for Xcode 6.p  pFor example, step 4p  blockquote   pIn your Xcode window, under Overview  Groups amp Files, expand WebViewExample  Frameworks by clicking the arrow icon.p blockquote  pI dont see an Overview, but in the project navigator I added the WebKit.framework as a linked framework.p  pI dont see Resources either, which step 6 talks aboutp  blockquote   pOn the same level as Frameworks, expand Resources by clicking the arrow icon.p blockquote  pWhere do I put the resources i.e. the html files and images to open in the webviewp  pI tried copying the code from steps 10 and 11 into the relevant code.hcode and code.mcode files, but then for step 12 I dont know how to find an Interface Builder. p  pIs it even possible to follow these steps on Xcode 6p  pI tried building the project with what Id managed so far, and get the error described at a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq8368157981959Existing ivar 39title39 for unsafeunretained property 39title39 must be unsafeunretaineda for the codewindowcode variable.p  pI fixed the error by just letting the compiler generate the ivar or I think thats what I did I have never used ObjC, but I removed the body of the interface in the code.hcode header.p  pThat ran, but opened a blank window, presumably because I hadnt created any resources folder so there was no HTML file at this locationp  precodeNSString htmlPath  [resourcesPath stringByAppendingStringhtdocsindex.html] codepre  pId love to put the files there, but I dont know where the coderesourcesPathcode is meant to be for this projectp  pI tried adding my HTML files to the project, at the top level since I dont have a Resources folder, but that didnt change anything.p  pAfter giving up trying to create the app from scratch I downloaded the project from a hrefhttpsgithub.comlostdecadewebviewexample relnofollowGitHuba and tried to open the .xcodeproj file, but in the project navigator the project says 1 target, missing base SDK.

Positive 59704 pSo I started to create my game app and I have run into a problem. I am new to coding and so I am having trouble with the intro to my app. When the app loads it fades in the title and imageview at the top of the screen, so essentially when the screen loads up an imageview and a textbox fade in at the same time 2 seconds after the screen loads. The problem I have is that I also have a Play Now button that fades in after 3 seconds. I need this Play Now button, when clicked, to make that imageview and textbox to fade back out so I can begin the actual game part. And of course the Play Now button will need to fade when clicked as well. How do I connect the button with the two faded in objectsp

Negative 59704 pWPF XAML, I have a custom control I have written that wraps lookups. In typical government fashion, they have a lookup table for all possible lookups. My custom control will throw a popup overlay asking them to select from the items in the list. My problems relate specifically to databinding from my calling form to my control property to my underlying control VM.p  pIm calling the control like thisp  precodeltControlsLookupSelector SelectedLookupValueIdBinding PathDataContext.SelectedHarvestMethod, ElementNameSurveyFormWindow, ModeTwoWay gt codepre  pother spam was removed In this case, the explicit DataContext is required because the actual datacontext of the control is its own view model. SelectedHarvestMethod is a property on the form ViewModel. p  pIt works in New Form mode where the control is responsible for setting its own value the control includes a button that when you click it, gives you a popup, and you select which value of lookup data you want. That works fine as I said, it even binds back to the SelectedHarvestMethod in the code above. I can use this fine and be confident that my ViewModel always has the selected id assigned to that property.p  pBut now I am doing the Edit Existing Form mode where Im loading data back from database and setting the properties in the view model. So I set the SelectedHarvestMethod and that code works fine breakpoint hit in setter but the resulting setter on SelectedLookupValueId is not called  the value never goes through.p  pSelectedLookupValueId is a DP on the controls view modelp  precodepublic static readonly DependencyProperty SelectedLookupValueIdProperty        DependencyProperty.RegisterSelectedLookupValueId, typeofint, typeofLookupSelector, new UIPropertyMetadata0      public int SelectedLookupValueId                get  return int GetValueSelectedLookupValueIdProperty            set  SetValueSelectedLookupValueIdProperty, value ViewModel.SetPreSelectedLookupValueIdvalue        codepre  pTheres no errors in the output window or event log or written on the bottom of my shoe. Debug converter inserted shows that the integer value is definately assigned. As mentioned in comment, the VM implements INotifyPropertyChanged of course, and is raising the event correctly. p  pAlso, the actual type is User Control, not custom control it has XAML involved. p  pWhy isnt the property setter for my control being calledp

Negative 59704 pId like to send emails from a table every night at midnight, so Ive created a model to track all communications to be sent.  This codeCommunicationcode model stores who the letter is to, from, and the contents of the letter to be sent as html.  The user enters a criteria to match for whom the letter is intended state, country, favorite color, and so which returns a list of acceptable matches.p  pThis list of acceptable matches is iterated across and a new Communication is generated for each.  How do I render the contents of a partial view to a string to store in the database for delivery at midnight.p  precodecommunication  Communication.newparams[communication] communication.body  Render Partial with local variables to string here codepre  hr  pstrongJanuary 8, 2010strong Ive implemented the solution proposed by neutrino, and my code looks like thisp  precodecommunication.messagebody  rendertostring   partial gt letterssmallletter,    locals gt  quote gt quote codepre  pThe drawback to this approach is that it requires a context so it must be rendered within a controller, this rules out generating the email using a rake file.  As others have pointed out the approach of using a Communication model may introduce some unnecessary complexity.  At this time since the conditions I use to generate the list of recipients is never stored Ive opted to continue to use a communication model.p

Negative 59704 pIm thinking of a architectural way of displaying messages in our application FlexAsp.NETSqlServer, mostly messages that announce for instance a downtime.p  pCurrently I was thinking of creating a table FlexMessage that holds the name of a message based on that name I now where to put in Flex and the value the message itself. As a result however, someone will have to create these messages and also delete them when they are no longer valid. So, thinking further, I thought of creating messages having a startdate and enddate, so an interval in which they need to be displayed. Like this, someone could login to the management part and create a message that needs to be displayed from a certain date until a certain date.p  pI could also hardcode it in the Flex Application, but that would mean putting a new build online of the swf each time something changes with a certain message. No good idea I guess.p  pIs there a better way for this that I havent thought aboutp

Negative 59704 pIm trying to listen to a live audio stream on a webpage with a latency of less than 3 seconds. So far with ogg vorbis streams generated using ices amp icecast, Ive been unable to get latencies less than 7 seconds. All players Ive used so far html5 audio tag in Firefox, Opera, Safari VLC as well seem to introduce similar delays. Its unclear at this point how much latency is introduced in icesicecast vs. the clientside player.  Ive tweaked ices and icecast settings, to no avail.p  pHas anyone achieved better latencies than this in a similar icesicecast setup  I wouldnt expect an ogg vorbis decoder be it html 5 in a browser, VLC, or whatever to delay an audio stream for multiple seconds. Am I incorrect  I cant find any info on controlling buffer sizes or the decoding in browsers.p  pWith a different architecture html 5, firefox, WSGI server serving wav format audio, I was able to achieve latencies around 12 seconds.  By default, the firefox began playing the wav file 5 seconds behind, but I could advance playback by setting audio.currentTime ahead, and only be 12 seconds back somewhat fragile.  However, Id much prefer to use icecast, and streaming wavs obviously doesnt scale.p  pThanks in advance for any ideas.p

Negative 59704 pI have made an openGL camera class that uses lazy evaluation to provide the final projection or modelviewprojection matrices through getter functions.  The user provides the various camera parameters throughout the life of the instance FOV, position, etc. , but rather than have the projection matrix andor MVP matrix recalculated every time a parameter is changed, a changed flag is set i.e. the old cached matrix is now invalid.  Whenever the user then requests the updated final matrix, it is recalculated, the result cached, and a const reference returned.p  pEverything sounds fine until I call myp  precodeconst QMatrix4x4amp oEGLCameragetModelViewProjection const codepre  pfunction from a const oEGLCamera instance...  I use const references everywhere in my app to extract camera data from CAD viewports without changing the camera, but my getter function performs lazy evaluation on member variables if they are invalid  therefore breaking constcorrectness.p  pIs there a language feature or design paradigm Im unaware of to help with this  Or is lazy evaluation fundamentally incompatible with constcorrectness  I am aware of constcastlt, I have never used it myself but have a read few things about it which boil down to If you have you use it, you have already gone wrong somewhere.

Negative 59704 pI cant think of a better way to word the title, sorry.p  pIm working on a PHP IRC bot. Currently Im using a codewhile fgets...code loop to keep it listening for data and responding.p  pAt some point while I was asleep, it actually pinged out and stopped getting data, without any sort of error message that I could use to trigger a restart.p  pI thought of a quick solution, and thats to store the last time the server pinged the bot, and if its more than x seconds, reconnect. This plan works great in theory, except that this ping check is done inside the while fgets loop, so it only checks it when it receives data from the IRC server. As such, if it just stops getting data from the server, it wont compare the ping times, and wont restart.p  pI cant think of how to get around this. Helpp

I working on a php socket daemon which works via localhost, but when I try to connect from outside the LAN or another PC, it doesnt work. Ive simplified my daemon to a very basic socket connection to replicate the issue for you to see.p  pBasically, heres the senario. I start the socket daemon on my server on port 6667. I can connect to the daemon via telnet and from the browser on the local machine running the daemon, but I cannot from any other machine  the daemon doesnt even see a connection attempt being made.p  pTo further complicate the issue which is why I think its a port forwarding issue, my ISP blocks port 80, so Ive setup dyndns and my router to use port 8000. Ive also setup my router to forward port 6667 to my server.p  pTo access my daemon from a browser, I enter the following seudo urlp  precodehttpmydomain.com8000client.php codepre  pThis works from the local machine and will connect, but from any other machine, the daemon doesnt even see a connection attempt being made. However, if I specify the port like thisp  precodehttpmydomain.com6667 codepre  pmy daemon does see a connection being made, but of course then the browser doesnt have a client page loaded that the user can use to interact with the daemon.p  pMy client uses a flash file to create the socket connection jsocket, but I know it isnt the crossdomain policy file because the policy is correct, and when connecting via localhost, it serves the policy file correctly.p  pHeres the simplified daemon codep  precode lt    set some variables  host  0.0.0.0  port  6667    dont timeout  settimelimit0    create socket  socket  socketcreateAFINET, SOCKSTREAM, 0 or dieCould not create socketn    bind socket to port  result  socketbindsocket, host, port or dieCould not bind to socketn    start listening for connections  result  socketlistensocket, 3 or dieCould not set up socket listenern    accept incoming connections   spawn another socket to handle communication  spawn  socketacceptsocket or dieCould not accept incoming connectionn    read client input  input  socketreadspawn, 1024 or dieCould not read inputn    clean up input string  input  triminput    echo input back  output  input . n  socketwritespawn, output, strlen output or dieCould not write outputn    close sockets  socketclosespawn  socketclosesocket  gt codepre  pSummaryp  pI CAN connect from localhost via telnet and browser... I CAN connect from other machines via telnet, but I CAN NOT connection from the browser from other machines using the ip or domain name when port 8000 is specified. The daemon doesnt see any connection attempt. If I specify port 6667, then the daemon sees a connection attempt, but that is useless to the user. p  pAny help in this matter would be greatly appreciated Thanksp

Negative 59704 pIm currently transfering a set of ASP classic pages over into our new MVC based intranet. While Im not making any sigificant functionality changes Im making some UI improvements and some more best practices. This is however throwing up problems with special characters. p  pOne section works by a drop down list of clinical tests which then GETS via the querystring on the name of the test. However ASP.nets HTMLEncoding is being overly aggressive despite being UTF8 its encoding a wide range of characters. This results in the HTML encoded character being URL encoded and the whole thing throwing a potentially dangerous request error.p  pI could not HTMLEncode the test names, the people with access to change this is quite limited, however that not a path I want to start going down.p  pThis leaves me with unencoding the string then reencoding it, but JavaScript doesnt have a native HTMLDecode function. Rather than getting a long list of characters and running a replace over the string I was wondering if there was an easy way to go from an HTMLencoded character straight to a percent encoded character, ie rather than decode and reencode something along the lines of xxx  xxx2p

When this is updated I have an event listener callp  precodeparticle.updateVelocitywhateverTheUserEntered codepre  pHowever I get the error particle has no method updateVelocity. After a bit of reading up on the subject I understand that to call that function I need to create an instance of the object, but this will only update the velocity value of that instance which isnt going to work for me.p  pMy question is, is there a way to achieve what Im doing or have I approached this in completely the wrong way As I said, Im still getting to grips with OOP principles so I may have just answered my own question...p

Negative 59704 pI have a .net assembly that exposes a public class named A to be created other programs using reflection Assembly.CreateInstance. For now, it works fine.p  pBut now I have two subclasses of A, say A1 and A2, and I need to create one or the other, depending on a runtime check. The client cannot be modified, it should believe that the object returned is of class A.p  pIf I were using COM instead of .net, it would be easy enough simply add the check into the IClassFactory.CreateInstance and be done. But is there a way to do this in .netp  pNote the obvious solution of using a proxy object, or similar, is not practical, because class A has several hundred methods  and I dont want to reroute all of them.p

Negative 59704 pUsing Qt 4.6.3, x64, linuxp  pIm testing how to properly insert widgets into a existing a codeQGridLayoutcode filled with various widgets.

Based on this knowledge, the following code produces the initial desired resultp  precodeglgtaddWidgetlabel glgtaddWidgetwedit,  0, 2  note specified column 2, columnCount is now 3 glgtaddWidgetxlabel, 0, 1, 1, 1 codepre  pThough this is not particularly useful, as the original layout in question isnt built with later layouts in mind.p  pSince addWidget allows for specifying cell position, as well as rowcolumn span, it seems odd that Qt wouldnt automatically replace the existing widgets in the layout. Does anyone have a suggestion as to how I might overcome this I assume it would be possible to recreate a QGridLayout and copy into it the children of the original, taking care to insert the additional widget in the right location. This however is ugly, and susceptible to Qt version issues as I want to modify a built in widget.p  pemEditemp  pI realize that Im making the assumption of thinking in a codeQHBoxLayoutcode way, where inserting a widget is uniquely understood, whereas in a codeQGridLayoutcode this isnt the case .p  pI can clarify that I ultimately would like to modify codeQFileDialoggetSaveFileNamecode, by inserting a widget similar to the widget shown above right above the two lower rows i.e. above File ampName.p  pThanksp

Negative 59704 pIve looked around a bit and I cant come up with an answer on how to effectively override the Control.Enabled in C WinForms 3.5. p  pOur situation is that we have a base form or master form that we use which adds a status bar at the bottom and toolbar at the top.

Negative 59704 pIve had this problem for a couple of days now, Ive googled a lot but found out nothing useful so I thought to ask here. Ive got a retention problem with an NSMutableArray, however I cant understand where the trouble is and how to fix it. I am drawing a a line chart using Quartz 2D, and in order to do so I have subclassed UIView with GraphView. The header looks like thisp  precodeinterface GraphView  UIView      NSMutableArray data    voiddrawBarCGRectrect contextCGContextRefctx  voiddrawLineGraphWithContextCGContextRefctx  voidaddValuefloatvalue  propertynonatomic, retain NSMutableArray data  end codepre  pI use the data array to store data points to draw, within the drawLineGraphWithContext method. The addValue method, on the other hand, is used in the main controller to fill in the  data array. In the viewDidLoad of the controller I do, to fill in the data arrayp  precodegraphView  [[GraphView alloc] init]  float data[]  0.7, 0.4, 0.9, 1.0, 0.2, 0.85, 0.11, 0.75, 0.53, 0.44, 0.88, 0.77, 0.99, 0.55  forint i  0 i lt 14 i      [graphView addValuedata[i]]  codepre  pEverything is good at this point, and in debug I can see the array is populated with all elements. The problem is when the drawLineGraphWithContext method is invoked for some reason, the array suddenly gets empty and its retain count is 0. I have tried changing the way I access the object, using dot notation or omitting the self, however the behaviour looks the same. Strangely enough, I have tried identifying zombies with both GDB and Instruments, however none seems to be found. As a matter of fact, then the main loop within the drawLineGraphWithContext below is started the data array has zero elements, and nothing is drawn. Below complete files I am omitting irrelevant parts.p  pI am using Xcode 4.2 with Automatic Reference Counting.p  pThanks in advance to anyone helpingp  pGraphView.hp  precodeinterface GraphView  UIView      NSMutableArray data    voiddrawBarCGRectrect contextCGContextRefctx  voiddrawLineGraphWithContextCGContextRefctx  voidaddValuefloatvalue  propertynonatomic, retain NSMutableArray data  end codepre  pGraphView.mp  precodeimport GraphView.h  implementation GraphView synthesize data   id init      self  [super init]     ifself          data  [NSMutableArray array]         NSLogs, FUNCTION          return self    voidaddValuefloatvalue      NSMutableArray tempArr  [self data]     NSNumber val  [NSNumber numberWithFloatvalue]     [tempArr addObjectval]     [self setDatatempArr]    voiddrawLineGraphWithContextCGContextRefctx      CGContextSetLineWidthctx, 2.0     CGContextSetStrokeColorWithColorctx, [[UIColor colorWithRed1.0 green0.5 blue0 alpha1] CGColor]      int maxGraphHeight  kGraphHeight  kOffsetY      CGContextBeginPathctx      CGContextMoveToPointctx, kOffsetX, kGraphHeight  maxGraphHeight  [[[self data] objectAtIndex0] floatValue]      int i  0     NSMutableArray arr  [self data]      forNSNumber elem in arr              float val  [elem floatValue]         CGContextAddLineToPointctx, kOffsetX  i  kStepX, kGraphHeight  maxGraphHeight  val        i           CGContextDrawPathctx, kCGPathStroke         voiddrawRectCGRectrect      CGContextRef context  UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext      CGContextSetLineWidthcontext, 0.6     CGContextSetStrokeColorWithColorcontext, [[UIColor lightGrayColor] CGColor]      CGFloat dash[]  2.0, 2.0     CGContextSetLineDashcontext, 0.0, dash, 2      int lines  kDefaultGraphWidth  kOffsetXkStepX     forint i  0 i lt lines i              CGContextMoveToPointcontext, kOffsetX  i  kStepX, kGraphTop         CGContextAddLineToPointcontext, kOffsetX  i  kStepX, kGraphBottom           int horizontalLines  kDefaultGraphWidthkOffsetYkStepY     forint i  0 i lt horizontalLines i              CGContextMoveToPointcontext, kOffsetX, kGraphBottom  kOffsetY  i  kStepY         CGContextAddLineToPointcontext, kDefaultGraphWidth, kGraphBottom  kOffsetY i  kStepY          CGContextStrokePathcontext     CGContextSetLineDashcontext, 0, NULL, 0      [self drawLineGraphWithContextcontext]   end codepre  pGRViewController.mp  precodeimport GRViewController.h  implementation GRViewController synthesize scroller synthesize graphView  pragma mark  View lifecycle   voidviewDidLoad      [super viewDidLoad] scroller.contentSize  CGSizeMakekDefaultGraphWidth, kGraphHeight     graphView  [[GraphView alloc] init]      float data[]  0.7, 0.4, 0.9, 1.0, 0.2, 0.85, 0.11, 0.75, 0.53, 0.44, 0.88, 0.77, 0.99, 0.55      forint i  0 i lt 14 i              [graphView addValuedata[i]]       codepre  pendp  pGRViewController.hp  precodeimport ltUIKitUIKit.hgt import GraphView.h  interface GRViewController  UIViewController property retain, nonatomic IBOutlet UIScrollView scroller property retain, nonatomic IBOutlet GraphView graphView  end codepre

Negative 59704 pMy question is why does a dev site work when the project is run in Visual Studio 2010, but not when served from IIS on the same PCp  pI am trying to set up a dev copy of a clients site. On startup, the site makes a connection to a remote database server. The connection uses WCF and a SSL certificate to secure it. When I installed the site on my PC, following instructions, I installed a Cert Chain into the Trusted Root Certification Authorities and added registry keys and host entries to resolve connections to the remote service.p  pWhen I open the solution in Visual Studio 2010 on my PC and run it in the builtin ASP.NET dev server, it works  my workstation connects to the remote service via SSL on a custom port 444 and the dev site queries for data successfully from the service. All of this is handled by a DLL provided with the project, and is outside my scope of work. I was briefed up front that the connection was very finicky about the SSL cert, system clock time agreement between the two machines, etc. and it took me a few tries to get it to work.p  pHowever, when I run the site in my local IIS Windows 7, IIS 7.5 the site cannot connect to the remote service the service wont accept the SSL connection. The startup code throws an exception when this happens, preventing the site from loading further.p  pEverything else seems to work fine the only wrinkle is that VS requires a 32bit version of the secure connection DLL while IIS on Windows 7 requires a 64bit version. Both were provided to me and I swap them as required.p

Negative 59704 pIve asked a very similar question before for a video renderer filter.p  pSee here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8164777customdirectshowvideorendererfilterdynamicresolutionchangeCustom DirectShow Video Renderer Filter  Dynamic Resolution Changeap  pBut this time, I need a solution for a source filter. This source filter connects directly to the video renderer. Decoder is embedded.p  pIm able to get the resolution changes from the stream. I also resize the buffers when I get a new resolution. But I dont know how to notify my new resolution through the pin. Should I somehow create an instance from codeCMediaTypecode, fill in the new values and call pins codeSetMediaTypecode method or what is the proper solution Im currently doing this.p  precodeifnWidth  nHeight  3  readergtmRGB24BufferSize   if resolution changed     readergtmRGB24BufferSize  nWidth  nHeight  3     readergtmRGB24Buffer  BYTEmallocreadergtmRGB24BufferSize      readergtmpingtmbmpInfo.biWidth  nWidth     readergtmpingtmbmpInfo.biHeight  nHeight     readergtmpingtmbmpInfo.biSizeImage  GetBitmapSizeampreadergtmpingtmbmpInfo       Now what How to notify the video renderer  codepre  pcodempincode is the only output pin of the source filter here which is declared likep  precodeclass MyPin  public CSourceStream  ...  codepre  pI know the answer should be simple and there should be many examples around but since Im a little bit confused about these subjects, I prefer a nice explanation besides the example.p

Negative 59704 pThis question has been asked before, but I would like a little more detail from this one, more about the audience and why.p  pI was never a Javascript fan, if I could avoid using it I would... but now jQuery has evolved, Ive found myself using a lot of it, and really enjoying it. But I now feel I could get carried away and use too much.p  p1 How many people actually have JS disabled Does anyone have precise visitor statisticsanalytics that proves what percentage of visitors are disabled If its only 1  5, should we really be caring about themp  p2 Whats the reason for disabling JS in the first place, seeming as its enabled by default on all browsers I dont understand why the browser gives us that option. Ive never found a reason to switch off my JS, unless its for testing purposes.p  p3 Do you think that JS will ever become a permanent browser language, by disallowing users to switch it off Websites would be amazing and secure if scripts were permanent.p  pM application, a secure login only site, is rich with AJAX, overlays, tooltips and elements fading in and out  so much that it wouldnt work without it. But this isnt a problem for me as my users are warned at the point of registration that JS is a 100 requirement and my particular visitors actually need my application. I also have a codeltnoscriptgtcode redirection back to the login page.p  pIm asking the above questions because Im about to redevelop the homepage to my application, which is public, but Im unsure about how much to use and how big the audience is that would miss out on the jQuery goodness.p  pThanksp

Negative 59704 pI am working with a Rails polymorphic inheritance configuration  I have the following setupp  precodeUser lt ActiveRecordBase belongsto rolable, polymorphic gt true  Student lt ActiveRecordBase hasone user, as gt rolable acceptsnestedattributesfor user  Teacher lt ActiveRecordBase hasone user, as gt rolable acceptsnestedattributesfor user codepre  pI want to be able to capture email address for teachers and a username for students who wont typically have an email address. I defined those as attributes of the User model, but now Im stuck when I try to do validations for Student and Teacher. I didnt define them in their respective models because Im using Devise and there will be other user types. Abstracting what is currently type to a Role pattern isnt a good fit for my particular scenario either.p  pSince username and email are properties of User what I basically want to do is check if the rolabletype field from the polymorphic relationship is type student and if so, make username required and email not, but in the new method that property isnt set. However Rails knows this is a Student, so it feels like theres some way to check the instance type. The closest link Ive found to what Im shooting for is the third comment to the accepted answer in this question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3218993howtoapplydifferentvalidationruleaccordingtopolymorphicassociationtypeHow to apply different validation rule according to polymorphic association type Railsa, but Im having trouble getting the methodmissing syntax correct as Im not experienced with metaprogramming.

Negative 59704 pIn my application, I first start an activity which starts a thread that reads updates from a website. If an update is available, I pop out an alert dialog. When the user presses OK to the dialog, a message is sent back to the server saying that the user received the updatep  pHowever, The user is able to go through multiple activities, so my question is, how can I still display that dialog at any activity the user is in whenever an update occurs I keep the update thread running until the user completely exits the app, which means I am not destroying the very first activity that starts the update thread.p
Negative 59704 pWe have an Entity framework 4.1 setup, auto generated POCOs and DbContext classes for interaction with the db.p  pThe automatically generated DbContext derived class looks like thisp  precode public MyEntities          basenameMyEntities           codepre  pAnd the automatically generated connection string in app.config something likep  precodeltconnectionStringsgt     ltadd nameMyEntities connectionStringblah blah blah  providerNameSystem.Data.EntityClient gt ltconnectionStringsgt codepre  pThats all fine, and works right out of the box.p  pEach of our developers has their own SQL Developer edition install for unit testing and dev purposes, so they need to modify the connection string to point to their installation when doing unit testing. These connection strings are in the App.config file of the unit test projectp  pThis is currently a manual modification step, and I had thought to automate this in some way.p  pNow, I can go and work out the connection string in code, but passing this into the entity framework constructor is prevented by the default autogenerated MyEntities constructor above  it doesnt have a connection string parameter on any constructor. Although DbContext does. Furthermore, I dont particularly want to plumb the connection string through the DAL code and down into the entity framework code  that isnt needed in production, so thats modifying my code just for the purposes of unit test.p  pI had thought there must be some way to override the string in App.config. This would be similar to how this can be done with a local Appsettings file.    codeie ltappSettings fileLocal.configgtcode, but I cant seem to see how to do this for the ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings entries.p  pSo, what does one do here p

Negative 59704 pOkay so I have followed a good tutorial regarding embedding videos via HTML5 video tag, which can be found a hrefhttpdeveloper.practicalecommerce.comarticles1878HovertoPlayEcommerceVideoswithHTML5CSSandJavaScript relnofollowherea.  Basically the idea is that on hover the video plays, on hover out it stops playing.  p  pWell, Ive been trying to include multiple videos on one page all the same video, mind you in hopes that I could create a sort of interactive multitiled board of sorts.  In other words, you hover over each video, it creates varying images based on where in each video you end up, etc.  p  pWhatever, the question I am asking is  based on this tutorial that Ive followed, what is the best way to create multiple, tiled videos  Ill paste the code Ive been working with.  The problem Im having is that if I create multiple javascript functions, it shows only the video of the last function Ive created, rather than all videos.  p  pI hope this makes sense. a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netymV8J10 relnofollowHerea is the link to what Ive been working on so far.  NOTE the video takes a while to load, so until then it will play the sound but no image.p  pThanks in advance for any helpp

Negative 59704 pI am trying to rotate a UserControl Image and programmatically adjust the speed of the rotation.p  pSo, first, I have defined a storyboard, which rotates a wheelp  precode ltStoryboard xNamewheelRotationgt             ltDoubleAnimation                 xNameleftRotation                 Storyboard.TargetNameleftWheel                 Storyboard.TargetPropertyleftWheel.RenderTransform.RotateTransform.Angle                 From360 To0 Duration002                 AutoReverseFalse                 RepeatBehaviorForevergt             ltDoubleAnimationgt ltStoryboardgt codepre  pNext, I am trying to update the Duration of the rotation programmatically, adjusting the speed every 2 secondsp  precodeleftRotation.Duration  speed1 codepre  pAt first sight, this seems to work, especially if the changes in speed are small. But if the speed increases, at every update the wheel seems to adjust its angle a little bit more, causing hiccups. if the speed increases, e.g. from 2s to 4s during a 2 minute period, the wheel seems to jump ahead for 12 degrees at the end, if it decreases in time, the wheel rotates back a little bit at every updatep  pI have also tried to implement the behavior using a fixed duration and update the SpeedRatio, but that didnt help either, those adjustments still occurred.p  pI am rather new to SilverlightWindows Phone, so I do not have a deeper understanding how it works internally, I would appreciate it, if someone could give me a hint how to solve it. Thanks...p

However, when  using XLC, the assembly generated is the followingp  precode... .L1 nop b mylabel ... codepre  pObviously, the program fails to compile because mylabel is never defined. The definition of mylabel is automatically translated to .L1 name. Actually this name depends on the number of local labels defined.

Negative 59704 pI know that usage of static variables on Android is quite risky, especially if you reference them to activities. However, if I have a class that extends Application lets call this class App, is it safe to reference to the instance of this classp  pIf so, is it also safe for any other class to have any kind of reference to the application context I mean, can there be a memory leak if I have a reference to the application context in any kind of classp  pThe purpose is that no matter in which scope I am in, I can always get a reference to the application context. I think its safe, since if the system closes the application, the static variable is also gone till the next time the application starts again, which will initialize the static variable again.p  pAlso, not that it matters much, but if I use multiple processes, will I get totally different references to App class on each processp  pAs an example of code, heres what Im thinking aboutp  precodepublic class App extends Application      private static Context appContext      Override     public void onCreate              super.onCreate         appContext  this           public static Context getAppContext              return appContext       codepre

Negative 59704 pMy question references an example from the a hrefhttpdownload.autodesk.comglobaldocsmayasdk2012enusindex.html relnofollowMaya C APIa and I am wondering if it is specific to Maya or a general C idiomp  pIn the Maya API, there is an object called codeMSelectionListcode, which is a container that represents objects in the scene. It also has a companion codeMItSelectionListcode which is an iterator for a codeMSelectionListcode instance.p  pNow I understand that the benefit of an iterator is for it to know how to loop over an object properly, but in this case the codeMSelectionListcode has a code.lengthcode method, as well as the same getters as the iterator, except you provide the index.p  pExample...p  pstronga hrefhttpdownload.autodesk.comglobaldocsmayasdk2012enuscpprefclassmselectionlist.html relnofollowMSelectionListastrongp  pre classlangc prettyprintoverridecodeMSelectionList activeList MGlobalactiveSelectionListactiveList  unsigned int length  activeList.length for unsigned int i0  i lt length i       MDagPath item     iter.getDagPathi, item  codepre  pstronga hrefhttpdownload.autodesk.comglobaldocsmayasdk2012enuscpprefclassmitselectionlist.html relnofollowMItSelectionListastrongp  pre classlangc prettyprintoverridecodeMSelectionList activeList MGlobalactiveSelectionListactiveList MItSelectionList iter activeList   for   iter.isDone iter.next       MDagPath item     iter.getDagPathitem  codepre  pThe only thing that the iterator provides over the normal selection object is the ability to set a filter type, so that it will only return objects matching a filter. Though you could perform this same test explicitly in the first example.p  pMy question is what would be the benefit of the iterator when there is overlap like this in functionality between the iterator and the original object Is this just a Mayaspecific design decision, or is it a general C idiom to always create iterators for some extra reason that I am not understanding here. p

Negative 59704 pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pIve had problems for quite a while now with players cheating in my android game. For a strict singleplayer game this wouldnt be a big issue, but since my game contains multiplayer battles and global highscore lists, its causing legit players to stop playing because of the cheaters.p  pstrongHow they cheatstrongp  pCheaters use an app for root users called a hrefhttpwww.cih.com.twgamecihGameciha. Gamecih lets users pause an app, change variable values, and then resume the app. So in my case they just pause the game, change health to 74 trillions and then kick the crap out of everyone on multiplayer. Heres a a hrefhttpwww.youtube.comwatchvg4kGyFboTMvideoa showing how Gamecih is used to cheat in Fruit Ninjanot my game.p  pstrongConsidered methodsstrongp  ol liCode obfuscation. This wont work because obfuscation doesnt change variable emvaluesem, just variable emnamesem. This means that cheaters can still find the variable that has the same value as their current health and then change that variable.li liCode obfuscation  getter amp setter value changing. This way, health will not actually represent the real health value. In the getter method I would do something like return health10 and in the setter I would do healthinput10 This could of course be more complicated.li ol  pstrongWhat I wantstrongp  pIt could be argued that considered method nr 2 is what I should use, but then again, it doesnt prevent hacking, it just makes it harder. Ideally, I would like to detect when people cheat using Gamecih, display a popup saying Darn you, you nasty hacker, and then close the application. I do emnotem want a serverdependent solution as I would like my players to be able to play while offline as well. If possible, I would also like to avoid code obfuscation.p

Negative 59704 pIm implementing a WPF application using the MVVM pattern.p  pThe application is basically a communications panel comms panel with control widgets laid on top of it e.g., dial pads, intercom lines, etc. The control widgets have also been implemented using the MVVM pattern, as this allows us to easily test them on an individual basis.p  pA few hours ago, I posted a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12952871bindingavariableinsideaviewmodeltoadifferentvariableinanotherviewmodherea because I was having problems in order to link things between a DialPad and CommsPanels viewmodels. After a long chat with another SO member, I managed to get the link working. However, in doing that, I made heavy modifications in the DialPad code, such as getting rid of its model and moving the viewmodel code to the codebehind file. The problem is, not my unit tests are not working, mainly because NUnit is throwing an exception everytime I tried to instantiate a DialPad codebehinds class, which inherits from UserControl. Is there any way to write unit tests for a class that inherits from a WPF class such as UserControlp  pThanks in advancep

When I try to put in a JFrame as a Jpanel or applet it wont repaint, it doesnt execute the stuff in init.

Negative 59704 pIm a selftaught programmer, and like many other noobs I once struggled with the classic passing data between forms problem. When I was building my first chat application in Java around a year ago, I came across this problem again. I solved it by passing a reference to the running GUI to the constructor of another class so it could directly manipulate the GUI. For examplep  precodeclass GUI      Writer w     void initGUI          w  new Writerthis        class Writer      GUI ui     public WriterGUI ui          this.ui  ui         ui.textBox.writeYo          now, instead of the this keyword, I can say ui.w or ui.w.ui.w.ui.w...       codepre  pI am certain that this is one of the most efficient ways to transfer data upstream, but I was given grief and some praise for suggesting this on a forum for someone having the same problem. So what kind of chaos could arise from doing this on larger applications When I look at my applications that use this, I notice that theyre very pragmatic and efficient, but also a bit too organic if you will and complicated especially when there are threads accessing the GUI at different times, etc.p  pIs there a better way of doing this I took a different approach out of necessity while using Qt, but it was more complicated since it used signals, slots, and threading. Please point me in the right direction. Thanks.p
Negative 59704 pThere is a strange change when saving JPEG image to the iOS photo library. I dont know if I am doing something wrong. Im using libjpegturbo to access JPEG images and then I modify DCT coefficients of the image. Modified image just in DCT, nothing else is saved in photo library. But after I open the saved image, DCT coefficients are not the same that I changed in the previous step.p  pIn detail, let me explain how Im adding 1 to each DCT. I am using standard procedure from example.c of the libjpeg libraryp  precodestruct jpegdecompressstruct cinfo struct myerrormgr jerr FILE  infile  if infile  fopenfilename, rb  NULL      fprintfstderr, cant open sn, filename     return 0   cinfo.err  jpegstderrorampjerr.pub jerr.pub.errorexit  myerrorexit  if setjmpjerr.setjmpbuffer      jpegdestroydecompressampcinfo     fcloseinfile     return 0   jpegcreatedecompressampcinfo  jpegstdiosrcampcinfo, infile  void jpegreadheaderampcinfo, TRUE  jvirtbarrayptr coeffsarray coeffsarray  jpegreadcoefficientsampcinfo  BOOL done  FALSE for int ci  0 ci lt 3 ci      JBLOCKARRAY bufferone     JCOEFPTR blockptrone     jpegcomponentinfo compptrone     compptrone  cinfo.compinfo  ci      for int by  0 by lt compptronegtheightinblocks by              bufferone  cinfo.memgtaccessvirtbarrayjcommonptrampcinfo, coeffsarray[ci], by, JDIMENSION1, FALSE          for int bx  0 bx lt compptronegtwidthinblocks bx                      blockptrone  bufferone[0][bx]              for int bi  0 bi lt 64 bi                              blockptrone[bi]                                                    writejpegoutput, ampcinfo, coeffsarray  saving modified JPEG to the output file  jpegdestroydecompressampcinfo fcloseinfile codepre  pAfter this I have a new JPEG image saved in the file, lets say new.jpg. Now I want to save this new.jpg to the photo library so I load the image byp  precodeimageToSave  [UIImage imageWithContentsOfFileoutputFile] codepre  pI also checked that the DCT coefficients remained changed. After I have the same image wuth my modified DCT checked then Im going to save itp  precodeUIImageWriteToSavedPhotosAlbumimageToSave, nil, nil, nil codepre  pImage new.jpg is saved in photo library now.p  pUntil now, everything works great, DCT coefficients works like it was meant with the libjpeg library. The change comes when I load the saved image again and look into DCT coefficients. I found out that DCTs are changed and I dont know why. Is there any optimization algorithm that iOS use when you want to save JPEG image Why are DCTs changed.p  pIm using the following procedure to read the saved imagep  precodeNSData jpegData  UIImageJPEGRepresentation[info objectForKeyUIImagePickerControllerOriginalImage], 1 [jpegData writeToFilefile atomicallyYES]  saved image is saved in file and I can use the procedure from above to check DCTs codepre  pFurthermore, this is an example of original DCTs, modified DCTs by adding 1 to all, and loaded DCTs after saving it to photo library for one 8x8 blockp  precodeOriginal DCTs 759 24 8 1 1 0 0 1  56 27 10 1 0 1 0 0  8 0 0 0 0 1 0 0  0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1  0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0  0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0   Modified DCTs by libjpeg 758 23 7 2 0 1 1 2  57 26 9 2 1 2 1 1  9 1 1 1 1 0 1 1  1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0  1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1  1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1  1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1   DCTs after saving JPEG to photo library 758 22 7 2 0 0 0 0  58 26 8 3 0 0 0 0  8 2 0 0 1 1 0 0  2 3 0 0 0 0 0 0  2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1  codepre  pAny help would be appreciated.

Negative 59704 pIn the past few months, while doing iOS development, I got really comfortable with using the so called a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiGrandCentralDispatch relnofollowGrand Central Dispatch technologya provided by default with ObjectiveC. With just a couple of simple calls, it allows me to do awesome things likep  precodedispatchasyncdispatchgetglobalqueueDISPATCHQUEUEPRIORITYBACKGROUND, 0,       Do stuff on the lowest priority queue here     dispatchasyncdispatchgetmainqueue,           Do stuff with the above results here back in main threadqueue       codepre  pI can basically fork off tasks on other threads of custom priority whenever I feel like it, and I can use the result in any way I want without having to put much effort into passing objects between threads, terminating threads, joining on then etc. According to Wikipedia, a more general name of that approach is the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiThreadpoolpattern relnofollowthread pool patterna.p  pI feel like, as far as achieving parallelism is concerned, this is easier than a lot of other solutions I have used in the past Im thinking pthreads, but theres something analogous in most languages. I guess that a big part of the ease of use comes from the fact that iOS apps OSX too never wrote one myself use runloops and task queues for each thread, thus making work separable into discrete units, not something you generally start with in a blank program skeleton in most languages. p  pThe question thus is, is there anything like GCD in other languages, or is it not a model popular outside of the Apple universe Im specifically interested in ClojureJVM, since it does add a bunch of parallelization abstraction that might perhaps be analogous, but Id love to know the same about other languages as well.p

Negative 59704 pShould the Access Modifier be Public or Private when we are implementing method that is for now not using by other classes in our team solution I believe that A public member says this member represents the key, documented functionality provided by this object.. We make private only implementation details methods and all methods that can be useful in future we should make public even for now there is no consumers of our methods in others classes. But my opponent says  that such methods should be private. How do you thinkp  pAdded Lets be more specific. For example there is a class SqlHelper. In it there is useful functionality for operation with the SQL Server.  In particular there is used connection to the SQL server. But not only in that class.p  pAnd for example I need to implement the public static HandleSqlExeption methodnow only for class SqlHelper  which will process SqlExeptions. But I want that in all classes where there is operations with SQL connection in exception handling will be used this method instead of it is simple, for example     catch Exception  MsgBox SqlError  as somewhere happens now. So i consider that public access modifier will say to other colleagues that they can use this method. And private will hide that method. And i will need ti change code and rebuid assembly if some one will ask to use tsuch method. Why There is only negatives. p

Negative 59704 pI read that timers on hidden tabs run with a resolution of 1 second. Thats realy a defect for me. With WebRTC browsers can build up a p2p network. For my application one of the peers functions as a server for the others. Now, if the peer whos the server hides his tab, all other clients suffer, because the server is running at 1 fps.p  pIn my case the application is a game, and so thats not acceptable.

Negative 59704 pI have a realtime OpenGL application rendering some objects with textures. I have build a function to make an internal screenshot of the rendered scene by rendering it to an DIB via PFDDRAWTOBITMAP and copy it to an image. It works quite well except for one kind of texture. These are JPGs with 24bpp so 8 Bit for every R,G,B. I can load them and they render correctly in realtime but not when rendered to the DIB. For other textures it works well.  I have the same behaviour when testing my application on virtual machine WinXP, no hardware acceleration. Here these specific textures are not even shown in realtime rendering. Without hardware acceleration I guess WinXP uses its own software implementation of OpenGL and falls back to OpenGL 1.1.  So are there any kinds of textures that cant be drawn without 3d hardware acceleration Or is there a common pitfallp

Negative 59704 pAfter watching this stronga hrefhttpwww.youtube.comwatchvcNo3DgKo3Ggampfeaturec4overviewamplistUUkQX1tChV7Z7l1LFF4L9jgamphd1 relnofollowexcellent video on google glassastrong and Rails development.  I learned sooo much about how to design and create for glass.  Being a new to Rails but getting my bearings I want to figure out how to invest my research time.  That being said, my questions is about optimizations between rails and native app engine supportp  pSince IO 2013 Google announced the huge overhaul to app engine.  Especially with the new support of PHP in app engine.  While I love Rails, its not far from from PHP  frameworks like Laravel other than the larger support of Rails.  Setting support aside and focusing on optimizations p  ul lipstrongwouldnt it be in the developers best interest to use app engine in the log run when developing for Google glassstrong pli lipstrongSeeing that app engine doesnt support rails would it not be advantageous to develop in native app engine languages such as php, go, java, python, google dartstrong pli ul  pemI have no idea why this would be faster other than maybe a less request.  But better is better at this point because Im so new to it all.em  p

Negative 59704 pI am using a Breadth first search in a program that is trying to find and return the shortest path between two nodes on an unweighted digraph.p  pMy program works like the wikipedia page psuedo codep  pThe algorithm uses a queue data structure to store intermediate results as it traverses the graph, as follows Enqueue the root node Dequeue a node and examine it If the element sought is found in this node, quit the search and return a result. Otherwise enqueue any successors the direct child nodes that have not yet been discovered. If the queue is empty, every node on the graph has been examined  quit the search and return not found. If the queue is not empty, repeat from Step 2.p  pSo I have been thinking of how to track number of steps made but I am having trouble with the limitations of java I am not very knowledgeable of how java works. I originally was thinking that I could create some queue made up of a data type I made that stores steps and nodes, and as it traverses the graph it keeps track of the steps. If ever the goal is reached just simply return the steps.p  pI dont know how to make this work in java so I had to get rid of that idea and I moved on to using that wonky Queue  new LinkedList implementation of a queue. So basically I think it is a normal integer queue, I couldnt get my data type I made to work with it.p  pSo now I have to find a more basic approach so I tried to use a simple counter, this doesnt work because the traversal algorithm searches down many paths before reaching the shortest one so I had an idea. I added a second queue that tracked steps, and I added a couple counters. Any time a node is added to the first queue I add to the counter, meaning I know that I am inspecting new nodes so I am not a distance further away. Once all those have been inspected I can then increase the step counter and any time a node is added to the first queue I add the step value to the step queue. The step queue is managed just like the node queue so that when the goal node is found the corresponding step should be the one to be dequeued out.p  pThis doesnt work though and I was having a lot of problems with it, I am actually not sure why.p  pI deleted most of my code in panic and frustration but I will start to try and recreate it and post it here if anyone needs me to.p  pWere any of my ideas close and how can I make them work I am sure there is a standard and simple way of doing this as well that I am not clever enough to see.p

Is there any setting in the Paypal manager settings to prevent this I tried to fix this by sandboxing top level navigation, but this wont allow me to redirect to paypal site by clicking the Check out with Paypal button.p  p2 For a payment with a Credit card, once the transaction is successful, I will convert the existing transaction to a profile byp  precode    TRXTYPERampTENDERCampPARTNERPayPalampVENDORAcmeampUSERAcmeampPWDa1b2c3d4ampACTIONAampPROFILENAMERegularSubscriptionampORIGIDltPNREFgtampSTART12012002ampPAYPERIOD WEEKampTERM12ampOPTIONALTRXSampOPTIONALTRXAMT2.00ampCOMMENT1Firsttime customerampAMT42.00 codepre  pThis works fine  and the recurring profile is created.p  pHowever, when I click on the Check out with Paypal button, this will take me to the Paypal page where I could login to Paypal using my Paypal credentials and then when I click the paynow button, it will deduct money from my account. This also has an PNERF value and when I used the same code above to convert the transaction to recurring profile by replacing Tender as P, but it shows me a response message that the transaction id corresponding to this id is not found. The Paypal checkout process doesnt show any information about the user is going for a reccuring payment section.p  pAlso, I followed a hrefhttpsgo.developer.ebay.comdeveloperscommunityblogsppintegrationsnateexpresscheckoutrecurringbillingpayflow relnofollowExpress Checkout with recurring billinga to do the task, but I got BAID as null in the DoExpressCheckout step. p  pI need both pay with paypal and pay with credit options on my site, so what parameters should I use to accomplish thisp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 59704 pThough not consequential it is quite annoying to see these warningsp  precodeUnable to simultaneously satisfy constraints. Probably at least one of the constraints in the following list is one you dont want. Try this 1 look at each constraint and try to figure out which you dont expect 2 find the code that added the unwanted constraint or constraints and fix it. Note If youre seeing NSAutoresizingMaskLayoutConstraints that you dont understand, refer to the documentation for the UIView property translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints       ltNSLayoutConstraint0x19288a20 V6[UILabel0x19288640]   Names UITableViewHeaderFooterContentView0x192885b0 gt,     ltNSLayoutConstraint0x19288a70 V[UILabel0x19288640]6   Names UITableViewHeaderFooterContentView0x192885b0 gt,     ltNSAutoresizingMaskLayoutConstraint0x19289cd0 hamp vamp V[UITableViewHeaderFooterContentView0x192885b00]gt   Will attempt to recover by breaking constraint  ltNSLayoutConstraint0x19288a70 V[UILabel0x19288640]6   Names UITableViewHeaderFooterContentView0x192885b0 gt codepre  pThere is nothing wrong of my constraints. The issue occurs when UIKit tries to do layout for the codeUITableViewHeaderFooterViewcode with these constraints when the view is initially of zero size. Of course it is impossible to satisfy any constraints with any positive metrics.p  pOne obvious workaround is to set a lowerthancodeUILayoutPriorityRequiredcode priority or use codeNSLayoutRelationLessThanOrEqualcode instead of codeNSLayoutRelationEqualcode for each positive metrics. But then I need to add these crutches to all of my constraints on all of my views. Not to mention that what I really want are hard and fast not optional constraints. p  pAnother workaround is to set a initial frame for codeUITableViewHeaderFooterViewcode. But considering its designate init method is codeinitWithReuseIdentifiercode not codeinitWithFramecode and it is the responsibility of codeUITableViewcode and codeUITableViewDelegatecode to specify frame for codeUITableViewHeaderFooterViewcode, it neither feels a good workaround.p  pSo any better onesp

Negative 59704 pI want to compute a multiway join in Hadoop framework. When the records of each relation get bigger from a threshold and beyond I face two memory problems,p  p1 Error GC overhead limit exceeded,p  p2 Error Java heap space.p  pThe threshold is the 1.000.000  relation for a chain join and a star join.p  pIn the join computation I use some hash tables i.e.p  precodeHashtablelt V, LinkedListlt Kgtgt ht  new Hashtablelt V, LinkedListlt Kgtgt someSize, o.75F codepre  pThese errors occur when I hash the input records and only then for the moment. During the hashing I have quite many for loops which, produce a lot of temporary objects. For this reason I get the 1 problem. So, I solved the 1 problem by setting K  StringBuilder which is a final class. In other words I reduced the amount of temporary objects by having only few objects which their value, content changes but not themselves.p  pNow, I am dealing with the 2 problem. I increased the heap space in each of the nodes of my cluster by setting the appropriate variable in the file HADOOPHOMEhadoopconfhadoopenv.sh. The problem still remained. I did a very basic monitoring  of the heap by using VisualVM. I monitored only the master node and especially the JobTracker and the local TaskTracker daemons. I didnt notice any heap overflow during this monitoring. Also the PermGen space didnt overflow.p  pSo for the moment, in the declaration,p  precodeHashtablelt V, LinkedListlt Kgtgt ht  new Hashtablelt V, LinkedListlt Kgtgt someSize, o.75F codepre  pI am thinking of setting V  SomeFinalClass. This SomeFinalClass will help me to keep the amount of objects low and consequently the memory usage. Of course a SomeFinalClass object will have the same hash code independently of its content by default. So I will not be able to use this SomeFinalClass as a key in the hash table above. In order to solve this problem I am thinking of overriding the default hashCode method and by a similar String.hashCode method. This method will produce a hash code based on the content of a SomeFinalClass object.p  pWhat is your opinion on the problems and the solutions above What would you dop  pShould I monitor also the DataNode daemon Both of the errors above are TaskTracker errors, DataNode errors or bothp  pFinally, will the solutions above solve the problems for an arbitrary amount of records  relation Or soon or later I will have the same problem againp

Negative 59704 pHello and thanks for your time. I have just read multiple tutorials regarding clicking objects with the mouse in three.js. Unfortunately there was no mention if this is possible with sprites. As a workaround I attempted to apply a .png image to a plane geometry. While this worked as far as clickability is concerned it looked very sloppy and didnt auto rotate towards the camera. Dose an object have to have a mesh to be clickable and if so is there any way to apply a invisible mesh to a sprite Or any other workaround. I assume Im missing something.p

Without caring about their keys.p  pI would put the call to fileWriter.write where the call to console.log is now. The call to cursor.continue would be in the onwrite callback. Otherwise, I would be issuing a write before the previous one had completed, which is illegal.p  pThis seems to be impossible, because, as writing is asynchronous, the onsuccess callback would return after write is called, thus ending the transaction and rendering the cursor invalid, even if its captured in a closure.p  pAm I right about this Im about to code it to accumulate the entire collection of objects in memory, so I can write them after the cursor completes, although thats not my first choice.p  pNOTE I dont think theres a synchronous form of writing, but, even if there were, I couldnt use it as this code will be in a Chrome App.p

Negative 59704 pBit of a noob when it comes to the concept of website hosting and database hosting, especially on an international level. Sorry for the long question, I just couldnt seem to find any place that explains these things in a way that doesnt make you scratch your head and hit the Close Tab button halfway through the explanation I feel like Stack Overflow should have some kind of general guideexplanation for these things, because there are a lot of people out there like myself who can code and write webcomputermobile applications, but still have a pretty frazzled understanding of how the basic entities of servershostingwebsites work.p  pFirst, what I understand and please correct me or edit this post if my understandings are wrong. I understand that one strongsimple, basic websitestrongp  ol liIs hosted on one server either cloud or physical.li liThis server on Rackspace, AWS or another webhost allows the admin to store the websites database and accompanying server code in RubyPythonPHPetc.. li liWhen a user navigates to the website, the domain is directed to the server, and the server processes and relays the information to the user based on the request. li ol  pThis is simple enough, mostly because it is emone website, and one serverem.p  pWhat I dont understand is how this all works when the database becomes too large to host on one computer, and you wish to maintain the website so that it is highperformance and lowlatency across the world. When websites like Google, Facebook and Alibaba are accessed from the United States, India, China, etc, they relay information back to the user instantaneously. Of course, they have thousands of servers.p  pSo here come the questions for a website that needs to be stronghigh performance across different localesstrong.p  ol liWhat would such a configuration look like Multiple servers in different locations Would this be a mandatory configuration to maintain low latency Or can one accomplish this with a datacenter in one locationli liWhat is stored on these datacenter servers Of course, the information from the website, but how so Is the accompanying server code stored on each server separately One server li liIs the database and all the accompanying information hosted on these different endpoint servers How does the site know which server to communicate with to gather the needed data Is there one entryrouting server How is the information maintained across several different servers in such a manner that it allows them to communicate with each other without losing precious latency timeli liIs there one central databasedatacenter that feeds different datacentersservers in different locations Or are they spliced up and placed on several different servers If so, how is the data maintained so that it all seamlessly stays connectedli ol  pBasically, I am having a lot of trouble envisioning emany sort of a setup that goes beyond having just one server supporting one websiteem. p  pRight now I have the familiar configuration of running a MySQL database for my website off a server in my room, and its so simple to understand what is going on.

Negative 59704 pI have a default cache that is fairly small and static. It contains just string keys and a string objects. p  pSince I wont be using anywhere near the allowed amount of memory, Id like to just preload all of the objects into the cache on startup and have them never expire. I added a log message on start indicating that the cache was loaded.p  pRight now the project is still in development so the cache isnt being hit often other than by web spiderscrawlersscripts. The problem Im seeing is that every hour to few hours, Im seeing the log message that my cache was loaded. Id expect it to load once and then not reload until I force it to.p  pIs there any way to keep the cache alive so that it doesnt have to frequently reload Is it like an IIS worker process that dies out after some amount of inactivityp  pFYI I have the cache configured for Expiry Policy Never, Time 0min, Eviction Disabled. Also the way I check if the cache is still alive is that on load I add a special object to the cache. Then I check to see if that object exists and if it doesnt I assume the cache needs to be reloaded.p

Negative 59704 pHi an app that Ive designed is currently being developed by a Programmer oversees. Many of the designs of the app match the Apple iOS7 app designs such as the Apple notes, clock and calendar apps. For example, the add alarm screen of my app matches exactly the add alarm page of the apple Clock app.p  pI have told him to copy these designs, but says he would need all the specific values of all these pages such as height of all tables, margins, font sizes, background colours  etc. p  pAs I have no real experience working with iOS programming I assumed that Apple included templates for developers when making an app such as the standard design information for table and modal views such as settings pages.  p  pEg. if you were to create the modal view shown the bottom of this link p  pa hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationuserexperienceconceptualtransitionguideTempViews.htmlapplerefdocuidTP40013174CH11SW1 relnofollowhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationuserexperienceconceptualtransitionguideTempViews.htmlapplerefdocuidTP40013174CH11SW1a p  pwould you have to work out from scratch what the values of every element is Or is there some sort of template included in the API, with standardised or recommended values for each major design elementp  pIt would just be a great help if he were able to have access to templated information used by Apple in iOS7 instead of having to analyse all the apple design screens to save development time.p

Negative 59704 pWe are 99 a Java shop, and we use Jenkins as a CI tool. Recently, there have been some .NET project that we needed to compile and build, and I was able to setup a Jenkins slave to do that.p  pTheres one project that as part of the build process compiles Flash applications. It comes with a codebuild.xmlcode and runs under Ant. There were two targets, one called codebuildandpostcode and another called codebuildandpostwithFlashcode. It runs this compile taskp  precodelttarget namecompile descriptioncompile flash and copy to dist gt      ltexec dirsrcflash          executableCProgram FilesAdobeAdobe Flash CS3flash.exe           searchpathtrue gt         ltarg linecompileProject.jsflgt     ltexecgt      ltecho messageFlash exited gt     ltfail messageFlash Compile produced errorsgt         ltconditiongt             ltisfileselected filesrcflashcompilelog.txtgt                 ltandgt                     ltcontains textError casesensitivenogt                     ltcontains textWarning casesensitivenogt                 ltandgt             ltisfileselectedgt         ltconditiongt     ltfailgt  lttargetgt codepre  pWhen running Jenkins with the codebuildandpostwithFlashcode target, I noticed that Jenkins would start the compile task and then sit there without doing anything until I kill the job. Nothing was being printed in the log. Running the codebuildandpostcode task which does everything that codebuildandpostwithFlashcode does without the compile worked.p  pI opened the build server, ran the Ant codebuildandpostwithFlashcode target and to my surprise, a GUI opened up while the compile was taking place. I didnt have to do anything. The GUI closed after the compile, and Ant continued, but I now realize that Jenkins was not able to run the codecompilecode task because theres no terminal associated with its tasks.p  pIs there a way to run this compile without opening up the GUI I can compile VisualStudio projects without opening VisualStudio. Can I do this with Flash This is CS3. Otherwise, I wont be able to do builds with Jenkins.p

Ive got the progress bar set up with bindings something like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comICben.png altBinding Screenshotp  pThe progress bar seems to stay on whatever my null placeholder is as proven by changing the null placeholder to 1, not redrawing or updating to accommodate any further progress. codecurrentProgresscode is only set once an operation has started, which will be why the progress bar uses the null placeholder at first, but it makes no effort to update the progress bar when an NSProgress object is set to that property.p  pItd be great if somebody could help me out here There must be something stupid Im doing wrongp

Negative 59704 pThrough my JavaGrails webapp, Id like to have a formprogram that allows the user to upload a SQL file or paste the contents and have it executed. Exactly like the SQL Workshop in Oracle Apex does. My ideal solution would be if I could embed the SQL Workshop that comes in Apex within my webapp. p  pIve seen the posts regarding multiline SQL files.. they usually involve parsing for semicolons, and I couldnt find one that seemed to properly handle that and declarebeginend blocks and Oracle DDLs all at the same time. Plus, they all seem to try to reinvent what SQL Plus does. Being able to invoke SQL Plus would also great, but Im not sure theres a way to do that cleanly through a webappp  pQuestions  1 Is there anyway to embed the SQL Workshop that comes with Apex within my custom webapp  2 If not... Is there a clean way to invoke SQL Plus through a GrailsJava webapp One that would also be platform independent p  pPlease feel free to provide any feedback... Im new to web development so would appreciate any advice.p

Negative 59704 pSuppose you have a class that has private members which are accessed a lot in a program such as in a loop which has to be fast. Imagine I have defined something like thisp  precodeclass Foo  public       Foounsigned set          variset           const unsignedamp readvari const  return vari   private     unsigned vari  codepre  pThe reason I would like to do it this way is because, once the class is created, vari shouldnt be changed anymore. Thus, to minimize bug occurrence, it seemed like a good idea at the time.p  pHowever, if I now need to call this function millions of times, I was wondering if there is an overhead and a slowdown instead of simply usingp  precodestruct Foo      unsigned vari  codepre  pSo, was my first impule right in using a class, to avoid anyone mistakenly changing the value of the variable after it has been set by the constructor Also, does this introduce a penalty in the form of a function call overhead.

Negative 59704 pI am trying to send a protocolbuffer file through winsock but Im having the following problem atm. When I send the data it might be a serialized version of proto packet A or B but the server doesnt know that. All proto packets have an ID field as first field so I made a packet C that only has an ID as field.p  pWhen the server receives a packet it deserializes it first to a C proto object just to check the ID it has. After that, when the server knows the ID, it can be deserialized again to the right proto object.p  pSo, at the moment, I do this but when the packet arrives which is also a C object to test it out it gets deserialized to a C object and it returns this errorp  precode[librotobuf] Cant parse message of type C because it is missing reauired fields ID codepre  pThis is seems weird because I have it filled in when I send it. Does this have something to do with the byteorder Im kind of lost on this one.p  pAny help is appreciated. I hope the problem is clear.p

Negative 59704 pI am a beginner to programming, R, shiny, and ggvis, trying to wrap my head around reactive data updating based on user input. Below is a reproducible example of a shiny App containing a time course plot of the type I am trying to build.p  pThe app should run, and should update upon the change of user input. However, the plot only updates when the x, y, and size variables are called in the ggvis call using the mapping syntax   . My intuition is that the use of the setting syntax    or the    operator would help solve the following problemp  pThe problem is that instead of a new plot being generated when the user input is changed, and that new plot being sent to the client, I would like the data points to update dynamically  fly across the plot to their new x,y,size position.p  pIm not yet syntactically comfortable with how ggvis binds a given data point with x, y, and size values taken from individual columns of a data frame to an updated data point of three different columns in the same row of that data frame.

Negative 59704 pI did some research but I didnt find a satisfying answer yet. I have a javascript project file and a library where some functions are defined like thisp  precodeLibrary.js  FElib            initLib functionparam1, param2             var init  param1  true             console.loginit           codepre  pNow in my project.js file I call the function and pass false as a parameterp  precodeFElib.initLibfalse, test codepre  pIn this case param1 is giving me false if I log it before the variable declaration. Afterwards its using the default true. It seems like it is interpreting false as undefined were I thought that its only checking for undefined..p  pWhy is the behaviour like thisp  pWhen Im using a string its perfectly working. Using 0 or 1 as a parameter is also not working and its using the default variable declaration..p  pAs a workaround I declared the variable as an object which is workin fine again like sop  precodeLibrary.js FElib            initLib functionoptions             var defaults                   param1      true,                 param2      string,                          var options  .extend, defaults, options           codepre  pNow calling the function is working fine even with boolean argumentsp  precodeFElib.initLibparam1false, param2string123 codepre  pThe 2nd approach seems to have a little overhead thinking of a function with only 1 boolean variable as an argument. p  pCan anybody explain this behaviourp

Negative 59704 pI am a SDET for a company where my primary task is to automate test and validate data. Without boring, ill get to the point.p  pI have been appointed to write Python scripts that validate data that comes into the company. I am a beginner at Python but have worked with Java automation via WebDriver and simple programs. I am not a guru software engineer by any means but have the intentions of learning as much as possible.p  pMy objective is to make a web based application where a user can import data files ex csv file and select various test cases ex are the headers correct, is the data weekly or monthly, is the formatting correct and run the test on the data. I have written SOME Python scripts already.p  pI was thinking of having a simple page with checkboxes and a user can check the test cases and hit submit which will run the script on the imported data file and spit out results on which test cases passed and failed.p  pAfter doing some research, I found Django web frameworks which seems like I might be able to use for this project.p  pAm I mistaken or is this possible with Djangop  pOnce again, I am a beginner with Python and Django so please go easy on me. p  pAny help is appreciated. Thank you. p

Negative 59704 pWe use Spring Security 3.1.3 to manage the login sessions for iCrumz.com. We are experiencing an intermittent failure of Spring Securitys remember me feature. Users are required to login often ranging from just about every use to every few days instead of 2 weeks since last visit Spring Security default.p  pThe failure seems to be independent of browser or operating system. It has been randomly observed on our Development, Staging and Production servers. The duration of remembered login and the user activity immediately prior to the failure appear to be random.p  pI have captured aggregated log snippets that demonstrate successful and unsuccessful remembered logins.p  pThe problem seems to begin with Tomcat apparently returning a status 500, which shows up in the nginx log.  What strikes me as odd is that the first sign of trouble in the Tomcat log catalina.out is the No HttpSession currently exists entry, which does not appear for over .6 seconds after the 500 reported by nginx. That leads me to wonder if the timestamps are not truly coordinated, even though nginx and Tomcat are running on the same Linux machine. I have confirmed the log time vs clock time is accurate, by comparing known real world events like logging in, with the logs.p  pAll URLs are configured in nginx to use HTTPS sitewide, but the connection between nginx and Tomcat is http not https. I dont see why that would be a problem, but I read somewhere in the last few days that it might be, so Im mentioning it in case it matters.p  pAny troubleshooting pointers, assistance, comments, etc., would be most appreciated.p  p61014  As noted in the comments, this problem was found to be a symptom of a loss of session, which is not a remember me problem.p  pRememberMesuccess.txt sorted latest entry on topp  precode52914 63111.809 AM 20140529 063111,809 [httpbio8080exec7] DEBUG org.springframework.security.web.context.SecurityContextPersistenceFilter  SecurityContextHolder now cleared, as request processing completed sourcetype  applicationtomcat 52914 63111.809 AM 20140529 063111,809 [httpbio8080exec7] DEBUG org.springframework.security.web.context.HttpSessionSecurityContextRepository  SecurityContext stored to HttpSession org.springframework.security.core.context.SecurityContextImplc9dc36eb Authentication org.springframework.security.authentication.RememberMeAuthenticationTokenc9dc36eb Principal org.springframework.security.core.userdetails.User329d9783 Username [PROTECTED] Password [PROTECTED] Enabled true AccountNonExpired true credentialsNonExpired true AccountNonLocked true Granted Authorities ROLEADMIN,ROLEUSER Credentials [PROTECTED] Authenticated true Details org.springframework.security.web.authentication.WebAuthenticationDetails957e RemoteIpAddress 127.0.0.1 SessionId null Granted Authorities ROLEADMIN, ROLEUSER sourcetype  applicationtomcat 52914 63111.809 AM 20140529 063111,809 [httpbio8080exec7] DEBUG org.springframework.security.web.access.ExceptionTranslationFilter  Chain processed normally sourcetype  applicationtomcat 52914 63111.503 AM 20140529 063111,503 [httpbio8080exec7] INFO  com.icrumz.icrumz.web.IcrumzController  populateCollection 4 Columns, 23 Folders, 108 Bookmarks sourcetype  applicationtomcat 52914 63111.000 AM 23.242.113.153   [29May2014063111 0700] GET icrumz.html HTTP1.1 200 13453 httpsicrumz.comlogin.html Mozilla5.0 Macintosh Intel Mac OS X 1068 AppleWebKit537.36 KHTML, like Gecko Chrome35.0.1916.114 Safari537.36 sourcetype  accessnginx codepre  pRememberMefailure.txt sorted latest entry on topp  precode52914 113105.704 AM 20140529 113105,704 [httpbio8080exec10] DEBUG org.springframework.security.web.context.SecurityContextPersistenceFilter  SecurityContextHolder now cleared, as request processing completed sourcetype  applicationtomcat 52914 113105.704 AM 20140529 113105,704 [httpbio8080exec10] DEBUG org.springframework.security.web.context.HttpSessionSecurityContextRepository  SecurityContext is empty or contents are anonymous  context will not be stored in HttpSession. sourcetype  applicationtomcat 52914 113105.704 AM 20140529 113105,704 [httpbio8080exec10] DEBUG org.springframework.security.web.authentication.rememberme.PersistentTokenBasedRememberMeServices  Cancelling cookie sourcetype  applicationtomcat 52914 113105.654 AM 20140529 113105,654 [httpbio8080exec10] DEBUG org.springframework.security.web.authentication.rememberme.PersistentTokenBasedRememberMeServices  Rememberme cookie detected sourcetype  applicationtomcat 52914 113105.654 AM 20140529 113105,654 [httpbio8080exec10] DEBUG org.springframework.security.web.FilterChainProxy  icrumz.html at position 7 of 11 in additional filter chain firing Filter RememberMeAuthenticationFilter sourcetype  applicationtomcat 52914 113105.654 AM 20140529 113105,654 [httpbio8080exec10] DEBUG org.springframework.security.web.FilterChainProxy  icrumz.html at position 6 of 11 in additional filter chain firing Filter SecurityContextHolderAwareRequestFilter sourcetype  applicationtomcat 52914 113105.654 AM 20140529 113105,654 [httpbio8080exec10] DEBUG org.springframework.security.web.FilterChainProxy  icrumz.html at position 5 of 11 in additional filter chain firing Filter RequestCacheAwareFilter sourcetype  applicationtomcat 52914 113105.654 AM 20140529 113105,654 [httpbio8080exec10] DEBUG org.springframework.security.web.FilterChainProxy  icrumz.html at position 4 of 11 in additional filter chain firing Filter BasicAuthenticationFilter sourcetype  applicationtomcat 52914 113105.654 AM 20140529 113105,654 [httpbio8080exec10] DEBUG org.springframework.security.web.FilterChainProxy  icrumz.html at position 3 of 11 in additional filter chain firing Filter UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter sourcetype  applicationtomcat 52914 113105.654 AM 20140529 113105,654 [httpbio8080exec10] DEBUG org.springframework.security.web.FilterChainProxy  icrumz.html at position 2 of 11 in additional filter chain firing Filter LogoutFilter sourcetype  applicationtomcat 52914 113105.654 AM 20140529 113105,654 [httpbio8080exec10] DEBUG org.springframework.security.web.context.HttpSessionSecurityContextRepository  No SecurityContext was available from the HttpSession null.

Negative 59704 pI have a question regarding Hibernate caching mechanism.I have read in the articles that native SQLquery execution in hibernate, invalidates all regions of cache because hibernate does not have any idea regarding which particular entity it is going to affect.

Negative 59704 pI asked this question at BioStar and Cross Validated but it did not fit their format of questions as it is regarding the use of a software, so Im posting the question here hoping someone could help me or advise me as to how to get help on this matterp  pI am trying to use Sirene for Gene Regulatory Network Inference of expression data as it is a supervised inference program and seems simple and straightforward to understand. Also has good reviews. I seem to be having some trouble producing the Cytoscape file from Sirene and therefore I cannot view the network. I am new to MATLAB and theres no support for MATLAB here at my department and thus im incapable of identifying what could be causing this. I will really appreciate if someone could help me with this. I know this seems strange but I have been emailing the authors regarding this program and havent heard from them and its been quite a few months now.p  pI feel quite lost and am unable to get help from anywhere as few people seem to know about this program. But the reviews about this program are quite good as is indicated in this paper as wellp  pa hrefhttpgenomemedicine.comcontent4541 relnofollowhttpgenomemedicine.comcontent4541ap  pI will write everything in detail herep  pIve downloaded Sirene a hrefhttpcbio.ensmp.frsirene relnofollowhttpcbio.ensmp.frsireneap  pI am using MATLAB 7.10.0 R2010a, compiler Microsoft Visual C 2010 Express, libsvm3.18p  pThe program comes with test data for E.Coli which has expression, genenames, operongroups and regulation files in dataecoli folder. Then in results folder, there is a folder called ecoli with a MATLAB code file called runexperimentlibsvm. In the first instance, I wanted to test the program on given dataset of ecoli. So I changed the file locations in this runexperimnetlibsvm file to where I had saved them and everything is on the path now. Then I simply run this file in matlab and it begins to compute and print like so a number of timesp  precodeoptimization finished, iter  452  nu  0.000074  obj  28.403413, rho  0.994572  nSV  355, nBSV  0  Total nSV  355  Accuracy  100 393393 classification  and at the end, it gives me   3293 new predicted interactions in the known regulation matrix. codepre  pAlong with this, during computation, it plots a number of graphs such as roc, auc, aup plots. It also writes a text file called cytofile60.txt but its always empty and another text file called nbnewpred.txt which says one line only  Warning  level of precision 60  not reached.p  pI dont understand why that is. It might be my limited knowledge about MATLAB thats causing this but I was rather hoping, it would at least give me the cytoscape file for the test data that comes with the program because all the parameters would be optimized for this dataset. Do I need additional commands to write the network to the cytoscape file because I thought everything was already written in runexperimentlibsvm.m file and all one had to do was give path to the data files and thats what I did.p  pI will be so grateful if someone could help me with this.p  pEDIT It wouldnt take much time to run and is quite fast. If some MATLAB guru could quickly test run it on the given data which you dont have to download from anywhere and everything is in the zip folder of Sirene already, it will really help me.p  pThanks a lotp

Negative 59704 pWorking on a shopping app and I have a few different ways items are shown. There is the collection view where the item image is at its smallest. Then there is the detail view where the item is at its largest,  nearly taking up the whole screen. Then there is another app page dedicated to customers saved items the image size here is between the size of the 2 views above. p  pIm wondering if it would be best to have the images scale appropriately just before theyre displayed This will obviously slow things down. Not sure how this will perform on my collection view either. The thing I like about this approach is that I can have the images scaled appropriately depending on what view theyre being displayed on. p  pNow with my other method of scaling before upload it would mean saving 3 different versions of the image which I think is counter production. Ideally Id prefer one image that could be used every where in my app. The original images Im working with were quite large and were causing issues with my collection view scrolling process. p  pHow do you normally work with images What is seen as best practice Im wondering if theres a set maximum sized for images that works well with memory and scrolling in table views and collection views. p  pWould appreciate some advice before I move forward. p  pThanks for your time. p

Negative 59704 pIm trying to get an apache server configured on a Mac server to serve both a Web2Py app and a Flask application. This has become a mild nightmare. I would like the users to be able to go to the following urlsp  pcodehttpmy.domain.comcode   Web2py sitep  pcodehttpmy.domain.comsuburlcode  Flask sitep  pUnfortunately, when I visit the suburl, it always takes me to the Web2py site which then freaks out because theres no application named suburl.

Removing the Web2py site allows me to access the Flask site.p  pId rather not combine them into a single VirtualHost, because that causes problems with the two applications sharing the same Python interpreter and certain C extensions are apparently flipping out.p  pIve changed the domain and a few other names to hide protected information. Im also excluding a few AliasMatch commands that handle serving the static subfolders. Theres also another VirtualHost for the SSH server on port 443, but I didnt include it because I expect that to not affect things.p  pSo how on earth do I make it so I can visit both sites, instead of the Web2py site swallowing everythingp

Negative 59704 pSo here is my dilemma.  I need to pull several hundred API calls worth of data, parse them one at a time, and log matching data.  My problem is this takes awhile and Im on shared hosting and my FastCGI busy timeout cant be altered Web Host wont do it because of shared hosting I believe.  So Im completely stumped on how to get around this.  I cant do CLI because its a user facing tool where they input a list of data and thats what I match against.  So once the input is recieved I need the PHP to run by itself until completed probably awhile like couple hours.p  pI tried everything and nothing works.  At this point to try and trick the system I have the file being selfreferential instead of a loop but that doesnt seem to work.  I think thats my only way unless someone has a better idea and Im trying to figure out how to make every call back on itself restart in the eyes of FastCGI.  HELPp

Negative 59704 pIf I have an array which is using numerical keys and I add a key far outside the range so far, does it create the intermediate keys as well. For example if I have p  precodearray  array1,2,3,4 array[9]  10 codepre  pWill this cause php to internally reserve memory for the keys 48 even though they dont have a value with them.  p  pThe reason I ask is I have a large 2D array which I want to use for memoization in a dynamic programming algorithm because only a small number of the total cells will need to be computed. However it would be taxing on the memory to have an empty array of that size for the full 2D array. Is there a better way to do 2 key memoization I could use an associative array and append the keys with a separator or some scheme like that but if php wont make the extra keys I would rather for simplicity and readability just use the 2D array.

Negative 59704 pI have a bit of an interesting problem I am trying to currently figure out using angular.p  pI have 1 json object I need to use split between 2 controllers, I want to be able to change save new items and delete json the json in each controller separately. So when I modify something in one controller it just saves that part of the json  not the whole thing.p  pI will explain this as clearly as I can p  pI have a factory that sends the json to both controllers, heres what it looks likefake json data for now p  precode.factoryUserService, functionhttp   var LevelsHere  http.getassetsimagesgenerated.json           .successfunctiondata             return data            return      all function        return LevelsHere           codepre  pEach controller then lists it as a dependancy then calls it like so  p  precodeUserService.all.thenfunctiondata             scope.listTable  data.data              codepre  pThis works great, and the 2way data binding  is awesome in this case because if i change something in 1 controller, it changes immediately in the other. My real problem with this is I want to be able to save the content changed in the json in each controller individually. p  pSo, the Json has a parent name and 2 children. Each controller has access to the parent and 1 of the children so for example. controller 1 has parent and child 1, and controller 2 has parent and child 2. When I want to click my save function  for example in controller 1 I want to save the json to the backend to overwrite the old stuff strongbut onlystrong from the controller I am choosing to save. So Even if i made changes in controller 2, when I save 1, i Just want it to send parentits index and child 1 to overwrite.p  pI think the problem may root from the fact that I am fully binding the data in each controller to all the the json maybe Currently I am just trying to send the scope.listTable back, and its registering all the changes between both sections.p  pApologies if I rambled on here  I am trying to be as clear as possible. Thanks for taking the time to readp  pstrongEDITstrong I was thinking  and I dont know if this is possible so bear with me  Can it be designated that the json i bring into listTable only binds to what it needs. So for example  controller 1 only binded to all the parent and child 1 and not child 2. Is this possiblep  pstrongEDIT 2strong Following up on the previous edit  I think I boiled down the question to  can I only save certain parts of the json instead of the whole object. I cannot have it save both child 1 and 2 at the same time because it might overwrite things that are not meant to be saved at that time. so its either  can I just use the selected pieces of json, or can I just save the selected pieces of json. thanks again for readingp

Negative 59704 pI wrote a directory information utility and because I, and the people I wrote this for collect amp use vintage hardware, made it compatible with DOS and Windows 9x as well as Windows XPVista78 64bit because we also use those. The problem I ran into was with Windows 9x and FAT32 drives.  I managed to get it to work as long as Windows 9x was actually loaded, but if I boot to command prompt only, or restart in MSDOS mode I lose access to the Windows API that allowed me to get the large drive data and it defaulted back to the DOS routine I have.  These are limited to the 2GB limit routines.  Examining how the DOS 7.x programs chkdsk mainly, handle this as they have no problem reporting the correct drive sizes, it seems they use DOS interrupts primarily INT 21h, to do this.  Thinking, no problem, Ill do a quick version check, and if its DOS 7 or higher Ill just run a quick assembly routing to get the drive structure and calculate the total amp free space that way.  Only, the routine though it doesnt return an error, doesnt fill my buffer with anything.p  pHere is the codep  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltdos.hgt  void mainvoid      unsigned short hes,hdi,sectors,bytes     unsigned long tclusters,fclusters     unsigned char far drivedata     char test  0     char display[17]  0123456789ABCDEF     int count      drivedata  new unsigned char [63]      for count  0 count lt 63 count drivedata[count]  0      drivedata[0]  x3d     drivedata[1]  x00      hes  FPSEGdrivedata     hdi  FPOFFdrivedata  asm          push ax         push es         push di         push ds         push dx         push cx         mov ax,0x440d         mov bx,0x0003         mov cx,0x484a         int 21h         jnc GOOD         mov ax,0x7302         mov es,[hes]         mov di,[hdi]         mov dx,0x0003         mov cx,0x003f         int 21h         jnc GOOD          test  1 GOOD     asm          mov ax,0x440d         mov bl,0x03         mov cx,0x486a         int 21h         pop cx         pop dx         pop ds         pop di         pop es         pop ax           if test  1          printfThere was an error.rn         return             tclusters  unsigned long drivedata[48]     tclusters  tclusters  256  unsigned longdrivedata[47]     tclusters  tclusters  256  unsigned longdrivedata[46]     tclusters  tclusters  256  unsigned longdrivedata[45]     tclusters      fclusters  unsigned longdrivedata[36]     fclusters  fclusters  256  unsigned longdrivedata[35]     fclusters  fclusters  256  unsigned longdrivedata[34]     fclusters  fclusters  257  unsigned longdrivedata[33]      bytes  unsigned intdrivedata[5]     bytes  bytes  256  unsigned intdrivedata[4]      sectors  unsigned longdrivedata[6]     sectors      printfDrive C hasrn     printf   Total Clusters urn,tclusters     printf    Free Clusters urn,fclusters     printf          Sectors urn,sectors     printf            Bytes urn,bytes      printfrn     printf     0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   A   B   C   D   E   Frn     printf     for count  0 count lt 63 count          if count  16  0 printfrn c  ,display[count  16]         printf03u ,drivedata[count]          printfrn      return  codepre  pThat last bit was me trying to figure out what was going wrong.  I was getting strange results, and couldnt figure out a pattern.  Originally, I wasnt worried about clearing the buffer as the INT call should have been filling it with its own values except the first 2 bytes, which is supposed to be filled with the EDB data buffer size. After getting so many apparently random results, I added in the loop at the beginning to fill the buffer with zeroes, then add in the buffer size.  The results stopped being random at that point, they were invariably all zeroes, meaning the INT call isnt filling the buffer.  With a variety of tests, Ive confirmed that hes amp hdi are correctly being assigned the segment and offset of the buffer address.  Ive also tried es amp di to the pointer address instead of the buffer address.  I didnt think it would work as everything I read said to set it to the address and not to a pointer, but I was trying everything I could think of.

When recording the net traffic even for a short period alot of content gets generated, and most of it is not relevant. since im no expert in http, id like some help with directions as of which headers I can safely use assuming most web pages send them, and which headers might be omitted and so it will not be safe to rely on.p  pmy current idea involves find all the html files, and check what the main html files were no referrer or search engine referrer, and then recursively mark all the files called by these html files onward as relevant, and discard the rest.p  pthe problem with this is that Ive been told that I cant trust the referrer header, and I have no idea as of how to identify what html files were clicked by the user. Every kind of help will be appreciated, sorry if the post is not formatted well, this is my first question here.p  pEDIT Ive been told the question isnt clear enough, so all Im asking is for some way to determine which requests were triggered by the user and whic requests were automatically madep

Negative 59704 pI now have a working iOS 8 Custom Keyboard to input Chinese, and I am looking for the possibility to use this keyboard with external bluetooth keyboard. p  pMy first question is if anyone has successfully used external keyboard with custom keyboard I am asking because when I connect my Apple wireless keyboard to my iPad Air, the software keyboard wont show up hence I have no way to tell which keyboard I am using. Also using command  space does not switch to my own keyboard. p  pI then tried to use external keyboard with builtin Chinese Zhuyin Keyboard and it doesnt work, it just outputs Zhuyin symbols but no Chinese words to select from. p  pI can understand that external keyboard wont work for custom keyboards because the custom keyboard keys must be somehow associated with the external keyboard keys. However, I think at least the builtin keyboard should work. p  pSo my second question is if anyone has tried to use external bluetooth keyboard to input text using builtin keyboard other than English, preferably for languages that needs a mapping tablefor example, Chinese and Japanese, you input some symbols and there should be a list of words that you can choose from. p

Negative 59704 pI am trying to create a web app that could be used for submitting answers to quizes. And I am having troubles creating the view files.p  pThe submission form should look like a hrefhttpslh3.googleusercontent.comS66bUiKpoocVDHaVZPkx2IAAAAAAAAC58EWsMgHzqtWws800quiz1.jpg relnofollowthisa sorry, SO does not allow me to insert images in the body of the question.p  pIt is a case of nested model forms discussed by Ryan Bates in Railscasts, but there is an important difference. In Ryan Bates case there is a simple chain of associations a Survey model has many Questions, and each Question has many Answers.p  pWhat I am planning, though, is a bit more complex. In my case, a Quiz has many Questions, and a Question has many Answers, but what a user is presented with is a model called Submission. A Submission is associated with the User model and the Answer model, and it also has some additional information. Schematically, my associations look like a hrefhttpslh4.googleusercontent.comCvNBPBSL9YVDHbxC7yCDIAAAAAAAAC6QQpKYIxX1bAs800quiz3.jpg relnofollowthisap  pSo I need to create a form that will combine a model Submission with many unassociated models Questions and many associated models Answers. All I could think of for my newedit view file is thisp  pControllerp  precode   GET teststestidsubmissionsnew   def new     quiz  Quiz.findparams[quizid]      the next four lines of code are to select a subset of questions     variant  choosevariantquiz     submission  Submission.new     submission.variant  variant     questions  Question.where variant variant     questions.each question quiestion.answers.build   end codepre  pViewp  precode formfor [quiz, submission]  do f       f.fieldsfor answers do builder        questions.each do question       p          question.text         builder.label answertext, Your answer         builder.textarea answertext codepre  pBut it doesnt look right there is no association between the submission, the question and the answers. Could you please suggest how to solve this problem if there is no direct association between the Submission and the Question modelp  hr  pUPDATEp  pI can now create a form in the viewp  precode formfor [quiz, submission]  do f       questions.each do question       p          question.text        f.fieldsfor answer, question.answers.first do builder          builder.label text, Answer          builder.textarea text codepre  pThe trouble is, on submit the last answer overwrites all the privious answers, and in the params I get onlyp  pcodesubmissiongtanswergttextgtAnswer to the last questioncodep  hr  pUPDATE 2 p  pTo Marcelo Risoli sorry, I havent got the hang of StackOverflow behavior, and it doesnt allow me to write another comment. I apologize, I did not quite understand your suggestion at first. Your line codequestions.each  q submission.answers.build questionid q.id code is pure genius it associates codeanswerscode with the codesubmissioncode in the controller instead of in the view, as I initially tried to do.

I am worried that in reality git rebase would lead to repeating the same merge conflict over and over if I change a section of code repeatedly through several commits and some one else makes a small change to the same section of code. p  pI appreciate any help to getkeep me on the right trackp

Negative 59704 pIm trying to synchronize two folders and their sub directories between a client and a server. I have a modified version of a hrefhttpsdocs.oracle.comjavasetutorialessentialioexamplesWatchDir.java relnofollowthis classa which Ive posted below. In my Client class, I create a WatchDir object and call its processEvents method in an infinite loop. The method returns a myTuple object a struct containing the event type and a path object if an event is registered and null if not. The problem is that this only seems to work for the first event to happen in the directory i.e. if I add a file to the watched folder, my WatchDir object.processEvents returns one Tuple with an ENTRYCREATE event and never returns another Tuple for other file additionsdeletionsmodifications that happen after. Id like for processEvents to be continuously called hence the infinite while returning a Tuple each time some event occurs.

Negative 59704 pShort version I would like to use a font set to REPLACE Glyphicons emwithoutem also including Glyphicons CSS, and without modifying the source bootstrap.less file.p  hr  pLong versionp  pUsing Bootstraps own Grunt file and source files as a base, by default a build process will include Glyphicons in the compiled CSS file.p  pSince I do not plan to use Glyphicons at all, the lowest hanging fruit for me is to go ahead and compile this way, but also include the font I will be using for example, Font Awesome.p  pHowever, the more elegant way will be to only include the replacement font.p  pI can modify bootstrap.less, which includes this linep  precodeimport glyphicons.less codepre  psuch that the Font Awesome less file is used instead. However, the problem with this is that I am using Bootstrap as an untouchable library not as a modifiable source file.

Negative 59704 pI have an app that is a mix between a singlepage Backbone.js app and a Struts2 servergenerated web application. I am aware that this is not exactly standard practice, but it is not in my power to change the architecture.p  pThe application maintains some Javascript models in the client and does stuff with them what exactly is irrelevant here. In order to change the properties of those models, Struts2based actions have to be called over XHRs with the models POSTed to the form action using code.ajaxcode with the JSON converted to codeapplicationxwwwformurlencodedcode by jquery. This will return a HTML fragment representing a form, which can then be filled out by the user and is then converted back into a model using codeform.serializeArraycode and a custom transformation step. This has been working okayish so far, but now we have models that may contain arrays, for example like this onep  precode     name Jannik,     contactmethods [                      type mobile,             phonenumber 491....         ,              type email,             email jannik.jochem...              ]  codepre  pJQuery will convert this to form keyvaluepairs like thisp  precodenameJannik contactmethods[0][type]mobile contactmethods[0][phonenumber]491.... contactmethods[1][type]email contactmethods[1][email]jannik.jochem... codepre  pI now want to be able to iterate the entries in codecontactmethodscode using Struts taglib or anything else that is available in JSP, but I cannot figure out how to do this. If this is impossible, changing the way the JSON object is converted to and from keyvaluepairs is acceptable as well. Note however that the nested objects may have different field combinations, so just mapping the individual fields to array parameters would not work because the array indexes would get messed up.p  pIs there a way to accomplish this in Strutsp  pstrongEDITstrong heres the code note that this is a constructed example since I cannot post the actual code here due to confidentiality issuesp  pcodeJSONTestActioncodep  precodepublic class JSONTestAction extends ActionSupport   codepre  pcodejsontest.jspcodep  precodeltpage contentTypetexthtml pageEncodingUTF8gt lt taglib prefixs uristrutstagsgt  ltbgtParametersltbgtltbrgt ltpregt ltsproperty valueparametersgt ltpregt  ltbgtContact methodsltbgtltbrgt ltolgt ltsiterator valueparameters[contactmethods]gt     ltligtltpregtltspropertygtltpregtltligt ltsiteratorgt ltolgt codepre  pBackbone view snippetp  precodevar model       name Jannik,         contactmethods [                      type mobile,             phonenumber 491....         ,              type email,             email jannik.jochem...              ]  .ajax     url contextRoot  propertiesjsontest.action,     type POST,     data model,     success function data          var form  ltform idelementform roleformgtltformgt         form.appendToview.el         form.htmldata       codepre  pThe result is thisp  precodeParameters contactmethods[1][type][Ljava.lang.String5e2d7ab9, contactmethods[0][type][Ljava.lang.String7bd437fc, name[Ljava.lang.String29a7c0e7, contactmethods[1][email][Ljava.lang.String4469930e, contactmethods[0][phonenumber][Ljava.lang.String6f359f38 Contact methods codepre  pI want to iterate over codecontactmethodscode inside the JSP. p

Negative 59704 pHow can I make a a hrefhttpwww.insider.orgnode63499ksvma model aware that the first 100 numbers in a dataset are all time series data from one sensor, while the next 100 numbers are all time series data from another sensor, etc, for six separate time series sensor inputs Alternatively and perhaps more generally, how can I present twodimensional input data to an SVMp  pThe process for which I need a binary yesno prediction model has six nonperiodic time series inputs, all with the same sampling frequency. An event triggers the start of data collection, and after a predetermined time I need a yesno prediction preferably including a probabilityofcorrectness output. The characteristics of the timeseries inputs which should produce yes vs. no are not known, but what is known is that there should be some correlation between each of the the input time series data and the final outcome. There is also significant noise present on all inputs. Both the meaningful information as well as the noise appear on the inputs as shortduration bursts the meaningful bursts are always in the same general time for a given input source, but identifying which bursts are meaningful and which are noise is difficult i.e. the fact that a burst happened at the right time for one input does not necessarily indicate a yes output it may just be noise. To know whether the prediction should be yes, the model needs to somehow incorporate information from all six time series inputs. I have a collection of prior data with approximately 900 no results and 100 yes results.p  pIm pretty new to both R and SVMs, but I think I want to use an SVM model a hrefhttpwww.insider.orgnode63499kernlabs ksvma. Im having trouble figuring out how to present the input data to it.  Im also not sure how to tell ksvm that the data is time series data, or if that is even relevant. Ive tried using the Rattle GUI frontend to R to pull in my data from csv files, but I cant figure out how to present the time series data from all six inputs into the ksvm model. As a csvfile input, it seems the only way to import the data for all 1000 samples is by organizing the input data such that all sample data for all six time series inputs is on a single line of the csv file, with a separate knownresult files data presented on each line of the csv file. But in doing so, the fact that the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc. numbers are each part of the time series data from the first sensor is lost in the translation, as well as the fact that the 101st, 102nd, 103rd, etc. numbers are each part of the time series data from the second sensor, and so on to the ksvm model, each data sample is just considered an isolated number unrelated to its neighbor. How can I present this data to ksvm as six separate but interrelated time series arrays Or how can I present a 2dimensional array of data to ksvmp  hr  pUPDATEp  pOK, there are two basic strategies Ive tried with dismal results well, the resulting models were better than blind guessing, but not much.p  pFirst of all, not being familiar with R, I used the Rattle GUI frontend to R. I have a feeling that by doing so I may be limiting my options.

Im pretty sure it would do better if theres a way to avoid blasting away either the temporal data or the distinction between different sensors. How can I do that BTW, I dont know if its important, but the sensor readings for all sensors are taken at almost exactly the same time, but the time difference between one reading and the next varies by maybe 10 to 20 generally from one run to the next i.e. between training files, and I have no control over that. I think thats probably safe to ignore i.e. I think its probably safe to just number the readings sequentially like 1,2,3,etc..p

Negative 59704 pOkay, so I know that we can either forward HTTPS traffic via haproxy to backend servers intact or have SSL terminated at the proxy server, and let remaining course of the traffic be unencrypted. But is there a way to make haproxy work such that the traffic is decrypted at the server and recrypted before being sent to the backend nodesp  pBasically I am getting half the job done with SSL termination, but I want traffic to be encrypted again once it leaves the proxy server.p  pIs this possible with haproxy on its own or is there some other tool I could use in combination with haproxy to create and manage HTTPSSSL sessions with backend serversp

Negative 59704 pI have a spooky problem.p  pMy program talks to various electronic devices via an ftdi usb to serial port. On the hardware side it can happen, that the ftdi chip is disturbed by a short power outage. If this happens, the software should reset the connection and continue to talk to the device. This works fine as long as the power outage is long enough 0.5 s. If it is very short like lt0.1 s, it is no longer possible to reset the connection for several minutes. Every connection to the port fails with the message that the port is still in use. So here is what Ive tried so farp  pRunning the ftdi API commands FTResetDevice, FTCyclePort and even FTRescan and FTReload do not help.p  pUnplugging the device from both USB and power and replugging it does not help. The port is still blocked.p  pEven while the USB cable is disconnected, a phantom port is still visible in the windows device manager. All attempts to connect to this port fail with the port in use message, independently of which program I use to connect to the port.p  pI could also reproduce the effect if the port was not open when the power outage took place.p  pSo far, the only action that helped is restarting windows or waiting for a few minutes. Of course, this is not really a feasible option.p  pWhat Im looking for is a way to reset the USBserial port programmatically if it ended up in a phantom state. Maybe this could be directly handled via the windows API instead of the ftdi API.p

Negative 59704 pIve been given the task of updating some code which isnt working after our SQL SVR 200 to SQL SVR 2012 dont laugh conversion.  We have an automated task that creates 500ish xls files in a linebyline manner by using the old spOACreate command.  In 2000, this job always takes hours and is rickety at best.  Needless to say, it doesnt work at all in 2012.  Thats what you get for never upgradingp  pI rewrote the job by constructing a table, adding info into the table, amp doing a bulk export into xls using OpenRowSet.  The new task ran in less than 15 minutes and I was ecstatic.  Then Ops complained that the new files werent formattedp  pI looped back and tried to get the formatting into the automation.  Thats where everything fell apart.p  ol lipUse OpenRowSet and export into an xls template file that has an autorun vba code to do the formatting when the file is opened for the first time.

No method permitted the exportformat, though.p  pThen I discovered the REAL problem  When I export using BCPOpenRowSet and then try to open the file, I always get the file you are trying to open is in a different format than specified by the file extension error FYI Using Excel 2007.  I had sort of ignored this error, but after days of banging my head against the wall I can now see that this error was leading me to the real problem all along.  The export file regardless of xlsxlsmxlsx is not an actual excel file its really just a bunch of html tags.  This is why the formatting vba code wont work its not an actual excel file  No matter what I do, its still not a real excel file.  Formatting will never work because its simply not a real excel file.p  pSo, I need an automated method to export a table to some sort of excel format xlsxlsmxlsx and then execute a vba code to format bold, column width, numberdate formatting, etc. the newlyexported file.  This seems like such a routine taskbut I see now that routine lt easy.  Ive seen references to NPOI and ClosedXML in forums, but I simply cant believe that I need additional 3rd party software to accomplish this task.p

Negative 59704 pIve been using MVVM for a while now with WPF. And ive learnt a lot over the course of development going from never using it, to having a couple of applications developed in it p  pHowever, recently I had some comments directed at the code which made me wonder if im doing things the right way. My current setup works roughly like thisp  ul listrongModelstrong   Responsible for storing the data, data validation using IDataErrorInfo and dirty trackingli listrongViewModelstrong  Responsible for getting the data from a repository like pattern and formatting it for a views consumption things like filtering, ordering also responsible for command handling from the view save, load, filter changes etcli listrongViewstrong  The usual UI stuffli ul  pNow it was mentioned to me that i should strongNEVERstrong have business logic inside the model, and that the model should be as thin as possible, the viewmodel should be responsible for handling things such as data validation and dirty tracking.p  pIve seen comments and criticism on both sides of this, with people against and for putting logic in the model, What i have yet to see is any actual reasons for these sweeping statements. So id love to know if there is an actual reason i should be refactoring my setup.p  pAlso, given that i do move the logic to the viewmodel, I can see the need for having multiple viewmodels where i currently have a single, for examplep  ul licodePersoncode  Modelli licodePersonViewModelcode  Handles the dirty tracking, data validation etcli licodePersonsViewModelcode  Handles getting a collection of PersonViewModels, filtering etcli licodePersonsViewcode  The UIli ul  pThis seems a little redundant, but perhaps im misunderstanding something. What Im really looking for is some actual reasons for doing this one way or another, or if this is another argument like the use of codebehind in MVVM pure opinion with little reasons etcp

Negative 59704 pI have a worksheet with one Excel table. Time by time I may add or remove rows from that table. I created another table in another worksheet of the same workbook. I wish to automatically change the number of rows of that table to match the number of rows on the first table.

Negative 59704 pI know this question is similar to others but they have not provided me with an answer so far. I have an array of numbers in javascript which i pass back to my controller, Each number is an id for an object in the db which i will pull out and load into a jqgrid.

Negative 59704 pI need to plot a line graph with errorbars with matplotlib or if you have a better solution, really any plotting software. Similar to this, for example a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comDRhJL.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comDRhJL.png altenter image description hereap  pI am using a python script to call a java process, and I need to plot the results.p  pHeres the Python scriptp  precodeimport subprocess import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  arrSize  100, 500, 1000, 5000, 10000, 50000, 100000, 500000, 1000000, 5000000, 10000000  filename  instance.txt iterations  inputIterations   for i in arrSize     printnArray Size   stri  n     cmdStr  Java Driver   filename     stri     striterations     output  subprocess.checkoutput[java, Driver, filename, stri, striterations]     printoutput.decodeutf8.split codepre  pThe output from output.decodeutf8.split is a list of three elements, all floats. The idea is that I will run the test something like 30 times and then plot three lines with errorbars one for each of the three elements in the output list. I am entirely new to plotting and still fairly new to python, so I might need some handholding in the process. Again, if you think theres a better way to do this besides matplotlib I am open to suggestions.p

Negative 59704 pI am trying a show a console like screen in the ios app for ongoing current activities. I was able to make the GUI and other process. The data constantly written to a text file and textview parallel. As the textview has a limit to get max characters in its container, I am braking the data into chunks and fetching 10000 characters of old data if scrollbar goes towards top navigaitonbar and latest if goes downwards. The problem is, the scrolling becomes and handling data is difficult. Is there any plugin or working solution which works like xcode log console screen without any issue.p
