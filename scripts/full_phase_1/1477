Positive 1477 pThe GCC codeatomiccode API has multiple functions ending in codencode, e.g. p  precodeatomicloadn  atomicstoren codepre  pThe compiler also supports intrinsitcs with codencode replaced by 1, 2, 4, 8 or 16 which you have to infer exist from the docs  IMO the docs are pretty hazy for codeatomiccodes and should be improved.  When an explicit number is used this tells the compiler the width of the data the atomic operation should operate on. When codencode is used Im presuming the compiler infers the width from the type passed if it can, or errors otherwise.p  pI checked this last statement by passing a codevoidcode to codeatomicloadncode and it complained, which wasnt a big surprise.p  pSo my questions are p  ul liIs what I have said correct li liIs there any reason not to use the codencode version except in the case that you have some opaque pointer and need to explicitly tell the compiler how wide its pointee is li liAre there any other subtleties Im missing with this stuffli ul  pThanksp

Positive 1477 pIm wondering under what circumstances compilers like GCC and LLVM are able to optimize multiple calls in the same function to some of the trivial member functions like codesizecode and codelengthcode of STL containers to just one callp  pFor example, if I compare values to the size of a container twice in the same function, but never actually change the container can it combine these into one function call and if so whenp  pThe compiler should be able to do an optimization unless it might think that another thread could be mucking with the container simultaneously. On the other hand the typical codeit  x.endcode guard in a loop seems to be optimized to just one call to codex.endcode and I presume this happens, because if some other thread would be addingdeleting stuff from codexcode, then it would invalidate the iterator codeitcode, so were free to do the optimization, since we would have undefined behavior anyway.p

Positive 1477 pIm working with a C class which I CANNOT modify that declares an extern C function from within a cpp file not a .h.p  pHow do I call that function from another cpp file  p  pTo further complicate matters, the function is declared with the weak attribute, and as such I can overwrite it.  What Im really trying to do is call that weak function from my strong function in a manner analogous to calling a base class function from a derived class which is overriding the function. p  ul liMORE li ul  pAlright lets get really specific since ppl are asking for more info...p  pIm creating a Qt 5.5 project for an iOS App.  I found a bug where Qt will crash if you load the app face up.  See thread a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions32763586qtforioslocksupwhenappislaunchedfaceupqiosscreenmmassertionQt for iOS locks up when app is launched face up. qiosscreen.mm assertionap  pI am NOT building from the Qt source.  I am using it out of the box.  I can see the cpp source, but I cannot actually modify or include it.p  pI figured out a way with a static class to detect that my problem will occur before it does.  Since I dont actually know how to fix it, I want to display an error message at least rather than just having the app go to a black screen when you launch it.  p  pQt iOS apps load using the class qioseventdispatcher.  The cpp which I cant change or include declares a weak main function and another weak function called qtmn.  You are suppose to override qtmn as your main function  which this qt class calls.  You can, however, override the real main too and create your own native app without the qt underlying layers.  p  pI want to determine at RUNTIME I can do this at compile time now if Im going to have the qt functions called or my own to load a simple native app that will display an error message.  p  pHeres some of the qt cppp  precode    extern C int attributeweak mainint argc, char argv[]              autoreleasepool    ...             qEventDispatcherDebug ltlt Running UIApplicationMain qIndent             return UIApplicationMainargc, argv, nil, NSStringFromClass[QIOSApplicationDelegate class]                  ...       We define qtmn so that usermaintrampoline will not cause      missing symbols in the case of hybrid applications that dont      use our main wrapper. Since the symbol is weak, it will not      get used or cause a clash in the normal Qt application usecase,      where we rename main to qtmn before linking.     extern C int attributeweak qtmnint argc, char argv[]              QUNUSEDargc         QUNUSEDargv          QUNREACHABLE      codepre  pqtmn goes on the get called by the UIApplication selector void applicationDidFinishLaunching.p  pI want to provide a strong copy of main, and a strong copy of qtmn.  My copy of main will decide to load my native app, or call the qt weak main function somehow, which will then call my qtmn function in the standar Qt for iOS manner.p

Obviously my example is using value types, but I think my complaint holds for all objects. Why cant a generic collection equality just be a union of equalities of its types Unexpected behavior doesnt really cut it since there are separate provisions for finding reference equality. I suppose this would introduce the constraint of collections only holding object that implement codeIEquatablecode, as Konrad Rudolph points out. However, in an object like Dictionary, this doesnt seem too much to ask.p

Negative 1477 pGarbage collection in .NET leads many to believe that lightweight objects can be treated as temporary.  This seems especially true of arrays that hold object references to objects  that are instantiated outside of the context of the array initialization.  p  pConsequently, it would seem that it should not really matter if a new array is initialized within an iteration of a state machine, particularly if that state blocks in any fashion, such as with a call to codeWaitHandle.WaitAnycode.p  pI would much rather create a new array as a lightweight container onthefly to hold my WaitHandle objects, than to resize the codeWaitHandle[]code array using codeArray.ResizeltTgtcode.  p  pWhy  Well, assuming that memory is cheap and that codeArray.ResizeltTgtcode will have to perform a memory allocation or a memory copy of some sort anyhow, it seems more efficient to simply implicitly discard the array by passing in a new one every time into the static method like this p  precode using C 3.0 array initialization syntax eventIndex  WaitHandle.WaitAnynew[]  stateStopEvent , 5000 codepre  pCheck out this a hrefhttpkozmic.plarchive20080222ctricksarrayinitializationinc3.0.aspx relnofollowlinka for details on the array syntaxp  pcodestateStopEventcode is one of several potential events that may apply to any or all states, and those ManualResetEvent objects are declared at a higher scope, so it seems that managing the array is actually more work than its worth.  p  pFurthermore, if the code is declaring a temporary reference variable for the array and simply assigning a new array instance to it within each iteration of the state machine, whats the difference, from a performance perspective  Why not simply skip that step as shown in the code snippet above  p  pIs resizing the codeWaitHandle[]code array by using codeArray.ResizeltTgtcode, a better approach  p  pTaking byte[] arrays out of the picture, if I need to resize an array, wouldnt I just use a List or a Dictionary instance as is recommended a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions434761arrayversuslisttwhentousewhichhereap

Im doing all my work on a local machine I have setup, so I want to be able to work with the tech support to get an identical server setup.  Simple things like getting the correct php extensions enabled and ini file changes.  There is also a part of the site that has its access controlled by http authentication, so I would also need to work with the techs to get that correctly set up.  Access to folders outside of the web root is also definitely a plus for example, godaddy does not allow this via ftp to my knowledge. p  pThe programmer that was previously working on this site talked a bit with the techs at the current hosting company, and got the impression that they could not even correctly set up the pghba.conf file.p  pIm also looking for a company that either already provides pgPhpAdmin installed, or can properly edit the pghba.conf file so that I may install it myself.  The differences between the database for the old site and the new site that I will have finished are pretty substantial, so having such a tool would be a huge help to me when it comes to getting the site online and confirming that the database is setup correctly.p  pAnyways, sorry for the long winded post, and thank you for any replies p

Negative 1477 pI wrote a web page that displays images from several servers on my network via simple img tags with appropriate href values.  The servers require authentication before they will send the images.  p  pIt works alright, except on first load the page presents the user with a series of password prompts one for each server.  The user can select the Remember my password checkbox, and then subsequent refreshes of the page work without prompting, with correctly updated images.  That is, until someone closes out the browser, after which a new set of prompts awaits anyone who opens the page again.p  pAll of the credentials needed are known beforehand, and I dont care if someone could read them in the page source, since this page is in a protected part of an internal intranet site.  Everyone with access to this page knows the passwords anyway.p  pThe only browser were allowed to use is IE 7, so I dont care about compatibility with other browsers at the moment.p  pIs there any way I can use JavaScript or some other clientside code to automatically answer those prompts so the user never sees themp  pThanks very much, in advance.p
Negative 1477 pIm looking for a way to set up my own default property values for different types of controls in my C .NET windows application. The default property values should override the existing default values of the controls, but still be overridable by setting the property values explicitly in the designer.p  pThis is to simplify the process of changing default appearancebehaviour of controls when the client or myself change their mind for the 10th time. This relates especially to controls like the codeDataGridViewcode or 3rd party controls where there are tons of layoutrelated properties to maintain.p  pstrongI am aware of the ability to create inherited controls and use the codeDefaultValuecode attribute, but this is not the solution Im looking forstrong for a couple of reasonsp  ul liIts a hassle having to inherit of every type of control I want to specify custom properties for, not to mention overridingshadowing the properties and setting the DefaultValue attribute.li liI can no longer use the standard .NET controls, but have to use the inherited controls.li liThe number of inherited controls increases over time and clutters up the toolbox.li liMyself or other developers on the project forget to use the new inhertied types in times of haste, resulting in inconsitent behaviourappearance of controls.li ul  pThis is how I imagined that it will workp  ul lipstrongExample 1strong A codeDataGridViewcode by default has background color codeSystemColors.Windowcode. I set my own default value to codeColor.Bluecode how outrageous. In the designer, the default background color is used, i.e. the background color is not set explicitly in the .designer.cs file.

Ive searched across the SQLite documentation only talks about affinity, strongonlystrong matters it, SO threads, google... and found nothing.p  pstrongMy guessstrong Ive just slightly revised the SQL92 specifications, which talk about datatypes and its relations but not about its lengths, which is quite obvious I assume. Yet Ive come accross the Oracle and MySql datatypes specs, and the specified lengths are mostly identical for integers at least. Should I assume SQLite is using the same lengthsp  pstrongAside questionstrong Have I missed something about the SQLite docs Or have I missed something about SQL in general Asking this because I cant really understand why the SQLite docs dont specify something as basic as the datatypes lengths. It just doesnt make sense to me Although Im sure there is a simple command to discover the lengths.. but why not writing them to the docsp  pThank youp

In this scenario, I use the default constructorp  precode   new DataService.DataClient codepre  pwhich uses the builtin Endpoint Address string, which I assume is pulled from app.config.

And then when were done changing them, we can do configuration.Save and all the values get written out to a user file. p  pNow heres the catch. In debug mode, the configuration.save does not appear to actually persist your values from execution to execution, but when running the application normal outside of debug mode, the values persist. Which is good. So thats the only caveat.p  pstrongEDIT4strongp  pThere is another caveat. The changes made to the WSDLs do not take effect during runtime. The application needs to be restarted to reread the user config file values into memory apparently.p  hr  pThe only other thing that I might be interested in is finding a way once the values have been changed to revert the values to their defaults.

Negative 1477 pIve created an app with external settings in the Settings Bundle. Everything works perfectly. I save the data on every user interaction, and read the data on every view switch using viewDidAppear trigger. p  pThe issue comes when the user exits the application, then goes to Settings, changes a setting, and then relaunches the application. With iOS4, as far as I can tell, the app never really quits, it just goes into the background. Thus when the user relaunches the app, it returns to the exact same view they left it in, however, none of the settings changes take effect until the user switches views, triggering viewDidAppear and my corresponding variable loading and screen updating functions.p  pPut simply, my question isp  pstrongis there a function analogous to viewDidAppear that can detect that the app has reawakened from backgroundstrong, and where I can then trigger my data read and screen update functionsp  hr  pTo clarify, here is the code that I am trying to call in ChartViewController.mp  precode voidapplicationDidBecomeActiveUIApplication application      [self loadChartSettings]     [self.tableView reloadData]      codepre  pI dont even know where I would start putting this in AppDelegate, because all my processing and display generation code is in the ChartViewController.p

Negative 1477 pI would like to use the kaminari gem to paginate over search results. Since the gem does not pollute ActiveRecordBase and Array, kaminari is actually my preferred way to go from an architectural point of view. Unfortunately there is Rails 3 and its lazy loading concept that makes things a little bit confusing at least at my scenario.p  pIn my HAMLTemplate I would like to list all of my search results.

In the past I could do the followingp  precode unless results.empty   ... search results ...  else   ... no results found ...   paginate results codepre  pSince .empty does not force loading this does obviously no longer work in Rails 3. Jep, I could use .all in my Query to force loading. Unfortunately .all returns an Array and kaminaris paginate View helper does not work with Arrays the right philosophy imho.

Negative 1477 pI am regularly using stata at work. My text editor of choice is gvim. I have been using the scripts provided a hrefhttpscode.google.compnotepadstatsintegration relnofollowherea or a hrefhttphuebler.blogspot.com200804stata.html relnofollowherea to send code from vim to stata. This functionality is immensely practical and virtually the only thing the keeps me from switching to linux completely. The scripts are written in AutoIT, so I cannot use them in linux. They are also basically independent from the choice of text editor, the people who wrote them are using notepad.p  pEssentially, these scripts together with a few lines in my vimrc allow me to send selections or the whole file to a running stata window if none is open, stata is started first. p  pI am looking for a solution that does this in linux, but I have no idea where to start. In linux there are two different stata versions, stata for the command line and xstata is the gui version. I need to use the gui version as the functionality of the command line version is limited unfortunately, so screentmux are ruled out. p  pIf this is trivial, Im really sorry for missing it and would be immensely grateful for a solution. I also wasnt able to find an existing plugin for vim I could utilize. If not, I am willing to invest some time and figure out how to implement a solution. A pointer in the right direction would however be quite helpful. I am relatively new to linux and programming in general, but willing to learn. p  pRegarding tools I dont know bash, but it is something I want to look into anyways at some point. I have dabbled a bit in python, so that would also be ok. In case there is anything else absolutely superior for this task, please let me know.  p  pAny help is greatly appreciated. The AutoIT scripts are hosted on the website, but I can post my windows setup here if necessary.p  pEDITp  pOk, after some debate in the comments, here is the essential AutoIT script that I need to translate. I would prefer a solution that doesnt overwrite the content of the system clipboard each time though.p  pEdit2  I guess this is what the script does essentially It checks for an open stata window, selects it or executes one, pastes the contents that are to be executed into a temporary file, switches to the stata window, selects the command line with ctrl1 and anything that might already be written there with ctrla and then pastes do tempfile into the commandline, which then executes the code that was sent.

Negative 1477 pThis question describes two approaches of solving the sophisticated architectural problem related to ASP.NET MVC. Unfortunately our team is quite new to this technology and we havent found any solid sources of information on this particular topic except overviews where its said that MVC is more about separation than componentization. So as for now we are hesitating whether our solution is appropriate or there is a different obvious way to solve this problem.p  pWe have a requirement to make ASP.NET MVCbased design with componentization in mind. View engine Razor is also a requirement for us. The key feature here is that any level of controllers nesting is expected obviously thru codeHtml.Actioncode directive within code.cshtmlcode. Any controller could potentially obtain the data thru a webservice call the final design can break this limitation, as its described below.p  pThe issue is that the data must be obtained in async and maximum parallel fashion.  E.g. if two backend calls within the controllers are independent they must be performed in parallel. p  pAt first glance the usage of a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryee728598.aspx relnofollowasync MVC controllersa could solve all the problems. But there is a hidden caveat nested controller must be specified within codecshtmlcode only within a view. And a code.cshtmlcode view is being parsed after the original controller finished its own async execution. So all the async operations within the nested controller will be performed in a separate async slot and therefore not in parallel with the first parent controller. This is a limitation of synchronous nature of code.cshtmlcode processing.p  pAfter a deep investigation we revealed that two options are available. p  p1  Have only one parent async controller which will retrieve all the data and put this data into container dictionary or whatever. The nested controllers arent allowed to perform any backend calls. Instead of this they will have a reference to the initialized container with the results of all the backend calls. Bu this way the consumer of the framework must differentiate between parent and child controller which is not a brilliant solution.p  p2   Retrieve all the data from backends within a special async HttpModule. This module will initialize the same container which will reside, for instance within HttpContext. Obviously all the controllers in such a case will not be allowed to perform any backend calls, but they will have a unified internal structure in comparison with 1 option. p  pAs for now we think that the option 2 is more desirable, but we are more interested in the solid communityadopted way to solve this problem in a real enterpriselevel MVC projects.p  pLiterally any linkscomments are welcomed. p  p[UPD] A requirement of any level of nesting of controllers came from our customer which wants a system where fully reusable MVC components will be presented. And they could be combined in any sequence with any level of nesting  as it is strongalready donestrong in the existing webformsbased implementation. This is a business rule for existing app that the components could be combined anyhow so were not targeted to break this rule. As for now we think that such a component is a combination of controllerviewmetadata where metadata part describes the backend calls to be performed in the scenario 1 or 2.p

Negative 1477 pIve been working in Python with an array which contains a onedimensional list of values. I have until now been using the array.appendvalue function to add values to the array one at a time.p  pNow, I would like to add all the values from another array to the main array instead. In other words I dont want to add single values one at a time. The secondary array collects ten values, and when these are collected, they are all transfered to the main array. The problem is, I cant simply use the code array.appendotherarray, as I get the following errorp  precodeunsupported operand types for  int and list codepre  pWhere am I going wrongp
Negative 1477 pI know there are some differences between both of them, but suppossing that you already have a fullyoperating Java environment for developing, testing and production, will you ever consider using Ruby MRI instead of JRuby On top of that, I would also argue that you can inline Java, use Java datatypes and, most importantly, it almost always outperform Ruby. What do you think Is there any reason why one should consider Ruby seriously when compared to JRubyp

Negative 1477 pI have a client interface that sends binary data encoded in base64. The data is a 29 byte custom formatted payload of bytes that describes an event. The 29 bytes is made up of a number of fields each with unique lengths.p  pI need the server to decode that so I can extract the fields. Ive tried using the a hrefhttpnodejs.orgdocsv0.4.7apibuffers.html relnofollowBuffera object as I did with another use case where the a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8058424nodejsdataparsingrawbyteswithbufferdata was passed in hex formata, without success.p  precodebuff  new BufferAR0AAAEKCgsLDAwAAATSAAAADsgAAAAAAAAAzMQ, base64   track the current position  ... get out to the data portion of the message var position  3   event type var eventtype  buff.sliceposition,position3.toStringutf8 position  3 console.log... event type   eventtype      address var addr  buff.sliceposition,position3.toStringutf8 position  3 console.log... addr   addr    codepre  pThe .toStringutf8 is likely the root cause.

Negative 1477 pI currently configure my Ant builds to have a codedeploylocalcode target that creates a WAR of my web application, and then simply copies that WAR file to my local Tomcats codewebappscode directory.p  pThe problem is, every time I run Tomcat, it first unpacks all the WARs in its codewebappscode directory into folders, thus codeMyWebApp.warcode gets unpacked to a directory called codeMyWebAppcode before Tomcat finishes starting up.p  pIt is obvious that Tomcat is then deploying out of that copied directory not my WAR. I have proven this by stopping Tomcat, deleting the WAR but leaving the copied directory in tact, and then restarting Tomcat...it worksp  pThe huge painintheneck here is that every time I tweak my projects and run codedeploylocalcode to test them, I have to first manually delete the copied directory in codewebappscode otherwise Tomcat will ignore the new WAR file copied over from Ant, and instead just deploys from the old copied directory.p  pThis has become extremely annoying Ive spoken with my tech lead about this and he doesnt seem to have the same problem both of us are using Tomcat strong7.0.19strong. Furthermore, the Tomcat instances we have running in Dev, QA and Production dont suffer from this either. This tells me its a configuration issue on my end.p  pPlease advise And thanks in advancep

Negative 1477 pI am trying to design a database schema to model a Universitys schedule of classes.  Usually classes run either MWF or TuTh.  Implementation will be done using MySQL.  What would be the best way to design the tables for handling what daystimes classes take place  My current tables look like thisp  precodeTime   int TimeID primary key   Time ClassStartTime   Time ClassEndTime   int DaysOfWeekID foreign key  DaysOfWeek   int DaysOfWeekID primary key   varchar DaysOfWeek codepre  pThis above Time table would link to the Class table on TimeID.  I feel like there would be a better way of doing this however, especially when handling the days of the week.  Having a dedicated days of week type would be better for parsing on the front end as I plan on implementing a calendar with the database.  Any suggestions  Thanks in advancep

I can hear the ringtone from phone speaker and ringtone  tts from headset.p  pBut I have a problem with this way...p  pIn the headset, when TTS says something, the ringtone decreases volume and I can hear only TTS. After TTS ends, the ringtone volume increases to its previous level. Thats ok.

In this scenario Im fine with accepting that id is a facet of RavenDB. Fundamentally this is absolutely no different than codeGuid.NewGuid.ToStringcode as it creates an identifier that has no human understandable meaning and merely achieves the goal of global uniqueness. This is just arguably a nicer version of a guid, and will create better URLs and allow a human to communicate their id if its ever needed far easier than a string of 16 random hex characters.p  pIn another scenario takep  pcodeUser  string UserName, string Id codep  pIn this scenario I want to place true semantic meaning into my Id as opposed to just an unique number. p  pWith RavenDB this could be accomplished similar top  precodestore.Conventions.DocumentKeyGenerator  entity gt      User user  entity as User    ifuser  null       return  defaultKeyGeneration entity    return Users  user.UserName  codepre  pWhich then during this store operation you would end up with Usersdotnetchris p  pI could also approach this by instead of having User have a simple property for Id, to use a readonly propertyp  precodeUser      string Id  get  return Users  UserName  codepre  pIm having a hard time deciding which of these is the proper place for this construct.p  pIm leaning towards it should be included in the class directly, as this gives you information that it will be easy to load this object by id from user input without actually needing to query to the datbase to find codeUsers.Whereuser.UserName  dotnetchriscodep

The action1 method on the controller is set to return a JsonResult, perhaps like thisp  pIn the responding CONTROLLER and using a MODEL not important herep  precode    public JsonResult action1MyModel model              if ModelState.IsValid                      return Jsonnew  statusCode  1                    return Jsonnew  statusCode  0       codepre  pThis pattern works great when I use modern browsers that is, the latest versions from the three major vendors. However, when I attempt to do anything with Internet Explorer 8 and presumably before, I receive a File Download  Security Warning dialog box. I believe this dialog box pops up because the browser doesnt know how to handle the contenttype produced by a JsonResult applicationjson, and so prompts the user to save the return value instead. However, changing the content type in the JsonResult method to, say, textplain or texthtml, doesnt work either. Instead,  IE8 redirects the browser window to display the raw JSON sent back. Neither of these behaviors works for me.p  pI have the sense that the problem stems from the top, which is to say that the ajaxification of an Ajax.BeginForm form simply doesnt happen in IE8, but I could be wrong, and in any case, I dont know what to do about it. p  pAny cluesp  pThanks.p

Negative 1477 pIm using Rails 2.3.14 here, but its possible problem Im having is not confined to this particular version. This is all association and eager loading functionality that is still around in Rails 3, and has been around well before 2.3.14. Im in the process of upgrading from rails 2.3.8, where I was not having the problem described below.p  pThe code below is a mockup based on a much more complex production system. The classmodule scheme Im outlining is set up like this for a reason. Im actually including a few more details in this mockup than necessary to demonstrate the problem, hopefully make the overall structure of the system more clear.p  pSuppose I have several domain objects that can be driven, including vehicles carstrucks and golf balls. For each of these things, I have an ActiveRecord classp  precodeclass Vehicle lt ActiveRecordBase end  class Car lt Vehicle     include Driveable end  class Truck lt Vehicle     include Driveable end  class GolfBall lt ActiveRecordBase     include Driveable end codepre  pFirst note that codeGolfBallcode is a toplevel model class and the corresponding database table is codegolfballscode. On the other hand, codeCarcode and codeTruckcode are subclasses of codeVehiclecode. The database for vehicles is set up with STI, so codeCarscode and codeTruckscode both correspond to the codevehiclescode table with a codetypecode column differentiator.p  pSecondly, note that Im including a codeDrivablecode module on all the bottomlevel domain objects codeCarcode, codeTruckcode, codeGolfBallcode, and it looks like this in the actual system this module does a lot more too, including settings things up based on the specific including domain objectp  precodemodule Driven     def self.includedbase         base.classeval do             hasone driver, as gt driveable, classname gt self.nameDriver, dependent gt destroy         end     end end codepre  pSo each of these things can have a codeDrivercode, and its using a codeclassnamecode based on the including class name e.g. including class codeCarcode results in a codehasonecode with codeclassname gt CarDrivercode, because each of these referenced classes codeCarDrivercode, etc... contains specific business logic that is necessary for the associations use.p  pThere is a toplevel codeDrivercode class which sets up the polymorphic association, and then a similar subclass hierarchy as above for domain object driversp  precodeclass Driver lt ActiveRecordBase     belongsto driveable, polymorphic gt true end  class VehicleDriver lt Driver end  class CarDriver lt VehicleDriver end  class TruckDriver lt VehicleDriver end  class GolfBallDriver lt Driver end codepre  pThis is based on a single database table codedriverscode, using STI for all subclasses.p  pWith this system in place, I create a new codeCarcode stored in codecarcode below and associate it with a newlycreated codeCarDrivercode like this its split up into these particular sequential steps in this mockup to mirror the way the actual system worksp  precodecar  Car.create CarDriver.createdriveable gt car codepre  pThis created database row in the codevehiclescode table like thisp  precode id   type   ...    1    Car    ... codepre  pAnd a row in the codedriverscode table  like thisp  precode id   driveableid    driveabletype   type         ...   1    1               Vehicle          CarDriver    ... codepre  pcodeVehiclecode is the codedriveabletypecode as opposed to codeCarcode because vehicles are STI. So far so good. Now I open up a rails console and execute a simple command to get a codeCarcode instancep  precodegtgt car  Car.findlast gt ltCar id 1, type Car, ...gt codepre  pAccording to the log, here is the query that was executedp  precodeCar Load 1.0ms SELECT  FROM vehicles WHERE  vehicles.type  Car  ORDER BY vehicles.id DESC LIMIT 1 codepre  pThen I get the codeCarDrivercodep  precodegtgt car.driver gt ltCarDriver id 1, driveableid 1, driveabletype Vehicle, type CarDriver, ...gt codepre  pThis caused this query to be execute.p  precodeCarDriver Load 0.7ms SELECT  FROM drivers WHERE drivers.driveableid  1 AND drivers.driveabletype  Vehicle AND drivers.type  CarDriver  LIMIT 1 codepre  pIf I try to use eager loading, however, I get different results. From a fresh console session, I runp  precodegtgt car  Car.findlast, include gt driveable gt ltCar id 1, type Car, ...gt gtgt car.driver gt nil codepre  pThis results in codenilcode for the driver. Checking the logs, the first statement execute the following queries regular query and eager loading queryp  precodeCar Load 1.0ms SELECT  FROM vehicles WHERE  vehicles.type  Car  ORDER BY vehicles.id DESC LIMIT 1  CarDriver Load 0.8ms SELECT  FROM drivers WHERE drivers.driveableid  1 AND drivers.driveabletype  Car AND drivers.type  CarDriver  LIMIT 1 codepre  pAs you can see, in the eager loading case, the codeCarcode query is identical to the above, but the codeCarDrivercode query is different. Its mostly the same, except that for codedrivers.driveablecode type it is looking for codeCarcode where it shouldbe looking for the STI base class name, codeVehiclecode, as it does in the noneager loading case.p  pAny idea how to fix thisp

Negative 1477 pConsider a worker process which searches the web for particular data. Another process is needed to index the results of the first process for later use.

These operators return   values that depend on the internal representations of integers, and   thus have strongimplementationdefined aspectsstrong for signed types.p blockquote  pMy question is twofoldp  ul lipSince I want to work with the original bit patterns from the file, how can I convertcast my codesigned charcode to codeunsigned charcode so that the bit patterns remain unchangedpli lipIs there a list of these implementationdefined aspects anywhere say for MVSC and GCCpli ul  pOr you could take a different route and argue that this produces the same result for both signed and unsigned chars for any value of codec[i]code.p  pNaturally, I will reward references to relevant standards or authoritative texts and discourage informed speculation.p
Negative 1477 pI want to keep nogood scrapers aka. bad bots that by defintition ignores coderobots.txtcode that steal content and consume bandwidth off my site.  At the same time, I do not want to interfere with the user experience of legitimate human users, or stop wellbehaved bots such as Googlebot from indexing the site.p  pThe standard method for dealing with this has already been described here a hrefhttpwebmasters.stackexchange.comquestions19098tacticsfordealingwithmisbehavingrobotsTactics for dealing with misbehaving robotsa.  However, the solution presented and upvoted in that thread is emnotem what I am looking for.p  pSome bad bots connect through tor or botnets, which means that their IP address is ephemeral and may well belong to a human being using a compromised computer.p  pIve therefore been thinking about how to improve the industry standard method by letting the false positives i.e. humans that has their IP blacklisted get access to my website again. One idea is to stop blocking these IPs outright, and instead asking them to pass a CAPTCHA before being allowed access. While I consider CAPTCHA to be a PITA for legitimate users, vetting suspected bad bots with a CAPTCHA seems to be a better solution than blocking access for these IPs completely. By tracking the session of users that completes the CAPTCHA, I should be able to determine whether they are human and should have their IP removed from the blacklist, or robots smart enough to solve a CAPTCHA, placing them on an even blacker list.p  pHowever, before I go ahead and implement this idea, I want to ask the good people here if they foresee any problems or weaknesses I am already aware that some CAPTCHAs has been broken  but I think that I shall be able to handle that.p

Negative 1477 pId like to share several numpy arrays between different child processes with pythons multiprocessing module.

Negative 1477 pIm working on a custom module that will describe an external table to the Views module. Inside my module folder I have the required mymodule.views.inc file. However, whenever this file is present and my custom module is enabled Drupal constantly gives Ajax HTTP Error pop ups when I use a site feature that has Ajax any of the spinning daisies trigger this. The pop up always contains the module code in mymodule.views.inc after it says Ajax Error. The weird thing is every time I load the front page the PHP code in mymodule.views.inc is always displayed on the top of the front page.p  pIve seen this problem on SO and other sites a lot, but most of the time it can be traced back to an updated jquery.js file or a php.ini setting that will give scripts more time to run. So far neither of those fixes have worked. The only way I can make it go away for now is to either disable my custom module, or rename mymodule.views.inc to something else.p  pHeres an example of what the message looks like not verbatim copy, since I cant copy from these alert messages in Chrome.p  precodeAn AJAX HTTP error occurred.

Negative 1477 pWe are developing large MVC project and we have an intension to use HttpSessionStateWrapper as well as HttpRequestWrapper, HttpResponseWrapper, etc to add extended functionalities do this objects.

Negative 1477 pIm having several headaches trying to work in Eclipse for C development.p  pThe IDE persistently shows Errors and Warnings in the Problems pane, even after they have been solved  only a rightclickDelete seems to clear them.  Even then, a few will pop back up after a compile, which is probably related to the second issue...p  pMy codebase is rather small two projects, one for unit tests, one for a small library Im developing, though I do make use of basic C templating. However, Eclipse largely fails to code complete for included libraries, files in my own workspace but separate projects, and even occasionally files within the same project.p  pIve tried rebuilding the index on my projects and fiddled with a few settings, but to no avail. In the past I have used Visual C, with its wonderful Intellisense, but Im running Linux at the moment and want an IDE that can eventually handle multiple languages and toolchains  for which Eclipse excels.p  pIve tried googling but found no real help.  Does anyone out there have any hints for tweaking Eclipse CDT for better code completionanalysis  Or is this just the nature of nonVisual Studio developmentp

Negative 1477 pEDIT The whole problem turned out to be a network issue, but if you see any ideas on how I could optimize the process Id still appreciate it.p  pI am fairly new to Servlets and not far into my journey I have encountered a problem, one related to performance. I am trying to send a video file through the XHR object in my Google Chrome browser. The video file is stored in a Blob object. I use this function in my JavaScript scriptp  precodefunction uploadblob    var xhr  new XMLHttpRequest   xhr.openPOST, TestOdbieracz, true   xhr.onload  functione  console.logloaded    xhr.onreadystatechange  function       console.logstate   xhr.readyState       Listen to the upload progress.   xhr.upload.onprogress  functione  console.loguploading...    xhr.setRequestHeaderContentType, videowebm   xhr.sendblob  codepre  pIt works well, because the Blob reaches the Servlet where I use this bit of code to process itp  precodebyte[] buffer  new byte[16  1024]  InputStream input  request.getInputStream        OutputStream output  new FileOutputStreamcostam0.webm int bytesRead while bytesRead  input.readbuffer  1     System.out.printlnbytesRead     output.writebuffer, 0, bytesRead  output.close input.close codepre  pIt saves the file as well.p  pThe issue I do have is that it is very very slow, according to my calculations it can process about 42kBs, which for a web service having to do with video files is extremely slow. I have been sitting here for hours trying to find a way to speed it up somehow, or to at least find the bottleneck, but unfortunately I have no idea where it might be.p  pMy suspicion is that the browser is causing the lag, I have used a different InputStream in my Servlet leading to a local file the same one Im trying to upload through XHR and it had no issue processing it at all, took less than a second. The server is stationed on my localhost, so I dont think the network is lagging me much at all.p  pIf anyone had this issue before, Id be grateful for any pointers.p

Negative 1477 pI thought I would share this with other users as it does not appear to be something that is covered but may help some people working with tables and data.  Also Any suggestions on some better code would be greatly appreciated.  I tried to make this as simple and streamligned as possible.  I wrote this code after hours of trying to find a super simple solution to use tds in a table as a datasource.  DataTables just did not cut it as there was just to much bulk. I needed something super efficient that allowed me to use data from essentially any table and any column I choose and I knew the specific tdcolumn I wanted it from. This should essentially allow you to use any table with a specific column to pull data right out and populate it to an array.  Which you can then use globally.p  pI hope this helps anyone looking to use table as a true data source.p  pBest Regards Devprocbp
Negative 1477 pI am implementing an Android application for NFC devices.

Any idea why The problem occurs on any marketed application as on mine and regardless of the tag having an actual NDEF message or not.p

Negative 1477 pIm using VLD to detect memory leaks in a game Im writing in C. It reported no leaks at all until very recently. I have a SettingsManager class all static methods which loads settings and can save them file IO. Heres how I would load a list of keyvalue settings into a vectorp  precodestdvectorltSettinggt settings SettingsManagerloadFromFilesettingsLocation  display  settingsExtension, settings codepre  pThis vector is correctly filled and I can further process the data. The loadFromFile method is implemented as followsp  precodestdifstream file file.openfilename iffile.isopen      stdstring line     unsigned pos     whilefile.good              Setting s  new Setting         getlinefile, line         ifline.empty                       do not read empty lines             continue                   parse to Setting         pos  line.find         sgtkey  line.substr0, pos         sgtvalue  line.substrpos  1          add to vector         settings.pushbacks          file.close     return true  else      return false  codepre  pSo, this allocates Settings which is a simple struct with two stdstring variables. I delete them from where I call the loadFromFile method with the following method callp  precodeSettingsManagerdeleteSettingssettings codepre  pwhich is implemented as followsp  precodevoid SettingsManagerdeleteSettingsstdvectorltSettinggtamp settings      forstdvectorltSettinggtiterator it  settings.begin it  settings.end it                  delete it       codepre  pWhen I debug, after the deleteSettings call all the elements in the vector are Bad Ptrs Visual Studio 2010 Express.

Negative 1477 pUnder certain circumstances, I get an NRE when closing a form using its Close button, which simply calls the native WinForms Close method.p  pCertain paths through the code do fine, but one particular path causes the Null Reference Exception. Since this is nominally a scenario where something that is null is being referenced, how could this be taking place when the form is simply being closed I can imagine there being a memory leak, perhaps, but something null being referenced Im not understanding.p  pWhat potential causes in the code might there bep  h2UPDATEh2  pAnswer to Jon Skeetp  pIm unable to debug this in the normal way for reasons boring and laborious to relate again, but what I can do is thisp  precodecatch Exception ex      MessageBox.Showex.Message     MessageBox.Showex.InnerException.ToString     SSCS.ExceptionHandlerex, frmEntry.saveDSD  codepre  pThe last is an internalcustom exception processing method.p  pAll I get from these lines isp  precodeNull Reference Exception Nothing empty string Exception NullReferenceException Location frmEntry.btnSave.click codepre  pNote that the last exception shown now implicates btnSave.click as the culprit, whereas it formerly pointed the finger at saveDSD. Curiouser and curiouser. Is this a case of the Hawthorne Effect in action well, a modified Hawthorne Effect, in the sense that adding this debugging code might be changing things.p  ul liThe canonical Hawthorne Effect being more like this sort of scenario A bunch of cats are playing basketball. Some girls walk up and watch. The cats start showing off and hotdogging, and one breaks his leg. Is it the girls fault No. Would it have happened had they not been watching No.li ul  h2UPDATE 2h2  pTalk about the Hawthorne Effect When I copied the two MessageBox.Show calls to the catch block of frmEntry.btnSave.click, I then gotp  precodeNull Reference Exception Null Reference Exception Exception NullReferenceException Location frmEntry.Closing codepre  pIOW, the location of the NRE keeps moving about, like a squirrel on a country road when [h,sh]e meets two cars going opposite directions.p  h2UPDATE 3h2  pAnd it happened once more adding those MessageBox.Shows to the forms Closing event causes the NRE to pop up out of a different hole and declare itself.

Thus, not only does cancelled emsoundem like a bool, it acts like a bool, too. Why was it not emdeclaredem as a boolp  pThe official image of this codebase should be Edvard Munchs The Screamp  h2UPDATE 5h2  pMaybe Im venting, but recent experiences have caused me to come up with a new name for certain types of code, and an illustration for many projects. Code that doesnt go anywhere, but simply takes up space assignments made, but are then not acted on, or empty methodshandlers called I now call Winchester Mystery House code.p  pAnd for the typical project Ive been a captured employee as well as a contractor on many projects now, having almost 20 years experience in programming, I now liken the situation to a group of people wallowing in quicksand. When they hire new people to come aboard, they really want them to jump into the quicksand with them. How is this going to help matters Is it just a case of misery loves company What they should be doing is saying Throw us a rope not Come on in, the quicksand is finep  pMany times its probably just entropy and job security at play if they keep wrestling with the monstrosity theyve chosen or created, their hardwon knowledge in how to keep the beast moreorless at bay will keep them in their semicomfy job. If they make any radical changes most teams emdoem need to make some radical improvements, IMO, this may endanger their employment status. Maybe the answer is to employcontract transition teams to move teamscompanies from prehistoric dinosaurclubbing times into the 21st Century, training the old guard so that they can preserve their jobs. After all, there arent enough of these saviors to steal the old hands jobs anyway  train them up, get them up to speed, and move on. All would benefit. But many seemingly prefer to continue wallowing in the mire, or quicksand.p  pBefore anybody hires a programmer, they should give them at the minimum a test wherein passing the test would prove that they are at least familiar with the basic tenets delineated in Steve McConnells Code Complete.p  pOkay, back to battling the quicksand...p  h2UPDATE 6h2  pOr Refactoring Spodeeodeep  pA gotcha with refactoring is if you change the name of a variable such as thisp  precodeChangeListType chgLst  ChangeListType is an enum codepre  p...to thisp  precodeChangeListType changeListType codepre  p...and if there is a data table with a column named chgLst, SQL statements can also get changed, which can ruin, if not your day, at least part of it.p  pAnother potential gotcha is when you get, [var name] is only assigned but its value is never used hints. You may think you can just cavalierly 86 all of these, but beware that any related code which you may comment out along with assignments to these dead vars is not producing reliedupon side effects. Admittedly, this would be a bad way to code side effectual methods storing their return vals in vars that are ignored, but ... it happens, especially when the original coder was a propellerhead mad scientist cowboy.p  pThis code is so chock full of antipatterns that I wouldnt be surprised if Butterick andor Simplicity put out a contract on this guy.p  pOn second thought, aside from the architecture, design, coding, and formatting of this project, its not really emallem that bad...p  pMary Shelleys Frankenstein was very prescient indeed, but not in the way most people have thought. Rather than a general foreboding about technology run amok, it is much more specific than that it is a foregleam of most modern software projects, where pieces parts from here and there are jammed together willynilly with little regard to whether the hip bones connected to the thigh bone or should be and whether those parts match up or will reject one another the left hand doesnt know what the right is doing, and devil take the hindmost Etc.p
Negative 1477 pI am just wondering if there is any locking policy in C11 which would prevent threads from starvation.p  pI have a bunch of threads which are competing for one mutex. Now, my problem is that the thread which is leaving a critical section starts immediately compete for the same mutex and most of the time wins. Therefore other threads waiting on the mutex are starving. p  pI do not want to let the thread, leaving a critical section, sleep for some minimal amount of time to give other threads a chance to lock the mutex.p  pI thought that there must be some parameter which would enable fair locking for threads waiting on the mutex but I wasnt able to find any appropriate solution.p  pWell I found stdthisthreadyield function, which suppose to reschedule the order of threads execution, but it is only hint to scheduler thread and depends on scheduler thread implementation if it reschedule the threads or not.p  pIs there any way how to provide fair locking policy for the threads waiting on the same mutex in C11 What are the usual strategiesp  pThanksp

Negative 1477 pI have developed an app for iOs and Android with Sencha Touch. Now i want bring these app to Windows Phone 8.p  pI migrated the framework to 2.2 and all works fine. In the internet explorer 10 on Windows 8 the app works great. But when i try to open the app on the windows phone with the browser, the app crashes alway on the same action.p  pI used a card layout and destroy the last view manually, because i made better experiences with this procedure.p  pIm reale desperate, because i dont know where i can fix it. Unfortunately, there is no developer console like in chrome. From my manully bugfixing i know that the javascript code works till the and of the called function.p  pI also try the app as build with PhoneGap and there are the same problems.p  pDoes any body know, if there are some problems with a Ext.Js container in card layout and windows phone 8p  pAnd additional, does any body know a good way to check HTMLCSSJavascript Code on the Windows Phone 8 Maybe on the same way like on the iPad.p

Negative 1477 pim using Mac OS X Snow Leopard and IBMs DB2. I have it up and running, i already imported a schema.sql and can manipulate the database via SQLCommands. For connecting to the db in java i need the jdbc Driver from IBM, so i googled it and downloaded the correct version from this site a hrefhttpwww01.ibm.comsupportdocview.wssuidswg21363866 relnofollowhttpwww01.ibm.comsupportdocview.wssuidswg21363866ap  pThen i extracted it and pasted the db2jcc.jar into my Eclipse Projects Folder. I configured my Buildpath and now it is listed as an Referenced Library. FYI This is a exercise from college. So we were then adviced to copypaste this class a hrefhttppastebin.com3GYXdnxu relnofollowhttppastebin.com3GYXdnxua I did that and wrote a main method calling for openConnection. Now i am gettingp  precode java.lang.ClassNotFoundException COM.ibm.db2.jdbc.app.DB2Driver codepre  pMy password, as well as my username are correct. What am I doing wrong. Do i need to set some kind of classpath on Mac OS Xp

Negative 1477 pI am integrating iAds into an iOS 6 app with a UITabBarController and UINavigationController and a bunch of UITableViewbased screens and have it mostly working with one glaring exception. When I navigate from a parent to child view controller, my banner view does not appear until the ADBannerView delegate methods are invoked when a new ad is served even if I already have an ad.p  pWhat I want is when I have an ad displayed on the parent and click to the child, I want the ad to appear immediately.

I am sure it is something trivial I am not doing, but am stuck. Helpp  pAs I put in the comments, it seems to be that the contentView frame size is incorrect at the point where the code is placing the ad in the view. With autolayout off, it places the ad correct initially, but with each new ad, the banner moves up the screen. With autolayout on, the initial display of the ad is in the wrong place, but subsequent calls or rotation calls the ad is in the correct location. p  pHere is the relevant codep  pI have a singleton class that manages the creation of the ADBannerView instance I want to share.

Negative 1477 pIm currently writing a little RESTful api for a tomcat server using the jenkins api. In order to return a json string, im using the jackson api and create the output string via an ObjectMapper.p  pTo keep needed resources low, im thinking about making the ObjectMapper a static object either one mapper for each RESTclass, or in a singelton.

Negative 1477 pI have a report displaying rows with text fields with variable length I use the Can Grow option. I use a Box for the details. My problem is that when the last text field cannot fit into to the box on the bottom of the page, a empty space is left, and the new row begins on next page. Unchecking the option Keep Object Together on the fields, didnt solve the problem and if it did I dont want the content of the text field to break across pages. My question is Is it possible to autoresize box height depending on rows content, so I can avoid empty spaces at the bottom on every page doesnt look very nice. Thanks in advance.p

The StepInput has an optional child Step, and the Step has an optional parent Step self referencing.p  pThis works as expected. What I want to be able to do now is to delete a Step, and have all of the StepInputs associated with that Step also be deleted, as well as any child steps and their inputs.p  pI am using Entity Framework 5. Is there a convenient way to do this with EF, or do I need to create a Stored Procedure, set cascade options on my FK constraints, or is there something else that would be a better solutionp  pI did try using ON DELETE CASCADE in various ways, but nothing I tried worked. I also read that you shouldnt rely on cascading deletes when it comes to hierarchical data, but didnt really understand the alternatives that were suggested CTEsp  pWould it make things simpler if I nixed the ParentStepId column Its only real utility now is to determine if the step is a toplevel step, which I can probably just as easily use a bit field for. There are no parentchild relationships that dont involve a StepInput in between.p  pI am obviously pretty green when it comes to SQL in general and SQL Server in particular, so bear that in mind with your answers p

Negative 1477 pThis feels like it should be simple.  I have a .HTML file stored on my computer, and Id like to read the entire file into a string.

I only get the first few lines  I know the immediate window cuts off, but thats not the issue.  Im definitely not getting the whole file into my string.  I also tried using an alternative method using the file system object, and got similar results, only this time with lots of weird characters and question marks thrown in.  This makes me think its probably some kind of encoding issue. Although frankly, I dont fully understand what that means.  I know there are different encoding formats and that this can cause issues with string parsing, but thats about it.p  pSo more generally, heres what Id really like to know  How can I use vba to open a file of any extension that can be viewed in a text editor and length thats doesnt exceed VBAs string limit, and be sure that whatever characters I would see in a basic text editor are what gets read into a string  If that cant be easily done, Id certainly appreciate being pointed towards a method thats likely to work with .html files  Thanks so much for your helpp  pEDIT Heres an example of what happens when I use the suggested method.

Negative 1477 pIm a new programmer at a software house, and lets just say I cant make too much modification that includes a major changes, for example like adding library. In the current project, were using JSP and Servlet, and some other advanced GUI that I never knew they said its a derivative of Eclipse, called Enfinity. The Enfinity also hides the libraries under obscure locations, and its very different than in Java. So I dont think I will able to understand about the library location too, moreover adding some new library.p  pThe problem here, I need to escape HTML characters like amp, lt, , , and , but when I search solution on the internet, usually the solution involves using JSTL  cout or fnescapeXML  or importing a library Springs HTMLEscape, or Apaches StringEscapeUtils. JQuery, on the other hand, is imported, but sadly, not related to solution. But the problem is JSTL is not part of the library readily imported into the project. Java, JSP, and Servlet are kinda new to me, as I didnt get Java at all in my college, so I dont know either what library is standard in JSP already present, without I have to add it physically. I dont even know whether the Apaches StringEscapeUtils is present or not. Do you have any suggestion  codes on how I should escape the HTML characters under my circumstances Thank you very much.p

However when i implemented his code it my project i ended up with null pointer exceptions and after fiddling with his code I ended up back were i started with the same out of memory error.  So can anybody direct me to someone who can show me how to have as many backgrounds as i want with out running out of memory. Or does android  as great as it is does not let you simply use more than a certain amount of backgrounds helpp

When it comes to adding 400 new lines, raising an exception at loop 399 and discarding all the previous 398 lines would be extremely undesirable for me.p  pI understand that batching would be the best choice concerning performance, but this is a background routine, so Im not worried about it. p  pBottomline is there a way to actually force django to update the database on every iterationp

Negative 1477 pI have a sandbox that simply refuses to run test code.p  pI wrote some simple apex in a trial org, and after it was activated purchased the code became inactive. Thus, I span up a sandbox and finished things off, writing some simple test coverage to allow me to deploy the class and trigger to production. I have made sure in the sandbox that the class and trigger were restored to active status.p  pIssue is  I try to run test coverage, it instantly tells me the request is queued, but that 00 Test Methods have passed. The status of the queued request remains at Selected Job is not yet complete forever more. The more I try to run the test class, the more Im cheerily told Selected Job is not yet complete, and it never completes.p  pHas anyone seen this, or heard of possible solution..

Negative 1477 pI have an issue with FirefoxChrome under Android.p  pWhen I type text into an input box see code below, the onkeypress, onkeyup, and onkeydown events are not fired when typing letters, but when typing  sign or pressing the space bar for example, it does.p  pIn the Android preinstalled browser everything woks fine.p  pAnother very rare thing, the behaviour is different if my cursor is not the last character...

Negative 1477 pI use adjustPan to automatically pan my application to make the EditText field visible when the softkeyboard appears. So far this has worked well but in the latest Android 4.4 Kitkat versions the actionbar pans up as usual but a white box is left behind. Ive tried debugging this with the Eclipse View Hierarchy tool but it ignores the box. Ive also experimented with v19 styling with no luck. This happens on a variety of Kitkat Nexus devices and emulators.p  pIm happy to leave the actionbar on screen or remove it completely when the windows pans. Any help would be appreciated removing the box.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com6v2YY.png altenter image description herep

Negative 1477 pI have a dilema which Im unsure how to approach right now. I know that JQuery needs to have a unique set of IDs to be called in the document ready function. I go through PHP and read my mysql table to print out these HTML forms and with each form is a button that will add a new item to this table. p  pThe issue here is that I cannot have an idea of how many forms there will be so I would like to write the JQuery code so that it can dynamically read anytime that the button is clicked, but know which button was clicked so that the proper IDs can pass. p  pIve seen some examples but they have more to do with CSS styling, are there any ideas or thoughts as to how this problem could be remedied p
Negative 1477 pI made this algorithm, i was debugging it to see why it wasnt working, but then i started getting weird stuff while printing arrays at the end of each cycle to see where the problem first occurred. At a first glance, it seemed my while cycles didnt take into consideration the last array value, but i dunno... all info about algorithm and everything is in the source. What id like to understand is, primarily, the answer to this question Why does the output change sometimes If i run the program, 6070 of the time i get answer 14 which should be wrong, but some other times i get weird stuff as the result...why how can i debug the code if i keep getting different results....plus, if i compile for release and not debug running codeblocks under latest gcc available in debian sid here, i get most of the times 9 as result.p  pCODEp  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltvectorgt void printarray      stdcoutltlt       for int i  0 i lt n i  stdcoutltltarray[i]ltlt       stdcoutltltltltstdendl     this algorithm must take an array of elements and return the maximum achievable sum within any of the subarrays or subsegments of the array the sum must be composed of adjacent numbers within the array  it will squeeze the array ......positive numbers......negative numbers......positive numbers...... into ...positive numbernegative numberpositive number...  then it will remove any negative numbers in case it would be convienent so that the sum between 2 positive numbers separated by 1 negative number would result in the highest achievable number, like this   3,4,4 if u do remove the negative number in order to unite the positive ones, i will get 3443. So it would  be better not to remove the negative number, and let 4 be the highest number achievable, without any sums   3,1,4 in this case removing 1 will result in 3146, 6 is bigger than both 3 and 4, so it would be convienent to remove the  negative number and sum all of the three up into one number so what this step does is shrink the array furthermore if it is possible to remove any negatives in a smart way i also make it reiterate for as long as there is no more shrinking available, because if you think about it not always can the pc know if, after a shrinking has occured, there are more shrinkings to be done  then, lastly, it will calculate which of the positive numbers left is highest, and it will choose that as remaining maximum sum   expected result for the array of input, s[], would be i think, 7  int main  const int n4 int s[n1]3,2,4,4,6 int k[n1]0 PRINT ARRAY, FOR DEBUG stdcoutltlt       for int i  0 i lt n i  stdcoutltltk[i]ltlt       stdcoutltltltltstdendl int i0, j0  step 1 compress negative and postive subsegments of array s[] into single numbers within array k[] while iltn      while s[i]gt0              k[j]s[i] i          j     while s[i]lt0              k[j]s[i] i          j   while iltn       while s[i]gt0              if igtn break         k[j]s[i] i          j     while s[i]lt0              if igtn break         k[j]s[i] i          j                 stdcoutltltSTEP 1   PRINT ARRAY, FOR DEBUG stdcoutltlt       for int i  0 i lt n i  stdcoutltltk[i]ltlt       stdcoutltltltltstdendl    j0  step 2 remove negative numbers when handy stdcoutltltchecked WRONG ltltunsignedk[3]ltltstdendl int p1 while p0      p0     while jltn              stdcoutltltchecked right ltltunsignedk[j1]ltltstdendl         if k[j]lt0  j continue         if  k[j]gtunsignedk[j1] ampamp k[j2]gtunsignedk[j1]                       stdcoutltltchecked rightltltstdendl             k[j2]k[j]k[j1]k[j2]             k[j]0 k[j1]0             p                  j2       stdcoutltltSTEP 2   PRINT ARRAY, FOR DEBUG stdcoutltlt       for int i  0 i lt n i  stdcoutltltk[i]ltlt       stdcoutltltltltstdendl   j0 i0 i will now use i and p variables for completely different purposes, as not to waste memory  i will be final value that algorithm needed to find  p will be a value to put within i if it is the biggest number found yet, it will keep changing as i go through the array....   step 3 check which positive number is bigger IT IS THE MAX ACHIEVABLE SUM while jltn      ifk[j]lt0  j continue      pk[j] if pgti  stdswapp,i      j2   stdcoutltltstdendlltltMAX ACHIEVABLE SUM WITHIN SUBSEGMENTS OF ARRAY  ltltiltltstdendl  return 0  codepre  pmight there be problems because im not using vectors Thanks for your helpp  pstrongEDITstrong i found both my algorithm bugs one is the one mentioned by user m24p, found in step 1 of the algorithm, which i fixed with a kindaugly getaround which ill get to cleaning up later... the other is found in step2. it seems that in the while expression check, where i check something against unsigned values of the array, what is really checked is that something agains unsigned values of some weird numbers. i tested it, with simple cout output IF i do unsignedk[anyindexofk] and the value contained in that spot is a positive number, i get the positive number of course which is unsigned IF that number is negative though, the value wont be simply unsigned, but look very different, like i stepped over the array or something...i get this number 4294967292 when im instead expecting 2 to return as 2 or 4 to be 4. that number is for 4, 2 gives 4294967294p  pI edited the sources with my new stuff, thanks for the helpp  pstrongEDIT 2strong nvm i resolved with stdabs using cmath libs of c would there have been any other ways without using absp

Negative 1477 pI am generating XML data using a PHP script on an IIS 7 server with PHP 5.4.21. I noticed the data was not passing XML validation because seemingly random tags would have their lt or lt stripped from them. I ran some tests to see what the problem is by putting the expected XML output in a 2 separate files, one with a .php extension with no actual PHP in it and one with a .xml extension exact same content of the .php file but this will not have to pass through the PHP interpreter. The .xml extension file did not have any characters disappear while the .php extension file did. Then running the same PHP script on my local WAMP server worked fine as well. This all leads me to assume that the issue must be with PHP. The problem is I have no clue why it is happening and I have so far been unsuccessful in searching Google for an answer.p  pHere is a code sample that causes the bug so you can get a bette idea of what is happening.p  precodeltphp     print ltxml version1.0gtn     print ltappguidegtn     print tltwheelsgtn      for i  0 i lt 80 i          print ttltwheelgtn         print tttltsomeonegtiltsomeonegtn         print tttltsetgtiltsetgtn         print tttltusgtiltusgtn         print tttltupgtiltupgtn         print tttltthegtiltthegtn         print tttltbombgtiltbombgtn         print ttltwheelgtn           print tltwheelsgtn     print ltappguidegtn gt codepre  pThis should simply print the same data 80 times within the ltwheels section.

Negative 1477 pOk, here is my confusionproblemp  ol liI develop in localhost and there you could raise exceptions and could see the logs in command line easily.li liThen I deploy the code on test, stage and production server, that is where the problem begins, it is not easy to see logs or debug errors and exceptions. For normal errors I guess djangotoolbar could be enabled, but I do get some silent exceptions which dont crash but the process manipulates to failure because of that. For example, I have payment integration, and few days ago the payments were failing on return callback on our site, but nothing was crashing, just that payment process failed message was coming, but the payment gateway vendor was working fine, then I had to look for some failure instances which could lead to this problem and figured out that one db save operation was not saving because the variable was not there.li ol  pNow my question, is Sentry a hrefhttpsgithub.comgetsentrysentry relnofollowhttpsgithub.comgetsentrysentrya an answer for that Or is there any other option for thisp  pPlease do ask if any further clarification is needed for my requirement.p
Negative 1477 pI am trying to mess around with file input in C, mainly with integer values in a matrix format. For instance, if I have a file like...p  precode4 5 7 3 6 8 5 2 5 7 3 4 9 4 8 7 codepre  pI am confused as to what the EOF command will do. I know I can use it to check for end of file, but what if I wanted to test the end of a row What if I wanted to print the diagonal right to left  so 3,5,7,9 . I know I would have to go row by row, set a counter that counts at each iteration to find the length of the rows, print out the last value of that row, then deduct the pointer by 1 and go onto the next row. But how can I do this As in, is EOF only for the file as a whole, or is there a C command that can more directly define row lengths and such. p
Negative 1477 pI am facing a puzzle, im testing some scripts on my wamp installation. When i do a echo dated and i run the script from the browser i see the correct week day, by example, lets say it echo Mon, but.. when i execute it from a batch file, the echo shows the next day, by example Tue, why this can be happening I have the correct timezone in my php.ini the windows clock as well, i dont have a clue why this is happening. In the same puzzle, i have a path to a dbconnect file, again, from browser it run ok, but from the batch file it dont find the included path, i solved it writing the full windows path Cpathtofile.php but i dont understand why, the include is done by the php file executed by the batch file, so the path should be ok rightp  pIf someone can share some lights i would appreciate it. p

Negative 1477 pThe contextbr It is necessary for me to fetch the URL from the server when the user clicks the link. It is not available beforehand. The click on the link should work as normal, but  with that fetched URL.p  pThe procedure is as followsp  ul liThe link contains codehrefcode before it is clickedli liThe link is clickedli liI hook into the click with codengmousedowncode or codengclickcode, and fetch the URL from the server using a codehttpcode request.li liThe href of the link is updated with the URL.li liThe original click should complete with that new url, not the codecode placeholder.li ul  pThe problem comes on the last step. Since the codehttpcode request is asynchronous, I suspect there is a timing issue. My suspicion is If the server request is fast enough, it will go through, and the URL is changed before the original click goes through. If not, then the original click goes through and tries to go to the  placeholder URL. So nothing will happen when clicking the link.p  pI want to make the original click wait for the result of the codehttpcode request to have returned with the URL. The reason the original click is important is that it could either be a left or a middle mouse button click cmdclick, and I dont know which one, so itd be hard to call it myself from the javascript.p  pSo, any clever ideas on how can make the original click go through with the fetched URLp

Is there any better way I can cache the data populated once the application is opened and populate it when a user selects codeALLcode codeRadio Buttoncode later when he needs itp  pstrongC Codestrongp  precodesqlcon  GetConnectionString             try                              sqlcon.Open                  var sw  Stopwatch.StartNew                  for int i  0 i lt dgvPaymentsReceivedCollections.RowCount i                                      int trademonth  Convert.ToInt32dgvPaymentsReceivedCollections.Rows[i].HeaderCell.Value                       for int j  0 j lt dgvPaymentsReceivedCollections.ColumnCount j                                              int paymentmonth  Convert.ToInt32dgvPaymentsReceivedCollections.Columns[j].HeaderCell.Value                          var sw  Stopwatch.StartNew                          SqlCommand cmdPaymentsReceived  new SqlCommand                          cmdPaymentsReceived.Connection  sqlcon                         cmdPaymentsReceived.CommandType  CommandType.StoredProcedure                         cmdPaymentsReceived.CommandText  spPaymentsRecevedCollections                          cmdPaymentsReceived.Parameters.Addnew SqlParametertrademonth, trademonth                         cmdPaymentsReceived.Parameters.Addnew SqlParameterpaymentmonth, paymentmonth                           SqlDataAdapter daPaymentsReceivedCollections  new SqlDataAdapter                         DataTable dtPaymentsReceivedColletions  new DataTable                          daPaymentsReceivedCollections.SelectCommand  cmdPaymentsReceived                         daPaymentsReceivedCollections.FilldtPaymentsReceivedColletions                          sw.Stop                         MessageBox.Showsw.ElapsedMilliseconds.ToString                          dgvPaymentsReceivedCollections.Rows[i].Cells[j].Value  dtPaymentsReceivedColletions.Rows[0][0].ToString                                                         sqlcon.Close              codepre  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comSNKj2.png altenter image description herep

Negative 1477 pWhile working on implementing Googles codeCast SDKcode into an iOS application, I ran into this issue and wasnt able to come up with a scalable, efficient solution, but figure someone way smarter than me must be able to give me a few ideasp  pGoogles Chromecast iOS SDK comes with a codeGCKDeviceScannercode class which manages the discovery of available cast receivers ie. Chromecast HDMI dongles. In order to develop against that, its obviously best to be in a room with a Chromecast plugged into an poweredon TV.p  pHowever, that may not always be possible nor does relying on available network resources make code easily testable. To solve, I created codeMockGCKDeviceScannercode a subclass of codeGCKDeviceScannercode and overwrote applicable methods to return me emfake receiver devicesem for developmenttesting. Now I am able to continue coding even though no physical receivers may be available.p  pBut I found integration into my actual classes rather cumbersome. In the example above, I have a p  precodeproperty nonatomic, strong GCKDeviceScanner scanner codepre  pBut then, upon actual initialization Im doing this rather ugly workaroundp  precodeifdef kDevMode scanner  [[MockGCKDeviceScanner alloc] init] else scanner  [[GCKDeviceScanner alloc] init] endif codepre  pThat just doesnt look nice... and makes my code really cumbersome to read. Whats the emrightem way of doing such a thingp

Negative 1477 pOver two years ago, a hrefhttpchannel9.msdn.comEventsGoingNativeGoingNative2012STL11MagicSecrets relnofollowStephan T. Lavavej described a spacesaving optimizationa he implemented in Microsofts implementation of codestdmakesharedcode, and I know from speaking with him that Microsoft has nothing against other library implementations adopting this optimization. If you know for sure whether other libraries e.g., for Gnu C, Clang, Intel C, plus Boost for codeboostmakesharedcode have adopted this implementation, please contribute an answer. I dont have ready access to that many codemakesharedcode implementations, nor am I wild about digging into the bowels of the ones I have to see if theyve implemented the WKWYL optimization, but Im hoping that SO readers know the answers for some libraries offhand. I know from looking at the code that as of Boost 1.52, the WKWYL optimization had not been implemented, but Boost is now up to version 1.55.p  pNote that this optimization is different from codestdmakesharedcodes ability to avoid a dedicated heap allocation for the reference count used by codestdsharedptrcode. For a discussion of the difference between WKWYL and that optimication, consult a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14342159doesthewkwyloptimazioninmakesharedintroduceapenaltyforsomemultitthis questiona.p

Short of using public fields being bad practice, are there any negative implications to using public readonly fields this wayp  pNote, were talking about value types only. Arrays, for example would expose elements to be overwritten by calling code.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pThanks for all the input. It seems that there is no downside to using codepublic readonlycode fields for cases like this where databinding, etc. is not used. In my benchmarks, execution time dropped by 70 which is a big deal. Targeting .NET 4, I would have expected the compiler to inline getteronly properties. The benchmarks were of course tested in release configuration without the debugger attached.p

Negative 1477 pI am updating my app to use a Content Provider and a CursorLoader in place of using startManagingCursor.p  pI have 2 tables in my sqlite database, table errors and table messages. When i start the activities that show the contents of these tables in a listview, everything seems to work fine.p  pOne thing i have noticed is that when i call the viewMessages Activity the Case statement that is matching the URI in the content provider is getting called twice.p  pThis does not happen when a call viewPhoneNumbers activity.p  pIt seems like i am calling the following twicep  precodecursorLoader  new CursorLoaderthis, RR3ContentProvider.CONTENTURIMESSAGES, projection, null, null, null codepre  pIll show the logging statements first so you can see what i mean. It logs CASE Messages twice, but when i do the same for the phone table it just logs Case PHONES only once, which i think it should only do it once.p  pCan anyone tell me why the CASE MESSAGES is executing twicep  precode0722 101711.845 EViewMessagesActivityAsync10808 inside ViewMessagesActivityAsync oncreate 0722 101711.845 ERR3ContentProvider10808 inside RR3ContentProvider query method 0722 101711.845 ERR3ContentProvider10808 CASE MESSAGES 0722 101711.845 ERR3ContentProvider10808 About to do the query method in content provider 0722 101711.855 EViewMessagesActivityAsync10808 inside3 onCreateLoader in ViewMessagesActivityAsync 0722 101711.855 ERR3ContentProvider10808 inside RR3ContentProvider query method 0722 101711.855 ERR3ContentProvider10808 CASE MESSAGES 0722 101711.855 ERR3ContentProvider10808 About to do the query method in content provider 0722 101711.915 VPhoneStatusBar1219 setLightsOntrue 0722 101711.945 EViewMessagesActivityAsync10808 inside myadapter getview for messages 0722 101711.945 EViewMessagesActivityAsync10808 CursorgetItemposition  android.content.ContentResolverCursorWrapperInner67a0e5b8position  0 0722 101711.945 EViewMessagesActivityAsync10808 inside myadapter getview for messages 0722 101711.945 EViewMessagesActivityAsync10808 CursorgetItemposition  android.content.ContentResolverCursorWrapperInner67a0e5b8position  1 0722 101711.955 EViewMessagesActivityAsync10808 inside myadapter getview for messages 0722 101711.955 EViewMessagesActivityAsync10808 CursorgetItemposition  android.content.ContentResolverCursorWrapperInner67a0e5b8position  2 codepre  p.p  precode0722 101721.345 EViewPhoneNumberAsync10808 inside ViewPhoneNumberAsync onCreate 0722 101721.345 ERR3ContentProvider10808 inside RR3ContentProvider query method 0722 101721.345 ERR3ContentProvider10808 CASE PHONES 0722 101721.345 ERR3ContentProvider10808 About to do the query method in content provider 0722 101721.405 VPhoneStatusBar1219 setLightsOntrue 0722 101721.425 EViewPhoneNumberAsync10808 inside myadapter getview 0722 101721.435 EViewPhoneNumberAsync10808 inside myadapter getview codepre  p.

Negative 1477 pI create a MFC ActiveX control with some interface methods in VS2012, and these methods work well. When I add some new methods to the ActiveX today , strongi can see the new methodsstrong in activex control test container, but strongi cant call themstrongcall methods and nothing happened. This also happened in IE11 when i trying to call the method with JS. The breakpoints in these new methods will never be reached. The old methods behave normally, and i add the new methods in the same manner. I dont know how to figure it, can anyone help me Thanks a lot.

Lets say we have file input with linesp  precodehello world store these lines but only enough memory to store these particular lines then print out these lines in reverse make sure to keep track of the line count,and character count this is a 6th line so double the space of the array to store 10 lines codepre  pmy psuedocode dash means general instruction, is a bit more detailed p  precoderead file in from stdin     begin index count for the stringarray     we can assume line will fit into 1000 bytes       buffer[1000]     allocate memory to store 5 adresses of strings       char stringarray  malloc5  sizeofchar     begin reading file       whilefgetsbuffer,sizeofbuffer,stdin  NULL store each line in buffer into the array     allocate only enough space to store the particular line,not sure how to do this but..       stringarray[index]  mallocstrlenbuffer  sizeofchar afraid buffer will be 1000 like intialized     add characters of line to character sum and add the line to linesum       charactersum  charactersum  strlenbuffer       linesum  linesum  1     fill the array index with each line string       strcpystringarray[index],buffer     increment index codepre  pone thing i have no clue on is how to realocate space for the stringarray because eventually it will need more space then to store 5 adresses. im thinking..p  precodestringarray  reallocstringarray, 2sizeofstringarray codepre  pbut how do i check if my array has no more room to store string addresses in order to realloc and where would i place it Is this method feasible im hoping im using malloc and realloc correctly with no match errors because i have trouble with those. The printings, i can do fine but im more concerned about meeting the dynamic allocation requirements correctly and building the array correctly p

Negative 1477 pIm having a really weird issue with depth testing here. Im rendering a simple mesh in an OpenGL 3.3 core profile context on Windows, with depth testing enabled and glDepthFunc set to GLLESS. On my machine a laptop with a nVidia Geforce GTX 660M, everything is working as expected, the depth test is working, this is what it looks likep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com1boXS.png altenter image description herep  pNow, if I run the program on a different PC, a tower with a Radeon R9 280, it looks more like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comJAJX1.png altenter image description herep  pStrange enough, the really weird thing is that when I call glEnableGLDEPTHTEST every frame before drawing, the result is correct on both machines. As its working when I do that, I figure the depth buffer is correctly created on both machines, it just seems that the depth test is somehow being disabled before rendering when I enable it only once at initialization.

Negative 1477 pI am doing a fun little project, making a kind of secret code program with a GUITkinter to encrypt my textnot very securely. I am trying to make a password on this program linked to a txt file. The program has default password abc, stored in a text file in sha224. When the user enters abc, it will hash their input in sha224, and compare it to the stored password in hexutf2.txt. Once they have logged in, the user will have the option to choose a new password by clicking New Passcode, entering their previous passcode, clicking next, and then clicking new code. After clicking new code, the user enters a new passcode in the entrypassVariable, then clicks enter passcode, which will write the new passcode on the txt file. Instead, the program hangs on the first pressing of Enter passcode, despite the fact that I had entered abc the default passcode. The program worked before I added the password element, so I will post only the password code here, but I will link to the entire program if anyone wants to see it.p  pstrongemEDITemstrongp  pPosting just the essential code here.

Negative 1477 pFollowing Scenario There are rows for the following tablecolumns, which have long string values.

Negative 1477 pI have a compiler for a domain specific language that outputs a .net dll that can then be used to do whatever the DSL said it should. It works well under .net but now I need to make the compiled dll functionality accessible from Java. The interface changes depending on the DSL, much like it would if I was implementing an F type provider.p  pIdeally, I would like something along the lines of Reflection.Emit except that it would generate Java bytecode. It is important that the enduser can debug their Java code that uses my generated library from a Java GUI, so I dont think I can just use IKVM to instead include the Java code in .net. I also cannot use a commercial product such as JNBridge because all the users would need to install it, and call it every time their DSL code changes.p  pIs there a better solution than generating a .java file in text format and compiling it with a Java compiler The .java file would just be a lightweight interface talking to the .net dll over some IPC mechanism perhaps a named pipe, and its purpose would be to provide a typesafe interface similar to what would be seen from a .net application except with indexers, getters, setters, overloads, etc replaced with some sort of horribly verbose syntax. Many thanks.p

The following are function strongHashstrong and strongFindstrongp  precodeIndex Hash ElementType Key, int TableSize       return Key  TableSize   Position FindElementType Key, HashTable H      Position CurrentPos     int CollisionNum      CollisionNum  0     CurrentPos  HashKey, HgtTableSize     whileHgtTheCells[CurrentPos].Info  Empty ampamp HgtTheCells[CurrentPos].Element  Key              CurrentPos  2  CollisionNum  1         ifCurrentPos gt HgtTableSize             CurrentPos  HgtTableSize          return CurrentPos  codepre  pAnd here is the headerp  precode    typedef int ElementType     ifndef HashQuadH     define HashQuadH      typedef unsigned int Index     typedef Index Position      struct HashTbl     typedef struct HashTbl HashTable      HashTable InitializeTable int TableSize      void DestroyTable HashTable H      Position Find ElementType Key, HashTable H      void Insert ElementType Key, HashTable H      ElementType Retrieve Position P, HashTable H      HashTable Rehash HashTable H       endif  codepre  pAnd the following are typedefs and structs in source filep  precode    struct HashEntry              ElementType      Element         enum KindOfEntry Info           typedef struct HashEntry Cell       Cell TheCells will be an array of       HashEntry cells, allocated later      struct HashTbl              int TableSize         Cell TheCells      codepre  pThis is the way H being initializedp  precode    HashTable     InitializeTable int TableSize               HashTable H         int i      if TableSize lt MinTableSize                       Error Table size too small              return NULL                    Allocate table          H  malloc sizeof struct HashTbl           if H  NULL              FatalError Out of space           HgtTableSize  NextPrime TableSize            Allocate array of Cells          HgtTheCells  malloc sizeof Cell   HgtTableSize          if HgtTheCells  NULL              FatalError Out of space           for i  0 i lt HgtTableSize i              HgtTheCells[ i ].Info  Empty          return H      codepre  pNow the problem is, however this implementation works fine for most cases. It does encounter crash sometimes. When it happens, I try unittest and find that after calling of strongHashstrong function at one certain round, the value of emCurrentPosem will be assigned to be a integer thats much larger than the actual return value of strongHashstrong function, it could be 1000 plus or even bigger. For example, if emKeyem is 29918 and emTableSizeem is 101, the correct answer and yes the returned value by strongHashstrong is 22, but after the assignment linep  precode CurrentPos  HashKey, HgtTableSize codepre  pThe value of emCurrentPosem changes to be 1580 all by itself, for no reason. Note that the emKeyem value at the time thats randomly assigned using strongrandstrong based on a seed of function strongtimestrong is less than the upperboundary of type integer  I mean there should be no overflow. p  pI tried hard to look closer to the Watches, but there is no other error or clue. Im confused because this error happens really randomly. Is there anyone whos familiar with thisp

Negative 1477 pIm currently having a hard time understanding the linkingloading concept.p  pCould you tell me if following statements on the use of the symbol and relocation tables are correctp  ol liIn a relocatable object file, the symbol table must contain entries for variables and functions which are accessedcalled from other object files. Listing of variables and functions which are not used outside the object file is optional. ul liThis means that if the program consists of only one object file, the symbol table can be omitted.li ulli liIn a relocatable object file, the relocation table holds the adresses of all locations of the assembled code which have to be updated during loading.li liIn a nonrelocatable object file, the relocation table can be ommitted. However, then the object must be loaded into the adress space which is hardcoded into the instructions.li ol  pThanks for your timep

However I cant decide how to design this my service entry point has to be on the C side its a system daemon and one might not want to compile it with the webserver feature.p  pId like to use something like Django to be able to handle the requests routing, security, whatever on the Python side where many, many things already exist. I already have a minimal HTTP server in C mongoose that can process simple requests but Id really like to delegate the actual processing to Python, pretty much the way WSGI does.p  pWhat is a good approach here p

Negative 1477 pI am writing a cucumber framework to test a set of API calls which use long JSON formatted parameters.  I would like to hide the JSON in a template file in order to make the scenario easier for my users to read and DRYer, in that the templates may be used by other scenarios and feature files.  The templates contain placeholders and I would like to rig the cucumberruby code to fill in the values defined in the table of examples.  It appears that ERB is the closest thing to doing the replacement.

Negative 1477 pIve googled this and tried so many different variations. I think the issue Im having is there are so many ways to do this, and Im not seeing the wood for the trees.p  pI have a list of equipment in a database. Each row is assigned to a company. There could be 10 pieces of equipment for company Contoso Ltd, 23 pieces of equipment for Geldof Industries etc.p  pI have a scaffolded view using entity framework to display all the equipment for the entire database. This works fine.p  pWhat I want to do is have a dropdown list on the view, which populates with a list of distinct companies in the table and selecting a company then filters the results in the view.p  pAt the moment my controller has thisp  precode    var serverList  from s in db.tblequipment                      where s.Company  Contoso Ltd ampamp s.CalcContractStatus  true                      where s.Equiptype  PC  s.Equiptype  Laptop  s.Equiptype  Mac  s.Equiptype  Tablet  s.Equiptype.ContainsServer                      select s      return ViewserverList.ToList codepre  pAs I understand it, I would populate a dropdown list based on a LINQ query, and use a viewbag to send that to the view then use a Dropdownlistfor html helper to create the dropdown. Id assume Id then need to capture the post request in someway back in the controller.p  pEvery single site I have found for generating a dropdownlist in Razor and ASP.NET Entity Framework is different. Any help would be much appreciatedp

Negative 1477 pIn a Java ZK application, in ViewModel, I have multiple threads executing a particular function. The first time that function is executed by any thread it takes a long time but after it has been executed once, it returns immediately when executed by the other threads, as it has values retrieved in cache by then. But it should be executed by just one thread the first time, as if multiple threads execute that function, it will not return to any of them as cache remains empty when each of them calls the same functions and as a result, returning time adds up for all of them. So how can I make other threads wait for the first thread to complete as the threads belong to different objects and thus synchronizing the method will not work here. Can a variable be used here which can communicate to the other threads that the first thread has completed Please note that all the threads belong to different objects of the same class i.e a ViewModel and it cannot extend the thread class or implement Runnable as it is a ZK framework class. Any solution can be suggested.p

Negative 1477 pGiven a standard Node.js HTTP library, or an existing REST client library, what would be the most feasible way to allow such a library to perform those HTTP requests over the top of my own protocolp  pTo put this another way I aim provide a module which emlooksem like a HTTP client. It accepts HTTP requests headers, and returns HTTP responses. What options should I consider to adapt an existing REST library to work with my pseudo HTTP client module, as opposed to the standard Node library HTTP client p  pstrongFurther background informationstrong p  pI wish to create a server application based on Node.js which makes HTTP REST requests to a remote embedded device. However, due to NAT, it is not possible for the application server to make client TCP connections directly to the remote device. Therefore, to get around NAT, I will devise my own proprietary protocol which involves the remote device initiating a persistent connection to the application server. Then, once that persistent connection is established, the Node.js application shall be able to make HTTP requests back over that persistent connection to the networked device.p  pMy objective is therefore to create a Node.js module which acts as a bridge layer between incoming socket connections from the networked devices, and the main application which makes REST requests. The aim is that the application would make REST requests as if it were making HTTP client requests to a server, when in fact the HTTP requests and responses are being conveyed on top of the proprietary protocol.p  pAn option Im presently considering is for my bridge module to implement an interface that mimics that of codehttp.requestoptions,[callback]code and somehow enforce a REST client library to use this interface instead of the Node HTTP client. Supposedly at minimum Id have to lightly modify whichever REST client library Id use to achieve this. p  pAs explained above, Im essentially trying to create my own form of NAT traversal using an intermediary server. The intermediary server would provide the frontend UI to users, and make backend data requests to the embedded networked devices. Connections between embedded devices and application server would be persistent, and initiated from the embedded devices, to avoid the usual NAT headaches i.e. the requirement to configure port forwarding.p  pThough I mentioned earlier Id achieve the devicetoserver connection using my own protocol over a raw socket connection, the mechanism Im actually experimenting with right now is to use plain HTTP together with longpolling. The embedded device initiates a HTTP connection to the application server and delayed responses are used to convey data back to the device when the server has something to send. I would then tunnel HTTP requests going in the reverse direction over the top of this.p  pTherefore, in simple terms, my bridge layer is something that accepts HTTP connections inwards from both sides outside device connections, and inside web application REST requests. By using longpolling it would effectively convey requests and responses between the connected clients. p

Negative 1477 pEDITED TWICEp  pMy sqlite cursors are not being notified of changes, even though I set the notification when I create them and notify them when the db is accessed.  I tried something like this to test the methodsp  precodeweatherCursor.getCount  returns 1 deleteAllRecords Uri uri  weatherCursor.getNotificationUri getContext.getContentResolver.notifyChangeuri, null weatherCursor.getCount  still returns 1 weatherCursor.close weatherCursor  getContext.getContentResolver.queryuri, null, null, null, null weatherCursor.getCount finally returns 0 codepre  pWhen I tried to dig into the source for codeContentResolver.notifyChangecode, I found that it tries to use a class called codeIContentObservercode, but the import cannot be resolved.  It does this in a try block, and the catch block is empty, so it silently fails.p  pSimilarly, codeAbstractCursor.setNotificationUricode calls codeContentResolver.registerContentObservercode, which tries to use a class called codeIContentServicecode, also within a try block with an empty catch.  Unlike above, I didnt even see an import statement for codeIContentServicecode.p  pA commenter Lawrence Choy explained that codeIContentObservercode is actually an autogenerated file which is defined in codeIContentObserver.aidlcode.  I serached my entire system for IContentObserver.aidl, and the only hit was the file Android Studio uses to store recent searches, so I dont have this file on my computer.  Im not sure where the file is supposed to be, but I tried deleting and reinstalling the build tools and the API through the SDK manager, and I still dont have it anywhere.p  p[ANOTHER EDIT] The above snippet run in the evaluator was intended to boil all the following code down to the relevent parts, but here is a more complete set of code.

Negative 1477 pWhenever someone working on our project downloads our repository from scratch SVN Checkout there are inevitably problems with Checksum mismatch for a few files. p  pFor example, I went through this today, out of 100,000 files in the repository, 13 of them had the Checksum mismatch error.p  pThis file did not exist on the PC, it was simply checking out the file. I could delete it from the repo, readd it, and then try and check out again on the new PC and it would fail.p  pModifying the file seems to resolve the issue, for example, one of the files is a picture. I modified a single pixel in it, readded it to the repo and then was able to SVNUpdate on the new PC.p  pThere are several files I cant do this with, so I am left stuck not knowing how to proceed.p  pEven trying to rollback the revision on the PC where I deleted it also results in the error.p  pI dont have files to check in, I dont have the files on my PC, I just want them from the repo. Ive tried deleting the whole directory and getting latest again with no success.p  pAt this point I just want to rollback the repo to a particular revision but I cant because when I try I get the checksum mismatch error.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 1477 pI am trying to establish a connection to an external CRM database MySQL in my rails4 app. I am able to connect to the DB through console, and i can use the MySQL2 gem to directly connect and query using this approachp  precodeconnection  Mysql2Client.newhost11.12.14.14,username... results  connection.querySELECT  FROM..... codepre  pHowever, I am confused as to how best to implement and reuse this connection.

So I am not sure if using an abstract model is the best approach here... p  pMy goal is to establish the connection, and then be able to run methods the connection... for example strongExternalCrm.getUserIdfirstname,lastnamestrongp  pWhat would be the best way to accomplish thisp

Negative 1477 p2 weeks ago I had tested a Wordpress forum on my computer using a static IP address 2.231.211.12wordpress and it worked perfectly.p  pNow I moved and I have got a dynamic IP address the address is constantly updated on a hrefhttpdoghot.altervista.orgip.txt relnofollowhttpdoghot.altervista.orgip.txta, mantaining the same computer. For example, in this moment the forums address is a hrefhttp82.53.112.71wordpress relnofollowhttp82.53.112.71wordpressap  pMy problem is that when I load the forum with my browser some things are uploaded and other things are not. The latters are images, css, etc. and they try to be loaded from my past IP address 2.231.211.12, as you can see in the source code once the loading has done, like if somewhere there was an absolute path that force them to load from there.p  pI say once the loading has done because, since some things try to be uploaded from 2.231.211.12, the whole loading has to wait the connection to 2.231.211.12 to be refused. It takes 23 minutes.p  pI cant understand where Wordpress reads that IP that is not mine anymore, and Im not able to analyze the source code to find the problem.p  pMay you help mep

Negative 1477 pIm working on a web project at the moment, and during testing with my cell phone to make sure everything executes correctly, I noticed something peculiar. The IP address of my device was different every time I accessed a new web page. For example, it would appear like this in my logsp  p022715 90000    x.x.x.137p  p022715 90010    x.x.x.38p  petc.p  pThe mobile device is an Android phone connected via a Verizon 4G network.p  pNow, to my knowledge, a mobile device is given temporary ownership of a specific IP address for a given timespan, and this ownership is refreshed periodically if the device continues to access new content. But then it occurred to me that my device might be getting bounced between a couple of different towers and it was being given a new IP address over and over again.p  pI was hoping someone here might be able to provide some clarity on why a devices IP address would change so often, or could point me toward a resource I could read to inform myself.p

Negative 1477 pI have run into a problem, and I am not sure how to resolve this, or if it can be. In my HTMLPHP page, a have a search form. When the user searches for something, instead of passing control to another page, Im using jquery to load another php page into a div container to perform the query and display results. The problem Ive run into is in terms of sorting the results. The way I generally handle sorting, is just to build the URL string containing the new sort parameters, and executeload that URL, which is the same page, just different sort parameters. But with the page that does the query being embedded into another page, I need to reload that page in the containing pages div. But since Im inside the embedded page, I have no access to that pages elements. p  precodelt  Container Page  gt ltdiv classrow searchformcontainer idsearchscriptscontainergt   ltdiv classcolxs3gt     ltdiv classinputgroup inputappend date dataprovidedatepickergt       ltspan classinputgroupaddon addongtFROMltspangt       ltinput typetext classformcontrol idscriptfromdategt       ltspan classinputgroupaddon addongtltspan classglyphicon glyphiconcalendargtltspangtltspangt           ltdivgt   ltdivgt   ltdiv classcolxs3gt     ltdiv classinputgroup inputappend date dataprovidedatepickergt       ltspan classinputgroupaddon addongtTOltspangt       ltinput typetext classformcontrol idscripttodategt       ltspan classinputgroupaddon addongtltspan classglyphicon glyphiconcalendargtltspangtltspangt    ltdivgt   ltdivgt   lt search all input box gt   ltdiv classcolxs4gt     ltdiv classinputgroup inputappendgt       ltspan classinputgroupaddon addongtSEARCHltspangt       ltinput typetext classformcontrol idscriptsearchall gt     ltdivgt   ltdivgt   ltdiv classcolxs1gt     ltbutton typebutton classbtn btnprimary idsbmtscriptssearchgtQueryltbuttongt   ltdivgt ltdivgt     JQuery Function   sbmtscriptssearch.clickfunction       var fromdate  scriptfromdate.val      var todate  scripttodate.val      var searchstr  scriptsearchall.val.replace g,   convert spaces to underscores to pass in url      resultscontainer.loadsearchresults.phpfromdatefromdateamptodatetodateampsearchstrsearchstrampcol0amporderDESC       PHP Results Page    Create and execute query....     selection list to select field to sort by   ltdiv classrow stylemargin40px 0 5px 0gt     ltdiv classcolsm2gtltdivgt     ltdiv classcolsm8gt         ltdiv classcolsm9 alignrightgt             ltlabel forcolsortgtSort Byltlabelgt         ltdivgt         ltdiv classcolsm3 stylepadding0gt             ltselect classsortselect idcolsort stylewidth100 padding0 margin0gt                 ltoption valuesearchprescriptionresults.phpfromdateltfromdategtamptodatelttodategtampsearchstrltsearchstringgtampcol0amporderltsortargs[0][order]gtgt                     Data                 ltoptiongt                 ltoption ltcol  1  selectedselected  gt valuesearchresults.phpfromdateltfromdategtamptodatelttodategtampsearchstrltsearchstringgtampcol1amporderltsortargs[1][order]gtgt                     Data                 ltoptiongt                 ltoption ltcol  2  selectedselected  gt valuesearchresults.phpfromdateltfromdategtamptodatelttodategtampsearchstrltsearchstringgtampcol2amporderltsortargs[2][order]gtgt                     Data                 ltoptiongt                 ltoption ltcol  3  selectedselected  gt valuesearchresults.phpfromdateltfromdategtamptodatelttodategtampsearchstrltsearchstringgtampcol3amporderltsortargs[3][order]gtgt                     Data                 ltoptiongt                 ltoption ltcol  4  selectedselected  gt valuesearchresults.phpfromdateltfromdategtamptodatelttodategtampsearchstrltsearchstringgtampcol4amporderltsortargs[4][order]gtgt                     Data                 ltoptiongt                 ltoption ltcol  5  selectedselected  gt valuesearchresults.phpfromdateltfromdategtamptodatelttodategtampsearchstrltsearchstringgtampcol5amporderltsortargs[5][order]gtgt                     Data                 ltoptiongt                 ltoption ltcol  6  selectedselected  gt valuesearchresults.phpfromdateltfromdategtamptodatelttodategtampsearchstrltsearchstringgtampcol6amporderltsortargs[6][order]gtgt                     Data                 ltoptiongt             ltselectgt         ltdivgt     ltdivgt     ltdiv classcolsm2gtltdivgt ltdivgt     display query results   ltdiv classrow stylemargintop10pxgt     ltdiv classcolsm2gtltdivgt     ltdiv classcolsm8gt       ltdiv classpanel paneldefaultgt         ltdiv classpanelheadinggt           lta hrefview.phprxltbase64encodedata[number]gtgtdataltdatagtltagt         ltdivgt         ltdiv classpanelbodygt           ltdiv classcolsm6gt             ltpgt               ltstronggtDataltstronggt ltresult1gtltbrgt               ltstronggtDataltstronggt ltresult2gtltbrgt               ltstronggtDataltstronggt ltresult3gtltbrgt             ltpgt           ltdivgt           ltdiv classcolsm6gt             ltpgt               ltstronggtDataltstronggt ltresult4gtltbrgt                        ltstronggtDataltstronggt ltresult5gtltbrgt               ltstronggtDataltstronggt ltresult6gt             ltpgt           ltdivgt         ltdivgt       ltdivgt     ltdivgt     ltdiv classcolsm2gtltdivgt   ltdivgt codepre  pHere is the basics of whats going on..

Negative 1477 pAs an exercise, I decided to write a SimCity original clone in Swift for OSX. I started the project using SpriteKit, originally having each tile as an instance of codeSKSpriteNodecode and swapping the texture of each node when that tile changed. This caused terrible performance, so I switched the drawing over to regular Cocoa windows, implementing codedrawRectcode to draw codeNSImagecodes at the correct tile position. This solution worked well until I needed to implement animated tiles which refresh very quickly.p  pFrom here, I went back to the first approach, this time using a texture atlas to reduce the amount of draws needed, however, swapping textures of nodes that need to be animated was still very slow and had a huge detrimental effect on frame rate.p  pIm attempting to display a 44x44 tile map where each tile is 16x16 pixels. I know here must be an efficient or perhaps more correct way to do this. This leads to my questionp  pIs there an efficient way to support 1500 nodes in SpriteKit and which are animated through changing their textures More importantly, am I taking the wrong approach by using SpriteKit and codeSKSpriteNodecode for each tile in the map even if I only redraw the dirty ones Would another approach perhaps, OpenGL be betterp  pAny help would be greatly appreciated. Id be happy to provide code samples, but Im not sure how relevanthelpful they would be for this question.p  pstrongEditstrong Here are some links to relevant drawing code and images to demonstrate the issuep  pScreenshot img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comiu5IO.png altSwiftopolisp  pWhen the player clicks on the small map, the center position of the large map changes.

Negative 1477 pMy textbook for theory of computation has an example for explaining polynomial time algorithmsp  pPATH  [G,s,t]G is a directed graph that has a directed path from s to t.p  pA polynomial time algorithm M for PATH operates as follows. M  On input [G,s,t], where G is a directed graph with nodes s and tp  ol liPlace a mark on node s. li liRepeat the following until no additional nodes are marked li liScan all the edges of G. If an edge a,b is found going from a marked node a to an unmarked node b, mark node b. li liIf t is marked, accept. Otherwise, reject.li ol  pThen they go on to explain how the algorithm runs in polynomial time p  pObviously, stages 1 and 4 are executed only once. Stage 3 runs at most m times because each time except the last it marks an additional node in G. Thus, the total number of stages used is at most 1 1m, giving a polynomial in the size of G. p  pm is the number of nodes in the graphp  pMy question is that wouldnt Stage 3 run at most emm1em times instead of m times, since the first node is marked in stage 1p  pThanksp

Here is what I am doing right nowp  pStep 1, User login at SSO site, log user in by validate user credentials against database and if valid, retrieve other information like roles, email, phone no, etc. from database. p  pStep 2, Use jwt token to store the user id and pass to the sub systemp  pStep 3, The subsystem grabs the user id from the token, log the user in without checking the credentials, but still retrieve other information like roles, email, phone no, etc.p  pThis works fine, but I find that in the third step, the sub system still has to retrieve user information from database to be wasteful.

But thats not a problem for all the responses that u can give me because i can read english pretty well yeah, im a lazzy a.s.s. to learn it as should have to.p  pSecond, im learning android right now and had been developing an app for like a month. The problem is that my app have an actionbar Menu on the Activity that contains 3 fragments THAT ARE ADDED BY a VIEWPAGER, so i cant cast them in activity to run their methods.... Thats a big problem. Each one of those fragments have several EditText, and what i want is to USE MY ACTIVITY ACTIONBAR MENU ITEM CLICK to store all data from the EdtiTexts and store it in an SQLite Database one table per fragment.p  pI have been done everything and the only thing that i need isis to know how to call methods from the three fragments when pressing an item, on the onOptionClickListener OF THE MENU ITEM OF MY ACTIVITY.  The most important thing is that is the menu of my activity, not the fragments, and i cant instantate the fragments on my activity because im using viewpager to create them.p  pSorry again of my mispells, and sorry for not posting my code, but, is really large so instead of make it clear my problem im gonna confuse everbody, so its better that you can help me withow the need of my really large code, so thanks for understanding and helping me.p

For example, a member computer that uses a primary DNS suffix   of corp.fabrikam.com in an Active Directory domain named   na.corp.fabrikam.com is using a disjoint namespace. A disjoint   namespace is more complex to administer, maintain, and troubleshoot   than a contiguous namespace. In a contiguous namespace, the primary   DNS suffix matches the Active Directory domain name. Network   applications that are written to assume that the Active Directory   namespace is identical to the primary DNS suffix for all domain member   computers do not function properly in a disjoint namespace.p blockquote  pThe question is how I know if this is suported by my application I have no way to test it at this point.p

Negative 1477 pI have an interesting problem that I need to solve on some production code. We are currently developing a web service that will be called from many different applications and will essentially be used to send emails. Whenever a new email is sent we will eventually need to add a receipt for that email into the database, but ideally we dont want to do this immediately so we will be building up a buffer over time. Once the buffer reaches a certain length, or after a sufficient time has passed the contents of the buffer will be flushed into the database.p  pThink of it like this, when a thread sends an email it will lock the buffer in order to add its log without interference and maintain thread safety. If it sees that the buffer is of a certain size in this example we will say 1000 than it is the threads responsibility to write it all to the database I think this is inefficient, but Im using Service Stack as our web framework so if theres a way to delegate this task I would rather go with that approach.p  pNow, since writing to the database may be time consuming we want to add a secondary buffer to be used. So once one buffer is full all new requests will log their work into the second buffer while the first one is being flushed. Similarly once the second buffer is full all the threads will move back to the first buffer will the second is being flushed.p  pThe primary issues we need to solvep  ul liWhen a thread decides it needs to flush one of the buffers it needs to indicate to all new threads to start logging to the second buffer This should be as trivial as changing some variable or pointer to point to the empty bufferli liIf there are currently threads blocked when the current user of the critical section decides to flush the log it needs to reactivate all the blocked threads and point them to the second bufferli ul  pIm more concerned with the second bulletpoint.

Negative 1477 pIm wondering what the best practice for instantiating a Realm database is for Swift 2. One of the major differences between Realm for Swift 1.2 and Swift 2 is that the Realm class has added support for error handling. Therefore, this code on the Realm website does not work anymorep  plet realm  Realmp  pI can think of a couple ways to instantiate a Realm class in the Swift 2 worldp  p1 let realm  try Realmp  pThis option seems a little unsafe to me as it potentially results in a runtime error if the class fails to instantiate.p  p2 Place entire Realm operation including class instantiation inside DoCatch blockp  precodedo      let realm  try Realm      realm.writerealm.addmyObject          catch              printSome Realm error      codepre  pThis definitely works and is definitely safe.  HOWEVER, I dont really like having to instantiate the Realm class every time I need to perform an operation on the database.  If I try to create an IVAR realm and place it outside of the DoCatch block, the variable goes out of scope. For instance, the following code will not compile...p  precode    IVAR declared outside of DoCatch...     let realmRealm      do         Get instance of Realm         realm  try Realm          This write operation works         realm.writerealm.addmyObject1          catch              printSome Realm error            Create another Dog object     let myObject2  SomeObject      This next line produces an error  Variable realm used before being initialized.     Initialized realm inside DoCatch is now out of scope.     realm.write         realm.addmyObject2      codepre  pId appreciate any feedback especially someone from Realm on what the best practice for working with Realms in the new error handling environment of Swift 2 should look like.  Thanks in advance.p

Negative 1477 pIn my project I have default WPF codeDataGridcode with codeItemsSourcecode bound to codeObservableCollectioncode of businessobjects from ViewModel. This collection is pretty frequently updated items might be added, removed and updated, all objects do implement codeINotifyPropertyChangedcode and everything works fine.p  pUsers are allowed to change sorting in codeDataGridcode by clicking column headers. This part works too ALMOST always.p  pThe propblem occures when two events happen at the same time Collection modification and dataGrid sorting and exception is thrown, stating that Sorting cant be performed while NewItem or EditItem is in progress Not exact message, original message is not in english and I could not find english version. p  pAlso we could not reproduce the problem in debuggable environment, but we have crashreports of it. p  pI understand what is the root of the problem and whats kind of wrong. But I still cant figure out what should I can I do to fix it. I can not manually commit codeCollectionViewcode changes andor delay sorting, since its somewhere inside codeDataGridcode. I can not control user sort Enabling since it would cause inconvinience for users. I can not even trycatch this exception because the action that throws comes from windows message pumping user action and goes straight to framework code. p  pShould I maybe create codeCollectionViewcode inside ViewModel, control it and bind datagrid to it, but wont datagrid still have same problem with its internal view Maybe there are some common practices or bugs, that I could not find about.p  pI can provide some code if needed, but everything seems common and straightforward.p

Instead, there were two new options Empty Activity and Blank Activity. a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comxZGkj.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comxZGkj.png altenter image description herea  I opted Blank Activity and had following files inserted. p  ol liMainActivity.java Activity class a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comSQj0V.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comSQj0V.png altmainActivity.java fileali liactivitymain.xml layout of activity a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comDsl8o.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comDsl8o.png altactivitymain.xml fileali licontentmain.xml content of activity included by activtiymain.xml a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comCn2cO.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comCn2cO.png altcontentmain.xml fileali ol  pSo my question is, what is the new pattern for development that Android developer should followp  pEDIT strongHow to use the previous pattern of ActivityFragmentstrong To get Fragment back into picture you need to select use a fragment in dialog that appears after selecting Blank Activity a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.com3hJSR.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com3hJSR.png altenter image description hereap

Negative 1477 pI got hit earlier this week with my first BadImageFormatException when trying to use the p4api.net.dll.

I am still new to both p4api.net emandem having to deal with this sort of dependency, but my understanding is that if I can build p4api.net.dll as Any CPU the warning would go away, and I would just need to do some magic to make sure the correct p4bridge.dll was used depending on the CurrentPlatform I defined in the project.p  pI downloaded and compiled the p4api.net source and tried specifying any CPU, but it didnt work. Now it says that the architecture is set for x86 and I still get a similar MSB3270 error  now for x86.  I dont get a warning like this with the p4api.net solution, however, so it doesnt emappearem to have any platform dependencies that I am aware of.
