Positive 3143 pTo exercise my OOP abilities on Scalaspecific features, I have tried to design a game where I have a codePlayercode class. It has an abstract method codeplaycode which decides, given a list of players different from the player the method is called on, what action to take. I wanted to prevent the codeplaycode method to alter the state of this other players. The right way to play is to cast a codeSpellcode and let the system reflect its effect on other players. p  pYet, the codeplaycode method needs read access to the other players to decide a strategy. I have thus created an inner singleton codeReadOnlyPlayercode. I made it a singleton to prevent copying over and over and simply returning this singleton everytime.p  precodeabstract class Playerprivate var health Int  0      Check.isPositivehealth      def health  health      def playplayers List[]  how to denote inner type ReadOnlyPlayer       def hitdamage Int   health  max0, health  damage this       def safeCopy  ReadOnlyPlayer      final object ReadOnlyPlayer extends Player          override def health  health           noop         override def hit damage Int    this         override def playplayers List[]         codepre  pI cant get it to compile because of the line I put a comment on. I am aware of a number of workarounds to this issue p  ul lipif it was a class instead of a singleton, I could use codePlayerReadOnlyPlayercode. I tried, it works fine. However, this requires to create a new copy everytime, so if I wanted to do this it would actually be better to create a separate immutable class. pli lipI could manually implement a singleton pattern and always return the same instance of this class. pli lipI could make the class private and only declare codePlayercode, but I want my clients to know they explicitly know they wont be able to modify the codePlayercode instance. I can do this using an sealed empty trait with a meaningful name.pli ul  pI know how I can handle this in various ways, so my question is more out of curiosity  stronghow can one denote an inner singleton type strongp

So somehow we need the program to download the files, when a certain functions in code are asked to run. p  p2 Publishing to datastore The system uses a bunch of model files to make predictions.

Positive 3143 pI like implicit definitions. They make the code look nice, they make the user feel  some features are naturally available on a class when its just an implicit definition. Yet, I was thinking about JS prototypes, where you can basically define a method on a class you did not write. But if in the next version this class defines a method with the same signature and makes assumptions on its behaviour, youre screwed.p  pScalas implicits enable to do almost the same thing with one major difference  the implicit definitions are scoped, therefore there is no risk for the author of a class to have code injected by an implicit definition in someone elses code. But what about the users code  Is it protected from a change in the class hes adding implicits to p  pLets consider this code p  precodeclass HeyMan      def hello  printlnHello   object Main extends App      val heyMan  new HeyMan      implicit class ImplicitHeyManheyMan HeyMan          def hello  printlnWhats up           heyMan.hello  prints Hello  codepre  pPretty bad, isnt it  To me, the correct behaviour should be that the implicit definition always shades the real definition, so that the user code is protected from the apparition of new methods in the API hes calling into.p  pWhat do you think  Is there a way to make it safe or should we stop using implicits this way p

Positive 3143 pAs I understand the semantics of a custom constructor may be typically added to a class via a companion object. Is there then, any way to inherit a custom constructor while inheriting a class p  pOn the one hand I have found that companion objects are not synthetically inherited along a case class, and on the other, I am not aware of a way of creating custom constructors inside a class itself, so that they are inherited. And yet inheriting custom constructors seems to be a perfectly valid use case to me.

Positive 3143 pGiven an input of a perfect cube of a number which denotes number of nodes of a network, I want to be able to return the neighbors of all nodes as they would be connected in a 3d grid. For example if I am given 27 nodes I want to write a program to return all neighbors of all nodes. 0 will have neighbors 1,9,4 as it is a corner node. But an internal node will have one edge extra so 2 will have 0,3,11,5. Any mathematical way of formulating this It is quite clear that number of node Or  square of cuberoot of total number of nodes will give me a neighbour. For example 0 has 9, 1 has 10 and so on. Any way of finding out which nodes are corner and which are middle nodes So that we can find out if a node has 3 neighbours or 4.p

Doing codemono postcommit.exe REPOS REVcode works fine. The main problem is that to execute, I need to have something of the name codepostcommitcode so that it will be called. But it does not work from a shell script, and as noted above, the codemkbundlecode is not working with a different problem.p
Negative 3143 pI understand, in a fuzzy sort of way, how regular ACID transactions work.  You perform some work on a database in such a way that the work is not confirmed until some kind of commit flag is set.  The commit part is based on some underlying assumption like a single disk block write is atomic.  In the event of a catastrophic error, you can just clear out the uncommitted data in the recovery phase.p  pHow do distributed transactions work  In some of the MS documentation I have read that you can somehow perform a transaction across databases and filesystems among other things.p  pThis technology could be and probably is used for installers, where you want the program to be fully installed or fully absent.  You simply begin a transaction at the start of the installer.  Next you could connect to the registry and filesystem, making the changes that define the installation.  When the job is done, simply commit, or rollback if the installation fails for some reason.  The registry and filesystem are automatically cleaned for you by this magical distributed transaction coordinator.p  pHow is it possible that two disparate systems can be transacted upon in this fashion  It seems to me that it is always possible to leave the system in an inconsistent state, where the filesystem has committed its changes and the registry has not.  I think in MSDTC it is even possible to perform a transaction across the network.p  pI have read a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.comflorinlazararchive2004030484199.aspxhttpblogs.msdn.comflorinlazararchive2004030484199.aspxa, but it feels like only the beginning of the explanation, and that step 4 should be expanded considerably.p  pstrongEditstrong From what I gather on a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiDistributedtransactionhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiDistributedtransactiona, it can be accomplished by a twophase commit a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiTwophasecommithttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiTwophasecommita.  After reading this, Im still not understanding the method 100, it seems like there is a lot of room for error between the steps.p
Negative 3143 pThe situation we have a large database with a number of denormalized tables. We frequently have to resummarize the data to keep the summary tables in synch. Weve talked on and off about using computed columns to keep the data fresh. Weve also talked about triggers, but thats a separate discussion.p  pIn our summary tables, we denormalized the table such that the Standard ID as well as the Standard Description is stored in the table.  This inherently assumes that the table will be resummarized often enough so that if they change the standard description, it will also change it in the summary table. A bad assumption.p  pQuestion What if we made the Standard Description in the summary table a derivedcomputed column which selects the standard description from the standard table Is there a tremendous performance hit by dropping a computed column on a table with 100,000500,000 rowsp

Negative 3143 pI have around 4000 entities that I need to insert into a Java App Engine datastore.  As I understand it, only the Python version of App Engine currently has tools to upload data from a CSV file to a datastore.  So, what I have done thus far is follow the instructions at a hrefhttpcode.google.comappenginedocspythontoolsuploadingdata.html relnofollowhttpcode.google.comappenginedocspythontoolsuploadingdata.htmla and have successfully written my 4000 or so entities into my local datastore using Python.  I am only using Python for the sake of taking the entities from a .csv and writing them to the datastore.  I have verified that the entities are there by using the ahadmin address on my local host python version of app engine to see the data viewer.  p  pWhat I want to do now is to use those entities locally in my initial Java version.  Now, this is normally not a problem when the entities are uploaded using Python to the deployed version of App Engine, because different versions of the same project share the same datastore, regardless of runtime.  So, If I had been writing all the .csv rows to the deployed Python version of my app, my deployed Java version would be able to see all the entities uploaded through my Python version.  BUT, how do you achieve the same thing locallyp  pAs I understand it, the Java version of App Engine creates a local datastore in a .bin file in the WEBINF directory.  Does the Python version of App Engine create a similar .bin file somewhere that I could just copy over into my Java version  I havent even been able to track down where exactly the Python version is storing its data locally yet.  Any help is much appreciated.p

Negative 3143 pMy company has haphazardly upgraded the production server of our website to CF9, and while we were relatively lucky with very few incompatibilities, I am running into one problem that over the last week has caused me a considerable amount of grief.p  pOur sites use the Coldbox framework with the Transfer ORM, with function inheritance through abstract objects.  Previously in CF8, when I would cfdump an object, I could view all of my setters and getters that existed in the object.  However, CF9 modified the cfdump function to dump only the metadata for the object.  The new CF9 documentation states that there is a metainfo tag that when set as true, strongshouldstrong dump inherited objects like my setters and getters for my database columns, but in this instance, it does not work.p  pWhile ultimately this isnt a backbreaking problem, its become a considerable pain for me as I dont have rote memorization of all the functions in these objects Ill be looking to dump a function because I know what Im looking for but dont quite remember the name, only to find that its not being dumped because of the way its inherited from Transfer.  Ive tried the following things so far as solutions without any luckp  pcfdump metainfotrue Creating dump function in the abstract decorator creating a dump function in the base decorator Creating dump functions in defined override decoratorsp  pWere using the latest versions of Coldspring and Transfer, and Coldbox 2.6.4.

Negative 3143 pIm writing some code that has to cascade delete records in a certain database, and I noticed a drop in performance as the database has more records in it. When I just fill the database it doesnt seem like there is a big drop in performance between the start of the filling and right at the end, yet when I do a cascade delete performance goes down with a bigger database. Im assuming that it would need to make a lot of joins for the cascade to find all the related records in other tables, which causes it to slow down on bigger datasets. But when I just add a record, wouldnt it also have to test for already existing primary keys and other unique constraints and wouldnt this also have to be slower in bigger datasets, or is this so incredibly fast compared to the delete process that its hard to notice a performace drop when youre just filling a database Or are the cascades just slow because I didnt specifically index the tables that it cascades top  pSo secondly, would indexing the tables it cascades to speed up the cascading if those tables already have a generated id as primary key In a more general sense are primary keys automatically indexedp

Negative 3143 pSpecifically, how to implement the multiplayer portion  Ive been toying around with checkers to exercise my JSPHPAJAX muscles and have it working pretty well for one person or two people on the same computer.

I have the AJAX portion down, and the server is receivingsending moves fromto the browser.  I just cant wrap my head around what I need to do next to incorporate a second player.p  pDo I need MySQL for something as simple as this  Can I use some combination of the players session IDs to just transmit the moves back and forth, rather than storing any info serverside  How does a game session even get started between these two independent entitiesp  pSorry if this question is ignorant, but Im just really unsure on how to proceed from this point.p  pstrongEditstrong Just to clarify, theres definitely a server involved hence the PHPAJAX references.

Negative 3143 pI have a few questions that are related to this same topic, so I thought it would be nice to ask them in a single thread.  I have perused over some other related topic but havent been able to find quite the answer Im looking for.  In general, most of these seem to be related to security issues. br  My questions are as followsp  ol liI want to access a file, preferable with an XMLHttpRequest object as it is an xml file I wanted to use.  I am using chrome and when I attempt to access the file, I get this as a result in my javascript console br  XMLHttpRequest cannot load filehomelazarusDesktopsitesparserdata.xml.  br  Cross origin requests are only supported for HTTP. xmlreqtest.html11Uncaught Error NETWORKERR XMLHttpRequest Exception 101  br  Ive looked over a few other answers that are related to this exception and most of them specify something to do with either changing the domain, making a proxy, or changing security settings, but none of them have worked as of yet.  I wanted to make web sites that can be stored on a persons computer without having to be hosted and be able to access files for data storage, so hosting them in this case is not an option.  Preferably Id like to find a way to bypass the security settings. lili Similarly to the last issue, I wanted to find a way that once I make changes to a web page, I could store data about the page on the clients computer.  Serverside scripts give this option, but I havent been able to find anything for javascript to do it.  In either of these issues, jquery would be sufficient as well, if it would solve the problem. liol  pIn general I would like to try to find ways to make web pages operate as standalone applications on a persons computer, integrating everything from GUIs to graphics and all that fun stuff.  I would eventually like to integrate things like SMIL and SVG into web pages and something like XUL that will work on any browser, not just mozillabased ones.  That stuff can wait for later, this stuff will have to be taken care of first because its the most essential to the whole process.p

Negative 3143 pIve got a server side protocol that controls a telephony system, Ive already implemented a client library that communicates with it which is in production now, however there are some problems with the system I have at the moment, so I am considering rewriting it.p  pMy client library is currently written in Java but I am thinking of rewriting it in both C and Java to allow for different clients to have access to the same back end.p  pThe messages start with a keyword have a number of bytes of meta data and then some data. The messages are always terminated by an end of message character.p  pCommunication is duplex between the client and the server usually taking the form of a request from the Client which provokes several responses from the server, but can be notifications.  The messages are marked as being on ofp  pC Commandp  pP Pending server is still handling the requestp  pD Data data as a response to  p  pR Responsep  pB Busy Server is too busy to handle response at the momentp  pN Notificationp  pMy current architecture has each message being parsed and a thread spawned to handle it, however Im finding that some of the Notifications are processed out of order which is causing me some trouble as they have to be handled in the same order they arrive.p  pThe duplex messages tend to take the following message format Client  Server Command Server  Client Pending Optional Server  Client Data optional Server  Client Response 2nd entry in message data denotes whether this is an error or notp  pIve been using the protocol for over a year and Ive never seen the a busy message but that doesnt mean they dont happen.p  pThe server can also send notifications to the client, and there are a few Response messages that are auto triggered by events on the server so they are sent without a corresponding Command being issued.p  pSome Notification Messages will arrive as part of sequence of messages, which are related for examplep  pNotificationName  M00001  NotificationName  M00001  NotificationName  M00000p  pThe string M0000X means that either there is more data to come or that this is the end of the messages.p  pAt present the tcp client is fairly dumb it just spawns a thread that notifies an event on a subscriber that the message has been received, the event is specific to the message keyword and the type of message So data,Responses and Notifications are handled separately this works fairly effectively for Data and response messages, but falls over with the notification messages as they seem to arrive in rapid sequence and a race condition sometimes seems to cause the Message end to be processed before the ones that have the data are processed, leading to lost message data.p  pGiven this really badly written description of how the system works how would you go about writing the client side transport codep  pThe meta data does not have a message number, and I have not control over the underlying protocol as its provided by a vendor.p

Negative 3143 pI have a Java class that is stored in an HttpSession object thats serialized and transfered between servers in a cluster environment. For the purpose of this explanation, lets call this class Person.p  pWhile in the process of improving the code, this class was moved from com.acme.Person to com.acme.entity.Person. Internally, the class remains exactly the same same fields, same methods, same everything.p  pThe problem is that we have two sets of servers running the old code and the new code at the same time. The servers with the old code have serialized HttpSession object and when the new code unserializes it, it throws a ClassNotFoundException because it cant find the old reference to com.acme.Person. At this point, its easy to deal with this because we can just recreate the object using the new package. The problem then becomes that the HttpSession in the new servers, will serialize the object with the new reference to com.acme.entity.Person, and when this is unserialized in the servers running the old code, another exception will be thrown. At this point, we cant deal with this exception anymore.p  pWhats the best strategy to follow for this kind of cases Is there a way to tell the new servers to serialize the object with the reference to the old package and unserialize references to the old package to the new one  How would we transition to using the new package and forgetting about the old one once all servers run the new code p

Negative 3143 pI ran into a rather annoying issue with the list of open devices, trying to construct a function that saves a number of graphs for a list. Say we have following data p  precodeAlist lt list   X1  data.frameXrnorm10,Y110,   X2  data.frameXrnorm10,Y110,   X3  data.frameXrnorm10,Y110  codepre  pand following function p  precodemyPlotFunc lt functionx,saveF     fnames lt pastenamesx,pdf,sep.     fori in 1lengthx       ifsave         pdffnames[i]         on.exitdev.off,addT              plotx[[i]]          fnames    codepre  pIf I run codefnames lt myPlotFuncAlist,saveTcode, everything behaves normally and I get 3 pdf files names codeX1.pdfcode to codeX3.pdfcode. That is, if theres no graphics window open. If there is, then one of the pdfs is not closed, and all subsequent plots are added to the pdf until I explicitly call codedev.offcode in the console. Like this p  precodeplotAlist[[1]] fnames lt myPlotFuncAlist,saveT myPlotFuncAlist,saveF  gt dev.list pdf    4  codepre  pIf I add codeon.exitprintdev.curdev.off,addTcode , I get following output p  precodegt fnames lt myPlotFuncAlist,saveT pdf    5  windows        2  pdf    3  codepre  pSo apparently it takes the list from the bottom up again to close everything it meets. So if there is a graphics window open, that is the next current device. Meaning that the secondlast opened pdfconnection will not be closed by dev.off any more, as there will be one short in the codeon.exitcode call.p  pI got around it by changing my function to p  precodemyPlotFunc lt functionx,saveF     fnames lt pastenamesx,pdf,sep.     devs lt NULL     on.exitfori in devs dev.offi, addT     fori in 1lengthx       ifsave         pdffnames[i]         devs lt cdevs,dev.cur              plotx[[i]]          fnames    codepre  pbut this feels rather awkward.

Negative 3143 pI know this is a popular topic, but Ive been searching quite a bit trying to find the answer and strangely havent found anything that has been able to help...p  pIve got a basic Rails 3 application displaying database entries in a table. A separate application posts new entries into the database, and Id like the Rails app to poll and refresh to display the new content. Right now, I have a terrible piece of javascript simply reloading the whole page and its proving to be my roadblock. I have a search bar and check bars to remove multiple items, but these are both reset upon a page refresh again, I know this is awful and horrendously broken. p  pFrom what I have read, I gather that I should use AJAX to poll the database and simply render  database entries that are newer than the newest entry displayed. How to precisely execute this is another story...p  pMost of the tutorials I have found have been out of date, and Ive been unable to get the legacy code running. I am new to both AJAX and Rails, and I would love if anyone has any guidance, advice, tutorials, or personal criticism P that may point me in the right direction.p  pThanksp  pEDIT Ive got new entries being pulled into the page, but they arent rendering correctly at all.

Negative 3143 pIm currently building a website which uses Projekktor to play the movies and JQuery for almost everything else, i.e, navigation, displaying panels etc. The development link is  a hrefhttpwww.hundredframes.comdevhome relnofollowhttpwww.hundredframes.comdevhomeap  pIve got the site to run on Firefox, Chrome, Safari and Opera.

Negative 3143 pI am making an application where I have three main Presenters.p  pIn one say ListPresenter, I have a Tree with a list of cities.

WritePresenter fires an event on the EventBus with details of for which item the event is being fired. ShowPresenter listens to these events and based on the ListPresenter state needs to update itself.p  pNow how should ShowPresenter get access to ListPresenter state. I could just get a refrence of it from the Class which instantiate ListPresenter. But that dosent seem to be a good design idea.

A reference to these web services is added through the Add Web Reference menu in Visual Studio 2008, which, as you know, creates a proxy class for each endpoint which inherits from codeSystem.ServiceModel.ChannelBaseltISomeInterfacegtcode where codeISomeInterfacecode is the endpoint defined by the specific services WSDL.p  pThe question is that I would like to encapsulate all those proxies in a single codeServiceManagercode for instance static class containing, for example, an internal list of all the proxies, so that, on the one hand, all calls to a given service may go through codeServiceManagercode instead of being scattered around the main application, and, on the other hand, new services which may be added latter can be made known to codeServiceManagercode by a simple addition of a reference to the new proxy class.p  pI thought about desinging codeServiceManagercode likep  precodepublic static class ServiceManager      region Properties      public static Dictionaryltstring, TProxygt ServiceList  get private set       endregion  codepre  pbut I dont know what I should replace codeTProxycode by so that all of the different proxies can be called by using codeServiceManager.ServiceList[ServiceName]code. Can anyone please help me out with thisp

Negative 3143 pIm working on a program for my dissertation that hopefully, when finished will enable you to sort music files using the tag data. At the moment I have a wpf tree view that I want to display a list of all the music the program has found sorted by ArtistAlbumTitle. I have a list of tag files collected using taglib that I can use to create TreeViewItems for each track and can then add them to the TreeView. The problem is that I cant seem to avoid adding duplicates of artistsalbums instead of adding the track as a child of the already added artistalbum. I have been trying to use foreach to iterate through the items and if the headerartist name matches the header of the new artist to be added, then move onto the album instead and add that as a child of the current item, then do the same check for albums and move on to the track title and so forth. I have been having little joy though as even if the headers match exactly they always seem to return as nonmatching and thus a dupliacte artist is added. p  pIm totally new to using TreeViews so Im not sure Im going about this in the best way, or if its just a flaw in my logic or whatever so any help would be greatly appreciated. p  pAttatched is the code im using to create and check the items.p  precode    public void PopulateTreeViewTreeView searchResults                foreach TagLib.File tagFile in tagFiles                      TreeViewItem Artist             TreeViewItem Album             TreeViewItem Title             creating the TreeViewItems             Artist  SetArtistsNametagFile             Album  SetAlbumNametagFile             Title  SetTrackNametagFile             adding them to TreeView             AddArtistToTreeViewtagFile, searchResults, Artist, Album, Title                codepre  pThe functions that create the TreeViewItemsp  precode    private TreeViewItem SetArtistsNameTagLib.File tagFile              TreeViewItem Artist  new TreeViewItem         if tagFile.Tag.AlbumArtists.Length  0                      Artist.Header  Unknown Artist             return Artist                  else                      Artist.Header  tagFile.Tag.AlbumArtists[0].ToString             return Artist                    private TreeViewItem SetAlbumNameTagLib.File tagFile              TreeViewItem Album  new TreeViewItem         Album.Header  tagFile.Tag.Album         return Album           private TreeViewItem SetTrackNameTagLib.File tagFile              TreeViewItem Track  new TreeViewItem         Track.Header  tagFile.Tag.Title         return Track      codepre  pAnd the code for adding to the TreeViewChecking for duplicatesp  precode        private void AddArtistToTreeViewTagLib.File tagFile, TreeView searchResults, TreeViewItem Artist, TreeViewItem Album, TreeViewItem Title              if searchResults.Items.Count  0                      searchResults.Items.AddArtist             Artist.Items.AddAlbum             Album.Items.AddTitle                   else                      artistFlag  CheckArtistsearchResults, Artist             switch artistFlag                              case 0                     searchResults.Items.AddArtist                 if Artist.Items.Count  0                                      Artist.Items.AddAlbum                     Album.Items.AddTitle                                  break                  case 1                     albumFlag  CheckAlbumArtist, Album                     switch albumFlag                                              case 0                              Artist.Items.AddAlbum                         if Album.Items.Count  0                                                      Album.Items.AddTitle                                                  break                          case 1                             trackFlag  CheckTitleAlbum, Title                         break                          case 2                         break                                      break                  case 2                 break                                 private int CheckArtistTreeView searchResults, TreeViewItem Artist              if searchResults.Items.Count  0                      return 0                  else                      foreach TreeViewItem tvi in searchResults.Items                              if tvi.Header.ToString  Artist.Header.ToString                                      return 0                                  else                                      return 1                                                         return 2                    private int CheckAlbumTreeViewItem Artist, TreeViewItem Album              if Artist.Items.Count  0                      return 0                  else                      foreach TreeViewItem tvi in Artist.Items                              if tvi.Header.ToString  Album.Header.ToString                                      return 0                                  else                                      return 1                                           return 2                    private int CheckTitleTreeViewItem Album, TreeViewItem Title              if Album.Items.Count  0                      return 0                  else                      foreach TreeViewItem tvi in Album.Items                              if tvi.Header.ToString  Title.Header.ToString                                      return 0                                  else                                      return 1                                           return 2               codepre  pSorry, this is a bit of a lengthy one but again, any help would be greatly appreciated  Thanksp

Negative 3143 pThis is what the documentation If the first responder [to an event or action message] cannot handle an event or action message, it forwards it to the next responder in a linked series called the responder chain. The responder chain allows responder objects to transfer responsibility for handling an event or action message to other objects in the application. If an object in the responder chain cannot handle the event or action, it resends the message to the next responder in the chain. The message travels up the chain, toward higherlevel objects, until it is handled. If it isnt handled, the application discards it.p  pOkay, what is the next responderp  pIs it the parent view The view behind it How do IPhone decides first responder second responderp

Negative 3143 pThere is an old database which needs to be ported to a new one but the porting process will take significant time during which the old db will remain operational.  In the old DB the IDs are sequential numbers in the new one we need globally unique identifiers which in case of hibernate we are or were going to generate using the hibernates built in UUID generation. I have no idea about how ithibernates UUID works and dont know if this is the same as the javas native UUID generation. Actually hibernate provides 2 uuid generation strategies uuid and uuid2.p  pThe problem is that if we use hibernates generation its possible that there will be a collision between the hibernate generated IDs and the IDs coming from the old DB while its still working. We are going to write a number of oracle procedures to help us smartly transfer the IDs from the old database to the new one but what ID generation technique we should use in those procedures so we dont have ID collisions with the IDs generated by hibernatep  pWe can use oracles built in GUID generator or write a procedure in java and use javas native UUID generator.

Negative 3143 pstrongWhat Im Doingstrongp  pIm pretty new to Core Data, and Ive realized that my current use of it in my app is far from good. Basically, Ive got an entity with about four different string properties. Every time I work with the database, I just pass around arrays with each of the four strings. p  pNow, what I want to do is add more properties to this entity. It would also be great if I could add methods to this entity to save a lot of repetition whenever I use the database in different classes.p  pSo, Ive figured that the best way and probably how I should have done it originally is to use Xcode to create a class for this entity  theres plenty of tutorials online for this. That way, I could just pass instances of this class around  much cleaner than using arraysp  hr  pstrongWhere Im stuckstrongp  pIs there an easy way to migrate from my current core data model to one with added properties and a corresponding class I also want to split one of the existing strings into two as the migration happens name into first  last name.p  pShould I be using the built in migration tools Or, should I just create a new database model completely from scratch, and build a custom class that checks for the old database, converts each object and stores it in the newer What would be the best way to go about this  as Im new to databasescore data, I dont want to start just to find out theres an easier or better way to do it. p
Negative 3143 pSome Windows functions such as codeCreateFilecode could return a emhugeem variety of error codes when codeGetLastErrorcode is called, and its impractical to check for every possible error code  there is often not enough documentation, and new error codes are added frequently.p  pSome of them such as access violations or invalid parameters are due to programmer error and should not allow continuation of program execution. However, others are due to other factors, such as bad file permissions, sharing violations, bad file names, etc., which the developer has little or no control over.p  pI would like to handle all noncritical errors such as bad file names, while allowing critical errors such as access violations to crash my program.p  pIdeally, I would be sayingp  precode ... an error occurred.

Negative 3143 pIm designing the data model for an app with the LINQ to SQL OR designer and wonder is it possible to have many classes implement an interface or base class and store the implemented fields values in the DBp  pMost if not all of my classes need common fields to be stored that describe metadata about the object, such as when and by whom the object was created, whether the object was deleted and when it was last modified... The values for these fields would ideally just go into columns on the implementing classes tables in the database.p  pI know of the option to specify a global base class or interface in the .dbml file, but thats not very elegant since I will have some L2S classes that dont implement the interface.p  pI know that this is easy to do with something like NHibernate. Id just like to see if there is a way to do this with LINQ to SQL in an elegant way.p  pAny pointersp

Negative 3143 pJust a quick question In an OOP MVC application, one key principle is the seperation of responsibilities.

Negative 3143 pConsider this scenario. I have a small enterprise project dev environment. We use archiva as our artifact repo.p  pIngeneral, I would like to have PROJECTSPECIFIC profiles set up, namely because tests will differ on a perproject basis.p  pHowever, the one thing I would LIKE to have constant, is a profile in my settings.xml file, which is active by default, used for development. Do I need to have my team members manually edit that file and place their ARCHIVA credentials in there ldap system, so that they can access the internal repop  pShould I just not put a password on it My other alternative is using a master password to encrypt a shared password, so nobody could see it, yet they would all have generic readonly access to the internal repo for snapshot dependencies and stuff. However, then they would also need the securitysettings.xml file which contained the encrypted master password, and doesnt that defeat the purpose of that systemp  pfinally can multiple profiles be active at the same time, or is that unnecessary For example, if I have the dev profile active by default which contains the artifact repo settings, encrypted svn credentials for releases, and then I specify different profiles in certain POM files, am I only to pick ONE profile Lets say I want to use Bamboo for CI, and there are some test profiles which use the surefire plugin and whatnot. Will these profiles coexist with the activeByDefault DEV profile that exists in settings.xml, or can only one profile be activated at one time All CI needs is the SCM information, so technically it shouldnt need access to the internal archiva repo, so I suppose that if I was using a test profile automatically using CI, it wouldnt need anything from the  profile.p  pIm confused. Im so close to having a fully mavenmanaged build environment, just trying to iron out those few kinks. Thank you.p

Negative 3143 pI had thought I was clever. But in light of recent discoveries, Im not so sure any more. During the page life cycle, there could by any number of database interactions. Some back to back, others spread out. So I invented an object that keeps an instance of an SQL connection alive in the HttpContext.Items dictionary. Every db request then uses this connection and when the http request has ended, I properly dispose of the connection. Were looking at a couple hundred milliseconds the connection would be open, and with some heavy http caching, running out of available connections isnt a concern.p  pThe point was to prevent additional round trips due to the establishing of new connections. But when I stumbled upon the knowledge of connection pooling, I think it pretty invalidates the usefulness of preserving the SqlConnection. Or does itp  pIs scenario A the same as Scenario B, performance wise Which would you recommend Does scenario B provide no performance gains, and even possibly hinders it because of some edge cases where the connection might not disposed of properly Forgive the pseudoness in the examples, I dont want to clutter them with barf.p  pstrongAstrongp  precodeusing var connection  new SqlConnectionconnectionString     using var command  new SqlCommand..., connection           ... doing database stuff ...       ... traversing the stack ...  using var connection  new SqlConnectionconnectionString     using var command  new SqlCommand..., connection           ... doing database stuff ...      codepre  pstrongBstrongp  precode   var connectionKeeper  new ConnectionKeeper      Add to the context items so it can be used anywhere    Context.Items.AddConnection, connectionKeeper     ... traversing the stack ...     using var command  new SqlCommand..., connectionKeeper.Connection           ... doing database stuff         ... traversing the stack ...     using var command  new SqlCommand..., connectionKeeper.Connection           ... doing database stuff         ... traversing the stack ...

Negative 3143 pi am trying to load and initialize the addthis.com widget via ajax in order to be able to reset the email variables inside the addthisshare object dynamically based on user input. p  pso far i am succeeding in loading the widget via ajax, but when i load it via ajax the button which i need the most is no longer part of the widget. this is very strange as i am using the exact same script to load both widgets.p  pthe button which i need is the Email button. the widget itself has two email buttons one is called Email and the other one is called Email App. the Email one is the one which accepts variables which are passed to emails and the one which is not showing up when i load it via ajax. you can verify what email buttons are part of the widget after it loads by clicking on the widget on the  button itself and typing email in the search input field.p  pi have setup two js fiddles to illustrate the case. the first one loads the widget in the standard way and you can see both email buttons there. the second one loads the widget via jQuery getScript and you can see that only the Email App button shows up in it.p  p1 regular a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netFLAf4 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netFLAf4ap  p2 ajax a hrefhttpjsfiddle.net6QUWt5 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.net6QUWt5ap  pi know that this is addthis.com specific question  i tried posting this question on customizationqampa part of their website and so far nobody has commented on it. thanksp

Negative 3143 pWhen laying out a class hierarchy, I often find myself frustrated at the gap between being able to encapsulate functionality while also sharing code. Part of the problem, of course, is lack of multiple inheritance, but interfaces help somewhat. The inability to define protected methods on interfaces seems to me to be the bigger issue.p  pThe standard solution seems to be to have a public interface that is implemented by a protected abstract base class. The problem is when we have the followingp  precodepublic interface Foo      public String getName   abstract protected BaseFoo implements Foo      abstract protected int getId      private String name     protected BaseFooString name          this.name  name           Override     public String getName          return this.name        public class ConcreteFoo extends BaseFoo      public ConcreteFoo String name          supername           Override     protected int getId          return 4  chosen by fair dice roll.                    guaranteed to be random.         in the foo package with the classes above public class FooCollection      private static MapltInteger, Foogt foos  new HashMap     public static void addFoo foo          synchronizedfoos              foos.putfoo.getId, foo  cant call foo.getId                  client code, not in the foo package FooCollection.addnew ConcreteFoohello world codepre  pThat is, we return one of our nicelyencapsulated objects to caller, but then any method which gets that object back needs to be able to rely on some internal functionality. That internal functionality cannot be part of the interface that would break encapsulation, but to make it part of an abstract base class requires us to use casting.p  pWe cannot make Foo an abstract class because other interfaces need to extend it to add optional, orthogonal functionality to a more complex hierarchy than is display here.p  pWhat are the standard approaches to this problem Do you add getId to the Foo interface, even though clients shouldnt use it Do you perform an unsafe cast to BaseFoo in FooCollection.add If you check before casting, what do you do when the types dont match, even though they always should for all intents and purposesp  pAny information you have on best practices in this sort of situation would be very helpful.p  pbEditb In case its not clear, this example is intentionally oversimplified. The key point is that sometimes you return an interface view of an object. When that interface view is passed back in to a packagespecific class, the method it is passed to will likely need to use internal functionality in its implementation. How does one manage that mismatch between internal and public functionality p

The final answer is to clear out the state before the app closes with something like this.p  precodeApplicationDeactivated or Closing             SerializeToPhone save state to phone manually             var appService  PhoneApplicationService.Current             appService.State.Clear  codepre  pThis way, you clear out the objects so the phone doesnt try to manage state for you. Ive added my own code to save state to the phone using custom serializers and read from the phone on reactivate. I think if your app is simple enough, just some strings and numbers with no web security or facebook logins etc, you can leave it up to the phone to handle tombstoning.

Negative 3143 pIm using an external library that outputs a numpy array w data type u2 bigendian, unsigned, 2byte  16bit. In my case, only 10bits are effective the output is from a hardware device that actually outputs stronglittleendianstrong. For examplep  pcode65283code is the max value, corresponding to codebin652830b1111111100000011code as the direct python output, or code00001111111111code if it were littleendian.p  pI would like to map the range code065283code output from the library to the range code01023code that makes sense from the 10bit hardware capability. How do I do thisp  pIve tried the followingp  precodegtgtgtimport numpy as np  gtgtgtarrnp.array[65283, 6528, 652, 65, 6], dtypegtu2 gtgtgtprint arr64   same as arr26 and arr gtgt 6 [1020  102   10    1    0] gtgtgtprint arr.byteswap [ 1023 32793 35842 16640  1536] codepre  pBut this does not give the desired result. What Ive found is that the codebincode function outputs in bigendian format in the case of this numpy array, but with padded zeros omitted. For example, 65283 has all 16bits represented, but codebin65280b1100110000000code missing 3 zeros in the middle.p  pTo fix this and return a 10bit littleendian number, I can get the binary form of 6528, add 3 zeros in the middle, and do a byteswap. But 1 this is super tedious done per element and 2 the zeropadding is inconsistent e.g. 652 requires 6 more zeros.p  pIs there a builtin way to do this It looks like the codestructcode module w codepackcode and or codeunpackcode might help, but its Greek to me right now. Any help would be appreciatedp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pBelieve Ive found the culprit. My example above taking an actual value from the cameralibrary of 65238 and assuming semiarbitrary additional values, which just have the rightmost digit removed, obviously wouldnt happen e.g. 6528 requires a 1 in the leastsignificant byte code0001100110000000code and that would never happen only 10bits are effective.p  pUpon further inspection, a simple codearr.byteswapcode in my code where codearrcode has legitimate values works. e.g.p  precodegtgtgtarrnp.array[12288, 13312, 12800, 12032, 13312, 13824, 65283, 0, 7936], dtypegtu2 gtgtgtarr.byteswap array[  48,   52,   50,   47,   52,   54, 1023,    0,   31], dtypeuint16 codepre  pI had never actually tried that in my code, only in this madeup example. Sorry for the confusion. But hopefully it may help someone else stumbling around this problem especially if you use Basler cameras, which turned out to be trivial I guess...p

Negative 3143 pI have a question regarding hooks of Virtual Keys. Id like to define global shortcuts for my application  RegisterHotkey is not sufficient . However, I tried two ways to implement the shortcutsp  ol lipI registered a WHKEYBOARDLL hook. I put all the hooking code into a DLL and its working fine  But When special applications  e.g. CCleaner  have focus, the hook does not work any more Nothing arrives at my application. I tried it with 32 and 64 Bit DLL. pli lipI tried to solve the problem by frequently calling GetAsyncKeyState instead of using the hook. Also this version works well, until special applications  again CCleaner  gets the focus. In this moment GetAsyncKeyState returns 0 for all keys, even when they are pressed. pli ol  pDoes anyone have an idea how this problem can be fixed  p  pBy the way, it seems that the applications who disable my hook are written in Delphi are something else. These Evil applications do furthermore not react on any input, meaning a ShowWindow call on the windows of these applications does have not effect. The same for SetWindowLong and so on. p  pThanks very much for your response p

Negative 3143 pMy app has twitter integration using the IOS5 twitter integration which is very easy to use and implement. My question is, is it possible to implement a sign in feature using this framework similar to one used by TweetCaster. On that app, you sign in using twitter, you get a permissions page and if you accept you can post straight to twitter from the app. p  pWith my current integration in the app, you type in tweet in textbox in the app, click tweet button, then the Tweet controller opens up, and then you click the send button. p  pI would prefer them to compose the message in the app in a textview, a hashtag would be shown which would be added onto whatever they type then when they click send it goes straight to twitter without opening the twitter screen first.p  pDo these apps use the inbuilt twitter API with IOS5 Or do they use a 3rd party kit to handle this authenticationp  pEditp  pApples guidelines sayp  pAlthough you may perform Twitter requests on behalf of the user, you cannot append text, images, or URLs to tweets without the users knowledge. Hence, you can set the initial text and other content before presenting the tweet to the user but cannot change the tweet after the user views itp  pRegarding the twitter framework. So I am guessing that means I cannot just append the tag onto the end of whatever they type. p  pI was thinking would it be possible then to have the user type in their tweet, then when they click done, a new window would appear with a textview with whatever they typed with the hashtag I want added on. This textview would not be editable, to prevent them from removing the hashtag, then they click send which would go straight to twitter. Or would Apple guidelines still have an issue with this stylep

The function would change the colour of the console regardless if it was called with such an argument. p  pTherefore, I want to ensure the argument is something along the lines of codestdcoutcode, codestdwcoutcode, etc. I would prefer it be general in the case that more codestdostreamcode objects are added in a future standard.p  pI tried many things involving codestdissamecode and codestdisbaseofcode, when the former wouldnt work, just to eventually realize that it was pointless because any argument type inheriting from codestdbasicostreamltgtcode will be casted to the type Im comparing against when passed to the function, giving false positives.p  pThis eventually led me to my answer below variadic template template arguments Wow, thats a mouthful There are a couple problems, howeverp  ul liThe compiler must support variadic templates. I would prefer the solution work on MSVC.li liThe compiler gives cryptic errors in the case that a derived class with a different number of template arguments such as codestdostringstreamcode, which has 3 instead of 2 is used, as it doesnt get past the function signature.li liIts possible to redirect stdout, say, to a file, so even if the argument is codestdcoutcode, the same thing as the stringstream case happens.li ul  pI encourage people to post any other solutions, hopefully better than mine, and really hopefully something that works with at least VS11.p

Negative 3143 pStored procedures allow for better abstraction and separation of concerns from an application point of view. At my company, there is a tradition of having DBAs write procedures and do all the DB work. And, it is a model that works, mostly.p  pAs a .NET developer, I use Resource files to aggregate all my errorsuccessvalidation messages. This allows me keep my error messages standardized and centralized, so, once the implementation is done and we need to document the application messages, the process is straightforward.p  pHowever, our DBAs have a bad habit of scattering error messages throughout the procedures which makes it difficult to document a system. The current solution is to always return codeResultcode and codeMessagecode and use the Redgate tools to do search and find for those variables. However, this is tedious and it doesnt sound like a great solution.p  pI was wondering if there are any recommended practices to centralize the error messages on the database side, while still not degrading performancep

Negative 3143 pI have a question regarding the reuse of code among controller actions. I think it is a fairly standard situation, so I am interested in whats the best practice in Rails.p  pLets say I have a codefilmscode resource with a corresponding codeFilmsControllercode, which has a nested resource codecommentscode served by codeCommentsControllercode. The nested resource can be rendered on its own using its codeindexcode and codeshowcode actions. However, it should also be possible to render the comments embedded in the corresponding film page.p  pNow, the question goes, what is the best way to reuse the code from codeCommentsControllercode within codeFilmsController.showcodep  p1 Force the codeCommentsController.indexcode to render to a string and then pass it in a variable to the film viewp  pOr 2 call the codeCommentsController.indexcode directly in the film view as a kind of partial, executing the database queries from there p  pOr 3 create a separate method in codeCommentsControllercode responsible for the database handling, call it from both codeCommentsController.indexcode and codeFilmsController.showcode, and use the corresponding view in both the places, toop  pTo me the options 1 and 2 seem a bit messy, while 3 is not modular and involves some repeating of code. Is there any better way to accomplish thisp  pThanks a lotp

Negative 3143 pCurrently one of our Jenkins builds fails. I would like it to pass or show green when the build fails. At the same rate i would like our build to fail or show red when a case passes. The build I am configuring is our Known Issues Build. So only failed cases go in there. The goal of this build is for it to pass when it fails, since we know its broken. When our devs fix it the build should fail which means something is working now so that we may move it out of the build into our core build. I read an article on the wip switch and have successfully configured that into our build. I have been receiving emails that say Jenkins build is back to normal, which to me seems like it worked. However, when you look in the build itself it looks as if it fails. The build is flagged as red, which means it failed, and the tests say they failed. The only indicator they passed is the email I receive. But this is not the intended behaviour i am going for. The build seems to alert me that it passes but looks as if it fails. Is there a way i can make the red button go green, so when we look at our builds, we know when something is wrong. p  pRight now I added code exit 1code to the end of my command which is supposed to reverse the failed and passed flags.

Its kind of working, but I got some strange behaviour. I have put JavaScript code in calendar view. First time I load the page JavaScript shows in code source, and work. If I press previous or next week button, calendar controller returns me new view of calendar but without the javascript. I can not see JS no more in firebug.

JavaScript is wrote in calendar view, so why calendar action do not return JS more than the first time.p  pEdit I did several tests. My JavaScript for prevnext week button is in calendar view.

Negative 3143 pWhen I change the time zone on my computer when testing on the simulator or on the phone when testing directly on the phone, codeDateTime.ToLocalTimecode does not return updated results.p  pI register and successfully receive notification events for codeUIApplication.Notifications.ObserveSignificantTimeChangecode. In it I call codeTimeZoneInfo.ClearCachedDatacode which allows me to detect the time zone has in fact changed but this has no effect on codeToLocalTimecode. The codeDateTimecode I am converting is definitely of kind Utc tried codeDateTime.UtcNowcode for example.p  pI tried calling codeCultureInfo.CurrentCulture.ClearCachedDatacode as suggested in this question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10137383settimezoneinformationdoesnotupdatedatetimenowforanothernetapplicationSetTimeZoneInformation does not update DateTime.Now for another .NET Applicationa. That only causes the application to crash when the codeCurrentCulturecode is nulled.p  pDigging a bit deeper into the implementation of codeToLocalTimecode, it seems to use the object codeTimeZone.CurrentTimeZonecode. This object is reset only when the difference between codeDateTime.GetNowcode and codeTimeZone.timezonecheckcode. I suspect that codeTimeZone.timezonecheckcode is not getting updated when codeTimeZoneInfo.ClearCachedDatacode is called.p  pIs there any way I can force codeToLocalTimecode to take into consideration the time zone changep

Negative 3143 pI am using service bus queues to communicate between web role and worker role. I have two queues in my service bus. I am putting a message into the queue from web role and the worker role processes that message and puts another message back into another queue which the web role retrieves and sends to client. Both the web role and worker role threads are continuously runningp  pI want to know when the execution control is at QueueClient.Receive, does it wait till it receives the message or if there is no message on the queue then it moves to next line because in the situation when there is no message on the queue, i had put a breakpoint at QueueClient.Receive to check what happens next but the control doesnt go to next line it just disappears so i thought it might just be waiting. p  pBut in my web role below i am sending a message to worker role through service bus queue and am expecting a response again from worker role immediately but sometimes worker role takes a bit of processing time and the web role doesnt get it and the web role thread goes to sleep.p  pI am a beginner in windows azure, so am a bit confused about this whole problem.

Negative 3143 pLet me start by saying that my task is complete. But Im trying to get an understanding of how its working, and one thing is confusing to me. In other words, I stumbled on the answer by accident.p  pMy task was simple in an input box, mask the input as the user types, by changing each character to  after a delay. This is how android phones handle masked input, slightly different than iPhone.p  pI used a combination of jQueryjavascript and regex. My working codep  precode.roominput.focusfunction       currentFocus  this   .key.clickfunction       setTimeoutfunction           currentFocus.valcurrentFocus.val.replace[],      , 2000  codepre  pIts pretty simple, and it works great. When each key is pressed, it changes to  after 2 seconds. emEach key is on its own timerem. But there is one major thing I dont understand. When the callback from setTimeout triggers, the code above seems like it would set the ementireem contents of the textbox to s. Because the replace above replaces the entire content of the value with any characters not .p  pBut it doesnt. Each key changes after 2 seconds from when it was clicked as it should.  Why is that Im thinking it might be the regex  does it only change the first match it finds Did I just answer my own questionp  pUPDATE I did. Its the regex. It only replaces the emfirstem matched character in the string. I was thinking it maybe had something to do with singlethreading issues... as usual, Im making a problem much more difficult than it is. p

Negative 3143 pSo I want to write an automatic codecodep  precodetemplatelttypename U, typename Tgt bool operatorUampamp u, Tampamp t    return  stdforwardltUgtu  stdforwardltTgtt   codepre  pbut that is impolitesup1sup.

Sadly, it is a bit greedyp  precodestruct test   bool operatorconst testamp, const testamp bool operatorconst testamp, const testamp codepre  pas it will snarf up pretty much every codetest  testcode rather than the above codecode being called.  I think this is not desired  I would rather call an explicit codecode than autoforward to codecode and negate.p  pSo, I write up this traits classp  precodetemplatelttypename T, typename U,typenamevoidgt struct cannotequal  ... basically the same as canequal, omitted codepre  pwhich tests if codeT  Ucode is valid.p  pWe then augment the codecode as followsp  precodetemplatelttypename U, typename T,   typenametypename stdenableiflt     canequalltT,Ugtvalue     ampamp cannotequalltT,Ugtvalue   gttype gt bool operatorUampamp u, Tampamp t    return  stdforwardltUgtu  stdforwardltTgtt   codepre  pwhich, if you parse it, says this sentence is false  codeoperatorcode exists between codeTcode and codeUcode iff codeoperatorcode does not exist between codeTcode and codeUcode.p  pNot surprisingly, every compiler I have tested segfaults when fed this.  clang 3.2, gcc 4.8 4.7.2 intel 13.0.1.  sI suspect that what Im doing is illegal, but I would love to see the standard reference.s edit What Im doing is illegal, because it induces an unbounded recursive template expansion, as determining if my codecode applies requires that we check if my codecode applies.  The version linked in the comments, with codeif 1code, gives a sensible error.p  pBut my question is there a way I can convince my SFINAE based override to ignore itself when deciding if it should fail or not, or somehow get rid of the self referential issue somehow  Or lower the precedence of my codeoperatorcode low enough so any explicit codecode wins out, even if it is otherwise not as good a matchp  pThe one that doesnt check for codecode does not exist works reasonably well, but not well enough for me to be as impolite as to inject it into the global namespace.p  pThe goal is any code that would compile without my magic codecode does exactly the same thing once my magic codecode is introduced.  If and only if codecode is otherwise invalid emandem codebool r  abcode is well formed should my magic codecode kick in.p  hr  pFootnote sup1sup If you create a codetemplatelttypename U, typename Tgt bool operatorUampamp u, Tampamp tcode, SFINAE will think that every pair of types has a valid codecode between them.  Then when you try to actually call codecode, it is instantiated, and fails to compile.  On top of that, you stomp on codebool operator const fooamp, const fooamp code functions, because you are a better match for codefoo  foocode and codefoo a, b a  bcode.  I consider doing both of these impolite.p

So now I need to marry the question ID to the answer per User ID. p  pWhen I import, the column headers need to bep  precodeUser ID     Question ID    Answer xxxxxxx    xxxxxxxxxxxxx  xxxxxxxxxx codepre  pInstead ofp  precodeUser ID    Question ID 1  Question ID 2  Question ID 3  etc... xxxxxx    xxxxx           xxxxx          xxxxx          ... codepre  pAny and all help is appreciated, thank you. p
Negative 3143 pIm trying to write a query that compounds many MySQL Views. The MySQL version Im using is the latest that Amazons AWS RDS service provides.

Negative 3143 pI have multiple lua files which contain information I would like to extract via Python. To use Lua inside Python Im using a hrefhttpsgithub.combastibelunaticpython relnofollowlunaticpythona, but thats not a requirement  if you have other approaches that would also be fine.p  pThe lua files look like thatp  precodesource       licences           GPL,         MIT,     ,     env           MYTOOLVERSION  1.2.3,         OTHERKEY  OTHERVALUE,     ,     someotherkeys           ...     ,  codepre  pThe value Im interested in is codesource.env.MYTOOLVERSIONcode, while codeMYTOOLcodeis always something different. Since I have no experience in lua, I have no Idea how to tell it to get the value of the key which contains the string codeVERSIONcode. I read some tutorials about the codetablescode concept in Lua which still seems a bit weird to me, and I guess the functions codenextcode or codepairscode could be usefull for my case. Though those functions still confuse me, in the examples I found they are always used in loop, but when I do something like thisp  precodex  nextsource.env codepre  pinstead ofp  precodek, v  nextsource.env codepre  pit seems that codexcode now only contains the key, not the value. And when using codepairscode instead of codenextcode, I get a function, but I have no idea how to call it.p  pMy Pythonscript currently looks like thisp  precodeimport lua  with openprojectpath as f     script  f.read  lua.executescript  i  1  licences  []  while True     data  lua.globals.source.licences[i]     if data is None         break     licences.appenddata     i  1  version  lua.evalsource.env[nextsource.env] if lua.globals.source.env is not None else unkown, codepre  pWhich just gets the value of emanyem key in the codeenvcode table, not necessarily the one which contains codeVERSIONcode.p  pSo, what is an elegant solution to fetch the desired data of this file to use it with Pythonp

Theres some logic behind it so its not straightforward, but its not overly complicated either.

Thus, f.data is NULL, and the copy expression in the transform gets an empty sequence.  If I remove the entire when matched clause then the statement works.p  pWhat am I doing wrong  Or is this a limitation of DB2s MERGE statementp  hr  pI have tried to work around this by changing the simple when matched to something like when matched and f.data is not null but that has no effect.  I also tried changing the XQUERY expression to something like thisp  precodeifold then   transform     copy out  old     ... else  codepre  pThat didnt help either.  The only workaround I have found is to split the MERGE in twain.

I would expect the performance to be abysmal, however.  And this is the sort of hack that I usually interpret as a warning sign that theres a fundamental error in my thinking.p
Negative 3143 pIm looking for a good opengl using glut tutorial. Of course questions like this one have been already asked before on SO. I asked one myself once, and you recommended me a couple of them.p  pThe thing is  they all differ a lot, and they dont all work.p  hr  pFirst I wanted to learn something from this tutorial  a hrefhttpwww.arcsynthesis.orggltutBasicsTut0120Dissecting20Display.html relnofollowhttpwww.arcsynthesis.orggltutBasicsTut0120Dissecting20Display.htmlap  pIts very well and extensively described.

Negative 3143 pIve been playing with Derelict3ampglfw to use OpenGL in D according to a hrefhttpwww.dsource.orgforumsviewtopic.phpt6231 relnofollowthisa, if I want to use extensions, I need to create a context first, and this is done by creating a window with glfw and set it as the current context. After the context is created and set, I need to use codeDerelictGL3.reloadcode to load all the extensions.p  pNow, I want to do all the preparations before I create the window. One of those preparations is to load and compile all the shader programs. But this required the shader extension, which required codeDerelict3GL.reloadcode, which refuses to run without a context...p  pSo, Ive used this hackish hackp  precodeauto tmpWindowglfwCreateWindow1,1,,null,null glfwMakeContextCurrenttmpWindow DerelictGL3.reload glfwDestroyWindowtmpWindow codepre  pThis works  I can now load and compile the shader programs strongand only thenstrong open the real window.

Negative 3143 pWhat I am trying to do is write a for loop to create a certain number of divs. The number of divs depends on the information i have in a database. For example there are 15 checkboxes, i need a for loop to create a div for each checkbox the user clicked. Im not worried about the mysql side of things right now, im just focusing on the for loop. p  pSo i have a main div that is 800px wide. Lets say the user clicks 8 checkboxes, i want to figure out how to write a for loop that will create 2 rows of 4 divs, each 200px wide. so 4 divs on each row. It doesnt really matter what is in the div right now i just need to know how to tackle something like this. p  pAny ideas that will lead me in the right directionp  pHere is some codep  precodedocument.readyfunction     fori  0 i lt the number of checkboxes clicked i          body.appendltdiv iddiv i  gt       codepre  pThen div will have the same css code like width 200px blah blah blah...p  pI guess i need to get the checkboxes clicked from the database and make a div for each checkbox.p

The issue I run into here is that I cant figure out how to pass the current Row being looped by SUMIF into the function.p  precodePublic Function checkRangeCheck As String, R As Range As Boolean  For Each MyCell In R    If InStrCheck, MyCell.Value gt 0 Then         checkRange  True     End If Next MyCell  End Function codepre  pIf I could send Check to this function, well I would be set.p  p2 Replace the sumrange of the SUMIFS with a UDF that returns the range of rows p  precodePublic Function pruneRangePrunerange As Range, Criteriarange As Range As Range Dim OutR As Range Dim Str As String  ActiveWorkbook.SheetsVancity Trans.Activate  Loop through the prunerange to make sure it belongs For Each Cell In Prunerange       loop through criteria to see if it matches current Cell     For Each MyCell In Criteriarange         If InStrCell.Value, MyCell.Value gt 0 Then              Now append cell to Outr and exit this foreach                 Str  Str amp Cell.Address amp ,                Str  Str amp D amp Cell.Row amp ,             Exit For         End If     Next MyCell Next Cell   remove last comma form str Str  LeftStr, LenStr  1   use str to set the range Set OutR  RangeStr   MsgBox Str  Set pruneRange  OutR  End Function codepre  pThis works for a regular SUM loop, but for some reason it returns Value when I try using it in a SUMIF or SUMIFS. Another issue is that even in the SUM loop if use CC instead of C1CX where X is however many rows, it crashes excel or takes forever to loop through. Im guessing its because excel doesnt know when to stop in a UDF unless I somehow tell it top

Negative 3143 pIve got a uiviewcontroller with a scrollview in it and a few uiswitches in a blank test project to examine this problem. When I first push it it takes a third of a meg of memory and I dont get that memory back when I unload it. Subsequent loads dont take any further memory but I am unhappy about this wasted half meg, as I want to add more viewcontrollers and this is wasted memory as they might be used once in the early stages of using the app and then not for the rest of the several hours the app might be used. p  pSo whats going on, is the OS caching the viewcontroller or its controls If I strip it down to just a viewcontroller it only hogs about 20k post unload. Add 5 uiswitches and properties and nothing changes but when I connect them up to their properties and it goes up to 300k and with a further 5 controls goes up to about 550k. p  pIm setting them to nil in viewDidUnload, and nilling and releasing them in dealloc, and dealloc is being called on the unload. But despite this I am not getting the memory back. They are declared as properties not ivars, relying on automatic ivar creation and authsynthesised, and Im not directly accessing the ivars apart from in dealloc with release. Theres no reported memory leaks in analyse or instruments. Just this first time memory raid after which the viewcontrollers appetite for my users ram seems saited.p  pIn instruments none of my code is referred to on the stack trace apart from main and most of the loitering garbage seems to be from UIKit and similar.p  pAs I say my only suspicion that I can think of is that ios is trying to be clever and imagining I am going to reuse this stuff sometime but its simply a total waste of memory in my final app this will be taking at least 10 meg in total at this rate. If this is Apples choice is there a way to override it and force the memory to be returned to me p  pThanks in advance for any pointers this is driving me nuts.p

Negative 3143 pAssuming that time formats not timezone data, just plaintext Strings representing time in 12hour clock, what is the best way to parse that data examples belowp  pI feel like this is a pretty simple question, but Ive though about it a lot and cant figure out a foolproof strongprocessstrong for parsing out codehourcode and codeminutecode values from any one of strongmanystrong time formats.p  pIm using a simple form that allows for entering a time e.g., the time of a reservation, but there is no way to make the form field Google Forms, limited customizability anything other than plaintext which allows for any time format a person wishes to put in there a viable piece of data to work with.

After that kind of information is retrieved the problem could be solved by truncating the p.m.type sections, then codesplitcode to get the correct numbers.p  pI feel like the first approach is much more stable, but the second solution might be easier. Im not sure if there is a better way though, those are the two methods my n00b programmer mind could come up with.p

Negative 3143 pI have been tasked to work on a kind of parental control website. p  pThe user would enter a url on the site and press Go.

The control site would then do the request on behalf of the browser and process the response before relaying it back to the browser.

Negative 3143 pIm attempting to build a java application that trains an SVM model on a set of text documents and categorizes new documents based on the model. I have looked around a lot for packages in java that can do this and found the libsvm implementation the best. p  p1 My training input is essentially a text file that has the document text and the correct label. I understand that the libsvm package currently works only on numerical data which means I will have to convert my text file and the featureswords to a numerical form. Is TFIDF a good way to do this Is there a java library that can generate the TFIDFp  p2 The data has to be fed into the model in the form p  precodeltclass labelgt ltfeature 1gtltvalue 1gt ltfeature 2gtltvalue 2gt ...... ltfeature ngtltvalue ngt codepre  pIn my case the feature is a word in the document and the value is the TFIDF value.

As a result, I cant imagine the error is in the attached property. And, I read on a few forums where codepathcode is necessary to bind to an attached property, so I included that though it didnt make a difference. Changing the Mode OneWay, TwoWay doesnt make a difference. Binding with an ElementName didnt make a difference. I am wondering if this simply isnt enabled in Windows 8.0 WinRT.

Negative 3143 pCan I use generics to create a method that takes integer types, and is still be able to do basic mathematical operations inside the method on those typesp  pMy situation I wrote a method that takes a value of type int and returns whether the value is prime or not.

I have a strong understanding of ObjectOriented JavaScript, as well as jQuery, HTML, and CSS. However, I have very little experience with AJAX, and none with JSON syntaxapplication. Therefore, some aspects of this project seem very straightforward to me, and I do not believe I need assistance in figuring them out. strongThe things I already know how to do properly includestrongp  ul liDisplaying an error in red above the form retrieving the error information is a different storyli liDisplaying new users in the unordered list sectionli liHighlight the email input when an invalid email address is entered using clientside validationli ul  pThe issues I am having in understanding this project focus on submitting and retrieving the data that is entered in the form. It appears as though the function addUser first defines the variable response with a String data type version of an Object that contains keyvalue pairs of success boolean, error string or success boolean, user usernamestring,emailstring  Here is where I run into my first area of trouble...p  pIf the objects containing those keyvalue pairs are to be relied on for determining whether or not an error has occurred during validation, and to retrieve data such as error messages and strings associated with the username and email, it would make sense to keep them as actual objects, rather than stringified objects. As strings, I do not know how to access the value of a property of that object. If they were objects, I could simply refer to them using dot notation and retrieve their properties values. i.e. sampleObj.success or sampleObj.error It seems as though JavaScript functions such as eval and JSON.parse would suffice to return these strings into proper objects, but I have no idea how to implement those functions properly.p  pThe second major issues I am experiencing relates to the jQuery call of the .ajax method. I have a very rudimentary understanding of how AJAX operates, but the syntax used here confuses me. I understand that the data jsonresponse is being sent to the urlechojson using the typepost, but I do not understand how that data can be retrieved after this has taken place. I also do not understand what the value of response is referring to in that process.p  pFinally, I do not understand the use of a callback function at the end of the .ajax statement, and how it relates to the initial call of the addUser function as a result of clicking the form button input. I do not understand its purpose, or how it would be used syntactically.p  pI understand this is a fairly complicated project, and I may be asking a lot. But I have spent many hours over several days trying to make sense of this using my own knowledge and existing online resources, but have not gotten very far despite my diligence. I hope someone can assist me in understanding this example.p  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netbrianjsullivanCNBwU1 relnofollowA link to a live version of this project jsfiddle.netap  pEDIT An updated link to the jsfiddle workflow, with correct jQuery selectors and additional functionality for displaying error messages  user input a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netbrianjsullivan5vv5w relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netbrianjsullivan5vv5wap

Negative 3143 pThis might be either a simple or exceedingly complex question and searching has produced no results. p  pI use Sequel Pro on OSX to run a lot of queries some of which can take, e.g. 8 hours.

Negative 3143 pIn real life, transparency or opacity can be explained in a simple way by how much an object can reflect light, or how much of it pass through.  So if an object is transparent light pass trough it, reflect on whatever is behind it and the light get back to us.p  pHow computers simulate this behavior I mean, we as developers, have many abstractions and APIs to set alpha levels and opacities of our pixels but how computers translates this into a bitmap to the screenp  pWhat I think is happening Both back and front colors are combined to result in a third color and this is then draw to screen. Eg transparent white over back red on screen will be painted as pinkp

Negative 3143 pI am writing a bash script and I was looking for something that will allow me to send commands to a file that the program would read and perform. And I found a hrefhttpmywiki.wooledge.orgNamedPipes relnofollowthisa. From the beginning I started to experiment I realized that there is one big trouble if the input line is about 100 characters there is a 50 chance of that the reading from the other side will fail. Let me explain on example what happens.p  pTo begin with, we need a fifo and two oneliners for server and client respectively.p  precode creating fifo mkfifo pipe   ala server while true do      echo n Send to client gt      read      echo REPLY gt pipe      read answer lt pipe      echo Got answer answer  done   ala client while read lt pipe do      echo Finished reading.     echo FROM SERVER REPLY      echo ACK gt pipe  done codepre  pAssuming we did all this in HOME there shouldnt be a need to check if does the pipe exist yet or not. So, in simple cases like 123 or where are the errors it goes fine. But if you try to copy a fiveline paragraph from any article on wikipedia to send it to client, it will fail.p  pExample of what we could getp  pServerp  precodeSend to client gt 123 Got answer ACK Send to client gt         .    16,  20,  21,  22       [31],        ,    ,    ,   .   ,         .  ,   710     C, F, 4, H, A, B  D,     Got answer      1, 0 2, 2   3],       ,          . ,  1  C ,4 ,A  D,   Send to client gt codepre  pAnd on client there is onlyp  precodeFinished reading. FROM SERVER 123 codepre  pIt looks like server starts reading right after he sends its data, so client barely able to read something from the pipe. In the example above he wasnt been able to read anything. And this all also breaks text in multibyte encoding.p  pPut simply, it goes like thatp  ol liserver sends codeaaaaaaaa this is a very long line  aaaaaabcbcbcbccodeli liserver reads codeaaaa abcbbccodeli liactually goes at the same time with 2 client reads what server had not managed to read yet codeaaccbcodeli ol  pIn order to make server wait before trying to read the ACK from client, Ive tried to change pipes file permissions to make them act as a semaphore. The results were interesting.p  pSince we cant manipulate the permission to read because once forbidden from the server, client wont be able to read from the pipe well switch the codewcode flag.p  pHere are modified versions of client and server. NB change in redirection after the read command on the client.p  precode ala server chmod 644 pipe  while true do      echo n Send to client gt      read      echo REPLY gt pipe      chmod w pipe      until [ w pipe ] do          echo Waiting client to read what we sent          sleep 1      done      read answer lt pipe      echo Got answer answer  done   ala client chmod 644 pipe  set x  while read ltgtpipe do      echo Finished reading.      chmod uw pipe      echo       ls l pipe ampgtdevnull      echo FROM SERVER REPLY      echo ACK gt pipe  done codepre  pcodechmod 644code is here to be sure the pipe had right permissions whichever script you start first.p  pcodeset xcode in order to see the fun that will be there.p  pRedirection in client changed to codeltgtcode due to readwrite locks on the pipe. Im not sure how do they work, but reading on a client with coderead ltpipecode doesnt work after write permissions were disabled on the server.p  pMake sure your paragraph is big enough so the code echoing Waiting client to read what we sent executes.p  pIm not actually going to send emthat bigem data, I just think that accidental lag in IO may be the reason of this bug appearing even on short phrases.p  pNow the question why, if you remove the codelscode command, it stops working on big data p  pMy bash version codeGNU bash, version 4.2.451release x8664pclinuxgnucodep

How should I approach this problem The person logging in with their email doesnt have an account yet, so I cant just add a role like INVITEDUSER to their user document, so Im thinking about trying to store their status in their session, and checking that using symfony 2.4s allowif expression, but I get an error  p  blockquote   pFatal error Uncaught exception SymfonyComponentConfigDefinitionExceptionInvalidConfigurationException with message Unrecognized options allowif under security.accesscontrol.17 in CwampwwwvendorsymfonysymfonysrcSymfonyComponentConfigDefinitionArrayNode.php on line 306p blockquote  pMy security.yml file looks like thisp  precodesecurity     encoders         FOSUserBundleModelUserInterface sha512      rolehierarchy         ROLEADMIN       ROLEUSER         ROLESUPERADMIN ROLEADMIN      providers         fosuserbundle             id fosuser.userprovider.usernameemail      firewalls         beta             pattern              anonymous              formlogin                 loginpath beta                 checkpath betainvitecheck                 alwaysusedefaulttargetpath true                 defaulttargetpath              logout                 path logout                 target          main             pattern               formlogin                 checkpath logincheck                 provider fosuserbundle                 alwaysusedefaulttargetpath false                 defaulttargetpath profile                 usereferer true                 successhandler security.authentication.handler              logout                 path   logout                 target                  invalidatesession false             anonymous           login             pattern login             security false      accesscontrol           path beta, role ISAUTHENTICATEDANONYMOUSLY            path login, role ISAUTHENTICATEDANONYMOUSLY            path register, role ISAUTHENTICATEDANONYMOUSLY            path resetting, role ISAUTHENTICATEDANONYMOUSLY            path account, roles ROLEUSER           path wdt., role ISAUTHENTICATEDANONYMOUSLY            path profiler., role ISAUTHENTICATEDANONYMOUSLY            path profile, role ROLEUSER            path submit, role ROLEUSER            path submissions, role ROLEUSER            path uploadCredits, role ROLEUSER            path transactions, role ROLEUSER            path activity, role ROLEUSER            path browsejoin, role ROLEUSER            path browsefollow, role ROLEUSER            path browseunfollow, role ROLEUSER            path playerrating, role ROLEUSER            path , allowif BETAALLOWED  request.getSession.beta  codepre  pDoes anyone know why this is happening allowif seems to be a new feature so maybe someones bundle isnt playing nice with it Heres my composer.json file too, just in casep  precode     name symfonyframeworkstandardedition,     description The Symfony Standard Edition distribution,     autoload          psr0   src      ,     require          doctrinemongodbodm 1.0.dev,         doctrinemongodbodmbundle 3.0.dev,         php gt5.3.3,         symfonysymfony 2.4.1,         doctrineorm 2.2,gt2.2.3,         doctrinedoctrinebundle 1.2.,         twigextensions 1.0.,         symfonyasseticbundle 2.1.,         hipawaytravelmandrillbundle devmaster,         symfonymonologbundle 2.2.,         sensiodistributionbundle 2.2.,         sensioframeworkextrabundle 2.2.,         sensiogeneratorbundle 2.2.,         jmssecurityextrabundle devmaster,         friendsofsymfonyuserbundle 2.0.dev,         jmsdiextrabundle devmaster,         sonataprojectmediabundle 2.2.dev,         sonataprojectadminbundle 2.2.dev,         sonataprojectcorebundle 2.2.dev,         sonataprojectdoctrinemongodbadminbundle 2.2.dev,         avalanche123imaginebundle v2.1,         braintreebraintreephp  devmaster,         cometcultbraintreebundle devmaster,         paypalrestapisdkphp devmaster,         kmjpaypalbridgebundle devmaster,         hwioauthbundle 0.3.dev,         cbodenRatchet 0.3.0,         reactzmq 0.2.      ,     scripts          postinstallcmd [             SensioBundleDistributionBundleComposerScriptHandlerbuildBootstrap,             SensioBundleDistributionBundleComposerScriptHandlerclearCache,             SensioBundleDistributionBundleComposerScriptHandlerinstallAssets,             SensioBundleDistributionBundleComposerScriptHandlerinstallRequirementsFile         ],         postupdatecmd [             SensioBundleDistributionBundleComposerScriptHandlerbuildBootstrap,             SensioBundleDistributionBundleComposerScriptHandlerclearCache,             SensioBundleDistributionBundleComposerScriptHandlerinstallAssets,             SensioBundleDistributionBundleComposerScriptHandlerinstallRequirementsFile         ]     ,     config          bindir bin     ,     minimumstability dev,     extra          symfonyappdir app,         symfonywebdir web       codepre  pThanks in advancep

Negative 3143 pI have a processing sketch that pumps out basic serial commands to an xbee. Then I have two soon to be 3, maybe 4 arduinos with their own xbees who receive the data and do stuff.p  pThing is each Arduino has its own purpose, and therefore its own data packet.p  pSo, to implement this. Is there a way to send a message to a particular xbee I.e. can I assign the xbee an index or channel of some sort, then get the broadcasting xbee to send data to whatever index or channel it needs top  pOr, will this need to be implemented in the Arduino software i.e. Processing prefix the data packet with an indexidentifier and the arduino ignore incoming messages with that prefixp  pOr is there another option entirely Pp  pThanks in advance for your advice.p

I have implemented my app with one, but I find it clunky, having to pass in either the DB object or the ApplicationContext in order to access the DB but there are times when I find that I have redundant code.  Id rather have an extra layer handle the logic than copyandpaste it three times in an Activity.  In general, what do other people do  What do you recommendp

Negative 3143 pa hrefhttpsmail.python.orgpipermailpythonideas2013May020527.html relnofollowAccording to guidoa and to some other Python programmers, implicit string literal concatenation is considered harmful. Thus, I am trying to identifying logical lines containing such a concatenation.p  pMy first and only attempt was using codeshlexcode I thought of splitting a logical line with codeposixFalsecode, so Ill identify parts encapsulated by quotes, and if these lie next to each other, it will be considered literal concatenation.p  pHowever, this fails on multiline strings, as the following example showsp  precodeshlex.split Some docstring , posixFalse  Returns [,  Some docstring , ], which is considered harmful, but its not codepre  pI can tweak this is some weird adhoc ways, but I wondered whether you can think of a simple solution for this.

Negative 3143 pI am an experience programmer, but a newbie to IOS trying to finish off a game and am having trouble with memory running away. p  pThe problem I am seeing can be reproduced simply with al,most no custom code  To simplify, I started with the outofthe box apple sample project  openGlGame, which produces a single view of spinning cubes.  I then added a startup viewcontroller in front of the spinning cube viewcontroller. I then added a button on each screen with a segue and an unwind, respectively, so I could go back and forth between a blank startup view, and the spinning cubes.p  pWhen profiling this project using Allocations, every time I go back and forth between the views, the memory allocated for the coreAnimation object increases by over 10MB p  pThis is roughly the same thing that is happening in my game.p  pWhy is this memory running away  Is there something overlooked in the sample project Is there something I am overlookingp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 3143 pRight now, I am doing android software development with its remote service component. p  pActually, I have two remote services ,let me call them service A and service B respectively service A is declared before service B in the Manifest.xml file , which do two different things. p  pThe two service have the same attribute value of androidprocess both are remote. The two services function well in most of the situations. p  pBut I found that sometimes this situation happens with high possibility, actually, service A cannot start successfully. To solve this problem, I tried to change service Bs androidprocess attribute value. And to my surprise, everything goes back to normal. Both services works fine. p  pI thought Android system should allow two processes with same name but different pids exist. And the androidprocess attributes value should not be the cause of the problem. Is there anybody can explain why what I did can solve this problemp

Negative 3143 pIve been learning how to use ZF2 from the book Learn ZF2 Learning by Example by Slavey Karadzhov. In it, he shows how to build forms using annotations. One particularly helpful feature is the pattern attribute. If you add a pattern to the form, theres a really cool JavaScript function that checks does clientside validation. If a fields input doesnt match the desired pattern, a groovy little tooltip of sorts pops up pointing out the fields that have problems and telling you what needs to be fixed.p  pI was wondering is there a similar system in ZF2 so that, when a field is highlighted, a similar tooltip pops up to give hints on what exactly needs to be entered into a field For example, for a password field it could give the requirements for the password. And if this isnt built in, is there a module out there somewhere that does this Ive done a bunch of Googling on this subject, but Ive come up empty so far.p

Im no SQL expert and after doing countless google searches Im still nowhere close to figuring out why this is happening. p  pAbout six weeks ago a table was supposedly dropped from my database, not by me. After this table was dropped all the views that depended on it still functioned properly. This table was unused but still had a handful of dependencies as I can see now in the Object Dependency viewer in SQL Management Studio. We implemented a few updates to out SQL Server 2012 last night and the server was restarted. p  pAt about the time these updates were going on we started to receive a bunch of errors all revolving around this missing table that was deleted 6 weeks ago. After recreating the table everything was fine.p  pWere currently going through the updates to see if they could have effected it in any way. Does anyone know if there is any sort of caching that could have been going on that Im not aware of Im really stumped as to why this worked for those 6 weeks.p

Negative 3143 pWriting an LSH program in Java, during this first part I read through 5 different text files and pulled out all the unique words. Then created 5 different shuffling of the words.

The next time he comes back, he enters Netweb into the domain and presses return, it fills the password which was saved for that domain and then he can enter his username afterwards.p  pWhat can I do about this Is there a way to set the username so that it doesnt use the company or a way to use the top two before adding the passwordp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comWRPua.png altexample of username issuep  pMy code is belowp  precodelttr classcentergt     lttd classcentergtUser Name         ltbr gt         ltaspTextBox IDtxtUser runatservergtltaspTextBoxgt     lttdgt lttrgt lttr classcentergt     lttd classcentergtCompany         ltbr gt         ltaspTextBox IDtxtCompany runatservergtltaspTextBoxgt     lttdgt lttrgt lttr classcentergt     lttd classcentergtPassword         ltbr gt         ltaspTextBox IDtxtPass runatserver TextModePasswordgtltaspTextBoxgt         ltbr gtRemember me         ltaspCheckBox IDchkPersistCookie runatserver AutoPostBackfalse gt         ltbr gt         ltbr gt         ltaspButton IDbtnSubmit runatserver TextLogin CssClasscenter OnClickbtnSubmitClick gt         ltbr gt         ltaspLabel IDlblMessage runatservergtltaspLabelgt         ltbr gt         ltaspRequiredFieldValidator IDRequiredFieldValidator1 runatserver ControlToValidatetxtUser ErrorMessagePlease enter a user name ForeColorRedgtltaspRequiredFieldValidatorgt         ltbr gt         ltaspRequiredFieldValidator IDRequiredFieldValidator3 runatserver ControlToValidatetxtCompany ErrorMessagePlease enter a company ForeColorRedgtltaspRequiredFieldValidatorgt         ltbr gt         ltaspRequiredFieldValidator IDRequiredFieldValidator2 runatserver ControlToValidatetxtPass ErrorMessagePlease enter a password ForeColorRedgtltaspRequiredFieldValidatorgt     lttdgt lttrgt codepre
Negative 3143 pThis program is supposed to compare DNA strings.p  pInputbr 3br ATGCbr TACGbr ATGCbr CGTAbr AGQbr TCF  p  pFirst line represents how many times the program will be run. Each time it runs, it compares the two strings. A matches with T and vice versa. G matches with C and vise versa. So if the first letter of string 1 is A, the first letter of string 2 should be T. If the next one is T, the next one on the other string should be A and etc. If a letter other than A, T, G, or C appear, it is a bad sample. If its bad, print out bad, if its good, print out good.

Negative 3143 pBy no means, NewRelic is taking the world by storm with many successful deployments. But what are the cons of using it in productionp  pPHP monitoring agent works as a .so extension. If I understand correctly, it connects to another system aggregation service, which filters data out and pushes them into the NewRelic cloud.p  pThis simply means that it works transparently under the hood.

Negative 3143 pI want to create a cache in my web application, which will allow the top layer MVC to persist some values, retrieved from underlying layers services amp DB, in order to avoid  unnecessary requests to it. The data, that I want to store in cache, is needed on every page of the web site, so this cache is aimed to dramatically reduce the amount of requests. The idea is that a lot of threads will read the data from collection while one thread will clear it and retrieve new data after cache expiration. This means the collection will be used for strongfrequent readingstrong and strongrare writingstrong operations.  p  pThe problem for me is to choose the appropriate class for these purposes. I have read about the set of concurrent classes from a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.collections.concurrent28vvs.11029.aspx relnofollowcodeSystem.Collections.Concurrentcodea, introduced in .NET 4. I definitely dont need to use codeConcurrentQueuecode or codeConcurrentStackcode, but I have to choose between a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comrurulibrarydd26731228vvs.11029.aspx relnofollowcodeBlockingCollectioncodea, a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarydd38177928vvs.11029.aspx relnofollowcodeConcurrentBagcodea and a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarydd28719128vvs.11029.aspx relnofollowcodeConcurrentDictionarycodea.  p  pcodeConcurrentBagcode seems to be the best solution in this case. However, I read in a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combpfxteamarchive201001269953725.aspx relnofollowthis articlea that concurrent dictionaryp  blockquote   p... is entirely lockfree for read operations.  In this way, its optimized for scenarios where reading from the dictionary is the most frequent operation.p blockquote  pSo maybe the best solution is to use codeConcurrentDictionaryltint, MyTypeOfObjgtcode instead Or maybe I dont need concurrent type at all and simple codeListcode will do the job Probably, it would do if I can somehow lock operations with it for the time of cache update. But using simple codelockcode is undesirable.p  pAny advices and explanations are appreciated.p  h1Updateh1  pThe cache is used to store the map points of the outlets. The set of outlets is quite stable, but there should be a UI to add them, so insert operations are really rare. It might be even easier to retrieve whole collection from the underlying layer after timeout then perform insert operations. Search is not required as well, reading means simple enumeration.p

Negative 3143 pThis is for a Rails app, but Im just posting the SQL.p  pSo, this is my sanity test. It works, and returns two copies of the same model.

FROM followings JOIN outlets ON followings.followableid  outlets.id AND followings.followabletype  Outlet JOIN people ON followings.followableid  people.id AND followings.followabletype  Person WHERE followings.userid  1  gt []  Exact same result from removing the WHERE clause codepre  pThere are records for each join.

But then why is it working where codeoutlets.idcode code commentableidcode and code statableidcode at the same timep  pAnd, I just tried changing the codeoutletscode to LOJs as well, and that returned a list of results that is approximately double the length of the outlets table itself in about the longest SQL call Ive ever seen. So, while its progress I dont think its a general solution.p  pEDIT 2p  pThanks to testing things out with the accepted answer I realized that my choice of statistics was giving misleading results because each outlet has a statistic. When I changed to a better test table e.g. codefollowingscode both codeJOINcodes behaved similarly. And the codeUNIONcode method returns the expected entriesp

Negative 3143 pI have been handed over an application that uses entity framework. Im not familiar with entity and Im having an issue that I cant figure out. This application was made to migrate data from a database to a more relational database. After the initial migration, we have to run it again to insert additional rows that were not part of the original migration. There is a 3 week gap. I know that I have to put a check in and I want to do this by one of the columns we uses named DateChanged but unfortunately Im not sure how to do this in entity. This is my first effort and it just shows in red which is depressing. I have searched on the internet but have found no solutions. p  precode if newData.tVehicleLogs.Anyv gt v.DateChanged.Value.ToShortDateString6272014Im not sure how to check the DateChanged here.         newData.tVehicleLogs.Adddeal       comment  new tVehicleComment                 Comment  vehicle.Reason,          DealID  deal.DealID,          CurrentComment  false                newData.tVehicleComments.Addcomment         newData.SaveChanges        int cId  comment.CommentID        deal.CommentID  cId            codepre  pSo as you can see Im trying to check the date with the if statement, but I cant get the syntax correct... after trying everything I know to try .. which isnt much at this point. p  pI basically need to check if the DateChanged is from 6272014 to todays date. If its before then, then it has already been migrated over and doesnt need migrated over again. Where it says comment, if the row is new, then it inserts the old comment into the new comments table, then updates the tVehicleLogs table with the commentID. Im just stuck on the date checking part. Any help is greatly appreciatedp  pEDIT This is the entire code for inserting the into tVehicleLogs..p  precodeif MigrateLogs      ListltVLoggt vlog  oldData.VLogs.ToList      foreach VLog vehicle in

Negative 3143 pI coded a 3D application managing spot light shadow mapping. To do this I use classical shadow mapping technique I fill a depth texture in the first render pass and in the second render pass I compare the distance from light to the first occluder and the distance from the light to the vertex position to know if my fragment is in shadow or not.p  pHeres a screenshot spot light2D depth texture shadow mappingp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comWaUYy.png altenter image description herep  pIn this example I use PCF shadow mapping technique using the function textureProjOffset.

To do this in the first render pass I use a geometry shader to dispatch both the projection and view matrix provided by the 6 shadow frustrums all in ONE pass Its different of the technique concisting to fill 6 separate textures with this time 6 render states.p  pHeres a screenshot spot lightCube depth texture shadow mappingp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comFql2j.png altenter image description herep  pAs you can see, its only HARD shadow mapping. To recover the depth value encoded into the cubemap I have to use this time the function texture textureProj does not exists for samplerCube and samplerCubeShadow. Next I have to compute the distance between the light position and the vertex position in world space and then convert it into clip space because the depth value contained into the texture is already in clip space.p  pHeres a piece of code from the fragment shader to see the processp  pSampler usedp  precodesamplerCubeShadow ShadowCubeSampler[MAXLIGHTSCOUNT] codepre  pFor HARD shadowsp  precodefloat ConvertDistToClipSpacevec3 lightDirws      vec3 AbsVec  abslightDirws     float LocalZcomp  maxAbsVec.x, maxAbsVec.y, AbsVec.z      float NormZComp  NearFar.y  NearFar.xNearFar.y  NearFar.x          2.0f  NearFar.y  NearFar.xLocalZcomp  NearFar.y  NearFar.x      return NormZComp  1  0.5f   float GetBiasedCubeHardShadowFactorvec3 vertexPositionws, int idx      vec3 lightToVertexDirws  vertexPositionws  LightPosws.xyz     float LightToVertexClipDist  ConvertDistToClipSpacelightToVertexDirws      float LightToOccluderClipDist  texture         ShadowCubeSampler[idx], vec4lightToVertexDirws, LightToVertexClipDist      if LightToOccluderClipDist lt LightToVertexClipDist         return 0.0f     return 1.0f  codepre  pAnd know, what about PCF SOFT shadows using cubemap  I do some researches and apparently it does not exist any function to recover a texture offset like its possible using simple 2D textures and using in the fragment shader the keyword sampler2DShadow. Am I wrong  I hope so.p  pI think I have a solution of course if it does not exist any solution with cubemapp  pApparently, to recover a texture offset I will have to use 6 separate textures so an array of sampler2DShadow with a size of 6 and not a samplerCubeShadow. So I will have equally as uniform an array of matrix4x4 respresenting the representation of the world in light space like I did for spot light shadow mapping in my first case. And then I will use for the 6 textures the method textureProjOffset.p  pSo, What do you think Is it possible to do PCF soft shadows using cubemap or not If its not the case, is my solution correct  Is it possible to use a function like textureProjOffset using samplerCube or samplerCubeShadow Or is there an alternativep  pThanks a lot in advance for your helpp

I actually want to mount www.mainsite.commobilesite as base directory to open mobile views, but it only showing homepage as mobile view and clicking on links take me to desktop views of mainsite.p  pSome code from route.php goes asp  precode   config[default]  dealslocaldeals  takes me to homepage of mobile view    config[local.html]  dealslocaldeals     config[localpage.]  dealslocaldeals1    config[todaydeals.html]  dealstodaydeals    config[todaydealspage.]  dealstodaydeals1     config[getaways.html]  dealsgetaways    config[getawayspage.]  dealsgetaways1 codepre  pThese are some default routes which I need to change for mobile. I am new with PHP framework and apologise in advance if I am asking something silly. Thanks in advance for any help and suggestions.p

Negative 3143 pI am doing what should be a basic programming item but I seem to be missing something on how MVC works.  I have a web page that gets inventory items from a database and displays them.  I added a partial view that has a menu bar that I want to use on other views at this point not robust.  In the menu bar I added a text box and search button.  I want to search the inventory database for the text entered in the text box.  I cant seem to get the InventoryController to allow me to add a select statement so I can return the data to the list view.  Maybe the partial view and view dont interact like I hoped they would.  p  pShould I think of partial views added to a view as not sharing input data Can I do a selectfind search using this format or should I use multiple controllersviewsp  pList.cshtml     model WebUI.Models.InventoryListViewModel1p  precode     ViewBag.Title  Items   Html.PartialMenuView1  lth2gttestlth2gt      ltdivgt         lttable classproductTablegt             lttheadgt                  lttrgt                     ltth classitemgtItemltthgt                     ltth classdescripgtDescriptionltthgt                     ltth classcolorgtColorltthgt                     ltth classheightgtHeightltthgt                     ltth classwidthgtWidthltthgt                     ltth classdepthgtDepthltthgt                     ltth classmanufgtManufacturerltthgt                     ltth classmanpartnogtManPartNoltthgt                     ltth classbarcodegtBarCodeNoltthgt                     ltth classqtyOnHndgtIn Stockltthgt                     ltth classqtyOnOrdrgtOn Orderltthgt                 lttrgt              lttheadgt             foreach var p in Model.Inventory                              lttr iditemRowgt                     lttd classitemgtp.itemlttdgt                     lttd classdescripgtp.descriptionlttdgt                     lttd classcolorgtp.colorlttdgt                     lttd classheightgtp.heightlttdgt                     lttd classwidthgtp.widthlttdgt                     lttd classdepthgtp.depthlttdgt                     lttd classmanufgtp.manufacturerlttdgt                     lttd classmanpartnogtp.manPartNolttdgt                     lttd classbarcodegtp.barCodeNolttdgt                     lttd classqtyOnHndgtlttdgt                     lttd classqtyOnOrdrgtlttdgt                 lttrgt                      lttablegt     ltdivgt   ltdiv classpagergt      Html.PageLinksModel.PagingInfo1, x gt Url.ActionList, new page  x  ltdivgt codepre  pMenuView1.cshtmlp  precode     var inventoryItem       if IsPost      inventoryItem  Request[inventorysearch]   ltform methodpostgt     ltdivgt         ltulgt             ltli classmainMenuBargtlta hrefhomegtHomeltagtltligt             ltli classmainMenuBargtlta hrefInventorygtInventoryltagtltligt             ltli classmainMenuBargtlta hrefClientsgtClientsltagtltligt             ltli classmainMenuBargt                 ltinput typetext nameinventorySearch gtltligt             ltli classmainMenuBargt                 ltinput typesubmit valueSearch gtltligt          ltulgt     ltdivgt ltformgt codepre  pp  pInventoryListViewModel1.csp  precodeusing System using System.Collections.Generic using System.Linq using System.Web using DomainClasses.entities  namespace WebUI.Models      public class InventoryListViewModel1              public IQueryableltInventoryClass1gt Inventory  get set          public PagingInfo1 PagingInfo1  get set        codepre  pInventoryController.csp  precodeusing System using System.Collections.Generic using System.Linq using System.Web using System.Web.Mvc using DomainClasses.Abstract using DomainClasses.entities using DomainClasses.concrete using WebUI.Models  namespace WebUI.Controllers     public class InventoryController  Controller             private IInventoryRepository1 repository         public int PageSize  5          public InventoryControllerIInventoryRepository1 inventoryRepository                      this.repository  inventoryRepository                     GET Invenotry          public ViewResult Listint page  1                      InventoryListViewModel1 model  new InventoryListViewModel1                              Inventory  repository.inventory                 .OrderByp gt p.item                 .Skippage  1  PageSize                 .TakePageSize,                  PagingInfo1  new PagingInfo1                                     CurrentPage  page,                    ItemsPerPage  PageSize,                    TotalItems  repository.inventory.Count                                             return Viewmodel                    public ViewResult MenuView1string inventorysearch                      InventoryListViewModel1 model  new InventoryListViewModel1                              Inventory  repository.inventory                 .Select recieve and error that Select is a bad method                              codepre

Negative 3143 pI am new to spark and this is the first time I am posting here. p  pCurrently, I try to implement ADMM optimization algorithms for LassoSVM Then I come across a problemp  pSince the training datalabel, feature is large, so I created a RDD and cached the training datalabel, feature  in memory.  Then for ADMM, it needs to keep  local parameters u,v which are different for each partition . For each iteration, I need to use the training dataonly on that partition, u, v to calculate the new value for u and v. p  pHere, if u,v are not rdd, I can view them as a local variable, which is in the title. If u,v are rdds, then I come across a problem to handle two rddstrainingdata,u,v in one function. The detailed questions are as followsp  pQuestion1p  pOne way is to zip training data, u, v into a rdd and update it in each iteration, but as we can see, training data is large and wont change for the whole time, only u, v is small are changed in each iteration. If I zip these three, I could not cache that rdd since it changed for every iteration. But if did not cache that, I need to reuse the training data every iteration, how could I do itp  pQuestion2p  pRelated to Question1, on the online documents, it said if we dont cache the rdd, it  will not in the memory. And rdd uses delayed operation, then I am confused when can I view a previous rdd in memroy.p  pCase1p  precodeB  A.mapfunction1  B.collect    This forces B to be calculated  After that, the node just release B since it is not cached      D  B.mapfunction3   D.collect codepre  pCase2p  precodeB  A.mapfunction1.  D  B.mapfunction3     D.collect codepre  pCase3p  precodeB  A.mapfunction1  C  A.mapfunction2  D  B.mapfunction3   D.collect codepre  pIn which case, can I view  B is in memory in each cluster when I calculate Dp  pQuestion3p  pcan I use a function to do operations on two rdds p  pE.g   Function newfunrdd1, rdd2 p  prdd1 is large and do not change for the whole time training data, which I can use cachep  prdd2 is small and change in each iteration u, v p  pQuestions4p  pOr are there other ways to solve this kind of problem I think this is common problem, but I could not find any good solutionsp  pThanks a lotp  pHan p

Negative 3143 pWhen developing our Cocos2dx game for Android, we recently updated it to use only one set of high quality image assets resolution of 1536 x 2272, rather than multiple sets of image assets for different screen resolutions, and  using Cocos2dx setContentScaleFactor method, allowing it to scale the high quality image accordingly for the target devices screen resolution, like sop  precoderesDirOrders.pushback ipadhd  CCSize resourceSize  CCSizeMake1536, 2272 directorgtsetContentScaleFactorresourceSize.heightframeSize.height fileUtilsgtsetSearchPathsresDirOrders codepre  pStrangely, while testing the game, we seem to be noticing that some images, like menu buttons, game logo, game character, show up perfectly, but other images like scrolling backgrounds, splash screen image, dont show up at all. p  pWe thought such issues might end up occurring for devices with untested screen resolutions, but strangely, for an example, some images are completely blank  dont show up on an HTC ONE X screen resolution 720 x 1280, but show up perfectly on a firstgen Moto X with the same screen resolution. The same issue was noticed when testing with two Android tablets some images are completely blank  dont show up on a Lenovo IdeaTab A1000 screen resolution 600 x 1024, but show up perfectly on a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 with the same screen resolution.p  pAny idea why this might be happening Are there other factors we have to be taking into account when using one set of high quality images and scaling them accordingly based on the target devices screen resolutionp
Negative 3143 pIm using clang to spit out optimized LLVM IR for some C code and Ive hit a snag. Id assumed that, if I only passed functions to clang one at a time with the necessary dependencies declared, the function signatures of the resulting LLVM routines would be consistent with the functions Id passed in ie. same number of arguments with the same types. This works for the most part, except in the case of aggregate types. For examplep  pThe following C codep  precodestruct A      double x     int y   int fstruct A a      return a.y  codepre  pResults in the following LLVMp  precode Function Attrs nounwind readnone uwtable define i32 fdouble a.coerce0, i32 a.coerce1 0  entry   ret i32 a.coerce1  codepre  pThe struct has been expanded into consecutive arguments so that the function now appears to accept two arguments instead of one. Is there any way of preventing this type  of expansion Even if its some way of forward declaring the struct so that clang wont know about its constituent fields in order to expand itp  pThanks for the helpp

Every comment that is added regardless of the image its added to will be displayed on all other comments areas of all other images.  p  pWhat I want to do is make the comments area unique for each image that is uploaded.

Negative 3143 pI am coding a realtime, network program with UDP protocol using SFML libraries. The server will be handling all of the processing, sending packets to  the client and vice versa.p  pI need a method to synchronize the screen updates, because there will be a realtime user interface on both sides of the network. What I am thinking is, I will have the client and server open two ports, 1 for sending the packet and the other as a sort of verifying port.p  pOnce the updates are made and verified, both loops will send a byte over the network indicating that their side is ready. Once a ready side receives that byte, it will know the screen is ready to update on both sides, and then render the updates.p  pMy question is, how would I do this in C using SFML libraries. Is the logic correct, will I encounter network errors etc.p  pComment if anything needs clearing up.p

Negative 3143 pWe have observed one problem in Postgresql as it doesnt uses multi core of CPU for single query. For example, I have 8 cores in cpu.

When we apply massive query in single database connection to generate reporting amp observe at backend side, we see only one core is 100 used, where as all other 7 are free. Due to that query execution time takes so longer and our odoo system being slow. Whereas problem is inside postgresql core. If by anyhow we can share a query between two or more cores than we can get performance boost in postgresql query execution. p  pI am sure by solving parallel query execution, we can make Odoo performance even faster.

Negative 3143 pI have a visual studio 2005 project with has the following crystal reports dlls CrystalDecisions.CrystalReport.Engine, CrystalDecisions.ReportSource, CrystalDecisions.Shared and CrystalDecisions.Web. The project has alot of crystal reports and all the report loads succesfully on the VS 2005. I upgraded the project to VS 2012 .NET 4.0. I downloaded the SAP Crystal Report for Visual Studio .NET 4.0 and swapped out the dlls. When I build and ran the project in VS 2012 the reports does not load at all. p  pAny Idea why the new crystal reports are failing Any help is greatly appreciated.p

Negative 3143 pI am compiling a data base on Tennis players for a college project. I have two spreadsheets with lots of relevant information, one with performance related statistics for every ATP match played over the last five years and another spreadsheet with their ranking at that moment in time, handedness and the surface from that match over the same period.p  pI am trying to merge both spreadsheets. My problem is that although almost all the same matches are included, I am unable to match the data oneforone. The problem being that in one spreadsheet, the names are First Name Last Name i.e Roger Federerand in the other, the spreadsheet has the name as Last Name, first Initial I.e Federer R.. Also since there are many matches on the same day in the same tournaments, I cant match them up by date or tournament.p  pIve tried assigning numbers to players to match but came unstuck. I have also tried reconstructing the names in the first spreadsheet so that Roger Federer becomes Federer R., using codeMIDE3,FIND ,E31,255amp ampLEFTA1,1amp.code From there I thought I could simply use a VLOOKUP to match the data based on name and date. However some players Have Double barreled first names or last names. So for my purposes, JoeWilfred Tsonga would need to become Tsonga J.W. Or even more complicated Jabor Mohammed Ali Mutawa becomes Ali Mutawa J.M.p  pI think it would be too hard to reconstruct the names to match but I am wondering if there is any way to match the two sheets based on the last word of one cell and the first word of another e.g for JoeWilfred Tsonga, Tsonga would always be in both cells. The date can also be used since it will be the same in both sheets obviously.p  pI know this sounds quite sticky but I would greatly appreciate any ideas. p

Negative 3143 pIm using a hrefhttpfabricjs.com relnofollowfabric.jsa to build a designer for presents. To show a picture of the present to design, I use codecanvas.setOverlayImagecode. After designing the present I want to export the canvas to svg. The problem is, that the overlay image have to be bigger than the canvas. For instance the canvas should be 1500x1500px and the overlay image is 2000x2000px and the exported svg should have the size of the smaller canvas 1500x1500px not of the overlay image. Is there a way to do this with fabric.js or do I have to make a function on my own e.g. substract offsetX and offsetY from every x and y in the svgp

Because I select a TEXTFIELD which opens the keypad, the keypad opens over where I just clicked and there is no button highlighted.  If I roll over a button with the mouse then I can touch any button and it works straight away.  Otherwise I have to select a button first to highlight at least one and now I can touch any button. I have a feeling it may be still waiting on the textfield on the window before so that is why it only reacts to the second touch.p

Negative 3143 pIve two buttons and I want to put their tags Btn1.Tag adn Btn2.Tag into an array, so it becomes like codeobject[] arr  new object[] Btn1.Tag, Btn2.Tagcode and the tags value may change, depends on which method is executed. Since I want the array to be accessed throughout the same class, if I declare it in codeMaincode, it wouldnt work to be a global array. The reason why I want to make the array globally because certain statements in my codes can use codeforcode loop to avoid code duplication. For examplep  precodeif Btn1.Tag  myValue      toggleBtn1.Visibility  Visibility.Visible     textBox1.IsEnabled  true   else if Btn2.Tag  myValue      toggleBtn2.Visibility  Visibility.Visible     textBox12.IsEnabled  true  codepre  pBy using codeforcode loopp  precodefor int i  0 i lt 2 i     if Btn[i].Tag  myValue            toggleBtn[i].Visibility  Visibility.Visible        textBox[i].IsEnabled  true      codepre  pIve no problem in doing it one by one, I just wish that my codes look less duplicated.p  pIs it possible to do sop

And the answer was like thisstrong  Sorry for the delay in responding we were looking at an emulator image of another user that ran into this problem so I was waiting until we had the results of that investigation to report back.  We actually were not able to find anything wrong the emulator itself, our current hypothesis is that it is a network or adb problem interfering with GDBs ability to connect to GDB server on the remote machine.  Do you see this error every time you try to debug, or if you reboot the emulator will it work sometimes right after the reboot  Next time you see the error, can you open the emulators console mode by going go the HyperV manager and double clicking the emulator.  Then find the location your app installed to and run gdbserver version from the app path and let me know what it says  This will validate if the correct version of gdbserver is on the device.p  pstrongSo we are trying to solve this problem but Im also asking here just in case.

Negative 3143 pThere are some variations on this question on SO and floating around the web already but theyre a bit different and dont have conclusive answers.p  pBasically, Id like to change the UI Router state when a modal is opened. Then, I want two things to happen....p  pA If the user hits the back button Id like the modal to be dismissed and the URL to go back to the previous state but without reloading the previous state controller etc. I just want the overlay and modal removed because the previous state is already underneath the overlay and might have a form which the user is in the process of filling in for instancep  pB If the user dismisses the modal Id like the same to happen, the URL should change back to the previous one the modal could have been opened from anywhere so we cant hard code the state that it will return to and the modal should close.p  pA can almost be solved by using this code...p  precodeApp.run[   rootScope, modalStack,    functionrootScope, modalStack      rootScope.onstateChangeStart, function        var top  modalStack.getTop       if top          modalStack.dismisstop.key                ] codepre  pbut that will close the modal even if opening another popup on top of the current one because it doesnt know if were moving forward or backwards. Basically we want to say has the user hit the back button or has the state transitioned ot the previous state, if so, close the top modal.p  pB Im not sure how to solve. We could force a state change back to the previous state when the modal is dismissed If we knew what the previous state was, but the code for A above would then get triggered and possibly remove another modal from the stack. Also, the previous state would get reinitiated. Basically we want to just want to go back to the previous URL when the modal is closed, but without doing a full state change, if that makes sensep  pLike I say, there are some semi solutions out there, but nothing which seems to handle the above scenarios. Anybody got any ideasp

Now, I want the interior to have smaller dimensions than the world, so I want to change the game size when I start this new state.p  pI tried thisp  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodejs langjs prettyprintoverridecodecreate function    game size was 1000x700, I want to scale it to 700x450   game.width  700   game.height  450      rest of creation code... codepre div div p  pI also tried things like changing camera bounds, world bounds, world size, but method above shows the most promise.p  pThe problem, however, is that the resize for some reason does not show until I click away from my browser tab and back. Calling game.width in the console yields 700 at all times, but it doesnt show it as such until tabbing out and back.p  pOn top of that, the contents of the game floor, furniture are scaled down when the game resizes, defeating the purpose. I dont understand why it would, since theres no scaling anywhere in my code.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.p
