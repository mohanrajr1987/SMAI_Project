When Im connected to internet, it works as expected. I also tested demos from archive of calendar, its doing the same. I checked links for stylesheets and scripts files but I didnt find any of them loaded from online sources. Google Calendar I wont use so I think that there can be some solution but I dont know where is the problem. Thanks for any response.p

Positive 45217 pI have just installed zurbfoundation into my rails project that was already using Fullcalendar. After the install i immediately noticed that most of fullcalendars styling was messed with, some really obvious bugs occuring shaded areas now only half covering dates, button hoverstate is now half filled blue for no reason. Ideally id like my jsscss framework to have no effect on fullcalendars and other js plugins styles.p  pThere are a couple of potential solutionsp  pI could only take in bits of foundations SCSS and javascript so that i avoid the conflicting areas. I can find how to do this for the JS, but the SCSS doesnt seem to work when i remove  require foundation it seems to keep the scss there anyway, even when i try deleting the cache.p  pI could find the culprit areas of foundation and change them, but i dont really know where to start with that, the foundation file structure is weirdp  pLastly, i could ditch the framework all together and use something less invasive. As i can deal with making my own grid, and my own media queries, i have at least one front end man telling me to ditch frameworks all together, but i am just not much of a designer, so i was after buttons and navbars that look good out of the box. Are there good recommendations for lighter weighted sass frameworks that wont mess with stuff so much Or should i just roll up my sleeves and style my own buttons from scratch...p

Positive 45217 pHi Im working with JQuery fullCalendar in Angularjs and need some help with some table styling. The fullcalendar uses its own css file from the plugin that can be seen a hrefhttpcdnjs.cloudflare.comajaxlibsfullcalendar2.4.0fullcalendar.css relnofollowherea.p  pThe problem is that in the projectwebsite there are others stylesheets, among them a stylesheet created to make tables responsive. I cant control which stylesheets the HTML has access to. And this makes the calendar use an entirely other unlogical styling in small window size.p  pSo is there any possible way to force the controller to look away from some stylesheets or style the calendar own stylesheet in such a way that it will be the controlling stylep  pEdit Forgot to say that the aforementioned stylesheet is styling tables in general without any classnames and since its very much used throughout the website changing that into classes isnt really viable at this point.p

Positive 45217 pI have a fullcalendar, and Im able to enter events in it. But, when I enter events, without a time, they appear to end one day earlier, so when I have the enddate of 20150905, it ends on the 4th. of September, not on the 5th... I think its because its the end, so on that day, its over, so it ends one day before, but I dont want that behaviour, I want to have it shown, like the day you provide for the end is still in the time the event runs. The interesting thing is, that if I provide a time like 20150905T140000, it works, because it definetely ends on the provided day. p  pThe question now is How can I change this behaviour, so the event is displayed with the right timep  pstrongeditstrong the problem is really, that the day you provide, is exclusive, so its not in the time any more. p  blockquote   pend    The exclusive datetime an event ends. Optional.p blockquote  pThe question is, how can I change this behaviour...p  pstrongedit2strong I tried something like p  precodevar endsplit  enddate.split endsplit[2] parseIntendsplit[2]parseInt1 enddate  endsplit[0]    endsplit[1]    endsplit[2] codepre  pthis now, and it works in general, but has issues, if enddate is the 30th of a month, because then the end date saved will be the 31th, and this doesnt exist always...., so this solution wont work...p
Positive 45217 pI have a configuration off FullCalendar like this p  pimg srchttpimg11.hostingpics.netpics168785Capture.png altcalendarp  pI would like to put the event Event 1 on the background and the grid on the foreground.p  pSo that the event will be behind the grid.p
Positive 45217 pI would like to be able to force the calender to display the last week of the previous month and continue display the rest of the current month for every month.p  pFor example, if the current month is september, the first case top left should be 25th of august and continue 26,27....until the 24th of september or the rest of it if not possible to set an end date.

Negative 45217 pI really hate this error, because it can be so hard to pin point.p  pIn this case, I have a page with a user control on it that contains a gridview.  When a button is clicked to view one of the records in the gridview, a popup window in the form of a modal dialog opens allowing the user to edit the fields.  Then, when the popup is closed, the buttons server side code is fired, ultimately leading to a line of code that calls GridView1.databind.  When this line of code is fired, I will get the invalid postback error.  If this one line is commented out, I dont get the error.  This happens whether or not I actually make any changes in the popup.  And at no point is there clientside code modifying the values in my controls.p  pSo, it seems that something has changed with the gridview that it doesnt like.  I think it might have to do with the ObjectDataSource that its using.  I noticed that before the gridview is databound, the ODS InputParameters are set using Session values.  In any case, something is changing there thats causing this error.

Is relational the way to go Im imagining a simple twocolumn table or is there a NoSQL option better suited to this taskp  pWhen I say better, I mean more conceptually suited to the task. Im not really concerned with scalability, just simplicity and an obvious conceptual mapping to the task at hand. In the way that, for me at least, CouchDB maps much more sensibly to a blog than MySQL does.p

Negative 45217 pIm building an MVC 2 app and using linq to sql with stored procs.p  pI created a data access layer that has an internal datacontext class and a public class that I expose applications.  In my public class I expose methods which access the datacontext class and convert the data to my own object model classes using linq.p  pIn my public class, I would expose a method using the following patterp  precodepublic IEnumerableltMyObjectgt ListObjectsint iParameter      using MyDataContext db  new MyDataContext              call stored proc and convert results to my object model         return db.ListObjects.Selecto gt new MyObject                              ID  o.ID,                 Name  o.Name                 Text  o.Code     o.Description                     codepre  pMy MVC app would call this method from a model class, and the aspx would iterate through the results.  I found that I always get an error datacontext causes Invalid attempt to call Read when reader is closed because I wrap my data context usage inside a using scope.  If I dont scpope everything in a using clause it works fine.  Why is thisp  pI emthinkem this is not necessarily a linq or mvc thing but dont know for sure,  is the using clause causing the dispose to be called before all the objects are returned  Or maybe the select clause is only executing as the enumerator is being iterated through similar to how yield worksp

Negative 45217 pThe software is a classic search engine. There is one portion of the app that is tasked with crawlingcollecting data, and there is another that takes that data and builds an index or database. The final portion handles queries from clients, and performs a search on the data, before retrieving the results.p  pThe specific engine that Im discussing is one where the data is frequently updated at least once per minute so the queries must always be operating on the latest data.p  pMy question is simple. Should these three tasks be handled by three separate processes, or a single process with multiple threads dedicated to eachp  pThe main reason for my question is regarding the best way to partition memory. If the searcher has to update the available data for the indexer, and the indexer has to update the datasets for the query handler, would it make sense for them all to live under the same process and have the same address space Or would it be acceptable to have separate processes that use shared memory mapped filesp  pI am leaning towards separate processes so that each can live on a different machine, enabling clustering, distribution, etc. But in terms of raw speed for smaller datasets, would a consolidated approach be preferredp  pThe OS is Windows, the language is C. p

Negative 45217 pIm building my second app, and Im trying to learn from the places I stubbed my toes on the first one.p  pJust as in the last app, I have sections of my app that feature a view with buttons along the bottom basically a custom tab bar that trigger the switching of the contents of the main, big area of the screen. One is a map view, one is a table view, one is a grid view, looking at the same objects in three different ways.p  pIn my last app, I had each of the content options be a separate view, managed by separate ViewControllers. That worked, but there were places it was awkward. Passing data among those VCs was a little tricky especially passing back upstream, and I was totally confused by my nested view controllers not having access to self.navigationController, for instance. It could be argued that I now know how to work with that scheme and I do, but Im interested in a Better Way.p  pIm now thinking, maybe that whole thing should be ONE view controller, and it should have separate toplevel UIView objects that it swaps in and out when the tabs at the bottom are clicked. p  pProblem is, two of my nested views have tables on them. So Id need to either write REALLY complex UITableViewDelegate methods to figure out which table Im talking about, or create separate UITableViewController subclasses to manage my table data. Either way, this just eliminated most of the simplicity I was hoping to achieve by keeping it all in one View Controller.p  pThe other thing is, having those content views be UIViews inside the same view controller has some ramifications. Theres no load time to swap views, but Im burning memory I dont need to, if the user never visits one or more of those view alternatives.p  pThoughtsp

The pattern Id be searching for would be a sequence two random bytes with 0x55 occurring every two bytes.p  pThat is, search for tables stored in the file with 0x55 being the delimiter, and then save the data contained in the tables or otherwise manipulate it.p  pWould the best option be simply going through every individual byte one at a time, and then looking ahead two bytes to see if the value is 0x55, and if it is, then looking ahead again and again to confirm that a table exists in that locationp  pLoad the whole thing fseek  Buffer chunks, searching those one byte at a timep  pWhat would be the best way of looking through this large file, and finding the pattern, using C or Cp
Negative 45217 pI need to reset a boolean field in a specific table before I run an update. The table could have 1 million or so records and Id prefer not to have to have to do a select before update as its taking too much time.p  pBasically what I need in code is to produce the following in TSQLp  precodeupdate tablename  set flag  false  where flag  true codepre  pI have some thing close to what I need here a hrefhttpwww.aneyfamily.comterryandannpost200804BatchUpdatesandDeleteswithLINQtoSQL.aspx relnofollowhttpwww.aneyfamily.comterryandannpost200804BatchUpdatesandDeleteswithLINQtoSQL.aspxa but have yet to implement it but was wondering if there is a more standard way.p  pTo keep within the restrictions we have for this project, we cant use SPROCs or directly write TSQL in an ExecuteStoreCommand parameter on the context which I believe you can do.p  pIm aware that what I need to do may not be directly supported in EF4 and we may need to look at a SPROC for the job [in the total absence of any other way] but I just need to explore fully all possibilities first.  In an EF ideal world the call above to update the flag would be possible or alternatively it would be possible to get the entity with the id and the boolean flag only minus the associated entities and loop through the entity and set the flag and do a single SaveChanges call, but that may not be the way it works.p  pAny ideas,p  pThanks in advance.

Negative 45217 pIve received a LOT of help from just searching and reading this forum in the last couple years An amazing resource, even for the experienced developer. So, thanks Now I have a problem I cannot seem to solve.p  pI have a working iPhone app with a UITabBarController. It all works fine. The app has more tabs than can be shown across the portrait width of the display, so we see 5 tabs in total the last being the more tab. The thing is, we want to relegate some of the less interesting things to be behind the more tab. I know that if I had just 2 view controllers, then Id see just 2 tabs, and so on until I exceeded 5 tabs.p  pHow can we show just 4 tabs 3 plus a more tab, instead of 5p  pMy guess is this is not possible by just setting an attribute which would certainly be convenient, since I cannot find anything in the docs, or here frankly, to suggest otherwise.p  pShort of implementing my own more tab, and supplying the tab bar controller with only 4 view controllers the last being my own more controller, any tips, tricks, or hints are appreciated.

Negative 45217 pMost examples if not all that I see are the sort of a function that does some sort of computation and finishes. In that aspect, FP shines. However, I have trouble seeing how to apply it in the context of an enterprise application environment where theres not much of algorithms going on and a lot of data transfer and services.p  pSo Id like to ask how to implement the following problem in FP style.p  pI want to implement an events bus service. The service has a coderegistercode method for registering listeners and codepublishcode for publishing events.p  pIn an OO setting this is done by creating an EventBus interface with both methods. Then an implementation can use a list to hold listeners that is updated by coderegistercode and used in codepublishcode. Of course this means coderegistercode has a side effect. Spring can be used to create the class and pass its instance to publishers or subscribers of events. p  pHow to model this in FP, given that clients of the event bus service are independent e.g., not all are created in a test method As far as I can see this negates making register return a new instance of EventBus, since other clients already hold a reference to the old instance and e.g., publishing to it will only publish to the listeners it knows ofp  pI prefer a solution to be in Scala. p
Negative 45217 pI have working activity with 12 spinners that are linked to a single database table of over 20,000 records. Each spinner is bound to a different query to make the selections dynamic based upon the prior selections. The code works but Im having awful performance due to the number of queries and size of the table in the database. The initial layout takes 20 seconds to load. That is because the first spinner is set to an initial selection during the layout which causes the 11 other spinners to populate as well. Performance is also affected when using the spinners. If I go to change the first selection, it takes approximately 10 seconds for all the other spinners to update.p  pWhere should I start in looking for better performance The database table The queries Or should I avoid using 12 spinnersp

Negative 45217 h2Usless Background Infoh2  pHello, all. This is my first post here, but I often come here for help. I am an amateur web designer and have been in web designing for almost a year now.p  h2The Problemh2  pMy question is about CSS3 transforms. I have a small, circular element in the center of my page that transforms successfully when I hover over it. I have a larger circular element that is, by zindex, underneath it. The larger circle also has CSS3 transforms coded in the CSS, but will not transform, or even triggerd when hovered over. Both circles are overlaid, with the smallest on top, to create concentric circles.p  h2My Attempted Solutionh2  pOne word Zindex. I have tried putting the larger circle on top, which works fine. The problem with this is that the smaller circle no longer triggers...p  h2The Result I Wanth2  pI would like for the circles to remain in their concentric positions and for the larger circle on the outside to transform by hover. Is it possible to have an alternate trigger e.g. in JavaScript, I can trigger an animation by hovering over any element that I specify. Is this possible to do in CSS Can I hover element I, and change properties for element II If I cannot do this, how would I go about triggering animations for both circles, by hovering over only one I am trying to stay with pure CSSHTML, but I will accept JavaScript answers.p  h2Last Notesh2  pI hope I have provided ample info for a decent answer... Here is a screenshot a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comWPj62.png relnofollowhttpi.stack.imgur.comWPj62.pnga The circle with the infinity sign is the smaller circle element.

Negative 45217 pI am just starting out with backbone and am trying to set up a view which has a question list. To the left of the list I have four filters, to filter the list by language, country, status, and study. The list and each of the filters are loaded into their own collections.p  pMy idea was to make this one view with multiple collections, but I wonder if this is best practice in backbone since all the examples I have seen only have one collection per view.p  pAnother idea was to break in into two views with one being responsible for the filters and then a child view being responsible only for the list of questions.p  pOr, is it more backbone style to drop all of the collections into a model and then pass that model to my view like it mentions here a hrefhttpdocumentcloud.github.combackboneFAQnestedhttpdocumentcloud.github.combackboneFAQnestedap  pThanks for your ideas.p

Negative 45217 pIve been looking everywhere for examples on how to deal with TCP message framing. I see many examples where NetworkStreams are passed into a StreamReader or StreamWriter object and then use ReadLine or WriteLine methods for n delimited messages. My application protocol contains messages ending in n so the NetworkStream seems to be the way to go. However, I cant find any specific examples on the proper way to handle all of this in combination with asynchronous sockets. When ReceiveCallback is called below, how do I implement the NetworkStream and StreamReader classes to deal with message framing According to what Ive read, I may get part of one message in one receive and the rest of the message including the n in the next receive. Does this mean I could get the end of one message and part of the next message Surely, there must be an easier way to handle this.p  pI have the following codep  precode    private void StartReadSocket socket              try                      StateObject state  new StateObject             state.AsyncSocket  socket              socket.BeginReceivestate.Buffer, 0, StateObject.BufferSize, 0, new AsyncCallbackReceiveCallback, state                  catch SocketException                      mSocket.ShutdownSocketShutdown.Both             Disconnect                    private void ReceiveCallbackIAsyncResult ar              try                      StateObject state  StateObjectar.AsyncState              int bytesread  state.AsyncSocket.EndReceivear              char[] chars  new char[bytesread  1]             System.Text.Decoder decoder  System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetDecoder             int charLength  decoder.GetCharsstate.Buffer, 0, bytesread, chars, 0              String data  new Stringchars              ParseMessagedata              StartReadstate.AsyncSocket                  catch SocketException                      mSocket.ShutdownSocketShutdown.Both             Disconnect               codepre

Negative 45217 pI have a basic site with a header, a main application window with a bunch of jQuery and multiple divs in one container, and also a footer with a few links, these only take up about 620px in height and what Id like is to have my page cut off at about the 625px mark but I cant seem to get around having a white space at the bottom if I set my background image to 100 and its container to 625px.  p  pThis only happens when I maximize the resolution of my browser window via full screen mode in firefox if it matters, I leave it in regular viewing mode, my page looks great but this got me thinking that the white space at the bottom would probably show for other ppl with higher resolution.  If I set the height of my background container to 768px, no white space wfull screen but I get a vertical scroll bar and a bunch of useless space at the bottom. This makes the site look kind of weird because theres only one window which acts as an application with multiple animations.p  pIs there a method for ending a page at a specific px dimension and still have it fit with a high resolution screen without having to reflow the entire page  I only ask because I have a lot of absolute divs and reflowing them to re size accordingly will not look very attractive.  Why not  just use flash  Because I like to use Javacript whenever possible to avoid depending on Adobe flash player. p  pThanksp

Negative 45217 pIve been using reddit as my help recently, and theyve been great but then I found this site and feel its a much more appropriate place to ask my questions.  Hopefully the helpfulness trend continues here.  Let me start by saying I know this project is pretty intensive considering I have never done anything like it before, however that doesnt change the fact that I am doing it and I am willing to learn how.p  pI am designing a website which will feature the the bar and dining specials for my city.  Users will be able to log on, and the home page will display the top 5 rated bar specials happy hours, and the top 5 dining specialshappy hours for that dayi.e. monday, tuesday, etc..  Each special will have an up down rating for the user to give their input on the special.p  pA bar page will list all of the bars and their specials for that day, and the option to upvote or downvote the special.  Same thing with a dining page.  From there, the person can click on the bar name to be taken to a page specifically about that bar.  That page will show the specials for the entire week.p  pIm in the process of designing the MySQL table now in phpmyadmin, as it seems like thats where I need to start after having written the html and css for the design.  Ive tried googling for a framework that I could build off of, however I didnt come up with anything relevant.  p  pWould it be best to make separate tables under each database for each day of the week, put everything into one table, or another way entirely.  This is what I made so far, let me know if I am on the right track or not.  Thanks a million httpdl.dropbox.comu16887445Screen20shot202011070620at208.01.1020PM.pngp

Negative 45217 pI have a strange caching issue going on with IE9.  The other day I set up a new website on my IIS server that was NOT running HTTPS, unfortunately I accidentally setup a redirect to HTTPS if you entered in HTTP.  So because I didnt have it setup, the webpage didnt load becasue no HTTPS was running.

For some reason in IE9 it just wont load the webpage I think it is still trying to hit it on HTTPS.p  pI have tried clearing all temp filescookies etc.., rebooted and still no luck. The only way I have been able to get IE9 to hit the web page was by going into F12 Developer Tools and turn on Always refresh from server under the Cache menu option.

I turn it off and I cannot hit the website again.p  pIs there some other cache for IE9 that I dont know about that doesnt get cleared through normally processesp

Negative 45217 pIf you recursively traverse a directory tree by the obvious method, youll run into trouble with infinite recursion when a symlink points to a parent directory.p  pAn obvious solution would be to just check for symlinks and not follow them at all. But that might be an unpleasant surprise for a user who doesnt expect what behaves for other purposes like a perfectly normal directory to be silently ignored.p  pAn alternative solution might be to keep a hash table of all directories visited so far, and use this to check for loops. But this would require there to be some canonical representation, some way to get the identity, of the directory you are currently looking at regardless of the path by which you reached it.p  pWould Unix users typically regard the second solution as less surprisingp  pIf so, is there a way to obtain such a canonical representationidentity of a directory, thats portable across Unix systems Id like it to work across Linux, BSD, Mac OS, Solaris etc. I expect to have to write separate code for Windows.p
Negative 45217 pIm looking at developing an application that will include a CMS. Im a seasoned web forms developer but only really just moving into MVC.p  pI have a couple of questions that I hope some of you guys can answerp  pFirst, my current web forms CMS allows users to create a page, and then drop any number of user controls onto that page they have created. The way I do this is to create an entry in the DB together with the path and then use the LoadControl method.p  pI can see I can do this with partial views, but partial views have no code behind. If Ive potentially got 100 controls that people can drop onto a page, does this mean that the ViewBag in the controller needs to cater for all 100 controls just in case they are used on the view For example, a web forms user control will contain logic rptItems.DataSource  blah rptItems.DataBindp  pWith MVC, Im assuming that logic will be in the view controller and the view would access it by the ViewBag Im a little confused at how to do this.p  pSecondly, how would you handle deep routingp  pEG p  pStoreProductsCategory is fine, but what about StoreProductsCategoryDeliveryUK  Would I need to set up a route in global.asax for each route I need In web forms, I just called the ReWritePath method and handled the routing myself using regular expressions.p  pThanks for the time to read this, and hopefully answer some of my queriesp

When I loop on the list and try to call the CreateModel method, this is always the Node class method which is called therefore throwing the exception. p  pI cannot change CreateModel to abstract as the return type is different depending on the derived type. I was wondering if it is possible to have a different return type. I also want to avoid generics. The fact is that Intellisense is showing me the upper class method when playing around with an instance of it. If I remove the virtual implementation from the upper class, then it displays the base class implementation. This is where I thought it is actually possible.p  pSo how can I force the program to call the upper class methodp  hr  pstrongEDITstrong The answer was actually simple and was right under my nose. The return type does not matter as it will inherits from the return type defined in the base class abstract CreateModel. I just marked the method as abstract in my base class and it works just fine. I dont know why I got confused at some moments because now it seems pretty obvious to me. p  pThanks everybody for helping me out.p

If you are trying to rebind a project that you have already added to source control outside Microsoft Visual Studio, you should use the Change Source Control command.

So I havent even gotten to deploying to a hosting server, because it no longer runs locally.pli ol  h2An asideh2  pOn the latter point above Silverlight plugin crashing, the issue seems to be related to the strong3Dstrong Silverlight functionality, which apparently requires elevated trustpermissions  admittedly, I dont fully understand how that all works yet.p  pGenerally speaking  irrespective of all of this DLLreference fiddling  it seems like I need to check Require elevated trust when running inbrowser in the Silverlight3dApp project properties to get the spinning 3D cube app to show up in the browser. Alternatively, if I leave that unchecked, I need to manually rightclick the Silverlight 5 app in the browser and enable 3D graphics on the Permissions tab.

Negative 45217 pA PHP function I am writing pulls a small bit of HTML data from another webpage using filegetcontents, then parses out a piece of text and tries to store it in a database.  The problem is, the data it gets must be encoded with a different charset or something Im not positive how to check this because it often adds  at seemingly random places in the string, not always at beginning or end and every once in a while adds a new line where I dont want one.  The  is annoying but when the newline is added it causes the javascript function to fail.  The javascript function is printed from a php script as followsp  precodeprint ltltltEND     setUpSenda, b, c, d END codepre  pAnd when the newline is entered, the function no longer works I suppose because of the newline, and viewing the source shows something like thisp  precodeprint ltltltEND         setUpSenda information, b information , c information, d information END codepre  pI did some research and found that this  is the UTF8 BOM Byte Order Mark and it is suggested to parse the information as xml not as a string  I found that there are some php libraries to do this httpphp.netmanualenbook.xml.php but was thinking there might be an easier way, like a simple php function that will convert it automatically, or strip unwanted characters.p  pAlso, sometimes the information can contain quotes, but since that would mess up the js function as well, I tried to use PHPs addslashes function and it just doesnt add any slashes, not working at all.  If I manually write the same exact string in php however, and use addslashes on that, it adds the slashes normally, so it makes me think that somehow php cant understand the encoding of this text I am getting.  Something weird is going on but Im lost on how to fix it.p  pId be more than open to any suggestions as Ive looked up a lot of stuff but cant figure out a good way to solve this.p

The handling of variables and assignments can be embedded as special cases within the logical structure above, or it can be done in separate logic beforeafter the expression is evaluated. Your calculator class will need a field to store the value of each variable x, y, and z. In an assignment, the first operand is a variable name and the first operator is . The value of the expression to the right of  must be evaluated, and the value then can be stored in the field corresponding to the variable. If x, y, or z occurs in the expression to the right of , its current value can be found in the corresponding field. The variables can be replaced with their values in the code that gets the next operand, or the variable values can be inserted in a separate pass through the expression before it is evaluated.p  pstrongAny help, inciteful links, or suggestions would be greatstrongp  pstrongIm new on the programming scene and would like to learn.strongp

The updater appeared to work fine, but when it launches the real app, it crashes.  p  pRun on Windows 7, it crashes withp  pFaulting application name ProviderDesktop.exe, version 2.6.0.0, time stamp 0x4f4fad5e Faulting module name KERNELBASE.dll, version 6.1.7600.16850, time stamp 0x4e211485 Exception code 0xe0434352 Fault offset 0x0000b9bc Faulting process id 0x2388 Faulting application start time 0x01ccf8971407b4fe Faulting application path CProgram Files x86UHINt2.5ProviderDesktop.exe Faulting module path CWindowssyswow64KERNELBASE.dll Report Id 53717437648a11e1a4558a2e36aa00e8p  pRun on XP, it crashes withp  pEventType  clr20r3     P1  providerdesktop.exe     P2  2.6.1.1br P3  4f4fad5e     P4  providerdesktop     P5  2.6.1.1     P6  4f4fad5ebr P7  85d     P8  0     P9  system.io.fileloadexceptionp  pIve performed 2 diagnoses so far after googling the problem.  p  pFirst, I tried Fusion logging.  Nothing was found.p  pSecond, I tried DependencyWalker, loading the faulty app on the Windows 7 development machine.  It showed a missing IESHIMS.DLL.  Referring to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8003577buildingcsharpforwindows732bitplatformonwindows764bitmachinethisa post, I located IESHIMS.DLL, but noticed in DependencyWalker that it actually expected the DLL to be in the applications root folder.  I placed it there, reran DependencyWalker and that error was gone.  However, there is another error which I strongly suspect is the root cause of the problem  Error Modules with different CPU types were found.p  pEvery module listed in DependencyWalker is x64, except the ieshims.dll and my actual .exe which are x86.  Both the Updater and Real apps are targeting x86 platform.p  pSome colleagues had suggested before that I may have problems due to 3rd party references in Real app.  From what I can see here, that doesnt seem to be the case.p  pIf someone could help me get a handle on this, Id definitely appreciate it as I really dont have much knowledge of lower level concepts such as x86x64.  Itd mean the difference between getting to develop on a nice fast machine in 2010.NET 4.0 and having to keep a VM around of XP32 just for this application which has serious performance issues and developing in 2005.NET 2.0.p  pMy goal is to be able to develop the application on Win7x64, 2010, 4.0 and have the updater update clients versions of the applilcation without issues.p  pMany thanks in advance.p

Negative 45217 pI have an ASP.NET web application that presents data retrieved from a web service.p  pBefore getting actual data from the service a token must be retrieved by calling a specific method in that service. This token must then be providing in any subsequent data method calls.

The active token is kept in a global ASP.NET application variable.p  pThis is all fine, but how do I prevent overlapping token renewals A request from one user to the site triggers a service call, this gives an error and a new token is retrieved and put in the cache, but in the meantime another user request finds that the token is expired and also renews the token.p  pIs there not a problem here I cant really wrap my head around it.p

Negative 45217 pI have a form where there are preferences for a hotel customer. There are a lot of preferences, for instance, for the Drink category, there is coca, wine, whiskey. Customers can make multiple selection, for example, selecting both wine and coca for Drink. I have a table named customerpreferences to store their preferences in postgresql. The table will consist of the ID of the customer as primary key and columns like Drinks and Leisure. Now when a customer has selected coca and wine for drink, how can I store both these values Also I am planning to use the database for data mining. My question is how can I store multiple values of preferences and the corresponding insert statement Thank you.p

Negative 45217 pMy company has been using SVN, but has recently made the move to TFS 2010 for source control, continuous integration, and work item management.  Were pretty happy with TFS so far, but it seems like it is missing a couple of features we liked from TortoiseSVN.  Specifically, the TortoiseSVN RepoBrowser has the ability to select the revision to view.  That way, you can easily see what files and folders existed at the revision of your choosing.  p  pWe have not been able to find a way to do this using the Source Control explorer in VS2010.  This makes it difficult to get the history of development branches that were reintegrated into the Trunk and deleted.p  pI have looked into solutions like SVNBridge, but have yet to get it working correctly.  Are there any other solutions out there for accomplishing thisp

It seems like it should be simple enough to achieve this but Im really struggling at the minute to think how  I think its made slightly more confusing because a child may share only one parent with another child to be considered as a sibling.p  pHopefully this is clear, thanks.p  pEdit Just to make it clear, the relationship is identified by a child sharing a parent ID with another child the ids are unique, but I provided generic ones for this example.  So as Child 2, 3 and 4 all have a parent with an id of C they are considered siblings.p

The idea being most of the long hard work and saves can be done on the private MOC freeing the main thread from blocking the UI. Unfortunately I seem to be running into a couple of situations that cause deadlocks.p  pIf the child MOC on the main thread is performing a fetch with NSFetchedResultsController the parent context is sent an executeFetchRequest it can create a deadlock. Both operations are done within the context of a performBlock for their respective MOCs although the docs seem to indicate that using a main thread concurrency type MOC on the main thread without performBlock is fine.p  pIt appears that the private queue is waiting on the PSCs lock which the child context on the main thread has already locked. It appears that the child context while holding the PSCs lock is trying to dispatchsync to the parent context and thus they are both waiting for each other.p  pIs PriveQueue  MainQueue a supported configuration It seems most people still have the parent context on the main thread.p  pThe main thread looks like thisp  blockquote precodegt 0    0x960f6c5e in semaphorewaittrap  gt 1    0x04956bb5 in dispatchthreadsemaphorewait  gt 2    0x04955c8f in dispatchbarriersyncfslow  gt 3    0x04955dea in dispatchbarriersyncf  gt 4    0x01797de5 in perform  gt 5    0x01798547 in [NSManagedObjectContextNestedContextSupport newValuesForObjectWithIDwithContexterror]  gt 6    0x0176416b in PFFaultHandlerLookupRow  gt 7    0x01763f97 in [NSFaultHandler fulfillFaultwithContextforIndex]  gt 8    0x01763b75 in PFFulfillDeferredFault  gt 9    0x017639f2 in sharedIMPLpvfkcore  gt 10    0x017681a0 in pvfk11  gt 11    0x0001b322 in [FBUser sectionName] at UsersmlinkCodexxFBUser.m62 gt 12    0x011a8813 in NSGetUsingKeyValueGetter  gt 13    0x017a0652 in [NSManagedObject valueForKey]  gt 14    0x011ab8d5 in [NSObjectNSKeyValueCoding valueForKeyPath]  gt 15    0x01851f72 in [NSFetchedResultsControllerPrivateMethods sectionNameForObject]  gt 16    0x01853af6 in [NSFetchedResultsControllerPrivateMethods computeSectionInfoerror]  gt 17    0x01850ea6 in [NSFetchedResultsController performFetch]  gt 18    0x0003a4fc in 62[SYFriendsTableViewController updateFetchedResultsController]blockinvoke0  gt 19    0x01797af3 in developerSubmittedBlockToNSManagedObjectContextPerform  gt 20    0x049554f0 in dispatchmainqueuecallback4CF  gt 21    0x01b3e833 in CFRunLoopRun  gt 22    0x01b3ddb4 in CFRunLoopRunSpecific  gt 23    0x01b3dccb in CFRunLoopRunInMode  gt 24    0x023d6879 in GSEventRunModal  gt 25    0x023d693e in GSEventRun  gt 26    0x0089aa9b in UIApplicationMain  gt 27    0x00002656 in main at UsersmlinkCodexxmain.mm16 codepre blockquote  pthe private queue stack looks like thisp  precode0    0x960f8876 in psynchmutexwait  1    0x97e9e6af in pthreadmutexlock  2    0x0172ec22 in [PFLock lock]  3    0x0172ebfa in [NSPersistentStoreCoordinator lock]  4    0x01746a8c in [NSManagedObjectContextNSInternalAdditions lockObjectStore]  5    0x01745030 in [NSManagedObjectContext executeFetchRequesterror]  6    0x0009d49f in [NSManagedObjectContextAdditions executeFetchRequest] at UsersmlinkCodeobjcCCNSManagedObjectContextAdditions.m44 7    0x0002177f in [FBUser usersForFbidsinManagedObjectContext] at UsersmlinkCodexxFBUser.m435 8    0x00021fc0 in 77[FBUser updateUserFromGraphValuesinManagedObjectContextcompletionHandler]blockinvoke0 at UsersmlinkCodexxFBUser.m461 9    0x0180f9f3 in developerSubmittedBlockToNSManagedObjectContextPerformprivateasync  10    0x04954ecf in dispatchqueuedrain  11    0x04954d28 in dispatchqueueinvoke  12    0x049544af in dispatchworkerthread2  13    0x97ea1b24 in pthreadwqthread  14    0x97ea36fe in startwqthread  codepre  pstrongHe also writes thisstrongp  pIm starting to think the problem is with NSFetchedResultsController which is always stuck at performFetch when these deadlocks occur.

As a test I tried to reproduce what the FRC does and performed the executeFetchRequest and then iterated through the results asking each object for its section name. And this doesnt cause a deadlock. If I leave the FRC to do performFetch after I do my test it will still deadlock there. Im 99 sure that the FRC has a synchronization problem with nested contexts.p  pstrongQuestion Does anybody know why this problem occurs Do you know how to solve it Is this a bugstrongp

Negative 45217 pIn a hrefhttphttp.developer.nvidia.comGPUGemsgpugemsch09.html relnofollowNvidias GPU Gems Chapter 9a it says that the projection matrix for generating shadow volumes should have its far plane at infinity so that the shadow volume is not cut off.  Since the projection matrix for the shadow volumes ends at infinity, I assume that the projection matrix for every draw pass in the scene should also have its far plane at infinity.p  pDoesnt this reduce the quality of the depth testing because the same number of bits are being used over a greater depth  Do people really use a far plane at infinity, and does it work out OK  Or is there another approachp

Negative 45217 pI am currently developing a codefunctioncode in codeCcode to find the last codecharcode occurrence of a given string. I want it to use a certain method my own if the length of the string is not given, otherwise it will just use codestrrchrcode. So after a bit of researching I decided that a codemacrocode would be the way to go. This is what I havep  precode sizet strlchrconst char str, const char ch, const int strln       function code if strlen  1 no parameter     function code if strlen  1 parameter given    define strlchrarg2str, ch strlchrstr, ch, 1 define strlchrarg3str, ch, strlen strlchrstr, ch, strln define getarg4arg2, arg3, arg4... arg4 define strlchrmacro...  getarg4VAARGS, strlchrarg3,  arg2,  define strlchr... strlchrmacroVAARGSVAARGS codepre  pIs this the correct way of acheiving my goal Or are there any more efficent ways Also do I have to have the function code before the macro in the source file I normally write my functions at the bottom, and have my declarations, in this case codesizet strlchrconst char, const char, const intcode towards the top of my source file, and finally my macros and such at the top of my source file. So ideally my layout would be p  precodemacrosdefines function declaration function code codepre  pThis question is based completely off of other examples I saw from the web. Is this how one would go about using optional function parameters Or am I way off I havent implemented it yet since I would first like to get some input before doing something horribly wrong I have never made a macro before and this macro is for the most part taken from an example and I have minimal understanding of what it exactly does.p

Negative 45217 pIm new to Hadoop MapReduce 4 days to be precise and Ive been asked to perform distributed XML parsing on a cluster. As per my research on the Internet, it should be fairly easy using Mahouts XmlInputFormat, but my task is to make sure that the system works for huge 5TB XML files.p  pAs per my knowledge, the file splits sent to the mappers cannot be larger than the hdfs block size or the perjob block size. [Correct me if Im mistaken].p  pThe issue Im facing is that some XML elements are large 200MB and some are small 1MBp  pSo my question is What happens when the XML element chunk created by XmlInputFormat is bigger than the block size Will it send the entire large file say 200MB to a mapper or will it send out the element in three splits 6464648p  pI currently dont have access to the companys hadoop cluster and wont be until sometime so I cannot perform a test and find out. Kindly help me out.p

Negative 45217 pI have an application that consists of a host program and a few plugins. The plugins are implemented in dlls that can be dynamically loaded and unloaded. The code of the plugins inside the dlls allocate memory for objects and pass the pointers to the host program. These objects are allocated on the dll heap and there is no way to change the interface to use a specialized memory allocation function. p  pIs there a way for the host program to detect on which heap manager an object has been allocated I want to implement some kind of reference counting for the dll. As long as the host program still uses memory from the dll, the dll cannot be unloaded. That means I would like to track from the host program who which plugin allocated a memory block objects that are kept in various lists inside the host. The current interface includes a call to unload a dll. This call should schedule for unload, but only execute it once the host is finished using the memory. p  pThanks for any suggestions.  p

Negative 45217 pWe want to switch to .net 4.5 cause it offers many improvements.p  pBut...sometimes I found some tricky details about not trivial changes in the framework.p  pLets look for TPL unobserved a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarydd997415.aspxexception handlinga as an eamplep  blockquote   pIf you do not wait on a task that propagates an exception, or access   its Exception property, the exception is escalated according to the   .NET exception policy when the task is garbagecollected.   note, there is no link or clarification for the term exception policyp blockquote  pWell, that is seemingly the behavior as it was in .Net v.4.0brp  pBut Stephen Toub a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combpfxteamarchive2011092810217876.aspxtells us moreap  blockquote   pTo make it easier for developers to write asynchronous code based on   Tasks, .NET 4.5 changes the default exception behavior for unobserved   exceptions.  While unobserved exceptions will still cause the   UnobservedTaskException event to be raised not doing so would be a   breaking change, the process will not crash by default.  Rather, the   exception will end up getting eaten after the event is raised,   regardless of whether an event handler observes the exception.  This   behavior can be configured, though.  A new CLR configuration flag may   be used to revert back to the crashing behavior of .NET 4.br   Note that this change doesnt mean developers should be careless about   ignoring unhandled exceptions it just means the runtime is a bit more   forgiving than it used to be.p blockquote  pThat is a great surprise. Taking into account there is no update in documentation.p  pSo, Id like to know what other silent changes Id better know about happened in .Net v4.5br Please, share your knowledge.p  pP.S.

Negative 45217 p1st question here and need some guidence,p  pI have an html page that is used for workflow purposes in which users input information into textboxes to help them make decisions.  In most cases there is no need to save their work, however on certain occaisions they may need to come back to it for one reason or another.  The html page is run directly from the users hard drive and does not connect to a database or server.  p  pMy goal is to create a way for users to push a button and have all of the input data saved to a text or javascript file that they can then reload at a later time if need be.p  pIve looked around for some time, but cannot find a suitable solution, so am hoping someone here can give me guidence.  Id rather not recreate the whole thing in ExcelAccess as the page utilizes a lot of javascript for logicwarnings and Im not overly familiar with VB.p  pFor now, the save as function works so long as it is saved as a text file, but the formatting is not very user friendly, not to mention the javascript functionality is removed.p  pI should note that all users use Internet Explorer v8 and cross compatablity is of very little concern at this time.  Additionally, the choice of browser is not mine, nor do I have any influence on ifwhen an upgrade or change may happen.p  pI know these are a lot of restrictions, but Im hoping we can come up with a solution.p

Negative 45217 pI need to store a huge data in a map for Invert Index, but my data is very huge, and I see that as Map gets bigger and bigger, it becomes slower and slower.

However in this case even similar audios will return different hashes and Distinct will treat it as different objects and compare method does not fired.p  pI tried to force GetHashCode always returns 0, so Compare called for eachtoeach object in collection, but this is slow.

Negative 45217 pIm trying to fetch every record from a table in a MS SQL database with about 20 million entries via an entity data model. My initial idea was to retrieve the data in chunks, like sop  precodepublic IEnumerableltIEnumerableltdevicegtgt GetDevicesInChunksint chunkSize      using var db  new AccountsEntities              for int i  0 i lt db.devices.Count i  chunkSize                      yield return db.devices.Skipi.TakechunkSize                codepre  pHowever, it appears that I must call codeOrderBycode before I call codeSkipcode, judging by the exception that is thrown when I employ the above methodp  precodeThe method Skip is only supported for sorted input in LINQ to Entities. The method  OrderBy must be called before the method Skip. codepre  pIm sure calling codeOrderBycode on every subset of records I retrieve will be costly since the devices are in no particular order  I feel like Im walking down the wrong path here.p  pWhats the best approach to handling large SQL queries via LINQp

Negative 45217 pI am currently using this code below to dismiss a storyboard table view where users can make an in app purchase back to presenting an .xib which is the main view of my app and displays the total credits in a UILabel.

Negative 45217 pIm implementing a REST web service using C which will be hosted on Azure as a cloud service.  Since it is a REST service, it is stateless and therefore no cookies or session states.  p  pThe web service can only be accessed over HTTPS Certificate provided by StartSSL.com.p  pUpon a user successfully logging into the service they will get a security token.  This token will provide authentication in future communications.p  pThe token will contain a timestamp, userid and ip address of the client.p  pAll communication will only happen over HTTPS so Im not concerned about the token being intercepted and used in replay attacks the token will have an expiry anyway.p  pSince this is a public facing service I am however concerned that someone could register with the service, login and then modifying the token that they receive to access the accounts of other users.p  pIm wondering how best to secure the content of the token and also verify that it hasnt been tampered with.p  pI plan on doing the following to secure the tokenp  pThe client successfully logs into the service and the service does p  ol liGenerate a random value and hash it with SHA256 1000 times.li liGenerate a onetime session key from private key  hashed random value.li liHash the session key with SHA256 1000 times and then use it to encrypt the tokenli liUse private key to sign the encrypted token using RSA.li liSends the encrypted token  the signature  the hashed random value to the client in an unencrypted JSON package.li ol  pWhen the client calls a service it sends the encrypted token and signature in an unencrypted JSON package to the service.

Negative 45217 pDespite the fact that I know almost nothing about LDAP and AD apart from the basics of what it does in this case, Microsoft I have been asked to modify a program so that it will retrieve the users email address.  The application can be configured to use LDAP.  Im not sure exactly how it is using it  something to do with synchronising the applications passwords with the users LDAP password.  The application has a password, which might not be the same as the users LDAP password.  There is some mechanism to synchronise the passwords  but in theory that shouldnt concern me  Im told that it works.p  pOf course, we didnt have an LDAP server here for me to try things out on.p  pSo I have installed Windows 2003 server on a PC, and enabled LDAP on it a massive learning curve, I can tell you.  I have added a couple of users. and even managed to get one of them to be a member of Domain Admin.p  pIn the application Im working on, there is a setup facility to configure the connection to the LDAP.  This has a helpful Test Settings button.  If I put in the server IP address and the port number, and press Test Settings then it tells me that the test was successful.  Hmm  that seems unlikely.  There are other pieces of information it asks forp  ul liService Account DNli liService Account Passwordli liUser Account Container.li ul  pIf I leave those blank, and save the settings then I am now able to start up the application and put only the username in with any or no password  which is not right, of course  it should prevent me from starting up my app.  So I can only assume that I need to set up those three pieces of info.p  pThe LDAP server I created is called, I believe, codeAware.Servercodep  pSo I have put codeDCAWare, DCServercode into the Service account DN Im just guessing here, not really sure what should be in there and codecnUsers, DCAWare.Servercode into the User Account Container again, I dont really know what that is, or what is meant to be in there.p  pI have no idea what the Service Account Password is, so I leave that blank.p  pWhen I press Test Settings it asks me for a user name and password.p  pIf I leave those blank then it says that the test was successful.  Im beginning to worry.p  pIf I put in a user name that I have entered into LDAP, with a password, it says that the test was successful.p  pActually, if I put anything at all into those boxes, it says that it is successful.p  pHowever, if I put something into the Service Account Password then the test is not successful  it says that the service account supplied has either an invalid user name or password.p  pSo the main question at this point is  how do I find out what the service account password isp  pAnd is the behaviour that Im getting to be expected Thanks Stevep  pCode for validating sign on includesp  precodePublic Shared Function ValidateUserByVal server As String, ByVal port As Integer, ByVal userBase As String, ByVal userName As String, ByVal password As String, ByVal bindUser As String, ByVal bindPassword As String As LdapValidatorResult             Dim retVal As New LdapValidatorResult             Dim conn As New Novell.Directory.Ldap.LdapConnection             Try                  connect to the specificed server for user validation                 conn.Connectserver, port                  retVal.Result  LdapValidatorResultType.Success                 Try                     now authenticate to we can then go on to see if the username specificed exists                     conn.BindbindUser, bindPassword                      construct the distinguished name to uniquely id the specified user                     Dim searchString As String  String.FormatCN0,1, userName, userBase                      look to see if the user attempting to login to aware exists                     Dim sResults As LdapSearchResults  conn.SearchsearchString, Novell.Directory.Ldap.LdapConnection.SCOPESUB, Nothing, Nothing, False ampobjectClasscomputer                     If sResults.hasMore Then                          Try                              now validate the user with the password as the final check                             Dim userDN As String  sResults.next.DN                             conn.BinduserDN, password                             retVal.Result  LdapValidatorResultType.Success                          Catch ex As Novell.Directory.Ldap.LdapException                             If ex.ResultCode  Novell.Directory.Ldap.LdapException.INVALIDCREDENTIALS Then                                 retVal.Result  LdapValidatorResultType.InvalidUserNameOrPassword                             End If                             retVal.ExceptInfo  ex                         End Try                      Else                         retVal.Result  LdapValidatorResultType.NonExistentUser                       End If                 Catch ex As Novell.Directory.Ldap.LdapException                     Select Case ex.ResultCode                         Case Novell.Directory.Ldap.LdapException.INVALIDCREDENTIALS                             retVal.Result  LdapValidatorResultType.InvalidBindUserNameOrPassword                         Case Novell.Directory.Ldap.LdapException.CONNECTERROR                             retVal.Result  LdapValidatorResultType.ServerDown                     End Select                      retVal.ExceptInfo  ex                 End Try              Catch ex As Novell.Directory.Ldap.LdapException                 Dim cause As System.Net.Sockets.SocketException  TryCastex.Cause, System.Net.Sockets.SocketException                 If cause IsNot Nothing Then                     Select Case cause.ErrorCode                         Case 1101                             retVal.Result  LdapValidatorResultType.InvalidNameIp                         Case 1106                             retVal.Result  LdapValidatorResultType.RefusedConnectionOnPort                         Case 10060                             retVal.Result  LdapValidatorResultType.ServerDown                     End Select                 End If                 retVal.ExceptInfo  ex             End Try              Return retVal         End Function codepre

Negative 45217 pI am running ClojureEclipseCounterclockwise. When I insert a breakpoint in core.clj there is only one line in which the dot acquires a small tail. That is line 29. This is independent of what code is on line 29.

Also, the focus moves to the tab for file clojure.core. Line 29 on that file is the one starting with cons below. It is the last line in the definition of cons. It is also the first line in clojure.core where . clojure.lang.RT appears there are other similar lines below.

Negative 45217 pIm new to JQuery animation, this seems like a relatively simple question but Ive done some digging and cant find any solutions elsewhere.p  pI have a parent div that I want to set to a certain percentage height, e.g.p  precodeparent.animate     height 75  codepre  pThere is a child div that I want to be 100 of the height of the parent. p  pWhat is the best way for me to animate the two together simultaneously, so that whatever height I decide to animate the parent to, 50, 30, 22.937, the child remains at 100 of the parent height but growsshrinks alongside the parent p  pHere is a fiddle a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netazw2F2 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netazw2F2ap  pI guess I could scrap the percentages, figure out what the heights would be in pixels from the container height, and then animate the parent and child to the same pixel value, but is there an easier wayp  pThank you, Adamp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pThe issue seems to be related to whether the child div is positioned within the dimensions of the parent. Any parts of the child div that are outside of the dimensions are not animated, they just pop in at the end once the animation is finished.p  pChild within parent a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netazw2F9 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netazw2F9a Child partially outside parent a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netazw2F10 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netazw2F10ap  pI guess the HTML should probably be restructured so the parent is a sibling instead, and that might be the only answer other than what I said about calculating the pixels. I guess I was just hoping that there was some JQuery animate magic I was unaware of.p

Then, when the keyboard is hidden, the ListView is shown again.p  pWhat I have so far which is currently working, but a terrible ugly hack.  Is that I implement the method shown here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2150078howtocheckvisibilityofsoftwarekeyboardinandroidHow to check visibility of software keyboard in Androida to detect when the keyboard is shown and the remaining size of the viewable area.  Then, I calculate the size of all of the fixedsized elements which are above the keyboard ActionBar, TextView, and a random ImageView.  I then subtract that from the total area available to me, and I set my EditText to be the size of what is left over.  p  pThis way, since the EditText is laid out directly above the TextView, it will push the TextView to be the exact right height above the keyboard and leave enough room for everything.p  pNow, this obviously makes me tremendously uncomfortable, because Im bound to run into a user with a tiny screen that somehow breaks this ugly hack however, I havent been up with a better way to solve this problem.  Does anyone have any suggestions for how to do sop  pThe other solution which I tried is setting the Activity to adjustResize when the soft keyboard is shown and then hiding my ListView.  However, because of delays in the timing of when the keyboard is shownnot shown this just ends up looking terribly glitchy.p  pEdit Ive added a pixelaccurate representation of what Im looking for.img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comuD8Zf.png altAndroid layoutp

Negative 45217 pI found this a hrefhttpkaibun.netblog20130419afullyfledgedcoffeescriptboilerplateforjqueryplugins relnofollowCoffeeScript boilerplate for jQuery pluginsa which I have been studying and em[trying to]em use in a plugin that Im em[trying to]em write. I have referenced the same boilerplatetemplate in a few other questions. I am an amateur at JavaScript and a complete newcomer to CoffeeScript. Im trying to study and learn, but when something bothers me and I cant find a satisfactory answer through Google, I come here... So forgive my lack of knowledge and potential mistakes in any code that I write and present here.p  pThe CoffeeScript code compiles to thisp  precodefunction      function, window, document          var this, methods, anotherState, flag, internals, settings         this  void 0         settings               default cool                  flag  false         anotherState  null         methods               init functionoptions                  this  this                 .extendsettings, options                   return this             ,             doSomething functionwhat                  return this             ,             destroy function                  return this                               internals               toggleFlag function                  return flag  flag             ,             computeSomething functionstate, flag                  return flag  null  flag                       state No, thats not right.                                                return .fn.foobar  functionmethod              if methods[method]                  return methods[method].applythis, Array.prototype.slice.callarguments, 1              else if typeof method  object  method                  return methods.init.applythis, arguments              else                  return .errorMethod   method   does not exist on jquery.foobar                           jQuery, window, document  .callthis codepre  pFrom a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions18106686coffeescriptandjquerypluginauthoringherea and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions18148261jquerypluginauthoringincoffeescriptwithconventionallyprivateobjectsaherea I understand that the codefunction....callthiscode wrapper, is a CoffeeScript feature and is meant to localize variables that are not explicitly declared to be global. emI later learnt that it can be suppressed during compilation tooem. I also learned that I did not need to include codewindowcode and codedocumentcode as arguments to the jQuery closure.p  pAs I studied it more and tried to edit it, I saw that in the compiled code, the closure which is a function returns code.fn.foobarcode right where it defines it. Since that function is anonymous and isnt gonna be called anyway, I suppose the returned value doesnt matter. But still, what if I put a codereturncode statement in the CoffeeScript code like thisp  precode.fn.foobar  method gt   if methods[method]     methods[method].apply this, Arrayslice.callarguments, 1   else if typeof method is object or not method     methods.init.apply this, arguments   else     .error Method   method   does not exist on jquery.foobar   This, right here... return   codepre  pIt no longer compiles to codereturn .fn.foobar  ...code but instead just code.fn.foobar  ...code. I think that doesnt make any difference, rather it makes the JS output more... emcleanem... if you will. But I need to confirm that. How does that effect the execution of the scriptp  pMoreover, in the CoffeeScript code, the author says that inside codemethods.initcode I need to perform all operations on codethis.eachcode but instead, if I dop  precode  init options gt     .extend settings, options or      return .each  gt  I dont really need return, do I        In here  is one element out of the array of elements       return  This is to suppress any returns inside .each codepre  pSo this is it... Here are my strongquestionsstrongp  ol liIs there a reason not to codereturncode from the anonymous function in the CoffeeScript code How exactly does that differ from the original CoffeeScript codeli liWhat would be a proper way to iterate over all items in the jQuery array on which the plugin is called, while maintaining chainability.li ol  hr  pstrongNOTEstrong I did not include the CoffeeScript code to avoid the post getting too long. But I have provided a link to the page where the code is listed. However, if its a trouble, do let me know in comments and I shall edit the post to contain the CoffeeScipt code, too. Thank you for your time.p

Negative 45217 pI am trying to create an iOS app that gets some data from a web service and displays it in customized cells. So far i could verify via NSLog cmd that the data actually is in the corresponding array. This means the Connection delegates getting called. But unfortunately not the TableView delegates. Or lets say they are getting called but maybe at the wrong place i also tried to reload the Table view after the connectionDidFinishLoading method but it does not work too. Any idea what is wrongp  pIt is also very interesting that the first time my NSLog is getting called i have 0 objects in the array and the second time after the connection has been made i have 25 objects.

Negative 45217 pI came across this very peculiar problem where I am unable to modify the frame of a UIImageView. p  pI have isolated it to this very simple example. Starting from a default single view application xcode template, I add a UIImageView in Interface Builder, link it to the ViewController property called testImage, and in ViewController.m I addp  precodevoidviewDidAppearBOOLanimated     UIImageView maskImage  [[UIImageView alloc] initWithFrameself.testImage.frame]     maskImage.image  self.testImage.image     maskImage.alpha  0     [self.view addSubviewmaskImage]     self.testImage.frame  CGRectMake10, 10, 10, 10  codepre  pand it does not work. The test image remains resolutely where it was. If I do not add maskImage to view, the example works. And, yes I am sure I am not covering the destination with maskImage.p  pIf I do not use the IB to place the image, but instead usep  precodeself.testImage  [[UIImageView alloc] initWithFrameCGRectMake0, 100, 300, 300] self.testImage.image  [UIImage imageNamedjim105.png] [self.view addSubviewself.testImage] codepre  pin viewDidLoad it all works as expected. p  pI have also tried to just place the image in IB, then set its properties in viewDidLoad, but with the same effect. I have been trying this in Xcode5. I do not have access to previous Xcode here, and I am not sure is this an expected behaviour and if so why or is this a bugp

Every Order has a product plus quantity in a foreign key relationship and the product belongs to a category with a foreign key.p  pSo Order has an OrderId, ProductId FK to Product, a data plus a quantity and Product has a ProductId, Name, and a CategoryId FK to Category and Category has a CategoryId and a Name.p  pNow we want to make a shopping list which displays the categories that are ordered during the day and display the products below the category name.p  pThe query below based on this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1300088distinctwithlambdaquestiona does just that except for checking the datep  precodepublic ActionResult Index              var orders  db.Orders.Includeo gt o.Product             .Includeo gt o.Product.Category             .GroupByo gt o.Product.Category.Name             .Selectcat gt cat.FirstOrDefault          return Vieworders.ToList       codepre  pIn our view I can display the different categories by doingp  precodeforeach var cat in Model     lttablegt        lttrgt            lttdgt                 Html.DisplayForcatNamegt cat.Product.Category.Name            lttdgt         lttrgt    lttablegt  codepre  pThe next step is to display the different ordered products and quantities below this in the forloop.

Negative 45217 pIm writing an application with kinect sdk 1.8, i have implemented a kinect scrollviewer and a custom HoverButton that launch a loader each time the hand pointer is over a button with the property IsInGripInteractionfalse. All works until i try this behaviour Made a Grip to scroll the kinectScrollviewer Content, with grip interaction still in function the hand pointer image , azure and close... i bring my hand out the screen. After doing this i reenter in the screen with my hand closed but the HandPointer is open the default open hand image. At this point the handpointer seems to be in IsInGripInteractionTrue but with the default open image, my loader not recognize the hand over any button... To make things works again i have to close and open my hand. Theres any solution I can block the kinect hand pointer before it exit from the screen Or i can force the update of the Grip state of the HandPointerp  pEDITp  pI found the real cause, what loose reactivity is the method GetIsOver of kinectregion.handpointers[indexofactualhand].GetIsOverUIElement. Sometimes when my hand scroll over the screen the method return always false until i close and open my hand again.Thers a way to refresh runtime the handPointerp

Negative 45217 pIm a CC programmer and new to javascript. The following code is giving me grief and I dont really know what Im doing wrong. Ive searched and cant find where others have had the same problem.p  pIve taken my project and cut out my problem code to try and understand and fix it. The short version is when I click my Enter data image on an HTML page, it creates a dialog box with a form and table of inputs with default data and I enterchange some data. When I click the dialog box save button, it goes through JSON.stringifyform.jsonify to collect the form data and brings up an alert box showing the data that I entered. This part works fine.p  pIf I click the Enter data image again, the dialog box comes up and I enterchange new data. When I click the dialog box save button, it brings up an alert box showing the previous data that I saved in this case showed in the alert box.p  pNo matter how many times I try it, it always returns the data form the very first entry and never any of the newer data.p  pWhat am I doing wrongp  pSome referencesp  precodeltscript typetextjavascript srchttpajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjquery1.10.2jquery.min.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript typetextjavascript srchttpajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjqueryui1.10.3jqueryui.min.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript typetextjavascript srcScriptstest.jsgtltscriptgt  ltlink hrefContentjquerythemesuilightnessjqueryui.min.css relstylesheet gt codepre  pMy HTML codep  precodeltdivgt ltimg idadditem         TitleAdd Item         onclickaddstuffthis         OnMouseOverthis.style.cursorpointer         OnMouseOutthis.style.cursordefault         srcimagesSignAddIcon32.png gt ltdivgt codepre  pMy test.js file.p  precode.fn.jsonify  function options      var settings  .extend         stringify false     , options     var json       .eachthis.serializeArray, function           if json[this.name]              if json[this.name].push                 json[this.name]  [json[this.name]]             json[this.name].pushthis.value            else             json[this.name]  this.value            if settings.stringify         return JSON.stringifyjson     else         return json   function addstuffobj      var strHtml       var strHtml  ltdiv classcontainer idaddphonedlg titleAdd Phone overflowautogt                       ltpgtPlease enter the following information.ltpgt                       ltform idformgtlttable cellpadding0 cellspacing0 border0gt                        lttrgtlttd alignrightgtltlabel fornamegt  Data 1  ltlabelgtlttdgt                       lttdgtltinput typetext name  data1   styleborder0 colorf6931f fontweightbold alignright VALUE  Data 1 data   gt  lttdgtlttrgt                       lttrgtlttd alignrightgtltlabel fornamegt  Data 2  ltlabelgtlttdgt                       lttdgtltinput typetext name  data2   styleborder0 colorf6931f fontweightbold alignright VALUE  Data 2 data   gt  lttdgtlttrgt                       lttrgtlttd alignrightgtltlabel fornamegt  Data 3  ltlabelgtlttdgt                       lttdgtltinput typetext name  data3   styleborder0 colorf6931f fontweightbold alignright VALUE  Data 3 data   gt  lttdgtlttrgt                        lttablegtltformgt                       ltdivgt      strHtml.dialog         autoOpen false,         width 400,         modal true,         buttons              Save function                   alertAdd information   JSON.stringifyform.jsonify                 this.dialogclose             ,             Cancel function                   this.dialogclose                      ,         open function               this.siblings.uidialogbuttonpane.findbuttoncontainsCancel.focus              .dialogopen  codepre

I see two patterns p  precodeclass Post extends Eloquent       protected guarded  array      public static rules  array   codepre  pThis is my Post Model. I could run codePostallcode to get all the posts from my blog.

If I want to print it another time, I need to press it again.p  pIf I use the while keyword instead,p  precodewhile keys[KDOWN]     print DOWN codepre  pI get an infinite loop for some obscure reason.p  pThis logical alternative is also uselessp  precodeif e.type  KEYDOWN and keys[KDOWN]     print DOWN codepre  pAnd there is this other one that somehow cleans the events and you can use whilep  precodewhile not done     for e in event.get         if e.type  KEYDOWN             keys  key.getpressed             if e.type  QUIT or keys[KESCAPE]                 done  True             while keys[KDOWN]                 print DOWN                 event.get                 keys  key.getpressed codepre  pBut you press the down key for less than one second and it prints thousands of times. Moving a player would be impossible, and adjusting clock for this does not seem to be the right way to deal with it And Ive tried and Ive failed miserably..p  pTo press and execute the block thousands of times is useless. What I want, is to press the key and keep going with the action while I dont release it, within the defined game clock speed.p
Negative 45217 pI have a test class that extends codeServiceTestCaseltNotificationListenergtcode that has the following methodp  precode  public void testNotificationIntercepted throws Exception      bindServicenew IntentgetContext, NotificationInterceptor.class       Our service is already started.

The problem is that this method is never invoked.p  pMy suspicion is that the test app doesnt have the proper permissions, as its not a separate project Im using AndroidStudio, and thus doesnt have its own AndroidManifest.xml file. The app itself does have permission, both in the AndroidManifest.xml file, and in the SecurityNotifications section of the Settings menu. p  pIs there a way around this that I can use to test the functionality of my service It seems to work ok within the context of the actual app... I just would like to write a test to make sure it doesnt break, as I am likely going to refactor a few things in the future.p

Negative 45217 pSo this is the functionality I need to clean upp  pI need to create a function where viewers can click on any word in a sentence, and it will be highlighted.

Negative 45217 pImagine I am implementing Dijkstras algorithm at a park. There are points and connections between those points these specify valid paths the user can walk on e.g. sidewalks.p  pNow imagine that the user is on the grass i.e. not on a path and wants to navigate to another location. The problem is not in Dijkstras algorithm which works fine, the problem is determining at which vertex to begin.p  pHere is a picture of the problem ignore the dotted lines for nowp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com2OPit.png altenter image description herep  pstrongBlack linesstrong show the edges in Dijkstras algorithm likewise, strongpurple circlesstrong show the vertices. Sidewalks are in stronggraystrong. The grass is, you guessed it, stronggreenstrong. The user is located at the strongred starstrong, and wants to get to the strongorange Xstrong.p  pIf I naively look for the nearest vertex and use that as my starting point, the user is often directed to a suboptimal path, that involves walking further away from their destination at the start i.e. the strongred solid pathstrong.p  pThe strongblue solid pathstrong is the optimal path that my algorithm would ideally come up with.p  pNotesp  ul liAssume no paths cross over other paths.li liWhen navigating to a starting point, the user should never cross over a path e.g. sidewalk.li liIn the image above, the first line segment coming out of the star is created dynamically, simply to assist the user. The star is not a vertex in the graph since the user can be anywhere inside the grass region. The line segment from the star to a vertex is simply being displayed so that the user knows how to get to the first valid vertex in the graph.li ul  pHow can I implement this efficiently and correctlyp  hr  pstrongIdea 1 Find the enclosing polygonstrongp  pIf I find the smallest polygon which surrounds my starting point, I can now create new paths for Dijkstras algorithm from the starting point which will be added as a new vertex temporarily to each of the vertices that make up the polygon. In the example above, the polygon has 6 sides, so this would mean creating 6 new paths to each of its vertices i.e. the strongblue dotted linesstrong. I would then be able to run Dijkstras algorithm and it would easily determine that the blue solid line is the optimal path.p  pThe problem with this method is in determining which vertices comprise the smallest polygon that surrounds my point. I cannot create new paths to each vertex in the graph, otherwise I will end up with the strongred dotted linesstrong as well, which completely defeats the purpose of using Dijkstras algorithm I should not be allowed to cross over a sidewalk. Therefore, I must take care to only create paths to the vertices of the enclosing polygon. Is there an algorithm for thisp  pThere is another complication with this solution imagine the user now starts at the strongpurple lightning boltstrong. It has no enclosing polygon, yet the algorithm should still work by connecting it to the 3 points at the top right. Again, once it is connected to those, running Dijkstras is easy.br strongUpdatestrong the reason we want to connect to one of these 3 points and not walk around everything to reach the orange X directly is because we want to minimize the walking done on unpaved paths. Note This is only a constraint if you start outside a polygon. We dont care how long you walk on the grass if it is within a polygon.p  pIf this is the correct solution, then please post its algorithm as an answer.p  pOtherwise, please post a better solution.p

Negative 45217 pWe are developing a Python server on Google App Engine that should be capable of handling incoming codeHTTP POSTcode requests around 1,000 to 3,000 per minute in total. Each of the requests will trigger some datastore writing operations. In addition we will write a webclient as a humanusable interface for displaying and analyse stored data.p  pFirst we are trying to estimate usage for GAE to have at least an approximation about the costs we would have to cover in future based on the number of requests. As for datastore write operations and data storage size it is fairly easy to come up with an approximate number, though it is not so obvious for the frontend and backend instance hours. p  pAs far as I understood each time a request is coming in, an instance is being started which then is running for 15 minutes. If a request is coming in within these 15 minutes, the same instance would have been used. And now it is getting a bit tricky I think if two requests are coming in at the very same time which is not so odd with 3,000 requests per minute, is Google firing up another instance, hence Google would count an addition of at least 0.15 instance hours Also I am not quite sure how a webclient that is constantly performing read operations on the datastore in order to display and analyse data would increase the instance hours. p  pDoes anyone know a reliable way of counting instance hours and creating meaningful estimations We would use that information to know how expensive it would be to run an application on GAE in comparison to just ordering a web server.p

Another part of the project has a button that when clicked shows a slide show of the imageshtml described above using Fancybox 2.p  pThe IScroll works fine when just showing the imagehtml.  However, when I try to show the same imagehtml in Fancybox  using a different IScroll instance and code source  the scrollbar and scrolling are lost.p  pIn searching for solutions, I found a post that suggested IScroll needed to be refreshed after Fancybox dislays.

So the suggested fix was the followingp  precodeaboutbutton.fancybox     onComplete function           myiscroll.refresh       codepre  pThe onComplete function has been replaced in the newer version of IScroll 5 with afterLoad.

But when I try to parse the dates in a loop, it breaks. How could this be so p  pThe reason why I am using a loop instead of codesapplycode is because that was returning an even stranger result.

As you can see, since my format was correct, it was able to parse out the dates. But for some reason, it is also giving a time value of NA or at least that is what I think the NA means. Maybe this is happening because some of my date strings have times, while others dont. But the thing is I left the time out of the format because I dont care about time. p  pDoes anyone know why this is happening or how to fix it I cant find anywhere online where you can set the time value of a date object easily  I just cant seem to get rid of that NA. And somehow even a for loop doesnt work Either was, the output is strange and I am not getting the expected results, even though my format is correct. Very frustrating that a simple thing like parsing a vector of dates is so much more difficult than in matlab or java.p  pAny help pleasep  pEDIT when I try simplyp  precodedDates  as.Datedates,formatmdY codepre  pI get the outputp  precodedDates[110] [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA codepre  pstill those mysterious NAs.

Negative 45217 pIm trying to write a simple script to conjugate verbs in a list of words. I have a list of lists of lists like this onep  precodeexpressions  [[[battre, verb, inf, True],  [froid, adj, ms, False]], [[prendre, verb, inf, True], [froid, adj, ms, False]]] codepre  pTrue means its variable, and False means it shoudnt change. For each elem in each list of this list, i find the ones with the tag verb, and build a matching flexions list. For example, for the expression battre froid, Ill take battre, and build a list with all French flexions of the verb. Ill end up with something like p  precodeverbs  [bat, bats, battons..]. codepre  pWhat I wanna do next is, for one given expression such as battre froid, build a list of all possible flexions of this expression, such as bats froid, battons froid, etc. I should then end up with something like p  precoderes  [[[battons, verb, 3pPres], [froid, adj, ms]], [bats, v, 2sPres],[froid, adj, ms]]] codepre  pSee, my problem is not about the building itself, its about the result changing depending on where I call it from. And I cant seem to be able to identify why it behaves differently.p  pAll I do next is thisp  precodeidx  0 position in the list of the verb in one expression, here 0 for i in rangelenverbs     expressions[i][idx]  verbs[i]   replacing infinitive form by conjugated one  return res codepre  pAnd for some obscure reason, this is what happens All verbs are replaced with the last flexion found in the verbs list. BUT, that is, ONLY when this bit of code is called from within a function. When printing during execution, I see exactly what I want. But at the end, I get something different. Bigger problem is, I checked loops, I checked the data right BEFORE and during the exec of these lines of code in the function, its all good. I even copypasted the data in the function from my terminal after printing it and redid the same bit of code the for i in range part at the end of my script out of a function, and I got exactly what I wanted. p  pIt only seems to fail when done from within a function. Ive been stuck on this for two days, comparing lists, copypasting, moving code around, checking types, repr, prints... I just dont get why its behaving this way inside a function. And I need it in this function unfortunately...p  pHeres the code, where exprlistFormat is the same as expressions, and flexDict is a flexions dictionary key is a base and values are flexions of the basep  pEDIT ON ORIGINAL CODEp  precodedef createVariantsexprlistFormat, flexDict     for sublist in exprlistFormat         if sublist[3] and sublist[1]  v             verbFlex  []   list of flexions, each flexion being a tuple like bats, v, 2s             resList  []   list of copies of the expression         for flexion in flexDict[sublist[0]]             resList.appendexprlistFormat   making a copy of the original for each flexion             verbFlex.appendflexion   list of flexions         for i in rangelenverbFlex             resList[i][idx]  verbFlex[i]     return resList codepre  pDoes anyone have any idea why this isnt working or more precisely, why its only working outside of a function, and until the last for loop inside the function p  pWhen I print resList and verbFlex before the last for loop, copypaste them, and redo the range bit outside, it works just fine... I dont get it p  pThanks so much, and sorry for the long post, I was tring to be as precise and clear as I could p  pCheersp  pXhattamp

Negative 45217 pMaybe someone can Help me find the right technique.p  pI have a number of Crystal Reports that I am updating Crystal Reports XI. These reports each have an SQL Function associated with each that either retrieves records from the database if any meet criteria or returns an Empty Dataset which happens daily. These are executed in a batch process and directs the output to a PDF file which is emailed to users.p  pI am relatively new to Crystal Reports.p  pI am attempting to use a common SubReport to formatgather data for the HeadersFooters used in these documents.  So far  most of this is working as I would expect.  This allows me to use a single SubReport to generate the same HeaderFooter in multiple reports at least thats my goal.p  pHowever  I added a strongReport Footerstrong section to the Main Report  my plan with this was to generate a Report Footer that would contain the following informationp  ol liA static Text Message that reads   END OF DOCUMENT li liThe Report Title of the Main Report  li liThe Date and Time that the Document was generated and Total Number of pages.li ol  pSounds pretty simple.p  pSo SubReport is named ENDOFDOCUMENTSUBREPORTp  pI used the Special Fields   strongData Datestrong, strongData Timestrong, amp strongPage N of Mstrongp  pSince the Special Field strongReport Titlestrong is returning me the ENDOFDOCUMENTSUBREPORT value I used a Parameter field to pass the strongReport Titlestrong value from the Main Report to the SubReport.p  pThis all works fine  HOWEVER  with the addition of the Linked Parameter Field from the Main to the SubReport  when I execute the report to generate the document  the SubReport ends up showing a blank Report Footer  that I can click on to reveal the ENDOFDOCUMENTSUBREPORT in another Tab. Without the Parameter field  it didnt do this and the information from the SubReport appeared on the last page of the document.    p  pIs this a standard behavior of Crystalbr Im not sure how to Suppress the Drill Down feature and still display the Report Section.p

It basically tells me the application may be doing too much work on its main thread. Hence, I was trying to formulate an asynchronous task for my class responsible for SSLSockets etc.p  pMy interface is like when users hit Login button, they should be able to see their emails under the login button. After that, Im getting that error in the title. I think I should be able to do something else wrapping around my Login function, but I couldnt find it. There might be some other errors in my code. Please dont worry about it. I just want to fix that asynchronous issue right nowp  pId like you to call your attention to the login function a bit below.

Negative 45217 pTo effectively find n nearest neighbors of a point in ddimensional space, I selected the dimension with greatest scatter i.e. in this coordinate differences between points are largest. The whole range from minimal to maximal value in this dimension was split into k bins. Each bin contains points which coordinates in this dimensions are within the range of that bin. It was ensured that there are at least 2n points in each bin. The algorithm for finding n nearest neighbors of point x is followingp  ol liIdentify bin kx,in which point x liesits projection to be precise.li liCompute distances between x and all the points in bin kx.li liSort computed distances in ascending order.li liSelect first n distances. Points to which these distances were measured are returned as n nearest neighbors of x.li ol  pThis algorithm is not working for all cases. When algorithm can fail to compute nearest neighbors Can anyone propose modification of the algorithm to ensure proper operation for all casesp

Negative 45217 pIve been trying to refine an answer for a question here on SO but Ive come across a wierd issue and I am hoping someone could help me understand the cause. What I am attempting to do is disable the use of AJAX operations from within a protected function by overriding them with locallyscoped variables. This needs to work with libraries such as jQuery, so I tried implementing logic to recreate the  variable but for some reason I cant override the global scope with a local version like I can with the others, and meanwhile is producing some very unexpected and interesting behaviour.p  pThis is the code that Im usingp  precodevar testFunction  function      Global to locallexical     var XMLHttpRequest  undefined     var eval  undefined     var setTimeout  undefined     var setInterval  undefined     var Function  undefined     var window  undefined      Cant set directly to var      var new  functionold ifold          var newjq  functions, c               Reroute main function             return olds, c                      var jQueryBlacklist                Initialize blacklist             ajax true,             post true,             get true,             getJSON true,             getScript true                      fori in old  Reconstruct Object          ifold.hasOwnPropertyi          ampamp jQueryBlacklist[i]           newjq[i]  old[i]         return newjq                Line below completely breaks script     var   new     ifnew alertnew is undefined      Real testFunction below     return function           AJAXforbidden code         if alert is undefined         else alertjQuery is working          alert.ajax          .ajax should be undefined               testFunction  alert.ajax  should be defined codepre  pYou can click a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netzhxq9goa1 relnofollowherea to see the fiddle.p  pIm simply interested in any feedback about this, as to me it seems like a bug.

Negative 45217 pIm making a live wallpaper for android, I will explain how it works as I believe its related to the problem, Im sorry for the long question but I need to explain everything because the problem is hard to describe. p  pIm using OpenGLES 2.0, I have a GLSurfaceView and a wallpaper service implementation, I pass it my renderer to call the drawing methods, like most OpenGL live wallpapers.p  pThe way Ive implemented my renderer is in the wallpaper service I have an independent thread that will call the draw method every X seconds, the GLSurfaceView is set to RENDERMODEWHENDIRTY, so this update thread is what decides when drawing occurs.p  pFurthermore in the service there is a pause and resume method, when the visibility changes. So even if I exit the wallpaper the service will run, conserving the state of everything until its resumed.p  pNow for the problem, Ive gotten transparency working as you can see here img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com3qAfd.png altfirst time renderingp  pBut when I lose focus and regain to the wallpaper, I press the back button on androids wallpaper selector, or change the wallpaper and then come back to it.

Negative 45217 pI use DCEVM to reload classes in my Scala application. Sbt has a nice feature that it can autocompile classes when their source code changes. So what I do is I open up two sbt instances and I run codecompilecopyresourcescode in the first instance to autocompile, and coderuncode in the second instance.p  pTo debug, I can use the remote debugger tool in IntelliJ that works pretty well except for one but important thing whenever sbt reloads a class, IntelliJ no longer stops at break points. I have to restart the remote debugger in order to fix this, which is very inconvenient.p  pI do not really like the builtin compiler as it is really slow compared to sbt and also not automatic, however, if I run the program from IntelliJ and execute the codeCompile filecode command, the debugging works well.p  pHow could I improve the development process either by having sbt and IntelliJ refresh the break points on class reload or by using another setup Thank you in advance.p

Functions declared inside a class are publics.p  pAt runtime instance variables can be stored in an array, so in this example bar will be stored at index 0 of that array and the compiler will be responsible to generate correct LOAD 0 instruction in its getter function.p  pWhat about the other functions Using an array to store functions will certainly result in faster runtime access than using an hash table but I wondering what could be the drawbacks. I mean what if I would like to support the ability to add functions to a class at runtime What about overridingp  pWhat are the advantages of using an hash table to store methods instead of a regular arrayp

Negative 45217 pI have a MySQL database table which has over 35 million rows. I originally created an id field as the primary key. But this id field was just an codeautoincrementcode value which was not part of my data. But my main queries would be on a field called zipcode.p  pQueries made with codeWHERE zipcodecode seem to be very slow. I realised that indexing the zipcode field speeds this up. However, I have then noticed that each field that is indexed takes up certain amount of space. The indexing the zipcode fieled only takes up 75MB but the id field primary key index takes up over 3GB.p  pAs I do not use the id field for anything, I have now removed the id field and just keeping the index on the zipcode field. I just felt that the id field was taking up space for no reason. Is there any disadvantages of not having a unique id fieldp  pAny other ways I can speed up queries to this database tablep

Negative 45217 pI am trying to create an application that convert word tables to html as I have many, many, many documents to process.

The site that I am using is a hrefhttpword2cleanhtml.com relnofollowword2cleanhtmla. There is no API, so I thought I could paste the object from the clipboard into the page.  I can get the form that I need to paste the text into fine, but the only methods for the form that are close to what I need are TypeText which takes a string. Im not quite sure on how the page pastes the table in, but my assumption is that it is pasted via being an object. Thanksp

Negative 45217 pI use IPython Notebooks extensively in my research. I find them to be a wonderful tool.p  pHowever, on more than one occasion, I have been bitten by subtle bugs stemming from variable scope. For example, I will be doing some exploratory analysisp  precodefoo  1 bar  2 foo  bar codepre  pAnd I decide that codefoo  barcode is a useful algorithm for my purposes, so I encapsulate it in a function to make it easier to apply to a wider range of inputsp  precodedef thefunctionfoo, bar     return foo  bar codepre  pInevitably, somewhere down the line, after building a workflow from the ground up, I will have a typo somewhere e.g. codedef thefunctionfooo, barcode that causes a global variable to be used andor modified in a function call. This causes unseen side effects and leads to spurious results. But because it typically returns a result, it can be difficult to find where the problem actually occurs. p  pNow, I recognize that this behavior is a feature, which I deliberately use often for convenience, or for necessity i.e. function closures or decorators. But as I keep running into bugs, Im thinking I need a better strategy for avoiding such problems current strategy  be careful. p  pFor example, one strategy might be to always prepend  to local variable names. But Im curious if there are not other strategies  even pythonic strategies, or community encouraged strategies.p  pI know that python 2.x differs in some regards to python 3.x in scoping  I use python 3.x.p  pAlso, strategies should consider the interactive nature of scientific computing, as would be used in an IPython Notebook venue.p  pThoughtsp  pstrongEDITstrong To be more specific, I am looking for IPython Notebook strategies.p

The occlusion buffer is mostly all white and doesnt show any occlusion. However, if I move really close to an object I can see some weird noiselike results as you can see belowp  pimg srchttpi.imgur.comybgnABe.png altweird SSAO visual resultsp  pThis is obviously not correct. Ive done a fair share of debugging and believe all the relevant variables are correctly passed around they all visualize as colors. I do the calculations in viewspace.p  pIll briefly walk through the steps and choices Ive taken in case any of you figure something goes wrong in one of the steps.p  pstrongviewspace positionsnormalsstrong John Chapman retrieves the viewspace position using a view ray and a linearized depth value. Since I use a deferred renderer that already has the worldspace positions per fragment I simply take those and multiply them with the view matrix to get them to viewspace.p  pI take a similar approach for the normal vectors. I take the worldspace normal vectors from a buffer texture, transform them to [1,1] range and multiply them with transposeinversemat3.. of view matrix. p  pThe viewspace position and normals are visualized as belowp  pimg srchttpi.imgur.comocADQ9U.png altviewspace and normals visualized SSAOp  pThis looks correct to me.p  pstrongOrient hemisphere around normalstrong The steps to create the codetbncode matrix are the same as described in John Chapmans tutorial. I create the noise texture as followsp  precodestdvectorltglmvec3gt ssaoNoise for GLuint i  0 i lt noisesize i      glmvec3 noiserandomFloatsgenerator  2.0  1.0, randomFloatsgenerator  2.0  1.0, 0.0f      noise  glmnormalizenoise     ssaoNoise.pushbacknoise  ... glTexImage2DGLTEXTURE2D, 0, GLRGB16F, 4, 4, 0, GLRGB, GLFLOAT, ampssaoNoise[0] codepre  pI can visualize the noise in the fragment shader so that seems to work.p  pstrongsample depthsstrong I transform all samples from tangent to viewspace samples are random between [1,1] on xy axis and [0,1] on zaxis and translate them to fragments current viewspace position origin. p  pI then sample from linearized depth buffer which I visualize below when looking close to an objectp  pimg srchttpi.imgur.comniN8PWD.png altdepth buffer linearizedp  pand finally compare sampled depth values to current fragments depth value and add occlusion values. Note that I do not perform a rangecheck since I dont believe that is the cause of this behavior and Id rather keep it as minimal as possible for now.p  pI dont know what is causing this behavior. I believe it is somewhere in sampling the depth values. As far as I can tell I am working in the right coordinate system, linearized depth values are in viewspace as well and all variables are set somewhat properly.p

Also, what would be the best way to iterate through each polygon and save the data Im thinking maybe of a dictionary that contains every polygon with the attributes of the intersecting lines and distance. And last, is there any more efficient way to find the intersections Its taking around 1 minute to process a single polygon and Ill probably need it to be faster in the future.p  pIf theres any information Im missing please tell me so I can edit the question.p  pThank you very much in advance, Felipe.p

Negative 45217 pI am making a website and have updated it slightly several times. I used FTP to put the new html and css files on the hosting server. When I refreshed my browser or typed the url in again, it would show me the old version. I think this must be due to the browser caching the old one. When I looked on a new browser and on a new computer, the updated website was displayed. This seems like it should be a fairly common problem and its kind of messing up my workflow.

Negative 45217 pIt appears as though the newish codepayoutcode including batch endpoints more or less match up with the older codeMassPaycode functionality. The fee structures seem to match up, with codepayoutscode having an advantage for transfers within the US. Even some of the events get logged as codeMassPaycode. It appears for all practical purposes that codepayoutscode is meant to replace codeMassPaycode.p  pWhat I havent been able to find is a definitive statement from PayPal to that effect. I have looked for an announcement from when codepayoutscode was introduced, through technical and general support documentation, and generally in every place I could think of.p  pObviously, the LACK of such a statement could say something all on its own. It just doesnt seem like it should be the case. p  pHas anyone seen an official statement that I can refer to Or, if PayPal folks are listening, is such a statement possiblep  pSomething along the lines of, PayPal is encouraging developers to build new systems needing MassPay functionality using the Payout endpoints of the REST APIp  pThanksp

As far as I can see it all works fine, however it has measurably increased the processing time, as in 10 or so. p  pIts been bugging me a bit, and I think the problem lies in the fact that Im doing a huge number of relatively cheap lt1 quantum tasks on small data fragments which are well partioned and probably make good use of cache locality, thus running optimally. My best guess, based on what little I know about MESI, is that x86 codeLOCKcode prefix in codeInterlocked.Incrementcode pushes cacheline into Exclusive mode and forces a cache miss on other cores and forces cache reload on every single parallel pass just for the sake of incrementing this counter. With 100nsish delay for cache miss and my workload it seems to add up. Then again, I could be wrongp  pNow, I dont see a way around it, but maybe I am missing something obvious. I was even thinking about using n counters corresponding to degree of parallelization and then incrementing each on specific core, however it seems unfeasible detecting which core I am on will probably be more expensive, not to mention an elaborate ifthenelse structure and messing up with the execution pipeline. Any ideas on how to break this beast p

Negative 45217 pSorry for the confusing title but I tried to condense it as best I could. To clarify, my company offers a set of products that can be downloaded for free from our website the download comes as a zip file. In our products we include some videos that are currently being hosted on our personal server, however we also have the videos being hosted on Vimeo. To cut down on server traffic and download time the question was asked, Can we just run the video download from Vimeo instead of our own server Well the answer that question is yes, in fact Vimeo if you are a pro member offers different ways of downloading your own personal videos either through their API or a permanent link within the videos settings. I have decided to go the permanent link route, so going through the video settings Vimeo offers 5 different links, each according to the quality desired YAY.p  pMy question, however, is there some way through php or html to create a drop down selection on the download page and depending on which one you select due to bandwidth, etc. the content we offer gets downloaded with the video in the correct file structure of our productp  pLet me clarify, not along side the downloaded zip, put actually inside of it.p  pFor example, say my file structure looks like thisp  precodeProduct     Books folder     Videos folder     Othercontent folder     index.html file codepre  pand the video exists at ProductVideosexample.mp4.

Negative 45217 pI have a spreadsheet which is bound to a script that queries a certain API and brings specific data to populate the spreadsheet. This spreadsheet is currently being served to users trough an iframe widget in a Google Sites page, in a way they cant see drop down menus, etc, and only the logged in user can make changes to it.p  pThen, I have created a button by drawing a form and linking a function to it. When you press the button in the spreadsheet, the api integration starts. But when you access the spreadsheet via the iframe in the page, the button does nothing. I can edit any data and if I double click it, it becomes editable, but it no longer calls the function.p  pIs there something I am doing wrong or is it some kind of limitation If it is so, is there any other way of putting a button on a web page that, when clicked on, calls the function of the sheet scriptp
Negative 45217 pI am trying to come up with an efficient way to characterize two narrowband tones separated by about 900kHz one at around 100kHZ and one at around 1MHz once translated to baseband.  They dont move much in freq over time but may have amplitude variations we want to monitor.p  pEach tone is roughly about 100Hz wide and we are required to characterize these two beasts over long periods of time down to a resolution of about 0.1 Hz.  The samples are coming in at over 2M Samplessec TBD to adequately acquire the highest tone.p  pIm trying to avoid if possible doing brute force 2MSample FFTs on the data once a second to extract frequency domain data.  Is there an efficient approach  Something akin to performing two much smaller FFTs around the bands of interest  Ive looked at Goertzel and chirp z methods but I am not certain it helps save processing.p

Negative 45217 pBasically I am trying to make an activity containing a button which reboots the device and after the reboot returns to the same activity. p  pstrongI understand that this question may get confused with others about rebooting the device, but that is not the focus of this question as I can get the device to reboot fine.strongp  pI have made the button reboot the device but the only way I can get it to start the activity after its finished rebooting is to register a broadcast receiver for codeBOOTCOMPLETEDcode in the manifest. The trouble is that this method starts the activity every time the device boots which is undesirable. When I register the receiver on the button click listener it does not start the activity after the reboot.p  pI was wondering if there might be an extra in codeBOOTCOMPLETEDcode that I could use to decide if it had been purposefully rebooted.p  pAny advice would be appreciated, thanks in advancep

How is this happening Does tickFormat not fully rely on tickValues for the emdem values How can I fix this so every value of emdem is every value of Object.keysemdateLabelMapemp  precodexAxis     .scalex     .tickValuesObject.keysdateLabelMap     .tickFormatfunctiond,i           if d in dateLabelMap              return dateLabelMap[d]                                       return       codepre  pEDIT example If I change the code to the followingp  precodevar correctDates  [] var extraDates  [] xAxis     .scalex     .tickValuesObject.keysdateLabelMap     .tickFormatfunctiond,i           if d in dateLabelMap              correctDates.pushd             return dateLabelMap[d]                                        extraDates.pushd         return       codepre  pAfter the last iteration, I get Object.keysemdateLabelMapem containsp  precode0 Fri Nov 01 2013 000000 GMT0400 Eastern Daylight Time 1 Sun Dec 01 2013 000000 GMT0500 Eastern Standard Time 2 Tue Dec 31 2013 000000 GMT0500 Eastern Standard Time 3 Sat Feb 01 2014 000000 GMT0500 Eastern Standard Time 4 Fri Feb 28 2014 000000 GMT0500 Eastern Standard Time 5 Tue Apr 01 2014 000000 GMT0400 Eastern Daylight Time 6 Wed Apr 30 2014 000000 GMT0400 Eastern Daylight Time 7 Fri May 30 2014 000000 GMT0400 Eastern Daylight Time 8 Thu Jun 26 2014 000000 GMT0400 Eastern Daylight Time 9 Tue Jul 29 2014 000000 GMT0400 Eastern Daylight Time 10 Fri Aug 29 2014 000000 GMT0400 Eastern Daylight Time 11 Wed Oct 01 2014 000000 GMT0400 Eastern Daylight Time 12 Thu Oct 30 2014 000000 GMT0400 Eastern Daylight Time 13 Wed Nov 26 2014 000000 GMT0500 Eastern Standard Time 14 Mon Dec 22 2014 000000 GMT0500 Eastern Standard Time 15 Thu Jan 29 2015 000000 GMT0500 Eastern Standard Time 16 Thu Feb 19 2015 000000 GMT0500 Eastern Standard Time codepre  pemcorrectDatesem containsp  precode0 Sun Dec 01 2013 000000 GMT0500 Eastern Standard Time 1 Tue Dec 31 2013 000000 GMT0500 Eastern Standard Time 2 Sat Feb 01 2014 000000 GMT0500 Eastern Standard Time 3 Fri Feb 28 2014 000000 GMT0500 Eastern Standard Time 4 Tue Apr 01 2014 000000 GMT0400 Eastern Daylight Time 5 Wed Apr 30 2014 000000 GMT0400 Eastern Daylight Time 6 Fri May 30 2014 000000 GMT0400 Eastern Daylight Time 7 Thu Jun 26 2014 000000 GMT0400 Eastern Daylight Time 8 Tue Jul 29 2014 000000 GMT0400 Eastern Daylight Time 9 Thu Oct 30 2014 000000 GMT0400 Eastern Daylight Time 10 Wed Nov 26 2014 000000 GMT0500 Eastern Standard Time 11 Mon Dec 22 2014 000000 GMT0500 Eastern Standard Time 12 Thu Jan 29 2015 000000 GMT0500 Eastern Standard Time 13 Thu Feb 19 2015 000000 GMT0500 Eastern Standard Time codepre  pemextraDatesem containsp  precode0 Sat Nov 16 2013 000000 GMT0500 Eastern Standard Time 1 Thu Jul 09 2015 000000 GMT0400 Eastern Daylight Time codepre  pShouldnt emcorrectDatesem be identical to Object.keysemdateLabelMapem and emextraDatesem not existp

Negative 45217 pI self taught myself PHP, so I dont know many of the advantages and disadvantages in programming styles. Recently, I have been looking at large PHP projects, like webERP, Wordpress, Drupal, etc and I have notices they all have a main PHP page that is very large 1000 lines of code performing many different functions. Whereas, my projects pages all seem to be very specific in function and are usually less than 1000 lines. What is the reasoning behind the large page, and are there any advantages over smaller more specific pagesp  pThanks for the information. p
