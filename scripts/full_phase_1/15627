Hitting pause in the VS IDE is useless, I think, because the threads dont have any context so I cant figure out what code caused the hanging.p  pNormally, I would expect that a thread executing in the background that hasnt exited and wasnt set as a Background thread would cause this behavior, but I am not creating any threads at this point.p  pCan anyone recommend a good tool free or license required that will help me quickly resolve these sorts of stupid problems  For now, Im going to go back, comment out a ton of the new code, and then uncomment line by line until the problem reappears.

Negative 15627 pIm going through a refactoring and reorganization of my application at the moment. Ive realized that some of the separation between models and views, and their controllers has diminished and I wish to do some cleaning up.p  pI have several key classes used in my app NSPersistentDocument, NSWindowController, and a model class.p  pThe NSPersistentDocument class acts as a modelcontroller it owns an instance of the model class, and manages all interactions with the model.p  pThe NSWindowController class acts as a viewcontroller it owns the main window, and manages interactions of the views within the main window. This class is also the Files Owner for the nib file in which the Window is defined.p  pThe problem I see here is that I dont have a real controller. My current design forces the modelcontroller and viewcontroller to know about each other. There is no meditating object between the two, and due to this, my model and view are not clearly separated, which makes supporting multiple views or models a problem.p  pI would like to move functionality from both of my existing controllers into a new controller class which would act as a controller between the modelcontroller and viewcontroller. In the end, this is still just the MVC design pattern, with just a little more structure.p  pHowever, I am having difficulty figuring out how this would fit into Cocoas documentbased app architecture.p  pThe biggest question I have is where and how would this new controller object be created How does this fit into Cocoas architecture Am I fighting against Cocoas architecture, and is there a better way to do thisp  pThanks.p

Negative 15627 pIm not talking about HTML tags, but tags used to describe blog posts, or youtube videos or questions on this site.p  pIf I was crawling just a single website, Id just use an xpath to extract the tag out, or even a regex if its simple. But Id like to be able to throw any web page at my extracttags function and get the tags listed.p  pI can imagine using some simple heuristics, like finding all HTML elements with id or class of tag, etc. However, this is pretty brittle and will probably fail for a huge number of web pages. What approach do you guys recommend for this problemp  pAlso, Im aware of Zemanta and Open Calais, which both have ways to guess the tags for a piece of text, but thats not really the same as extracting tags real humans have already chosen. But I would still love to hear about any other servicesAPIs to guess the tags in a document.p  pEDIT Just to be clear, a solution that already works for this would be great. But Im guessing theres no opensource software that already does this, so I really just want to hear from people about possible approaches that could work for most cases. It need not be perfect.p  pEDIT2 For people suggesting a general solution that usually works is impossible, and that I must write custom scrapers for each websiteengine, consider the a hrefhttplab.arc90.comexperimentsreadability relnofollowarc90 readability toola. This tool is able to extract the article text for any given article on the web with surprising accuracy, using some sort of heuristic algorithm I believe. I have yet to dig into their approach, but it fits into a bookmarklet and does not seem too involved. I understand that extracting an article is probably simpler than extracting tags, but it should serve as an example of whats possible.p

Negative 15627 pSo im trying to create character with two jetpacks  either of which can be fired independently of one another to create an impulse offset from the center of gravity Using Cocos2d, Chipmunk, and SpaceManager.p  pMy problem is that the by default, the impulse function doesnt take into account the current rotation of the object i.e. which way its pointing, therefor the impulse offset and direction that I use ends up being the same no matter what direction the character is pointing in.p  pIm trying to create a more realistic model  where the impulse is based on the existing rotation of the object.  Im sure I could programmatically just maintain a vector variable that holds the current direction the character is pointing and use that, but there has to be a simpler answer. p  pIv heard people write about world space vs body relative coordinates and how impulse is world space by default, and body relative would fix my problem.  Is this true  If so how do you convert between these two coordinate systemsp  pAny help you could give me would be Greatly appreciated.p

Negative 15627 pIm trying to build a system for managing the various types of content in a page.  For example, a page may have text content, hyperlink content, video content, ect.  p  pIn my modeling code, I have a base classp  precodeclass ContentItemmodels.Model     title  models.CharFieldmaxlength1000     pageorder  models.IntegerField     lastupdatedate  models.DateTimeFielddefaultdatetime.now      class Meta       abstract  True       ordering  [pageorder, lastupdatedate, title] codepre  pThis is the base class for all content items.  The page order controls what position it is on the page, for example the item with pageorder  0 should be at the top of the page.  Next I define a few specific content models that inherit from this one.p  precodeclass LinkContentContentItem   url  models.URLField   linktext  models.CharFieldmaxlenth1000  class TextContentContentItem  text  models.CharField   class VideoContentContentItem       title  models.CharField       videofile  models.FieldFielduploadto  videos codepre  pThere could be many more such content types.  Then I would define a Page model that is composed of all the various content types.  Ideally, I could put all the types in on relation based on the base type.  So in this one relation you would have a mixture of LinkContents, TextContents, and VideoContents.  They would be sorted by pageorder to determine their order on the page when rendering the template.p  precodeclass Pagemodels.Model   contents  models.ManyToManyFieldContentItem   title  models.CharField codepre  pIs there any way to make such a scheme work  Or is it problematic to have one relation with different types of models in it  I know this is a good solution from and object oriented programming standpoint, basically using polymorphism to my advantage, but I am not sure it makes sense at the database level.p  pDo I instead need something more like thisp  precodeclass Pagemodels.Model   videocontents  models.ManyToManyFieldVideoContent   linkcontents  models.ManyToManyFieldLinkContent   textcontents  models.ManyToManyFieldTextContent   title  models.CharField codepre  pI know this would work, but my scheme of determining the placement of the objects on the page becomes more difficult.  I would need to traverse all the content relations, sort them by pageorder and then render them.  p  pI think in both cases, I want to declare a render method on the base class that each specific content type can inherit.  This way if I have a list of ContentItems I can use duck typing to render them without worrying about their specific type.p  pMy final question is how do I make admin place nice with this  How would I make an easy way to see all of the ContentItems that make up a page in one view, so they can easily be moved around by changing pageorderp  pThanks for reading of this, let me know if you need more information.p

Basically the solution at hand is to create converter, which would take codeTabControl.Itemscode and convert it to the final value, but the problem is I want to animate codeMargincodes of both codeTabItemcodes, so I need to bind specifically to these properties. If I would bind to codeTabControl.Itemscode, the codeBorder.Paddingcode would not get refreshed if codeMargincode of any codeTabItemcode would change. So what should I dop  h2Updateh2  pOk, so one of the possible solutions is to hook into codeTabItem.Loadedcode event, and then use codeDependencyPropertyDescriptorcode to hook codeChangedcode event on appropriate properties, then hook all items in codeTabItem.Itemscode collection, hook any new items and automatically unhook all old items, and hook like million other stuff. But this is quite complicated and its like 400 LOC. Isnt there anything simpler Preferably in pure codeXAMLcode.p

Negative 15627 pI am working on an app that will manage students enrolled in a course. The app will have users who can log in and manipulate students. Users can also comment on students. So three of our main classes are Student, User, and Comment. The problem is that I need to associate individual comments with both of the other models User and Student. So Ive started with some basic code like this...p  precodeclass Student lt ActiveRecordBase   hasmany comments end  class User lt ActiveRecordBase   hasmany comments end  class Comment lt ActiveRecordBase   belongsto student   belongsto user   attraccessible comment end codepre  pSo in the comments table, a single record would have the following fieldsp  precodeid comment studentid userid createdat updatedat codepre  pThis presents several problems. First, the nice Rails syntax for creating associated objects breaks down. If I want to make a new comment, I have to choose between the foreign keys. So...p  precodeUser.comments.createattributes codepre  pORp  precodeStudent.comments.createattributes codepre  pAnother option is to arbitrarily pick one of the foreign keys, and manually add it to the attrs hash. So...p  precodeUser.comments.createcomment gt Lorem ipsum, studentid gt 1 codepre  pThe problem with this option is that I have to list studentid under attraccessible in my Comment model. But my understanding is that this poses a security risk since someone could technically come along and reassociate the comment with a different student using mass assignment.p  pThis leads to a further question about data modeling in general using Rails. The app Im currently building in Rails is one that I originally wrote in PHPMySQL a few years ago. When I first studied SQL, great importance was placed on the idea of normalization. So, for example, if you have a contacts table which stores names and addresses, you would use a lot of foreign key relationships to avoid repeating data. If you have a state column, you wouldnt want to list the states directly. Otherwise you could potentially have thousands of rows that all contain string values like Texas. Much better to have a separate states table and associate it with your contacts table using foreign key relationships. My understanding of good SQL theory was that any values which could be repeating should be separated into their own tables. Of course, in order to fully normalize the database, you would likely end up with quite a few foreign keys in the contacts table. stateid, genderid, etc.p  pSo how does one go about this in the Rails wayp  pFor clarification sorry, I know this is getting long I have considered two other common approaches hasmany through  and polymorphic associations. As best I can tell, neither solves the above stated problem. Heres whyp  phasmany through  works fine in a case like a blog. So we have Comment, Article, and User models. Users have many Comments through Articles. Such an example appears in Beginning Rails 3 from Apress. Great book, by the way. The problem is that for this to work if Im not mistaken each article has to belong to a specific user. In my case where my Student model is here analogous to Article no single user owns a student. So I cant say that a User has many comments through Students. There could be multiple users commenting on the same student.p  pLastly, we have polymorphic associations. This works great for multiple foreign keys assuming that no one record needs to belong to more than one foreign class.

Negative 15627 pI currently have an array of points x,y from the result of an A pathfinding function. This array is set up so that the first index is the point closest to the character and the next one is the next point that needs to be traveled in the path.p  pThese points are on a grid currently 8 pixels between each point on the grid, this is changable.p  pMy current strategy is to move the character to the first point, when he has arrived at that point, then move to the next one, simple as that.p  pI move to the first point by creating a vector from the character to that point and find how far it is. Then I find the angle and move in that direction.p  precode How the character is moved double xMove  Math.coscharAngle  Math.PI  180  0.1  delta double yMove  Math.sincharAngle  Math.PI  180  0.1  delta  x  xMove y  yMove  absVx  Math.absxMove absVy  Math.absyMove codepre  pcodeabsVXcode and codeabsVycode store the absolute distance left to go and it is decremented after each movement. If they are both below or equal to zero, then we have reached our destination, we remove it from the array and recalculate everything again with the next point.p  pI have two issues.p  ol lipSometimes the character skips over a point and then he just travels forever. This is most likely due to the delta the game engine adds to the movement slick and the character moves too far, Im not sure on this one though.pli lipThis works fine when I single click the destination but what I need is to be able to hold down the mouse button. Currently the character just stands still on the first point if I hold the mouse down.pli ol  pI had an idea for a solution to the 2nd problem but Im not sure its a good one. It is to store the location you want to go from the last mouse click but not actually calculate it untill you have passed the point you were moving to.p  pSo, I hope someone really smart and fun can have a little conversation with me about this Dp

Negative 15627 pI am trying to build a networking solution to the following problemp  pI have several stores running PCs which need to be frequently updated with new content primarily video files 40Mb.  I want to put the new content on a central server and have the PCs pull down the files.  I can write services to run on the PCs that will take care of contacting the server and downloading the content.  But, I have to find a way to minimize the total bandwidth used.  The PCs are connected to the internet but not on a domain, they are mostly Windows 7 HomePremium editions.p  pIf each PC connected only to the central server I would not be taking advantage of the fact that the neighboring PC within the same store, on the same router may already have the new files.  Ideally, that PC would be able to discover this and rather than getting the files from the central server it would get them from its neighbor.  The files are not secure and speed is only a minor concern.p  pAt first though a PeerToPeer service would be at the heart of this solution.  But, I dont know anything about PeerToPeer application development or where to start. If you have any ideas of where to start with such a solution or any thoughts on how I could solve this problem Id love to hear itp  pThank You, Jesse D.p

Negative 15627 pI have a Java object, and in it exists a spatial shape defined by a String of wellknown text.  On mouseover of this object in my GWT UI, my code passes this String to Javascript through JSNI, which in turn does a bunch of parsing and creates appropriate Bing Maps API shapes. p  pA simplified example of this would be a map application where each state exists as an object containing the states name and a string defining its perimeter. On mouseover of the states name in my UI, the perimeter string is parsed and a representative shape drawn on the map.p  pSo right now, my code does the passing, parsing, and creating every time the user mousesover my object.  Im looking for a way to parse the strings and create the objects only once each, hopefully storing the full, already created Javascript objects Bing Maps shapes in the original Java objects themselves. This, I think, should surely speed things up  the UI starts to look laggy when it has to parse and create several very detailed map objects every time the user moves the mouse to a different item.p  pemstrongIs it possible to store Javascript objects of this nature in my Java objects, and then bring them back to Javascript whenever I need thememstrongp  pIn my Java code GWT, I can create a JavascriptObject, but is this sufficient for holding something like a Microsoft.Maps.Polygon objectp  pThanksp

Negative 15627 pA recent new requirement has been presented and I am wondering what would be recommended.  p  pMy current design looks somewhat like this Presentation Layer ViewViewModelModel Service Layer WCF classes generated from ORM classes Server Model Layer ORMgenerated classes from DB Data Store Relational Databasep  pEverything works fine but now I have to implement a feature that I am wondering if I have to redo my design.  Heres the scenario I have an Employee table that the ORM generates into the Employee class, which in turn is mapped to the clientside layer Model as another Employee class that utilizes WCF to send back to the server via an EmployeeViewModel it loads the data from the service for that entity Employee and other relevant data like dropdown lists via collections of other classes and this EmployeeViewModel is in turn binds to the EmployeeView.  p  pMy Employee class is typical, e.g.p  precodepublic partial class Employee ViewEntity       other properties e.g. FirstName, etc.     [Required]     public string Address              get                        return ADDRESS                   set                      Validatevalue, Address             ADDRESS  value             OnPropertyChangedAddress                     Other methods...     public static Employee CreateEmployeeIService service, string firstName, string lastName, string address              var emp  new Employee                      FIRSTNAME  firstName,             LASTNAME  lastName,             ADDRESS  address                  service.Createemp         return emp       codepre  pThe initial requirement was that when the User entered data into the form EmployeeView, the only required fields were FirstName, LastName, and Address.  In the DB, the FIRSTNAME and LASTNAME are NOT NULLABLE and ADDRESS is NULLABLE.  So the classes abide by this DB design and thus the AddressADDRESS properties are of type Nullable string, but as you can see from my Clients Model, I decorated the Address property with a [Required] annotation and that seemed to suffice the requirement.  p  pBut now, I have a new requirement where the User is able to pick one of two values from a dropdown list and depending on the value they pick, the Address is either mandatory or not mandatory.  p  pIdeally, I would like to use all of the same classes, but not sure how to incorporate this new requirement into the above framework.  Do I have to create a new Employee class at the ORM level that inherits from Employee base type, e.g. EmployeeWithAddress, and then have that new class trickle through my Service and ViewModel  Or maybe create new ViewModels and Views  p  pAny advice would be helpful.p

Negative 15627 pIm probably going about this all wrong, but hey.p  pI am rendering a large number of wall segments for arguments sake, lets say 200. Every segment is one unit high, even and straight with no diagonals. All changes in direction are a change of 90 degrees.br I am representing each one as a four pointed triangle fan, AKA a quad. Each vertex has a three dimensional texture coordinate associated with it, such as 0,0,0, 0,1,7 or 10,1,129.p  pThis all works fine, but I cant help but think it could be so much better. For instance, every point is duplicated at least twice Every wall is a contiguous line of segments and there are some three amp four way intersections and the starting corner texture coordinates 0,0,X and 0,1,X are going to be duplicated for every wall with texture number X on it. This could be compressed even further by moving the O coordinate into a third attribute and indexing the S and T coordinates separately.p  pThe problem is, I cant seem to work out how to do this. VAOs only seem to allow one index, and taken as a lump, each position and texture coordinate form a unique snowflake never to be repeated. Admittedly, this may not be true on certain corners, but thats a very edge casep  pIs what I want to do possible, or am I going to have to stick with the admittedly fine method I currently usep

Negative 15627 pIm writing an HTML5 mobile application, and using PhoneGap to push it to the iPad.  The application is similar to the Twitter application for iPad, in that it lists a bunch of items, lets users click on those items, and potentially loads an external link within the app.  Facebook does this as well with their applications.p  pWriting an application that loads external content in an HTML5 application has proven to be an awful experience to this point.  I can dump an IFRAME on the page, but that doesnt support scrolling on the iPad out of the box.  Ive done some hacky things to wire up iscroll4 to the iframe, but its wildly inconsistent.  Scripts can jump the iframe and try to break out.  Security errors are thrown.  You have to modify the PhoneGap source to allow external requests from the iframe.  I cant make any assumptions about meta viewport, because the source is external.  The list goes on...p  pI can fix a lot of these things with individual hack work arounds and dark magic, but this whole time Ive felt like there just has to be a better way.

Negative 15627 pI currently have a model set up like sop  pI have a codeTestcode class with a foreign key to a custom codeUserProfilecode class. This property is called codestudentcode. So each UserProfile may have taken more than one codeTestcode. Then in turn, each codeUserProfilecode is tied to a codeUsercode by the typical onetoone relation. Another level of complexity is added because I have declared two user groups codetutorscode and codestudentscode. And the codeUserProfilecode class has a ManyToMany relation on to itself labeled tutors. The logic is that each student may have many tutors teaching him. Now what I would like to do is add filters on the righthand side of the Test admin page that lets you filter by the student and filter by tutor as well. setting codelistfilter  student,code simply lists all available UserProfiles. But this would include the UserProfiles which are tied to tutors as well. Obviously I would like to filter this list down to only students, because clearly filtering by any of these tutors would result in an empty queryset. I would then like to do a similar thing with filtering by tutor, where in this case the shorthand would be codelistfilter  studenttutorscode, but Id want this UserProfile set to be filtered down to only include those where useremgroupsemnametutors. What is the best way to do thisp  pFor clarity, my object model looks like thisp  precodeclass UserProfilemodels.Model     user  models.OneToOneFieldUser, uniqueTrue,relatednameprofile     tutors  models.ManyToManyFieldself,relatednamestudents class Testmodels.Model     student  models.ForeignKeyUserProfile,relatednametests codepre  pI tried subclassing codedjango.contrib.admin.SimpleListFiltercode with the followingp  precodeclass StudentListFilterSimpleListFilter     title  student     parametername  studentidexact     def lookupsself, request, modeladmin         qs  modeladmin.querysetrequest         return User.objects.filterprofileidinqs.valuesliststudentid.extraselectfullnamefirstname lastname.valueslistprofileid,fullname      def querysetself, request, queryset         if self.value is not None             return queryset.filterstudentidexactself.value         else             return queryset codepre  pWhich seems to work for the first listfilter, but the trouble is for some reason theres a bug now where the selected option does not get highlighted in the custom filter.

Negative 15627 pIm building CMS like application.p  pFor example my BlogPost page contains several widget areas. Each widget hosts a serie of related blog posts.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comDxEVx.png alttypical widgetp  pAll my views are pure presentational, i build urls, convert datetime and ints into strings in my service layer. I find this approach easier to maintain, since views have zer0 logic. All logic is consolidated into AutoMappers resolvers, converters and custom transformation logic.p  pSo lets come closer to the problem at hand. To create Url i need 2 parameters BlogId and BlogSlug, my urls look like bidslug.html Im quite happy with that.p  pIn my CSM i use so called source models, a model that is not view model, but an intermediate representation of it. Why do i have to resort to such wicked solutions  Well, lets take a look how a typical data retrieval code can look like in my projectp  precode.Selectx gt       Id  x.Id,     BlogId  x.Blog.Id,     BlogSlug  x.Blog.Slug,       Here is the trap, LINQ provider will throw an exception, since he doesnt know how to translate function into expression     BlogUrl  Url.ActionRenderPost, BlogController, new  Id  x.Blog.Id, slug  x.Blog.Slug    codepre  pSo thats not an option. Luckily, we can do thisp  precode.Selectx gt new      Id  x.Id,     BlogId  x.Blog.Id,     BlogSlug  x.Blog.Slug  .ToList .Selectx gt new       This works     BlogUrl  Url.ActionRenderPost, BlogController, new  Id  x.BlogId, slug  x.BlogSlug   codepre  pCopy paste this stuff into each and every action method that renders different intresting blog parts they have different visual representation as well cant use same view model  Not a good way, so i came up with a solution.  I created source model, so the code will bep  precode.Selectx gt new BlogPostSourceViewModel      Id  x.Id,     BlogId  x.Blog.Id,     BlogSlug  x.Blog.Slug  .ToList .Selectx gt x.ToBlogPostViewModel   Extension method  return Mapper.Mapltgt  .ToList codepre  pThis surely looks better, but i have many different models like BlogPostSourceViewModel, BlogAuthorSourceViewModel, BlogCommentSourceViewModel. They all need this link building logic. Ok, i extract the needed source data BlogId, BlogSlug into an interfacep  precodeBlogPostSourceViewModel  IBlogPostUrl BlogAuthorSourceViewModel IBlogPostUrl BlogCommentSourceViewModel  IBlogPostUrl codepre  pThen i define the mappingsp  precodeMapper.CreateMapltBlogPostSourceViewModel, BlogPostViewModelgt     .ForMemberdest gt dest.BlogUrl, opt gt opt.ResolveUsingltBlogPostUrlResolvergt Mapper.CreateMapltBlogAuthorSourceViewModel, BlogAuthorViewModelgt     .ForMemberdest gt dest.BlogUrl, opt gt opt.ResolveUsingltBlogPostUrlResolvergt Mapper.CreateMapltBlogCommentSourceViewModel, BlogCommentViewModelgt     .ForMemberdest gt dest.BlogUrl, opt gt opt.ResolveUsingltBlogPostUrlResolvergt codepre  pResolverp  precodeBlogPostUrlResolver  ValueResolverltIBlogPostUrl, Stringgt  Here goes the url building logic codepre  pAs you see the more models i have that need blog url the more identical mappings i have to add. This is ok for now, but as project grows it will be painful. Ideally i would want to have it like thisp  precodeMapper.CreateMapltIBlogPostUrl, SomeOtherInterfaceWithBlogUrlAsStringgt     .ForMemberdest gt dest.BlogUrl, opt gt opt.ResolveUsingltBlogPostUrlResolvergt codepre  pbut Automapper doesnt understand it.

Negative 15627 pI want to be able to declaratively specify the webcontrols of any given page in the standard way, embutem have the runtime not necessarily new up instances of the types I specified, but rather for instance check against web.config whether a different webcontrol which would inherit from the specified one  should be used instead.p  pfor instance I could have a webcontrol in the path templatescontrolsdefaultPersonSelector.ascx and another one in the path templatescontrolsCUSTOMERAPersonSelector.ascx inheriting from the firstp  pso if my config indicated that I preferred to load controls from the CUSTOMERA folder where available, and since it would be available in this case, the emactualem markup which was used for the page would come from ...CUSTOMERAPersonSelector.ascx. All code which compiletime assumed that it was in fact an instance of ..defaultPersonSelector.ascx would still work since it is actually a subclass.p  pThis would afaik be a major benefit to our site which is a multitenant site in which 99.5 of the generated html is identical across all our customers except for skinning, naturally but emsomeem of the customers wants different headersfootersselectionlogic etc. So far all the differences are handled by bloating the controls and ifelseing all over the place. p  pI realize that asp.net is probably not the weapon of choice for doing this kind of thing, but its the one weve got, and the codebase is large enough that a rewrite would be a pain.p

Negative 15627 pIm working on a project where we went from XHTML to HTML back to XHTML and there are some definite behavioral changes going back with regards to the page rendering before the CSS loads and scripts that read styles reading them before the CSS loads.  Can anyone shed some light on why the following is happening and what can be done about itp  pBasically, I have a page with the following structurep  precodeltbodygt     lt Content from Source A gt     ltlink hrefhttpa.example.comstyle.css gt     ltheadergt...ltheadergt      lt Content from Source B gt     ltlink hrefhttpb.example.comstyle.css gt     ltdivgt...ltdivgt      lt Content from Source A gt     ltfootergt...ltfootergt     ltscript srchttpa.example.comscript.jsgt          e.g.          alertheader.offset.height     ltscriptgt ltbodygt codepre  pWhen we were in HTML rendering mode, the page blocks rendering at expected points.  When we hit the Source A CSS, rendering pauses blank screen when we hit the Source B CSS, rendering pauses header is visible.  When we hit the Source A JavaScript, rendering pauses full page shown and the script reads element styles from their rendered state.  In reality, of course, WebKit doesnt stop parsing the DOM or executing JavaScript while the CSS loads, but it does halt execution at the first point where the script needs to read a style.p  pWhen we are in XHTML mode, the page doesnt halt rendering at all and will render the entire page completely unstyled.  After that, it appears to process the scripts and stylesheets in the order loaded, or rather it executes the scripts in order but doesnt wait for the stylesheet to load before executing a loaded script.  This means that the page will render three times unformatted, with one stylesheet, and with two stylesheets and the script may infer completely inaccurate values for element sizes.p  pCan someone shed light on this  This is happening in all WebKit browsers Ive tested, including Chrome 17, Mobile Safari 5, and Android Browser 2.1.  Is there any way to ensure HTML render ordering without resorting to the codetexthtmlcode mime typep

The next thing Im going to try is to change the line height, for the size.  Im more worried about not getting everything aligned, though.  As long as everything lines up, it looks nice to me.  Can someone help me figure out why it isnt aligned  Also, please ask if you need any additional details.p  pIve also tried codedisplayinlinecode and various codefloatcode settings.p

Negative 15627 pIm working with Python and Jython to deploy applications to WebSphere. However, we are running into an issue with the WAS libraries where calls to these actions will sometimes take up to 30 minutes to execute.

Negative 15627 pOkay, so I recently set up a Google account for use at my job. We are using Google Calendar to set up the schedules for the meeting rooms. What I have been doing is using the XML to make the events viewable to anyone. However, I want to use the embed code to just create an HTML file because the calendar has a much nicer UI, unlike the boring list of events like the XML is.p  pThe XMLHTML file is stored on a public folder on our server, so anyone has access to it and can check the schedule at any time.p  pMy problem is that I am terrible at programming Ive taken only two classes on it, so I dont know how to set up an authentication system to log in and make the calendars viewable especially not in HTML. I could probably get around this by just making the calendars public, but I would prefer not to do that. Is there any way to include the account username and password in the HTML code, perhaps using the Google API Specifically, Ive been trying with HTML4 Strict, but Im certainly open to other options.p  pIf anyone has any tips or can kind of walk me through the process, that would be awesome p  pEDIT Here is the code I have so far.

Negative 15627 pWhat is considered to be best practice when extending the Velocity syntax. The two mechanisms available are Directives and Macros. Both look equally powerful. Directives require actual development of Java code, while Macros are just snippets of Velocity syntax.p  pThe advantages of Directives being that because they are written in Java, you do not have to parse the extra Velocity syntax contained within the Macro. It makes the extension of Velocity more formal, and stops lots of uncontrolled additions.p  pOn the plus side for Macros, I see this as being very flexible, and allowing a lot of reuse as common patterns are discovered during the development of the application.p  pSo, your thoughts in this area would be most welcome.p
Negative 15627 pIm using the CSS wordwrap property set to breakword to display a single nospaced string in its entirety within a div element of fixed width and variable height. The div element itself is within a table cell codelttdgtcode. The word break works as expected, breaking the word at the defined fixed width. However, in IE9 with IE7 document standards, there appears to be some extra space after the div, causing the table cell to extend in width not desired. The div width itself appears to be correct, as specified by its CSS. I used borders around the div and table cell to verify. Ive tried explicitly setting the table cell width and maxwidth but neither approach works. This behaviour is not observed in Firefox or Chrome.p  pEdit Added sample code a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netgmDpe5 relnofollowherea. The problem only occurs with IE BrowserModeIE9 DocumentModeIE7.p

Negative 15627 pI am using AIR to do some augmented reality using fudicial marker tracking. I am using FLARToolkit and it works fine, except the frame rate drops to ridiculous lows in certain lighting conditions. This is because Flash only uses the CPU for processing, and every frame it is applying filters, adjusting thresholds, and analyzing the pixels to find the marker pattern. Without any hardware acceleration, it can get really slow.p  pI did some searching and it looks like the fastest and most stable tracking library is Studierstube  a hrefhttphandheldar.icg.tugraz.atstbtracker.php relnofollowhttphandheldar.icg.tugraz.atstbtracker.phpa and a hrefhttpstudierstube.icg.tugraz.atdownload.php relnofollowhttpstudierstube.icg.tugraz.atdownload.phpa . Unfortunately, I am not a C developer. But it seems that the tracking is insanely fast using this tracker especially since it isnt all CPU processing like Flash is.p  pSo my plan is to build or rather have someone build a small C program that leverages this tracker, and then sends the marker position data every frame only need 30 FPS to my Flash client application to display back the video and some augmented reality experiences. I believe this would be done through a socket server or something right Is this possible and fairly easy for someone who is a decent C developer I would ask himher but I am in search for such a person.p

Negative 15627 pSo initially I was coding a marketing email application that send emails to thousands of recipients. I was naively doing something like thisp  precodeforall emails      HtmlEmail email  new HtmlEmail     email.setBodytheHtml     email.addTocurrentEmail     email.send  codepre  pThe issue with the above is that after so many emails, the garbage collector has to kick in and remove the stale HtmlEmail objects which eats up a bunch of CPU. I am now trying to do something like belowp  precodeHtmlEmail email  new HtmlEmail email.setBodytheHtml  forall emails      Option1 Use below line of code but need to remove the previous current email that is, not send this to all the previous recipients AND the new one     Line to remove previous email from HtmlEmail object     email.addTocurrentEmail, currentName     or option 2 email.setTonew String[]currentEmail  codepre  pThe uncommented methods issue is that addTo does not remove previous added email addresses. I certainly do not want to send the same emails to the same recipients. VERY VERY DISASTROUS. So if I do that method, I would need a way of removing the previous email. I want to do something like p  precodeemail.setToArrays.asListnew String[] codepre  pThe issue with this is that the api states that all containing strings must be valid email addresses or it will throw an exception. The other option would be to use codeemail.setTocode everytime, but then the recipients name cannot be included. Can anyone suggest a method to do one of the above If you need clarification I understand that it is a little hard to put into words. Thanks in advance.p
Negative 15627 pI just ran a test creating 1000 nonpersistent connections to mongodb via nginxphp fastcgi which took about 2.1 seconds on my dev machine. I then tried the same test using persistent connections, same result. I think I read somewhere that persistence in the php driver is now always enabled anyway. Next, I tried storing the connections to APC which resulted in a 79ms response time after the first request. Now Im wondering a few things herep  ol lipTheres almost never a time I can think of where Id want to create more than one connection in my app at once and with a persistent connection from what I understand, new connections are created as needed by the mongo driver.pli lipCreating a single connection seems to take about the same time as pulling the stored connection object from APC. Will caching the connection object ever really provide a benefitpli lipCaching the connection I know of course would still require some sort of check to see if its even still a valid connection.. in performing this check each time, I wonder if it would negate the performance gain if any from pulling it from cache.pli ol  pI cant seem to really find any material really covering any of this so Im assuming its because Im confused in my understanding.

Negative 15627 pIm working on a project with a couple of developers. Currently all of them store their work on an ftp server and they arent using any VCS. Because of that, I have create my own local git repository so I could have a history of the changes. p  pThe way Im merging everything is similar to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma2943235393805thisa answer. I have a branch for the ftp code, then I would download the latest code from the ftp, afterwords I would commit and merge. My only problem is that its becoming a mess  I cant track which files are deleted from the ftp. I can only see the new files and the changed ones.p  pIs there another beter solutionp
Negative 15627 pI know the question has been posted before, not answered thoroughly though. Also I think it still depends on the problem parameters. Lets say you have a SaaS service with a stronglotstrong of customers but with relatively small amount of data per customer, it probably makes sense to have a single database. p  pWhat happens in the case where your customers will longterm be not in the range of thousands eg. 100 in a very good scenario and start with 5  6 but you have stronglots of data per customerstrong this time eg. a business intelligence service which aggregates and processes tons of data. To give you a hint, 25  50GB of data to process analytics and other stuff per customer initially, as a start and then add about 10GB per year per customer. p  pIf you go down the path of a strongsingle dbstrong, then you tag the data to a customer with a specific field indexed of course and then emrely on a replication and shardingem system which is pretty straightforward thanks to mongo. I assume  havent tested and if you have such case please share some insight that in a sharded collection against indexed fields query lookup time should be fast.  However lets say you add another customer now, another 50 GBs spread accross 8  10 collections, hence many millions of items  collection. You either have to  1 drop indexes and rebuild them  i guess thats the worst because system becomes practically unusable  2 dont drop and insert with indexes it will take forever, system will be responsive 3 I would think in a replica set take down a node, drop indexes, update with new customer, bring back indexes and then have it join the replica set so that they can begin syncing. p  pIn the other hand, if you have strongone db per customerstrong, adding or removing can be done relatively quickly because the system practically isolates its customer, rows are in still in the range of many millions but not close to billion, which is good and lookup times are obviously fast. Whatever your doing in this case, its much easier and quicker in terms of implementation simply because you will always work with a relatively smaller number than in the case of a single db. However when it comes to emmaintenanceem replication amp sharding because you will keep adding more data per customer its going to be a emfrictionem for sure  Plus in this case I would probably assume that you have to physically isolate dbs in seperate machines  instances, because of the OS limit of number of open files and of course there would be an extra overhead due to multiple simultaneous connections in multiple dbs. p  pIf I missed something please do shed some light, but I am most interested to hear other opinions on this... p  pThanksp

Negative 15627 pI am trying to understand how Ember RunLoop works and what makes it tick. I have looked at a hrefhttpemberjs.comapiclassesEmber.run.htmlthe documentationa, but still have many questions about it. I am interested in understanding better how RunLoop works so I can choose appropriate method within its name space, when I have to defer execution of some code for later time. p  ul liWhen does Ember RunLoop start. Is it dependant on Router or Views or Controllers or something elseli lihow long does it approximately take I know this is rather silly to asks and dependant on many things but I am looking for a general idea, or maybe if there is a minimum or maximum time a runloop may takeli liIs RunLoop being executed at all times, or is it just indicating a period of time from beginning to end of execution and may not run for some time.li liIf a view is created from within one RunLoop, is it guaranteed that all its content will make it into the DOM by the time the loop endsli ul  pForgive me if these are very basic questions, I think understanding these will help noobs like me use Ember better.p

Negative 15627 pI have a mixed CC program.  It contains a flexbison parser which targets C, while the remainder is C.p  pBeing C, the generated parser and scanner manage their memory with codemalloccode, coderealloccode and codefreecode.  They are good enough to expose hooks allowing me to submit my own implementations of these functions.  As you might expect, the rest of the C program wants to use codenewcode, codedeletecode, etc.p  pDoing a little research seems to show that the relevant standards do not guarantee that such mixing should work.  Particularly the C heap is not necessarily the C free area.  It seems the two schemes can trample each other. p  pOn top of this, someday soon this program will probably want to integrate a customized heap implementation such as a hrefhttpgoogperftools.sourceforge.netdoctcmalloc.html relnofollowtcmalloca, used by both C and C.p  pstrongWhat is the right thing to do herestrongp  pGiven the desire to integrate tcmalloc which explains how to link with C programs Im tempted to find some crosstype, crossthread, crosseverything overloadhookwhatever into C memory management.  With that I could point all C allocationrelease calls back to their C equivalents which in turn land on tcmalloc.p  pDoes such a pangalactic global C hook exist  Might it already be doing what I want, similar to how codeiosbasesyncwithstdiocode secretly marries iostream and stdio by defaultp  pI am not interested in talking about stdio vs. iostreams, nor about switching parser generators nor using the C flexbison skeletons they introduce independent headaches.p  pstrongEDITstrong Please include the names of those sections of the C standard that support your answer.p

Negative 15627 pIm using Visual Studio 2010 with ViEmu 2.5, and recently added ReSharper 7.1, which causes a problem When Im in normal mode and press Enter, its now creating a new line within the comment whereas in vi normal mode, Enter should just emmoveem to the first nonblank on the next line, not insert one. Its driving me a bit batty.p  pemUpdate Ooh, it also interferes if Im in a doc comment and type codecode to start typing an ex command I can type the command but I cant press Enter to excute itemp  pIts definitely ReSharper thats causing this to happen either directly, or by somehow making the keystroke bypass ViEmu and go to VSs default handling, as it only started when I installed ReSharper, suspending ReSharper makes it stop, and resuming ReSharper makes it start again.p  pInterestingly, this doesnt happen emoutsideem documentation comments. Enter in vi normal mode outside doc comments works normally.p  pIve kicked around the settings and a couple of questions here like a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions87381resharperandviemukeybindingsandvisualassistthis onea, but havent yet found a way to get those keystrokes back to ViEmu.

Negative 15627 pI have a simple DevExpress ASP.MVC GridView and I would like to produce a PDF export of the data in the grid. I have worked out how to produce an export of all the data, but Id like to be able to only export data that appears in the grid. This will allow users to sort and filter data and only have that data appear in the export.p  pThe sorting and filtering all appears to happen client side and Ive searched the DevExpess documentation and inspected the client side grid object and cannot find the information I need. Ive also tried handling the grids client side events. The only success Ive had here is by handling the codeColumnSortingcode event. Using this I can record each sort as it happens, but this does not tell me what direction the sort is in, and whether the sort is applied solely to the column provided in the event or to that column as part of a multiple column sort.p  pThe only option I have left is to use additional form controls external to the grid to control the sorting and filtering. Id really rather not do this as my client is very keen on the builtin sorting and filtering functionality.p  pPlease can somebody tell me how I can capture the current sorting and filtering settings applied by the user so I can pass them to the controller action that will produce the PDFp

Unless maybe there is a MySQL query I could do Maybe organize the column differently.

I have some complex mathematics that can find all possible combinations. But since I have placed in alphabetical order, Im only searching combinations  not permutations. And on top of that, I dont emneedem to as far as I logically believe, query each combination. As there are 792 possible 5 letter combinations from only 12 letters without calculating repeating characters. So 792 query calls is not nice  and 792 OR statements in my query, is clearly not an option. LOL. p  pAny suggestionsp  pI did just think about searching via available characters left from alphabet  but, some words have repeating letters so thats not an option either.p

So its not a problem of positioning or of z. The time is running out because, after a time implemented in the code, the game goes to gameover. The problem is just that the bar is not shown in the view.p  pThis is the code in the init functionp  precode    remainingTime  MaxTime     bar  [CCSprite spriteWithFilebarra.png]     bar  [CCProgressTimer progressWithSpritebarra]     bar.type  kCCProgressTimerTypeBar     [bar setPositionccp50 , size.height  18]     [bar setPercentage100]     [self addChildbar]     NSLogbar added Here f f, bar.position.x, bar.position.y codepre  pIve tried to put codez10000code but nothing...the timer goes on but the bar is hidden..p

Negative 15627 pIm new to CMake and I have a problem that I can not figure out a solution to. Im using CMake to compile a project with a bunch of optional subdirs and it builds shared library files as expected. That part seems to be working fine. Each of these subdirs contains a sql file. I need to concat all the selected sql files to one sql header file and install the result. So one file likep  precodesqlheader.sql subdirA.sql subdirC.sql subdirD.sql codepre  pIf I did this directly in a make file I might do something like the following only smarter to deal with only the selected subdirsp  precodecat sqlheader.sql  gt INSTALLPATHsomefile.sql cat subdirA.sql  gtgt INSTALLPATHsomefile.sql cat subdirC.sql  gtgt INSTALLPATHsomefile.sql cat subdirD.sql  gtgt INSTALLPATHsomefile.sql codepre  pI have sort of figured out pieces of this, like I can usep  precodeLISTAPPEND PACKAGESQLFILES somefile.sql codepre  pwhich I assume I can place in each of the subdirs CMakeLists.txt files to collect the file names.

Maybe there is a better way to do this. I need this to work on both Windows and Linux.p  pI would be happy with some hints to point me in the right direction.p

Negative 15627 pIm looking at the possibility to create Japanese learning site with some basic interactivity in the form of exercises for the readers. Suppose I have a table like sop  precode  characters  definition  roman letters         hello        ltinput typetextgt      ...                      ltinput typetextgt              ltgrade buttongt ltshow answers buttongt ltclear fields buttongt  codepre  pSo the user reads the characters, learns the definition and writes it in the input fields with roman letters. When he or she is finished, he can check his answers by pushing the grade button, which will mark the input text in red or green color. Or they can give up and show the answers with the second button, and then clear the answers with the third.p  pThe way this is done now, is that I have an ID for the table and have 3 Javascript functions that does the work described above. The first one takes and ID and an array of correct answers, then sets the colors of all the input fields according to the right answers with JQuery. For example, if the ID for the table is codeex1code then I use the selectors codeex1 textcode. The second button also needs an ID and an array of correct answers. The third button needs only the ID for the table.p  pSo in the HTML I for a table I would have something likep  pcodeltbutton onclickgradeex1, [some, array, with, answers]codep  pcodeltbutton onclickshowAnswersex1, [some, array, with, answers]codep  pcodeltbutton onclickclearex1codep  pThis works, but is somewhat ugly because I repeadetly use the same arguments. So can anyone suggest a better approachp  pEdit I need to have more than one of these per page.p

Negative 15627 pI am new to IoC and Repository Pattern. I was able to do some test project and it works. But, I am not so sure if what I implemented is a good practice. The test project I have created have all the repositories in place as well as a working interface with a dummy data. But what I want is that my project should not be able to know the concrete types of my models because the initial version should be implemented using MSSQL, and the second version would be a mix of MSSQL and NoSQLfor reads and logging. The models might have different properties or structures from MSSQL to NoSQL or whatever i might use in the futurep  pSo I tried to create an interface for each modelp  precodepublic interface ISearchResult      string Id  get set      string Name  get set      string Description  get set      string Url  get set   codepre  pAnd heres the repositoryp  precodepublic interface ISearchRepositoryltTgt where T class, ISearchResult      IEnumerableltTgt SearchltTgtstring keyword, IEnumerableltstringgt regions, IEnumerableltstringgt industries,IEnumerableltstringgt countries, IEnumerableltstringgt cities, int offset  codepre  pAnd heres the servicep  precodepublic interface ISearchService      IEnumerableltTgt SearchltTgtstring keyword, IEnumerableltstringgt regions, IEnumerableltstringgt industries,IEnumerableltstringgt countries, IEnumerableltstringgt cities, int offset  codepre  pBecause I want to have a working GUI even without MSSQL or NoSQL entities, I have created a View Model that inherited the ISearchResultp  precodepublic class SearchResultViewModel  ISearchResult      [DisplayNameReference Id]     public string Id  get set      [DisplayName  Company]     public string Name  get set      [DisplayName  Description]     public string Description  get set      [DisplayName  Website]     public string Url  get set   codepre  pAnd heres how it looks on my controllerp  precode[SearchQueryFilter] [GeoTargetFilter] public ActionResult QuerySearchQueryModel searchQuery       searchQuery.Results  this.searchService.SearchltSearchResultViewModelgtsearchQuery.Keyword,searchQuery.Region, new Listltstringgt  searchQuery.Industries , new Listltstringgt  searchQuery.Countries, new Listltstringgt searchQuery.City, searchQuery.Offset             .ToListltISearchResultgt          return ViewsearchQuery   codepre  pAnd my view would look like thisp  precodeforeach SearchResultViewModel result in Model.Results       code to display  codepre  pMy question is Is it fine to use this approach I dont want my web application to be dependent on my data entities so thats why I came up of making my view models inherit an interface.

Previously weve been provided a list of 301s and have added them to global.asax on request or web.config and let .NET do the rest.p  pI was wondering if there is any accepted best way to do dynamic 301s.p  pPersisting the redirects I can do in XMLSQL no problem. Im guessing though there would be a performance hit if we read xmlqueried the DB on every request.p  pI could of course cache them  but where Application context would seem the obvious place but Im wary of saving hundreds of 301s in Application. Considering how 301 happy SEO experts can get I dont want them to add thousands then wonder why the server fell over. Is this a valid concern Or in Cache Has the advantage of letting .NET manage memory so they will be cleared if resources become scarce and can always be recreated. Does it offer any advantage over Application thoughp  pI could add a config xml file, update this via the CMS and reference it from the web.config  would this work or would the site need to be recycled to pick up changesp  pTo clarify, storing and executing the 301s is not an issue. Im after a method of checking 301s and redirecting that will be quick without impacting the users experience.p

Negative 15627 pThe following is a simplified example of what Im really trying to do, but my question about it is the same.p  pSuppose I have two objects, Man and Woman, both of which have the same Properties Age, Height and Weight, but they are two distinct objects. I cannot change that.p  pNow suppose that I have a WPF panel, made using the MVVM principle that shows the Age of a certain Man in a textbox. I use TextBinding PathOnePerson.Age for that, where OnePerson is an object of the type Man defined in the viewmodel. p  pThis works fine, but I want a similar page to display this information of a Woman. Ideally, Id like to just use the same view and viewmodel as before. But this is tricky, because the databinding points to the Manobject OnePerson. I can change the databinding programmatically as described in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6988273wpfbindingprogramaticallyWPF Binding Programaticallya, but I can only do so from the views codebehind. Im not allowed to do that, because were using the MVVM model. p  pI would like to make OnePerson refer to either a Man or Woman object, but I dont know a good way to do so. They are different types, so I cant just assign either a Man or Woman using an if statement. I could declare OnePerson as an object instead of as a type, but then I cant access the Age, Height and Weight properties so easily anymore. Or I could make an entirely different ViewModel, one of which declares OnePerson as a Man and the other as a Woman, and use the same View for both of them. I think that should work, but it seems a bit weird to have two viewmodels for a single view. And adding my own Person class and translating between that and either Man or Woman would probably just make the whole viewmodel considerably more complicated when I start adding functionality like adding a new ManWoman or editing an existing one, to the point where I might as well copypaste the Man view and viewmodel and change only the OnePerson object to a Woman.p  pMy question is, is there a clean and simple way to use a single View and Viewmodel to display the information of either a Man or a Woman in this case. Or should I not bother and make seperate pages for these casesp  pHope this is clear enough.p

Negative 15627 pI have a json function that connects to a database and returns a result. It does this about 15 times or for how many comments there are in the database. The json function is inside a while loop, and repeats itself until all the comments have been taken from the database or until it reached 15 comments.

Negative 15627 pThis question has come up at my job a few times, and I was hoping to get some community backing.p  pWe are working on a Single Page WebApp, but require that the data coming from our services API be secure to prevent snooping of the data. We are also trying to iron out the prod environment details for where our SPA will be hosted. One of the options is using something like Amazons S3, which doesnt support SSL to my knowledge.p  pTheres a group that believes the whole site needs to be hosted over SSL. However, its my understanding that SSL will only protect the transmission of the data. So the point Im trying to make is that hosting the services from an HTTPS site and the client code from nonSSL based URLs will be just as secure as hosting everything from an SSL site.p  pCould anyone clarify this for mep  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 15627 pI have a thrift service that has two methodsbr 1. Response processSyncRequest req   This method synchronously processes requests and returns a response. The client thread gets blocked until the request is completely processed by the server.br 2. void processAsyncRequest req   This method is for asynchronous processing. Here as soon as the server completely receives the request, the call returns with no output. Client thread does not wait until the request is processed by the server. p  pWhile using ThreadedSelectorServer that has separate threads for readingwriting and processing of threads. The requirement is to use separate thread pools at the method level. This is because it might happen that the all the processing threads get busy with synchronous requests. Clients using the asynchronous api might timeout. I wish to give both apis equal weightage so that if the server is flooded with sync requests the async requests do not suffer.  p  pThought of having two different services, one with only sync method and another one with async. But in that case two thrift servers have to be started which shall require two different ports.I wish to avoid doing that.     p  pAny suggestions how this can be achieved p

Negative 15627 pBinding to an codeltoptiongtcode in a codeltselectgtcode box does not work in IE8 if the codeltselectgtcode box is in an codengswitchwhencode block of a codengSwitchcode directive.

Negative 15627 pI searched a lot and found many answer on how to implement certificate based authenticate in wcf. But my questions are related to fundamental of it.p  pWhile implementing Certificate based authentication on production, does client provides its certificate which server needs to add on its trusted people store Or server provides a certificate signed by server.p  pI guess while configuring wcf server, we just configure certificate location and store. We never bind it with any domain. So any client that present this certificate can access my service. And in case certificate needs to be bound to a domain. They why cannot we just allow all requests from that domain.p  pWhen client calls a wcf service, it present its certificate. Does this certificate only carry public key And can this certificate by stolen as it travels on network and used by hacker to consume the web service.p  pI have idea about how ssl woks. In case of ssl, browser take care of all this stuff but in case of wcf service when we want to allow only specific client to access our service how it gets managed.p  pThanks In advance.p  pstrongLet me make it simple strongp  ol liI want to create a web service and i want that three clients A, B and C can use it. I want to authenticate these three clients by certificate. While setting up, do these clients need to send their certificates to me. Or I have to create certificate for them Will client share their private key as well while setting upli liDo I need to put these certificates into trusted people storeli liWhen they request for webservice, they will present their certificate with public key only. If they present it with public key only, hackers can steal this public key and request for my web service. How will my webservice distinguish between hackeractual client.li ol

Negative 15627 pI was wondering is there away in css to use the same key animations on elements that have a delay. For example I have a list of elements that have the same class and for each element it uses key animations but there is delay for each element for 1 second each so they dont play at the same time but one after the other. If you can do this in css could someone show me how to do this in jsFiddle please and leave a message, thanks from KDMp

Negative 15627 pWe are trying to determine the best approach for adding a complex API layer to a modified version of nopCommerce.  To back up a step, were building out a custom site for a fashionapparel manufacturer that has a lot of frontend application requirements and also needs to integrate with their cross platform apps iOS, Android, Windows which were building with Xamarin.  Weve tentatively decided to start with nopCommerce as the base of our application to which we will add an API layer.  p  pWhat we are unsure about is what is the best approach for implementing this in nopCommerce or other similar .NET package  The options we are considering are MVC vs WebAPI vs ServiceStack.  Weve been going thru many of the tutorials on PluralSight.com to get up to speed on app dev and API creation best practices, but there seem to be so many options, were not sure where to start.   We seem to be somewhat lost in a sea of implementation options for the API and how each is to be evaluated based on choice of the JS packagesframeworks used on the frontend for the web site and the tools chosen to create the apps.  p  pIf it matters, our basic requirements arep  ul lipExpand core of basic ecommerce package with some custom ERP style functionalitypli lipAPI layer that can work effectively with both a web front end possibly as a SPA and all cross platform apps built using Xamarinpli lipInsure OAuth authentication across all interface types so we can just use social media logins consistently everywhere and can authenticate the user in any environmentpli ul  pGiven this...p  pMy question boils down to which of the three API methods MVC vs WebAPI vs ServiceStack is best for this  p

Negative 15627 pIm new here so I hope you wont lose your patience too quickly D I have an algorithmic problem which Im not sure how to solve. I have looked for something similar on stack overflow and there was even someone who posted a question resembling mine very much, but few minor details made it impossible to adapt the solution here.p  pI have a rectangular area in the coordinate system with some points within. I want to create parcels based on the points. A parcel is a rectangle which has exactly one point inside. The sides of a parcel can be either included in the borders of the area or they can be drawn somewhere within the area provided that each of them strikes through at least one point. Some examples of correct parcelsp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.coms1IEz.jpg altp  pThe problem is, I have to return strongthe minimum number of parcels which would make all points occupiedstrong. So in the above case I think one of the solutions could bep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comM5Ey5.jpg altp  pSo strongthe correct answer would be 3strong. p  pI think it is worth starting from creating a parcel in the corner because then the remaining points are scattered in only two directions. If we start from creating a parcel in the middle of the set, then chances are points are scattered everywhere, in each direction, and since parcels cant cross each other, we would have to use more parcels.p  pThe problem is, I dont know if my reasoning is right and I cant think of a proper algorithm based on it. Do you guys find it reasonable or is there a completely different method I didnt think ofp

However, if the  sign is removed from the cell and a valid decimal results in the cell, the value seems to be updated on the bound object before the cell is tabbed from and my code to deal with the change is not fired.p

After the simulation the data will not be changed anymore. For every simulation I will create a new database. The current programminglanguages are java for one project and python for a second.

Negative 15627 pI am working in a javabased system where I need to set an id for certain elements in the visual display. One category of elements is Strings, so I decided to use the String.hashCode method to get a unique identifier for these elements.p  pThe problem I ran into, however, is that the system I am working in borks if the id is negative and codeString.hashCodecode often returns negative values. One quick solution is to just use Math.abs around the hashcode call to guarantee a positive result. What I was wondering about this approach is what are the chances of two distinct elements having the same hashcodep  pFor example, if one string returns a hashcode of 10 and another string returns a hashcode of 10 an error would occur. In my system were talking about collections of objects that arent more than 30 elements large typically so I dont think this would really be an issue, but I am curious as to what the math says.p

Negative 15627 pIm working on an interesting bug here which I have a theory about and would love some other opinions.  The issue Im having is a javascript formatting script does not seem to be working on an input type of strongnumberstrong, but it does work on an input type of text.  Working fiddle belowp  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netTFME5 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netTFME5ap  pIn Firefox, if you just start typing in numbers in both fields, itll auto format both as a US social security number 123456789.  If you try the same in Chrome where number type is supported, youll see it wont work in the number text field. It basically wipes out the value when the formatting script starts writing out the hyphen.p  pMy theory here is that the formatting script is outputting an invalid number, i.e., when it rewrites something like 1234, it bombs out because thats not a valid floating point number.p  pI pretty much fleshed out this theory by keying in 1234 in the number field, then hitting the updown arrows in that fields chrome.  Up gives you 1, down gives 1, so 1234 is being treated as 0, which Im assuming is the browser saying nopep  pWhere this is problematic for me is on mobile where, on numeric entry, I want to present a numeric keyboard with input typenumber, but that doesnt look like its going to happen with the autoformatting.  Im running into the same problems with autoformatting dates with .  Again, assuming its because Im ouputting invalid numbers.p  pThe autoformatting works fine on mobile when using input typetext, but you dont get the nicer UX keyboard feature with a numeric keyboard.  Also, input typetel doesnt give me any problems, but then Im assuming this is because that hyphen is valid in that contextp  pHas anyone run into this before Is my theory soundp  precodeFormatSSN  functione  var val  this.value.replaceDg, , only want numbers     len  val.length,     first,     middle,     last  if len gt 3 ampamp len lt 6      first  val.slice0,3     middle  val.slice3,5     this.value  first    middle  else if len gt 5      first  val.slice0,3     middle  val.slice3,5     last  val.slice5,9     this.value  first    middle    last    document.onkeyup, ssntext, FormatSSN document.onkeyup, ssnnumber, FormatSSN codepre

Negative 15627 pI have built application that uses MongoDB and I have came across problem with testing.p  pAs long as I used JPA and some relational database I used some test layer which switched persistence to inmemory database linke HSQLDB or MySQL for test purposes. This way I was able to limit IO operations and speed up tests. However with MongoDB and Spring Data it is very convenient to use repositories based on interfaces extending MongoRepository.p  pMy question is how to deal with unit testing and functional testing when using repositories For example I have simple class that is anotated as mongo documentp  precodepublic class Company   Id private String id NotEmpty private String name private String description private String website private String logo  public String getName      return name   public void setNameString name      this.name  name   public String getDescription      return description   public void setDescriptionString description      this.description  description   public String getWebsite      return website   public void setWebsiteString website      this.website  website   public String getLogo      return logo   public void setLogoString logo      this.logo  logo       codepre  pand related repositoryp  precodeRepository public interface CompanyRepository extends MongoRepositoryltCompany, Serializablegt   codepre  pIt is used in coresponding controllerp  precodeRestController public class CompanyController   private static final Logger log  LoggerFactory.getLoggerCompanyController.class Autowired private CompanyRepository repository  RequestMappingvalue  company, method  RequestMethod.POST public void createValid RequestBodyrequired  true Company company      repository.savecompany   codepre  pFinally I made two tests however it could be one covering both tasks that covers controller api and data format where I mock repository to prevent from IO operations, and it works nice, and second where I want to make sure that passed object was persisted successfuly. As it cames out it is not so simple. First of all correct me if Im wrong there is no inmemory mongo implementation. Secondly, I cannot verify with mockito execution of save method because of inheritance I suppose.p  precodeContextConfigurationclasses  Application.class WebAppConfiguration public class CompanyControllerNGTest extends AbstractTestNGSpringContextTests   Mock private CompanyRepository repositoryMock Autowired InjectMocks private CompanyController controller private MockMvc mockMvc  BeforeMethod public void setUp      MockitoAnnotations.initMocksthis   DataProvider public static Object[][] companyJsonProvider      return new Object[][]         Json.createObjectBuilder             .addname, JakasFirma             .adddescription, jakas firma opis             .addwebsite, www.jakasfirma.com             .addlogo, jakies logo             .build, status.isOk,         Json.createObjectBuilder             .addname, JakasFirma             .build, status.isOk,         Json.createObjectBuilder             .adddescription, jakas firma opis             .addwebsite, www.jakasfirma.com             .addlogo, jakies logo             .build, status.isBadRequest,         Json.createObjectBuilder             .build, status.isBadRequest,        TestdataProvider  companyJsonProvider, enabled  false public void apiTestJsonObject companyJson, ResultMatcher expectedStatus throws Exception      given     mockMvc  MockMvcBuilders.standaloneSetupcontroller.build     String content  companyJson.toString      when     mockMvc.performpostcompany.contentTypeMediaType.APPLICATIONJSON.contentcontent.             then             andExpectexpectedStatus    Test public void shouldCreate throws Exception      given      when     controller.createmockCompany.class      then     verifyrepositoryMock, times1.saveanyIterable.class   codepre  pI thought about introducing a dao layer between controller and repository that could be mocked and verified bot it adds more complexity and force to encapsulate each method used by repository. Also it doesnt fix problem but partially moves it to lower level. Is there any method or practice that could help to deal with this kind of problem Or maybe I should use different approach with mongop

However it is not a pop up in a usual sense that it would create another window but rather a pop up within the current windowtab. E.g.

Negative 15627 pI have to improve the build process in a project that I am currently working on. There are several sub projects in the main project. We currently use maven2.1 as a build tool and svn  for version control. It takes around one and a half hours to do a Java build let alone packaging and deploying another one hour. The main bottle neck I found in the build process is the phase where all the code is checked out which takes around 3040 mins. Is there a better way of doing this Is there any other way in which the builds can be run parallely for subprojects  Also the packaging and the installation tools are written in JAVA. Is there any better option to this to increase the performance Any ideas will be very helpful.  p  pNoteChanging the underlying version control is not possible now that will require approvals up the management hierarchy.p

Negative 15627 pSorry if the question seems silly.. Im still learning Java. I just wanted to know, is it possible to update my ListView in codeMainActivitycode class from different threads I tried passing my activity context in thread constructor and get instance of codeListViewcode like thisp  precodeListView lv  ListViewparentActivity.findViewByIdR.id.listViewInXml codepre  pThen I updated this codeListViewcode as per my requirement after the thread execution is complete.

Negative 15627 pIm on Ubuntu 14.04 and just installed the latest version of GVM 1.3.13. I then used it to install Grails 2.3.7, Groovy 2.2.2 and Gradle 1.11.p  pGroovy and Gradle seem to have installed perfectly fine I can execute their SDK commands, such as codegroovyccode, etc.. But whenever I execute emanyem Grails command, from emanyem directory, my entire terminals screen clears, pauses for a second, and then redraws my command line prompt. The command never gets executed. Several months ago, on Nabble, another user reported a hrefhttpgrails.1312388.n4.nabble.comGrails235onUbuntutd4653913.html relnofollowa very similar issuea.p  pFrom the shell, if I execute codeecho GRAILSHOMEcode, I getp  blockquote   phomemyuser.gvmgrailscurrentp blockquote  pIf I ececute codeecho PATHcode I do see that codehomemyuser.gvmgrailscurrentbincode is on my system path.p  pSo then I decided to dig deeper and actually go to codeGRAILSHOMEcode. Its a symbolic link actually pointing to codehomemyuser.gvmgrails2.3.7code. So when I go there, I see a normal Grails installation, including a codebincode directory. When I drop into that codebincode dir, I seep  precodegrailsdebug grails.bat grailsdebug.bat startGrails.bat startGrails grails codepre  pI open codegrailscode a shell script and seep  precodebinsh trap reset EXIT trap reset INT trap reset TERM  DIRNAMEdirname 0 .

Here was my outputp  precode1... 2...dirname is homezharvey.gvmgrailscurrentbin codepre  pThe last line of output em2...dirname is...em pauses for 2 seconds, and then my screen clears as if I had issued a codeclearcode command and my prompt reappears.

Negative 15627 pI recently decided to attempt a C solution to a recently ended topcoder.com competition, as a way to learn the language being new to C. However, I became stumped when iteration through a stdset object did not successfully reach all elements in the set set.count   elements traversed. Ive searched in vain for others who have experienced this here at StackExchange and elsewhere.p  pstrongThe Specificsstrongp  pI have posted the code to pastebin a hrefhttppastebin.comU7xQzDQg relnofollowhttppastebin.comU7xQzDQga .p  pWhat I am attempting to do is a naive clustering algorithm. Im sure there are better ways to achieve what I want to do but this does not interest me at this stage as my focus is on learning the language and its idiosyncrasies. I represent squares in a Cartesian grid by a Position object, with properties x and y. Using an iterative method, I scan the whole grid looking for objects of the same colour, grouping them into Cluster objects. When the algorithm is complete, there will be a set of Clusters, each of which includes a set of Position objects that are spaced by no more than a set distance. At some point during the algorithm, it is necessary to merge clusters that are close to one another which is where I start to have problems.p  pIf you compile and run the code posted on pastebin, you will see messages like the followingp  precodeTO MERGE Cluster of size 1 [1,1],  Cluster of size 2 [0,1], [0,2],  MERGED 0x7fffb5e9b970Cluster of size 3 [0,1], [1,1],  codepre  pWhat should be shown in the last line, if my code was working correctly, isp  precodeMERGED ltMemory Address of ClustergtCluster of size 3 [0,1], [1,1], [0,2], codepre  pThese lines are generated whenever a merge is attempted see line 54 with the string representation of the Cluster objects generated by an operator casting method see line 97 using standard set iteration.p  pWhat is clear is that though the set claims to have the right number of elements, iterating through the set does not reach all of them. I thought it might be a problem with objects passing out of scope, and being destructed but this does not appear to be the case, as stdset objects copy elements before inserting them into the data structure and tests with a destructor on the Position elements suggested otherwise.p  pIm really at a loss, and dont want to hack around it... because I think there is something significant that I am missing here. Can anyone help mep  pBest, Matthewp

Negative 15627 pI have this code working in chrome desktop. I tested it using simulate touch and it works as expected. My surprise came when I tried to watch it on my tablet, using chrome for Android. This is complex but it is supposed to create a touch pad for controling the camera. It captures the start and if you move the finger 50 pixels to any side you start moving towards it. When you stop touching the pad should desapear and the movement should stop. Meanwhile, when I do this on my tablet, it doesnt move at all, and what is more, when I stop touching, if I have moved the finger, the pad never hides... I dont know if this is problem of my code or if it is of the browser itself.p  pEDIT I tried firefox for android and it works. It must be something about chrome...

Negative 15627 pI have an RDLC report, I have a column chart whose X axis is shows PerformedBy person names,  Y axis shows the count of exams grouped by each PerformedBy person.  The data in the dataset contains case sensitive data.  For example, there are two PerformedBy names like john and JOHN.  john has Number of exams as 1 where as JOHN has 2. Currently in the chart it displays only JOHN.  The data for both john and JOHN are combined and shown under JOHN as 3.

Negative 15627 pI am using a windows 8 laptop. My old laptop had a key combo, fnf5, which would make the computer go to sleep. My new laptop has a power button on the side that acts like the one on your phone, it puts the PC to standbysleep. But i dont like hardware buttons because they wear out. I plugged in a logitech keyboard that has a dedicated key with the power button symbol and when you press it, it does the same thing. i did not install any software or drivers btw, just plugged it in My goal is to use autohotkey to assign a key combo to send the same keycode. There are bakedin some windows functions I dont know what to call them. Shell commands that are supposed to put the PC to sleep but they always put it into hibernation or shut it down, not what i want, which is why i am resorting to this. Does anyone know how to intercept keycodes or somethingp

Negative 15627 pIm looking to develop an application that necessitates multiple devices sending and receiving messages. These messages need not be acknowledged necessarily, they just need to be sent to all potential recipients in the area. Further complicating the issue, I cant have a centralized solution i.e. one where a fixed server relays data between clients. p  pIve looked into a bunch of technologies that should support this to no avail. BLE has a broadcast mode that should do the trick but as of Android 4.4.3 they have yet to support this feature. WiFi direct requires two peers to establish a connection. Same goes for classic Bluetooth. p  pIs there any technology that is supported by Android that communicates in this way Im running into a lot of trouble trying to create a solution that could function without this technology and I cannot.p
Negative 15627 pI have a uicollectionview using flow layout that has a supplementary header view which is a view that I only sometimes want to display. So basically I want to have a button that will, when clicked, remove the supplementary view from the collection view and also replace all the items in the collection view with the consideration that the header is gone. Is this possible Ive tried it repeatedly in many ways. Changing the reference header size, changing my answer to the delegate method for the header size, invalidating the layout, reloading the data etc etc etc. What am I missingp  pI just ran a test. I think that its related to using UIDynamics, what is it in UIDynamics that would override my delegate response for header section reference sizep

Negative 15627 pI am using Apples Sprite Kit to create a game, and currently I have drawn an codeSKShapeNodecode object that looks similar to the followingp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comQJiJH.png altenter image description herep  pMy actual sprite has rounded edges, but for simplicity, I am trying to get everything working with this shape first. I am able to draw the sprite perfectly fine. However, I am having trouble creating a physics body to cover the sprite. I want the sprite to recognize collisions anywhere along its surface, so I want a physics body that covers only the dark gray area. Also, I want the sprite to respond to forces and impulses, so I need a volumebased physics body.p  pMy first idea was to simply use the same codeCGPathRefcode that I used to create the image for the sprite, and pass it to the codebodyWithPolygonFromPathcode method to create a corresponding physics body. I have come to find this will not work, as my shape is not convex.p  pSo, now I am thinking I should be able to use codebodyWithBodiescode to create a physics body shaped appropriately. I want to create three rectangular physics bodies one to cover the left of the gray area, one to cover the top, and one to cover the right, and use those to create one physics body whose area covers the gray area of my sprite by using thisp  precode    mySprite.physicsbody  [SKPhysicsBody bodyWithBodies[body1, body2, body3]] codepre  pHowever, the main problem I am having is correctly positioning the individual bodies that go into the array, which is passed to the codebodyWithBodiescode method. By using the above method, I obviously have no way of controlling where these physics bodies are being placed in relation to each other. The result is all three physics bodies stacking on top of each other in the center of codemySpritecode. p  pHow exactly are you supposed to position the physics bodies in the array relative to each other before passing them to the codebodyWithBodiescode methodp

Negative 15627 pI realize this has been asked before, on this site and others, but none have provided a satisfactory answer. Im just starting out with CC and Im using the Eclipse CDT on Mac.

There is nothing wrong with the code, as far as I know.p  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt   int main      printfHello World  codepre  pIm pretty sure there is nothing wrong with the gcc configuration or anything, although I am not entirely certain.

Negative 15627 pI am in the process of moving my development environment to a new machine. I decided to install VS2013 Pro on my new machine VS2010 Pro on the old machine.  I copied the entire Visual Studio 2010 folder over to the Projects folder on the new machine.  I opened my solution in VS2013 and everything migrated without error.  I rebuilt the solution and got the following warnings.  I have compared my projects side by side on old and new machine and cant find any differences.  The only difference I have been able to find is that the old machine has folders for only .NET 4.0 and the new machine has .NET 4.0, 4.5 and 4.5.1. p  pWarnings 0,0 warning  The following assembly has dependencies on a version of the .NET Framework that is higher than the target and might not load correctly during runtime causing a failure Email, Version1.0.0.0, Cultureneutral, PublicKeyTokennull.

Negative 15627 pbasically I have an output from a DHCP server log that looks something like thisp  precode  hardware ethernet 001641ef9e47   clienthostname mo10   hardware ethernet 0011257320a5   clienthostname mo11   hardware ethernet 0011257320a5   clienthostname mo11   hardware ethernet 0011257320a5   clienthostname mo11   hardware ethernet 001641ef9e47   clienthostname mo10   hardware ethernet 001125732135   clienthostname mo23 codepre  pEach two lines come together  the first is the MAC address of a device on the network and the second is the hostname.

Additionaly there are many duplicate entries, which I would like to remove. I tried messing around with grep and awk, but Im not very proficient at manipulating text in bash and this is just too complex for me. I would be glad if somebody could provide a way to accomplish this and explain why it works.p  pThank you very much.p

Negative 15627 pI am working with a crystal report that has the first few pages populated with a few fields from the database and the rest of the report has sections of static information mostly legal terms and conditions. p  pNow the report runs fine but I am running into a lot of issues when I have to update the terms and conditions text every time theres a change. It may sound easy, but Crystal is extremely finicky when it comes to handling formatting copied over from a Word Document. This makes it extremely difficult to work with. p  pI am exhausted of ideas trying to make this work, but is there any way to keep that static text independent from the report Is there anyway to give control of the document to the users so they can change it at will and be stored on the network somewhere that gets called in and embedded onto the report p  pIt neednt be just a crystal report, it can be a SSRS report as well, it really doesnt matter.p  pTLDR Need help embedding contents of a document file in a CrystalSSRS report that can be sitting out on the network somewhere.p  pThanks for the help in advance p

Negative 15627 pMy project has an objective c class codeMockupModelcode that provides mockup information to an iOS XCode project to help with creating screen shots for the App store.p  pThe project has two targets. The mockup target includes codeMockupModel.mcode.p  pI want the main target for the actual App to strongnotstrong include codeMockupModel.mcode so that there is no chance of it accidentally being linked in to the shipping App.p  pHowever, when I exclude the codeMockupModel.mcode from the project using the files attribute inspector, reasonably enough, the project fails to link. I get an error complaining that the functions of codeMockupModelcode are missing.p  pIs there some way that I can declare codeMockupModelcode as optional so that the linker doesnt worry if it is not implemented At run time my code will check to see if its available with a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma30573372547229codeNSClassFromStringMockupModelcodea, or with a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma100680792547229code[MockupModel class]codea.p  pThanks.p

This is where my issues start.  strongOn the getuser.php page, I have 3 buttons  the codestartcode and codenextcode buttons, and the codesubmitcode button.  The codestartcode and codenextcode buttons send me back to the start as if I were to load test.php from scratch, and the codeupdatecode button WORKS, but it loads update.php without loading update.js,strong redirecting to update.php and processing it successfully, which is the whole thing Im trying to avoid by utilizing a multipage AJAX environment...  strongIf I load up getuser.phpqJohn20Doestrong by itself, these buttons all work exactly as I designed them.p  h2What Ive triedh2  pI put this code in the beginning of my update.js file, since I call it both in test.php and in getuser.phpp  precodedocument.readyfunction       div.cssborder, 3px solid red   console.logupdate.js loaded successfully   codepre  pjust to make sure my .js file is loading properly.p  pIf load the page normally, test.php, there is a small red border around the top header of my page  so update.js is being called, but its not being called on the getuser.php that loads after that as there are no little red borders around the divs on that page.  If I load getuser.php directly without going through test.php, the borders are there, and everything works fine.p  pI must have skipped over some section of learning when I started getting into this, because I have no idea what is going wrong, or some of my code only works when I load the page directly and not inside of another page.p

Negative 15627 pIm trying to fix C async code launching a cancelable operation performed in an external dll written in unmanaged C routine.p  pIs there a way to cancel a Task using a Cancellation Token passed to the Task at creation, if the user delegate calls an external non managed C routine p  pAs far I know, Task cancellation involves cooperation between the user delegate and the code that requested the cancellation. A successful cancellation involves the requesting code calling the CancellationTokenSource.Cancel method, and the user delegate terminating the operation in a timely manner either by simply returning from the delegate when he notices that the a cancellation request has been raised by polling the CancellationToken.IsCancellationRequested method or by throwing an OperationCanceledException using CancellationToken.ThrowIfCancellationRequested method. cf a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarydd99739628vvs.11029.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarydd99739628vvs.11029.aspxap  pThese two ways involve that the non managed C routine executed by the user delegate cooperates by receiving the CancellationToken as a parameter and by calling at regular intervals its IsCancellationRequested andor ThrowIfCancellationRequested methods.p  pIs that possible to do that from a non managed external C routine p  pIf not, is there a way to force the termination of the task executing the user delegate executing the non managed c routine when the cancellation is requested by the requesting code p  pHere is an example extract of the mixed C  CCli  Unmanaged C code Im trying to fix in order to be able to cancel the operation performed by the user delegate in the C unmanaged code part   p  pFrmDemo.csp  precodepublic class FrmDemo  Form      private CliClass mCliObject     private System.Threading.CancellationTokenSource mCts     private System.Threading.CancellationToken mCt      private void FrmDemoLoadobject sender, EventArgs e               Creating the external CliObject         this.mCliObject  new NSDemo.CliClass         ...

Negative 15627 pI am developing a solution for CRM 2013 Online. Here is what I am trying to dop  ol liCreate a CodeActivity Workflow. When triggered, the workflow will query data and create a custom excel spreadsheet.li liAttach the spreadsheet to the record.li ol  pI tried using ILMerge to merge an excel library with the workflow library, the workflow library will call methods in excel library to create a spreadsheet. Then, I registered the merged library to upload to CRM. Everything is OK, but when I trigger the workflow, I get an exception codeSystem.Security.SecurityException Microsoft Dynamics CRM has experienced an errorcode.

Negative 15627 pI have a native app if it helps, its a JAR that stores data. There is a GUI made out of HTML and JavaScript that simply runs in the browser. Right now, I can run this service behind a webserver and use it on the my local machine or server.p  pThe part I cant figure out though is how I could translate this system to a mobile app. I know I can load my GUI with webviews, but then how would it communicate with my service Some of my research into running a webserver on a mobile device seems to be that is isnt a good idea maybe thats wrong though. So, Im basically looking for a way for my HTMLJS code to AJAX in data from a service that is running on the device natively. Or, maybe I would have to give up the AJAX idea, but either way, I just need the data to be accessible to the HTMLJS.p

Negative 15627 pI have two tables one holds the most recent value of a position and the other is an archive that holds all other values. I like to build a query that selects the position value closest to the date passed in. The most recent date will always be in the Positions table and everything older will always be in the archive.  Right now there is a datediff that looks at whether the date in the uptodate table or the date archive table is closer and then chooses which one. Im looking for a simpler approach that possibly does this in the join. of the select As you can see below this query is not too nice. Trying to come up with a way to do it in the join.

Negative 15627 pI have a database that I created in SQLite Browser. It has so far 34 tables and I am also planning to use ORMLite to do database insert, delete etc.  My problem is, since I created the database offline, I will have to ship the database with the app. So I kept my database in the assets folder and then I tried to copy the database. Going through other stackoverflow posts made me to use a hrefhttpsgist.github.comdonaldlittlepie1271795 relnofollowthis codea. I call this class from my MainActivity so that whenever user is inside my app, I can check if my database is there or not. But things arent working as expected.

Negative 15627 pIve browsed around for a while but I believe I have a slightly more unique situation here. I have a simple navigation which is a ltulgt list, with each ltligt containing an anchor ltagt. The first ltligt contains an image which is the logo. p  pId like for each of the subsequent ltligt AND ltagt elements to expand to the height of the logo, whatever it may be I would like for the only static height in this solution to be defined on the logos image, if possible.  The elements should also be vertically centered.  When you hover on the ltagt tags, the background and cursor selection should cover the entire height. p  pIve tried using display flex and display tablecell, with verticalalign middle and a bunch of other things. Ive almost got it but there is some empty space above and below the ltagt tags.

Negative 15627 pI want to create a custom codeObservableCollectionltstringgtcode to use with MVVM in WPF. My actual goal is to extend the standard codeObservableCollectionltstringgtcode by two properties, which return the selected index and the selected item, as well as by a method that checks whether a given string is in the Collection. It currently looks like thisp  precodepublic class MyStringCollection  ObservableCollectionltstringgt      private int selectedIndex     private ObservableCollectionltstringgt strings      public MyStringCollection  base              selectedIndex  0         strings  new ObservableCollectionltstringgt            ltsummarygt      Index selected by the user      ltsummarygt     public int SelectedIndex              get  return selectedIndex          set  selectedIndex  value             ltsummarygt      Item selected by the user      ltsummarygt     public string Selected              get  return strings[SelectedIndex]             ltsummarygt      Check if MyStringCollection contains the specified string      ltsummarygt      ltparam namestrgtThe specified string to checkltparamgt      ltreturnsgtltreturnsgt     public bool Containsstring str              return strings.Anyc gt String.Comparestr, c  0               codepre  pEven though codeMyStringCollectioncode inherits from codeObservableCollectionltstringgtcode, the standard methods, such as codeAddcode, codeClearcode, etc., wont work. Of course, that is because I create a separate instance codestringscode each time I create an instance of MyStringCollection.p  pMy question is how to addclear elements tofrom my codeObservableCollectionltstringgtcode without adding those functions manuallyp
Negative 15627 pI have this problem to solve and I need a little bit of help.p  pSo we have this train with wagons. Each wagon has a value for strongvolumestrong, which mustnt be exceeded by the sum value of the cargoes in  wagon strongat all timestrong. Each cargo also has a value for strongvolumestrong. Wagons are linked in Doubly Linked List and so are the cargoes in each wagon. The task is to move cargoes from wagon to wagon so that in the end we have the least amount of filled wagons. p  pcondition You can only move a cargo to the wagon on the right or to the left.p  pCan this problem be linked to any known programming algorithm, because I really dont want a solution using permutations and going through all possible movesp  pThe task starts with you receiving an unknown train. The first step would be that you go trough Doubly Linked List of wagons so that you know the number of wagons and in each wagon you should go trough Doubly Linked List of cargoes so that you know whit what composition youre dealing with.  p

Negative 15627 pI have an Entity Framework 6 context exposed as WCF DataService by means of codeEntityFrameworkDataServiceltgtcode.

Negative 15627 pMy current code works at fading out the window and minimising it after. However when I try to then restore the window, its opacity is still equal to 0. When I went through debugging it, it does codethis.Opacity  1code however it doesnt actually set the opacity.

Here is my codep  precodeDoubleAnimation animFadeOut  new DoubleAnimation0, DurationTimeSpan.FromSeconds0.2 private void fadeOutMinimise              animFadeOut.Completed  animFadeOutCompleted         this.BeginAnimationUIElement.OpacityProperty, animFadeOut           private void animFadeOutCompletedobject sender, EventArgs e              this.WindowState  WindowState.Minimized         animFadeOut.BeginAnimationUIElement.OpacityProperty, null         this.Opacity  1      codepre  pIm just not sure how to make this work so that the user can minimise the window, it fades out and allows the user to then restore the window with 1 opacity.

I could put them all in a single spinner, but there are 40,000 of them if you put them in one spinner, so its best to use two so you have less overhead.p  pI am having a terrible time getting the code to extract the selected item from the spinner just one for now and display it in an existing textView.p  pHeres the NewSong.java codep  precodepackage com.edsets.gigmaster  import android.app.Activity import android.os.Bundle import android.support.v7.app.ActionBarActivity import android.view.Menu import android.view.MenuItem import android.view.View import android.widget.AdapterView import android.widget.AdapterView.OnItemSelectedListener import android.widget.ArrayAdapter import android.widget.Spinner import android.widget.TextView  Added the OnItemSelectedListener manually   public class NewSong extends ActionBarActivity       Override     protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState          super.onCreatesavedInstanceState         setContentViewR.layout.activitynewsong          Spinner spinner1  Spinner findViewByIdR.id.spinner1  Create an ArrayAdapter using the string array and a default spinner layout         ArrayAdapterltCharSequencegt adapter  ArrayAdapter.createFromResourcethis,                 R.array.PrimaryChords, android.R.layout.simplespinneritem  Specify the layout to use when the list of choices appears         adapter.setDropDownViewResourceandroid.R.layout.simplespinnerdropdownitem  Apply the adapter to the spinner         spinner1.setAdapteradapter         spinner1.setOnItemSelectedListenerOnItemSelectedListener this            public class SpinnerActivity extends Activity implements OnItemSelectedListener            public void onItemSelectedAdapterViewltgt parent, View view,                                    int pos, long id               An item was selected.

Negative 15627 pI am working on an application which gathers analytics data from various social platforms like Facebook, Twitter etc. The application pulls insights using apis and access tokens from social platforms. p  pNow, I want to integrate Pinterest insights into my application. For that, I need a business to grant access to my app. I visited a hrefhttpsdevelopers.pinterest.commanage relnofollowhttpsdevelopers.pinterest.commanagea and created my app. However, it did not ask me anything as explained in stackoverflow answer a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions24194892howtoobtainpinterestv3apikeyoraccesstokenHow to obtain Pinterest V3 APIKEY or accesstokena and hence, I could not get any access token.p  pBefore I am told this question is duplicate, all I want to know is how to use domain apis of Pinterest. I know there are few public Pinterest APIs which do not require any access token, however I want to access the domain APIs a hrefhttpsdevelopers.pinterest.comapidocsv3topclickshandler relnofollowhttpsdevelopers.pinterest.comapidocsv3topclickshandlera. There doesnt seem to be any detailed documentation for this I have gone through the links posted as answers to similar stackoverflow questions, however none seems to have domain apis info. p  pAlso, Pinterest analytics page a hrefhttpsanalytics.pinterest.com relnofollowhttpsanalytics.pinterest.coma shows different insights for your business account. Is there any way to grant an access of these insight to third party app via access token so that it can pull these data rather than me logging into analytics page and see the data the way Pinterest wants to show and not how I want to seep  pThanks.p

Any thoughts on how this could be achieved, and why isolating  the scope on the parent, makes it unavaiable to the child  p  pstrongEditstrong As Sean pointed out on gitter  p  pPer angular docsp  pThe transclude option changes the way scopes are nested. It makes it so that the contents of a transcluded directive have whatever scope is outside the directive, rather than whatever scope is on the inside. In doing so, it gives the contents access to the outside scope.p  pThis makes sense ok, but ... How can I isolate scope and use ngTransclude at the same time  p  pstrongEdit 2strong p  pJims suggestion worked really well in the plunkr.

Currently the scope is only shared between accordionbody and accordionheader. p

Negative 15627 pIm using StreamReader.ReadLine in C to read through a text file to find the specific content like Stepxx and then read and use the contents that point to the next occurrence of Stepxx1.

Negative 15627 pIve come across several discussions on using INDIRECT and 3D references, however none seem to address or fix this problem specifically.p  pIm trying to count the position of a worksheet without using VBA. Each sheet represents a month, and has a standardized name e.g. JAN15, FEB15, MAR15, etc.. My idea is to find the position by counting the number of sheets between JAN15 and the current sheet. A1 of each sheet  1, which gets summed across the sheets using a 3D reference.p  pUsing February as an example, I can hard code this with no problemp  pSUMJAN15FEB15A1p  pWhen I do this, I get the expected result of 2. However, I want each months sheet to dynamically generate its position without having to change the formula each time. So I tried thisp  pCell named FIRSTMONTH JAN15br Cell named CURRMONTH RIGHTCELLFILENAME,A1,6br N1 CONCATENATE,FIRSTMONTH,,CURRMONTH,A1br N1 evaluates correctly as JAN15FEB15A1p  pWhen I try this formula to generate the positionp  pSUMINDIRECTN1p  pI get a REF error. Ive also tried this variationp  pSUMINDIRECTN1p  pWhich returns 0.p  pAnyone have an idea of how I can get this to work Or is there a better way that doesnt use VBAp  pDavidp
Negative 15627 pI am writing a C program to read data from an SSD drive by reading directly from the raw block device file.p  pI am trying the Linux AIO I am talking about the Linux AIO API, i.e. the functions provided by codelinuxaio.hcode, such as codeiosubmit...code etc., not the POSIX AIO API. I open the block device file using the codeODIRECTcode flag and I make sure that I write to buffers are aligned to block size.p  pI noticed that Linux AIO it is considerably faster than using syncronous IO also with codeODIRECTcode flag.p  pThe thing that surprised me the most is that the throughput achieved by issuing many small random reads of few KBs each with Linux AIO is remarkably higher even than the throughput achieved doing a large sequential read of few MBs using synchronous IO and codeODIRECTcode.p  pSo, I would like to know how come Linux AIO peforms that better than syncronous IO What does the kernel do when AIO is used Does the kernel perform request reordering Does using Linux AIO result in greater CPU utilization than using synchronous IOp  pThanks a lot in advancep

Negative 15627 pI have a Thinkpad running Linux Ubuntu 14.04 which is on a wired network and a Mac running Yosemite on wireless, in a different subnet. Theyre both work machines. I also have a 1TB encrypted USB external Lenovo disk.

Negative 15627 pLets say that we split a problem of finding maximum value into n parts and each of n tasks has a variable emlocalmaxem which is used to find some kind of maximum value. The closer emlocalmaxem is to the actual maximum value the faster program finds the original maximum value, so there is benefit in keeping emlocalmaxem equal to the largest emlocalmaxem value across all tasks. What are some feasible ways to accomplish this  This is an example pseudocode of the algorithmp  precodewhileisWorkFinished   possibleMax  lookForMaxlocalmax   ifpossibleMax gt localmax     localmax  possibleMax     codepre  pObviously sending and receiving emlocalmaxem after each iteration would be a bad idea because most time would be wasted on communication, not calculation. I could do this synchronization every k iterations but how could this synchronization be implemented A perfect scenario would be if any task at any time could receive a current largest emglobalMaxem, if its lesser than emlocalMaxem then send emlocalMaxem to update emglobalMaxem in the master task. In codep  precodeMPIRecvampglobalMax, 1, MPIINT, 0, 0, MPICOMMWORLD, MPISTATUSIGNORE iflocalMax gt globalMax     MPISendamplocalMax, 1, MPIINT, 0, 0, MPICOMMWORLD  codepre  pBut I cant think of a way to make it work. Perhaps its because I am very new to MPI.p  pAnother idea is to use master task to send all values of emlocalMaxem and then broadcast the largest one I guess reduce function could be used in that case but is it a good idea If possible, I would like to not use barrier operationsno waiting until every task does something, because I predict that it will really slow down everything. p

Negative 15627 pI am quite new to Service Discovery and clustered systems. I started experimenting with Mesos and Marathon for the deployment of Docker containers, the Marathon REST API and UI seem to do a good job. p  pMy problem is the actual discovery of deployed services. For testing purposes I deployed a Kafka Cluster scaled to 3 instances via Marathon, as so I did with a MongoDB testcluster. The MesosDNS client gives me a record like codekafka.marathon.mesoscode and codemongo.marathon.mesoscode which implies the dynamically mapped port from the host to the container. The problem is, that my client explicitly needs information about the target port. Is there a general way to get those port information from the service automatically and dymanically What about apps exposing multiple portsp  pMy thougts so far   Doing a REST call to get a status about the deployed app and somehow extract the relevant data  Doing a DNS SRV lookup and somehow extract the relevant data  Having some kind of master, statically bound to a port, with dynamic clients.p  pI searched a lot for those informations but in the end most of the tutorials ended with a manual lookup which is not what I aim for. p

Negative 15627 pI have ubuntu 14.04TS. I use NodejskafkaStormmongoDB chain. With initial development, everything goes well. Messages are finally stored into mongoDB. p  pIn Kafka, I have one zookeeper and broker0 in kakfa1. broker 1 in kafka2. With storm, zookeeper,nimbus and drpc are located at storm1. supervisor and worker are located at storm2. p  pNow the questions is when I do update storm1 and storm2. I stopped all processes of storm1 and storm2. I suppose Kafka will buffer the message from Nodejs. After I restarted both storm1 and storm2, and redeployed topology, I found messages during storm1 storm2s, down and up, are lost. So indeed, kafka does not keep persistence of messages during storm maintenance period.p  pIn my mind, kafka will remember the last index of the message it receive acknowledgement. p  pIn all, how could I prevent message from lost when storm is under maintenance.     p

Negative 15627 pIm currently speeding up compilation of a large C project there is some C code too. Initially Imp  ul liremoving unnecessary system includes andli liintroducing precompiled headers for common system includes such as codestddef.hcode or codevectorcode. But not for includes like codestdio.hcode or codeiostreamcode which shouldnt be commonly used.li ul  pId thought that system headers would have include guards and thus would be covered by gccs a hrefhttpgcc.gnu.orgonlinedocscppinternalsGuardMacros.html relnofollowmultiple include optimizationa. However it seems that not all headers follow this guideline. For example codestdlib.hcode has codeifndef STDLIBHcode at the start, and codestddef.hcode follows the same pattern. But codeassert.hcode doesnt have a standard include guard, and nor does codecstddefcode or codecstdlibcode.p  pIve been using the codeHcode option in gcc to track and subsequently analyse include dependencies in this project. What Ive observed is that for a small subproject with only 6 files, codestdlib.hcode and codestddef.hcode, which follow the include guards pattern, show up 6 times in the output, whereas the files that dont can show up 10s or 100s of times. Im a little concerned that as some of these files may be on a remote network drive, compilation may be slower. p  pWhen I initially got precompiled headers working in the project, only including C headers such as codevectorcode, and headers from some internal libraries, I was a little surprised to only get a 20 performance increase. When Ive done similar in Visual C Ive seen greater increases. Possibly related a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13309228gccbuildtimedoesntbenefitmuchfromprecompiledheadersGCC build time doesn39t benefit much from precompiled headersa.p  pIm relatively new to gcc, so I may have missed something.

Negative 15627 pI want to generate a random variate codeetacode using an equation from the appendix of a hrefhttpdx.doi.org10.1002pds.1555 relnofollowSetoguchi, Schneeweiss, Brookhart, Glynn, and Cook 2008a, i.e.p  precodeeta lt 0.4A  0.3w[,1]  0.36w[,2]  0.73w[,3]  0.2w[,4]  0.71w[,8]  0.19w[,9]  0.26w[,10]  rnormn  n, mean  0, sd  .580 codepre  pThe addition of the random normal deviate at the end of the above is mine. strongBUTstrong, I want to be able to control to some extent the skewness and kurtosis of codeetacode. In the above, codewcode is a matrix of continuous covariates and codeAcode is a dichotomous treatment indicator variable, itself dependent on an overlapping set of covariates with that of codeetacode.p  pIm trying to do this by generating the codewcode from a joint distribution specified by a copula using the R package strongcopulastrong. Using the codenormalCopulacode or codetcopulacode functions, I can provide a covariance matrix for the codewcode, which is ideal because I want to specify a range of different covariate correlations including some that are 0 however, the joint distribution then is not enough skewed or kurtotic. For reference, I want to achieve two levels of nonnormality 1 skew  2, kurtosis  7, 2 skew  3, kurtosis  21. These dont need to be exact. strongcopulastrong provides methods for generating from Archimedian copulas, but from what I can tell you cant provide a covariance matrix with those.p  pSo, is there another way to use copulas to generate a set of nonnormal covariates with prespecified covariances that would be better for subsequently obtaining an codeetacode with skewness and kurtosis Or, if anyone has other ideas, would you recommend getting codeetacode in a different manner I am particularly attracted to the copula method but am willing to consider others. a hrefhttplink.springer.comarticle10.10072FBF02294317 relnofollowFleishman transformationa is one example, but I havent had very good luck with that in the past.p  pExample codep  precodelibrarycopula n lt 1e5 Sigma lt matrixc 1,  0,  0,  0, .2,  0, .5,  0,  0,  0,                    0,  1,  0,  0,  0, .5,  0,  0,  0,  0,                    0,  0,  1,  0,  0,  0,  0, .2,  0, .5,                    0,  0,  0,  1,  0,  0, .4,  0, .5,  0,                   .2,  0,  0,  0,  1,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,                    0, .5,  0,  0,  0,  1,  0,  0,  0,  0,                   .5,  0,  0, .4,  0,  0,  1,  0,  0,  0,                    0,  0, .2,  0,  0,  0,  0,  1,  0, .4,                    0,  0,  0, .5,  0,  0,  0,  0,  1,  0,                    0,  0, .5,  0,  0,  0,  0, .4,  0,  1 ,                 ncol  10, byrow  TRUE myCop.m lt normalCopulaparam  P2pSigma, dim  nrowSigma, dispstr  un myMvd.m lt mvdccopula  myCop.m, margins  repexp, times  nrowSigma,                 paramMargins  listlistrate  1, listrate  1, listrate  1, listrate  1, listrate  1,                                      listrate  1, listrate  1, listrate  1, listrate  1, listrate  1 set.seed456 w lt rMvdcn  n, mvdc  myMvd.m A lt 1  exp10.8w[,1]  0.25w[,2]  0.6w[,3]  0.4w[,4]  0.8w[,5]  0.5w[,6]  0.7w[,7]1 A lt ifelserunifn  n, min  0, max  1 lt A, yes  1, no  0 eta lt 0.4A  0.3w[,1]  0.36w[,2]  0.73w[,3]  0.2w[,4]  0.71w[,8]  0.19w[,9]  0.26w[,10]  rnormn  n, mean  0, sd  .580 codepre

Negative 15627 pSo Im writing a program that generates and then solves a maze. I have everything working except for this one little thing. The marker in the maze will get to the second to last step of completing the maze and then stop on and then move to a different direction. Ive been working on this for about 2 hours now, tracing my code and cant seem to locate where or why it goes wacky at the last move.p  pThe rules for the maze are that codeXcode are walls and CANT be moved through, codeOcode are possible areas that CAN be moved through, and the code.code is the starting point. The codecode are paths that I have already moved to. The marker can move in any ordinal or cardinal direction North, Northeast, etc.p  pI have two matrices, one called codematcode which is displayed to the user with codeXcodes and codeOcodes and codecodes. I also have another matrix called codevisitedcode which is the same size as codematcode and is kind of the behind the scenes matrix which keeps track of what coordinates I can or cant move to. It stores codeWcode for walls, codeYcode for coordinates Ive already visited, and codeNcode for coordinates I can visit. p  pThe way I solve the maze is by checking for possible moves starting from North and moving counterclockwise around the compass until I find a possible move. The marker cannot move to spot it has already moved. p  pIf I come across a split path with more than one possible move, I place the coordinates of that position in two stacks called codesplitxcode for row and codesplitycode for column so I can come back to it later. If I hit a dead end where every square is either a wall or already visited, I backtrack to the last coordinates in my split path stacks, close off the path I just moved to, and pop the top values of the stack.p  pI also have another stack called codevisitStackcode which stores every move I make as codeNcode for North, codeNEcode for Northeast, on and on. This lets me retrace my moves and go to the last split path I encountered. Here is the code and below it, some chosen output.

Negative 15627 pI have a relatively simple Spring Boot application that, by default, is secured over SSL on port 9443 using a selfsigned certificate, which works great for serving up APIs to, say, a mobile app. However, I would now like to develop an unsecured web application with its own frontend and serve up a subset of the content I allow over SSL.p  pThis is what Ive come up with so far, which enables port 8080 over HTTP in addition to port 9443, the latter Ive defined in application.propertiesp  precodeSpringBootApplication ComponentScan public class Application extends WebMvcConfigurerAdapter       public static void mainString[] args          SpringApplication.runApplication.class, args           Bean     public EmbeddedServletContainerFactory servletContainer          TomcatEmbeddedServletContainerFactory tomcat  new TomcatEmbeddedServletContainerFactory         tomcat.addAdditionalTomcatConnectorscreateWebsiteConnector         return tomcat           private Connector createWebsiteConnector          Connector connector  new ConnectorTomcatEmbeddedServletContainerFactory.DEFAULTPROTOCOL         connector.setPort8080         return connector       codepre  pI am now faced with the task of only exposing endpoints to the 8080 connection, and all of them to 9443. Obviously, the latter currently works by default, but right now 8080 can access everything 9443 can. Ideally, I would like to control access to certain request mappings defined in a shared controller that both connections have access to, i.e. something like thisp  precodeRequestMappingvalue  public, method  RequestMethod.GET public ListltStringgt getPublicInfo       ...   HTTPSOnly RequestMappingvalue  secured, method  RequestMethod.GET public ListltStringgt getSecuredInfo       ...  codepre  pI assume something like what I have above isnt actually possible, but does anyone know how I could achieve the same effectp  pThanks in advance for any helpp
