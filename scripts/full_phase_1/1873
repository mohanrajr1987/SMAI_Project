However, since SQL Server only caches   one execution plan per query, chances   are very high that in the first case   the query execution plan will utilize   a clustered index scan because of the   col1  1 parameter substitution.

Negative 1873 pWeve got a Crystal Report v8.5  yes I know its old, with contained subreports, that gives problems when attempting to run on Citrix by one of our customers.  This appears to be because the subreports retain a hardcoded reference to the location of the original Access database at design time.  The latter is, for example, located at Cxyzabc.  Unfortunately we cant fool it by simply copying a dummy Access file to this location, as the Citrix user effectively does not see a C drive  At least this is my understanding  it has proven very difficult to find out basic operating principles of the Citrix environment. Has anyone encountered this problem and found a solution Or found any sites giving basic guidance to Citrix environmentp  pThanksbr  Chris Lp

Negative 1873 pIm doing some research for a Maps project Ill be starting soon, and Im trying to evaluate which of the Map APIs will be bestsuited to this project.

My basic requirements are, in no particular orderp  ul liFree as in beer, not necessarily as in speech.li liWebbased Javascript, FlashFlex, Silverlight, etc. are all okay.li liLongrunning and stable the map needs to be able to live in a browser for daysweeksmonths without gradually consuming too much memory or other system resources.li liFast The map absolutely must be able to plot thousands of points upwards of 10k points with ease. Every few seconds I need to be able to update a small number of these say, changing their color.li ul  pOther things Id like to seep  ul liFlexible the Google Maps JS API is a good example of this. Basically this leads to lots of good things like numerous thirdparty pluginsextensions, and puts a lot of power in the devs hands.li liWelldocumented and supported again, the GMap JS API is a good example. If Im going to start working with a new, rich API, Im going to need to be able to find answers.li ul  pAs of now, Im inclined to use the Google Map Javascript API since I am familiar with it. However, the question of whether or not the Flash API might be able to handle many points more efficiently and gracefully prompted this SO question.p  pSo, what have you had good or bad experiences with Based on my criteria, which API would you recommend Im sure there are good ones out there that I just dont know about.p

Negative 1873 pIm trying to get the absolute screen pixel coordinates of the top left corner of a view. However, all methods I can find such as codegetLeftcode and codegetRightcode dont work as they all seem to be relative to the parent of the view, thus giving me code0code. What is the proper way to do thisp  pIf it helps, this is for a put the picture back in order game. I want the user to be able to draw a box to select multiple pieces. My assumption is that the easiest way to do that is to codegetRawXcode and codegetRawYcode from the codeMotionEventcode and then compare those values against the top left corner of the layout holding the pieces. Knowing the size of the pieces, I can then determine how many pieces have been selected. I realise I can use codegetXcode and codegetYcode on the codeMotionEventcode, but as that returns a relative position that makes determining which pieces were selected more difficult. Not impossible, I know, but it seems unnecessarily complicated.p  pThanksp  pEdit This is the code I used to try to get the size of the holding container, as per one of the questions. codeTableLayoutcode is the table which holds all the puzzle pieces.p  precodeTableLayout tableLayout  TableLayout findViewByIdR.id.tableLayout Log.dLOGTAG, Values   tableLayout.getTop  tableLayout.getLeft codepre  pEdit 2 Here is the code Ive tried, following more of the suggested answers.p  precodepublic int[] tableLayoutCorners  new int[2] ...

The image has been divided up into a array of ImageViews the cells[] array contained within a codeTableLayoutcode. Cells[0] is the top left codeImageViewcode, and I picked cells[4] as its somewhere in the middle and most definitely should not have coordinates of 0,0.p  pThe code shown above still gives me all 0s in the logs, which I really dont understand because the various puzzle pieces are correctly displayed. I tried public int for tableLayoutCorners and default visibility, both giving the same result.p  pI dont know if this is significant, but the codeImageViewcodes are originally not given a size. The size of the codeImageViewcodes is determined during the initialisation automatically by the View when I give it an image to display. Could this contribute to their values being 0, even though that logging code is after they have been given an image and have automatically resized themselves To potentially counter that, I added the code codetableLayout.requestLayoutcode as shown above, but that didnt help.p  pIm stumped... Thanks again to anyone who can help.p

The extra fields can be added and removed and work just fine to create new models. p  pThe problem is, one of the fields uses an Ajax.Autocompleter the code in the page when the partial is rendered looks like this p  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt lt[CDATA[ new Ajax.Autocompleter...various args... ]]gt ltscriptgt codepre  pThe autocompleter works fine if the partial is rendered to begin with eg, if the form starts out with one instance of the partial, or when editing existing nested models. However, it doesnt work in the dynamically added form fields.p  pI have tried using both insert and just setting the innerHTML of an empty div to insert the HTML partial. With insert, the Autocompleter code is evaluated and everything in the codeltscriptgtcode tag vanishes as I understand is expected, but the autocomplete does not work. With setting the innerHTML, the script appears exactly as it does in the prerendered partial, but the autocompleter still doesnt get invoked. p  pI suspect that this has something to do with how the evalScripts works, and Ive found a hrefhttpwww.prototypejs.orgapiajaxupdater relnofollowsome documentation on the subjecta, but Im having a hard time working out how to apply it to the Autocompleter declaration. p  pAny advice hugely appreciatedp  pstrongETAstrong adding the javascript used to add in the new sectionp  precode  function addsectionlink, nestedmodelname, content         get the right newid which should be in a div with class lastid at the bottom of         the nearest section       var lastid  parseIntlink.up.previous.lastid.innerHTML       var newid  lastid  1       var regexp  new RegExpnew  nestedmodelname, g       content  content.replaceregexp, newid         this is the line that actually inserts the content into the page       link.up.insertbefore content    codepre  pDebugging with firebug shows that the content is correct ie has the normallyworking autocomplete code in it before it is inserted.p

It is printed on an A4 landscape page and consists of three identical columns those are 3 copies of a support ticket.

But if it gets too lengthy, it should get truncated after the first N lines N will vary among fields, mostly 2.p  pWhat would be the quickest way of doing thisp  pI first thought of using HTML and a browser control, but that creates unwanted headersfooters on the page.

Negative 1873 pI am new to JSF 2.0 and Primefaces but have decided to create my application using them seeing the primefaces showcase.p  pI have completed my application but have noticed that it is extremely slow. I have placed some system.out.println in various places to see what is being called and I noticed that sometimes methods in my controller such as methods that call my DAO to retrieve values from the Database are being called up to 6 times on one event My pages have a lot of datatables in them so sometimes multiple datatables  6 calls for each list being populated in each table seems like this is what is causing the slowness. p  pI am not sure what I have done wrong or if I did anything wrong but in my controller for instance I have a method that might look like this,p  precodepublic ListltAddressesgt getAddresses       ListltAddressesgt addr  systemDao.getAddressesuserBean.userId      return addr  codepre  pin the view I will then call this method like on a datatable element to display the result. p  pWhen I first load it it will only call this once but when I click maybe a button to open a dialog with completely unrelated data this getAddresses might be called 3  6 times and it has nothing to do with the data the I am requesting during the current action. Is anyone familiar with this and how I could maybe speed up my applicationp
Negative 1873 pSo currently in our code, we have a bunch of classes around accessing roles and permissions for specific users logged into the web application. This is built fine, and works well. However, a certain requirement that has come up now is not only the ability to restrict certain pages whole views to certain permissions, but also specific fields on those views. So you might have the ability to see a view, but you might only have a permission that lets you see certain fields on that page.p  pWe generate most of our fields using HTML Helpers with in ASP.NETC. For example here is one that we need to blockshow depending on a permissionp  precodelt Html.CheckBoxForm gt m.Current, new  class  economicTextBox, propertyName  Current, onchange  UseCurrentUpdateFieldthis gt codepre  pMy first thought was just to play the check for permissions in similar embedded C code right before that and put the HTML Helper in an if statement, so it would only render if the user had the permission. I second guessed myself when I saw the front end getting very bloated with all of these statements in my mind, and thought there might be a better way to do it.p  pCan any of you guys recommend anything Thanks.p

Negative 1873 pIm building a custom swing component more as a practical thought experiment than anything else.p  pIm having problems with repainting. My component has a codejtreecode, a codejtablecode, and then a part that is totally custom painted hopefully ending up to be quite MS projectesque ganttviewp  pThe specific problem is that when the jtree expands, the table and the gannt view should update to reflect the new sub projects under the newly expanded treenode. They do this, but the size doesnt update, so the table doesnt show the additional rows, and my gannt display doesnt use up the full height either. p  pthe odd thing is that if I touch the window handle on the codejframecode so even a 1px resize  this seems to force a complete refresh and the component then displays properly, both the table in the middle and the gannt on the right fill up the display. p  pIf I dont do a resize, then repaint is called when the nodes in the tree are expandedcollapsed, as I see the ganttview update, but it doesnt seem to expand to take up the full height of the screen.p  pI have put in a screenshot below which shows at the top the correct display after a resize, and the lower half, which is what I see if I expand a node without doing a resize. p  pMy assertion is that the component knows how to to repaint itself correctly, as it does the right thing on resize, but this must be  triggering a special event that forces a fuller refresh. I have tried various combinations of codeupdatecode, codeinvalidatecode, coderepaintcode, but I cant seem to emulate the full coderepaintcode that happens when the parent form is resized.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com6F0s7.jpg altScreenshotp  pThanks, Acep

Negative 1873 pI am working on an application that started out as a WinForm but it is now utilizing WPF windows with UI. The interaction is all working beautifully but when the WPF windows are first shown it takes quite a long time around 13 seconds for them to show. So long that some wonder if the app has crashed until the content shows. The second time the same windows are invoked they come up quickly. I need them to come up quickly the first time around.p  pI am making use of styles and control templates that are located as XAML in the resource folder. In the XAML for the WPF windows I then merge them into the windows resource dictionary. The Build Action for those in VS 2010 needs to be set to Resource. Preferably I want to keep them in separate files for easy maintenance.  As far as I understand if the build action was Page the XAML would be precompiled and should load faster but if I set it to Page I cannot merge them into the resource dictionary. Is there a way around thatp  pI am fairly new to this part of WPF and so far my internet search hasnt been successful. p  pTo be clear I am not talking about WPF controls being embedded in WinForms. I am talking about entirely separate WPF windows that are spawned from the WinForm context.p  pIs there a way to precompile the entire app or at least all XAML its all static, no dynamic XAMLp  pThanks in advancep  pEdit The UIs are not heavy by any means.

Negative 1873 pIn IMAP, message numbering is based on when a message is placed into a folder i.e. first message in the folder is 1, second message in is 2, etc.. However, this ordering has no regard for a messages received date. What Im concerned about are messages older than message number 1 of the folder, i.e. a message thats been moved into a folder by a user manually and not by when it was received into the system. p  pI cannot just get every messages receivedDate, as this is horrendoulsy inefficent.p  pI emthoughtem I could do a JavaMail search to get all messages with a received date emolderem than the first messages received date, and likewise then do a search to get all message with a recieved date emnewerem than the first messages received date... which would be many, but while I need to process ALL of the older ones, I only need to process a few of the newer ones, and by process, I mean download its headers.p  pHowever, when I am using the search, it just doesnt seem to work right.p  precode        Message[] messages  csqFolder.getMessages                     if messages  null ampamp messages.length gt 0               Date receivedDate  messages[0].getReceivedDate             log.traceMessage 1 receivedDate lt  receivedDate.toString  gt             SearchTerm msgsOlderThanOETFirst                   new ReceivedDateTermDateTerm.LT, receivedDate              SearchTerm msgsNewerThanFirst                   new ReceivedDateTermDateTerm.GT, receivedDate              Message[] oldMsgs  csqFolder.searchmsgsOlderThanOETFirst, messages             log.traceSize of oldMsgs lt  oldMsgs.length  gt             Message[] newMsgs  csqFolder.searchmsgsNewerThanFirst, messages             log.traceSize of newMsgs lt  newMsgs.length  gt codepre  pHowever, when I run these searches, it does not seem to give the correct results.p  pOn a folder with 8 messages, 7 of which have a received date time of around 1200 pm on Aug 5, but the first message in the folder which is at 400 pm on Aug 5, we will see the followingp  precodeMessage 1 receivedDate ltFri Aug 05 164657 CDT 2011gt Size of oldMsgs lt0gt Size of newMsgs lt7gt codepre  pHowever, ALL of the remaining seven messages are older than the first message... they should ALL be in oldMsgs.p  pThat said, IF I put a message from the previous day Aug 4 in that folder, then the search will coreectly work... for that ONE message.

However, If we take a given message at 852011 120000, we get the followingp  precode    SearchTerm msgsOlderThanOETFirst     852011 120000  lt 852011 164600             new ReceivedDateTermDateTerm.LT, receivedDate gt TRUE     SearchTerm msgsNewerThanFirst        842011 120000  gt 852011 164600             new ReceivedDateTermDateTerm.GT, receivedDate gt FALSE codepre  pExcept, no  we dont get that  instead, we get the reverse..... its easy to think yourself in circles at this point, but...

Negative 1873 pJust a really quick question about something small. The following is part of a programming assignment for my programming 2 class. It focuses on inheritance and multiple classes. Ive answered the question but want to consolidate the classes into a main function and actually build something rather than just submitting the bare minimum.p  pMy question is the section of code below. The user runs the program, is presented with a dialog asking him as to what hes like to add a CD or a Movie, theyre both separate classes.p  pWhat I would like though, is for the user to actually name the specific instance of the class while the program is running. So, the user will click Movie for example, be prompt to enter a name and then next line to use the constructor in the movie class to create a new instance class with the name the user entered Is this possible I tried using a simple string x  JOptionpane and then naming the class x also, but it didnt work.

When some other process want to draw something on this process, can lock the contents of this DIB and draw on this bitmap. If some other process want to read the contents of this bitmap, can lock the bitmap and read the bitmap. p  pPlease suggest a best way both in time complexity and space complexity manner. Space complexity means, a process which wants to draw contents on this bitmap should not need to copy all contents on local memory and draw, it should directly be able to take this bitmap in device context and draw in the bitmap. p

Negative 1873 pBasically Im trying to build a WIX msi that can run devcon.exe command line version of windows hardware manager to detect if a particular piece of hardware is installed. If it is, then install msi A, else install msi B A and B already exist as separate msi packages, we need automatic selective installation based on the hardware.p  pCurrently Ive installed the WIX SDK and have created a WIX project that correctly builds an msi. I can do simple things like execute CustomActions to open notepad.exe, that kind of simple things.p  p1st problem Im having trouble finding out how to package a file into the installer that isnt going to be installed into a directory. Ive found references to it, but nowhere that explicitly states how to do it. I dont have to put it inside Directory tags, if its not going to be installed onto the host drive, rightp  p2nd problem devcon.exe doesnt from what I can tell, correct me if Im wrong seem to change its return value depending on what it finds, probably because it does so many things and isnt restricted to whether a hardware device exists or not. So if I can get it embedded and get it to run, then I need to somehow take what it outputs to the standard output stream, and then parse it for the particular values that Im looking for.p  pOf course it would be a bit easier because Ive already got a batch file that can do the parsing and set an environment variable which will tell me what I need to know, but, if I can embed them both, how do I get the batch file to reference the embedded devcon.exe, and then get WIX to read the variable, or perhaps I can set one up or a property in WIX and then set it from the batch filep  pMaybe I should create a dll custom action instead Is it possible to run an embedded executable from a dll custom action Then I could run devcon.exe, and do all the parsing in there, then simply set a Wix variable or Property to choose what to do next.p  p3rd problem being able to run one msi from another. Im not quite upto this yet, but Ive found httpsoftwareinstall.blogspot.com200806funwithmsiembeddedchainer.html which looks promising, although I havent read through it all yet. One problem at a time, Ive certainly got enough already p

The rope itself is an array of sprites unless thats a bad idea. So far I can draw the line etc, and I have a clue about moving the start location but I do not know how I would Move the starting location without moving the entire line of sprites Moving the line of sprites in such a way to follow a curve Retract the line of sprites, although I imagine it would be the reverse process for moving it forward and so not too difficult if I can understand how to do the first part.p  pSo far I know about bezier curves, vrope and have googled every search term I could think of but still dont quite know what to do.

Is it correct, that the onProgressChangedmethod just gets notified for the first touch on the seekbar and on the last touch on the seekbarp  pIm trying to refresh a TextView that should show the current progress of the SeekBar. But the TextView is just updated on first touch and last touch. Debugging this confirms my assumption, the method is just called twice  What I would like to have is that the TextView shows every progress change in the SeekBar.p  pIn short I am searching for a possiblity to get a progress listener that is called for every litte progress change.p  pThank you for helping mep  pTimp
Negative 1873 pIm studying gridFS and I have a few questions.p  p1 gridFS automatically indexing files by generated id. But most of the time I get files by their filename, so should I create index on filename by myselfp  p2 gridFS dont have folders, just filenames, but I can mimic folders by using filenames with slashes imagesavatars35.jpg, rightp  p3 If Im indexing on filename  is it better in performance terms to use short filenames I mean  if I use users id which is 24 symbols long  suffixes, for example codeimagesavatar4f1d36b58e42ba3836ed178et.jpgcode, wouldnt indexing on such long field slow down my system Would it be better faster to use short users login instead of idp
Negative 1873 pI have a Grid, which I am trying to Edit in Pop Up mode. The pop up opens fine. I have placed two more grids within the pop up window. I load them through javascript ajax calls. These 2 grids on pop up also get populated just fine. Once I click on the submit for the pop up window which is the default checkmark icon, I get this Jscript error data.CancelledAMA.AgreementID is null or not an objectp  pWhere CancelledAMA is a custom object in my model ReplacementCombo that I bind to the original grid not the 2 grids within the pop up window. And AgreementId is an int within the CancelledAMA objectp  pI have tried the .DefaultDataItemnew ReplacementCombo in the original grid so that the model object gets populated with default values and created a constructor object too in the ReplacementCombo model class. But nothing works.p

Negative 1873 pI am in the process of creating some forms that I use every day at work, in excel. On the first form I am doing a VBA lookup from an external database and depending on the selected item the user chooses from the drop down list, it populates the required information on the cell containing the VBA look up formula. This is all working great but one thing that we are required to do when ordering with the form is, we have to track those purchases on another form. I created the second form as well and it populates all the information from the order form to their corresponding cells on the tracking form. The issue I am having is when information is changed in the referenced cells of the order form the information is changed on the tracking form replacing the 1st orders information with the next orders information. What I have been researching to no avail is, how to keep the previous orders information on the tracking sheet even though the order form is cleared to imput another order. When imputting the second orders information instead of erasing the previous orders information on the tracking sheet I want the information being imputed on the order form for the second order to  start on the next available colum in their corresponding cell references. p  pThat is one problem the other one is this. The order tracking forms have a set amount of columns of that information can be put in before it get to the bottom of the form. How do I get it to start another tracking form and continue tracking orders on its first available column and once again when getting to the bottom start another formp  pI know this was a lot of information and I hope I explained it well enough for you to understand. I was recently brought around to the use of macros but I am still a NOOB when it comes to these.

You might get the results you expect, but this is not guaranteed. The order of evaluation for expressions involving user variables is undefined and may change based on the elements contained within a given statement in addition, this order is not guaranteed to be the same between releases of the MySQL Server. In SELECT a, aa1, ..., you might think that MySQL will evaluate a first and then do an assignment second. However, changing the statement for example, by adding a GROUP BY, HAVING, or ORDER BY clause may cause MySQL to select an execution plan with a different order of evaluation. p blockquote  pMy goal is to avoid copyingandpasting those very complicated formulas because it hinders readability and if the formula every changes, I need to ensure that it is changed in all places  BUT I do know by doing so, itll work just fine.p  pAdditionally, I know that ALIAS emdoesntem work because aliases only work in GROUP BY, HAVING and ORDER clauses.p  pI read in some other posts to do a subquery first to calculate tax1 and owe first, then use another query to combine the results.

Negative 1873 pIm looking once again for help from the collective.  I created a site which when viewed in IE scrolls choppy but is smooth and fine in all other browsers.  I checked on two different laptops to be sure it wasnt just my video card.  p  pI also removed all the images to see if it was an image display issue and that didnt fix the problem.  Does anyone have any ideasp  pUPDATE  Based on the feedback Ive also tried the page with the images, boxshadows, and google fonts removed and I still get the choppy scroll.  Ive also now just removed the nav and side banner...ugh still no good.p  pemFOUND ITem  Ok so after essentially deconstructing my website piece by css piece I found that the cause of the choppy screen was due mostly to the use of the borderradius attribute thanks for pointing me in that direction. my page has two container divs that I applied the following css to     mozborderradius 10px     webkitborderradius 10px     borderradius 10pxp  pOnce I removed these the page was 90 smoother. I still get some choppy scrolling due to the header image it looks like but its much better.p  pThe final solution was to 1. Added conditional IE specifically to disable the borderradius when viewed through IE browser 2. To remove the last bit of choppyness  I took all the images I was using, created a sprite for them in photoshop and then used yahoo SmushIt to compress that file.  The site now loads great.p  pThanks for the input allp  pMy url is a hrefhttpmonopolydealrules.com relnofollowhttpmonopolydealrules.comap  pThanksp
Negative 1873 pI have a problem with the memory consumption of my app I hope you can help me with this, I have a Navigation Controller with maybe 10 controllers to navigate forward or backward, Im using  Instruments to check for the memory allocations also used the mtouch profiler, when I navigate forward 1st time obviously the memory consumed by the app increases .. but when i click on the standard back button of the nav controller the memory stills being the same amount and worst of all if I go forward again the memory increases more i.e. homeVC 10mb, VC1  10.5mb, back to homeVC  10.5 mb, forward to VC1  11mb, yes the memory is increasing while I still navigating through the VCs. In this scenario I have the following questionsp  ul liWhat is the behavior of the app on the standard Back button of the nav controller it executes a PopViewControllerAnimated.li liPopViewControllerAnimated and the other Pop methods of the navController should release the memory consumed by the dissapearing VCli liIf the Pop methods of the navcontrollers dont release the memory of the app, when I should dispose my disappearing VCs to avoid consuming so much memory I want to know the best work of manage the memory in the mono touch apps, maybe use the DidReceiveMemoryWarning method or there are another places when i can manage the release of the memory of my app.li ul  pThanks in advance for all your help.p

Negative 1873 pI have a png file created with python PIL that contains an height map positive values.p  pThe format is  single channel grey level at 16bit, thus 16 bit per pixel.p  pI read the file on android with codeBitmapFactory.decodeStreamlt...data input stream...gtcodep  pI correctly get the size of the image through codegetWidthcode and codegetHeightcode.p  pHowever when I loop though the pixels calling the codegetPixeli,jcode I obtain negative values, something like  16776192 16250872 16250872 16250872 16250872 16249848 ....p  pInstead I expect a positive value between 0 and 65535.p  pI discover that the value 16250872 in binary is 1111111111111111111111111111111111111111000010000000100000001000p  pThis shows that the information relies on the first 16 least significant bits.p  pI tryed with codegetPixeli,jamp0xffffcode and I obtain a plausible values, however Im not sure about the endianess should I to flip the 2 extracted bytesp  pIs there a way to do it in more elegant and portable way this conversion p  pNOTE the file is not a color RGBA PNG but a grey level PNG image with a single 16 bit value for each pixel.p
Negative 1873 pp As a student, I have created a website where I host experiments. This experiments are nothing but source codes in java or c. For example, If we have to develop a code for printing first 10 numbers then I will host a file named say numbers.java containing following codep  precodeimport java.io. class numbers    public static void main String args[]        int i     fori1ilt10i            system.out.printlni          codepre  pThis is just an example. I host such files and people do refer them while performing practicals. pBut as a developer, I want to create playground similar to Googles playground. On this playground peoples can execute this codes online in web browser itself. p I know such codes can be executed with applets, or even can be rewritten in php for execution but still I dont want rewriting work I want to execte them as it is on web broswer. That simply means I want to run strong.javastrong file in web browser. p So it is possible to run the java codes like on which is shown above in web browser. If it is possible then please suggest me the changes which I should make in above code. p Thanks in advance.p

Negative 1873 pMy question relates to layering in a solution I am currently working on. I get the feeling that the path Im on is breaking the layer separation and would like some feedback on that.p  pMy current project is a ASP.NET MVC4 app, that uses autofac, EF 5.0 Code First.p  pI have the following layers Domain, Data, Services and Presentationp  pThe data layer uses a repository which returns results from the DB via EntityFramework. This repository returns an IQueryablelt object as the set of retrieved results. This is because DbSetlt of EF is derived from IQueryablelt.p  precodepublic interface IRepositoryltTgt where T  BaseEntity      T GetByIdobject id     void InsertT entity     void UpdateT entity     void DeleteT entity     IQueryableltTgt Entities  get   codepre  pThe Services layer makes use of the said repository and thus operates on IQueryablelt objects. By default, Ive implemented my Service methods to return IEnumerbalelt objects for data retreival, thus my presentation layer should always receive a IEnumerablelt collection from the service.p  pHopefully the context is clear enough. This is my problemp  pI have the following two domain classesp  precodepublic class Video              public virtual string Title  get set          public virtual VideoCategory VideoCategory  get set          public int VideoCategoryId  get set       public class VideoCategory              public string Title  get set          public string Description  get set          public ListltVideogt Videos  get set          public VideoCategory                      Videos  new ListltVideogt               codepre  pAlso, I have the following VideoCategoryModel class defined in my presentation layer, which i need for binding in the uip  precodepublic class VideoCategoryModel              public string Title  get set          public string Description  get set          public int VideoCount  get set       codepre  pAs you can see, I would like to get a collection of objects representing video categories with a count of each categorys videos. Of course, I want to do this without fetching all the Video objects. In order to accomplish this, the service method returns a IQueryablelt VideoCategory  to my presentation such that I can query it like this in my controller    p  precode    var convertedResults  from videoCategory in service.GetVideoCategories                              select new VideoCategoryModel                                                            Title  videoCategory.Title,                               Description  videoCategory.Description,                               VideoCount  videoCategory.Videos.Count                              codepre  pThis query will be nicely interpreted by EF which will run a nice, fast Select query on the DB, with a count instead of fetching all Video objects. This is the GetVideoCategories implementationp  precodepublic IQueryablelt VideoCategory gt GetVideoCategories                      return videoCategoryRepository.Entities          codepre  pI would like to know if Im breaking my separation of concerns and layering by returning a  IQueryablelt VideoCategory  actually the EF DbSet directly to my controller, instead of returning a Listlt of objects.p  pAlso, after calling the ToList method on the IQueryablelt object it will be impossible to get the Count EF so nicely translates into SQL, so again I cannot return a Listlt VideoCategory  from the service.p  pSo to summarize the question. Is returning the EFDbSet directly to the controller a good idea  Am I breaking the layer separation  What are my alternatives if so.p  pThank you.p

Negative 1873 pWhile designing a RESTful API we came across the problem of how to access different versions of the same object.

Let us assume that an older version of the document is version 1. There seem to be at least two ways to design the API to access this particular version of the pagep  ol liGET apipagepagekey1li liGET apipagepagekeyversion1li ol  pThe first variant renders the particular version as its own resource the second variant gives the existing resource an optional version context.p  ul liIs variant 1 or 2 a better solution Or is there an even better way to do itli liIn variant 1 a request for a version number that does not exist e.g. apipagepagekey7 could trigger a HTTP 404 Not Found, which is quit handy.

Negative 1873 pIm currently learning CakePHP. I use CakePHP 2.2.3. I have succesfully installed a user management plugin. This plugin has a model class User and uses table users. Now, Id like to extend this User model in order to e.g. relate my own models to it, e.g. Posts.p  pI managed to to this with the following codep  p  precodeAppimportModel, Usermgmt.User  class MyUser extends User      var hasMany  arrayPost     var useTable  users  codepre  pThis works.p  pHowever, I dont like the fact that I have to call my Model class something like MyUser. It makes everything very ugly and, maybe  theoretically  sometime I want to install another plugin that uses classname MyUser. Is it somehow possible to use clean class names and prevent possible name collisions in the future..p

Negative 1873 pIn a hrefhttprads.stackoverflow.comamznclick0072465638 relnofollowthis booka Im currently reading while following a course on databases, the following example of an illegal query using an aggregate operator is givenp  blockquote   pemFind the name and age of the oldest sailor.emp      pConsider the following attempt to answer this queryp  precodeSELECT S.sname, MAXS.age FROM Sailors S codepre      pThe intent is for this query to return not only the maximum age but   also the name of the sailors having that age.

Negative 1873 pSome background for this question is my previous question  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13129372nonmemberfunctionpointerasacallbackinapitomemberfunctionnonmember function pointer as a callback in API to member functiona it may well be irrelevant.p  pThe callback launches a thread that writes some data.

Negative 1873 pIve done a fair amount of searching and have not been able to find a solution or an answer to this.  I have a test app Ive written to show the problem.  Im open to the idea that this is just the way WCF works and theres nothing I can do about it.  p  pMy test app is a simple WCF service and client with a Visual Studio generated proxy.  I point the proxy at a remote machine that is up, but not running the service.  That point is important.  If the remote machine is not running at all, the WCF call fails right away.  p  pThe client app creates an instance of the client proxy class, kicks off a new Task and then attempts to make a call on the service interface, which will block because the service at the other end isnt there.  The background Task sleeps for 5 seconds and then closes the proxy.  I was expecting the other thread to immediately fault when closing the proxy, but it doesnt.  After about 20 seconds from making the initial call, it then faults.  p  pHere is my client codep  precodeusing System using System.ServiceModel using System.Threading using System.Threading.Tasks using TestConsoleClient.MyTestServiceReference  namespace TestConsoleClient  class Program      static void Mainstring[] args              MyTestServiceClient client  new MyTestServiceClient           Start new thread and wait a little bit before trying to close connection.

Negative 1873 pI am trying to create a registration code for my C 2.0 desktop application, which is a payperuse application.  The registration code must hide an int value within it the int value represents the number of uses for the application.p  pTo generate the code from my machine, I have a separate application that uses Name, Random Number and the  of uses as the inputs.  For examplep  precodeName  BOBSMITH   Random number  51728   Number of Uses 50   Concatenated String BOBSMITH5172850 codepre  pIf I do a hash on the Concatenated String for example an MD5 hash I get a 32 hex string Ill call it the Reg Code similar to codeABCD 1234 EFGH 5678 IJKL 9012 MNOP 3456codep  pNow, on my users side of things, when they are registering the application, I need to verify the Reg Code AND determine the  of uses from the Reg CodeNameRandom Number.  So the user will enter these valuesp  precodeName BOBSMITH   Random Number 51728   Reg Code ABCD 1234 EFGH 5678 IJKL 9012 MNOP 3456  codepre  pstrongMy questionstrong How can my application determine based only on the Name, Random Number and Reg Codep  ul liThat the registration Code is correctli liThe  of uses that were initally given from my machine li ul  hr  pOne simple idea I have thought of is to generate a Hash based on only the Name and Random Number lets call it code A and then add the  of uses to this hash code B.  For examplep  precodeCode A ABCD 1234 EFGH 5678 IJKL 9012 MNOP 1184   Code B ABCD 1234 EFGH 5678 IJKL 9012 MNOP 11B6 codepre  pIf we subtract Code A from Code B, we get 50.

I would then subtract the Code A from the Reg Code that the user entered and see that the difference is 50.  Hence, I would know to give the user 50 uses.  This solution seems too insecure, however.  I would appreciate anyones suggestions.p

Negative 1873 pDoes anyone have a list of the HTML HTML5 elements that are strongnotstrong tabbable, even if a tabindex is specified By tabbable, I mean that they can receive the focus through repeatedly pressing the tab key.p  pWe know that there are those elements which are tabbable by default, such as codeinputcode or codetextareacode. We also know that there are some elements which are only tabbable if a tabindex is explicitly specified, such as codedivcode and codespancode elements.p  pAccording to W3Schools, In HTML5, the tabindex attribute can be used on any HTML element. However, there are surely some elements which are not tabbable even if they have a tabindex. For example, it makes no sense for the codeparamcode element to be tabbable, or the codeheadcode element. I also dont really think its possible for the codeoptioncode element to be tabbable, but Im not sure about that. And Im even less sure about things like codemapcode which can contain tabbable elements but are not usually tabbable themselves.p  pCan someone give me a list of all the elements that can never receive focus even if they have a tabindexp

Negative 1873 pWe have set of images in a shared path. In the query we have written a logic that would give us the path of the image something like strongpathLogos test.jpgstrong . In the RTF template, we have used a dummy image with the strongAlt Textstrong set to the path of the image like strongurlPATHFIELDstrong. In the run time, instead of dummy image, the image we need comes up. This only works if the output is in HTML. We need the output to be in PDF. For PDF outputs, the image is not getting displayed. It just shows a white blank space. Any help would be deeply appreciated.p

Negative 1873 pIm building a MVC4 app, Ive used EF5 model first, and kept it pretty simple. This isnt going to a huge application, there will only ever be 4 or 5 people on it at once and all users will be authenticated before being able to access any part of the application, its very simply a place order  dispatcher sees order  dispatcher compeletes order sort of application. p  pBasically my question is do I need to be worrying about repositories and ViewModels if the size and scope of my application is so small. Any view that is strongly typed to a domain entity is using all of the properties within that entity. Im using TryOrUpdateModel in my controllers and have read some things saying this can cause a lot of problems, but not a lot of information on exactly what those problems can be. I dont want to use an incredibly complicated pattern for a very simple app. p  pHopefully Ive given enough detail, if anyone wants to see my code just ask, Im really at a roadblock here though, and could really use some advice from the community. Thanks so muchp

Negative 1873 pIm currently using a pseudo object structure in my javascript.

This makes the code both messy and complex. The complexity IMHO is that Im forced to maintain two separate places when I introduce new attributes. This concerns me as Im aware how this can be a cause of introduced defects.p  pSo my question is thus, is there a javascript mechanism that I can use to apply the attributes of an object to my instance of MyObj Im not happy with my approach and Im finding it difficult to search for questions on this subject suspect this is due to my lack of knowledge on the correct javascript terms for these entities. p  pBtw, the obj is created from parsing JSON data. p

For example...p  precodemasterArray  array       [0]gtarrayidgt123, urlgthttpxyz.com, datagtsomething, data2gtelse,      [1]gtarrayidgt123, urlgthttpxyz.com, datagtsomething, data3gtbaby,      [2]gtarrayidgt456, urlgthttpabc.com, datagtsomething, data2gtcompletely,      [3]gtarrayidgt456, urlgthttpabc.com, datagtsomething, data3gtdifferent,      [4]gtarrayidgt789, urlgthttpdef.com, datagtsomething, data2gtis not quite,      [5]gtarrayidgt789, urlgthttpdef.com, datagtsomething, data3gtright   codepre  pI require a new array to be made from masterArray that would merge the individual keys together in the array of arrays into a new key in the new array, based on matching key value pairs in each individual array. So the final array would appear like this...p  precodefinalArray  array     [0]gtarrayidgt123, urlgthttpxyz.com, datagtsomething, data2gtelse, data3gtbaby,     [1]gtarrayidgt456, urlgthttpabc.com, datagtsomething, data2gtcompletely, data3gtdifferent,     [2]gtarrayidgt789, urlgthttpdef.com, datagtsomething, data2gtis not quite, data3gtright,  codepre  pTheres quite an array no pun intended of php functions that can sort  merge arrays or values, but I cannot figure out which ones to use or how to implement it p  pCan anyone figure out a solution to this It would be much appreciated.p  pstrongNote To note, I have done the followingstrongp  pWhat I have tried is the following algorithmp  ol licreate two copies of masterArray call them m1 and m2li liuse two for..each loops. The first for...each loop goes through m1, the second one through m2li ligrab the current element in m1 from the outer loopli licompare the current element in m2 from the inner loopli liif the m1[outerloopindex] matches m2[innerloopindex] through the majority of their key values, create a new array element x, merging their key value pairs.li lipush or add x to newArrayli liand this may or may not work remove the element compared from m1 and m2 since we used them, we dont need them anymore. assume no more matchesli liif the m1[outerloopindex] does not matchm2[innerloopindex] , simply go to the next m2[innerloopindex] value and compare again to m1[outerloopindex] until a match is made or notli liif no elements in m2 match the element compared against in m1, keep m1[outerloopindex] ol liloop again going to m1[outerloopindex1] etc.li olli ol  pBut unfortunately it does not seem to return the correct number of results p  pSample code is below.p  precode    foreachartistData as

Negative 1873 pIs there an interactive XAML editor that can be used with WPF out there, or some way to use VisualStateManager in XamlPadX 4.0p  pIve tried XamlPadX 4.0 which was great until I tried to do something using the VisualStateManager which it choked on. Cursory research indicates that VisualStateManager support arrived in WPF in Dotnet 4 whereas XamlPadX 4 is built using Dotnet 2.5. Attempting to redirect XamlPadX to use Dotnet 4 has not been successful.p  pBlend, as far as I an tell, doesnt appear to have an interactive mode, just a standard VS style coderun iteration cycle.p  pIve had a quick look at Kaxaml. It seems to work but is pretty limited, e.g. no visual tree explorer.p  pUPDATE Blend features suggested by colinsmithp  pI have VS2012 Update 2 installed and Ive tried using Blend but with no success. Entering the following code for example and selecting the Button from the Objects and Timeline panel results in the Objects and Timeline panel displaying No Storyboard open and there being nothing at all in the States panel. Clicking Help in Blend takes me to an MSDN page stating We are sorry. The page you requested cannot be found. and searching the web for guidance on using Blend for VS2012 with WPF throws up nothing, which doesnt surprise me greatly since support for WPF was only added to Blend for VS2012 in VS2012 Update 2 which was only released a couple of days ago.p  pre classlangxml prettyprintoverridecodeltWindow xClassBlendScratchProject.MainWindow         xmlnshttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xamlpresentation         xmlnsxhttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xaml         TitleMainWindow Height91 Width192gt      ltGrid HorizontalAlignmentCenter VerticalAlignmentCentergt         ltButton ContentButtongt             ltButton.Templategt                 ltControlTemplate TargetTypeButtongt                     ltBorder xNamerootElementgt                         ltBorder.Backgroundgt                             ltSolidColorBrush xNameborderBrush ColorBlackgt                         ltBorder.Backgroundgt                          ltGrid Margin4gt                             ltGrid.Backgroundgt                                 ltSolidColorBrush xNamebackgroundBrush ColorGreengt                             ltGrid.Backgroundgt                              ltContentPresenter HorizontalAlignmentTemplateBinding HorizontalContentAlignment                                 VerticalAlignmentTemplateBinding VerticalContentAlignment                                 Margin5gt                         ltGridgt                          ltVisualStateManager.VisualStateGroupsgt                             ltVisualStateGroup xNameCommonStatesgt                                  ltVisualState xNameNormalgt                                  ltVisualState xNameMouseOvergt                                     ltStoryboardgt                                         ltColorAnimation Storyboard.TargetNameborderBrush                                             Storyboard.TargetPropertyColor ToRed Duration000gt                                     ltStoryboardgt                                 ltVisualStategt                              ltVisualStateGroupgt                         ltVisualStateManager.VisualStateGroupsgt                     ltBordergt                 ltControlTemplategt             ltButton.Templategt         ltButtongt     ltGridgt  ltWindowgt codepre
Negative 1873 pAt first it seemed like we were encountering a bug similar to the one reported at a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13410459headrevisionnotworkingasintendedforgoogledocsformatsHead revision not working as intended for Google Docs formatsa, but upon further investigation it seems to be a different one.p  pGoogleformat files documents, spreadsheets, etc. seem to collapse revisions once the number of revisions for a file exceeds a certain limit, and the API seems to return the collapsed set of revisions instead of the full set i.e., the set shown after clicking Show less detailed revisions when viewing the file on the Drive web app.p  pHowever, the API returns the emearliestem revision in each set instead of the latest one. So when trying to retrieve the latest revision either via revisions.list or using head in revisions.get, it often doesnt return the actual latest revision, but instead the first revision in the latest collapsed set.p  pHeres the ID of a public spreadsheet that demonstrates this behavior 0AgbOJk17djyxdGFqZzlRTks2NnNidzRzRGVJWFlDU2cp  pIn this particular case, revision ID 1365416326903000 is returned as the latest, even though there are many later revisions.p

Negative 1873 pIve got an issue with Disqus on a Tumblr theme at present.p  pThe theme itself uses Isotope if youre not familiar its essentially a more featureful, paid version of Masonry, and has Disqus integration.p  pThe issue is that the client wants us to place the Disqus comments inside the same div as the individual posts. Unfortunately, Isotope and Disqus dont play well together  what happens is that Isotope lays out the page before the iFrame that Disqus loads in has finished loading, mucking up the layout in the process. I can quite easily relayout the page by running codeisotope.isotopereLayoutcode, but Im having trouble finding a good way of triggering it.p  pI need to trigger it once all the iframes on the page have finished loading.

Negative 1873 pI have developed a webbased online registration system for one of our clients, using PHP, jquery and ajax and  MySQL as the backend. The site is sitting on a dedicated LINUX Server  hosted at our ISP.p  pThe challenge I have  is that the site crashes and falls over as around 2500 people try to enter when registrations open. From what we can see is that hundreds of participants open up the registration page, and then continually hits the page refresh. The page itself makes a MySQL db call and returns the button that gets clicked on when registration opens. p  pI have thought off load balancing, but it is not viable at this stage. Is there a way one can develop a QUEING system whereby the system allows for example a blocks of lets say 300 people at a time to continue or register whilst putting the balance of the other people in a waiting area with a script that displays the position that person is in that queuep  pHope this makes sensep

Negative 1873 pI have a question about how best to check if a service is still running.p  pFirst a bit of clarification. The service I have is a C application which can either be run from the command line or can be run as a Windows Service. The function of the service is to check for changes to a remote 3rd party data source and process those changes before adding them to our own local data store. p  pI want to be able to identify when the service has stopped functioning for whatever reason, and notify somebody when this happens as automatically as possible. This needs to happen regardless of whether the service is being run as a Windows Service or from the command line.p  pI have already considered monitoring the local data store for changes and notifying when changes havent happened for a set amount of time, however this has proven to be a little too inconsistent, because the frequency of changes to the 3rd party data source is variable, which means that a prolonged lack of changes doesnt necessarily indicate that the service has stopped working, it could just be that there are no changes p  pAre there any suggestions about how I might go about monitoring this Anyone got any experience working with something similarp  pThanks, Mp  pstrongEdit 1strong Just to give a rough idea of how the service works The 3rd party service raises events when newupdated data is available so my service sits and waits for these events to be raised and processes the data returned in the raised event. Therefore this is why its tricky to identify when theres no changes rather than service crashed.p  pstrongEdit 2strong  I think I need to be a little clearer The main reason for this monitoring is to notify a user about a potential issue either with the service or with the connection to the 3rd party service. The service itself is single threaded and has proper exception handling and logging. Chances are this service is going to be run on a server somewhere so if there are any problems with the service and it stops updating our local data store for whatever reason the service needs to notify someone. p

Negative 1873 pCurrently I have a utility jar that contains a number of datastore services. Behind the scenes these datastore services use Spring Data MongoDB, and everything is configured using an appcontext.xml file in the utility jar. I want this utility jar to be able to change the backing store without having to change anything that uses this utility jar.p  pNow, I want to create a spring mvc web application that uses the datastore services from this utility jar.p  pHow do I set this up so that the spring mvc web app or any other jar can easily use the datastore services without having to know too much about the utility jar, but still have the beans in the utility jar loaded properlyp  pI was thinking of adding a new java bean class to the utility jar that would load the appcontext in its own jar, and then set some properties on itself for the services. Then the spring mvc would create a bean using this new class in my utility jar, and reference the services through this bean.p  precode  This bean would exist in the utility jar, and other jarswebapps would  create a new instance of this bean.  public class Services       private MyAService myAService     private MyBService myBService      public Services         ClassPathXmlApplicationContext ctx  new ClassPathXmlApplicationContextappcontext.xml          these are configured in the appcontext.xml        this.myAService  ctx.getBeanmyAService        this.myBService  ctx.getBeanmyBService       codepre  pIs this a good way to go about this It seems like I would now have two spring application contexts, is that ok How do I ensure that the proper appcontext.xml is loaded, and not one from another jar Is there a better way of doing thisp

Negative 1873 pI have a celery worker that is kicking off a long task the code that does the task is correct because when I run without a celery worker it works as expected.

Negative 1873 pI have created a multinode hadoop cluster and installed hive on it. Also, on another remote machine I have installed MySQL.  I intend to export data stored in HDFS into relational database MySQL. I researched about how this can be done using Sqoop. So I found that I need to create a table in MySQL that has target columns in the same orderas present in Hive, with the appropriate SQL types. And then use the sqoop export command. p  pMy question is If the table is partitioned in Hive, and if while creating the table in MySQL I partition it accordingly, will the sqoop export command preserve the partitions My question is similar to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14435676sqoopexportmysqlpartitionsqoop export mysql partitiona.

So, what I though of was counting my cars, one one hand. On the other hand see all the available dates for the first car and for each day available see if other cars are also available on this day. In fact the number of my cars must correspond to the count of available dates. I hope Ive been clear. Anyway this was was I though ofp  pmy controllerp  precodedef availabledate   cars  0   available  0   cars  appointment.cars.count    appointment.cars.first.availability.each do d     available  Availability.findallbydayd.day     if available.count  cars       appointment.day  available     end   available.save   end end codepre  pThis doesnt seem to work, also I was thinking, if there are more than one availability it would not work also. p

Negative 1873 pLearning NASM Assembly, I am trying to make a program that reads two onedigit number inputs.p  pI have two variables declared in the code.bsscodep  precodenum1 resb 1 num2 resb 1 codepre  pThen, I ask the user to write the numbers like thisp  precode Get number 1 mov EAX,3 mov EBX,1 mov ECX,num1 mov EDX,1 int 0x80   Get number 2 mov EAX,3 mov EBX,1 mov ECX,num2 mov EDX,1 int 0x80 codepre  pSince I am only interested in onedigit number inputs, I set codeEDXcode to code1code. This way, whatever the user types, only the first character will be stored in my variable right.p  pThe problem is that everything that follows after that first character will be used for the future reads. If you type code5code and then press codeENTERcode, code5code will be stored in codenum1code just fine, but the line break you generated by pressing codeENTERcode will carry on to the next read instruction, which will be stored in codenum2code. Clearly thats not what I was intending I want the user to type a number, press ENTER, type another number, and press ENTER.p  pI am not entirely sure how to work around this in the simplest way possible.p  pThe dumbest idea was to put a dummy read instruction between codenum1code and codenum2code, which will capture the line break and do nothing with it. This is obviously not good.p

Negative 1873 pIm developing a multitenant application on Mvc 5 and the new Asp.net Identity.  The challenge is that two users can have the same username, just not on the same tenant.  I have this figured out for the most part, but for some reason all of the tables generated by the Identity framework have a UserId column, except the UserSecret entitys table.  Is there a reason for this  I want to make sure Im not missing something before I replace it with an implementation that has a UserId column.p

Negative 1873 pMy problem is testing InApp purchase in my Mac OS X application  it seems to me that the problem is related to my test account. I could test IAP on my own Mac quite well with a test user account before. But a few weeks ago while I was trying to make a purchase in sandbox a dialog box showed up saying that I should review my account information on App Store, I made a mistake by logging into the real App Store and my test account cant be used for testing now. p  pHere is the problem I deleted the old test account and created a new one. Now, when I want to test the IAP the dialog box that asks if I want to purchase a product in sandbox environment and the next one that prompts for userpass dont show up. p  pUsing NSLog I figured out that when I enter InApp store, products are being loaded and when I click on a product to buy it, app starts buying product with product ID. If I am right, at this stage the prompt should show up saying do you want to buy product myproduct [sandbox environment] But this dialog box never shows up I never experienced the same problem with the old test account.p  pAny suggessionsp

Negative 1873 pI have a for loop that runs over 100 range values and for each value, I call scipy.optimize to do a nonlinear curve fitting. When I run it on a 4core desktop, I see the CPU utilization as 100 which is just 1 core fully used. I want to use multi threading if that will help or if not, multi processing. I just started doing python for the last 3 days and so is there a simple example that I can use to modify my current for loop.p
Negative 1873 pIm using the codeHttpClientcode and I need to set a nonstandard type for the codeHttpMethodcode.

Negative 1873 pIn a physicsbased CoronaSDK game I have a number of color balls. They all collide with each other. However Im interested in those balls grouped together by their color. p  pSo, each of the balls has a color property codeball.color  redcode for example. p  pIn the listener for collisions I check if ball collided with the one with the same color p  precodelocal function ballCollision  self, event    local otherBall  event.other   if  otherBall.color  self.color  then      do some stuff here     if  event.phase  began  then         add the ball to the group     else        remove the ball from the group     end   end end  ball.collision  ballCollision balladdEventListener  collision   codepre  pNow, I was thinking about creating a global, modulewide, table of groups, where I could keep a table of grouped balls. With each codebegancode phase of the collision I could add a ball colliding to the group the other collider belongs. p  pWith each codeendedcode phase I could remove it from a group. p  pBut this presents some quite heavy, I think calculations, for when the larger group is split to several smaller groups by one ball leaving it... p  pIs there some better solution to perform this Like  getting a list of chained objects, or at least getting a list of colliders for each physics object  p
Negative 1873 pI have a java program thats extracting a date from the contents of a file, and then renaming the file with that date string. What I need to account for is that the new file name may end up having the date at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end. What I was trying to do was something like this p  precodeString outputFilePt1  args[0] String outputFilePt2  args[1] String outputFilePt3  args[2]  String outputDate  dateFormat.format date  String newOutputFile  outputFilePt1  outputFilePt2  outputFilePt3 codepre  pI would then enter something like MyFile, outputDate, .csv for args 02, respectively, hoping that the result would be MyFileoutputDatesValue.csv  because I may need it to be MyFile.csvoutputDatesValue p  pWhat would be the best way to accomplish taking 3 inputs  FilePart1, FilePart2, FilePart3 where one would end up with the value of outputDate in the above code blockp  pThanks in advance, I hope what Im asking makes sensep  pEDIT  I do not know the value of outputDate at the time I input the arguments. This is calculated based on the input file and a configproperties file that determines the date formatlocation of the input file.p

Negative 1873 pI have a TextureView with a mediaPlayer attached to it, so i can use its surface to display a video, so far its working well. Now i try to create a fade in animation for displaying the video and i have no clue of how to do it.p  pI tried with the setOpaquefalse setting and playing with the alpha setting but it doesnt have any effects. Also i tried the textureView without a mediaPlayer and i notice that i cant change the background color either, its always black. The documentation say that the behaviour of this view is the same as the standard view, but it doesnt seem to be the case. Does anyone know how to change the transparency of this view p  pThanksp

Negative 1873 pI am currently developing a android game with AndEngine. It really works great so far, except for one problem i cannot seem to figure out how to solve.  Every time i upload the game to my phone to debug and let it start, the gameplay movement freezes or goes extremely slow for a couple of seconds and a threadid4 reacting to signal 3 message appears in the LogCat.  If i then close the game and start it up again from the phone itself not with eclipse it seems to be completely fine. Reading about that message i pulled the log from the device but i am unable to find out how to tackle this problem.

Negative 1873 pI am currently building a parser by hand. It is a LL1 parser. At the moment, it is a great recognizer its function parseList tokens decides whether or not tokens is a member of the language or not.p  pNow, I want to build the corresponding AST for that input. However, I know how to implement it in a recursive descent way already did it. That is, for the challenge, I implement my stack using a stack with the classical algorithmp  precodenext lt first token of the input stack lt STARTSYMBOL do      top lt stack.pop     if top is a terminal and top  next          next lt next token of the input      else if top is a non terminal and PARSINGTABLE[top, next] exists          stack.pushPARSINGTABLE[top, next]      else           return invalid input       while stack is not empty return valid input codepre  pwhere the PARSINGTABLE is the LL1 table. However, I wonder how to implement the part which build the AST in such a configuration. I do not ask for complete implementation, more for implementation idea.p  pThanks p

Negative 1873 pThis is the first time I am working with the Canvas class in Androidp  pwhat I want is to draw with different colors and brushes on the canvas with using Path class. I dont want to use Bitmap, because I need to apply proper undo redo functionality on It. What I am doing is just draw on the canvas, but in onDraw function, I draw whole path using for loop, but If user select different colors and brushes to draw, here issue occurs.

Negative 1873 pSome context, I am running a script on a websites home page to swap background images on a timer. We decided it would be better to attempt to implement preloading of the images, which prompts the following issue in Firefoxp  pPreloading images on the first page load will not prevent the browser from loading the image from the original source again instead of the cache. Oddly though, refreshing the page will successfully cause the image to be loaded in from the cache.p  pThe JavaScript that runs on page load takes all of the image URLs, and attempts to preload them via calling codenew Image.src  http ...code for each one.p  pInspecting the page load revealed that the images would be loaded in on page load, but then the image would also be loaded in again when the slide was revealed.p  pTest Image Link SO reputation restrictions a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comE9KLM.png relnofollowhttpi.stack.imgur.comE9KLM.pngap  pIn the image, the images 66.png, 21.png, 63.png, and 83.png were preloaded from the JavaScript, but are then requested again when the slider reveals that slide.p  pWhats also strange is that the bottom images look like they were queued to be loading in since the page was created. Maybe its because this takes priority over the script that was loaded once the document was readyp  pTo finish off, if I was to refresh the page and jump to a slide that was preloaded with the images, but never revealed, it is shown to be loaded from the cache like it should have been originally.p  pMy theory is that the original background images are maybe declared to needing to be loaded from the server when the page is first loaded, but arent actually loaded until the slide is revealed. On document ready, when the javascript preloads the images, theyre not cached yet so they need to be loaded from the server. Then a slide is revealed and the browser tells that image that it needs to be loaded as originally declared.p  pDoes anyone know why this situation is occuring If so, are there any solutions to resolvep  pI have an idea that involves adding the image URLs as a dataurl attribute instead, and then having javascript preload them and add them as background images at that point, but I havent tested this yet.p

Negative 1873 pI am building a custom UI framework in WPF where I basically ditch as much of the builtin layout system and controls as I can. So far I have been branching off from codeUIElementcode directly, but since I am already doing the measure, arrange and rendering myself, I am thinking I could slice off more of the WPF legacy by getting even closer to the metal especially when it comes to layout  rendering. How close is it possible to get while staying in managed code and not being afraid of doing the dirty work myselfp  pI am toying with a prototype concept on the side now where I only have one element inheriting from UIElement a codeRootcode object, similar to a stripped down codeCanvascode, that hosts the rest of my layout engine and channels relevant codeIInputElementcode benefits into it. From that point onward, all elements would be completely custom objects not inheriting from anything in WPF, but rendering directly into the codeDrawingContextcode of Root in its codeOnRendercode method.p  pNow Im wondering about the relative performance of having a codeWriteableBitmapcode root element and manually draw onto that instead, for example using a hrefhttpwriteablebitmapex.codeplex.com relnofollow titleWriteableBitmapExWriteableBitmapExa for convenience. Not having antialiasing isnt an issue, neither is a custom hit testing system.p  pMy thoughts are primarily that WriteableBitmapEx does not have the privilege of any GPU acceleration gains and therefore will be [much] slower when large areas needs to be repainted  transformed.p  pI do have other needs for a pixelbasedrenderingengineintheengine, though, so I am still interested in some perspective on this.p  pAny insightsp  pEdit And what about SharpDX in this context Maybe once Im at it I might as well go for a WinForms solution with a DirectX wrapper like SharpDX ..or.. I guess what I emreallyem should do is sign up for the whole C enchilada, but unfortunately I dont have time to start learning emthatem in the midst of things..p

Negative 1873 pWhen a user which is not logged in to Facebook or Twitter, clicks the liketweet button, a popup comes up asking the user to log in. This popup is not blocked by popup blockers of any kind. in IE for example, it opens up but anyway IE state a warning to the user. The bottom line is that all buttons probably use the same method. I have a button that people click on it and it should open a similar screen, but it always gets blocked. The button in JS works pretty much like FB like button. It checks if the user is logged in. If he does, then send the like to the servers. If he does not, then the login popup appears and gets blocked. So, it is a initiated by a user although not fully direct outcome, since we need to check if he logged in or not. What is best method to do thatp

Negative 1873 pIn CakePHP 3.0 named parameters have been removed thank god in favour of standard query string parameters inline with other application frameworks.p  pWhat Im still struggling to get my head around though is that in other MVC frameworks, for example ASP.NET you would pass the parameters in the ActionResult same as functionp  precodeEdit int id  null         do stuff with id   codepre  pAnd that method would be passed the id as a query string like codeEditid1code and youd use Routing to make it pretty like codeEdit1code.p  pIn CakePHP however anything passed inside the function parameters likep  precodefunction edit id  null         do stuff with id   codepre  pMust be done as a passed parameter like codeEdit1code which bypasses the query string idea and also the need for routing to improve the URL.p  pIf I name the params in the link for that edit likep  precodethisgtHtmlgtlinkEdit, arrayaction gt edit, id gt postgtid codepre  pI then have to dop  precodepublic function edit       id  thisgtrequestgtqueryid       do stuff with id   codepre  pTo get at the parameter id passed. Would of thought it would pick it up in the function like in ASP.NET for CakePHP 3.0 but it doesnt.p  pI prefer to prefix the passed values in the edit link instead of just passing them so I dont have to worry about the ordinal as much on the other end and I know what they are etc.p  pHas anyone played with either of these ways of passing data to their methods in CakePHP and can shed more light on the correct ways of doing things and how the changes in version 3.0 will improve things in this area...p

Negative 1873 pI am currently building an ASP.NET Web API which unique purpose is to provide data to a Windows Phone app. I already finished the Web API development and I published it in an Azure website for testing purpose.p  pIt works like a charm but my issue now is that this Web API is now publicly accessible. What I would like is to find the simplest way to limit the audience to my particular Windows Phone app and nobody else. I first thought of using an API key but it does not seem that ASP.NET proposes this as a builtin option. The builtin options are not satisfying either because their require a login.p  pBasically I want that only my Windows Phone app can access the Web API and that this authorization is transparent for the user no authentication required.

In that case, I would like to be able to tell the client to fetch the resource via HTTP even if the cache contains it and it isnt marked as stale yet.p  pWhen Ive run into situations like this in JavaScript I have often appended a bogus query string parameter with a timestamp in it so that the URL would not match a cached entry.

The goal is to bypass the cache in this instance regardless of whether or not the remote server says it canshould be cached.p  pSomeone might also suggest not using a caching codeHttpClientcode in this case, which would be OK, but it seems less than ideal to me because then I would need to make a second codeHttpClientcode other portions of this application require caching of these HTTP resources in order to perform sufficiently well.p  pstrongEDITstrong user3360944 suggested using a a hrefhttphc.apache.orghttpcomponentsclientgahttpclientcacheapidocsorgapachehttpclientcacheHttpCacheInvalidator.html relnofollowcodeHttpCacheInvalidatorcodea, which may be the right solution, but I am not sure yet how to do this.

Negative 1873 pI am having some problems understanding the concept of component instantiation in iPOJO. I read a hrefhttpfelix.apache.orgdocumentationsubprojectsapachefelixipojoapachefelixipojouserguideapachefelixipojoinstances.html relnofollowthis guidea and I get the analogy to classes and objects but I still have some concrete problems and some conceptual problems that I hope someone can clarifyp  pI thought I needed to create instances via iPOJO emInstantiateem or factories strongonlystrong for service providers since they never use emnewem because the impl is always hidden. However, I have some consumers emComponentem that I instantiate myself say in a main method where I call emnewem on them directly. I made them emComponentem because they need to have things injected. I was assuming that the ipojo bytecode manipulation would make it so that when the objects were constructed, they would have their dependencies injected Im using mostly method injection with emBindem but it seems that is not the case. Can someone clarify this to me please. Now it seems to me that for iPOJO to do any injection at all I need to always use one of the iPOJO instantiation techniques. The problem I have is that then the constructors I made in the consumer classes are not called.p  pThis is a simplified example to illustrate my confusionp  precodeComponentnametest public class MyFoo      private ListltExternalgt externals injected     private Bar bar passed via constructor. Bar is not a Component      public MyFooBar otherBar          bar  otherBar         externals  new ArrayList           Bindaggregatetrue     public addExternalExternal service          externals.addservice       codepre  pSo, as can be seen here, I need to have all the providers of interface codeExternalcode, but I also need a codeBarcode object that I pass when I construct the object using codenew MyFoosomeBarcodep  pMy problem is that if I need to pass a codeBarcode to the constructor then I need to use emnewem but If i use emnewem, iPojo never invokes my injection method. On the other hand, if I use iPOJOs instantiation say I add Instantiate then the injection does happen but the constructor is not invoked, so the bind throws a NPE because the list has not been created yet  bar will not be set. I know I can create the list inside the bind method, but my question is more conceptual. p  ol liHow are you supposed to accomplish this framework injection  argument passing in the constructor li liHow can iPOJO be calling addExternal which means the object has been created without calling my one and only constructor that creates the object this is very counterintuitive in standard javali liAre you just not supposed to use constructors when using iPOJO components maybeli ol

Negative 1873 pHi Im learning Angular JS and so far is going well but... Ive noticed I have to produce more and more code than normal to do a simple think eg.p  pI have my setup objectp  precodevar AppConfig       defaultEvent  orders,     jsonTimeout  15000,     jsonURL  httpsmydomain.com  localstorage[myItem]  codepre  pso then somewhere within the controller I use some of the objects AppConfig.jsonTimeout. What I dont understand is why something simple like access local storage required additional 3rd modulep  pDo I have to have some mainController wrapping all other controllers where I have all my variables and this way I can access local storage across the app What is the simplest practice to do something like example above is there a way to use HTML5 local storage without 3rd party modulep  pThanks p

Well, that is my first question.p  pMy second question is about an other forloop i used, that it got ignored.p  precodeprintfPROCESS gtdn,id      for i  0 i lt PARTS i         printfArray No.dn, i1         for j  0 j lt MAXWORDS j             printfd, ,0         printfnn      codepre  pI run that forloop and every process printed only the first linep  precode mpiexec n 6 pwdtest PROCESS gt0 PROCESS gt1 PROCESS gt3 PROCESS gt2 PROCESS gt4 PROCESS gt5 codepre  pAnd not the following amount of zeros there was an array there at first that i removed cause i was trying to figure out why it didnt get printed.p  pSo, why is it about MPI and forloops that dont get along p  pedit 1 grammar edit 2 Code pastep  pIt is not the same as above, but same problem in the the last forloop with fprintf.p  pa hrefhttppaste.debian.net97068 relnofollowThis is a paste zone, sorry for that, i couldnt deal with the code system hereap  pedit 3 fixedp  pWell i finally figured it out. For first i have to say that the fprintf function when used inside MPI is a mess. Apparently there is a kind of overlap while every process writes in a text file. I tested it with the printf function and it worked. The second thing i was doing is, i was calling the MPIScatter function from inside rootp  precodeifrankroot MPIScatter codepre  p..which only scatters the data inside the process and not the others.p  pNow that i have fixed those two issues, the program works as it should, apart a minor problem when i printf the mylist arrays. It seems like every array has a random number of inputs, but when i tested using a counter for every array, its only the data that is printed like this. Tried using fflushstdout but it returned me an error.p  precodeusrlibgccx8664pclinuxgnu4.2.2........x8664pclinuxgnubinld final link failed Inputoutput error collect2 ld returned 1 exit status codepre

My question is what could cause this Does it have something to do with the depth buffer Ive found that enabling face culling will hide the effect in this case, but why should that be necessary Shouldnt a face which is occluded by a nearer face be hidden regardlessp  precodeinclude ltGLgl.hgt include ltGLglu.hgt include ltGLglut.hgt  typedef struct     int width     int height     char  title  window window win  float theta  0 const float rotRate  0.05complete rotations per second int lastTime  const float verts[][3]       0.0,0.0,0.0,     1.0,0.0,0.0,     0.0,1.0,0.0,     0.0,0.0,1.0,     0.0,1.0,1.0,     1.0,0.0,1.0,     1.0,1.0,0.0,     1.0,1.0,1.0  const int faceIndices[][4]       3,5,7,4,front     1,0,2,6,back     4,7,6,2,top     0,1,5,3,bottom     5,1,6,7,right     0,3,4,2left  void display     timing and rotation      int currentTime  glutGetGLUTELAPSEDTIME     int dt  lastTime  currentTime     lastTime  currentTime     theta  floatdt1000.0rotRate360.0     if theta gt 360.0 theta  360.0      draw     glClearGLCOLORBUFFERBIT  GLDEPTHBUFFERBIT     glMatrixModeGLMODELVIEW     glLoadIdentity     glTranslatef0.0, 0.0, 5.0     glRotateftheta, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0     glTranslatef1.0,1.0,1.0     glScalef2.0, 2.0, 2.0     int f     forf0 flt6f         glBeginGLPOLYGON         int v         forv0 vlt4 v             glColor3fvverts[faceIndices[f][v]]             glVertex3fvverts[faceIndices[f][v]]                  glEnd           glutSwapBuffers   void initializeGLUTint  argc, char  argv     glutInitargc, argv     glutInitDisplayModeGLUTRGB  GLUTDEPTH  GLUTDOUBLE     glutInitWindowSizewin.width, win.height     glutCreateWindowOpenGL Cube     glutDisplayFuncdisplay     glutIdleFuncdisplay   void initializeGL     Setup Viewport matrix     glViewport0,0,win.width, win.height      Setup Projection matrix     glMatrixModeGLPROJECTION     glLoadIdentity     gluPerspective45,float win.widthwin.height, 0.1, 100.0      Initialize Modelview matrix     glMatrixModeGLMODELVIEW     glLoadIdentity      Other     glClearColor0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0     glClearDepth1.0   int mainint argc, char argv     win.width  640     win.height  480      initializeGLUTampargc, argv     initializeGL      glutMainLoop      return 0  codepre

Negative 1873 pIf I write a nontrivial recursive function i.e. using codefunctioncode rather than codefuncode, then the code generator refuses to execute my function unless I supply a termination proof  even a codesorrycodeproof suffices.

Negative 1873 pI have some code that accepts an IEnumerable and generates an Excel document from it. The objects in the IEnumerable have a date field, and I want those to be formatted as dates in Excel. However, when you look at it in Excel, the dates dont seem to be of the date data type until you double click in the cell, then press enter. When you do that, the values moves to right justified, and table filters work correctly. If you dont do the double click and enter thing, the value is left justified and table filters treat it as text instead of a date. I need Excel to treat it as a date out of the box.p  pHeres my code.p  precode ltsummarygt  Converts any IEnumerable to an Excel Document.

I still dont know too much about it because I figured that I really shouldnt have to when it comes to making the small modification that I want, but this is giving me such a headache. All I want to do is be able to properly map a texture to an irregular concave quad.p  pLike thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.come8yls.jpg altenter image description herep  pI went into openGL to figure out how to do this before I tried running code in the game.

Ive looked at this a hrefhttpwww.imagemagick.orgUsagescriptsperspectivetransform relnofollowhttpwww.imagemagick.orgUsagescriptsperspectivetransforma, but I really dont have a clue where the 8 constants this guy is talking about came from or if it will even help me. Ive also been told to do a hrefhttpalumni.media.mit.educwreninterpolator relnofollowcalculations with matricesa, but Ive got no idea how much of that openGL does or doesnt take care of.p  pIve looked at several posts regarding this, and the answer I need is somewhere in those, but I cant make heads or tails of em. I can never find a post that tells me what arguments Im supposed to put in the glTexCoord4f method in order to have the perspectivecorrect transform.p  pIf youre thinking of the Getting to know the Q coordinate page as a solution to my problem, Im afraid Ive already looked at it, and it has failed me.p  pIs there something Im missing I feel like this should be a lot easier. I find it hard to believe that openGL, with all its bells and whistles, would have nothing for making something other than a rectangle.p  pSo, I hope I havent pissed you off too much with my cluelessness, and thanks in advance. p  pEDIT I think I need to make clear that I know openGL does perspective transform for you when your view of the quad is not orthogonal.

Negative 1873 pMy understanding of Spring MVC is that the View layer is responsible for the user interface that is populated with data, the Model represents a Map of values made available to the View Layer, and the Controller controls how and what data is passed to the Model as well as what business logic is carried out.  The business logic can be divided into one or more other layers  generally a Service layer andor Data Access layer.  Is this correctp  pIve seen other explanations for the MVC pattern where the Model is considered a layer with Entities, Data Access Objects, and Services.  The View is responsible for the user interface.  And the Controller is the gateway between the two.  I dont think this applies to Spring MVC and other implementations of MVC for web frameworks.p

Negative 1873 pIm relatively new to programming and C, but Ive been trying to create my own delay function in C.  In essence, it would pause the program for the number of seconds the user puts  in.

However, the the program does not print the first output before delaying, which is certainly not what I want  The program instead waits ten seconds as soon as the program starts, and then prints the two statements, instead of printing the first statement, delaying, then printing the last.p  pAm I missing something with my understanding of time Or will this not work for some reason Again, for clarification, Im trying to fix the problem where the delay happens BEFORE anything else in the program happens, even if the function comes after other functions.

Negative 1873 pI have a HashMap that I am using to store information from my database. I have a Result Set that reads from each column of the database, and the Result Set is used to initialize a few string variables. These strings are then used in the HashMap. For example, one of my lines of code for my HashMap is codeparameters.putCertificateCode, CertificateCodecode. From what Im beginning to understand, the first parameter of the HashMap allows the application to know WHERE to put the information, and the second parameter tells the HashMap WHAT information to put in.p  pHere is my problem... I noticed that if I try to run a loop through these lines of code, it will simply replace an existing value in the HashMap with the new one, thus only displaying the last record from my database.p  pHow would I go about making the HashMap allow for the storage of multiple database records I need this to work in a way that would still allow me to pass the parameters in to my Jasper Report. This method is codeJasperPrint jasperPrint  JasperFillManager.fillReportcode, and it requires the parameters of codeJasperReportcode, codeMapltString, Objectgtcode, and a codeConnectioncode.p  pI thought it might work if I added an array list to the HashMap. However, the fillReport method will not accept this as a proper parameter.p  pAny help would be much appreciated I have been fighting with this reporting library for way too long now.p  pThank you.p

Negative 1873 pWhat I am trying to achieve is that when the user scrolls the page using the mousewheel as there is no scrollbar, the page slides down with an animation to the next section of the page and while the animation is being played, mousewheel wont work to tidy things up, which is a good act.p  pThe behavior I want can be seen in a hrefhttpgoogle.cominbox relnofollowhttpgoogle.cominboxa or a hrefhttpwww.luxaquadesign.com relnofollowhttpwww.luxaquadesign.coma.p  pThe thing I liked in Googles inbox website is that it has the same effects with touch screen devices and their scrolling mechanisms.p  pI only need some pointers about the events that happen in this kind of scrolling and how I can manage them specially, I am looking to achieve the same functionality with touch devices.p
Negative 1873 pI have to implement a fisheye transfromation with bilinear interpolation. After the transformation of one pixel i dont have integer coordinates anymore and I would like to map this pixel on integer coordinates using bilinear interpolation. The problem is that everithing I found on bilinear interpolation on the inetrnete see for example Wikipedia does the opposite thing it gives the value of one noninteger pixel by using the coordinates of four neighbors that have integer coordinates.  I would like to do the opposite, i.e. map the one pixel with noninteger coordinates to the four neighbors with integer coordinates. Surely there is something that I am missing and would be helpful to understand where I am wrong.p  pEDIT TO be more clear Let say that I have the pixel i,j2,2 of the starting image. After the fisheye transformation I obtain noninteger coordinates, for example 2.1,2.2. I want to save this new pixel to a new image but obviously I dont know in which pixel to save it because of noninteger coordinates. The easiest way is to truncate the coordinates, but the image quality is not very good I have to use bilinear interpolation. Despite this I dont understand how it works because I want to split my non integer pixel to neighboring pixels with integer coordinates of the new transformed image, but I found description only of the opposite operation, i.e. finding noninteger coordinates starting from four integer pixels a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiBilinearinterpolation relnofollowhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiBilinearinterpolationap

Negative 1873 pI am fairly new to using uwsgi with python scripts, so hopefully this is a naive mistake. p  pI have two different web applications that interact with separate but related python libraries, lets call them lib1.py and lib2.pyp  pIf I use these libraries from the command line, I get no errors.p  pI have created two python files, app1.py and app2.py that are each attached to different uwsgi sockets. The basic framework of these files isp  precodeimport lib1.py  load objects into memory MyObject  lib1.MyClassinitparams  applicationenviron, startresponse     status  200 OK      output  MyObject.processRequest      responseheaders  [Contenttype, texthtml,                         ContentLength, strlenoutput]      startresponsestatus, responseheaders      return [output] codepre  pSame for app2.py importing lib2...p  pApp1 works great and I had no problem getting it set up. It loads dozens of large 100000 rows, 100 columns numpy arrays when MyObject is initialized and keeps them in memory for the application function to calculate on when it receives requests from the web server. p  pApp2 has not yet worked... lib2.py imports lib1.py as it needs to do similar calculations on a large numpy array as part of its job. The weird thing is that its one of the lib1.py functions that throws the SEGFAULT. At first, I thought maybe this was a symptom of some weird doubleimporting going on, which is why I separated the uwsgi into two separate sockets and apps as described above when I first saw this happening. The weirder thing is that lib2 uses only 1 large numpy array, and it is smaller than the largest of the lib1 numpy arrays. By placing a number of codeprintcode statements into my code and looking at the logs, I was able to find the exact line where the segfault is happeningp  precodeinnerproductarray  np.dotself.coordinates, vector.T codepre  pself.coordinates is a 2d MxN array, and vector.T is an Nx1 column vector. The SEGFAULT goes away, if I limit the self.coordinates array like so codeself.coordinates[500,]codep  pBut the SEGFAULT happens whenever the slice gets much bigger than 500, which is nowhere near the 150000 I need. Again, this calculation causes no problem in lib1, when self.coordinates can get up to 500000 x 200p  pI feel like I have followed through as much as possible in terms of making sure that no moduleslibraries were being double imported. Other numpy functions behave fine, and, again, lib2 works perfectly fine with large arrays when used from the command line.p  pThe only other weird symptom to mention is that, before, when I had a single app.py file that handled all my uwsgi python code and handled requests for different apps using the PATHINFO environment variable including others besides these two, all the apps worked fine together until I added lib2. Once lib2 was added, lib1 broke and started giving SEGFAULTS as well. The other apps which have no dependencies on lib1 or lib2 were fine.p  pHere is the error from the logp  precode uWSGI is running in multiple interpreter mode  spawned uWSGI worker 1 and the only pid 33866, cores 1  uWSGI process 33866 got Segmentation Fault   backtrace of 33866  0   uwsgi                               0x00000001062f9420 uwsgibacktrace  48 1   uwsgi                               0x00000001062f9963 uwsgisegfault  51 2   libsystemplatform.dylib            0x00007fff9190ef1a sigtramp  26 3   multiarray.so                       0x0000000106fd4efe arraydealloc  158 4   libBLAS.dylib                       0x00007fff908911ff rowMajorNoTranspose  689 5   libBLAS.dylib                       0x00007fff9088f2c9 cblasdgemv  783 6   dotblas.so                         0x00000001072e0129 dotblasmatrixproduct  5513 7   libpython2.7.dylib                  0x00000001067d27c9 PyEvalEvalFrameEx  14387 8   libpython2.7.dylib                  0x00000001067ced62 PyEvalEvalCodeEx  1413 9   libpython2.7.dylib                  0x00000001067d557d PyEvalSliceIndex  757 10  libpython2.7.dylib                  0x00000001067d23e3 PyEvalEvalFrameEx  13389 11  libpython2.7.dylib                  0x00000001067ced62 PyEvalEvalCodeEx  1413 12  libpython2.7.dylib                  0x00000001067d557d PyEvalSliceIndex  757 13  libpython2.7.dylib                  0x00000001067d23e3 PyEvalEvalFrameEx  13389 14  libpython2.7.dylib                  0x00000001067ced62 PyEvalEvalCodeEx  1413 15  libpython2.7.dylib                  0x00000001067d557d PyEvalSliceIndex  757 16  libpython2.7.dylib                  0x00000001067d23e3 PyEvalEvalFrameEx  13389 17  libpython2.7.dylib                  0x00000001067ced62 PyEvalEvalCodeEx  1413 18  libpython2.7.dylib                  0x00000001067d557d PyEvalSliceIndex  757 19  libpython2.7.dylib                  0x00000001067d23e3 PyEvalEvalFrameEx  13389 20  libpython2.7.dylib                  0x00000001067ced62 PyEvalEvalCodeEx  1413 21  libpython2.7.dylib                  0x000000010677330a PyFunctionSetClosure  826 22  libpython2.7.dylib                  0x00000001067552ac PyObjectCall  99 23  libpython2.7.dylib                  0x00000001067d4d6b PyEvalCallObjectWithKeywords  93 24  uwsgi                               0x0000000106314097 pythoncall  23 25  uwsgi                               0x000000010631620f uwsgirequestwsgi  879 26  uwsgi                               0x00000001062ab530 wsgireqrecv  288 27  uwsgi                               0x00000001062f7205 simplelooprun  229 28  uwsgi                               0x00000001062fe577 uwsgiignition  439 29  uwsgi                               0x00000001062fe363 uwsgiworkerrun  835 30  uwsgi                               0x00000001062fbe7a uwsgirun  442 31  uwsgi                               0x00000001062f9b0e main  14 32  libdyld.dylib                       0x00007fff854425c9 start  1  end of backtrace  codepre  pAnd here is the xml config for uwsgi I am using for app2p  precodeltuwsgigt     ltsocketgt127.0.0.13033ltsocketgt     ltchdirgtabspathtositefolderwsgiltchdirgt     ltwsgifilegtabspathtositefolderwsgiapp2.pyltwsgifilegt     ltlogtogtabspathtologdirapp2.logltlogtogt     ltpidfilegtapp2.pidltpidfilegt     ltenablethreadsgtltenablethreadsgt     ltdaemonize2gtltdaemonize2gt ltuwsgigt codepre  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pI created an identical setup on an Amazon Linux EC2 server and everything worked without error.

Negative 1873 pIm making a JavaFX program for which I would like to use the new Time API. I wanted to use the LocalDatePicker provided in the JFXtras library which would allow users to select multiple localdate objects and would streamline the programs handling of selected objects as opposed to the similar CalendarPicker in the same library which uses the older date API.p  pI imported the custom JFXtras controls into JavaFX scene builder, and while the multiple selection mode works very well for the JFXtras CalendarPicker control, the same functionality seems broken in the LocalDatePicker control.p  pMultipleRange selection does not work in either the preview feature of scene builder, in a compiled FXMLcontroller file generated in Netbeans, and when simply added to a JavaFX scene, while in all those cases the CalendarPicker control does work. which leads me to believe it is a problem with the control itself and not my implementation. I checked the respective classes in the library and the code handling modeProperty seems identical.p  pThing is, the sample program including all controls on the JFXtras page a hrefhttpjfxtras.orgresourcesjavajfxtraslabssamples8.0r4SNAPSHOTshadow.jar relnofollowhttpjfxtras.orgresourcesjavajfxtraslabssamples8.0r4SNAPSHOTshadow.jara has a multiple selection working for the LocalDatePicker control. p  pWhat am I doing wrongp  pSorry if its an easy fix, Im pretty new to Java and JavaFXp  pThanksp

Below is my project structure.p  p1 lib folder  contains all the external JARs including    TestNG.jarp  p2 bin contains individual class filesp  p3 build.xml    file contains the ANT script for running the testing using TestNGp  p4 testng.xml file contains the class name to be run, referring to    the bin folderp  pI currently run the above setup without any issues, But I wanted to JAR the class files in the bin folder and run it. I created a JAR using all the class files in the bin folder and replaced the class files with the newly created JAR. But this gives me class not found in the classpath exception.p  pthe only change I did was I created a JAR using all the class files in the bin folder and used it instead of the class files.p  pI could not figure out how to call the class file present in the JAR using my testng.xml file.p  pbelow is my tesng.xml file structure,p  precodeltsuite nameStockFunctionalStory77 parallelnonegt   lttest nameTestgt     ltclassesgt         ltclass namepack01.TestStock01gt     ltclassesgt   lttestgt ltsuitegt lt Suite gt codepre  pwhere pack01 is my package and TestStock01 is my test class.

Negative 1873 pWhen using various APIs that have variable size structures structures that must be allocated as byte[] and then cast into the struct, it would be nice if the uniqueptr holder could point to the structure, since thats what well be using.p  pExamplep  precodestduniqueptrltVARIABLESIZESTRUCT[]gt v  v.resetreinterpretcastltVARIABLESIZESTRUCTgtnew BYTE[bytesRequired] codepre  pThis allowed v to provide the view to the structure itself, which is preferable because that we dont need a second variable and we dont care about the byte pointer except for deletion.p  pThe problem comes in with the possibility of thunking the pointer on the cast making it unsafe to free. I see no reasonable reason why the compiler would change the pointer value on cast since theres no inheritance, but I hear that the standard reserves the right to thunk any pointer on any cast, so as far as standardcompliant coding goes, this approach is out the window, right Or is there some reason it is safe Is there a way to at least staticassert this, or some other way to make it safe or cleanly deal with this type of structurep

Negative 1873 pI need to calculate some MD5 of very large files 1TB for deduplication purposes. For example, I have a 10GiB file and want to simultaneously calculate the MD5 of the whole file and of each of the 10 sequential 1GiB chunks.p  pI cannot use the formp  precodeDigestMD5.hexdigestIO.readfile10GiB.txt codepre  pbecause Ruby first reads the whole file in memory before calculating the MD5, so I quickly run out of memory.p  pSo I can read it in 1MiB chunks with the following code.p  precoderequire digest  fd  File.openfile10GiB.txt digest1GiB  DigestMD5.new digest10GiB  DigestMD5.new 10.times do   1024.times do     data1MiB  fd.read220  Each MiB is read only once so      digest1GiB ltlt data1MiB    there is no duplicate IO operations.     digest10GiB ltlt data1MiB   It is then sent to both digests.   end   puts digest1GiB.hexdigest   digest1GiB.reset end puts digest10GiB.hexdigest codepre  pThat takes around 40 seconds. The results are similar using codeopensslcode instead of codedigestcode.p  pIf I comment out codedigest1GiB ltlt data1MiBcode or codedigest10GiB ltlt data1MiBcode, it unsurprisingly goes twice as fast 20 seconds and the bash command codemd5sum file10GiB.txtcode takes around 20 seconds, so that is consistent.p  pClearly both MD5s are being calculated in the same thread and core so I thought I could use some multithreading. Im using Ruby MRI 2.2.1 that doesnt have real multithreading but using subprocesses I can calculate the MD5s on several cores simultaneouslyp  precodefd  File.openfile10GiB.txt IO.popenmd5sum, r do md5sum10GiB   10.times do     IO.popenmd5sum, r do md5sum1GiB       1024.times do         data1MiB  fd.read220  Each MiB is read only once so          md5sum1GiB ltlt data1MiB    there is no duplicate IO operations.         md5sum10GiB ltlt data1MiB   It is then sent to both digests.       end       md5sum1GiB.closewrite       puts md5sum1GiB.gets     end   end   md5sum10GiB.closewrite   puts md5sum10GiB.gets end codepre  pBut this takes 120 seconds, three times slower. Why would that bep  pStrangely, if I comment out codemd5sum1GiB ltlt data1MiBcode or codemd5sum10GiB ltlt data1MiBcode it doesnt take 60 seconds as expected, but 40, which is still half of the theoretical speed.p  pThe results are similar using codeOpen3popen2code instead of codeIOpopencode. Same for codeopenssl md5code instead of codemd5sumcode.p  pI have confirmed the speed differences of those pieces of code with significantly larger files to make sure it wasnt insignificant measurement errors and the proportions stay the same.p  pI have very fast IO storage with about 2.5GiBs sequential read so I dont think it could cause any limitations here.p

Negative 1873 pIm reading the book CLR via C 4th edition, not as a newcomer to C but as someone who knows the language trying to improve my grasp on the underlying functionality of the CLR.p  pAnyway, in this book an example is given pg127131 when discussing boxingunboxing of value types which ends with a call to Console.WriteLine with a value type being concatenated to a string being passed as the argument.p  pThe book explains that boxing and unboxingcopy operations cause overhead, which I already knew, but it then stated that the example could be optimized by running .ToString on the value type being passed in.p  pI created an example program and compiled it, then used ILDASM to inspect the IL it generated. The version with ToString essentially is identical, but replaces the box instruction with a call to ToString no shock there.p  pI benchmarked the code in a loop of 100000 runs, and there was no difference it fluctuated which one was faster. I realize that other factors come into play when benchmarking caches, etc., but by the way the book explained it I had expected to see a significant difference when avoiding the box instruction even in a naieve benchmark..p  pIs it just that calling a function isnt much better Is there a boxing operation going on in the ToString that nullifies the benefits and the book is wrong Can someone shed some light on thisp  pFor reference, here are the two ILDASM readoutsp  hr  precode.method private hidebysig static void  Mainstring[] args cil managed    .entrypoint    Code size       24 0x18   .maxstack  2   .locals init int32 V0   IL0000  ldc.i4.4   IL0001  stloc.0   IL0002  ldloc.0   IL0003  box        [mscorlib]System.Int32   IL0008  ldstr      .

Negative 1873 pIm having a problem in Prolog. Im trying to write a converter that converts simple english sentences into commands in Prolog. Im trying to create a text adventure game using the tutorial a hrefhttpwww.amzi.comAdventureInProloga15nlang.php relnofollowherea.p  pMy problem is this After starting the main command loop, when entering a sentence and hitting the enter button, Prolog will simply jump into the next line, seemingly not executing the command at all. It does not matter how often I enter a fullstop. Before using this language converter, everything worked just fine and the game was playable using commands. The problem must be within this part of the code. More precisely, I think the part for reading lines or the codegetcommandXcode function are most likely not working. Im using SWIPolog by the way, in case that is of importance some people add this info to their questions. Since I cant spot the mistake myself, I will try to post the relevant code.p  pFirst the main command loopp  precodecommandloop    writeWelcome to Nani Search, nl,   look,nl,   repeat,   writegtnanigt ,   getcommandX,   doX, nl,   endconditionX. codepre  pAnd now the converter the codegetcommandXcode function is at the very bottomp  precode Natural language converter  command[V], InList verbV, InList[].  verblook, [lookX]X. verblook, [look,aroundX]X. verblook, [glotz,ma,aldeX]X. verblistpossessions, [inventoryX]X. verbend, [endX]X. verbend, [quitX]X. verbend, [good,byeX]X.  command[V,O], InList    verbObjectType, V, InListS1,   objectObjectType, O, S1[].  verbplace, goto, [go,toX]X. verbplace, goto, [goX]X. verbplace, goto, [move,toX]X.

It is supposed to work like this When you enter codego to the office.code the converter is supposed to transform the frase into the command codegotoofficecode. When one writes codetake the flashlightcode it is supposed to convert it to codetakeflashlightcode . When one writes codelook aroundcode. it should be converted to codelookcode. The converted command should then be send to the command loop and be executed via doX As seen in the dofunction, X must be command like codegotoofficecode. I hope it is clear what my question is.p  pI also made a trace. The command loop is being started normally. This is what happens after the end of the command loop the codewritegtnanigt code still being part of it.p  precode Call 7 writegtnanigt   creep gtnanigt     Exit 7 writegtnanigt   creep    Call 7 getcommandG3903  creep    Call 8 readlistG3903  creep    Call 9 writegt   creep gt     Exit 9 writegt   creep    Call 9 readlineG3903  creep    Call 10 get0G3903  creep   codepre  pThen Im able to enter a new command. By simply pressing the Enter button without giving any input, it will always do the followingp  precode   Exit 10 get010  creep    Call 10 buildlist10, G3904  creep    Call 11 get0G3906  creep   codepre  pThis is being repeated whenever I hit enter. When I enter a random letter or multiple letters before pressing enter, the value of the first get0 will change, but nothing else.p  pDepending on which letters I write there sometimes is a different result though. Here are two examples For example when I try writing emdsfem, this will happenp  precode dsf     Exit 10 get0100  skip    Call 10 buildlist100, G3904  fail    Fail 9 readlineG3903  creep    Fail 8 readlistG3903  creep    Redo 7 getcommandG3903  creep    Call 8 writeI dont understand  creep I dont understand    Exit 8 writeI dont understand  creep    Call 8 nl  creep    Exit 8 nl  creep    Call 8 fail  creep    Fail 8 fail  creep    Fail 7 getcommandG3903  creep    Redo 7 repeat  creep    Exit 7 repeat  creep    Call 7 writegtnanigt   creep gtnanigt     Exit 7 writegtnanigt   creep    Call 7 getcommandG3903  creep    Call 8 readlistG3903  creep    Call 9 writegt   creep gt     Exit 9 writegt   creep    Call 9 readlineG3903  creep    Call 10 get0G3903  creep   codepre  pOther input like emapgem will have the following resultp  precode apg  Exit 17 get097  print    Exit 17 get097  goals  [17] get097  [16] buildlist10, [10G3915]  [15] buildlist10, [10, 10G3915]  [14] buildlist10, [10, 10, 10G3915]  [13] buildlist10, [10, 10, 10, 10G3915]    Exit 17 get097  creep    Call 17 buildlist97, G3915  creep    Call 18 get0G3927  creep codepre  pAnd when entering longer commands, random or also something like codego to the office.code, the program will shut down completely, without a comment. This shutdown only happens while the trace is activated. When it is not, commands like codego to the office.code will, again, simply make the program jump to the next line, seemingly not doing anything. What might also be interesting is the fact that, after starting the command loop, the program takes a long time to shut down. The following message is being displayedp  precodeWaiting for Prolog. Close again to force termination .. codepre  pSince Im really new to Prolog, Im not quite sure how to interpret this. To me the reaction to the random letters as input is competely random. Maybe someone else has a clue.p  pI would apreciate it a lot, if someone could help me out. I hope its not too big of a mistake.p  pRegards p

Negative 1873 pMore recently I have started to see some Project Management applications providing a strongTimerstrong functionbutton on a Task.p  pThe user can click to start the timer and it will record elapsed time and save to backend for that Task record.p  pThe main reason I have never tried to add this functionality into my Project Management app that I am currently building is due to the fact, as soon as the user browses to another page in the app or web, there JavaScript Timer becomes uselessp  pOne way I have seen some apps tackle this issue is by having every page in the app load using AJAX so that they can have a Timer Bar across the bottom of the screen which will remain there even as they navigate inside the PM app.p  pThis seems like a pretty good method however in my situation I cannot do that.  My Project Management app is a SugarCRM module so I cannot change how the main app flow works.p  pSo my question is, what are some reliable ways to implement Task Timers in a PM appp  pI would assume that it might would have to work together with PHP to somewhat stay in sync between the frontend JavaScript Timer and the backend.  p  pFor instance, say you have a Timer running on a Task for a few minutes and then you navigate away from the app.  1 hour later you load the PM app, it would be nice if the JavaScript timer would use the backend start timer time and calculate the elapsed time and then have the JavaScript timer simply start off from where it would have been if you had stayed in the App the whole past hourp  pTo clarifyp  ul liYou load PM app and start timer.  It counts up to code000300codeli liYou navigate away from the app or even close it.li liYou come back and load the app 1 hour later.li liTHe JavaScript Timer would then start showing code010300code and counting up from that value.  li ul  pDoes this sound feasible evenp

In fact, I can, using codevcode, even see that its fields are of course named codeNcode and codeEcode.p  pMy problem is that I dont know a better way to make Go believe that this is in fact an codersa.PublicKeycode than to extract each of those numbers into strings with codefmt.Sscancode, and then convert into codebig.Intcode and codeintcode, respectively, and then use those two values I just got as the modulus and exponent to create a new codersa.PublicKeycode.p  pThat works, but seems incredibly nasty.  I get that since its unexported, theres probably no direct route, but surely theres a better way to get the fields than by reconverting their printable representations.p  pcodessh.PublicKeycode does have a codeMarshalcode function, but that gives me the wireformat representation, and if I go through there, well, I guess it avoids abusing the type system, but Id just end up writing my own bytestreamtobigInttoRSA converter there, which doesnt seem like it really helps.  At that point I might just as well start with the codeauthorizedkeyscode file and parse it myself, and that seems dumb too.p  pWhats the right way to do thisp

Perhaps someone can help.p  pLinearp  precodedfNULL yNULL extraNULL xc5,10,25,50,100,250,500,1000 dfdata.framex df k1 y5x15rnorm8,0,101000 dfltcbinddf,y whileklt15    extraNULL   kk1   y5x15rnorm8,0,101000   extradata.framex   extracbindextra,y   dfrbinddf,extra  codepre  pLinear with weighting but too muchp  precodedfwNULL yNULL xc5,10,25,50,100,250,500,1000 dfwdata.framex dfw k1 y5xxrnorm8,0,11000 dfwltcbinddfw,y whileklt15    extraNULL   kk1   y5xxrnorm8,0,11000   extradata.framex   extracbindextra,y   dfwrbinddfw,extra  codepre  pQuadraticp  precodedfqNULL yNULL xc5,10,25,50,100,250,500,1000 dfqdata.framex dfq k1 y0.025x23x20rnorm8,0,101000 dfqltcbinddfq,y whileklt15    extraNULL   kk1   y0.025x23x20rnorm8,0,101000   extradata.framex   extracbindextra,y   dfqltrbinddfq,extra  codepre  pand finally Quadratic with weightingp  precodedfqwNULL yNULL xc5,10,25,50,100,250,500,1000 dfqwdata.framex dfqw k1 y0.025x23xxrnorm8,0,31000 dfqwltcbinddfqw,y whileklt15    extraNULL   kk1   y0.025x23xxrnorm8,0,31000   extradata.framex   extracbindextra,y   dfqwrbinddfqw,extra  codepre

Negative 1873 pI am new to rabbitMq and Spring AMQP . I am building a new project from scratch . Here for one of the components we are using rabbitMq as message broker .p  pIn this project ,primarily all the development has been happening in Java . We are using Spring in general for some of the components  .p  pNow , rabbitmq though written in Erlang does provide a clean java Api. There is also spring amqp which provides a nice interface  to support loose coupling through AMQPTemplate etc. .p  pOne advantage which I thought of using SpringAMQP is that because of above mentioned loose coupling , tomorrow if we have to use any other implementation of AMQP than rabbitMqspringrabbit  I dont have to change my code . But as I see ,today the implementation is for rabbitMq and barring extraordinary circumstances , I dont see anything happening here. We should be using rabbitMq for near foreseeable future and also not sure if there is any other message broker implementation thought at spring amqp side other than rabbitMq.p  pThe disadvantage I think is that I am well away off understanding the actual client API RabbitMq provides due to the abstraction Spring AMQP givesunless I decide to dig really deep .p  pIn such a case , is there any other advantage SPRING AMQP provides over traditional rabbitMq Java API p  pThanks p

Negative 1873 pIm making a data form and part of it requires that it have a button to add another row of questions and another button to delete its corresponding row. Hopefully Ive just overlooked something and its a simple fix, but if I have to reorganize any code I will. The problem Im having is that when you click Add Stack it adds a new row of questions exactly like its supposed to, but when you click Delete Stack nothing happens. From various methods of debugging Ive found that the problem stems from the fact that the delete button is generated, and if I were to put a row that loads initially with the page it works just like its supposed to. I would also like to point out that for the purposes of debugging the delete button just prints test to the console instead of actually deleting a row.p  pThe relevant files are as followingp  h1app.jsh1  precodeglobal angular  var app app  angular.moduleapp, [ngRoute]  app.config[routeProvider, function routeProvider      use strict      routeProvider.when,          templateUrl htmlhome.html     .otherwise         redirectTo        ]  app.controllerMainController, function scope, http      use strict      http.getjsondata.json.thenfunction response          scope.data  response.data           scope.change  function item          return item  changed        app.directiveremoveStackButton, function      return          link functionscope, element              scope.removeStack  function                  console.logtest                              app.directiveaddStackButton, [http, functionhttp      return          link functionscope, element              scope.addStack  function                  http.gethtmlstack.html.thenfunction response                      var row  compileresponse.datascope                     element.parent.parent.prependrow                                             ] codepre  phrp  h1stack.htmlh1  precodeltdiv classformgroupgt     ltdiv classformgroupgt         ltdiv classrowgt             ltdiv classcolxs4gt                 ltlabel forstackstotesgtTotesltlabelgt                 ltselect namestackstotes[] classformcontrolgt                     ltoption value0 selectedselectedgt0ltoptiongt                     ltoption value1gt1ltoptiongt                     ltoption value2gt2ltoptiongt                     ltoption value3gt3ltoptiongt                     ltoption value4gt4ltoptiongt                     ltoption value5gt5ltoptiongt                     ltoption value6gt6ltoptiongt                 ltselectgt             ltdivgt             ltdiv classcolxs4gt                 ltlabel forcappedstackgtCapltlabelgt                 ltselect namecappedstack[] classformcontrolgt                     ltoption value0 selectedselectedgtNo capltoptiongt                     ltoption value1gtCap wo litterltoptiongt                     ltoption value2gtCap w litterltoptiongt                 ltselectgt             ltdivgt             ltdiv classcolxs4gt                 ltlabel forcapheightgtCap heightltlabelgt                 ltselect namecapheight[] classformcontrolgt                     ltoption value0 selectedselectedgtNo capltoptiongt                     ltoption value1gt1ltoptiongt                     ltoption value2gt2ltoptiongt                     ltoption value3gt3ltoptiongt                     ltoption value4gt4ltoptiongt                     ltoption value5gt5ltoptiongt                     ltoption value6gt6ltoptiongt                 ltselectgt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt     ltdivgt     ltdiv classformgroupgt         ltdiv classrowgt             ltdiv classcolxs12gt                 ltbutton classbtn btndanger btnblock btnsm ngscope removestackbutton ngclickremoveStackgtDelete Stackltbuttongt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt     ltdivgt     lthrgt ltdivgt codepre  phrp  h1home.htmlh1  precodeltdivgt     ltformgt         ltfieldsetgt             ltlegendgtStacksltlegendgt             ltdiv classformgroupgt                 ltdiv classformgroupgt                     ltbutton classbtn btnblock addstackbutton ngclickaddStackgtAdd Stackltbuttongt                 ltdivgt             ltdivgt         ltfieldsetgt     ltformgt ltdivgt codepre  phrp  h1index.htmlh1  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtml ngappappgt  ltheadgt     ltmeta charsetutf8gt     ltmeta httpequivXUACompatible contentIEedgegt     ltmeta nameviewport contentwidthdevicewidth, initialscale1, maximumscale1, userscalablenogt     ltlink relstylesheet hrefvendorbootstrap3.3.5distcssbootstrap.min.css gt     ltscript typetextjavascript srcvendorjquery2.1.4jquery2.1.4.min.jsgtltscriptgt     ltscript typetextjavascript srcvendorbootstrap3.3.5distjsbootstrap.min.jsgtltscriptgt     ltscript typetextjavascript srcvendorangular1.4.4angular.min.jsgtltscriptgt     ltscript typetextjavascript srcvendorangular1.4.4angularroute.min.jsgtltscriptgt     ltscript typetextjavascript srcjsapp.jsgtltscriptgt     lt HTML5 shim and Respond.js for IE8 support of HTML5 elements and media queries gt     lt[if lt IE 9]gt       ltscript srchttpsoss.maxcdn.comhtml5shiv3.7.2html5shiv.min.jsgtltscriptgt       ltscript srchttpsoss.maxcdn.comrespond1.4.2respond.min.jsgtltscriptgt     lt[endif]gt ltheadgt   ltbody ngcontrollerMainControllergt      ltnginclude srchtmlnavbar.htmlgtltngincludegt     ltngviewgtltngviewgt ltbodygt codepre
