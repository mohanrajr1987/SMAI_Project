Positive 67719 pI have a Pandas DataFrame that contains duplicate entries. Some items are also listed twice or three times. I would like to filter it so that it only shows items that are listed at least n times. In the final table all items should only be shown once. The DataFrame contains 3 columns [colA, colB, colC]. It should only consider colB in determining whether the item is listed multiple times. Note this is not dropduplicates. Its the opposite, I would like to drop items that are in the dataframe less than n times.p

Negative 67719 pI have read the information provided on the a hrefhttpphp.netmanualenfunction.crypt.phpPHP Manual Entry for codecryptcodea, but I find myself still unsure of the format for a salt to trigger the Blowfish algorithm.p  pAccording manual entry, I should use 2 or 2a as the start of a 16 character string.  However, in the example given later, they use a much longer string code2a07usesomesillystringforsaltcode, which indicates to me that whatever string I provide will be sliced and diced to fit the model.p  pThe problem I am encountering is actually triggering the Blowfish algo vs codeSTDDEScode.  Examplep  precodefoo  foo salt  2a . hashwhirlpool, foo  128 characters, will be truncated hash  cryptfoo, salt   hash  26HdMTpoODt6 codepre  pThat hash is obviously not whirlpool, and is in fact codeSTDDEScode with only the first two characters of the salt being used for the salt.  However, in the PHP Manuals example, their salt starts with code2a07code, so if I add those three characters to the same code I get the followingp  precodefoo  foo salt  2a . hashwhirlpool, foo  128 characters, will be truncated hash  cryptfoo, salt   hash  2a07b1b2ee48991281a439da2OHi1vZF8Z2zIA.8njYZKR.9iBehxLoIC codepre  pIve noticed I can provide some variance in the characters which are here shown as code07code, for example code04code and code15code both work, but code01code through code03code dont work generates a blank string, and values such as code99code and code85code cause it to revert to codeSTDDEScode again.p  h2The Questionh2  pWhat is the significance of those three characters following the code2acode string which, as I am lead to believe by the manual, instruct the crypt function to use the blowfish method.  p  pAccording to the manual, code2acode should be enough to instruct codecryptcode to use the blowfish method what, then, is the significance of the following three characters  What then, is the correct format for a salt, if these three characters are so significantp

Negative 67719 pMy site is here a hrefhttptreethink.com relnofollowhttptreethink.comap  pWhat I have going is a news ticker on the right that is inside a jquery function. The function starts right away and extracts the news ticker and then retracts it as it should. When a navigation it adds a class to the div, which the function then checks for to see if it should stop extractingretracting. This all works great. p  pThe problem I am having is that after the close button is clicked in the content window, the removeClass wont work. This means that it keeps thinking the window is open and therefore the conditional statement inside the function wont let it extract and retract again. With a simple firebug check, its showing that the class isnt being removed period. p  pIts not the cboxClose id that its not finding because I tried changing that to just a tags in general and it still wouldnt work so its something to do with the jQuery for sure.

Negative 67719 pIm developing a REST webservice Java, Jersey. The people Im doing this for want to directly access the webservice via Javascript. Some instinct tells me this is not a good idea, but I cannot really explain that instinct. My natural approach would have been to have the webservice do the real logic and database access, but also have some relatively thin serverside script layer e.g. in PHP. Clients would talk to the PHP layer which in turn would talk to the webservice. The webservice would be pretty local to the apachePHP server and implicitly trust calls from the script layer. The script layer would take care of session management. Btw, I am not talking about just hiding the webservice behind an Apache which simply redirects calls.p  pBut as I find myself at a lack of wordsarguments to explain my instinct, I wonder whether my instinct is right  note that while I have been developing all kinds of software in all kinds of languages and frameworks for like 17 years, this is the first time I develop a webservice.p  pstrongSo my question is basically what are your opinions Are there any standard setups Is my instinct totally wrong Or partially Pstrong p  pMany thanks,p  pMaxp  pPS I might add a few bits of information about the planned usage of the whole applicationp  ul liwill be accessed by different kinds of users, partly general public, partly privilegedli lithus, all major OSbrowser combinations can be expected as clientsli lihowever, writing the client is not my responsibilityli liwill potentially have very high loadtrafficli lilogic of webservice will later be massively expanded for another product which is basically a superset of the functionality of the current projectli lithere is a significant likelihood that at some point an API should be exposed which can be used by 3rd party developers  obviously, with some restrictionsli liat some point, the public view of the product should become accessible via smartphones, too in other words, maybe a customized version of the site to adapt to the smaller display and different input methodsli ul

Or is this the only way to do it and I have to manually call codeSession.Deletecode on the box in order to remove itp

Negative 67719 pIve been using MVC to reimplement an application that I once built using WebForms.  What Ive noticed is the followp  ol lipMVC works really well for simple pages, pages that dont require large amounts of state to be maintained between requests.  If the page requires any sophistication, then the purity of pages adherence to MVC quickly becomes a leaky abstraction and creates a very tight coupling between the View implementation and the controller.  My understanding of MVC is that there is a single controller that should be able to handle multiple views of a given model with very clear and clean separations between the two.pli lipAnother point of friction Im seeing is that MVC implies that the business rules be enforced through the design of the modelwhich I love.  However as I build my application I soon see that validation should live clientside as wellif for nothing other than the user experience of avoiding multiple posts.  To me this seems another adulteration of the design pattern in that Im storing business logic not only in two places but two languages as wellpli ol  pThe issue I have is that while WebForms doesnt give me nearly the control over the UI rendering and markup that is afforded me in MVC, Im torn as to having to write metric gobs of code in the view to recreate the WebForm version of my application as well as deliver a similar user experience.p  pstrongSo when approaching UI design and implementing a solution, how should I think about solving the problem that differs from the classic WebForms approach  Also what is the MasonDixon linedoes it even exist where I should simply use WebForms to deliver the User Experience my users are looking for as easily as possible without creating a muddled MVCish applicationstrongp

Negative 67719 pUntil now I used a texture bitmapfont for font rendering, but Im trying to get freetype2 working. All my strings are SHIFTJIS encoded and my only Problem is now to get from freetype the right glyph to a proper SHIFTJIS bitsequence. But it seems harder than I expected. To example  has the charcode 0x889F byte 1 is set to 136 and byte 2 is 159  thats according to the SHIFTJIS encoding. So I called the functionp  precodeFTSelectCharmapface, FTENCODINGSJIS codepre  pand try then to load a glyph with that charcodep  precodeFTLoadCharface, 0x889F, FTLOADRENDER   codepre  pBut I receive some random glyph. It cant be a fontspecific problem, because I tried already different fonts with the same result and yeah, they provide a shiftjis charmap. To example 0 zero should be at position 0x0030  but its in fact at 0x002D. Not all characters have an constant offset of 3, otherwise there would be no problem... I think my FTLoadChar call, pass the charcode parameter in a wrong way  but cant guess how it would be right. Already triedp  precodeFTLoadCharface, FTGetCharIndexface, 0x889F, FTLOADRENDER   codepre  pBut then I receive another random glyph. So, how can I pass the charcode to FTLoadChar if not the default charmap is selectedp  pAny advice would be really helpful. Thank you.p

Amount of coding needed seems to be quite a lot too. p  pNeedsbr Fast live reportsbr Good graphic tools for visualizationbr Ability to drill down to specificsbr Online front end Minimize sending chunky reports through emails  p  pYes, I am almost asking for a miniBloomberg terminal, or something like Business Objects by SAP.  p  pCost wise hopefully not too much. Not looking into a 5 man IT support team, hopefully everything can be done by 1 guy. p  pAbout me I have strong background in using Excel for Business Analytics, reports, forms, automated population of fields, statistical studies, forecasting, scenario and model building, and optimization. But thats about it. I am willing to learn, but hopefully it would be a strong platform that withstands the ages.p

Negative 67719 pWe run a series of reports every 6 months and store the results to tables that can be queriedviewed at any time in the future.  Depending on the cycle either two or four tables will be added.  They have a standard naming convention of yyyymmmTablex.p  pOur website is built using ASP.Net MVC2 and the database is modeled using EF4 using the standard model designer, not Code First.p  pI would like to be able to dynamically add the report tables to the EF4 context at runtime.  I dont want to have to manually add them to the model using the designer, otherwise every reporting cycle we have to update and recompile the model just because we added the extra reports.  That would be a maintenance headache when nothing else has changed.p  pI can get a list of the available tables simply by querying sysobjects.  If I could get this list and add the tables to the context when the site started up then I could use something like the Dynamic LINQ library to query against them depending on which table the user selected from a dropdown.  p  pI cant use EF4s Code First out of the box because that would force me to create  concrete classes for the tables and that would just be the same maintenance headache.  I suspect I could use the same strategies the Code First framework uses to dynamically update the context, but I havent looked at this library at all and Im hoping someone familiar with it can point me in the right direction.p  pOtherwise I think I would have to drop back to ADO.Net to handle this area.  That may be the best and simple way so I guess Im looking for comments.  Im not a zealot so I dont need everything to be in LINQ and EF4.   But it would seem to be a little cleaner and consistent, especially if it allows me to make use of Dynamic LINQ.  But sometimes the old way is just simpler.p  pSo, if you have any suggestions or comments I would love to hear them.p  pThanksp

Negative 67719 pI am building a web application using a distrbuted NoSQL DB. However, for generating Ids for the new entities, I am using MySQL as a hrefhttpcode.flickr.comblog20100208ticketserversdistributeduniqueprimarykeysonthecheap relnofollowFlickrs ticket serverap  pI just stuck across an idea of keeping the stock of Ids at the application layer, so that newer entities may be easily allotted ids in a fast manner, without the need for fetching from DB, one by one, for each of them. Instead I can just pull a stock of Ids from the DB say around 1000, and use them uptil stack reaches a certain limit of remaining Ids, when Ill pull more of Ids from DB to fill the stack again.p  pYour ideas and thoughts upon this appreciated.p

Negative 67719 pFirst question here, so please forgive me if this seems obvious. Im having a bit of an issue working with the TIME datatype in my MySQL database and trying to find the best way to trim the leading zeros off the beginning of the time stamp.p  pTo be more specific, I have a songs table in my database, and in that table I have a songlength column. This column uses the Time datatype, so the presentation is always hhmmss.p  pIf my song is only 3 minutes and 42 seconds for example, Im hoping to have it display as simply 342, as opposed to 000342. Is there a built in PHP function perhaps similar to date to deal with something like thisp
Negative 67719 pI looking for the info that can help in estimating interrupt latencies on x86 CPUs. The very usefull paper was found at datasheets.chipdb.orgIntelx86386technote2153.pdf.  But this paper opened a very important question for me how can be defined the delay provided by waiting of completion of the current instruction I mean delay between recognition of the INTR signal and executing of INTR microcode. As I remember, the Intel Software developer manual also tells something about waiting of completion of the currently executing instruction. But it also tells something about that the some of the instructions can be interrupted in progress. And the main question is how the maximum completion instruction waiting length can be defined for the particular processor. Estimation in core ticks and memory access operations is needed, not in seconds or microseconds. The cache and TLD misses, and other such stuff that can influence to the waiting should be considered.p  pThis estimation is needed to investigate the possibility of implementing small critical sections that will not influence to the interrupt latency. To achive this the length of the critical section must be below or equal to the length of the most longest uninterruptable instruction of CPU.p  pAny kinds of help are very welcome. If you know some papers that can be helpfull, please, share the links to it.p
Negative 67719 pA few days ago I asked a very similar question. I was about returning valueserrors inside the application. I accept an answer to not return error as and object but throw an custom exceptions. Now, Im not exactly sure how to deal with it using WCF services. I wish the service will be as simple as it could be for client.p  pSpeaking very generally, my project looks like that  Client  WCF Service application  Database.p  pInside WCF app Ive got my own exception class, and it works fine. But lets say client want sth from db. My question is  What should I return to the client outside my app A. Complex type A value with meta data information about a possible error[1]. And when really unexpected error occurs throw an exception. B. Just a value when possible error occurs  throw an exception p  p[1]  invalid string format, cant connect to database or sth like that. I mean  If I know what the error exactly is  why throw an exception to client  Im not sure about that.  p

I get  codeerror value child is not a member of this.Nodecode from the codebindcode call.p  pIm not sure how to fix this, but I think it probably involves use of parameterized types. I need the type of codefcodes parameter to be that of the actual codeNodecode subclass assigned to codeschemacode.p  pstrongEDITstrong I can not explicitly name my codeNodecode subtypes, as in real life I have entire trees of statically defined codeNodecodes and it would not be practical to name them.p
Negative 67719 pI have a Java class that Im debating what I should make it into for my Android app. Im unsure whether I should make it an Activity, a View, or both.p  pThe reason I am unsure has to do with the it having constructors that have parameters, a component listener, and draws on the canvas. p  pTo be clear, when attempting to make it a View, I had issues with the constructor. If an activity, Im unsure how to interact between the two ie component resize, color changed, etc  perhaps with Intents So logically, maybe the best way is a mixture of a View and Activity. Im rather new to this thinking, so please keep that in mind.p  pIm wondering how those who have created a few Android Apps go about determining what your previous Java classes should be.

However, I would like a programbased solution, rather than having to tell users to do extra steps to avoid this.br It only copies the first row of data. If the data in the cell is a number, then it copies the data into every cell above it in that column, if it is text then it only goes up by one level.br An interesting note is that, if I alter the spreadsheet to say that all of the data is text, it then copies every cell as if they are numbers i.e. into every single cell above, rather than one single rowbrbrp  pAll in all this is rather irritating  since I dont have any luck when searching for this issue, I can only conclude that we are doing something wrong, or very few people have bothered with this type of test data.brbrp  p[edit] After some investigation I have made some headway in solving this  The provider assumes that your table of data begins with the uppermost, leftmost, nonblank cell on the specified worksheet httpsupport.microsoft.comdefault.aspxscidkbenus257819 . This is confirmed if I use a statement to select the entire worksheet  it only returns the block of data.br So when I select any cell that is outside of that range, the provider, rather than doing something sensible like returning null, returns the data from the uppermost nonempty cell from that particular column.br I could hypothetically change the system so that it simply grabs all of the data and assumes that the uppermost leftmost cell is cell A1, but that would break compatibility with data that is already out there.br What I now need is a way to get the cellreferences for the data that is returned, so I can treat it appropriately, or a way to force this to no longer happen.p

Negative 67719 pWere currently using Salesforce for our sales process, which involve trying to get people to sign up to our accounts management system, submit details, documents, and get reviewed by an admin. This is a whole PHP system outside of SF, lets call it Cherry.p  pWhat were doing right now is Cherry keeps track of the accounts, but everything that happens is sent to SalesForce, so our salespeople have the list of leads to contact. When anything changes in Cherry, things get updated in SalesForce, including converting the SF Lead to an Account when the customer gets reviewed by our admins in Cherry. After this we still update SF data, but this is less critical, since this is already a customer nowp  pTo send information from Cherry to SF, Im simply using the SforceEnterpriseClient.php API library, and calling the CreateUpdateDelete methods provided by that library. I dont know if theres any other way to be honest, but our needs are emveryem simple. Just creating Leads, updating their fields, and converting them to Account.p  pMy problem is that our salespeople want to use timedependent workflows, to automatically email the leads every few days, change them from one status to another, etc. However, once a Lead gets taken by one of these workflows, the record is locked until the time the action is executed, which is typically many days, and anything I try to do with it through the API update it, or particularly convertlead fails with error RECORDINUSEBYWORKFLOW.p  pNow, this seems like a pretty common scenario both using the API to update records, and using timedependent workflow. In fact, it almost seems to our salespeople that the whole point of using SalesForce is the workflows, so Im quite surprised something as basic as this fails...p  pSo the basic question is....  Is there any obvious way around this problem Using some other API Doing something different with the workflowsbr  If not, is there any way to detach a Lead from its workflow or somehow unlock that recordbr  If not, are there any workarounds that imply more programming on the SalesForce side  p  pThank you VERY much for your help Danielp

Negative 67719 pIve created a view which outputs a particular content type into a jCarousel.p  pOne of my fields is a background colour and I want to use this value for the actual background colour of the codelicode element in my jCarousel. The next is an image and I want this image to be wrapped in a div that I can lay out correctly within the same codelicode of the carousel.p  pSo, this carousel will have a customisable image and background colour for each member of the content type.p  pThe problem is, in jCarousel, the fields are just dumped into an array haphazardly, so I cannot output different fields in different ways. Ideally, what Id like to happen is in the codejcarouselview.tpl.phpcode Id like to output coderows[0][backgroundcolor]code into my custom html codedivcode tags and then coderows[0][image]code output into my own custom classed codedivcode tags also  obviously iterated within a loop to apply the individual settings to each element.br However, the current set up is that rows[0] dumps both fields into their default styles and I cant access individual fields.p  pNow, is this something I can control in Views Or do I need to do some custom hacking to get this to workp

Negative 67719 h2EDIT Please note that I am appending my original question with my actual question due to realizing that I asked the wrong question by forgetting what I actually meant to ask.h2  pIn PHP 5.4 as of RC1, it is possible to access class methods on class instantiation.p  pIn other words, as I understand it, it is now possible to do codefoo  new bargtfoobarcode which saves times and lines of code.p  pFor my question, lets look at the following examplep  precodeclass foo      function construct            function bar          return world        foobar  new foogtbar echo foobar codepre  pMy question is, in such a case, when both the constructor and the method that is called upon initialization return a value, what is output by the final line i.e. codeecho foobarcode p  pIf I had to guess, since I havent actually had a chance to play around with 5.4 yet, the return from foobar would overwrite the return from fooconstruct because it is returned last. But I just wanted to check.p  hr  pOkay, so the above question is not even logical since construct should not return. What I really meant to ask is this Does foobar in the above example contain the class instance or the return from bar If the latter, what sense does it make to use this if the class will not be available after instantiated Wouldnt it be better to just use a static method or call the method on its own linep

Negative 67719 pApologies if this is a silly question, but Ive done some googling and searched SO and havent found anyone asking this exact question.  p  pI have been doing iOS development for some time now, but I am completely new to the Interface Builder.  What I want to know is this is there any way to just create ONE .xib file and then use it for both iPhone and iPad in a Universal application  p  pIt seems silly to me to have to create them separately why do twice the work laying something out more than once in Interface Builder when I could do it once with minor adjustments for screen size in codep  pPlease let me know if Im missingmisunderstanding something here.  Like I said, Im a complete Interface Builder newbie   p  pEDIT I have submitted noninterfacebuilder games to the App Store in the past where the iPhone and iPad versions were identical, so Im not concerned with making the game lookfeel different on each device. I intend for them to look exactly the same, aside from some slight positioning changes due to the difference in aspect ratio.p

This seems a bit clunky though.p  pThanks,p  pGordonp

Negative 67719 pI have inherited a project originally written for Win95 which has a number of buttons attached to a parent window derived from CWnd. The buttons themselves are in a userdefined class derived from CWnd, so they are not real buttons, but little windows that are defined by gazillions of lines of code, and have a ton of display issues that Ive been sweating over for several weeks, with no resolution in sight.p  pWe concluded the other day that CBitmapButton looked like a great alternative. Appears simple, define 4 bitmaps for the different button states. About all I need is BNCLICKED to fire up a handler, and Id be golden.p  pAfter messing around with this for a while, setting up a button and some bitmaps, I was able to display the CBitmapButton didnt look great, but I can fix that... the problem NOW is that I attempted to set up a message map to capture the BNCLICKED message, but since the parent window is derived from CWnd instead of CDialog, I get syntax errors setting up the message map. Read the MSDNs on the subject a few times over, and it appears you can only hook up a CBitmapButton to a CDialogderived class. This seems pretty weird to me  I just want a button, and it should be able to transmit a simple I was clicked to whatever parent its attached to, but apparently not destined to happen.p  pSo, has anyone successfully attached a CBitmapButton to a CWndderived parent and if so how does one set up a message map that will work with these things Alternatively, what approach would you use to set up a button class that WOULD work with a CWnd parent, since CBitmapButton and CButton seem to require CDialogs as parentsp

Negative 67719 pIm trying to create a script that, based on an input codeacode creates an array of all the combinations and permutations of all words containing an codeacode and two other characters from the alphabet. Values are such as codeacode, codeabcode, codebacode, codedabcode, codebgacode etc  as you may see the array contains or should contain a weird amount of values.p  pThe problem is that the functions I use in the script outputs even more values with many duplicates. And for some reason I can not create a flattened array without duplicates. I tried to use codearrayuniquecode but it doesnt work here. I tried to use codeexplodecode and codeimplodecode to flatten the result array, but no success. Even if I succeed to create a string from the values, when I try to transform this string into an array, the result is again the actual multidimensional array.p  pThis drives me crazy, and as you see the code, Im a beginner in PHP.p  pAny help to transform the actual multidimensional array to a flattened one without duplicates is highly appreciated. An example actually the array contains 12168 subarrays, and only the string codeacode occurs 1456 times.

Negative 67719 pI am working on documenting a new and expanded Lua API for the game Bitfighter httpbitfighter.org.  Our Lua object model is a subset of the C object model, and the methods exposed to Lua that I need to document are a subset of the methods available in C.  I want to document only the items relevant to Lua, and ignore the rest.p  pFor example, the object BfObject is the root of all the Lua objects, but is itself in the middle of the C object tree.  BfObject has about 40 C methods, of which about 10 are relevant to Lua scripters.  I wish to have our documentation show BfObject as the root object, and show only those 10 relevant methods.  We would also need to show its children objects in a way that made the inheritance of methods clear.p  pFor the moment we can assume that all the code is written in C.p  pOne idea would be to somehow mark the objects we want to document in a way that a system such as doxygen would know what to look at and ignore the rest.  Another would be to preprocess the C code in such a way as to delete all the nonrelevant bits, and document what remains with something like doxygen.  I actually got pretty far with this approach using luadoc, but could not find a way to make luadoc show object hierarchy.  p  pOne thing that might prove helpful is that every Lua object class is registered in a consistent manner, along with its parent class.p  pThere are a growing number of games out there that use Lua for scripting, and many of them have decent documentation.  Does anyone have a good suggestion on how to produce itp  hr  pPS To clarify, Im happy to use any tool that will do the job  doxygen and luadoc are just examples that I am somewhat familiar with.p

Negative 67719 pFor my CS11 class, I have to write a small applet that draws a horizontal and vertical line on the screen that intersect in the middle of the canvas. One part of the assignment is to be able to move one or both lines when the user clicks on a line and performs a drag. That part is working.p  pThe second part involves handling window resizing. If the window gets resized, the two lines need to be adjusted so they extend from edge to edge of the window.p  pOur instructions want us to use the Java appletviewer instead of a web browser to launch the program so that the window can be resized while the program is running. We are told to use the following .html file.p  pResizableBallController.htmlp  precodelthtmlgt   ltbodygt     ltapplet       codeResizableBallController.class       archiveobjectdraw.jar       width500       height500gt     ltappletgt   ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pWhen I run the program and resize the window the canvas area stays fixed at 500x500 pixels, even as I make the window bigger, and the enlarged area is filled with gray. According to my instructor, the canvas should automatically adjust to extend from edge to edge of the newly resized window.p  pTo test the issue, I am overloading the codepaintcode method to add a codeSystem.out.printlncode message so I can see how often it is being called and it appears the only time the method is invoked is when the program is launched.p  pIm wondering if this could have something to do with Awesome Window Manager or perhaps something else. I say this because the instructor said when you resize the window, the canvas should automatically resize as well.p  pHere is a portion of the code so you can see what Im doingp  precodeimport objectdraw. import java.awt.  public class ResizableBallController extends WindowController     Canvas separators   private Line xAxis,                yAxis   boolean xAxisGrabbed,           yAxisGrabbed    public void begin        int canvasWidth               canvas.getWidth,         canvasHeight              canvas.getHeight,         canvasHorizontalMidPoint  canvasWidth  2,         canvasVerticalMidpoint    canvasHeight  2      xAxis  new Line0, canvasVerticalMidpoint,                      canvasWidth, canvasVerticalMidpoint,                      canvas      yAxis  new LinecanvasHorizontalMidPoint, 0,                      canvasHorizontalMidPoint, canvasHeight,                      canvas       public void onMousePressLocation p        xAxisGrabbed  xAxis.containsp     yAxisGrabbed  yAxis.containsp       public void onMouseDragLocation p        if xAxisGrabbed            xAxis.moveTo0, p.getY           if yAxisGrabbed            yAxis.moveTop.getX, 0            public void paintjava.awt.Graphics g        super.paintg     System.out.printlnpaint called      End of public class ResizableBallController extends WindowController codepre
Negative 67719 pI have a website that uses Amazon Web ServicesAWS infrastructure. I wrote the entire back end code in java myself and have a front end as well. I have been advised to use Alfresco as public cloud backend to reduce development effort and quickly go to market. The web app is in java and uses struts with jQuery and javascript as front end components. I have the following questions p  ol lipAlfresco has a war file by itself. Im kinda newbie to these things but how do i run two wars and connect the front end to Alfresco in the Tomcat server Is that possible between, virtually, the two appspli lipIf i can separate the front end cleanly from backend of my existing app, how do i integrate it with Alfresco Does the parameters for each of the struts Actions execute method sufficient for getting access to Alfresco or do i have to do something else I know about CMIS and REST api calls but dont know which to choose. Does it work in an environment where there are two war filesAlfresco and my front end running as two apps in Tomcatpli lipI use the website for storing documents. Do i have to keep my existing metadata table for documents or does Alfresco provide one such option without bandwidth and call overhead in AWSpli lipIs Alfresco SDK for community or enterprise edition same as Cloud API onepli ol  pI need to integrate my own front end to Alfresco because it has unique capabilities not found in Alfresco. Using scripting capability in Alfresco is not an option for me. I prefer asking these questions on Stack Overflow because i think i can get better answers than in Alfresco forums. I appreciate your thoughts.p

Negative 67719 pI want to send emails asynchronously for faster and lighter http responses, but Im struggling with many new concepts.p  pFor example, the documentation talks about a hrefhttpsymfony.comdoccurrentcookbookemailspool.html relnofollowspoola. It says I should use spool with a file, and then send emails with a command. But how should I be running that command If I set a cronjob to execute that command every 1 minute the minimum available in codecroncode, users will have to wait an average of 30 secs for their emails to be sent eg, the registration email.p  pSo I thought of using a queue instead. Im already using a hrefhttpsgithub.comvidelalvaroRabbitMqBundlereadme relnofollowRabbitMQBundlea for image processing eg, thumbnail creation. But I only use this one periodically, so it is consumed from within a cronjob.p  pMaybe I should create a a hrefhttpsgithub.comshaneharterPHPDaemonreadme relnofollowdaemona that is always waiting for new messages to arrive the email queue and deliver them ASAPp

Negative 67719 pGood evening  Im a bit confused by the magic of CakePHP.  Some of it is amazing, but there is a tricky bit confusing me.

How would I tell the UserBasicInfo model what its ID is, if it has a record, when doing inserts It may not always have a record, as I dont force the user to add this info, and I dont like the idea of adding a record full of blank data.

Not a problem, but it really seems like there is a much better way to do this.p

Negative 67719 pIm trying to set up msnodesql formerly nodesqlserver with my azure hosted site and am running into some issues.p  pEssentially Im getting a deployment failed within Azure. I believe it is due to the fact NPM is trying to install msnodesql on the server but will fail because it would need nodegyp, Python and C 2010 installed which is not present on the azure side.  Here is the error message Im seeingp  precodenpm ERR msnodesql0.2.0 install nodegyp rebuild npm ERR cmd c nodegyp rebuild failed with 1 npm ERR  npm ERR Failed at the msnodesql0.2.0 install script. npm ERR This is most likely a problem with the msnodesql package, npm ERR not with npm itself. npm ERR Tell the author that this fails on your system npm ERR     nodegyp rebuild npm ERR You can get their info via npm ERR     npm owner ls msnodesql npm ERR There is likely additional logging output above. codepre  pIve been hacking at this error for a while now and nothing seems to fix it.

I feel like that should fix it but alas it does not.  I also tried compiling it against the local x86 node and also just using a prebuilt x86 one suggested by a hrefhttpgeekswithblogs.netshaunxuarchive20120918node.jsadventurewhennode.jsmeetswindowsazure.aspxhttpgeekswithblogs.netshaunxuarchive20120918node.jsadventurewhennode.jsmeetswindowsazure.aspxa .p  pAny other suggestions would be appreciated here.p  pAlso worth noting is its working in my local environment just fine and can grab data in from the SQL Azure DB I created once ive whitelisted my IP using msnodesql running within webmatrix but hitting Azure SQL DB.p  pI originally had an issue with the DB and the Website in Azure being on different regions, but I corrected that.p

Negative 67719 pI have a projects that Im writing NUnit tests for for example.

However, I dont want to also turn on Package restore either since I believe its a user setting and not a project setting IIRC.p  pWhat is the right way to add .NET project with NuGet dependencies to a git repo  I assume it would be something that would happily grab the Packages but one that requires developer intervention.  Perhaps just expect other developers to know to add those missing packages back into the project  It also seems like wed end up resolving .csproj conflicts all the time too.p

I would like to do this by determining the maximum upper and lower bounds of the cone, and the maximum left and right bounds of the cone. Basically, the location of the highest white pixel, lowest white pixel, left most white pixel and right most white pixel.p  pI know how to draw the lines, but I dont know how to find the bounds of the cone.p  pThe idea is to find a box around the cone so that I can determine the centroid of the cone.p  pAny help is appreciated.p
Negative 67719 pI am porting three.js to java with a few of my own changes and additions.

Negative 67719 pI am a bit new to 80x86 assembly language and we are taught to use TASM since it is the assembler installed on our laboratory PCs. Then, I wanted to practice assembly language programming at home, so I searched and downloaded TASM5 and TASMeditor since theyre the ones available on the internet. However, I found out that it doesnt work on my 64 bit Windows 8 OS. Searching for TASM 64 bit showed how to emulate using DOSBOX, but that is too tedious and may create problems. Searching for terms TASM alternative yielded NASM, and YASM. YASM is a bit complicated to use, so I did not bother with it, and NASM has different syntax with TASM. So, my question is, what can I use as an alternative to TASM With no syntax changes Any other suggestions p  pAdvanced thanksp

Negative 67719 pAsked this on forums.asp.net but got no takers, so I thought Id try here.p  pWeve got an HttpModule that registers for BeginRequest, ReleaseRequestState, and EndRequest.  The main purpose of the module is that when were serving regular html pages, we want a hook to rewrite and encrypt the query strings on hrefs in the generated html.  The filtering is attached in the ReleaseRequestState event handler of our module context.Response.Filter  new MyFilter....p  pBut when were running a page thats going to result in an xml document, the ReleaseRequestState event handler doesnt appear to fire at all  only BeginRequest and EndRequest.p  pAfter a lot of googling, I found posts that say HttpApplication.CompleteRequest will bypass a lot of the event chain and go directly to EndRequest, but nowhere do we call CompleteRequest.  So Im thinking there are other things lower down that call it, or other ways of bypassing ReleaseRequestState.p  pWhen we set up to produce the report xml, we do a Response.Clear and then create an XmlWriter on Response.OutputStream.  Would either of those cause something lower down to bypass the ReleaseRequestState eventp

Negative 67719 pI am designing a website with a header containing two rows of names. When the user hovers over one of the names, a specific div needs to appear below the names. This div will have other images and links contained within it so it is necessary for the user to be able to navigate the mouse from the name down into the div.p  pFor simplicity sake, I will call the top row of names top with the associated div topreveal and the bottom row of names bottom and bottomreveal. See linked jsfiddle.p  pTopreveal and bottomreveal need to appear in the same place and cant overlap the names above.p  pI first tried using straight CSS divfirstchild, but I couldnt control the user intent.p  pI then switched to a jQuery approach with the hoverIntent pluginp  precodevar timeHover  700  [idtop].hoverIntent     over topRevealer,     timeout timeHover,     out topHider  [idbottom].hoverIntent     over bottomRevealer,     timeout timeHover,     out bottomHider   function topRevealer      setTimeoutfunction           bottomreveal.hide, topreveal.fadeIn     , timeHover   function bottomRevealer      setTimeoutfunction           topreveal.hide, bottomreveal.fadeIn     , timeHover   function topHider      topreveal.hide   function bottomHider      bottomreveal.hide  codepre  pI am using a hrefhttpcherne.netbrianresourcesjquery.hoverIntent.html relnofollowhoverIntenta because I couldnt figure out how to do the timeout with .hover. It works, except the reveal div fades out and then back in. I know this is because it is calling TopHider when the mouse moves from Top into TopReveal and then calling TopRevealer once it is into the TopReveal div but I dont want it to pop in and out. I also notice it can create a queue of fading in and out and I dont know how to create an error catcher of sorts.p  pFiddle with where I am at a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netUFZ6U relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netUFZ6Uap  pAs you can see, it is almost there, but I need some guidance for the final push, or even some tips on better JavaScript coding. I have only recently started to work with JavaScript outside of downloading standalone scripts and I have hit my head on the wall too many times now. I am looking for the most straight forward answer, it doesnt have to be jQuery or pure CSS, just a working solution which is lightweight. I am also not married to hoverIntent, but it helped get me this far.p  pI hope this made sense.p  pThank you all potential answerers.p

Negative 67719 pRecently I read the a hrefhttpdocs.python.org2howtodescriptor.html relnofollowofficial HOWTO about Python descriptorsa, which actually derives from a hrefhttpusers.rcn.compythondownloadDescriptor.htm relnofollowan essaya written by Raymond Hettinger long time ago. But after reading it for several times, I am still confused about some parts of it. I will quote some paragraphs, followed by my confusions and questions.p  hr  blockquote   pIf an instances dictionary has an entry with the same name as a data descriptor, the data descriptor takes precedence. If an instances dictionary has an entry with the same name as a nondata descriptor, the dictionary entry takes precedence.p blockquote  ul liIs this the same with class What is the precedence chain of a class if its dictionary has an entry with the same name as a datanondata descriptorli ul  hr  blockquote   pFor objects, the machinery is in codeobject.getattributecode which transforms codeb.xcode into codetypeb.dict[x].getb, typebcode. The implementation works through a precedence chain that gives data descriptors priority over instance variables, instance variables priority over nondata descriptors, and assigns lowest priority to codegetattrcode if provided. p      pFor classes, the machinery is in codetype.getattributecode which transforms codeB.xcode into codeB.dict[x].getNone, Bcode. p blockquote  ul liThe above two paragraphs tell the process of a descriptors being invoked automatically upon attribute access. It lists the difference between attributes being accessed by an instance codeb.xcode and a class codeB.xcode. However, here are my confusions  ul liif the attribute of a class or an instance is not a descriptor, will the transformation i.e., transforms codeb.xcode into codetypeb.dict[x].getb, typebcode and codeB.xcode into codeB.dict[x].getNone, Bcode still proceed Is returning the attribute in this classs or instances strongdictstrong directly simpler li liIf an instances dictionary has an entry with the same name as a nondata descriptor, according to the precedence rule in the first quote, the dictionary entry takes precedence, at this time will the transformation still proceed Or just return the value in its strongdictstrongli ulli ul  hr  blockquote   pNondata descriptors provide a simple mechanism for variations on the usual patterns of binding functions into methods.p blockquote  ul liIs nondata descriptors chosen because functionsmethods can only be stronggottenstrong, but cannot be strongsetstrongli liWhats the underlying mechanism for binding functions into methods Since class dictionaries store methods as functions, if we call the same method using a class and its instance respectively, how can the underlying function tell whether its first argument should be strongselfstrong or notli ul  hr  blockquote   pFunctions have a codegetcode method so that they can be converted to a method when accessed as attributes. The nondata descriptor transforms a codeobj.fargscode call into codefobj, argscode. Calling codeklass.fargscode becomes fargs.p blockquote  ul liHow can a nondata descriptor transform a codeobj.fargscode call into codefobj, argscode li liHow can a nondata descriptor transform a codeklass.fargscode call into codefargscodeli liWhats the underlying mechanism of the above two transformations Why do differences exist between class and instanceli liWhat does the role codegetcode method play under the above circumstance li ul

Negative 67719 pIm developing an application used for analysis of large data set audio files, pattern matching, etc.. The software must run outofthebox as a standalone application, i.e., without any internet connection. It is certainly doable in Java.p  pHowever, a web frontend would make our lives much easier since we have to display lots of structured tables containing graphics. This is very easy to achieve using html. Also, html is a lot more flexible than a JAVA GUIcomponents, i.e., allows for later adaption. Furthermore, for inhouse usage, we could run the software as a normal web application on server hardware  the software is thus more scalable. Hence, I was thinking about writing a web application.p  pNow, I know that certain web frameworks come with standalone webservers integrated. For instance, django has such a webserver integrated for developmenttesting purposes. However, it is not multithreaded.p  pDo you know any standalone webservers running on OSX that fit my use case They should run outofthebox listen on localhost and provide wsgifcgi.p  pHow difficult is it to bundle, e.g., a preconfigured Apache What about maintenance issuesp  pMany thanks in advance for your thoughts on this issue.p

Negative 67719 pOK, I see some similar questions to mine, but their examples all use PHP classes...mine does not. Maybe thats the problem I shouldnt need classes because my site is exceedingly simple at this point in time.p  pAnyway, Im trying to use PDO to connect to a MySQL db. I connect to the db fine in a file called codeconfig.phpcode, and include this file in codeindex.phpcode with coderequireoncecode.p  pI can successfully query the db from another file called codeprocess.phpcode, but the problem is within a function within that file it seems my DBO object is out of scope within that function.p  pHere are the relevant code snippetsp  pstrongindex.phpstrongp  precoderequireonce.libconfig.php codepre  pstrongconfig.phpstrongp  precode tested and connects fine     pdo  new PDOmysqlhost . hostname . dbname . dbname, username, password, array     PDOATTRPERSISTENT gt true  codepre  pstrongprocess.phpstrongp  precodeltphp ...  can call pdo fine in this file outside of functions ...  function authenticateu, p       cant call pdo in here, error says pdo is nonobject     que  pdogtqueryselect userid, userpass from users where username   . u .  limit 1     ...   gt codepre  pBy the way, Im using PDO because I was having similar trouble with codemysqlicode, and am trying to get away from codemysqlcode, which is apparently depreciated and discouraged.p  pEDIT I should have clarified first based on the number of responses I got on this matter I did try to strongpass pdo in as a param to the functionstrong, with no luck or change in the error message.p  pSOLUTION OK, apparently the problem was that I needed to add coderequireonceconfig.phpcode in my strongprocess.phpstrong file as well.

Negative 67719 pOkay so Ive been having a heck of a time getting my IDE environment setup for Ruby and RoR. Every issue so far Ive been able to solve except one so I humbly ask the mighty stackoverflow for guidance. p  pMY RubyMine install is having trouble recognizing some installed gems or more specifically, SQLite3, Mysql, and Mysql2. Using Gem quick install on RubyMine fails on all three, however, installing the gems with the proper config is successful in cmd. While that is successful, RubyMine cannot or will not recognize the installed gems. The require mysql2 with require rubygems placed before it fails right out of the gate with RubyMine stating that it cannot load such a file. When accessing the RoR server on localhost through firefox, I get an error stating that the gem is not loaded and I should add it to my Gemfile  I should state at this point that all the above gems were already in the gemfile and if not I added them and ran bundle install which is confusing. Ive spent days scouring the interwebs and stackoverflow for a solution but nothing seems to work. I even tried going from the 64 version of ruby 2 to the 32 bit version and some previous versions.p  pon a side note, would it be easier to code ruby in a linux distro like Ubuntup  pCurrently I am using RubyMine 5.4 IDE on Windows 8x64 within a custom rig. I have three Ruby SDKs to use 2.0x64PO, 2.0PO, and 1.9.3 and have the most current version of Rails installed.

Negative 67719 pUsing RIA Services and EF5 EF model generated from Database.p  pI have a Parent object lets call it Class A. Class A has a collection of ClassBs.

However, they wish to be able to select which ones they will actually create.p  pSo I create a wrapper holding the new ClassB item with a delegate to the actual action that will add the ClassB to Class As collection.p  pSo if the default is for Class A to have 2ClassBs but I deselect the first one and then action the required actions and save my changes I notice that my Class As collection of ClassBs correctly contains only the one ClassB, but when I call SaveChanges on the context both diary items get saved.p  pWhat Ive realised is that when  I add the ClassC to the ClassB, the ClassB is automatoically added to the Class Cs collection of ClassBs.p  pSo when I call savechanges on the context, although Ive only added the one ClassB to ClassA, both get saved because they have been added to ClassCp  pAs ClassC only maps to what is essentially a lookup table we have no need to ever edit this or save changes, and we havent implemented any CRUD functionality for it.p  pAnd while we have metadata classes for classA with includes for ClassB, and metadata for ClassB to include ClassC, there is no metadata class for Class C.p  pAny ideas how I can get around this issuep

Basically, if I can get access to javascript variables which may be a text, js or json file in my jade template, so I can use the data in my template and generate static html files. What is the best way to do thisp  hr  h2Edith2  pTo clarify further, I may have data like say in a json filep  precodeuser1  link , lbl User, txt .... lot 0f text .... user2  link , lbl User, txt .... lot 0f text .... codepre  pin my mixin, somehow I need to access user1, user2 etc in my jade templatep  precode.content         columuser1          columuser2   mixin columd     .span4         h4              d.lbl         p              d.txt codepre  pThanks a ton.p
Negative 67719 pI am new to iOS programming and this is the first app Ive ever made. Basically I did not know about core data when making this app so I made the classes normally. My app is basically a todo list app with Tasks as objects that enter the taskArray array that acts as data source to TableViewController. The tasks are entered to the taskArray by users. I just have one question when migrating from objects that are erased when the app closes to core data Should I delete my Task class and remake it as an entity in Core Data If so, would it be possible to add the objects I make with Core Data to the taskArray or would I have to completely remodel my whole app and cellForRowAtIndexPathp  pHere is some of my codep  pTasks.hp  precodeinterface Tasks

Negative 67719 pI want to use the depth buffer in a slightly unorthodox way and I got heavily confused by all the normalization, scaling and what ever is going on there.p  pMy plan is to implement a spatial hashing algorithm by some guys from AMD a hrefhttpwww.chrisoat.compapersEfficientSpatialBinning.pdf relnofollowlink to pdfa. p  ptldrversion Speed up nearestneighborsearch by discretizing 3Dvertices into an array of flat 2D depth textures, setting the depth to the VertexID. The reason for using depth textures is that there is some smart depth testing going on to even get the results in a sorted order, but thats less important here.p  pMy problem is that the VertexID is obviously an integer, ranging from code0code to the total amount of vertices codeParticleCountcode, but that cant be directly used, as the output of the vertex shader has to be normalized to code[1..1code in OpenGL or code[0..1code in DirectX.p  pMy vertex shader therefore does something like thatp  precodefloat depth  2.0  glVertexID  ParticleCount  1.0 glPosition  vec4flatCoords, depth, 1.0 codepre  pThat is kind of working, but what values are actually stored to the depth texture bound to the current framebuffer confuses me. I dont quite get the difference between the floatingpoint depth buffer and the integer version, if I cant even output real integers and when reading from the depth texture later everything seems to be normalized to code[0..1]code no matter what internal format I set DepthComponent24, 32, 32f.p  pCan someone give me some advice how to get the VertexIDs out of these depth texturesp  pThanksp

Negative 67719 pI am programming a robot with C  and using a digitial compass for direction.  Problem I am having is when it goes into its turn loop, it doesnt come back out of it.  The DragonBoard is my controller I am talking too.  How this is supposed to work is given set heading and time, it turns left or right till heading is matched then drives forward for a set amount of time.  Problem I am having is it will go forward but when it goes into the turn loop, it stays there, and doesnt return to for loop.  Any help would be appreciated.p  precodeprivate void driveint heading, int timegoing to start from kit      int i      for i  0 i lt timei               DragonBoard.Writewgo forward          while int.ParsebearingTxt.Text  1 gt heading                      DragonBoard.Writeaturn left             break                   while int.ParsebearingTxt.Text 1 lt heading                      DragonBoard.Writedturn right             break                    DragonBoard.Write       if listBox1.SelectedIndex lt listBox1.Items.Count  1              listBox1.SelectedIndex  listBox1.SelectedIndex  1         decision      codepre
Negative 67719 pI have a SpringMVC web application that needs to authenticate to a RESTful web service using Spring Security by sending the username and password. When an user is logged, a cookie needs to be set to the users browser and in the subsequent calls the user session is validated with another RESTful web service by using the cookie.p  pIve been looking everywhere, but I have not been able to find a good example on how to accomplish this, and all my attempts have been in vain.p  pHere is what I have in mindp  pI can have two authenticationproviders declared, the first checks the cookie, and if it fails for any reason it goes to the second one which checks with the username and password will fail too if there is no username and password in that request.p  pBoth services return the authorities of the user each time, and spring security is stateless.p  pOn the other hand, I have questioned myself if this approach is correct, since its been so difficult to find an example or somebody else with the same problem. Is this approach wrongp  pThe reason why I want to do this instead of just JDBC authentication is because my whole web application is stateless and the database is always accessed through RESTful web services that wrap a petitions queue, Id like to respect this for user authentication and validation too.p  pWhat have I tried so far I could paste the long long springSecuritycontext.xml, but Ill just list them instead for nowp  ol liUse a custom authenticationFilter with a authenticationSuccessHandler. Obviously doesnt work because the user is already logged in this point.li liMake an implementation of entrypointref filter.li liDo a customfilter in the position BASICAUTHFILTERli liMake a custom Authentication Provider Struggled a lot with no luck.

Negative 67719 pI have just installed Pydev on my existing copy of Eclipse for Java, running on OSX 10.7.  When I make a new pydev package, I click away from the default directory for my java files and into one for python files.  Once it is created, the project shows in the pydev package explorer window.  However, once I close the package, it disappears from the pydev explorer window, but shows in the java explorer window under java perspective.  I can run the python project from the java perspective, but I want to try and keep my projects separated infuriating. p  pAlso, if I want to create a new pydev package, I have to first delete a .project file from the python project directory before I can create a new package.p  pIve been looking around for an answer to this problem for a while, and most talk about changing different filter settings in the explorers, but the filter settings for both pydev and java seems to indicate what I want it to do key word seems.  p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.  Ive wasted too much time on this triviality.  Thanks.p

Negative 67719 pI am new to Java and have just came across a tutorial which uses theThrows keyword in a method. I have done a little research into this but still do not really understand it.p  pFrom what I have seen so far, it is telling the compiler that a certain exception may be thrown in that particular method. Why do we need to tell the compiler this I have made many programs using merely a trycatch statement in my methods and it has worked just fine  surely it is these trycatch statements which manage exceptions, rightp
Negative 67719 pIm using Django 1.4.3 with Python 2.7, Celery 3.0.1 and djangocelery 3.0.17 on Ubuntu 13.04.p  pI have some tasks setup to run time consuming processes.

Negative 67719 pstrongEditstrong It has been quite rightly pointed out to me that my original approach to this question was focusing on the wrong problem. I have now restructured it to focus on the root cause rather than my specific goals. I will continue to keep the question updated with what I try.p  pI am building an application in Laravel 4 that is due to be deployed on a production server that is currently adding escape slashes to any string added to the database. this isnt happening on my local development environment. I have tried investigating whether it would be possible to prevent this from happening by disabling codemagicquotesgpccode in the PHP configuration but it was already disabled.p  pIt would be preferable to be able to resolve the root cause of this problem. To that end any pointers as to what other configuration options could be the cause of the problem would be gratefully received. I will continue to look into this myself and keep the question up to date with what I have tried.p  pMy original question was how I could find a way to apply codestripslashescode at a model level so that the escape characters are at least appearing in my views. Ideally I would like this not to be necessary however I cannot rule out pursuing this as a short term remedy if it were achievable.p

Negative 67719 pThis could be a very trivial question to many, but I havent got a solution as to how I can make my WCF service run on a static port on Visual Studio development server so that my client can directly add the service reference and consume it.  Im using .net 4.5, Visual Studio 2013 professional edition where the Project properties window does not have the option to disable dynamic port usage. Any ideas as to how I can make it happen will be much appreciated.p  pThank you.p
Negative 67719 pIm trying to do an application that, on the first activity, user can mark several checkbox, from 1 to seven or eight it depends on final version. When user have marked his options and he click on a search button, I want to show a list showing diferent objects depending on the marked items.p  pMy objects are custom objects ground,it have many characteristics, like strings or intboolean 1 or 0, stored in a database sqlite. In my main activity, I use a lot of if else to know how many of checkbox are checked, I put this information into intent via extras, and in my second activity list I retrieve this extras and I do another if else to know what list the app must show.  I think this method is such rudimentary because i have to do a lot of if else on both activities. I have tried to make in the first activity a dbquery returning a list, and send this list via intent, but I have followed a lot of tutorials and always I have a list of correct number of objects but always the same overwrited objectp  pAny ideas of what to dop  pThank you in advancep  pFIRST ACTIVITYp  precodepublic class MainActivity extends Activity       Button bafegeix, bcerca, bneteja

I installed new font that should fix this YGPNT but I am having the same problem yes, I changed it from the cmd Properties, edited the TrueTypeFont with regedit and restarted the PC. I can write in cyrillic in the cmd if that can help.p

Negative 67719 pI found the below code which I have modified slightly for my needs.  The issue Im having is it doesnt do exactly what Id like.  Specifically, I have a drop down menu in A1 of each sheet with the names of the three sheets, Shipping, Orders, and Inventory in my workbook.  What Im trying to accomplish is whenever a user selects a drop down menu item regardless of the sheet they are working in, the relevant sheet is shown and the other two are hidden.p  pThe below code works, but only if all three sheets have the same sheet name in the drop down selected, which becomes untenable when two sheets get hidden.  Im not exactly sure how to overcome this, but hopefully someone here who is much better at this than I am will have some advice.p  pCurrent VB Codep  precodePrivate Sub WorksheetChangeByVal Target As Range      If Target.Value  Shipping Then         SheetsShipping.Visible  True         SheetsOrders.Visible  False         SheetsInventory.Visible  False      ElseIf Target.Value  Orders Then         SheetsOrders.Visible  True         SheetsShipping.Visible  False         SheetsInventory.Visible  False      ElseIf Target.Value  Inventory Then         SheetsInventory.Visible  True         SheetsShipping.Visible  False         SheetsOrders.Visible  False      End If End Sub codepre

But AJAX cant see it, the error strings I have in the AJAX code are not displayed, the only one that displays is Some error occured  I even changed it for  successfully updated at some stage cause the database is updatedp  pAny help would be very much appreciatedp  pPage called    myaccount.phpp  precode    ltphp  AJAX CALLS THIS CODE TO EXECUTE  ifissetPOST[p]issetPOST[a1]issetPOST[a2]issetPOST[c]issetPOST[co]issetPOST[con]issetPOST[da1]issetPOST[da2]issetPOST[dc]issetPOST[dco]issetPOST[addcheckbox]     requireonce.includesmysqlconnect.php  p  mysqlrealescapestringtrimPOST[p] a1  mysqlrealescapestringtrimPOST[a1] a2  mysqlrealescapestringtrimPOST[a2] c  mysqlrealescapestringtrimPOST[c] co  mysqlrealescapestringtrimPOST[co]   da1  mysqlrealescapestringtrimPOST[da1] da2  mysqlrealescapestringtrimPOST[da2] dc  mysqlrealescapestringtrimPOST[dc] dco  mysqlrealescapestringtrimPOST[dco]  ifissetPOST[addcheckbox]ticked     da1  mysqlrealescapestringtrimPOST[a1] da2  mysqlrealescapestringtrimPOST[a2] dc  mysqlrealescapestringtrimPOST[c] dco  mysqlrealescapestringtrimPOST[co]        sql  UPDATE customers SET address1a1, address2a2, phonep, cityc, countyco, countrycon, delad1da1, delad2da2, delcitydc, delcountydco WHERE idcustid query  mysqlquerysql  ifquery      echo success     exit else      echo notupdated     exit            gt codepre  pthis is the javascriptp  precode    ltscript typetextjavascript languagejavascriptgt       function changeaddress       var p  phone.value     var a1  address1.value     var a2  address2.value     var c  city.value     var co  county.value     var con  country.value      var da1  deladdress1.value     var da2  deladdress2.value     var dc  delcity.value     var dco  delcounty.value  checkbox      ifdocument.getElementsByIdaddcheckbox.checked         var da1  a1            var da2  a2         var dc  c         var dco  co          else         var da1  deladdress1.value         var da2  deladdress2.value         var dc  delcity.value         var dco  delcounty.value   ajax call      ifpp ampamp a1 ampamp a2a2 ampamp c ampamp co         changeaddbtn.style.display  none         status.innerHTML  updating your details ...          var ajax  ajaxObjPOST, myaccount.php          ajax.onreadystatechange  function              ifajaxReturnajax  true                  var response  ajax.responseText                 ifresponse  success                     changeaddressform.innerHTML  lth3gtAddress is updated, check the first tabltpgt                  else if response  notupdated                     status.innerHTML  An error occured , the details were not updated                  else                      status.innerHTML  Some error occured                               else                 status.innerHTML  loading...                  ajax.sendppampa1a1ampa2a2ampccampcocoampda1da1ampda2da2ampdcdcampdcodco                              ltscriptgt codepre  pthis is the Billingpartp  precode                        Address                                            ltinput classinputfield typetext size40 idaddress1 nameaddress1 valueltphp echo .getrow[address1]. gtgt                           Address                                              ltinput classinputfield typetext size40 idaddress2 nameaddress2 valueltphp echo .getrow[address2].  gtgt                          CityTown                          ltinput classinputfield typetext size40 idcity namecity valueltphp  echo .getrow[city].  gtgt                          County                                             ltinput classinputfield  typetext size40 idcounty namecounty valueltphp  echo .getrow[county].  gtgt                   ltpgtltbutton idchangeaddbtn classsubmitbtn onclickchangeaddress gtSubmit Changesltbuttongt codepre  pDeliveryp  precodeltinput typecheckbox nameaddcheckbox idaddcheckbox valueticked  gt Same as billing ltpgt codepre  pp  precode                        Address                                              ltinput classinputfield typetext size40 iddeladdress2 valueltphp echo .getrow[delad2].  gtgt                          CityTown                                            ltinput classinputfield typetext size40 iddelcity valueltphp  echo .getrow[delcity].  gtgt                          County                                            ltinput classinputfield  typetext size40 iddelcounty valueltphp  echo .getrow[delcounty].  gtgt             ltpgtltbutton idchangeaddbtn classsubmitbtn onclickchangeaddress gtSubmit Changesltbuttongtltpgt                     ltp idstatusgtltpgt                     ltp idstatus1gtltpgt                     ltp idstatus2gtltpgt                     ltp idstatus3gtltpgt codepre

Negative 67719 pI have been working on a group of installers over a few years and am starting to run into problems with the amount of disk space that is used when the package is installed. The installer works great but installscopies a few redundant sets of files in the process. I do admit that that some of my assumptions may not be correct, but this is based on my best understanding of the MSI processes. Let me explain ...p  p1. strongSelfextractor filestrong  The compressed MSI, associated bootstrapper packages and setup.exe file is downloaded by the user creating the 1st set of redundant files. Not a big deal, because this can easily be deleted after install.p  p2. strongExtracted Files folderstrong  After running the EXE the files are extracted to a static location from which the bootstrapper is launched. This now has created the 2nd set of uncompressed redundant files on the hard drive. These files are useful to be able to reinstall of debug installs as needed, but may not be needed after install is completed. It has never been clear to me whether patched installs depend on these files or only the files stored in CWindowsInstaller. Assuming the latter.p  p3. strongTEMP folderstrong  As the installer runs from the extracted location it copies files to the TEMP folder and runs the files from that location. This creates the 3rd set of redundant files. Again it is not really clear whether these files can be removed after install or if there is an automated process that MSI does to make this happen.p  p4. strongWindowsInstaller folderstrong  If I understand correctly this is where some sort of stripped out file set is stored that manages the ability to patch. So this is the 4th set of files that may or may not be smaller than the some of the extracted sets of files. This one needs to not be deleted so patching will work.p  p5. strongInstall foldersstrong  Final install location for the software. This is now the 5th set of files that are installed to my computer and of course is the desired set of files.p  pI would like to better understand the process so I can improve the way that I distribute our software so that I can avoid or resolve some of the issues I am seeing with needing many different sets of files. I am very open to any best practice that might be out there that I have not observed. Thanks for your help.p

Negative 67719 pIm currently in the process of converting one of my projects over to strongSpriteKitstrong, and Im having some trouble with my conversions of codeanimateWithDurationcode to codeSKAction MoveByY durationcode  First is the fact that codeanimateWithDurationcode gives you a nice aesthetic speeding up and slowing down which is lost in codeSKActioncode. Annoying, but not game breaking. Second is the fact that codeanimateWithDurationcode will calculate its end position immediately, whereas codeSKActioncode calculates its position constantly. This is a problem for me because I have a gameboard where a row of codespriteNodescode are moving down the screen. If a node in the middle of this row is deleted, I need the nodes below that node to move up to the now vacant positions. This means that they are going to a moving target, and using codeSKActioncode they overshoot the position. I could solve this buy adding another codeSKActioncode, but then I have to account for the pieces falling at different speeds and it starts to get messy fast. I was wondering if anyone had a nice clean solution that didnt involve guesswork Ideally I would just run the codeanimateWithDurationcode on the codespriteNodecode, but unfortunately that doesnt work. p  pThis was my initial animation codep  precode[UIView animateWithDurationcollapseSpeed animations[[[activePiecesVerticalOne objectAtIndexpiecesInArrayOne  1] imageView] setCenterCGPointMake 30, positionOfLastObjectArrayOne ] ] codepre  pand this is my new codep  precodeSKAction collapseUp  [SKAction moveToYpositionOfLastObjectArrayOne durationcollapseSpeed] collapseUp.timingMode  SKActionTimingEaseInEaseOut  thanks Can SKAction correctPosition  [SKAction moveByX0 ycorrectionVariable duration.1] SKAction theAnimation  [SKAction group[collapseUp, correctPosition]]  [[fallingPiecesRowOne objectAtIndexpiecesInArrayOne  1] runActiontheAnimation] codepre  pApologies to Can, as I was actually already using moveTo and not moveBy. The variable correctPosition  fallingPiecesSpeed  25. fallingPieceSpeed is .1, which is how far every falling piece is moved every .01 seconds via the update method. I rationalized that during the .25 seconds it takes to animate the piece up, it was missing 25 of these .1 movement increments and thus implemented this to try and fix my issue. I believe that using the animateWithDuration, these movement increments would be stored and applied to the piece as it falls, which is what Im missing with SKAction. This solution seems to work ok as long as I keep fallingPieceSpeed at .1, but cranking it up to .3 gives me major inconsistencies on where the pieces end up. p  pHopefully this makes sense. As I mentioned, I was hoping to bypass all of this with a cleaner approach, but I may have to just keep tinkering with this to find my solution Sp

Negative 67719 pAs the title suggests. I would like to give users the option to download invoices for purchases that have been made in the past. I would not like to store these files so that they are easily accessible via http, e.g. codehttpwww.site.cominv567.pdfcode.p  pI have thought of one way of doing this however i do not think that it is the best solution for this.p  pSo in essence, I would have a folder on my server out of the public root and within this folder would be folders each with say a unique ID that relates to the customers account ID MySQL row ID. Within each of these folders I could store the invoices or .pdf files relating to each customer.p  pI could build into the CMS for the admin a section that would deal with uploading these files to the various user accounts.p  pFor the customer, when they click on the download button for any specific invoice, the server will copy the invoice to a temp directory in the public root but renaming it in the process to some obscure hash. The header is then directed to this location.p  pI could then run a cron job to clear this temp folder every x amount of time.p  pGiven that I have never really attempted to accomplish this task before, I have thought it best to ask for any suggestions  feedback  advice or comments in relation to this as I am sure that you guys will have some good ideas on how to do this too. Thank you in advance for any assistance providedp

Negative 67719 pIm trying to get some data to be sent correctly to a external program.

However, as this data can grow to be quite large, Im attempting to break up the data to send in chunks.p  precodechar encodedBMPData  EncodeImagehBitmap, info, mcurrentImageLength  int numOfChunks  mcurrentImageLength  fiveMBByteSize long trailingLength  mcurrentImageLength  numOfChunks  fiveMBByteSize iftrailingLength gt 0     numOfChunks One more chunk for trailing length  char segmentedImageData  charmallocnumOfChunkssizeofchar  forint i  0 i lt numOfChunks i      ifi1  numOfChunks              segmentedImageData[i]  charmallocfiveMBByteSize  sizeofchar         long memorySpace  ifiveMBByteSize         memcpysegmentedImageData[i], encodedBMPData  memorySpace, fiveMBByteSize          else              segmentedImageData[i]  charmalloctrailingLength  sizeofchar         long memorySpace  ifiveMBByteSize         memcpysegmentedImageData[i], encodedBMPData  memorySpace, trailingLength        status  PostMessagethisgtmhMasterMessageWnd, WMIMAGESEGMENTEDREADY, WPARAMampnumOfChunks, LPARAMsegmentedImageData freeencodedBMPData codepre  pAs far as why Im using a string, for those of you curious, is that this is in a ActiveX control and passes data to Javascript. I have tested this for small image sizes to transmit everything in one go so Id pass just the encodedBMPData away and the javascript it gets handed off to, it works correctly. If I have a small image hit this specific code and get transmitted in one chunk, it still breaks on server side when it attempts to decode it.p  pAppreciate any help yall can give.p  pstrongEditstrong Oh and since I named it horribly, Ill say here that mcurrentImageLength is actually the length of the encoded data, not the raw image byte length by the time it reaches this function.p

Negative 67719 pI am developing an android application in which I want to integrate datahome timeline from multiple social medias. Making API calls and getting response from each of them is bit time consuming if done in a serial fashion. So i want a parallel environment to make API calls to facebook twitter Instagram etc. and fetch the data in minimum time.p  pI have used Async tasks at present for fetching data from each social media..i.e one async task will call the api of facebook for fetching data, second will call the api of twitter and so on. I call all the async tasks from UI thread. I thought that all async tasks will work simultaneously in a parallel environment.. But after running the code it seems that one async task blocks the work of others and they get called only in a serial fashion. First async task called completes the work first and the last asynctask called completes the work at last. Android version I am using for development is 4.3. I have searched about THREAD POOL EXECUTOR in android for parallel processing but i am not getting a clear idea. It would be great if anyone can help me out. Thanks in advance. p

Negative 67719 pIn briefp  pI am writing selenium tests in JAVA for a web application that does not have nice ids i.e. they are dynamically generated.p  pMy situation involves two comboboxes, or picklists if you prefer, with ids that look something like this Note In reality I may have hundreds of these on a page not just two.  Two is to keep it simple   p  precodeelementOne id  12345WORKRECORD678  elementTwo id  9876WORKRECORD5432. codepre  pUsing CSSSelectors I am able to get these elements in a List using this   p  precode...findElementsBy.cssSelectorselect[idWORKRECORD] codepre  pWhere  works similar to a CONTAINS statement.p  pThe problem is that I dont know which element is which because I cant utilize the whole id.  All i know is that I have a List of picklists, but I cant easily choose the ONE that I want or need.  This is because the only consistent part of the id is WORKRECORD, everything else is dynamic. p  pIn order to know which element to utilized for my test Im having to iterate through each item option in the picklist and make a decision based on what is there.  So something like thisp  precode    Get all picklists that contain string WORKRECORD in their id.      ListltWebElementgt picklists           driver.findElementsBy.cssSelectorselect[idWORKRECORD]          iterate through these picklists and get lists of options     forWebElement picklist  picklists              get all itemsoptions in the picklist         ListltWebElementgt options  picklist.findElementsBy.tagNameoption          Next go through each value and see if it is the one I want.           If so, then I found my web element         forWebElement option  options                      ifoption.equalsmyValue                              myWantedWebElement  picklist                 return myWantedWebElement                            codepre  pSo my question is thisp  pstrongCan I use CSS to locate a webElement based on a value that is found in the options  For example, the psuedocode would be like thisstrongp  precodeListltWebElementgt picklists       driver.findElementsBy.cssSelectorselect[idWORKRECORD]option[value contains myValues] codepre  pOr will I just have to go with what I am doing  Or is there something so much better that it will blow my mind, etc...p  pThanks all and Cheersp

Negative 67719 pI am reading the lt a hrefhttpnlp.stanford.edufsnlp relnofollowFoundations of Statistical Natural Language Processinga . It has the following statement about the relationship between information entropy and language modelp  blockquote   p...The essential point here is that if a model captures more of the   structure of a language, then the entropy of the model should be   lower. In other words, we can sue entropy as a measure of the quality   of our models...p blockquote  pBut how about this examplep  pSuppose we have a machine that spit 2 characters, A and B, one by one. And the designer of the machine makes A and B has the equal probability.p  pI am not the designer. And I try to model it through experiment.p  pDuring a initial experiment, I see the machine split the following character sequencep  blockquote   pA, B, Ap blockquote  pSo I model the machine as PA23 and PB13. And we can calculate entropy of this model as p  precode23Log2313Log13 0.918 bit  the base is 2 codepre  pBut then, the designer tell me about his design, so I refined my model with this more information. The new model looks like thisp  pPA12 PB12p  pAnd the entropy of this new model isp  precode12Log1212Log12  1 bit codepre  pThe second model is obviously better than the first one. But the entropy increased.p  pMy point is, due to the arbitrariness of the model being tried, we cannot blindly say a smaller entropy indicates a better model.p  pCould anyone shed some light on thisp  h2ADD 1h2  pMuch thanks to Rob Neuhausp  pYes, after I redigested the mentioned NLP book. I think I can explain it now.p  pWhat I calculated is actually the entropy of the language model distribution. It cannot be used to evaluate the effectiveness of a language model.p  pTo evaluate a language model, we should measure how much strongemsurpriseemstrong it gives us for real sequences in that language. For each real word encountered, the language model will give a probability strongpstrong. And we use stronglogpstrong to quantify the surprise. And we average the total surprise over a long enough sequence. So, in case of a 1000letter sequence with 500 A and 500 B, the surprise given by the 1323 model will bep  p[500log13  500log23]1000  12  Log92p  pWhile the correct 1212 model will givep  p[500log12  500log12]1000  12  Log82p  pstrongSo, we can see, the 13, 23 model gives more surprise, which indicates it is worse than the correct model.strongp  pOnly when the sequence is long enough, the average effect will mimic the expectation over the 1212 distribution. If the sequence is short, it wont give a convincing result.p  pI didnt mention the strongcrossentropystrong here since I think this jargon is too intimidating and not much helpful to reveal the root cause.p

Negative 67719 pOk, Im at a loss.  I have a tableview that works fine in iPhone 55S, but can only manage 4 fps on an iPhone 4.  Ive tried every trick in the book to optimize the cells opaque, misaligned frames, no blending, render uilabels into images, static cell heights, etc, but it didnt even move the needle.  Thinking that the root cause could be somewhere else, I decided to strip out all my custom cell code so that codecellForRowAtIndexPathcode returns an empty but reused UITableViewCell, and even that runs slow...  Ive tried profiling the app while scrolling the tableview, but nothing stands out at all.  The only thing that seems suspicious is that if turn on CoreAnimations codeColor Hits Green and Misses Redcode, the status bar will constantly flash between green and red as I scroll the tableview.  This leads me to believe that the status bar is being redrawn every frame or every couple of frames, but even hiding the status bar didnt improve the fps by much maybe 4  7.  p  pSo.... Im at a loss.

Negative 67719 pEDIT Heres the complete code. modified the code to work with a router but the use case is same. Once i issue the password using libssh2channelwrite subsequent libssh2channelread fails with LIBSSH2ERRORSOCKETRECV. Not sure why. I am unable to send subsequent commands to the remote device and get their output.p  pLogic was to execute a command on the remote device  libssh2channelexec . This command execution would throw a password to be entered by the client.

Negative 67719 pWe have a WPF application that allows users to enter and style text as they wish. Their text is then transformed to XPS to be inserted in a PDF using ABCPdf.p  pWe have recently switched to .Net 4, and now the XPS generation sometimes generates badlyformed XPS.p  pThe only time when a badlyformed XPS is generated is when the user uses a font that overlaps two characters such as Sevillana, a hrefhttpswww.google.comfonts relnofollowavailable on Google Fontsa. In .Net 4, the characters overlap, whereas in .Net 3.5, they do not.

Negative 67719 pGood night,p  pI have a SVG with a path in. This SVG has a viewBox to mantein the aspect ratio but the problem is that this figure path when it is going to be rotated the transformorigin the point of rotation is set to 0 point of the viewBox and not of the SVG. I want to rotate it with the point of rotation beeing the right corner or the left corner of the browser display the the corner of thee SVG in my case, not the viewbox which is limitated when the dimensions changes. I try to do using groups and using all avaible units, cm,mm,pt,em,ex,px,... But all of then work in viewBox, and I dont see the difference between the relative and absolute units. I tryed the proportions  but not seems to work at least in firefox. And the same  with  center, right, left...p  pAnyway I dont think that units would fix the issue. There is something Im not seeing.p  pPd It can be helped by JS or other scripting language.p  pThanks you very much,p

I have a static library which has been linked by two shared libraries, and there is a global object in the static library.p  pBy my understanding, the global object will be exist in both code.socode, and will cause issues because the function symbols in each shared library access different global variables.p  pI referred the static library in the command line when building both shared libraries. I have been using codeWl,wholearchivecode and codeWl,z,defscode switches. So the shared library contains the symbols of the static library.p  pSo the question isp  ol liWhen linking the executable, why doesnt the GCCLD report duplicate symbols error for this caseli liDoes that means we never link to the same static library in an applications shared library and the executable itselfli ol  pEdit 1p  pAs strongR Sohastrong said we shouldnt have status in static library, or should provide an shared library.p  pAnd I think it is bad and sad to have this limitation Static library should not have status or should be provide as an shared libraries. p  pThe reason is  1. The global variable is common used, for example in my case, it is an singleton object.   2. The static library may be provided by an third party. And maybe the user also using an shared library provide by another third party, which has already linked the static library, for example boost.p

Negative 67719 pDear fellow JS developers p  pIm trying to make a batch of serverside http requests within a Meteor app on a timed interval and make updates to the MongoDB database based on the responses received. Every 15 seconds, the batch of requests should begin and the set of requests should be spread evenly across the 15 seconds rather than flooding the API server all at once. To spread the requests evenly, I am attempting to use the setTimeout method.p  pThere are two parameters that change between each http request, and these varying values are stored in two separate arrays. Rather than spelling out each and every http request if you count all the combinations between the two arrays, 20480, Ive written a for loop within a for loop to greatly consolidate the code. For each response, if it comes back OK, two switch statements handle how the response should be treated by evaluating its codeicode and codeycode values.p  pThe problem I seem to be in callback hell. When the responses arrive from the server, the values of codeicode andor codeycode sometimes have already been incremented by the loop system, so I cannot with 100 certainty handle the responses with the switch statements. The codeupdatedbcode function ends up performing certain calculations on the wrong responses storing them in the wrong places in the database.p  pHoping someone can provide some guidance on what I can do differently to fix this as Im at my wits end.p  pP.S.

Negative 67719 pI have a question regarding a good way to optimize the transfer of anywhere from 1 billion to 1.3 billion records with capacity up to 2 billion or more records in the future between Oracle and SQL Server.p  pEDITI forgot to mention  this process needs to be run weekly, within the time frame of of 1 weekend.p  pCurrently I plan on using an ETL package.  Im looking at Talend or SSIS for right now.  p  pHere is the data setup.  The data resides on Oracle, and needs to be gathered first and repackaged before transmission.p  pCurrently my process is this 1.  A stored proc Extracts all the data and repackages it into an oracle table. 2.  An ETL will scan this table and move it to SQL Server DB. 3.  The table on Oracle and SQL Server are identical.p  pI was looking for some thoughts on optimization of the process.  How would be good ways to optimize the inserts into SQLserverp  p1.  I was thinking to just simply drop the table on SQL Server and then do create table as select  from oracletablep  p2.  A redesign of the stored proc such that it runs in the ETL saves me from having to insert into the oracle and then directly insert into SQL Server  On low volume tests with Talend I cant speak for SSIS I got some performance issues  the restructured procedure took longer to extract the data then calling it directly on Oracle.  Is this normal, or maybe I messed up the optimizationp  p3.  Is there a better way to do massive data transmission that I am not aware ofp  pAny advice would be great.  I think linked servers are an option here, but one is not setup, and Ive never set one up before. p  pAny pointstips would be great, as Im pretty new to this whole thing.p

Negative 67719 pSo Im trying to create a 3D web product designer similar top  pZazzles Custom iPhone Builder  a hrefhttpwww.zazzle.comcasemateiphone55svibecaseiphone55scase179139058105217167 relnofollowhttpwww.zazzle.comcasemateiphone55svibecaseiphone55scase179139058105217167ap  pShoesOfPrey a hrefhttpswww.shoesofprey.com3ddesignerp20600P4 relnofollowhttpswww.shoesofprey.com3ddesignerp20600P4ap  pIt seems that the 3D modeling skinning, colors, etc is done server side, with jpeg snapshots taken at a few angles and passed to the client. I have a blender script that does this on my computer, but Im not sure what rendering engine they are running or how they are hosting it. p  pI would like to recreate this functionality exactly with other custom products mugs, clothing, etc. Im not worried about the front end design tools nor editing the 3D model with user inputs. I plan on using Django and Blender  python scripts to spit out images. p  pI want to know how to properly architect this app to get a working Version 1 prototype. Im familiar with Django and frontend design tools, but have little to no experience with networking, hosting, scaling, setting up workers, load balancing, task queuing, passing data from render farm to django, etc. p  pThat might be a bit too open ended, so Ill try to be more specific. Apologies for the noobnessp  pstrongQuestion 1strong Whats a good hosting service for blender that lets me run the python scriptsp  pstrongQuestion 2strong Would Celery come in handy anywhere here Not too sure about what it does or why its important.p  pstrongQuestion 3strong Ideally, Id like users to see a resulting image in lt1 second doesnt have to be as fast as the examples. The app would need to handle maybe 100 simultaneous users at a time. Would I need a render farm, or can any server running python handle this loadp  pIf theres anything Im overlooking, please let me know This is also my first stackoverflow post, and Im a little disappointed in myself that it is a vague question without any code . p  pstrongEDIT Question 4strong A possible tech stack suggestion Django  Blender   that could be used to make a project like this would be helpful in getting me off the ground and looking into the right places for answers.p

Negative 67719 pMy point of origin 0,0 on my GUI is moved up by about 2526 pixels. So the very topleft corner of my GUI seems to represent 0,25 or 0,26. I am using a double buffer to draw in things. Basically, whenever I try to draw something in my buffer at 0,0, it appears offscreen.  p  pFor example, below is a screenshot of a checkerboard pattern I attempted to generate, starting from 0,0. Although it seems fine horizontally, notice the chopped checkerboard at the top. The height is 480, which is divisible by 32 keep in mind, so the checkerboard pattern should fill in perfectly.  p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com3zNdO.png altimage  p  pAnd here is my code Snipped in irrelevant partsp  precodepublic class DekarigameGUI extends JFrame implements KeyListener   Resources private final String imagePath  ResourcesImages private final String spriteSheetPath  imagePath  Sprite Sheets private final String soundPath  ResourcesSounds private final String dataPath  ResourcesData private BufferedImage[][] sprites private Timer playerMovementTimer  new Timer Game variables private int pX  0, pY  0 private short pDir  1, pLastDir  0, pAniStage  0, counter  0 Graphics and paint variables private Graphics buffer private Image offscreen private Dimension dim Internal variables, used for loops and placeholders private int a, b, c, d                                                                                                                            ,      public DekarigameGUI       Declaring GUI setup     setResizablefalse     setTitleDekari RPG Indev v1.0     setDefaultCloseOperationEXITONCLOSE     pack     setSize640, 480     setBackgroundColor.GREEN     setLocationRelativeTonull Centers the window      splitSpriteSheets Sets up resources      dim  getSize     offscreen  createImagedim.width, dim.height     buffer  offscreen.getGraphics      snip      setVisibletrue   snip                                                       ,    public void paintGraphics g      Clears the buffer     buffer.clearRect0, 0, dim.width, dim.width     Drawing images to the buffer     buffer.setColorColor.BLACK     boolean paint  true     This is my checkerboard drawing function     for a  0 a lt getWidth  32 a          for b  0 b lt getHeight  32 b              if paint                  paint  false                 buffer.fillRecta  32, b  32, 32, 32              else                  paint  true                                if pDir  1 If the player is not moving         Draws player in an idle stance facing last moved direction         buffer.drawImagesprites[0][4  pLastDir], pX  24, pY  32, this     else If the player is moving         Draws player in a movement state facing the current direction         buffer.drawImagesprites[0][pAniStage  4  pLastDir], pX  24, pY  32, this      Drawing the buffer to the frame     g.drawImageoffscreen, 0, 0, this   public void updateGraphics g      paintg   codepre

Negative 67719 pIm having a hard time with sending REST requests with coderesourcecode to Laravel application. First of all, coderesourcecode POST method sendes Request Payload, which I am unable to read in Laravel, so I had to transform request to send codexwwwformurlencodedcode instead, and I had to put a function which serializes data in that format. Why isnt this by default p  pAnother problem is the PUT method, this time in Laravel. I found out that Laravel RESTful controllers dont support PUT methods. Instead, I should send POST request and include codemethod PUTcode as a parameter. Here is the improvised codep  precodefactoryUser,functionresource     return resourceapiPath  userid, ,          update              method POST,              params id id,              headers ContentType applicationxwwwformurlencoded,              transformRequest transform                codepre  pNow if I want to send a PUT request, I have to do something like thisp  precodevar userData  id 1, firstName John, lastName Doe userData.method  PUT User.updateuserData codepre  pSo instead of setting codemethodcode to codePUTcode each time manually when I want to make a PUT request, is there any way to make it default Or, am I doing something wrong, is there a better way to do this I really dont understand the whole REST thing, whats the point if its not well supported Laravel. Twitter API also only uses POST and GET. Please correct me if Im wrong. Thanks.p

Negative 67719 pI wrote a Spark program that mimics functionality of an existing Map Reduce job. The MR job takes about 50 minutes every day, but the Spark job took only 9 minutes Thats great p  pWhen I looked at the output directory, I noticed that it created 1,020 part files.  The MR job uses only 20 reducers so it creates only 20 files.  We need to cut down on  of output files otherwise our Namespace would be full in no time.p  pI am trying to figure out how I can reduce the number of output files under Spark.  Seems like 1,020 tasks are getting triggered and each one creates a part file. Is this correct Do I have to change the emlevel of parallelismem to cut down no. of tasks thereby reducing no. of output files  If so how do I set it  I am afraid cutting down no. of tasks will slow down this process  but I can test thatp

Negative 67719 pOn my website users have some images stored. I want to build a system where they can edit those images on website and save them. Edits are very basic like rotate, crop, enhance brightness add filters etc. strongIm trying to figure out how I can implement thisstrong.p  pMy understanding so far is that there are multiple ways in which I can do this. I can write all my image editing codeusing libraries on server side and then call this service API from my website. p  pI can also make all the changes on client side. I found PicMonkey library which would let me do it its flash based though so I dont really want to use it.p  pI also checked how flickr does it, they use this library a hrefhttpsdevelopers.aviary.com relnofollowhttpsdevelopers.aviary.coma which lets them do all the client side edits.p  pId like to know more about using these client side javascript libraries  such as aviary  what are the pros and cons of using them vs server side edits. What service component I need to write, if at all if Im using something like Avairy. More specifically, do I send image to server for modification or do I modify it on HTML canvas first and then send the modified image to server to save it.p

Negative 67719 pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq2710871427779This questiona asks whether one can use subscripting with codeCKRecordcode in Swift. While I already knew how to do what the questioner wanted, every permutation of it gives me a stack overflowp  precodesubscriptkey String gt CKRecordValue      get          return objectForKeykey as CKRecordValue          set          setObjectnewValue, forKey key       codepre  pThe stack overflow occurs in the getter. Ive never tried the setter, so it may occur there, too. Ive tried implementing with codeobjectForKeycode, codeobjectForKeyedSubscriptcode, and codevalueForKeycode. All produce the same result a stack overflow.p  pThis is very strange, since codeCKRecordcode is certainly written in ObjectiveC. Why would it recursively call Swifts codesubscriptcode method It makes no sense. Nate Cook, in his answer to the questioner, wonders why Swift doesnt bridge codeobjectForKeyedSubscriptcode automatically. Well, maybe the code to do that is not fully baked, but is causing this problem. I will have to try it with another class that has codeobjectForKeyedSubscriptcode.p  h1UPDATEh1  pIt appears that codeobjectForKeyedSubscriptcode is ordinarily bridged. I created a class in ObjectiveC with the appropriate methods, added it to the bridging header, and the indexers were there and compiled without issue. Even better, it worked without a stack overflow.p  pThis means that something very unusual is going on with codeCKRecordcode.p  h1A THEORYh1  pIf you create a class in Swift that descends from codeNSObjectcode and implements the codesubscriptcode method on it with a codeStringcode as the key, this becomes codeobjectForKeyedSubscriptcode. For pure Swift classes, I suspect this is not the case. You can verify this by importing your Swift class into ObjectiveC and verifying that codeobjectForKeyedSubscriptcode is there.p  pSince codeCKRecordcode descends from codeNSObjectcode, implementing codesubscriptcode overrides the default implementation. Further, it seems that codeobjectForKeycode and codevalueForKeycode all ultimately called codeobjectForKeyedSubscriptcode, which results in read is the same as a call to codesubscriptcode, which causes the stack overflow.p  pThat may explain why the stack overflow occurs. It still does not explain why codeobjectForKeyedSubscriptcode was not automatically bridged, but perhaps its because the definition of codesetObjectforKeyedSubscriptcode has a slightly different type signature from the canonical one code voidsetObjectid ltCKRecordValuegtobject forKeyedSubscriptNSString keycode. This makes no difference to ObjectiveC, but might trip up the bridging code. Swift is pretty new, after all.p

Negative 67719 pSo my project is a card type simulation. I have a Dealer, Player, and Heap class. The heap is a shared resource where the dealer places onenot multiple, just one card and the player will pick it up. I create two threads, one for a Dealer and one for a Player. The dealer is supposed to wait until he is notified that the player has picked up the card then he will proceed to place a new card down. Similarly, the Player will wait until he is notified that the dealer has placed a card down, and then the Player will pick the card up.p  pThere is also supposed to be a mechanism that both the Player and the Dealer will use to confirm that they are allowed to put or take a card from the Heap. I used a boolean if the boolean is true or false, the Player or the Dealer could or could not be allowed to do their corresponding actions.p  pIn the mean time, the Player and the Dealer are set to sleep for a random time interval, when they will then wake up and check to see if they can run their actions. If they cannot, they would wait until they are notified.p  pMy question involves the wait and notify methods. What is the difference between wait and sleep How would I make is to that the PlayerDealer would wake up from a sleep, and they are forced to wait until they are notified, if they are not allowed to takeadd a card from the heap Also, am I even doing the synchronization properlyp  pSorry that my code is really messy.

Negative 67719 pIve tried to search for this topic but I havent found what Im looking for, it could be that my terminology is off however. Im writing Java and coding in Eclipse Luna. p  pI currently have a program, and a set of tests related to that program that will produce a passfail result for each. What Im looking for is the ability to run one of these tests and retrieve a list of the lines of code both in the test file and the actual program that has been executed at some point during the test. What methods can be used to accomplish this The idea is to use that list later for fault localization if a test failed.p

I have an xml file called CacheInfo.xml that stores the details of cached pages.The default page has an entry in the xml called EnDefaultPage, which contains two child nodes. The child node LastUpdationTimeStamp stores, last updation timestamp unix timestamp in seconds  of the cache for Default page.p  pThe child node ExpiryTimestamp stores the timestamp at which the cache will be expired.So if the expiry timestamp is greater than lastupdation timestamp, the file from Cache will be loaded Default.html.Currently the script is working, but it is not routing to the Default.html although the conditional block that defines the route is being executed.I couldnt find the exact reason behind the issue.Can anybody suggest me a fix.All the other routes are working perfectly.

The expected behavior here is when the Open app button is clicked, the user gets redirected to the App Store app. However, we are seeing about a 10 seconds delay before the actual redirection happens. p  pSee videos belowp  pa hrefhttpswww.youtube.comwatchvdgh7vIsK8httpswww.youtube.comwatchvdgh7vIsK8ap  pa hrefhttpswww.youtube.comwatchvLFHeRnBFgghttpswww.youtube.comwatchvLFHeRnBFggap  pa hrefhttpswww.youtube.comwatchv82YkjpMywhttpswww.youtube.comwatchv82YkjpMywap  pNotesp  ol liI cant seem to reproduce this at all times. It is only reproducible sometimes. Sorryli liOnce a device is delayed for the first time, all subsequent links to AppStores will be fast, until roughly 1 day late. Rebooting the phone andor clearing the browser cache andor reinstall FacebookPinterest does not help reproducing this.li liI tried to replace the itmsapps link with a hrefhttpsitunes.apple.comusapptruspertipstutorialshowid578505616mt8httpsitunes.apple.comusapptruspertipstutorialshowid578505616mt8a, but we were still experiencing the delay from time to time.li liThe delay seems to be exactly 10 seconds.li ol  pWhy does this delay occur This seems like a bad user experience.p  pMy current theory is that the problem is on the Apple side. The reason being, once the Open app button is clicked, it is out of the hand of our website, as well as FacebookPinterest app. I presume, once the button is clicked, iOS is handling the actual context switch from one app to another. Therefore, it suggests that either the system call actually opening the URL is hanging, or the system call opening the App Store app is However, I havent been able to prove either one to be true or false. Does anyone have a better explanationp  p[Edit 04022015] I can confirm this problem still exists as of today on my phone iPhone 5S w iOS 8.2.

Negative 67719 pI have a problem building multiple Fortran90 executable targets using CMake, when I use Fortran modules that are shared by all executables, and build in parallel using codemake jcode.  The issue seems to be that the compiled object files are placed in different subdirectories for each target, codeCMakeFilestargetName.dirsrcfile.f90.ocode, while the module files are placed in the same directory for every target I can change this directory by setting codeFortranMODULEDIRECTORYcode, but it will still be the same dir for all module files.  The problem is then that all targets start writing these module files in parallel, and I get a codeFatal Error Cant rename module file module.mod0 to module.mod No such file or directorycode when using gfortran which apparently creates a .mod0 file and then renames it to .mod.  The problem does not arise when I issue make without the j option serial build.p  pI can see two solutions, but I dont know how to implement them.  Firstly, put the object files for all targets in the same directory rather than targetspecific directories.  This may be the preferred option, since I wont have to compile the shared source files N times for N targets.  The make process will then recognise that the object files exist, and not compile the corresponding source files again, hence not touching the .mod0 files again I may need to make all following targets depend on the first.p  pThe second solution would be to put the .mod0 files in the targetspecific directories, so that they are not overwritten or removed by the other targets.  This would solve my problem, even though it would still involve more compiling than necessary.  I have no idea how to accomplish either option, so any hint there or alternative solution is welcome.p

Negative 67719 pI am writing a product search module that uses faceted search. To simplify things a bit there are two entities product and price information. Since products can be sold by multiple web shops one product can have more price information records.p  pproductp  precode productguid  productcategory  productbrand codepre  ppriceInformationp  precode priceInformationguid  priceInformationprice  priceInformationproductguid codepre  pI list all products in a specific category and the user can filter by price range. The price ranges are listed with checkboxes, behind each price range you can see the number of products that match the search criteria. Price ranges that have no matches are not shown. For each price range I do a query to determine the number of matches facet count.p  precodeselect countdistinctproduct.productguid as count from product    INNER JOIN priceInformation ON product.productguid      priceInformation.priceInformationproductguid WHERE category beer    AND product.priceInformationprice gt 20   AND product.priceInformationprice lt 30 codepre  pEverything works fine but... because the number of ranges is growing this is just a simplified example I perform hundreds of queries every search. This is a big performance killer. I tried to get all the facet counts in one query but since there is a 1n relation between product and priceInformation the result is the number of prices that match, not the number of products.p  precodeselect CountCase WHEN product.priceInformationprice gt 20 AND                         product.priceInformationprice lt 30 THEN 1                    ELSE NULL END as Range2030,        CountCase WHEN product.priceInformationprice gt 30 AND                         product.priceInformationprice lt 40 THEN 1                    ELSE NULL END as Range3040 from product   INNER JOIN priceInformation ON product.productguid      priceInformation.priceInformationproductguid WHERE category beer codepre  pBottom line is that I miss the DISTINCT here.

Negative 67719 pI am a complete beginner with VI editor.p  pI had a chance of using the VI editor by typing codegit commitcode instead of codegit commit m my commentcode when commenting my commit to my git repository.p  pI learned that I would go into edit mode by pressing codeicode in the VI command line. And I also learned that I go back to the command mode by pressing either codeESCcode key or codeCtrl  [code key combination. However, neither keys get me out of the edit mode.p  pWhat happens is that pressing either keys do the same thing, something that seems like accumulating ESC key.

Negative 67719 pI have a model codeShopcode in my database which sum up everything I want to know about a shop codenamecode, codeurlcode, codepricecodep  pI would like some advise on what is the best way to deal with my situation. Basically, what I want is to scrap website which dont have API to get the price displayed on the page.p  pFor example, lets say that I want to get the price from this a hrefhttpsstore.motogp.comfrpilotesno46rossi1093497tshirtofficielyamaharossivr46.html relnofollowpagea, every time a user visit the page X and the price from this a hrefhttpsstore.motogp.comfrmotogptm176motogpvintage1773071vesteencuir.html relnofollowpagea every time he comes to the page Y and so on with 1000 pages.p  pThe codeShopscode in my database would be p  precodeShop 1  name gt Tshirt, url gt XXXXX, price gt PRICEFROMTHEURL Shop 2  name gt Veste, url gt XXXXX, price gt PRICEFROMTHEURL codepre  pI see two options to update the price every time a user ask it p  ol liStore the code to update the price in the database and evaluate it every time it is needed. Something like, adding a column codecodecode and do codeprice  evalShop.codecodeli liCall an action on my model according to the shop ID. Something like a switch case according to codeself.idcodeli ol  pI tried both options. Both works as expected, but my concerns is that option 1 looks like the ugly one but easier to maintain, while option 2 is not well fitted if you have 1000 shops to record and every one has a different scrapping method. I will end up with thousands of code line and it will become impossible to understand.p

Negative 67719 pIf a program requires multiple files of the same type, say 10 settings presets, what is the typical way of storing that information in filesp  pSo far, I have been creating a new file for each preset, so I have codePreset1.set, Preset2.set, Preset3.setcode, etc. To access them I will iterate through all files in the directory and read the ones with the code.setcode extension.p  pIm realizing now it may be more efficient and conventional to store all presets in a file called codePreset.setcode, and then write all preset configurations to the same file with some separating characters, say codecode.p  pIs there a difference in these methods Is one preferable to the otherp

Negative 67719 pIm having some confusion with the usage of the .size member function of vector.p  pSo what I have is an object that displays a series of bitmaps in sequence, these bitmaps are stored as pointers in a vector. This vector is then passed by reference amp in the construction of my animation object, which does all the work cycling through the bitmaps.p  pEverything works as I expected except that calling .size on my referenced vector of bitmap pointers, which does not return anything, though I know the vector has contents.p  pThis then causes the animation to cycle through normally, then it trips up because its trying to access an element that is out of bounds, due to .size returning nothing, messing up my bounds checking.p  pMy only guess is that my syntax is not correct, or that im not properly understanding the usage.p  precodeinclude animation.h include helperFunctions.h include ltvectorgt include ltiostreamgt  animationanimationint x, int y, SDLRenderer screenRenderer, stdvectorltSDLTexturegtamp sprites      x  x     y  y     sprites  ampsprites     frames   sprites.size  1this is to be used as an indexer, eg. 0 frames is 1 in reality, 3 is 4...     currentFrame  0first frame index     mainScreen  screenRenderer     finished  false   animationanimationconst animationamp orig     animationanimation      stdcout ltlt animation object deleted ltlt stdendl   void animationcycleFrame      applyTexturex, y, sprites[currentFrame], mainScreen     stdcout ltlt currentFrame  ltlt currentFrame ltlt stdendl     stdcout ltlt frames        ltlt frames ltlt stdendl     currentFrame     if currentFrame  frames          finished  true       codepre  pAlso I should add that im not asking for help with anything SDL, just the whole vector.size thing.p  pThank in advance, any help would be greatly appreciated.p  pUPDATEp  pSo I did some digging and it seems like .size is also returning as 0 on the vector before it is even being passed to the constructor... in main I havep  precodestdvectorltSDLTexturegt explosion16         explosion16.reserve16 for int i  0 i lt 16 i      explosion16[i]  loadTextureloadImagegfxexplosionsexplosion16e  tostringi  .bmp  cout ltlt explosion16.size   ltlt explosion16.size ltlt endlthis returns as zero, 0 codepre

Please explain it as simple as possible, Im a novice at IT.p
Negative 67719 pI got this error message  p  blockquote   pA foreign key value cannot be inserted because a corresponding primary key value does not exist. [ Foreign key constraint name  FKtTypeSystemtTypeConfig ]p blockquote  pHere is the situation  br  1 I create tables in local via codeSql Server CEcode. with foreign keys, in the right order br  2 Then I perform a codeSELECT  FROM [table]code statement from Server DB br  3 I insert via codeSqlCeBulkCopycode the statement result into the local table. br  br  And here happens the error. I dont understand why, I checked the create table order, the add constraint order. I also tried to add constraint via codeALTER TABLEcode instead of inside the Create statement.

Negative 67719 pIve started to learn java and Im confrunting with the following conditional expressionp  precode 1lt253lt4 codepre  pIn the book where Ive found this example it says that its a syntax error because it cant convert a numerical value to a boolean one. Same pages after, there is a test with different exercises, including this one.After writing and compiling in eclipse it gives me the output 5.

Does this provider have this built in Based on the comments on the blog post linked above which is also the ONLY documentation I can find on this it appears that I should be able to use the connectionString attribute to pass multiple hosts.

The same error occurs with or without this present in the connection string.p  pWith this in mind, here are my questions...p  ol liDoes this provider support Sentinel configurationsli liIf yes, what is the correct format for the connection stringli liDoes anyone have any other good documentation resources for this I havent even been able to find anything on Microsofts site outside of that blog post.li ol  pEDIT I should note, this is a custom, local Redis install.

This leads me to believe that this provider does not have Sentinel support. Can anyone confirm thisp

Negative 67719 pI created a PHP script that will be called once a day by the cron job.  The cron job works fine and creates a HTML Email template. I have a developmentlocalhost environment and a test environment.p  pMy only issue is inside the HTML Email template, there is an image that isnt rendering on my test environment. If I inspect the element, the image path is set to localhostimagesimagename.jpg. I dont understand why in test environment the path is set to localhost it should be testdomainimagesimagename.jpg instead of localhostimagesimagename.jpg.p  pIf I manually call the script through the browser in the url, I get the correct image path, and the image is fine in test environment. Why does it work when calling it manually and not when it is called by the cron jobp  pYes, Im autoloading the url helper in the autoload.php file.p  pHere is my image     codeltimg src. baseurl .imagesimagename.jpg alt gtcodep  pIm tempting to load the url helper inside the PHP file and wait tomorrow to see if that works.p  pAny ideas what is causing this problem p  pThanksp

I found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions21424919chromeparseintreturnsnanthis related questiona but Im not sure how I would escape any invalid characters.p  pJust as some background, the array is stored as a CLOB on an SQL DB. Im using Spring and Jackson on the server side to send a JSON object back, and within this object I have the array in question. Although I have access to the code on the server, I cant really change it because there are other applications that make requests to it. p

Negative 67719 pSo Ive been working on compiling a static version of MySQL and a hrefhttpspypi.python.orgpypimysqlclient2022MySQLclient relnofollowMySQLclientpythona. Ive been completely successful up to this point where Im trying to understand a libSystem.B.dylib dependency that MySQLclientpython has. p  pTo make it clear, MySQLclientpython is a python wrapper around the MySQL C Library. This results in the need to compile MySQLclientpython before it is used. This is currently working on OS X 10.7, and my goal is to create a compiled version of MySQLclientpython that will work on multiple versions of OS X bundling libmysql is already taken care of. Right now, I am compiling MySQLclientpython perfectly fine, and it works on 10.7. However, when its testing on 10.8, it breaks. To compile MySQLclientpython, Im using python 3.5 and running p  precodepython setup.py build codepre  pThis results in two things happening. First, a mysql.o object file is compiled using a command similar to a hrefhttpsgist.github.comalexggordone55e4518524e23a1ce11 relnofollowthisa. Then, a shared object file is compiled using a hrefhttpsgist.github.comalexggordon04dc816bae6ff18bbe02 relnofollowthis scripta. To be clear, those commands are mostly generated by setup.py.p  pThe resulting build has the structurep  precode.  setup.py  build      mysql.so      MySQLdb      mysqlexceptions.py codepre  pNow, when running p  precode otool L mysql.so mysql.so usrliblibSystem.B.dylib compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 159.1.0 codepre  pIt clearly shows theres a dependency on libSystem.B.dylib. Now dependencies arent an issue in general, and this works fine on 10.7. I can import the python module and use it correctly. However, when switching to 10.11, this same module no produces ap  precodeTraceback most recent call last   File ltstdingt, line 1, in ltmodulegt   File .MySQLdbinit.py, line 19, in ltmodulegt import mysql   ImportError dlopen.mysql.so, 2 Symbol not found      ZNSt8iosbase4InitD1Ev   Referenced from .mysql.so   Expected in flat namespace in .mysql.so codepre  pObviously, my first thought is that theres a problem with the dependency. I do believe that is the issue. To be honest though, Im not sure where to go from here. Obviously, OS X strongly discourages static linking, so I didnt look into that for long. Just to be clear once more, my goal is just to be able to use this on multiple OS X platforms 10.710.11 and this currently works on 10.7. Any ideasp

The way the code is currently I can only have one or the other on line 9 for codevar perrow  6code How can I make this work for both pages without breaking itp  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodejs langjs prettyprintoverridecodevar griddleprep  functionel         ifel.datainit             el.addClassgriddleinitialized             el.datainit,el.html                    var griddleupdate  functionel         var perrow  6,             windowwidth  window.width          instead of calculating heights were just going to piggyback breakpoints          to determine how many items are in each row, see griddle.scss         ifwindowwidthlt960             perrow  5                  ifwindowwidthlt768             perrow  4                  ifwindowwidthlt650             perrow  3                  ifwindowwidthlt530             perrow  2                     proceed with updating the markup         ifel.datainit               wipe out the existing markup and use the stored template             el.htmlel.datainit               wrap each row with a wrapper             var divs  el.children,                 markup  ltdiv classwrapper group griddlerowgt,                 i  0              divs.eachfunction                 ifigtperrow                     markup  ltdivgt                     markup  ltdiv classwrapper group griddlerowgt                     i  0                                  markup  this.wrapltdivgt.parent.html                 i                           markup  ltdivgt             el.htmlmarkup                    var griddlecleanup  functionel         var details  el.find.griddledetaildisplay         ifdetails.length             details.remove             el.find.griddleactive.removeClassgriddleactive                    var griddlepositionindicator  functionel,details         var indicatorleft  el.offset.left  parseIntel.outerWidth2,10         details.find.griddleindicator.cssleft,indicatorleftpx           var griddles  .griddle     ifgriddles.length          .griddledetails.hide           bind our details         body.onclick,.griddletrigger,functione             e.preventDefault             var this  this,                 row  this.parents.griddlerow,                 targetrowindex  row.index,                 griddle  row.parents.griddle,                 toggle  this.hasClassgriddleactive,                 currentrow  griddle.find.griddledetaildisplay,                 existingdetails  currentrow,                 currentrowindex  currentrow.prev.index,                 targetdetails  this.parents.griddleitem.find.griddledetails.clone.show.removeAttrid.addClassgriddledetaildisplay.hide              griddle.find.griddleactive.removeClassgriddleactive              iftoggle                 existingdetails.slideUpfast,function                     existingdetails.remove                              else                   is a current row already displayed                 ifcurrentrowindexgt1                       check to see if were just swapping out                     iftargetrowindexcurrentrowindex                          just swap it out                         currentrow.remove                         row.aftertargetdetails                         targetdetails.show                      else                           remove the nonapplicable row                         existingdetails.slideUpfast,function                             existingdetails.remove                                                    show the applicable row                         row.aftertargetdetails                         griddle.find.griddledetaildisplay.slideDownfast                                        else                       no current row, just slide it down                     row.aftertargetdetails                     griddle.find.griddledetaildisplay.slideDownfast                                   this.addClassgriddleactive                 griddlepositionindicatorthis,targetdetails                                 griddles.eachfunction             var griddle  this               going to grab the griddle HTML because were going to be swapping it in and out when resizing             griddleprepgriddle               init the rows             griddleupdategriddle               update the rows on resize             window.smartresizefunction                 griddlecleanupgriddle                 griddleupdategriddle                           codepre div div p
