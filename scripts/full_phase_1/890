Positive 890 pdoes anybody know how to use RequestScoped bean together with rendered attribute in jsf The rendered attribute is evaluated before applyValues phase and therefore is not correctly evaluated.

Positive 890 pI am trying to change a class attribute, which is styleClass in JSF terms for JSF components. To be more clear I am clicking on an anchor which in turn is supposed to toggle an image to an image that is checked which is an image itself.  Making the class of the image element into off when the page loads is no problem that is the desired result.p  pBut what I am trying to is when I click on the link, the image element that is being contained, should switch out the images through the JSFJava managed bean code which it does but the JavaScript that I coded should take care of changing the class name from off into on when the check version of the image is shown, does not work. It seems as though when I switch out from  the regular image to a check version of the image, JSF has some builtin JavaScript executing which negatesnullifies my JavaScript code to remove the off class name and add the on class name when I click on the link.p  pI understand that the switching of the images and the changing of the class name is done through 2 different methodologies, JSFJava amp JavaScriptjQuery at the same time. I need the class name as a flag to store which elements are checked and eventually use to display certain 3D models based on whats been checked. Checking isnt done through check boxes, but shown through the changing of images inside the anchors for a particular UX effect.p  pI need the JavaJSF way of switching out the images, because the boolean values help with sending out information in an email describing whats been checked.p  pThe jQuery library version is 1.11.0.p  pHopefully I explained this situation well if not let me know how to changeclear up the post for everyones convenience.p  pJSFp  precodelthpanelGroup idtaTab classiconchoices taTab layoutblockgt     ltpcommandLink actionListenerbuildYourOwnView.toggleBestAthlete titleBest Athlete updatetaTabgt         lthgraphicImage libraryimages namebuildYourOwnView.bestAthlete  bestathlete.png  bestathletecheck.png  altBest Athletegt     ltpcommandLinkgt     ltpcommandLink actionListenerbuildYourOwnView.toggleResengine titleResEngine updatetaTabgt         lthgraphicImage libraryimages namebuildYourOwnView.resengine  resenginecheck.png resengine.png  altResEnginegt     ltpcommandLinkgt  lthpanelGroupgt codepre  pJava filep  precodepackage com.website.presentation  import javax.faces.bean.ManagedBean import javax.faces.bean.ViewScoped  ManagedBean ViewScoped public class BuildYourOwnView   private boolean bestAthletefalse private boolean resenginefalse     Creates a new instance of BuildYourOwnView   public BuildYourOwnView    public void toggleBestAthlete      bestAthlete  bestAthlete   public void toggleResengine      resengine  resengine   public boolean isBestAthlete      return bestAthlete   public void setBestAthleteboolean bestAthlete      this.bestAthlete  bestAthlete   public boolean isResengine      return resengine   public void setResengineboolean resengine      this.resengine  resengine  codepre  pp  pJavaScriptp  precodeifthis.parent.taTab.childrena.childrenimgnot[class]      this.parent.taTab.childrena.childrenimg.addClassoff   .iconchoices gt a.clickfunction      console.loghello     ifthis.parent.hasClasstaTab           console.logtag         this.parent.taTab.childrena.childrenimg.eachfunction              console.logone each img iteration              ifthis.parent.taTab.childrena.childrenimg.hasClassoff                  this.parent.taTab.childrena.childrenimg.removeClassoff.addClasson                 console.logOff to on                          else if this.parent.taTab.childrena.childrenimg.hasClasson                  this.parent.taTab.childrena.childrenimg.removeClasson.addClassoff                 console.logOn to off                              codepre

Positive 890 pIm studying EJB and JSF. Information collected from various sources including SO made me understand this three pointsp  ol liStateful Session Beans have nothing to do with the HTTP session.li liHowever, a SFSB can be injected into a session scoped managed bean to maintain conversational state that is related to the business logic of an application.li liMoreover, CDI makes it possible to store a SFSB directly in the HTTP session for use inside EL expressions.li ol  pWhat is unclear to me is what happens to the SFSB directly or indirectly stored in the HTTP session whenp  ol liThe HTTP session expires or gets invalidated. I suppose that the SFSB, like any POJO left without references, would be garbage collected without waiting for it to timeout.li liThe SFSB timeouts but some session scoped managed bean still has a reference to it.li liThe Remove method of the SFSB was called but some session scoped managed bean still has a reference to it.li liThe managed bean is serialized by the container to save resources, eventually while the SFSB is in the passivated state.li liThe managed bean is deserialized by the container to restore the HTTP session, eventually while the SFSB is in the passivated state. li ol

Positive 890 pIn my test application JSF, PrimeFaces, Wildfly 8 I have a simple messaging interface for writing a message and viewing those that were sent to me. I now would like to create an automatic respond for those messages that were not answered after 5 minutes. This automatic respond is meant to be independent of any person sitting behind the browser window and clicking the refresh button.p  pMy current idea is to create a new class annotated with ApplicationScoped. This class shall run an individual thread handling the responding process. Would that be a good approach Or is there a functionality somewhere that already covers this matterp

The demo in the blog post uses Entity Framework, while the live application uses POCO.emp  pI am trying to figure out why Entity framework is returning a fixed width string for fields that are set up as nvarcharMAX.  By Fixed Width, I mean something like DC        , where theres white space at the end of the content of the string.  p  pIn the demo file, which is connected to an included MDF file, the Name field is a nvarcharmax field, and entity framework correctly returns the trimmed string.

When I hover over the codereturn this.itemPrefixcode line of Entity Model C file at runtime, it shows the item with the white space, untrimmed.

Negative 890 pI currently have a GridView inside a ListView.View.  The GridView columns will far exceed the width of the screen, so there will always be horizontal scrolling.p  pWhat I would like to do is to have certain columns always remain on the screen regardless of scrolling.

Negative 890 pMy question is related to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1000674turnoffbufferinginpipeTurn off buffering in pipea albeit concerning Windows rather than Unix.p  pIm writing a Make clone and to stop parallel processes from thrashing each others console output Ive redirected the output to pipes as described in a hrefhttpsupport.microsoft.comkb190351 relnofollowherea on which I can do any filtering I want. Unfortunately longrunning processes now buffer up their output rather than sending it in realtime as they would on a console.p  pFrom peeking at the MSVCRT sources it seems the root cause is that GetFileType is used to check whether the standard IO handles are attached to a console, which then sets an internal flag and ends up disabling buffering.p  pApparently a separate array of inheritable file handles and flags can also be passed on through the undocumented lpReserved2 member of the STARTUPINFO structured when creating the process. About the only working solution Ive figured out is to use this list and just lie about the device type when setting the flags for stdoutstderr.p  pNow then... Is there any isanei way of solving this problemp

Negative 890 pI am working on a Java applet that uses javax.sound.midi.sequencer to play a MIDI sequence.  In order for this to work, the visitor needs to have a soundbank installed on hisher computer. Apparently, the Windows JRE doesnt come with a soundbank, and one has to be downloaded separately from a hrefhttpjava.sun.comproductsjavamediasoundsoundbanks.html relnofollowhttpjava.sun.comproductsjavamediasoundsoundbanks.htmla .  However, it is possible to load a soundbank from a file without having to go through the installation process.  So, that brings me to my question does anyone know where I can find a redistributable open source JavaSoundcompatible soundbank Alternatively, is there any way that I can legally redistribute Suns soundbanks from the URL above, without redistributing the entire JRE  I want to have a soundbank that my applet can load onthefly from a file.p

Negative 890 pUsing Ruby on Rails, how can I achieve a polymorphic codehasmanycode relationship where the owner is always of a known but the items in the association will be of some polymorphic but homogenous type, specified by a column in the owner  For example, suppose the codeProducercode class codehasmanycode products but producer instances might actually have many Bicycles, or Popsicles, or Shoelaces.  I can easily have each product class Bicycle, Popsicle, etc. have a codebelongstocode relationship to a Producer but given a producer instance how can I get the collection of products if they are of varying types per producer instancep  pRails polymorphic associations allow producers to belong to many products, but I need the relationship to be the other way around.  For examplep  precodeclass Bicycle lt ActiveRecordBase   belongsto producer end  class Popsicle lt ActiveRecordBase   belongsto producer end  class Producer lt ActiveRecordBase   hasmany products, polymorphiccolumn gt type  last part is madeup... end codepre  pSo my Producer table already has a type column which corresponds to some product class e.g. Bicycle, Popsicle, etc. but how can I get Rails to let me do something likep  precodegtgt bikeproducer.products gt [Bicycle123, Bicycle456, ...] gtgt popsicleproducer.products gt [Popsicle321, Popsicle654, ...] codepre  pSorry if this is obvious or a common repeat Im having surprising difficulty achieving it easily.p
Negative 890 pPlease see the code below. What I am trying to do is to store some PDF file names in XML format inside a database PDFStorage field. The code kind of works but is not polished enough If there is no data for a row then I am putting a hardcoded xml file and then manipulating Uploading new PDF Deleting PDF using a GridView control. The end result is that, if there is no data in a field I am reading an string variable with some junk file name and then showing that inside the GridView. It would be nice to not have to do that If no data in the database then dont show the default PDF file name. Note, I will need this XML structure to be read in another application and so Ive got to have the XML store the PDF file names in the format as in the code below.

Negative 890 pI plan on writing a WPF app following the MVVM pattern for the first time but something is not quite clear to me.  Lets say that the view has a Save button and when that is hit I need to save the current state of my data the model.  This will be done by sending a SOAP message to a SOAP service.p  pWhere in my MVVM setup do these SOAP requestresponse handlers live  Does the view model make the SOAP call itself whenever the save button is hit Should the view model notify the model to save itself instead  Maybe its some other way, completely separate from the MVVM  p  pMy thinking was that at least in this specific case the view model would handle it since it needs to disable the save button in the view until the current save request has completed.p

Negative 890 pIm in the process of moving a working apachemodphp website to nginxphpfpm.p  pUnder Apachemodphp, I could use codeheaderLocation urlcode to redirect the browser to a different page, such as after a login attempt. After switching to nginxphpfpm, the browser would no longer follow that redirect on certain pages. I confirmed with Firebug and Httpfox that the header Location [url] was actually being received in the response. This behavior also appears in Chrome not tested in IE.p  pSo I did a few experiments, read a few things about http, and made it work, but Im not sure why it works or why it didnt.p  pThe solution I came up with was to send a Status 303 header before the Location [url] header.

It worked with Status 200 under Apache.p  pIs the Status header required to use the Location header Or was Apache doing something else to make it work Ive not changed any of the php code involved other than the codeheaderStatus 303code line that made it work.

Negative 890 pI have a couple of code projects in CPython in which LaTeXformat descriptions and labels are used to generate PDF documentation or graphs made using LaTeXpstricks. However, we also have some plain text outputs, such as an HTML version of the documentation I already have code to write minimal markup for that and a nonTeXenabled plot renderer.p  pFor these I would like to eliminate the TeX markup that is necessary for e.g. representing physical units. This includes nonbreaking thin spaces, text, mathrm etc. It would also be nice to parse down things like frac12 into 12 for the plain text output and use MathJax for the HTML. Due to the system that weve got at the moment, I need to be able to do this from Python, i.e. emideallyem Im looking for a Python package, but a nonPython executable which I can call from Python and catch the output string would also be fine.p  pIm aware of the a hrefhttptex.stackexchange.comquestions6431optionsforconvertinglatextoplaintextsimilar question on the TeX StackExchange sitea, but there werent any really programmatic solutions to that Ive looked at detex, plasTeX and pytex, which they all seem a bit dead and dont really do what I need programmatic conversion of a TeX string to a representative plain text string.p  pI could try writing a basic TeX parser using e.g. pyparsing, but a that might be pitfallladen and help would be appreciated and b surely someone has tried that before, or knows of a way to hook into TeX itself to get a better resultp  pstrongUpdatestrong Thanks for all the answers... it does indeed seem to be a bit of an awkward request I can make do with less than general parsing of LaTeX, but the reason for considering a parser rather than a load of regexes in a loop is that I want to be able to handle nested macros and multiarg macros nicely, and get the brace matching to work properly. Then I can e.g. reduce txtirrelevant macros like text and mathrm first, and handle txtrelevant ones like frac last... maybe even with appropriate parentheses Well, I can dream... for now regexes are not doing such a terrible job.p

Negative 890 pI am keen to write a library project with tests, even if I then include the code in other projects as opposed to linking to the lib. for inclusion on ios projects.p  pIt seems checking the Include unit tests isnt enough for xcode 4 to properly initialise a project with tests, and after looking through the Apple documentation I cant find anything relevant.p  pDoes anybody know of any resources or tutorials for getting this workingp  pEven with the default Cocoa Touch Static Library project, upon choosing Test from the Product menu, it fails when linking with this error the project is called codetest1codep  precodelibrary not found for ltest1 Command DeveloperPlatformsiPhoneOS.platformDeveloperusrbinllvmgcc4.2 failed with exit code 1 codepre  pAny help would be much appreciated.p

Negative 890 pI am currently using the CodeBlocks IDE, c, opengl and SDL to make a game and I have hit a severe block in road, if you will. I am using SDLimage to load these jpg images for the textures, but they just will not load. Currently, I have tried placing them in every folder in the project, even places where it would supposedly make no difference. I have tried running both the debug and release versions from the IDE, by doubleclicking the executable, and by running the executable from the command line. They all produce the same error Could not load image the path to my image. I have tried using full paths, I have tried using relative paths, I have tried just about everything. I have tried various image formats, to no success. Other useful information may be I am using ubuntu 11.04, I am using GIMP to create the images, and this is my code in complete Im sure most of it is irrelevant, but I am just putting it all down

Negative 890 pFirst Ill explain a little bit about my system here. Its a form to allow children to book onto a series of day courses that run in the school easter and summer breaks. The form allows registration of two children simultaneously, and if the dates for both children are the same, the sibling has a 5 discount for their dates.p  pOn the form, there is a date section which is a series of checkboxes. As you check the checkboxes a total price is calculated at the bottom of the page.p  pThe single child price is 29 and the sibling rate for those dates that match up to the first child is 24. There is an additional 16.50 charge for booking onto the horseriding course  but this logic error only extends to the date selection.p  pFor some reason, which I cannot fathom, in Internet Explorer the price for registering 2 children appears 5 less that it should.

Is there is any way to get that value synchronously, like waiting for a function till its execution is over.p  pHere is sample code p  precode   var textReceived     function callbackFunction            textReceived getTextfromProcess          function chkProc             process.addEventListenerSTANDARDOUTPUTDATA, callbackFunction           This is AIRs function which give text asynchronously         function sqlExcsql         chkProc        wait here before returning    return   textReceived     codepre  pAs JavaScript runs on single thread, I can not use infinite loop with break. Is there any way of achieving thisp

Negative 890 pI am creating a radar chart to display data and it works just fine. However, the titles that appear in the legend can be extremely long.

The tag cloud will be displayed in descending order and using the same font size, its not the display algorithm, but the search algorithm I should implement.  Im using mysql and php.

Negative 890 pI am trying to find the best solution to essentially replace a SQL database in a solution that is currently under development, but is working. The data store needs to to include table partitioning and file groups that can be backed up andor rolled inout such as described in IBM DB2 partitioning here a hrefhttpwww.ibm.comdeveloperworksdatalibrarytecharticledm0605ahuja2index.html relnofollowhttpwww.ibm.comdeveloperworksdatalibrarytecharticledm0605ahuja2index.htmla, but also allow mass row insertupdates.p  pThe tables stored in the SQL database currently have a simple structure ID long PRIMARY KEY TimeStamp DateTime PRIMARY KEY Value float Attribute intp  pThe ID is not related to any ID in the current database but comes from elsewhere. The ID and Timestamp together are used as the primary key for insertingupdating p  pdata in the table. Currently, a stored procedure with a TableValued Parameter is used from .NET to allow for data to be merged into the table 50K rows at a time. Currently I have measured around 10K entriess on the development machine, which I am happy with. However, as the solution is cost sensitive, and due to performance requirements as the table grows, I need the ability to do table partitioning ranged by the TimeStamp field and divide the partitions among multiple files for simplified maintenancebackup. In addition, I need the ability for a customer to execute queries read only on the data, at minimum, via ODBC. p  pI have looked at a couple of NoSQL options, mySQL, and DB2 which seems to be the closest fit right now. I would appreciate any insight anyone has as to what the best fit may be. There is of course always the option to move the partitioning logic into the code, but Id like to avoid that if possible.p

Negative 890 pIs it possible to write to a 3rd output stream  My situation is that I have an a number of scripts that execute various commands, remotely across a grid of machines.   Those commands result in stdout and stderr. I would however like to feedback progress to the central controlling machine, without cluttering it with the interlaced stdout and stderr of the various machines in the grid.  I was thinking that if it is possible to write to a 3rd output stream, that I could use it for specific status events from the grid, that the controlling script can report on, meanwhile stdout and stderr can remain redirected to log files for debugging should something go wrong. For what it is worth I will probably be implementing this in ruby, and the machines involved will be a mixture of windows and unix machines.p

Negative 890 pI need to make interop calls to a DLL written in C. In the C code, there are various functions that receive and return strings. These all use a commonly defined type struct in C, which comprises a pointer to a string along with an integer for its size as followsp  precodestruct StringParam      int size     4 byte integer for the size of the string buffer     LPWSTR buff  Pointer to a wide char buffer  codepre  pWhen a string is returned from the DLL and when the string buffer is too small to store the string result, an error code is returned along with the correct size buffer that is required in the integer emsizeem field, so that the caller can provide the right size buffer.p  pIgnoring the struct for the moment, this could be easily accomplished through interop using the combination of a StringBuilder parameter, along with a ref int parameter for the size. However, we are using a struct and StringBuilder fields are not permitted in structs that are marshalled.p  pGiven a C function that receives a string as followsp  precodeint stdcall DoSomethingWithStringStringParam stringParam codepre  pOne can declare the following struct in Cp  precode [StructLayoutLayoutKind.Sequential, CharSet  CharSet.Unicode]  internal struct StringParam        public int Size      [MarshalAsUnmanagedType.LPWStr]      public string Text       public StringParamstring text                this.Text  text          this.Size  text.Length         codepre  pand can successfully initialize a struct and call a C function with the following signaturep  precode[DllImportCustom.dll, CharSet  CharSet.Unicode] public static extern int DoSomethignWithStringref StringParam stringParam codepre  pHowever, given a function that needs to return a string as follows, presents a problemp  precode[DllImportCustom.dll, CharSet  CharSet.Unicode] public static extern int GetSomeStringref StringParam stringParam codepre  pWhen receiving a string from the interop call, we do not know the size of the string and must allocate a buffer sufficient in size for storing the string result. StringBuilder would be ideal, but cannot be used within a struct that is marshalled. We could preallocate the string with 2048 dummy characters, which could then be used to store the results. This is in fact recommended in the error message one gets when attempting to use the StringBuilder typep  blockquote   pCannot marshal field Text of type StringParam Struct or class fields cannot be of type StringBuilder. The same effect can usually be achieved by using a String field and preinitializing it to a string with length matching the length of the appropriate buffer.p blockquote  pThis seems kind of messy to preinitialize a string with dummy values.

Negative 890 pI need some help understanding how 32 bit applications use memory on a 64 bit OS.p  pA 32 bit application can use 2 gb of memory on 64 bit OS, correct Does this mean that 3 32 bit applications running in parrallel could address 6 gb of memory...

As long as a single request to that webservice always stays under 2gb of memory usage, is there any point in recompiling to 64 bit My theory is that IIS creates a new process for each request, so the whole pool of processes will be able to make use of all the memory the 64bit machine has , 8 or 15 or 20 gig or whatever.p  pLet me know your thoughts, thanksp

Negative 890 pI have created a project which uses a MySQLdatabase in a very basic way. This means I only use SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE. No joins, no table creation. Most queries are SELECTs and most of the time I only select some rows of one record.p  pIm also quite sure that this project will always use MySQL.p  pNow Ive heard about a hrefhttpphp.netmanualenbook.pdo.php relnofollowPDOa and some people seem to think that its in general a good idea to use it. According to php.net PDO provides [only] a dataaccess abstraction layer.p  pIs there any reason why a project which will always use MySQL should use PDO Any reason why it might be a bad idea to use PDO in such a projectp

Negative 890 pI am using AndEngine for a live wallpaper project, though I imagine my problem should be universal to Android or even Java entirely.  Until recently I was using SVGs for my images due to the scaling benefits, however because of the graphical limitations of vector art I decided to switch to PNG, and I cant seem to figure out how to get the HSV colorization I had before to apply to the new sprites properly.p  pAt the moment I am basically just shoving some HSV values at the sprite, and it does technically work, but not properly.  I dont seem to have any real control over the saturation or valuebrightness at all like I did before, there only seems to be two levels to them, as if they were being set to 0.0 or 1.0 instantly, though the color itself is very dark and obviously not at full valuebrightness and saturation either way.p  pI dont see any real difference between what I am doing and what the setup I had for the SVG images was, so I am at a bit of a loss.  Presumably somewhere in the depths of AndEngine there was something else being done to make it all work properly, and I just dont know what it is to work it in now.  The relevant code that I am using, more or less, is p  precode        float[] temphsv  new float[3]         int colorAfter  0          Sprite tempSprite  new Spritex, y, 400, 600, mSprite         temphsv[0]  120         temphsv[1]  1.0f         temphsv[2]  1.0f         colorAfter  Color.HSVToColortemphsv         tempSprite.setColorColor.redcolorAfter, Color.greencolorAfter, Color.bluecolorAfter codepre  pTechnically the way that code is right now the image should be just pure bright green, but instead it is instead a rather dark green and still retaining its shading.  I imagine this is something trivial since it worked fine with the SVG images, so any tip on what Im missing would be great.p

For example, when it finds the  element with a rowspan of 2, it should not continue onto the next  element, because the rowspan is attached to the next  element.  BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, I need to loop through the rowspans for codelttrgtcode elements.p  pExample, if I have this table setupp  precodelttable width100gt     lttr classtablerow0gt         lttd classtablecol0 rowspan2gtContentlttdgt         lttd classtablecol1gtContentlttdgt         lttd classtablecol2gtContentlttdgt     lttrgt     lttr classtablerow1gt         lttd classtablecol1gtMore Contentlttdgt         lttd classtablecol2gtSome More Contentlttdgt     lttrgt     lttr classtablerow2gt         lttd classtablecol1gtAnd Yet More Contentlttdgt         lttd classtablecol2gtContentlttdgt         lttd classtablecol3gtContentlttdgt     lttrgt lttablegt codepre  pThan it will need to get the last codelttrgtcode in here with codeclasstablerow2code because the rowspan only covers codetablerow0code and codetablerow1code.p  pHopefully you get what I mean, it needs to be able to loop within the codelttdgtcode elements and only do something when the coderowspancode quantity has been exceeded for those codelttrgtcode elements in the table.  The rowspan can be more than 2, Im just simplifying this for people to grasp what Im asking here.  Also, there can be more than 1 codelttdgtcode element with a rowspan greater than 1 so, it should be able to know this as well.  Im thinking I will need to build an array of rowspans here, and the array length will be based on each codelttdgtcode rowspan value.p

Negative 890 pHow can one validate an XML file using an XSD in Java We dont know the schema in advance. I would like to be able to get the codeschemaLocationcode, download the XSD, cache it and then perform the actual validation. p  pThe problem is, that with codejavax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuildercodecodeDocumentBuilderFactorycode classes I cant seem to be able to get a hold of the codeschemaLocationcode in advance. Whats the trick for this Which classes should I look intop  pPerhaps theres a more suitable API I can use The whole problem is that we need to validate dynamically, without necessarily having the XSDs locally.p  pHow could one get a hold of the URL of codeschemaLocationcode defined in the XSD filep  pI know you can set featuresattributes, but thats a different thing.

Negative 890 pI am generating very large hex grids up to 120k total hexes at 32px wide hexes results in over 12k wide images and Im trying to find an efficient way to bind these to OpenGL textures in libgdx. I was thinking of using multiple FBOs and breaking the grid up as necessary into tiles, but Im not sure how to ensure continuity between the FBOs. I cant start with one massive FBO, because that is backed up by a texture so it would fail from trying to load it to video memory. I cant use a standard bitmap on the heap because I need the drawing functionality of an OpenGL surface.p  pSo what I was thinking was I would need to overdraw on the FBOs and somehow pick up on the next FBO emexactlyem where the previous left off. However Im not sure how to go about this. Im drawing the hex grid with a series of hexagonal meshes, FYI.p  pOf course, theres probably some other much simpler and more efficient way to do this that Im not even thinking of, which is why I pose this question to you fine peoplep

Negative 890 pIm trying to work out how to do this.p  pNOTE Im not an experienced objectivec developer hence why Im using PhoneGap in the first placep  pstrongThe short of itstrong My UIWebView no, not the PhoneGap one that renders the webapp, a 2nd UIWebView created inmemory and not visible is not rendering into the PDF.

It seems to render its UIWebView quite fine with it not being visible.p  pIm currently experimenting with rendering the actual PhoneGap UIWebView into the PDF as opposed to my own UIWebView. But this is not ideal.p  ul lipIt means I have to hide all toolbars and whatnot, and then empanem the UIWebView around so I capture everything outside the viewport. This is not ideal, because the user will visually see this occurringpli lipPoint 1 above doesnt seem to work anyway, because iPad is too slow to update the screen when dynamically fiddling with the layout. On iPad, if you do visual things very quickly, like panning the screen around the iPad is too slow and just wont show it. You end up only seeing the end state. So when I take the screenshots, the screen visually hasnt panned even though the DOM says it has. Hope that makes sense.pli ul  pAgh, frustrating.p
Negative 890 pI have a .NET WCF service with a few operation contracts that takes a DateTimeOffset. The idea is to avoid any confusion with DST and time zones.p  pHowever I am in doubt that using DateTimeOffset is a good idea after all, since it is fairly nonstandard and would cause headaches for anyone trying to connect with, say, a Java application or a .NET application bound to an older .NET version.p  pAn alternative is to expect a UTC DateTime, but this introduces the risk that someone will forget to use UTC time and call the service with a local time. I could also expect a local time DateTime, since clients will always be in the same timezone, but this leaves some subtle, but classic, ambiguity around DST changes.p  pDoes anyone have headache stories with DateTimeOffset in a service interface or is it relatively unproblematic to use after allp

Negative 890 pI have to admit I am not familiar with ANT and did not write most of the code below from scratch. What I am trying to do is loop through a list of filenames which is saved in a file seperated by commas. The code executes fine until it gets to somewhere around the 1400th filename. For each filename, it is calling a java procedure that executes a query to retrieve a pdf file and save it locally. I believed it may be running out of memory because the connection that is opened in the Java procedure isnt closed but I confirmed it is. So I think its due to the list of filenames being too large. Any ideas on how to deal with large listsp  pThe error I get after around the 1400th iteration is java.lang.OutOfMemoryError  unable to create new native threadp  pThanks.p  precodeltfor listfilenames delimiter, paramfilenamegt     ltsequentialgt             ltpropertyregex overrideyes propertytrimmedname inputfilename regexp[s][s].[s][s] replace1gt             ltifgt                 ltandgt                 ltlength stringtrimmedname trimtrue whengreater length0 gt                 ltnotgtltequals arg1trimmedname arg2filenames gtltnotgt                 ltandgt             ltthengt                 ltjava classnameLOBExtract failonerrortrue forktrue maxmemory512mgt                     ltarg valueDBSERVERservernamegt                     ltarg valueDBPORToracleportgt                     ltarg valueDBSIDoraclesidgt                     ltarg valueDBUSERdbusergt                     ltarg valueDBPASSWORDdbpasswordgt                     ltarg valueTABLEBLOBDATAgt                     ltarg valueLOBFIELDBLOBDATAgt                     ltarg valueWHEREblobidtrimmednamegt                     ltarg valueFILENAMEoutputdiraircraftesigfilestrimmedname.pdfgt                     ltclasspathgt                         ltpathelement location.gt                         ltpathelement pathbasedirgt                         ltpathelement pathbasedirresourceojdbc14.jargt                     ltclasspathgt                 ltjavagt             ltthengt             ltifgt         ltsequentialgt ltforgt codepre

Negative 890 pI would like to hide a control such as a TextBox when it has a binding on a property such as the Text property that is invalid has thrown a BindingExpression path error. This is different from simply checking to see if the bindings value is null in a trigger. Null may in fact be a perfectly acceptable value, and the control should still be displayed. Basically I have a DataTemplate that I want to reuse with several different types of objects from my VM, some of which may have certain properties in common, and some of them may have unique properties. When a particular property does not exist on the object that is currently the binding source of the DataTemplate, the DataTemplate will have some sort of additional trigger or binding that will hide the particular control that is bound to the property that does not exist.p

Negative 890 pIve implemented a Deauthorize Callback for my canvas app. It would appear that Facebook is unable to ping the Deauthorize Callback over https, but it has no problem with http.

Negative 890 pI have a large set of data which Im trying to represent in 3D hoping to spot a pattern. Ive spent quite some time reading, researching and coding, but then I realized my main problem is NOT the programming, but actually strongchoosing a way to visualize the datastrong.p  pMatplotlibs mplot3d offers a lot of options wireframe, contour, filled contour, etc, and so does MayaVi. But there are so many choices and each with its own learning curve that Im practically lost and dont know where to start So my question is essentially which plotting method would YOU use if you had to deal with this datap  pMy data is datebased. For each point in time, I plot a value the list Actual.p  pBut for each point in time, I also have an Upper limit, a Lower limit, and a midrange point. These limits and midpoints are based on a seed, in different planes.p  pI want to spot the point or identify the pattern when, or before, a major change happens in my Actual reading. Is it when the upper limits on all planes meet Or approach one another Is it when the Actual value touches an UpperMiddleLower limit Is it when Uppers in one plane touch the Lowers of another planep  pIn the code Im pasting, Ive reduced the data set to just a few elements.

Negative 890 pI came across an interesting error when I was trying to link to an MSVCcompiled library using MinGW while working in Qt Creator. The linker complained of a missing symbol that went like codeimpFunctionNamecode. When I realized That it was due to a missing extern C, and fixed it, I also ran the MSVC compiler with FAcs to see what the symbols are. Turns out, it was codeimpFunctionNamecode which is also the way Ive read on MSDN and quite a few guru bloggers sites.p  pIm thoroughly confused about how the MinGW linker complains about a symbol beginning with codeimpcode, but is able to find it nicely although it begins with codeimpcode.

When the browser attempts the codePOSTcode process, it first sends an codeOPTIONScode header to the server requesting allowed codeOPTIONScode for the subsequent post. This is where we would like to see the headers weve configured in the CORS Support WCF extension being passed back, however we arent getting that far before the response comes  back as em401 Unauthorizedem, I believe this is to do with the transport security binding configuration requesting NTLM, but Im not sure. p  pAlso, Im not very experienced with this, but I havent seen much information about codePOSTcode using codeapplicationjsoncode content type as opposed to codetextplaincode when performing cross domain requests.p  pI know that people will probably suggest codeJSONPcode as the one true solution, Im not against different approaches, indeed I encourage anyone to suggest best practices as it would help others reading this question later. However, please attempt to answer the question before suggestion alternatives to it.p  pMany thanks in advance for anyone who contributes.p  ppeteski p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pIt appears that Chrome 20.x.x doesnt suffer the problem of not negotiating NTLM to retrieve the codeOPTIONScode header response from the server, but Firefox 13.0.1 does. p  pWeve also noticed that someone has already posted a bug up on the Firefox forum, which weve added information top  pa hrefhttpbugzilla.mozilla.orgshowbug.cgiid751552httpbugzilla.mozilla.orgshowbug.cgiid751552a p  pstrongPlease vote for this bug to be fixed on the bugzilla sitestrongp  pUsing the following code, we can watch the network trace to see Firefox failing and Chrome working fine p  precodevar url  httpmyWebServiceServerInstantMessagingServicechatmessagesend var data   remoteUserUri  sipfoo.barmydomain.com, message  This is my message              var request  new XMLHttpRequest                      request.openPOST, url, true request.withCredentials  true request.setRequestHeaderContentType, applicationjson                    request.senddata                      console.logrequest codepre  pOn a separate note, IE8 doesnt support the codeXMLHttpRequestcode for cross domain calls, favouring its own magical codeXDomainRequestcode object, so weve got some work to do in changing the client side code to handle IE8 vs the world cases.

It looks like were going to have to create our own custom token authentication and pass it across to the WCF service in a cookie, or in IE8s case, codePOSTcode it with the JSON. The WCF service will then have to handle decrypting the data and using that instead of the codeServiceSecurityContext.Current.WindowsIdentitycode we previously had access to with NTLM auth.p

Negative 890 pIm trying to write a thin wrapper around some C classes to call them from Python. The specific problem is that if codevirtualcode is uncommented below then attempting to create a codeFoocode crashes the interpreter. Im not interested in rewriting this code as Boostpython, SWIG or Pyxxx to solve this problem  this is an extract from a much larger system I would like to know why it happens, although if either of those libraries solves this problem I would love to know how they implement it. If I setup an extension module and register types in the system then the calls from the Python interpreter work without any problems, either using codeextern Ccode or just having static members in a class to register in the slots for the Python type.p  pIf I declare a member to be virtual, then attempting to call it within a call from the Python interpreter causes a crash with bad memory access. The address accessed is the offset that I get if I print out the class member as a pointer. I have specific code to follow, but the basic question is does something in the C runtime environment called by Python screw up the despatch of virtual class member functions Python is v2.6.7 and the C extension is being compiled by GCC 4.2.1. There are related questions that suggest Boostpython supports this, are they doing it directly or simulating it through class member functionsp  precode PythonType is a class that inherits from PyTypeObject and fills in defaults ...  extern C int initHookPyObject self, PyObject args, PyObject kwds class Foo  public static PythonType thePyType   static void registerTypePyObject module        thePyType.tpinit  initHook     PyTypeReadyampthePyType     PyModuleAddObjectmodule, thePyType.tpname, PyObjectampthePyType       virtual void insert        printfInsertedn     PythonType FoothePyTypeFoo,sizeofFoo extern C    int initHookPyObject self, PyObject args, PyObject kwds        Fooselfgtinsert     codepre

Only reloadData would at least redrawrefresh each cell, even though most examples say setNeedsLayout on the cell should have worked.p  pWhat happens is the checkboxes change correctly when clicked, however if I checkmark one cell, then I click to highlight the cell, the checkbox is unchecked until the view scrolls offscreen and then back.  I assumed the problem is related to there being different views for selected vs notselected, but beyond that not sure what to check.p  pstrongEditstrong As most tutorials use code similar to this, here is what I have also tried, but in this usage the image never changes until cells are scrolled off and back on screen, even though I can set breakpoints and see that the cellForRowAtIndexPath is being called for each cell again after reloadData is called in my click event, and it is correctly setting the image to checked for the item I checkedp  precode IBActionCheckClickedidsender      UITableViewCell cell  UITableViewCell [[sender superview] superview]     NSIndexPath indexPath  [[self tableView] indexPathForCellcell]     Message rec  Message Records[indexPath.row]     rec.Checked  rec.Checked     [self.tableView reloadData]     UITableViewCell tableViewUITableView tableView cellForRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath      UITableViewCell cell  [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifierCell]      NOTE In my testing cell is never NULL, so I have no checking here.

Since the gadget itself cannot do that but the button that initiates it is in the gadget, what is the actual method to link the button trigger with the server side code calling the IMAP function Ive seen lots of answers instructing people that they need to do this, but I am stumped on the actual implementation. Also, would that mean changing the scope of my widget since IMAP can pretty much doaccess anything email relatedp  pSorry for muddling several questions there, but I am pretty confused. thanks for any help on this...p

Negative 890 pI want to access with selenium through python, a URL that demands authentication.

Negative 890 pI want to load 4channel texture data from a file in iOS, so I consider the texture as a continuous mapp  precode[0,1]x[0,1] gt [0,1]x[0,1]x[0,1]x[0,1] codepre  pIf I use the fileformat code.pngcode, XCodeiOS consider the file as an image, and so multiplies each component codergbcode with codeacode premultiplied alpha, corrupting my data. How should I solve this Examples may bep  ul liuse two textures with components codergbcode 3channelli lipostdivide alphali liuse another file formatli ul  pOf these, I consider the best solution to be to use another file format. The GLcompressed file format PVRTC is not Appleplatform independent and seems to be of low resolution 4 bits a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentation3DDrawingConceptualOpenGLESProgrammingGuideTechniquesForWorkingWithTextureDataTechniquesForWorkingWithTextureData.htmlapplerefdocuidTP40008793CH104SW3 relnofollowreferencea.p  pEDIT If my own answer below is true, it is not possible to get the 4 channel data of pngs in iOS. Since OpenGL is about creating images rather than presenting images, it should be possible to load 4channel data in some way. png is a fileformat for images deland compression depends on all 4 channelsdel but compression of one channel is independent of the other channels, so one may argue that I should use another file format. So which other compressed file formats should I use, which is easy to readintegrated in iOSp  pUPDATE combinatorial mentioned a way to load 4channel nonpremultiplied textures, so I had to give him the correct answer. However, that solution had some restrictions I didnt like. My next question is then Access raw 4channel data from png files in iOS p  pI think it is a bad library design not making it possible to read 4 channel png data. I dont like systems trying to be smarter than myself. p
Negative 890 pIm building a page tab app on Facebook that allows users to create and display their own entries, and I want to be able to have a share and a like button specific to each entry.p  pIm using the appdata parameter to pass the path to the page within the app, and it works perfectly with the share button  a user can share their entry to their wall, and that share links back to the appropriate page.p  pHowever, when I try to do the same thing with Likes, it instead shows the total likes for the page the page tab is a child of.

Negative 890 pI have been looking to all the other similar topics here, using UIGestureRecognizers, using hitTestwithEvent, pointInsidewithEvent etc. but nothing seems to be ok for what I need to achieve. p  pBasically I have a main view self.view of a common UIViewController and a small rectangular UIScrollView attached onto it at the bottom the scrollView is filled with some UIImageViews and the user can scroll it as usual.p  pBut the user should also be able to drag one UIImageView or a copy of it from the UIScrollView to the main view, and, this is what I am finding really difficult, with the SAME dragging gesture, hence I need a way top  p1 Distinguish between normal horizontal scrolling gesture, which should be handled by the UIScrollView the usual way and a dragging gesture over the image view.p  p2 Once identified a dragging gesture, should propagate the touch to the superview, which will host a copy of the UIImageView and WITH the SAME dragging gesture continue the dragging over the main view even out of the bounds of the UIScrollView.p  pPlease note that I know that if the UIScrollView has userInteractionEnabled  NO the touch is propagated to the subviews, but 1 I want to propagate it to the superview not the subviews, 2 the userInteractionEnabled property apparently becomes active only once the initial gesture is terminated, while I need to use a single dragging gesture.p  pThank you very much for any help.p

Negative 890 pId like to draw semitransparent primitives with GLKit. I already disabled depth testing via codeglDisableGLDEPTHTESTcode and enabled blending viap  precodeglEnableGLBLEND glBlendFuncGLSRCALPHA, GLONEMINUSSRCALPHA codepre  pNow for large alpha values e.g. 0.9, I need to draw the farthest triangles first so they dont appear emaboveem nearer triangles. This is also stated in the a hrefhttpwww.opengl.orgsdkdocsmanxhtmlglBlendFunc.xml relnofollowdocumentation for glBlendFuncap  blockquote   pTransparency is best implemented using blend function GLSRCALPHA, GLONEMINUSSRCALPHA with primitives sorted from farthest to nearest. Note that this transparency calculation does not require the presence of alpha bitplanes in the frame bufferp blockquote  pAnd in the a hrefhttpwww.opengl.orgarchivesresourcesfaqtechnicaltransparency.htm relnofollowOpenGL transparency FAQap  blockquote   pWhen using depth buffering in an application, you need to be careful about the order in which you render primitives. Fully opaque primitives need to be rendered first, followed by partially opaque primitives in backtofront order. If you dont render primitives in this order, the primitives, which would otherwise be visible through a partially opaque primitive, might lose the depth test entirely.p blockquote  pBut as the viewing angle can change when I change the render effects codemodelViewMatrixcode, the farthesttonearest order depends on the current viewing angle.p  pIs there a way to have OpenGL automatically render my primitives in the right order, and if not, what would be the best way to proceed I think that calculating the zposition of depending on the current viewing angle and ordering a few thousand triangles for each frame or, more precisely, each time the viewing angle changes, which can be each frame would be too cost intensive, especially as Id need to push this order to the GPU for each frame.p  pNote that Im not concerned with using textures just colored vertices.p

Negative 890 pI realize this question title is pretty overused, but I couldnt find an answer to my problem. This could be because either Im not too good with PHP and I dont understand the problem, or because I have a different issue, but I thought I would post it and see if somebody can help me.p  pI developed a website for a local church in my city and I made the site on my computer, put it onto my website as a sub directory and tested it all. It worked great. One of the things the client wanted was there to be an email form that can send emails. I made it and all was good.p  pI then uploaded it onto the church server and thought it went good too. But then we decided to try the email form out, and for some reason it didnt work. p  pI made the email form by having the user select a recipient pastor, office manager, etc. with a radio button, and that would change the action of the email form. I just did something like thisp  precodeif recipent  pastor      document.forms[0].action  ..scriptsphppastorcontact.php  else if recipent  pastoralAssist      document.forms[0].action  ..scriptsphppastoralassistcontact.php      else if recipent  famMinistry      document.forms[0].action  ..scriptsphpsacraassistcontact.php     else if recipent  sacraAssist      document.forms[0].action  ..scriptsphpfamministrycontact.php     codepre  pI know this isnt the cleanest, but it works great. The php files then, all look very similar to this just a different emailp  precodeltphp name  POST[name] email  POST[email] phone  POST[phone] message  POST[message] formcontentFrom name n Email email n Phone Number phone n Message message recipient  emailexample.com subject  POST[subject] mailheader  subject rn mailrecipient, subject, formcontent, mailheader or dieThere seems to be an error with this form. Sorry about the inconveince. We are working to get this fixed. headerLocation ....quickylinksmessagesent.html  gt codepre  pWhat this does, briefly, is collect the information from the email form, submit it as an email and then redirect the user to a Message Sent page. This works on my server, but not theirs so I believe its something to do with their server.p  pYou can see their server information a hrefhttpholyfamilyregina.comworking.php relnofollowherea and mine a hrefhttpdejongdesign.caworking.php relnofollowherea.p  pWhen the user sends the message, they get emThere seems to be an error with this form. Sorry about the inconveince. We are working to get this fixed.em and the email doesnt go through, although the code is the same on my server and it works fine there.p  pMy initial thought was that PHP wasnt installed on their server rare, but it does happen. But it was. So then I thought maybe it was installed, but the mail function was disabled. So I tried the following php codep  precodeltphp  if functionexistsmail       echo mail is available   else       echo mail has been disabled  gt codepre  pAnd it came back with mail is available.p  pSo now Im stuck and I dont know the problem could be.  As I said, Im not very good at PHP yet so if somebody could give a detailed answer, I would be really really thankfulp  pThank you so muchp

Negative 890 pFirst of all, I found similar questions in SO but there is not any answer for them. So, the first part of the question is a little bit duplicated. I want to improve search results in Magento. Here is what Ive done alreadyp  pstrong1.strong Search with codeANDcode instead of codeORcode when there are multiple words. p  pstrong2.strong Ajax search starts searching from anywhere and not only from the beginning of the fields. p  pstrong3.strong Trim the last codescode from the words to prevent empty results when searching with plurals.p  pstrong4.strong I changed the search type from codeLikecode to codeFulltextcode or codeCombinecode but the results were not better and even were worst, so I leave it as is. Its codeLikecode now, so there is no coderelevancecode ordering. p  pThe last thing which I want to try is a hrefhttpwww.rocketweb.comblogimprovingmagentosearch relnofollowadding this to the search queryap  precodeSELECT ... other nonfulltextcols MATCH producttitle AGAINST lean body for her AS rel1, MATCH content AGAINST lean body for her AS rel2 FROM table WHERE MATCH producttitle,content AGAINST lean body for her ORDER BY rel11.5rel2 codepre  pHere is my query but Im not sure if it would work because I cant test it p  precodethisgtproductCollectiongtaddAttributeToSelect     array     rel1 gt new ZendDbExprMATCH name AGAINST .queryText.,     rel2 gt new ZendDbExprMATCH shortdescription AGAINST .queryText.        thisgtproductCollectiongtgetSelect     gtwhereMATCH name,shortdescription AGAINST .queryText.     gtorderrel11.5rel2 codepre  pThe main idea is to add bonus weight to a result if the search query is found in the title of the product. The problem is that I dont know where to modify the query. I cant find where it is at all. codethisgtproductCollectioncode is not the right object, I know it. I looked at all the codeCollection.phpcode files, resource models, models and even the query log but no luck. There are just little 1 or 2 row parts in some files but not a full query. Im new to Magento and still have problems with finding this type of stuff. So, where I have to place my additional stuff when I have to extend a query p  pCommunity Edition Magento, version 1.6.1.0.p  pNote I know that some extension for improving search results will work much better than my solutions but for now I have to do it in that way. It would be a good experience for me, too. p  pstrongEditstrongp  pSo, I figured out how to add my custom fields for the ordering but itsbr untruly I think. In codeclass MageCatalogSearchModelLayer extends MageCatalogModelLayercodes codeprepareProductCollectioncode method I added two joins to the query and get the fields coderel1code and coderel2codep  precodecollectiongtgetSelectgtjoinLeft     arraycpev gt catalogproductentityvarchar,     cpev.entityid  e.entityid AND cpev.attributeid  96,     arrayrel1 gt new ZendDbExpr2.01LENGTHcpev.value  LENGTHREPLACELCASEcpev.value, LCASE.queryText.,   LENGTH.queryText.   collectiongtgetSelectgtjoinLeft     arraycpet gt catalogproductentitytext,     cpet.entityid  e.entityid AND cpet.attributeid  506,     arrayrel2 gt new ZendDbExprLENGTHcpet.value  LENGTHREPLACELCASEcpet.value, LCASE.queryText.,   LENGTH.queryText.  codepre  pI have these fields now but as you can see I have hard coded stuff like codeattributeid  96code etc. which is not good at all and it will not work everytime  I checked these ids directly from the database tables. I wrote it like this because I havent access to codenamecode and codeshortdescriptioncode fields but they are in the result. Dont know why. So, codecpev.valuecode is codenamecode field and codecpet.valuecode is the codeshortdescriptioncode field. Moreover I cant order the results by these fields. I tried codecollectiongtaddOrderSUMrel1rel2code, codecollectiongtgetSelectgtordernew ZendDbExprSUMrel1rel2. DESCcode, some codeaddAttributeToFiltercode stuff etc. but its not working. p  pstrongEdit 2strong  I accepted emjamesem answer but finally we bought an extension for improving the search results. p

Negative 890 pSo here is the problem. Im working on a combatsimulator for an AI based game. The AI should calculate the best move for him when the enemy makes his best move against every move.p  pMy team has X units with 5 possible moves and my opponent has Y units with 5 possible moves. X and Y  0 using alphabeta pruning we want to generate each possible outcome and take the best one out in the end. The problem is the fact that we save each outcome into a situation, this situation stores lists but the lists contain references to the objects stored, this makes them save their moves into the same situation all 5 moves of 1 unitp  pImagine 2 of our units and one of theirs. We create a situation and add one unit with 1 of the 5 directions to it. Then for our second unit we add one direction, then for the enemy unit. Now we got the end situation we want to save this. Then from the situation we had in OUR second unit so without the enemy unit we want to add a different move for the enemy to the situation and save that new situation if it was better. But since C uses references for lists this situation is the situation with the other enemy move included aswell.p  pCode is a bit large but Im really stuck here so Id hope if anyone has some spare time to help me out with ideas to fix this.p  precode    public Situation RecursiveMaxTreeListltSimAntgt undone, int index, bool[,] positions, Situation situation              SimAnt front  undone[index]         int max  situation.Max         ListltSimAntgt bestmoves  new ListltSimAntgt          int frontY  front.position.Y         int frontX  front.position.X          if front.isEnemy ampamp undone[index  1].isEnemycutoff activated                      foreach Direction direction in directions                              int newX  GameState.WrapHorizonalfrontX  direction.toVector.X                 int newY  GameState.WrapVerticalfrontY  direction.toVector.Y                 if positions[newX, newY] ampamp map.isNotWaternewX, newY                                      add the updated ant to the new allAnts list                     positions[newX, newY]  true                     ListltSimAntgt newallAnts  situation.GetList                     Friend newant  new FriendnewX, newY                     newant.direction  direction                     newallAnts.Addnewant                      Situation current  RecursiveMinTreeundone, index  1, positions, new SituationnewallAnts, maxgeeft min van alle enemy options                     positions[newX, newY]  false                     if current.Max gt max                                              max  current.Max                         bestmoves  current.GetList                                                                     else max                      foreach Direction direction in directions                              int newX  GameState.WrapHorizonalfrontX  direction.toVector.X                 int newY  GameState.WrapVerticalfrontY  direction.toVector.Y                 if positions[newX, newY] ampamp map.isNotWaternewX, newY                                      add the updated ant to the new allAnts list                     positions[newX, newY]  true                     ListltSimAntgt newallAnts  situation.GetList.Clone                     Friend newant  new FriendnewX, newY                     newant.direction  direction                     newallAnts.Addnewant                      Situation current  RecursiveMaxTreeundone, index  1, positions, new SituationnewallAnts, maxgeeft min van alle enemy options                     positions[newX, newY]  false                     if current.Max gt max                                              max  current.Max                         bestmoves  current.GetList                                                                     return new Situationbestmoves, max           Situation RecursiveMinTreeListltSimAntgt undone, int index, bool[,] positions, Situation situation              SimAnt front  undone[index]         int max  situation.Max          int frontY  front.position.Y         int frontX  front.position.X          int currentmin  100          foreach Direction direction in directions                      int newX  GameState.WrapHorizonalfrontX  direction.toVector.X             int newY  GameState.WrapVerticalfrontY  direction.toVector.Y             if positions[newX, newY] ampamp map.isNotWaternewX, newY                              add the updated ant to the new allAnts list                                     ListltSimAntgt newallAnts  situation.GetList                 Foe newant  new FoenewX, newY                 newallAnts.Addnewant                 if index gt undone.Count  1                                      return new Situationsituation.GetList, CalculateBattleValuesituation.GetList                                  else                                      positions[newX, newY]  true                     Situation current  RecursiveMinTreeundone, index  1, positions, new SituationnewallAnts, maxgeeft min van alle enemy options                     positions[newX, newY]  false                     if current.Max lt max                         return current                     else if current.Max lt currentmin                                              currentmin  current.Max                                                                     return new Situationsituation.GetList, currentmin       class Situation      public SituationListltSimAntgt ants, int max              this.max  max         this.ants  ants          ListltSimAntgt ants     int max      public ListltSimAntgt GetList      get  return ants        public int Max      get  return max    codepre  pKind regards, mep

Negative 890 pId like to upload an audio file to my website, programmatically create an video slideshow using an image already on the server, and then upload that video to YouTube using its API. The website is built on Grails, so a Java solution would be great Linux command line could also work.p  pUploading videos using the YouTube API is working well. I also have no trouble getting avconv or ffmpeg to create videos that will play in, for example, Windows Media Player. This works to make a playable moviep  pavconv i image.jpg i audio.mp3 video.mpgp  pHowever, manually uploading that video to YouTube results in a format error. I can create other files that YouTube will process successfully, but the audio plays back with regular stutters. A second or so of clear audio, then a brief gap, then some clear audio, ...

Negative 890 pI am having some trouble when clearing my filtering functionality on my table.  As it stands, I can filter by an item or by a rating.  I can also filter by a rating and then an item, or vice versa.  The trouble comes when you click the table headers to clear the filters.  I only want it to clear the filters on the associated column.p  pExample  I click Cookie then I click Good. At this point I should only see good cookies .  Next, if I click rating, I want it to clear the Good filter and just show me Cookie.

However, to arrange these images Ive used padding left to line them up correctly, dynamically changing how the padding is calculated so that everything turns out evenly.  However when I do this, the padding covers up some of the images to the left, and even though you can see the images behind this padding, when you click on that image, it will evaluate the image whos padding is being used the furthest left element.  Im basically wondering if there is a way to programatically set something that does what padding does to images but isnt clickable  Margins would make sense, but you cannot set margins on ImageViews.p  pThe tree set up is like thisp  precodeA BCD EFG codepre  pImagine every letter is an ImageView, dynamically placed with padding.  But if I click on B or C, Ds code will be evaluated because its left padding covers B and C.  The same goes for E or F, click those, and G will be evaluated.  I cannot figure out a different way to place these ImageViews.  Any help is greatly appreciated.p

Negative 890 pIm having a strange problem using an codeActionViewcode in my codeActionbarcode specifically codeActionbarSherlockcode.  This issue is only happening in devices below SDK 3.0 basically Gingerbread devices is all Im testing on.p  pMy app has a codeViewPagercode and I am animating one of my menu items while an codeAsyncTaskcode is running.  If I touch the codeActionViewcode before swiping everything is ok, if I swipe to any of the views, then go back to the first view, which is the only view to have the codeActionViewcode, and touch the codeActionViewcode the icon is doubling up on itself, like sop  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comnZFRJ.png altenter image description herep  pI had this same issue previously, before I implemented a codeViewPagercode, and I fixed it by stopping and starting the animation in codeonCreateOptionsMenucode and calling codeinvalidateMenuOptionscode, which is why I have codeActivityCompat.invalidateOptionsMenuthiscode in codeonResumecode of the codeActivitycode.  I was hoping, by calling that, the menu would refresh itself and fix the duplicating, but it isnt.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong Using codegetSherlock.dispatchInvalidateOptionsMenucode seems to, at least, get the menu to refresh itself, but it causing the codeActionViewcode to go nuts.p  pstrongViewPagerstrongp  precodepublic class Main extends SherlockFragmentActivity      private static ListltIntegergt

Negative 890 pId tested my app on a Nexus 10 Android 4.2.1, and the overflow menu on the action bar worked fine.  So I was dumbfounded when the overflow menu didnt appear on a Galaxy note 2.  After reading a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9739498androidactionbarnotshowingoverflowAndroid action bar not showing overflowa and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12871850howtocontroluseofoverflowmenuinicsHow To Control use of OverFlow Menu in ICSa, I eventually realised that on the Galaxy note 2 theres a built in menu button, and the overflow menu comes up if one presses that button.p  pThe responses to those two questions suggest that one should not use the code there to disable to permanent menu button, because although it has the effect of a making the overflow menu appear in the action bar, apparently it also b forces the same behavior in other apps too.  However, for me the overflow menu in the action bar is far superior to the menu button, and comments left on those two questions suggest that some other people think so too.p  pMy question is, what is it possible to use that code to disable the permanent menu button in onResume, and reenable it in onPause  How reliable a method would that be to make  the action bar overflow menu work in my chosen app, with all other apps left unchangedp  pJust for the record, it seems to me that the Android designers both software and hardware have somehow conspired to create this problem, and theres no easy solution.  Some programmers think that having all apps work in the same way on a single device is more important than having any particular app work the same way across different devices.  Other programmers think the opposite.p

Negative 890 pI have a MySQL table with names in it. I am trying to get a random list of names in random order from the table, without a big hit to performance. I found a query that does this and have implemented it, but with one flaw... Say I have 10 names in the database and I request 2 random names using the query. I usually get 2 back, but sometimes I only get one. This of course gets worse if I ask for say 9 names back. Ill get 5, then the next time 8, then 9, then 2. I believe that this has something to do with the script selecting a random id and then going up from there, the issue is that I want to have exactly the number of names back that I request each and every time Unless the database doesnt contain enough names, in which case it returns all of the names, but in a random order.p  pHere is the query I am usingp  precodeSELECT Name  FROM RandomNames AS r1  JOIN      SELECT Rand  SELECT MAXID FROM RandomNames AS ID  AS r2  WHERE r1.ID gt r2.ID  ORDER BY r1.ID AS C  LIMIT  codepre
Negative 890 pI have a standard periodogram produced from the spectrum function call in the R stats package with frequency vs spectral density. The spectral analysis relates to long monthly ocean water level time series data that are composed of many signals and noise.p  pI wish to determine the amplitude of the sinusoidal signal corresponding to peaks in the spectral density at frequencies of 0.071 14 month cycle and 0.0094 8.85 year cycle. How do i convert the ordinate of the spectral density into signal amplitude Is there a relatively quick conversion p  pIs there a recommended function callpackage in R to extract the estimate of the real sinusoidal signal corresponding to a known frequency from the periodogramp  pMany thanks Philp

Negative 890 pI have a graph that displays the preview of a capture card AVerMedia HD DVR PCI to a window that is connected to a ps3 via components. I would like to know if there is a simple way of detecting when the resolution of the source changes. p  pFor example, for ps3, the menu is displayed at 1920X1080 1080i and when you enter a game, the game changes to 1280X720 720p. I would like to set the resolution using IAMStreamConfig and AMMEDIATYPE but I need to know when to switch the resolution. If it were to stay at 1080i, the image would be 14 of the entire rectangle showing a bad experience. p  pWould a solution be creating a filter and reading the bytes of the image to detect if there is data therep  pThanks in advance.p

I have in fact killed off the cmd line process to see if it has any effect, and it doesnt. p  pAny help would be appreciated. p  pIn case it wasnt clear, the question is How do I kill off the PYTHONSCRIPT or any other processp  pEDIT Im sorry I wasnt clear... Im using PYTHONSCRIPT as a filler. I am starting many different processes this way, not all of which are python scripts. Some are batch files, some are python scripts, some are perl scripts, etc. I would much prefer a generalized solution here.p  pEDIT 2 The situation is a little more complex than it might appear from the question. For instance, I am using scons to build some code. Using cmd C scons is easy. However, starting the scons process is much more difficult, because it is a python script. I pass in a different working directory, so python.exe scons.py scons wont work at all, and neither will scons.bat scons since scons.bat needs to find scons.py, and scons.py isnt in my working directory. p

So excuse me to ask a question that has been treated already, but i need more basic explanations p  pI am working for several weeks on C ASP.NET and pattern MVC.p  pI would like to know ,once view is returned by the controller, if its possible to scan the view in order to change some strings.p  pIn fact, i would like to translate all the strings of a partialview from a method that would scan the whole partialview and change the strings into other specified strings.p  pFor a basic example , lets say i have a simple partial view like this p  precode public ActionResult ListeUsers                       return Viewnew ModelOfUser           codepre  pAnd the view returned by this controller p  precode     ViewBag.Title  USERLIST    codepre  pAnd i have an RESX file where USERLIST is linked to List of usersp  pI would like to place the method that would check the view and translate any string into his related language string.p  pIn this example , the string USERLIST will be changed into List of users and displays like that on screen.p  pBut i dont know how the controller will scan the view to get the string USERLIST , you seep  pI ve understood that purpose of MVC is to separate Model Views and COntrollers. Therefore Models and Controllers dont even know what Views look like p  pHow can i scan the View from Controller or Model  p  pI dont want to change manually the strings by calling a method in the view each time i want to translate a string.p  pThanks in advance for answersp

Negative 890 pI am trying to tune the auto scroll distance of the default IOS behaviour. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.combkzi4.png altenter image description herep  pAs shown in the picture, by default, the screen will scroll automatically up so that the key board wont hide the section you are editing. But the problem with this is that it only scrolls up high enough so that the top of the key board overlapping on the bottom of the cell.p  pWhat I want is something like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com6Izqk.png altenter image description herep  pSo instead of just moving up till the keyboard wont cover the textField, it should move up some extra space so that the next textField could be seen as well.p  pOk, now I finish the description. Here is what I have tried. 1. I have tried to delegate the didSelectRowAtIndexPath to roll up the table view. 2. I have tried to use a tap gesture recognizer to handle the tapPosition and then scroll.p  pThese two methods actually works to some extent but they are still not 100 what I want. Because once I tap focus on text field the table view still not moved high enough so that I can see the next field. It seems to me that the textFields focus on event has higher priority than the tap gesture and cell selectionp  pNow this is what I want, I was wondering if there is a way to tune the default scroll up behaviour on focus of the text field. p  pThanks.p

Negative 890 pWere using Red Hat Linux 6.4, and our application is built using Qt. The application has multiple windows and we support a layout system where our users can save the application layout and restore it later. The application is crossplatform, and on Windows, everything is fine. On Linux, were having problems restoring windows when a window spans multiple monitors. Our configuration uses a single virtual X display spanning all monitors, and the users can manually position and size windows across the monitors as desired.p  pWhat weve found is that the window manager is enforcing a policy on windows that are programmatically set and forcing them not to span across divide between two monitors. When we attempt to restore a saved layout containing a window that spanned monitors, the window manager reduces its size and repositions at as it sees fit. Basically, as long as the user makes the change by dragging and resizing the window, the window manager respects it, but an application that programmatically sets it gets overridden. Im sure someone somewhere thought this was a reasonable restriction, but our customers disagree.p  pA developer here has spent days searching and experimented trying to find a way to work around this behavior programmatically, or better yet, tell the window manager to stop doing that. Were using the GNOME desktop and Qt 4.8.x.p  pAny ideasp  pThank you, Doug McGrathp

Negative 890 pSo I am writing a program on linux terminal and my program has two parts. The first part is division, the second part is calculating the MOD for some numbers. The way to quit the first part is to put 999 in either of the inputs to divide. p  pMy problem is that the user must put a second number even if the user input 999 as a first input. I was wondering if these is a thing like in windows where you can do goto someOtherLocation in linux. This is the codep  precodeecho Enter the number to divide dividend enter 999 to quit read numberOne [IF NUMBERONE  999, JUMP TO SECONDPART] echo Enter the number to divide divisor enter 999 to quit read numberTwo  while [ numberOne ne 999 ] ampamp [ numberTwo ne 999 ] do     while [ numberTwo eq 0 ]     do     echo You cannot divide by 0, please enter another number     read numberTwo     done  RESULTecho numberOnenumberTwo  bc l echo numberOne  numberTwo  RESULT echo numberOne  numberTwo  RESULT gtgt results.txt echo Enter the number to divide dividend enter 999 to quit read numberOne echo Enter the number to divide divisor enter 999 to quit read numberTwo done  SECONDPART  counter1 totalCount0 temporal0  while [ counter lt 101 ] do temporal expr counter  5 echo counter MOD 5  temporal echo counter MOD 5  temporal gtgt results.txt totalCountecho totalCounttemporal  bc l counterecho counter1  bc l done  averageecho totalCount100  bc l echo The average of all the MODs is average gtgt results.txt codepre  pSo as seen above, I would like to jump from the input straight to the secondpart, if the input is 999.p

I tried update to previous revision and back, but the situation has not changed.p  pAnyone knows why this happensp  pBen Yes, I know it. But you dont understand my problem. For example, one guy commit a file image.jpg. I updated my working copy of project to new revision. But this file is not added to solution, and there is an error when building the solution for example that there is file image.jpg not found. But I can manually add this file to solution because it is in my project folder it downloaded after upgrading to latest revision. You understand mep  pstrongUPD.strongp  pOK. Thanks to all who are trying to help me. Maybe Im not very clear explains, so try again in more detail.p  pI have a server PC with VisualSVNserver and repository. I have TortoiseSVN and VisualSVN plugin for Visual Studio on my PC.p  pWe worked on the project Im not one, and successfully commit changes and checkout.

I see it in repository through the web server interface, and I see it using Windows Explorer on my PC, in the folder with local working copy of project, but I dont see it when I open solution in VS I can use in Solution Explorer AddExisting item and add this files, but I think its wrong.p  pSo I tried update to previous revision and back I thought it could solve my problem, but this does not work.p  pYes, maybe this because some files were not added to the repository strongINSIDEstrong of VS, but how I can fix project now I have broken project. p  blockquote   pIf I do a clean checkout with TortoiseSVN without VisualStudio, do I see the filep blockquote  pWhat you mean without VisualStudio I always use VisualSVN plugin for this.

Negative 890 pIm developing a large project using the Ada language around 10000 lines of onlycode. During the use of the contractbase programming Ada2012 features like pre, post conditions, type invariants etc. I find that when an Assertion or a condition goes wrong, the program terminates, hence the assertion has been checked, but without any messsage about the type and the place where the error is.p  pThen, to figure out if the problem was about the ada 2012 features, or instead, about any runtime error, I tried to insert a simple runtime error that doesnt concern with AssertionsContracts a division by zero.p  precodedeclare     X  Integer  1  1     Y  Integer  1  X begin     null end codepre  pand in this case the compiler advises me that will be raised an exception but at runtime the program completely terminates but anything is printed out. Hence the problem comes out with all kind of runtime check failure, not only those that concern with Assertions.p  pMoreover I tried to make a new project with only few lines of code to try a simple runtime error as before division by zero and also preconditions and Assertion failure. In this small project the program print on the consolle all the errors. Only the large project is affected by the problem.p  pMy question is where could be the problem Why this affects only my project and not the simple, just created, one Could be there options that inhibit the printing of runtime check failure Im running on XUbuntu 13.10. Im using the latest 2013 gpl version of gnat, gps, gnatcoll, aws, polyorb. Im compiling with switches gnata and gnat12.p  pThanks very much for the help.p

Negative 890 pIm trying to create a web application that lets users upload an .xls file that I then take and feed that uploaded.xls file into my program which reads and parses it.

Negative 890 pHere is a repo with my exact setup a hrefhttpsgithub.comIntegralistFreshInstalltreemasterShell relnofollowhttpsgithub.comIntegralistFreshInstalltreemasterShellap  pHere is the link specifically to my code.vimrccode file a hrefhttpsgithub.comIntegralistFreshInstallblobmasterShell.vimrc relnofollowhttpsgithub.comIntegralistFreshInstallblobmasterShell.vimrcap  pHere is the link specifically to my custom code.vimcode files a hrefhttpsgithub.comIntegralistFreshInstalltreemasterShellvim relnofollowhttpsgithub.comIntegralistFreshInstalltreemasterShellvimap  hr  pIm trying to automatically source some custom code.vimcode files.p  pFor automation to work I realised I needed my custom code.vimcode files to be in a specific order and so I had to prefix the file names with a numerical number. For example, code1.settings.vimcodep  pI tried putting them inside of code.vimplugincode but when I open Vim none of my plugins are running so I have to manually execute codeBundleInstallcode or before starting Vim run codevim BundleInstallcode but the moment I close Vim and start it again the plugins again are not running. So unless there is a way to get Vim to automatically execute the bundle install command and only do it once, because doing it every time I open Vim is just ridiculous.p  pSo instead, I decided to try and automatically source them myself via Vim Script.p  pThe following script works...p  precodeset runtimepathDROPBOXFresh InstallShellvim runtime 1.settings.vim runtime 2.vundle.vim runtime 3.mapping.vim runtime 4.commands.vim codepre  p...but isnt scalable because every time I add a new code.vimcode file then Ill have to update the script.p  pSo I tried another way...p  pNote my code.zshrccode exports the variable codeDROPBOXcode and sets it to my Dropbox path.p  pIf I open up Vim in a new tab so Im in my codecode directory and execute codeecho DROPBOXcode I see codeUsersmarkmcdonnellDropboxcode.p  pIf I open up Vim in a new tab so Im in my codecode directory and execute codeecho isdirectoryDROPBOXcode I get back code0code which means Vim cannot locate that directory.p  pBut if I open up Vim in a new tab so Im in my codecode directory and execute codeecho isdirectoryUsersmarkmcdonnellDropboxcode which is the same as what codeecho DROPBOXcode returned with the addition of an extra forward slash at the end I get back a code1code which means Vim emCANem locate that directory.p  pSo there is something not quite right with how Vim Script interprets a manually typed path and one that is expanded from an environment variable.p  pAn example script I tried was...p  precodeif isdirectoryDROPBOXFresh InstallShellvim   for file in splitglobpathDROPBOXFresh InstallShellvim, .vim, n     execute source  file   endfor endif codepre  p...but the files werent being sourced and thats when I realised that within Vim the line codeisdirectoryDROPBOXFresh InstallShellvimcode was returning code0code.p  pI cant manually enter the full path because I sync my files across different machines and so the path changes.p  pSo instead I modified the if statement to codeisdirectoryexpandph.vimcode which returns code1code when run within Vim this is when I codecdcode into the Dropbox folder codeFresh Installcode and open the codeShell.vimrccode file.p  pSo, codeecho expandphcode returns codeUsersmarkmcdonnellDropboxFresh InstallShellcode hence it has managed to locate the correct directory.p  pBut again this did not work.p  pI also tried another format but essentially the same process just more concisely written code   execute joinmapsplitglobDROPBOXFresh InstallShellvim.vim, n, source  . vval, n codep  pAgain did not work.p  pI then tried...p  precodefor file in splitglobpathDROPBOXFresh InstallShellvim, .vim, n   execute source  . file endfor codepre  p...but without checking the folder existed because it should always exist. p  pBut now I get the error codeOnly one file name allowed source UsersmarkmcdonnellDropboxFresh InstallShellvim1.settings.vimcodep  pSo it looks like its almost working but maybe the space in the path is causing the script to think there are two arguments when its really just one.p  pI went back to the previous non concise version and tried to quote the commandp  pcodeexecute source  . filecode and codeexecute source  . filecode and also codeexecute source filecodep  pBut again, none of these worked.p  pIm sure Im missing something really simple, but any help appreciated.p  h2UPDATEh2  precodelet files  splitglobDROPBOXFresh InstallShellvim.vim, n let mapped  mapfiles, source  . vval execute joinmapped, n codepre  pThis is the same command as before but expanded a little bit.p  pI think I need to be able to get a set of double quotes around the codevvalcode so that when the command is codeexecutecoded then the space in the file name wont cause an issue.p

Negative 890 pI know this has been asked, probably, a million times, but for the life of me I cannot get anything to work. p  pI have a UI wizard control that on the changed event validates the model. If the model is not valid, it doe not allow the user to move forward in the wizard.

Negative 890 pIve been looking high and low for an answer to what I thought was a fairly simple question Why are access declarations deprecatedp  precodeclass A  public     int testInt   class B public A  private    AtestInt  codepre  pI understand that it can be fixed by simply plopping using in front of codeAtestIntcode, but without some sort of understanding as to why I must do so, that feels like a cheap fix. p  pWorse yet, it muddies my understanding of using declarationsdirectives, and the scope resolution operator. If I must use a using declaration here, why am I able to use the SRO and only the SRO elsewhere A trivial example is codestdcoutcode. Why not use using codestdcoutcode I used to think that using and the SRO were more or less interchangeable give or take some handy functionality provided with the using keyword, of which I am aware, at least in the case of namespaces.p  pIve seen the following in the standardp  blockquote   pThe access of a member of a base class can be changed in the derived class by mentioning its qualifiedid in the derived class declaration. Such mention is called an access declaration. The effect of an access declaration qualifiedid is defined to be equivalent to the declaration using qualifiedid [Footnote Access declarations are deprecated member usingdeclarations 7.3.3 provide a better means of doing the same things. In earlier versions of the C language, access declarations were more limited they were generalized and made equivalent to usingdeclarations  end footnote]p blockquote  pHowever, that really does nothing other than confirm what I already know. If you ireallyi boiled it down, I am sure my problem stems from the fact that I think using and the SRO are interchangeable, but I havent seen anything that would suggest otherwise.p  pThanks in advance P.S. I know this probably isnt the place for it, but if theres anything about SO etiquette that I should know, please point me in the right direction.  As of this moment, my plan is simply to mash any available positive button if someone provides a good response given that such a button exists.

Negative 890 pI have a script that uses ajax to send mail. I have tested it by checking the email that will receive the mail and true enough, the ajax request is successful. I also checked the console window of my Firefox browser and it also shows me a successful message. But my problem here is that instead of the codedonecode callback function, the codeerrorcode callback function is fired. You may all wonder why Im still using the codeerrorcode function instead of codefailcode. The reason for this is because when I tried using the codefailcode function, it doesnt trigger the alertbox that I have set inside it. So what I did is go back and use codeerrorcode function again since at least it triggers the alertbox I made.p  pHere is the scriptp  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt     var submitButton  submit               Variable to cache button element     var alertBox1  .success                  Variable to cache meter element     var alertBox2  .alert     var closeButton1  .close1                   Variable to cache close button element     var closeButton2  .close2                   Variable to cache close button element       function          contactform .submit functione             e.preventDefault             console.log hello              var formData   this .serialize             console.log formData               .ajax                  type POST,                  url send.php,                  data formData,                  dataType json,                  done function                          submitButton.fadeOut500  Fades out submit button when its clicked                         setTimeoutfunction   Delays the next effect                              alertBox1.fadeIn500  Fades in success alert                         , 500                  ,                  error function                     submitButton.fadeOut500  Fades out submit button when its clicked                         setTimeoutfunction   Delays the next effect                              alertBox2.fadeIn500  Fades in fail alert                         , 500                                                  closeButton1.clickfunction   Initiates the reset function             alertBox1.fadeOut500  Fades out success message             setTimeoutfunction   Delays the next effect                 input, textarea.notinput[typesubmit].val  Resets the input fields                 submitButton.fadeIn500  Fades back in the submit button             , 500                  return false  This stops the success alert from being removed as we just want to hide it                   closeButton2.clickfunction   Initiates the reset function             alertBox2.fadeOut500  Fades out success message             setTimeoutfunction   Delays the next effect                 input, textarea.notinput[typesubmit].val  Resets the input fields                 submitButton.fadeIn500  Fades back in the submit button             , 500                  return false  This stops the fail alert from being removed as we just want to hide it               ltscriptgt codepre  pWhat seems to be the one causing this Just to reiterate, Ive tried using codefailcode instead of codeerrorcode callback function since that is one of the answers I found in the Internet and also because I know for a fact that the codeerrorcode function is already deprecated.

Negative 890 pIm building a php jsonp rpc server and currently i am stuck with not finding sufficient information on how to handlerespond if a jsonp call throws an error inside the called functionmethod.

Negative 890 pIm creating an addin for Microsoft Excel that helps to automate some of my accounting processes.  One of the pieces of the addin is a ribbon tab with a button.  Clicking this button opens a form with a list box that displays each account worksheet name and their respective balances.p  pThe problem is that the rest of the controls in Excel are still tangible while the form is open.  If, for example, a person were to change the name of the worksheet while the form was open, it may cause an error.p  pI noticed that message boxes render an application unclickable until they exit the screen. It isnt limited to just message boxes, either Ive seen the Nexus Mod Manager do the same thing when installing mods for games.

Negative 890 pI am moving from ASMX web services across to WCF. With ASMX, for security purposes I passed a password as a parameter to my web methods. Id like to introduce a better layer of security going forward. Theoretically an attacker could decompile my application that consumes the web service, extract the password and consume the web service maliciously. Can I make it in some way so that the web service can only be consumed by my client application and not by any other means including a decompiled version of its executable Does WCF introduce any any superior security methods I notice that the client object that consumes the web services has properties for credentials. What exactly are these properties and how are they implementedp

Negative 890 pI am trying to learn junit testing in eclipse and i have tried to start off with something simple. I wrote a basic program with 2 methods, an add and subtract method which both take 2 arguments. So I tried testing the add function only, with a test that looked like thisp  precodeimport static org.junit.Assert. import org.junit.Test  public class addtest       Test     public void testAdd          class1 calc  new class1         int expected  7         int actual  class1.add3, 4         assertEqualsadding 3 and 4 , expected, actual         expected  15         actual  class1.add5, 10         assertEqualsadding 5 and 10 , expected, actual       codepre  pand it was working as i wanted. p  pBut then when i tried to implement the second test for subtraction, i noticed that it never seemed to test that section. I even tried having a second test method in case my subtraction method was incorrect. This is what i have for my latest test.p  precodeimport static org.junit.Assert. import org.junit.Test  public class addtest       Test     public void testAdd          class1 calc  new class1         int expected  7         int actual  class1.add3, 4         assertEqualsadding 3 and 4 , expected, actual         expected  15         actual  class1.add5, 10         assertEqualsadding 5 and 10 , expected, actual           public void testMinus          class1 calc  new class1         int expected  0         int actual  class1.add12, 4         assertEqualssubtracting 4 from 12, expected, actual        codepre  pI noticed that the test testMinus never does anything, whether the assert is true of not. Is there something wrong with my implementation I have tried running the source folder as a junit test already, nothing was fixed.p  pThanks a lot for any helpp  pEDIT I tried commenting out the first test, so that my test function has only testMinus inside it, and now it is testing the second method.

He wants to keep these updates into the local db and at the end of the day, do a batch update to external source.p  pWhich makes sense for now. But if the website has to be accessed over mobile in the future  seems like soon... having a local dbsql processing will be an issue when accessing via mobilep  pemYes the application is layered and have few different interfaces for services, access and connections.emp

And then I used my cell as codeCustomTableViewCell cell  [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifierCellIdentifier forIndexPathindexPath]code. This didnt work. The tableView remained blank.

Negative 890 pI am looking to collect data snapshot on a random interval from various machines in our network that we dont own, but may get access to install an agent to collect these data. p  pThese machines are either in a domain or workgroup and kind of data i get are based on the role they play and information they have. The machines are Windows Server 2003 and above and I do not want to install anything on those machines before i get started, so thought I can use the PowerShell scripts that I can remote invoke form my server and pass the script it has to run to return the data. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comCxOhm.png altenter image description herep  pI was wondering if this is possible to do that with the PowerShell scripts and as this is supposed to run in a secure environment, is there any major security implications with this approach. i.e. do I need to do anything on the client machines that can make them vulnerable to security threats. p  pBTW these machines are not exposed to internet and are behind a firewall.p  pI would appreciate if you point me to any other alternatives that can be useful for my analysis.p  pRegards Kiranp

Now my question is Is it a good idea to have multiple collections created from the original collection and to use these collection for the transaction from UI. These small collections are kept updated on daily basis using CRON.  p

Negative 890 pProbably the most straightforward definition of the list reversal function in a functional language is using Haskelllike pseudocodep  precoderev []  [] rev xxs  rev xs  [x] codepre  pHowever, every beginning functional programmer is taught that this implementation is inefficient and that one should instead writep  precoderev [] acc  acc rev xxs acc  rev xs xacc rev l  rev l [] codepre  pA bad thing about the efficient version is that the programmer is forced to introduce an auxiliary function and parameter whose meaning is not very clear.  It occurred to me that it might be possible to avoid this if a language permitted implicit definitions roughly like the followingp  precoderev []  [] rev xxs  m  rev xs  xm codepre  pThese equations fully determine the behavior of coderevcode, so they might be said to constitute an implicit definition of it.  They do not have the defect of introducing the auxiliary function coderevcode.  Yet there is a natural way of evaluating the function that will be efficient.  For instance, here is a plausible reduction sequencep  precoderev [1,2,3] matches second line with x1, xs[2,3], m[] reduces to rev [2,3]  [1] matches second line with x2, xs[3], m[1] reduces to rev [3]  [2,1] matches second line with x3, xs[], m[2,1] reduces to rev []  [3,2,1] reduces ultimately to [3,2,1] codepre  pI dont have much of a sense for how widely this kind of thing could be applied, but it does seem to work nicely in this example at least, and it seems to me that it could at least work for some similar cases where one would otherwise have to introduce auxiliary functions for the sake of efficiency.  Can anyone point me to any papers that discuss something like this or languages that support something like this  It sort of feels like a logic programming thing to me, but I have very little experience with logic programming.p

Negative 890 pI am making a computer system which I have broken down into several smaller parts.p  pFrom a given experience, it is crucial in software development to keep systems small.p  pIn order to do that I am implementing a module which serves a specific purpose, all and by itself without having any idea what the rest of the system is doing. idealp  pSo this module goes there and does its thing, and when an event occurs in an instance of this module, I want the index file to become aware of that happening. I do not want this module to communicate directly to the other modules, as they should not communicate with each other, thereby decreasing dependencies within the system.p  pNow, I have made the instance and the instance does everything right, but when an event occurs in this instance, how do I get that information over to the index filep  pAn event of this instance is implemented in the following manner thediv.addEventListenermousedown,this.reacttomousedownfunctionp  pAnd here its  a question how its best to get this happening to the index file, I can do in the index file thediv.addEventListenerclick, thefunctionp  pbut that forces the index file to be aware of things going on in the instance because the instance has children which each has event detector and their numbers can grow and schrink and god knows what. it would be best if the index file wouldnt need to understand how the instance of the module works. and thereby not needing to be generating new event listeners on the fly as the instance is living.p  pHow is it best to setup the interaction between the index file and this instancep
Negative 890 pWe use Domino 8.5.3 environment. We want to forward an email  message to another email address.

Negative 890 pId like to randomly generate an encryption key and password for an SQL Server CE database when its created, and then save the key in some secure way that would allow the program to open a connection, but not be easily reachable by potential attackers.p  pIm working on an offline WPF application that stores certain user and setting information in a local database.p  pMy current implementation is to have one Device Password that the user sets up which is used as the encryption key for the generated SQL Server CE database password. The base64 encrypted database password is then saved in a simple .txt settings file. When the application starts up, the user enters the Device Password and that string is used as the decryption key for the saved password. If the resulting string is able to open a connection to the database, the password was correct and the program is opened with full access.p  pWhat Im trying to do now is modify the system to allow multiple users with specific UsernamePassword credentials to open the program and access the database with varying levels of privilege. The way that Im trying to achieve this is by handling the user authentication separately, and opening the database regardless of the credentials to load some basic application info.p  pBelow is roughly my current implementationp  precode        var candidateDBPwd  DecryptDatabasePasswordpasswordBox.Password, Settings.Instance.EncryptedDatabasePassword          if candidateDBPwd.IsNullOrEmpty                       Users password didnt decrypt database password.             return false                   if File.ExistsConstants.DBFILE                       Normal operation Try to open the database file to see that               weve got the correct password.             string databaseArguments  Constants.DBARGSSECURE  candidateDBPwd             using var conn  new SqlCeConnectiondatabaseArguments                              try                                      conn.Open                                  catch System.Data.SqlServerCe.SqlCeException ex                                       Failed to open the database Users password must have been wrong                     return false                               codepre  pIve spent the past few hours researching similar issues and am now beginning to wonder if its possible. Consensus seems to state that storing passwords or connectionStrings in the App.config file is futile because if you encrypt the sections, you still need to store that key somewhere in code. Most of the existing SO threads on the issue seem to be several years out of date and it seems that that practice has deprecated. Is there some new respectable way to store a local database password Or would you recommend a different approach to implementing the featurep

Negative 890 pI am developing an Android Home Screen, I seem to be experiencing problems. Whenever I start an application from that home screen, its lifecycle ends up to being destroyedI Knew this because I used LogCat and it does print my code in the OnDestroyed method. I only want it to only be paused not completely destroyed because I am running a little long processes in the oncreate. I only wanted the onCreate to be called once, which is when the device boots. In my case, since whenever my home screen starts an application, it is destroyed. And whenever I press the HOME button, it goes through from on create  on start  on resume.

Negative 890 pFor a while I was stumped my centered background images were not pixelperfect aligned in their containers. I even got different results within the same browser but different windowsp  pFinally I found out what is happening, but Im still short of a robust crossbrowser solution.p  pThe case Im working on a collapsable treeview in javascript. Everything is functioning alright, but in some cases the collapseexpand buttons are off one pixel to the left. p  pThe images for these buttons are userdefinable, as well as the size width of the container they appear in. The images are drawn in the center of these containers with codebackgroundposition center centercode. Now there are cases the image cant be fit emexactlyem in the center of the container for example, centering a 9px image in a 20px container, theres a 1pixel difference on either side. This should be no problem, as long as we have consistent behaviour on how the browser handles this.p  pBut heres where it gets messy Ive implemented this treeview inside a wrapper centered with codemargin0 autocode based on the browsers viewport. And here is when I get different results when both the viewport centering and background centering dont fit exactly within the pixel boundaries.p  pThis is probably hard to follow, so Ive squeezed the problem into a fiddle a hrefhttpjsfiddle.net3y65wgu81 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.net3y65wgu81ap  pCSSp  precodewrapper1      width400px  inner1   perfect center      margin0 auto     width200px      height50px  wrapper2      width399px  inner2   1pxoffcenter      margin0 auto     width200px      height50px  container   image 1pxoffcenter 9px centered in 12px container      width12px      height12px     backgroundurldataimagegifbase64,R0lGODlhCQAJALMAANLNves58a7rd7Vznuatff39wAAALXD1vfz7fj3tbTxsa6pdbPxt7b0sa2pSH5BAAAAAAALAAAAAAJAAkAAAQoEJFJiSw4l6mxmUYYJgp4nKczJUngKsOkOMOyNMAECALDPAJLhYKIAAA7 norepeat center center 444  codepre  pHTMLp  precodeltdiv idwrapper1gt     ltdiv idinner1gt         ltdiv idcontainergtltdivgt     ltdivgt ltdivgt ltdiv idwrapper2gt     ltdiv idinner2gt         ltdiv idcontainergtltdivgt     ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pTwo different wrappers centering their content, containing two identical containers having a small button drawn as background. Chrome seems to be the only browser that draws the buttons in alignment consistently, but firefox and IE show the problem I described. Try resizing your browser window, and see the buttons bounce from one side to the other.p  pMy question is how can I get at least identical results, without losing flexibility on buttoncontainerwrapper sizing and styling.p  pstrongEDITstrong Heres a picture that illustrates my usecasep  pa hrefhttpwww.honeypot.nldevcenteringexample.jpg relnofollowExampleap  pThe area marked in blue is the container that holds the collapse button. This area is always square, but may vary in size. The button can be any image smaller than this container and is placed directly on top where the lines meet. No stretching or scaling should occur on the image. In this example the button is too far to the left. Resizing my browser window makes the image jump in and out of correct alignment, as the fiddle above describes.p

Negative 890 pI am implementing an application with two panels containing a GLcanvas each one of them.

For example a texture change in an object in both of the scenes. I cannot setCurrent a hidden panel and the glMethods used are going to be applied just in the visible scene. p  pAm I forced to set visible the other panel to make the modifications and then come back What is the best approach to handle multiple panels with multiple contexts not always visible all at oncep  p The two scenes have more than a different camera placement, that is why I use different contexts.

Negative 890 pI need to render a 2D image in which the axises are latitude  representing the Xaxis and longitude  for Yaxis. Assuming the viewpoint is always at the origin0,0,0 then a 3D line segment in Cartesian coordinate is a 2D curve segment in this image. Here each point along the curve represents  and  angles. Having a 3D line segment from P1 to P2, and knowing the equation of the corresponding 2D curve segment,  f, the curve can be drawn from 1 to 2. Three lines make a triangle. Therefore a triangle is drawn as three curve segments which makes a closed shape. p  pThe problem is that this shape is drawn like in wireframe mode and the enclosed area is not filled. I cant think of any way to somehow fill in the area. Is it possible to achieve this I appreciate any help and like to discuses it with other.

Negative 890 pIve tried lots of different methods of horizontally centering my website, but every single method either breaks the page or offsets it slightly. Ill try and elaborate as much as possible.p  pI have a website containing a Bootstrap grid of HTML5 videos. You can preview the site here a hrefhttpwww.watchthis.limited relnofollowwww.watchthis.limiteda I want the entire grid to be positioned horizontally to display an equal sized black bar above and below the content. Im currently using a wrapper with a paddingtop of 10, but this isnt a good solution because the content isnt directly in the middle on all browsers.p  pIm pretty sure the main problem is that there is no fixed height because I want the content to stretch to the browser size so each image is 100 width, heightauto. When I tried to absolutely position the page the content just fixes to the top of the page. This is the code that I tried to apply to the wrapper before resorting to paddingtopp  precodewidth 100 height 100 position absolute top0 bottom 0 left 0 right 0 margin auto codepre  pIve also tried setting the content as a table and setting the child to verticalalign middle, but that still offsets the content in the middle for some reason. So, any ideas How do you vertically align a grid of images which have no fixed height or width  is it even possible Any help will be more than appreciated,p  pThanks.p  pNote I know that the page breaks when its viewed on smaller devices, Im currently in the process of changing the website for mobile devices.p

Negative 890 pWe have a large lineofbusiness application based on Filemaker Pro 13. It consists of 50 binary files ranging from 10MB to 5GB. I would like to use Git to manage versioning of this system.

In my case, many of these files have small changes or restructurings that could be in any of the 50 files for any changeset or node.p  pIs Git currently a good tool for managing a relatively fixed set of mutable binary files Do I need an extension If so, which If not Git, what to usep

Negative 890 pFirst off Im pretty new to dll programming. So Im programming an UI dll which should help me in my projects. The problem is that Im getting errors, that dont really say much and Im a little bit confused. So Ive a class called UIContainer witch was supposed to be my base class from which all othersButtons and so on derive. And because I save them in a List of pointers for the type UIContainer Ive to use virtual methodes. But when putting the virtual statement before my methodes it gave me errors so I researched an found out, that Ive to declare them as pure virtual methodes so I created the UIElement class which simply is a Interface for the UIContainer to be able to use virtual methodes and dont have to reimplement them in every class that derives from UIContainer. But now I get these error and cant really explain why. Has anyone an idea   p  precodeError 42    error LNK2001 Unresloved external symbol declspecdllimport const Buttonvftable imp7Button6B.

Negative 890 pWe are very close to production with our app, but are having some really strange and annoying performance issues when using the PopupWindow in Android.

to turn off hardware accelleration on the popup container layout and also on the scrollview but it doesnt seem to be doing any difference Do I need to specifically turn off hardware accelleration on

Also, when openeing and closing the popupwindow we run an animation  and this runs smooth as silk, so the jerky behavious is only visible when scrolling in the popupwindow. Also, I have other popupwindow which is coded in the same architecture, and those also struggle with jerky motion.p  pBR Michaelp
Negative 890 pI have a list of blocks and some of them are visible only when you scroll down. I need to have the ones not visible scaling in size from 0 to 100 once they come in viewport, kind of a lazy load effect but on the entire element instead of the image only. To do that, I add a class to the waypoint element. Waypoints adds the class also on the elements that are already in the viewport when the page load. Is it possible to target only the elements that arent already in viewportp  pThis is the function Im usingp  precode.post.waypointfunctiondirection      if direction  down this.addClassanimate ,  offset 101  codepre  pAnd this is the example link a hrefhttpbrainfood.clientapproval.co.uk relnofollowhttpbrainfood.clientapproval.co.ukap  pIf you scroll down, youll see that the class is added to the elements already in viewport.

I know from the example above that reinterpretcast assigns to the int pointer the address of keyStr[29] In assembly that would translate intop  precodelea eax, [keyStr1D] mov [reCast], eax codepre  pSo in other words reinterpretcast, in a low level prospective, is not dangerous at all as it does not modify the original data.p  pI wanted to know how the other casting methods behave in a low level way. So, for example, an object, in a low level way, is just a variable which holds an address. And the type if that object is how the compiler then interprets that address and how it offsets it. this is exactly what Im not interested in, in assembly, i could care less if that variable holds a value, a pointer or an object  i.e. another pointer  . Another thing that could be just the same, is the difference between int and int or unsigned int and int all 4 declarations generate the same assembly instruction.  push value  or sub esplength of int ampamp mov esp, value I hope this clarifies the question and why I tagged it lowlevelcode and assemblyp  pP.S. In this program Im trying to create I dont care for non portability or other high level stuff. Im trying to be as low level as possible and as close to assembly language as possible. That means that, for this program, memory is just memory  i.e. 0 and 1 bits  and types are not important  e.g. I dont care if mem address 0x123 is an int type or float type, its just datap

Negative 890 pI am currently trying to write a shader in unity that draws a triangular pattern around countries in a riskstyled game if both countries are not owned by the same player visual aid to see your borders.p  pRight now, Im having an issue with making the shader set the countries properly.p  pIt always sets country 0 to the left, and country 1 to the right  country 0 and 1 are set programically.p  pThe line, a border, can be between 0 and 359 degrees.p  pHow I find the countries 0 and 1 is I draw 3 points to the left and right of the midpoint of the line, one .01f, one .1f and one 1f away from the midpoints in each direction, then spin them around the midpoint to the appropriate location.p  pAfter that I do an evenodd check to see if the points are inside or outside of each country, and compare the weight results closest gets 3 points, mid gets 2, furthest gets 1, just in case someone builds a really screwed up country that flanks the other country.p  pIn my test map, a close to equally sliced octagon, the borders showed up correctly after I reversed the positions of country 0 and 1 in the event the angle was over 90 and less then or equal 180. Worked without a flaw, but in other maps it doesnt work very well.p  pEverything but the country allocation works well, so Im curious if anyone knows of a better way to figure out which point is to the left or a spun line, or a better conceptual way to handle this.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comHNAAR.png altenter image description herep  pThat above is basically when Im doing, red being left right being blue, then Im just checking 3 different spots then weighing in the lefts and rights found with evenodding it into the appropriate countries one at  .01, the other at  .1 and the third 1, in case of evenodd rounding issues with closeness.p  pI then flip them if I find that country A is to the right, as it is on the left according to the angles I had draw. my shader renders left first and right second, hence why I do this.p

Negative 890 pHey guys so I am wondering if this is possible. So in my game I have it set up to where if they make a point the score goes up by 5. I implemented a multiplier in the game so if they dont get hit and continue making points then the score could increase by 10,15, and 20 depending on if they get hit or not of course. p  pI have my Difficulty updater using a modulus to track every score interval of 100 then increase the difficulty. The strongPROBLEMstrong I am having is if they have a multiplier at the time and instead of getting 100 they get 105 the modulus doesnt take that into consideration and the function is never called. p  pHere is how I have it set upp  precodeprivate function udpateDifficutlyModulusvoid               if nScore  100  0 ampamp nScore gt 0                       seagullNumber  0.5             eelNumber  0.5             traceUpdate Modulus difficulty             addBombs               codepre  pNow this works fine if they score is divisible by 100 but like I stated before sometimes its 105 or 115 etc...p  pI think I have to check somehow if the score is odd or even and greater than 100 I just dont know how I would go about doing that p  pAny help of course will be appreciated Thanksp

Negative 890 pI am experiencing an issue with a refactoring of our payment processing action method called by our 3rdparty online payment provider.

Negative 890 pIve been studying ASP.NET 5 for some time now and there is something Im yet confused. To implement authentication in Web API 2 what I used to do was basically use the OWIN OAuth Authentication Server Middleware. It was simple to use, I could configure just what I needed and there wasnt a bunch of stuff I needed to put on the app without need for it.p  pNow, at first I didnt find this in ASP.NET 5 and I thought it was a matter of time to wait the middleware to show up. But yesterday, reading on the issues on the Security repo I found out that apparently there is no intention to port this middleware to the new version of the framework.p  pInstead, it seems people are encouraged to use Identity Server 3. I took a look on the project and although it is nice and has many usages I really prefer to configure just the minimum I need sometimes. Also, another drawback is that Identity Server 3 needs the full CLR, so if I need to use it in order to provide authentication on my application I would need to stop using Core CLR, which for me is a emhugeem disadvantage since Core CLR is a lot more lightweight.p  pSo, if I dont want to use the Identity Server 3 on ASP.NET 5, how can I implement authentication for Web API if the OAuth Authentication Server middleware is gone Has anyone been through that and found a way to deal with itp  pHow to deal with authentication on ASP.NET 5 Web API without using Identity Server 3p

Negative 890 pNeed some help with a SSIS package Im creating. So heres what Ive done up until now.p  pI have a DTSX that has a Script Component in a Data Flow that references an assembly where I have all my logic to connect to a remote server using entity framework and retrieve some records from a table.p  pAll my unit and integration tests on that assembly work fine. Unfortunately after deploying the package to Server A and running it with a SQL Agent Job, it gives an error when executing the script component indicating that it cannot find the SQL instance Im looking for. Same result if I try to execute manually the package.p  pIve already made sure that the servers can communicate. Ive created a console app using that assembly and it works fine, Ive made ping requests to the remote server and its ok, Ive connected to that server using SQL Management Studio, Ive even added the remote server as a linked server on server A and was able to execute a query.p  pLast attempt I made was creating a SQL Agent Job that run my test console app, and the result is OK too. I did this to make sure that the user that invokes the console is the same that invokes the DTSX. p  pIm really getting out of ideas so if anyone can help I would be very grateful.p

Negative 890 pIm reading Performance Tips and Tricks in .NET Applications which is a page of documentation created by Microsoft. One of the tips mentioned in the documentation is to make chunky calls, which are function calls that perform several tasks as opposed to chatty calls which are function calls that perform simple tasks. The rationale is that chatty calls might require multiple calls, whereas you can call a chunky method once and itll do multiple things.p  pI was a bit confused on whether or not this is contradictory to the principle that Ive been learning regarding writing methods and classes that do one thing very well as opposed to many different things. Is this principle better left to UNIX modules that can be piped into one another Or should we focus on writing methods and functions that are simple, reusable, and do only one thing really well as opposed to multiple things If thats the case, then is it a defect to get better performance with chunky calls rather than chatty calls Or is the principle merely geared towards making code more readable and maintainable rather than highly performantp  pThe documentation Im referring to can be found here  a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms973839.aspx relnofollowhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms973839.aspxap  pBest regards,p  pHandleThatErrorp

Negative 890 pI have a project, that is basically making a Total Conversion from an existing game, which resides in GitHub. So I have this original game in a Branch of my repo lets call it OriginalGame, thats linked to the original games repo and that I keep in synch with it. Its made of C code in src and data in dat.p  pMost of my TC is replacing dat content with entirely different content. basically, replacing the original game universe with my own. But I sometimes need to make modifications to the C code in src. These modifications will or not be proposed to be pulled back into the original game.p  pSo heres my problem  I would want to have a branch containing ONLY src and in synch with the src in my BranchOriginalGame branch lets call it OriginalGameCSource. From this branch, I would derive a branch being MyCCode including my own modifications, and that I keep in synch with the OriginalGameCSource. And I would finally inject that branch, along with my own dat folder, into my final TC branch, being for instance MyFinalTC.p  pThe issue for me is, Im new to Git and GitHub, and I just cant figure how to create the OriginalGameCSource by getting only the src folder from OriginalGame.p  pIve already looked into the internet and found some related ideas, but none that seems to solve my issue.p  pThe closest was about git subtree split command, but it didnt preserve the directory src, it dropped all the contents of src on  instead, which was not the behavior expected. I used the following command p  precodegit subtree split prefixsrc annotatesplit 20150523  b NAEVvanillaCCode codepre

Negative 890 pIm working on a Grails 2.4.2 app, and the same code base is used for a variety of customers. Each customer gets the GSP based web UI customized with their own icons, text strings, etc. Ive made sure that the customizations are done in the GSP pages using Groovy variables defined in Config.groovy. I.e. something like thisp  precodecustomerName   favicon    if appName  foo    customerName  Foo   favicon  faviconappName.ico  codepre  pThese variables are then referenced from within the GSP pages. This works fine. The problem is that the app needs a separate war file for each customer. So the CI server builds a war for customer A, then runs grails clean, modifies the app name etc in the application.properties file, builds the war for customer B, etc. Each war file build takes about 4.5m, multiplied by 10 customer builds. So I thought that the better way would be to build the war file once, then have the CI server copy it N times, and modify the application.properties file with the customer name, servlet context path, etc. inside each of the war files. Someone pointed out to me that the GSP pages get compiled during the war file build, and that they end up with the context path as part of the class name. This seems a little odd to me. I.e. lets say I have Customer Foo, and I decided to build a war file called foo.war, which will be deployed at the servlet context path foo. The the compiled result for a page bar.gsp will be something like thisp  precodeWEBINFclassesgspfoobar.class WEBINFclassesgspfoobargsphtml.data WEBINFclassesgspfoobargsplinenumbers.data codepre  pI experimented with taking the already compiled war file for customer A, changing the app name and the context, and redeploying it as customer B. It works fine, and I see customer Bs icons, etc. So, the summary of the question I guess boils down to whether or not the emfooem part ties the page to the context path foo, or if its simply a cosmetic thing I certainly dont want the performance hit of lazy compiling or recompiling at run time. And because the content of the GSP page in this case is basically static and doesnt change, it seems like it wouldnt have to be tied to the context or app name. Does anyone know if its just a naming thing, or if Ill run into problems by not recompiling the war whenever I change the app namecontext Maybe theres a better way of accomplishing what I want Thanks. p

I have spent several days on this.p  pThe Error isp  blockquote   pAn exception of type System.NullReferenceException occurred in   AppWebm2cylvfu.dll but was not handled in user code Additional   information Object reference not set to an instance of an object.p blockquote  pstrongHTMLstrongp  precodeltdivgt     ltfieldsetgt         ltdivgt             Html.LabelForm gt m.ServerName         ltdivgt         ltdivgt             Html.DropDownListFormodel gt model.ServerName, Model.ServerNames,  Select Server          ltdivgt         ltdivgt             ltinput idbtnConnect typesubmit nameConnect valueConnect gt         ltdivgt     ltfieldsetgt ltdivgt codepre  pstrongJAVASCRIPTstrongp  precodedocument.readyfunction     btnConnect.clickfunctionevt      evt.preventDefault     evt.stopPropagation      var selectedServerName  ServerName.val     .ajax       url Url.ActionConnectToServer, Settings,       data          servername selectedServerName       ,       cache false,       type post,       datatype json,       success functionresult          var el  DatabaseName         el.empty  remove old options         el.appendltoptiongtltoptiongt.attrvalue, .textPlease Select         .eachresult, functionvalue, key            el.appendltoptiongtltoptiongt.attrvalue, value.textkey                            codepre  pstrongControllerstrongp  precodepublic PartialViewResult Index      var afConnectionModel  new AFConnectionModel          ServerNames  GetServers          return PartialViewafConnectionModel   [HttpPost] public JsonResult ConnectToServerstring servername      return Jsonnew          foo  bar, baz  Blech        private static dynamic GetServers      var piSystems  new PISystems.Selectc gt new Afart          Id  c.Name, ServerName  c.Name          return new SelectListpiSystems, Id, ServerName    public class Afart              public string Id  get set           public string ServerName  get set         codepre

Negative 890 pIve been trying to install Wordpress on IIS and everything went smoothly with a standard installation and an handler mapping for phpcgi.p  pSince I have a public server A and a private shared server B, I need to have a WP installation on server A with a shared database and shared wpcontent on server B.p  pThe main issue is configuring a Virtual Directory on IIS for wpcontent on server B with the required permissions. The Wordpress on server A is able to access the media resources images and other files. Through wpadmin, I can also access and upload new resources to the shared wpcontent.p  pThe problem starts as soon as I try to see the installed plugins or install new ones, since WP cant access the plugins folder, and, as a consequence, the website cant be viewed as well.p  pIve already tried several things in order to solve the referred problem.p  pThe steps I tried, not necessarily in this order, werep  ul lipCreated an user on both machines with the required permissions on wpcontentpli lipGave full access permissions to that user also Everyone on wpcontentpli liCreated a Virtual Directory on IIS and Connecting As the created userli liRunning the Default Web Site APP Pool with that userli ul  pAt the step Im at, the wordpress does not load the installed plugins and asks for FTP credentials while trying to install new ones.p  pIt seems to me that the problem may be with additional permissions that I dont know about.p  pIf anyone has successfully accessed a shared wpcontent with IIS, please help me before I go mad.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 890 pI am working on an IBM DB, but I think the concepts are pretty much the same.p  pI want to fetch a single line, return these data or save them into variables lets say and update some fields of that specific row. There might be a number of instance who try to perform that query in the same time, and therefore we need the operation of fetching to be atomic.p  pEach row has a field called pending, init to FALSE. When one instance fetches this row, this is set to TRUE thats the update I want to do. Reason that I need it too be atomic, is that my query fetches the first row of the table, where pending is FALSE. p  pIn pseudocode I have something like this p  precodeOPENDBmyDb, DBNAME   opening the DB BEGINTRANSACTIONmyDb   beginning transaction on my db EXECUTEQUERYmyDb,SELECT  FROM tbname WHERE pending  0 ORDER BY colid LIMIT 1 ... assign a cursor to my results while validdata       assign column fields to variable       and here i want to do the update for this column      I guess the problem is here      EXECUTEQUERYmyDb,UPDATE tbname SET pending  1 WHERE colidcolid   COMMIT codepre  pDont worry about the syntax, they are macros and once executed on its own they work. I am guessing the problem is on the second query but whyp  ul liShould I commit first and then perform the second queryli liIf yes, then how can I ensure that there will be no other instance reading the same row before I update itli ul  pI guess this doesnt have to do with the DB I am using.p  pIf I comment the second one, code works. If I execute the second one stand alone, it works as well.p

Negative 890 pi am using MVC kendo grid and I am trying to add select alldeselect check box to the header. I have javascript which does the logic of selecting amp deselecting all the individual check boxes. I also want to selectdeselect the header check box based on check boxes in the rows. Since during grid initialization grid rows are unknown, we cannot attach click event to the individual check boxes in the rows.  we have to do that after data is bound to the grid. I also wanted to maintain the state of the check boxes when user navigate through pages or do sorting.  because of this paging amp sorting is done on client side. Server operation is set to false The javascript is working correctly. Im calling this javascript in dataBound event of the grid as suggested a hrefhttpwww.telerik.comforumsselectallcheckbox relnofollowherea by telerik support.  However dataBound event is getting fired on each page change and sort. As per the documentation a hrefhttpdocs.telerik.comkendouiapijavascriptuigrideventsdataBound relnofollowherea it should get fired when widget is bound to dataSource.

Negative 890 pI have customized error pages setup on my site for the 302, 401, 403, 404 and 500 HTTP error codes. The five custom error page files are stored in the home directory.p  pI would also like to protect a specific directory with a password and have tried doing so with cPanels Password Protect Directories feature.p  pI should also mention that in the home directory, there is an code.htaccesscode file, with the followingp  precodeltlimit GET POST PUTgt order deny,allow allow from all ltlimitgt  Options Indexes  ErrorDocument 302 302.php ErrorDocument 401 401.php ErrorDocument 403 403.php ErrorDocument 404 404.php ErrorDocument 500 500.php codepre  pWith that out of the way, I can now explain whats currently happening with this setup. Essentially, rather than the web browser prompting for the username and password, the passwordprotected page simply goes straight to the code401.phpcode error page.p  pIve tried moving the error pages to their own directory, codeerrorcode, Ive tried using cPanels own error page setup tool which uses code.shtmlcode files, and Ive also tried a combination of cPanels error pages and my own.p  pFrom my testing, it seems that cPanels code.shtmlcode error pages work, but they are ugly and dont match the theme of the website. The error pages I made, use PHP to require files for the theme, as well as to echo back the users requested URL.p  pI also seemingly had the combination of both sets of error pages working, even after I reuploaded the home directorys code.htaccesscode file, but upon removing the set that cPanel made, everything broke again.

Negative 890 pIve been exploring image recognition via Neural Networks. After some research, I started with Encog and their ImageNeuralNetwork.java example.p  pIn their example, they use one image per US currency coin penny, dime, etc as a training set and then identify a given image of a coin accordingly.p  pNow I want to use their example as a starting point to practice with different images. Im trying to use shapescolors as training. For example, I want the program to recognize the difference between a red circle and red rectangle, but I also want to recognize the difference between a red circle and a blue circle.p  pI remember reading that you shouldnt overtrain and give every possible combination of training images as in giving 4 images in this case, of 2 differently colored circles and 2 differently colored rectangles.p  pWould I still be able to use Encogs coin identification example to train on multiple categories shape and color or is this another concept Is there a particular minimum number of training images I can provide without providing every possible colorshape combination and thus overtrainingp

Negative 890 pin my current project I am working with a codeJTablecode and codeDefaultTableModelcode. Everything is working so far and currently for saving the TableModel I simply serialize the object to disk.p  pAs this might be a reasonable way of saving and loading the data I dont like the fact that the data is completely obfuscated  in byte form. This makes data almost impossible to rescue if something bad happens. Another problem is the strongserialization UUIDstrong which makes it harder to update my program and dont make the data unloadable.p  pThe database will be filled over the years and will contain important information. To make data recoverable I wanted to parse the TableModel into an XML file but this fails because the XML Encoder cannot deal with the JTable  TableModel.p  pWhat are recommendations for saving data from a codeJTablecode in clear text form efficiently Is simply iterating through columns amp lines and saving this into a text file with seperators between column data line by line a good way My concerns here are that the user might use a separator like  which I might use as table data and make the parser crash.p  pThanks for your help.  p

I was searching a lot, and have found informations about codeallowoverridecode, virtual hosts I have only IP, what is server name then the IP, etc, and have tried a few different things, but I dont want to mess it completely up, and Im pretty sure it must be some very simple adjustments to make it work, but I dont know what maybe some settings with EC2 like elastic IP I dont yet have that one but Im not sure I need it. I dont have much experience, can you please point me to the right direction what else I have to set in order to make it work Thank you very muchp  pUPDATE I have set Elastic IP up and registered a domain.p
Negative 890 pA lot of information on the web tells how to set up nginx  fastcgimonoserver4 on the same machine to host ASP.net at the moment Im using F application with Websharper from linux environment.

I need to convert this codeIListltTgtcode interface to codeListltTgtcode class. I can use code.ToListcode extension method which internally creates a new instance of codeListltTgtcode by passing IEnumrable this argument to its constructor see a hrefhttpreferencesource.microsoft.comSystem.CoreSystemLinqEnumerable.cs,833 relnofollowherea. Generic codeListltTgtcode constructor just iterates through this enumberable.

So, is it an optimal way in terms of performance and readability to do this codeInnerList  items as ListltTgt  items.ToListcode If no, please provide with details about better way and why.p
