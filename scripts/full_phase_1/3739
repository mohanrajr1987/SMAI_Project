Positive 3739 pim planning on creating a system that has 2 parts, the first part will be found in the client side while the other part is in the server side. there are 2 different programs here running, the client side will save a data in the database and raise a flag or a trigger which will then be the cause for the server side part to start and retrieve data from the database and process it in an API.p  pat first i decided on using a scheduler on the server side to continuously run the program and check for any changes in the database using a status field, but then this is not that efficient as it would be wasteful to always check for changes.p  pthus i was hoping you can help me out in finding a different solution to my problem here so that i may do this more efficientlyp

Positive 3739 pI am developing webpage which will ask user to upload images.This uploaded images will be verified at server side by PHP. I am more concerned about how should verify it at client side. Many solutions given on internet talks about checking this by using file extension but this is not good idea to do. If anyone changes extension of file such as file.exe to file.jpeg then executable file will considered as jpeg. What will be the solution for this sort of scenariop
Positive 3739 pSay I have a server where anyone can upload a script that other users can interact with. During this interaction the script can create requests to the server to manipulate files CRUD. However the manipulation should strictly be limited to the path that the file initially originated from, so that other files that are served from the same domain cannot write to paths other than their own.Strangely I would not be authenticating on a per user basis, but on a per scriptfile that originated the request basis. p  pSay I somehow assigned a name to every script that lived on the server and every time it attempted to manipulate a file, its name was given, would there be anyway to validate their identityp  pTake note that they could not pass any type of confidential information such as a password since it is visible to anyone using the script.p

Positive 3739 pI have a web client  server application written on top of ordinal Web stack PrimeFaces  JSF  JavaBean  ORM  JDBC  DBMS. Now I have faced whith a need of adding a business logic to the client side. The logic will be complex, and is not be covered by JavaScript moreover it will contain  platform  dependent modules. It is also important but not restricted to keep existent web client access. So the questions are how to rewrite the application with minimum efforts Which technologies are the best for this situationp  pThe one idea is to add an embedded server e.g. Jetty to the client side it preserves all the UI, backing beans, etc. and make data synchronization between the local and remote servers. But I have no idea how to acheve this synchronization.p
Positive 3739 pI am looking for recommendations on how to design an application like SoundCloud.p  pI am planning to develop an application that will be available across multiple platforms. I want to start developing for Android because thats what I am most comfortable with. The best example I can give ye to show what I want is an application like SoundCloud.p  pI am looking for advice on how to design such an application. So far I have a Sign up with Google button on one of my activities. New users would click this button to register with their Google account information.

Positive 3739 pI am developing a 9p server, it is pretty much like an nfs server. Subsequent mounting and unmounting causes no socket descriptor file leakage because I am able to close the socket. However, in the following scenario, the server does not do a proper clean up and close the socket. The scenario is, when the client at Machine A mount a FS from the server machine. Then for some reason, Machine A restarts or is shut down. If this happens, I am expecting the server to clean up the work and close the socket but for some reason it blocks on read. I thought a read should return 0 when a connection is closed but it doesnt. I assume thats because a proper tcp termination has not occured so the server is waiting for some data from the client. Here is a pseudo code of my serverp  precodewhile1      n  readsockfd, buffer, 4 4 is protocol header that specifies the size     if  n  0  break      iteratively read the rest of bytes until the incoming message ends   cleanup  close socket and some other tasks codepre  pHowever, when the client restarts while the server is blocking on read, nothing happens. What is the best way and easiest to solve this Some people suggest running a separate thread that checks connections but this is too involved. I am sure there must be a faster wayp
Positive 3739 pI have this code in the server side that processes normal string messages sent by the  client.

Client 2 has a Toyota car and client 3 has a BMW car. The server on computer 1 wants to tell client 2 that it has a new car, an Avenger.p  pHow do I keep track and call services on the clients I thought of saving their ip address from calling ipconfig from the cmd in the DB  but isnt that based on the WIFInetwork they are connected top  pThanks for any helpp

Positive 3739 pIve stumbled over an interesting puzzle. I am programming a small family website, where Ill be showing photos with additional information. For the sake of speed and simpler programming, for editing, Ive decided to use a desktop client application so a few people will use it to edit information, and the rest of the family will just browse the site to view it. With the webpage the photos are just obtained via URL, something like codejpegfilename.jpgcode. The filename is served by PHP from a MqSQL database via AJAX. It works fine. But am I right that since it involves HTTP and the JPEG files are transferred base64encoded If so, could I make my desktop client 37  faster if I transfer images in the binary form If so, what is the good practice way to do it Thanks.p

Meanwhile, at the client side, one can start a worker to work together remotely by finding servers IP adrress. In my algorithm, each serverestablished worker is initially assigned a workerID from 1 to N.

Negative 3739 pHas anyone ever experienced a unit test that fails and when they tried to debug it to find out where the failure was occurring, the unit test succeeds when running the code in the debugger  p  pIm using Eclipse 3.5.1 with EPIC 0.6.35 and ActiveState ActivePerl 5.10.0.  I wrote module A and module B both with multiple routines.  A routine in module B calls a bunch of routines from module A.  Im adding mock objects to my module B unit test file to try to get more complete code coverage on module B where the code in module B tests to see if all the calls to module As routines fail or succeed.  So I added some mock objects to my unit test to force some of the module A routines to return failures, but I was not getting the failures as expected.  When I debugged my unit test file, the calls to the module A routine did fail as expected and my unit test succeeds.  When I run the unit test file as normal without debugging, the call to the mocked Module A routine does not fail as expected and my unit test fails.  p  pWhat could be going on here  Ill try to post a working example of my problem if I can get it to fail using a small set of simple code.p  pstrongemADDENDUMstrong  I got my code whittled down to a bare minimum set that demonstrates my problem.

Negative 3739 pIve seen several similar scenarios explained here but not my particular one. I wonder if someone could tell me which direction to go inp  pI am developing two and more later MVC2 apps. There will also be another thicker client later on WPF or Silverlight, TBD.  These all need to share the same authentication. For the MVC2 apps they preferably need to be single log on  ie if a user logs in to one MVC2 app, they should be authorised on the other, as long as the cookie hasnt timed out.p  pForms authentication is to be used.p  pAll the apps need to use common business functionality and perform db access via a common WCF Service App. It would be nice I think if the WCF is not publicly accessible ie blocked behind FW. The thicker client could use an additional service layer to access the Common WCF App.p  pWhat this should look like isp  pMVCApp1                   WCFAppCommonp  pMVCApp2                   WCFAppCommonp  pThickClient   WCFApp2   WCFAppCommonp  pIs it possible to carry out all the authenticationauthorization in the WCFAppCommon Otherwise I think Ill have to repeat all the security logic in the MVCApps and WCFApp2, whereas, to me, it seems to sit naturally in WCFAppCommon. On the otherhand, it seems if I authenticateauthorize in WCFAppCommon, I wouldnt be able to use Forms Authentication.p  pWhere Ive seen possible solutions that I havent tried yet they seem much more complex than Forms Authentication and a single DB.p  pAny help appreciated,p  pPhilp

Negative 3739 pIt seems that most new programming languages that have appeared in the last 20 years have been written in C. This makes complete sense as C can be seen as a sort of portable assembly language. But what Im curious about is whether this has constrained the design of the languages in any way. What prompted my question was thinking about how the C stack is used directly in Python for calling functions. Obviously the programming language designer can do whatever they want in whatever language they want, but it seems to me that the language you choose to write your new language in puts you in a certain mindset and gives you certain shortcuts that are difficult to ignore. Are there other characteristics of these languages that come from being written in that language good or badp

Negative 3739 pI am writing a Linux kernel module. It is released with all the source files although the license is proprietary to be compiled against the running kernel. When installing my module distributed as a code.debcode package it is compiled and installed automatically. This works.p  pThe issue is that during the regular upgrade process of the whole Linux systems, newer version of the Linux kernel are installed. When such a new version of the kernel starts to run, it does not have my module compiled for it, and my application fails. Id like my module to be compiled and installed whenever a new Linux kernel package is installed.p  pHence my question is there a mechanism in codedpkgcode that could trigger something in my package to compile and install my module when a new Linux kernel package is installedp  pSame question for coderpmcodep

Negative 3739 pI happened to ask myself a question about arrays in c. Well, we all know that arrays are fixed collections of something, I say fixed because it is necessary to declare array length when defining arrays. Well, lets consider an examplep  precodechar myarray[10]  0 int sz  sizeofmyarray  It is supposed to be 10 codepre  pWell, it is correct, 10 is the number returned by sizeof. This can be done by the compiler because he knows how much space it placed for that variable.p  pNow consider what happens in this situationp  precodevoid dosomemystruct arr     int elements  sizeofarrsizeofmystruct    for int i  0 i lt elements i         Do something hoping no overflow will ever occur      codepre  pNice... but I suppose it can be overflow prone. If I pass to this function an array I created in a normal way, everything should be finep  precodemystruct array[20] dosomearray codepre  pNo problem. But if I do thisp  precodemystruct array  mystructmalloc80sizeofmystruct dosomearray codepre  pWHAT HAPPENS I would like to understand how sizeof behaves, this function is evaluated at compile time right ok, what happens when I use not an array, but something very cumbersome like a block of data like that one furthermore, I could realloc it woth another call to malloc and ask to dosome to process that datablock again. Will it work I could try it physically, but I would get some exact answer about the behavioir of sizeof.p  pThank you.p

Negative 3739 pFor examplep  ol liLibrary symbol Card is linked to class Card which extends MovieClip.  Library symbol Card contains a card background image.li liLibrary symbol Ace is linked to class Ace, which extends class Card.  Library symbol Ace contains a TextField with a big letter A.li ol  pSo we have  Ace extends Card which extends MovieClip.  Ace therefore extends MovieClip, but does not DIRECTLY extend MovieClip.p  pWhen I drop an instance of Ace on the stage and compile the clip, all that shows up is the big letter A.  However, I expected the background image from Card to be included, since Ace extends Card, and the Card symbol contains the background.p  pIt seems like Flash ignores symbol content unless it belongs to the toplevel class being instantiated.  I think its LAME that one symbol cant extend another.  The IDE could easily draw Card as a noneditable background while Im editing Ace which extends it, and it should instantiate Cards content and then Aces content when an Ace is instantiated.  Thoughtsp

I send both bulklike newsletter and transactionallike activate account, forgot password emails. Right now, I am using a single domaintranslates to single queue on mailguns end to deliver those mails. Problem arises when I have lot of bulk emails already queued up and somebody registers or requests for a new password. I want the transactional emails to be delivered before the bulk mails, but mailgun queue works on a FIFO basis. p  pI figured a way to mitigate this can be to use different domainshence different queues which can be processed simultaneously for bulk and transactional mails. In rails smtp settings are application level settings rather than request level settings. So, I figured, I will use different environments for different smtp setting.p  pI also have a queue system for mails and am using a hrefhttpsgithub.comcollectiveideadelayedjob relnofollowdelayedjoba to handle that. I cant figure out a way to differentiate between bulk and transactional mails in delayedjob.

Negative 3739 pI am designing a database where I wish to track changes in my tables, in this case the person table, such that what appears in my Access user interface to be an edit to a person record, actually appears in my PostgreSQL backend to be a new record, with a timestamp and username field reflecting the time and person that made that edit.p  pFirst of all, Ive never attempted a design like this to begin with, so some reassurance that Im going about this sensibly would be nice.

Negative 3739 pSSMS has a query designer, which I usually avoid, because honestly, I cant really work with it.p  pUnfortunately, my colleagues do. As I have 30 minutes to spare, I finally want to know whether I am the problem or SSMS.p  pFor example  Lets assume we have a table buildings, a table floors, a table rooms and a mapping table usagetypes roomusagetypes.p  pWhen I design the query manually, i do thisp  precodeselect all buildings,  left join all floors in those buildings left join all rooms in those floors left join the roomusagetypes mapping table. codepre  pNow, when I try to do the same in query designer, it somehow starts with the mapping table, then left joins the rooms, left joins the floors, and then left joins the buildings.p  pWhich is fundamentally flawed, because if there is no entry in the mapping table for a room, it will not return all rooms this is assuming every room is necessarely in a floor, and every floor is necessarely in a building, but not every room has necessarely a usagetype associated with itselfs [for a certain period of time]...p  pNow, if I start to modify the joins I get this queryp  precodeSELECT   FROM usagetype mapping  RIGHT OUTER JOIN Floors  LEFT OUTER JOIN Rooms  RIGHT OUTER JOIN Floors codepre  pNow this query seems equivalent, but this is an example, and usually, i have to join many more tables. So I dont particularly like the mix of right and left joins, because its hard to understand in the end especially when several ON statements dont follow at the place where the join is made, making the search for bugs near impossible and I dont have much trust into query designers ability to figure out what I want.p  pI have so far not found a way to design the query like i want. The only way seems to be to create the initial query, then get the SQL text, then adjust the joins, and then reopen this with SQL query designer.p  pNeedless to say that in the end, this takes longer than doing it manually in the first place, and when the SQL script was modified by the query designer, you cant read it anymore without reformatting it first by hand...p  pIt seems to me that my variant is utterly impossible to accomplish with query designer ... What I find peculiar as well is that in the query designer, in the context menu of the join symbol, sometimes the table to the left is on top, and sometimes, the table to the right.p  pAnd then, when I have to select the lower one instead of the upper one, it does a right join. I can choose the upper one, then it does a left join, but in the wrong sequence... which is exactly what I dont want...p  pSo I wanted to ask Is there some secret way of specifying from which table the query shall start, preferably without any right joins at all   p

Negative 3739 pI learned the complexity of dequeinsert from the C standard 2003 chapter 23.2.1.3 as followsp  pIn the worst case, inserting a single element into a deque takes time linear in the minimum of the distance from the insertion point to the beginning of the deque and the distance from the insertion point to the end of the deque. p  pI always understand the implementation of stl deque as a collection of memory chunks. Hence an insertion will only affect the elements in the same memory chunk as the insertion position. My question is, what does the standard mean by linear in the minimum of the distance from the insertion point to the beginning of the deque and the distance from the insertion point to the end of the dequep  pMy understanding is because C standard does not enforce a certain implementation of deque. The complexity is just in general for the worst case. However, in the actual implementation in compilers, it is linear to the number of elements in a memory chunk, which may vary for different element sizes.p  pAnother guess might be that, since insert will invalide all iterators, deque needs to update all iterators. Therefore its linear.p

Negative 3739 pMy current project is split into multiple classes that correctly represent the way we think of the entities in the system. However, this is taking a performance price, so Im trying to come up with a way of improving performance while maintaining the current class structure we have.p  pI think an example will best illustrate the problem Lets say I have an codeOrdercode class that contains multiple codeItemcodes. A naive implementation for shipping an codeOrdercode is shipping all of its codeItemcodesp  precodeclass Order       private ListltItemgt mitems      public void Ship              foreach Item item in mitems                      item.Ship                codepre  pShipping an codeItemcode is a multistage processp  precodeclass Item      public void Ship              var receipt  mboat.ShipToDestinationthis         ProcessReceiptreceipt       codepre  pAs it turns out, shipping the codeItemcode on a codeBoatcode takes a long time. Luckily, the codeBoatcode can ship multiple codeItemcodes concurrently codeListltReceiptgt Boat.ShipToDestinationListltItemgt itemscode. However, to use this method I will have to rewrite codeOrder.Shipcode as followsp  precodeclass Order       public void Ship              var receipts  mboat.ShipToDestinationmitems         foreach Receipt receipt in receipts                      ProcessReceiptreceipt                codepre  pThis means that codeProcessReceiptcode is now part of codeOrdercode rather than codeItemcode, and also that an codeItemcode no longer takes care of all of its shipping logistics.p  pIn my real code there are many methods with this problem, so using this solution effectively means that most of the codeItemcode logic will move into the codeOrdercode class. However, this seems like the wrong place to have this logic  it really should be in codeItemcode.p  pI considered using multiple threads e.g. using a codeTaskcode per codeItemcode but this seems too wasteful, especially since an codeOrdercode can have dozens of codeItemscode.p  pAnother approach I considered is creating a codeQueuedBoatcode with a codeQueueForShippingItem itemcode method and a codeShipQueuedItemscode method. Now codeOrdercode can call codeShipQueuedItemscode while codeItemcode can call codeQueueForShippingcode. The problem with this approach is that in my real code, the codeReceiptcode is returned only after the codeItemcode was shipped, so the code would have to look like thisp  precodeclass Order       private ListltItemgt mitems      public void Ship              foreach Item item in mitems                      item.Ship                   mqueuedBoat.ShipQueuedItems          foreach Item item in mitems                      item.FinalizeShipping                  class Item      public void Ship              mqueuedBoat.QueueForShippingthis           public void FinalizeShipping              ProcessReceiptmqueuedBoat.GetReceiptForItemthis       codepre  pThis feels like its in the right direction since codeOrdercode knows how many codeItemcodes it has, it must be the component that knows when everything is on the codeBoatcode, but it broke codeShipcode into two stages. In my real code I have multiple stages each can be vectorized separately, so the method would be broken into 34 pieces, which is not a pretty sight.p  pCan someone suggest a way of vectorizing codeItem.Shipcode while keeping the business logic inside the codeItemcode class, or will I have to give up on the OrderItem separation in order to take advantage of vectorizationp  pstrongEditstrongp  pAnother approach could be thisp  precodeclass Order       private ListltItemgt mitems      public void Ship              for int i  0 i lt mitems.Count i                      bool isLast  i  mitems.Count  1             item.ShipisLast                 class Item      public void Shipbool isLast              mqueuedBoat.QueueForShippingthis, FinalizeShipping         if isLast mqueuedBoat.ShipQueuedItems           private void FinalizeShippingReceipt receipt              ProcessReceiptreceipt       codepre  pWhere the codeQueuedBoatcode class invokes a callback for each item with its codeReceiptcode.p

Users of that application also want an easy access provided by that DLL. I need a solution for making it possible.p  pAs we have corporate controlled environment we have .NET Framework, Silverlight, the toolbar and executable installed on users machines and all web applications run in IE.p  pSo far I was able to call the existing exe that I mentioned in 2 and pass the parameters from my asp.net application as ActiveX similar to what described here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions916925howtolaunchanexefromwebpageaspnetHow to launch an EXE from Web page asp.neta. It works but every time it gives that standard popup An ActiveX control on this page might be unsafe.... p  pI also tried to create my own dll that wraps the 3rd party dll and embed it in my asp.net page using codeltobjectgtcode html tag. It works too but also displays the same popup every time.p  pHere are my choices in preference orderp  ol liEmbed the UI provided by the 3rd party dll possible wrapped in another dll in existing page of my asp.net application currently it opens a new window.li liCall executable with parameters as I do it now but without annoying popup about ActiveX security.li liEmbed dll using codeltobjectgtcode tag as a rich client side custom control.li ol  pEither way I dont want users to see the popup every time they go to the 3rd party application.p  pIs there any way to do itp

Negative 3739 pIt was already a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions519520differencebetweenstaticclassandsingletonpatternaskeda whats the difference between singleton and static class. However, knowing the difference, I still feel confused every time I need to chose. p  pSo for myself I defined two different cases  Im using singletones mainly for POJO classesin java if there should be only one instance of this classwhich is very rarely and static classes for all service classeswhich occur very often. p  pFor example, in my application I need to store messagesI have a serializable class Message, write them into a file, read from a file and access during the runtime. I dont see any reason to use singleton here, static class is just okay. The only static class is MessageStorage which has 3 functions  read, write and getMessages and also one static private arraylist of messages. p  pIs this approach reasonable and if not, whats its problemp

Negative 3739 pI have a completely noninteractive python program that takes some commandline options and input files and produces output files.

Negative 3739 pThe final stage of my project is to connect my website to a bank payment gateway to allow people to buy things using credit cards but without storing any credit card data on my site. Ive been on Google and stackoverflow and think Im on the right track but am obviously doing something wrong.p  pThe idea is that as the form opens an httppost happens which sends a set of parameters to the gateway which responds with a nice long encryption string which I use to submit the actual order.

Negative 3739 pBackgroundp  pPreviously, my company was using a userdefined function to html encode some data in a where clause of a stored procedure. Example belowp  precodeDECLARE LName HTML encoded last name as input parameter from user  SELECT     FROM SELECT LName           FROM SomeView xtra          WHERE  LName ltgt                 AND dbo.EncodingFunctiondbo.DecodingFunctionxtra.LName  LName             OR Lname codepre  pI simplified this for clarity sake.p  pThe problem is, when the stored procedure with this query was called 45 times in quick succession, the average performance on a table with 62,000 records was about 85 seconds. When I removed the UDF, the performance improved to just over 1 second to run the sproc 45 times.p  pSo, we consulted and decided on a solution that included a computed column in the table accessed by the view, codeSomeViewcode. The computed column was written into the table definition like thisp  precode[LNameComputedColumn] AS dbo.EncodingFunctiondbo.DecodingFunction[LName] codepre  pI then ran a process that updated the table and automatically populated that computed column for all 62,000 records. Then I changed the stored procedure query to the followingp  precodeDECLARE LName HTML encoded last name as input parameter from user  SELECT  FROM       SELECT LNameComputedColumn       FROM SomeView xtra       WHERE   LName ltgt  AND xtra.LNameComputedColumnLName OR Lname codepre  pWhen I ran that stored procedure, the average run time for 45 executions increased to about 90 seconds. My change actually made the problem worsep  pWhat am I doing wrong Is there a way to improve the performancep  pAs a side note, we are currently using SQL Server 2000 and are planning to upgrade to 2008 R2 very soon, but all code must work in SQL Server 2000.p
Negative 3739 pI want to write a SQL query like the following. Its syntax is not correct.

Negative 3739 pIm trying to do something like thisp  precodevoid someMethodTypeA object  ...   void someMethodTypeB object  ...   object getObject      if ... return new TypeA     else return new TypeB   object obj  getObject obj.GetType obj   wont compile someMethodobj codepre  pObviously Im confused here.  I know I could make this work by just writing out a conditional statement  p  precodeif obj.GetType  typeofTypeA obj  TypeAobj else if obj.GetType  typeofTypeB obj  TypeBobj codepre  p but isnt there some way to do this at runtimep  pstrongEDITstrong I agree it seems like perhaps not the best design choice, so heres the context.  The point of the above code is Repository base class for Mongo DB.  I want it to be able to handle different kinds of tables.  So, someMethod is actually emremoveem and TypeA and TypeB are emObjectIDem and emGuidem the code at the bottom is part of a typeagnostic emremoveem method that accepts the ID as a string and getObject is a method to parse the ID parameter.p

Negative 3739 pIs there a way to limit the length of the line matched by ack If ack matches, for example, a minified javascript file, the line it prints out can be very large.

Not seeing anything conclusive in a hrefhttpbetterthangrep.comdocumentation relnofollowthe ack docsa.p  pI tried digging into it with something likep  precodeack pattern  awk print substr0,1,200  codepre  pbut codeawkcode seems to be stripping coloring and formatting, which is undesired. Also I tried bear with me for a secondp  precodeack pattern  ack pattern codepre  pTo see if I could reack on each line and chop it up or something, but that has the same formatting problem. Piping ack output removes the line breaks apparentlyp  pEdited based on commentp  pMaybe it will help to explain the main reason why I want this. I use ack.vim to search in my project. I often want to ack through my javascript files to find a word, like cookie. We have jQuery and other minified libraries versioned in our code, so they show up in the ack results. Since those files are minified, there are very few line breaks, and it shows a gigantic line in the split window which I have to scroll past. I almost never care about that match so its annoying to take up so much space. I could just add those minified file names to my ackrc to ignore but Id prefer not to have to add a new file name every time we add a minified library. There is a hrefhttpsgithub.commileszsack.vimissues30 relnofollowan open issuea on the ack.vim repo about this. I want to know if its possible to do purely through bashfu.p

Negative 3739 pMy goal is to have global constants in a C game Im working on to represent some graphics info and the like. My current implementation is to toss them all in a .h and include them everywhere. This works, except that every time I change a setting, the entire code base must be recompiled.p  pSo, my next idea was to toss them in some configuration txt file and parse them in, that way no code is actually changed when settings change. The parser was simple enough, and I could put the values into the constants, but because the parser was a code block, the constants were no longer global.p  pIs there a good way to solve this Perhaps some way to make them global despite being in a block or some way to avoid recompiling everything when changing settingsp

Negative 3739 pIm developing a Python command line utility that potentially involves rather large queries against a set of files.

The closer I can get to that though, the better.p  pstrongCandidatesstrongp  ul lipSQLite in memoryp  pSQLite on its own doesnt seem fast enough for my use case, since its backed by disk and therefore will have to read from the file on every execution.  Perhaps this isnt as bad as it seems, but it seems necessary to persistently store the database in memory.

Its not clear to me what happens to the mmap if all processes exit however.  Its ok if the mmap is eventually flushed from memory, but Id want it to stick around for a little bit 30 seconds  a few minutes so a user can run commands one after another, and the cache can be reused.  a hrefhttpblog.schmichael.com20110515sharingpythondatabetweenprocessesusingmmap relnofollowThis examplea seems to imply that there needs to be an open mmap handle, but I havent found any exact description of when memory mapped files get dropped from memory and need to be reloaded from disk.p  pI think I could implement this, if mmap objects do stick around after exit, but it feels very low level, and I imagine someones already got a more elegant solution implemented.  Id hate to start building this only to realize Ive been rebuilding SQLite.  On the other hand, it feels like it would be very fast, and I could make optimizations given my specific use case.pli lipShare Python objects between processes using Processingp  pThe Processing package indicates a hrefhttppypi.python.orgpypiprocessing relnofollowObjects can be shared between processes using ... shared memorya.

Negative 3739 pClasses are often tested by using tests written in the following sort of syntax, which is provided by a large set of testing frameworks e.g. Rubys UnitTest or as in this example, MiniTestp    pre classlangrb prettyprintoverridecodeclass TestLolcat lt MiniTestUnitTestCase   def setup     lolcat  Lolcat.new   end      def testthatlolcatcanhavecheezburger     assertequal true, lolcat.icanhascheezburger   end end codepre  por instead by using tests written in a second sort of syntax, which is provided by an overlapping set of testing frameworks  e.g. RSpec or as in this example, MiniTest againp  pre classlangrb prettyprintoverridecodedescribe Lolcat do   before do     lolcat  Lolcat.new   end   it must be able to have cheezburger do     lolcat.icanhascheezburger.mustequal true   end end codepre  pemThere are probably other syntax families which are also suitable for testing class methods and attributes, but these are the two Im interested in.emp  pWhat I want to know is strongwhat is the correct name for each of these two syntax familiesstrongp  pIf you want to know more about emwhyem Im asking, see below the line.p  hr  pThe reason Im asking this question is that searching the Web has not yielded an obvious consensus. For instance, the a hrefhttpdocs.seattlerb.orgminitest relnofollowMiniTest documentationa refers to the emfirstem syntax above as emunit testem syntax and the emsecondem as emspecem syntax. By contrast, Michael Hartl a hrefhttpruby.railstutorial.orgbookrubyonrailstutorialsec3afirsttests relnofollowdescribes class method and attribute tests written in the emsecondem sort of syntax as emunit testsema. Where tests written in this syntax test higherlevel functionality that results from the interaction of multiple classes, he calls them emintegration testsem.p  pIve also seen people describe the first and second sorts of syntax as a hrefhttpwww.rubyinside.comaminitestspectutorialelegantspecstyletestingthatcomeswithruby5354.html relnofollowemTestUnit styleem and emRSPecesqueem, respectivelya, or emTDDem syntax and emBDDem syntax. Other names for the emsecondem sort of syntax include ema hrefhttptestspec.rubyforge.orgtestspec relnofollowshouldlike syntaxaem and ema hrefhttpwww.ultrasaurus.comsarahblog201104onchoosingrspecasatestframework relnofollowstrongitstrong syntaxaem.p  pMy understanding which vaguely suggests Hartl is correct is as followsp  ul liemTDDem is a empracticeem, not a testing syntax. Specifically, its the practice of typically writing a failing test e.g. a unit test or an integration test, then code to make the test pass, then refactoring if appropriate, and then restarting the cycle.li lia hrefhttpdannorth.netintroducingbdd relnofollowemBDDema is also a empracticeem, but it does make some limited prescriptions about testing syntax. Specifically, its the practice of following TDD but using should as the first word in test names, and nesting testing code to provide context if appropriate.li liemUnit testingem is a empracticeem, not a testing syntax. Specifically the practice of testing individual units of code e.g. class methods or attributesli liemUnit testsem are emtestsem written in the course of unit testing, regardless of syntax employed.li liemIntegration testingem is a empracticeem, not a testing syntax. Specifically the practice of testing higherlevel functionality that results from the interaction of multiple classes.li ul  pHowever, this still doesnt entirely clear things up. Evidently, Im no expert in the nomenclature of testing practices, test types or test syntaxes. The best names Ive been able to come up with for the two types of syntax Ive given examples of above are, emassert syntaxem and emit ... do syntaxem, respectively. Unless these names are in widespread use, I need your advice, fellow StackOverflow usersp

Negative 3739 pWhen using vim for programming any unique words in filebuffer is quite likely to be a typoof ether variable name, method name or a language construct. Thus it would be quite a nice way to catch such typos with the ability to highlight any unique words in file, without any fancy language analysis or parsing or the need to even know what programming language is being used. Of course it would be best for that to happen as you type so that you could see your typos immediately. Somehow I dont thing Im the first one to come up with such an idea, so maybe someone has such setup or has any suggestionsp

Negative 3739 pI have a UIButton that has an initial value that I have set in interface builder. When pressing this button, I show a modal view controller which, after some user interaction, passes a value back to the first controller. I then update the buttons text with this value that was passed back.p  pAll this works fine, however, if I press this button again, as the modal view controller is animating on screen, the button which I pressed has the original text that it had when the view first loaded. Does anyone know why this is and how to make it retain the new text that I set on itp  pThanks in advance.p

I simply sayp  precodewhilerows gt 0      echo FORM INPUTS HERE     rows  rows  1  codepre  pSo the loop goes through a prints a set of inputs for record 1, and then takes one off the count, then prints a set of inputs for record 2, and so on.p  pIs there a way I can get the while loop to print more without refreshing the page The simplest way would be to have a small form at the top of the page, with an extra columns field, and submit button. This would then post the value back to the same page, and add it to the default number of rows.p  pI would like to do this without having to submit, post or GET anything, but to have it happen then and there.p  pI think it may be tricky, as the while loop will have already run, and I dont know how to get it to run a second time.p  pCheersp  pEdsp

Negative 3739 pI have an application based on Squeryl. I define my models as case classes, mostly since I find convenient to have copy methods.p  pI have two models that are strictly related. The fields are the same, many operations are in common, and they are to be stored in the same DB table. strongButstrong there is some behaviour that only makes sense in one of the two cases, or that makes sense in both cases but is different.p  pUntil now I only have used a single case class, with a flag that distinguishes the type of the model, and all methods that differ based on the type of the model start with an if. This is annoying and not quite type safe.p  pWhat I would like to do is factor the common behaviour and fields in an ancestor case class and have the two actual models inherit from it. But, as far as I understand, inheriting from case classes is frowned upon in Scala, and is even prohibited if the subclass is itself a case class not my case.p  blockquote   pWhat are the problems and pitfalls I should be aware in inheriting from a case class Does it make sense in my case to do sop blockquote

Negative 3739 pI have an iframe with a differing domain, I have no trouble resizing the iframe by communicating with the parent or the child using jQuery postMessage plugin. However, I have a single page app that scrolls through some steps and then loads in a results page via ajax. On this results page there are product links that need to load in the parent window. This works fine too. My problem is when the user clicks the back button, I want to regenerate and show the results, not the initial state of the page. On Chrome, this works fine but on Firefox it doesnt when its in an iframe, otherwise the url directly worked. It seems that Firefox ignores the hashes, cookies, pushState, etc that Ive set. Im not sure how to fix this, and any help would be appreciated. p  pFirst, I wanted to see if history api was available, when I call app.getResults I check if its available, otherwise set location.hash  results. app.resultPageSetupcurrentState loads nicely the way Id prefer because it skips the ajax call used to get the object, since I already saved it in the state.p  precodevar isHistory  function   return window.history ampamp history.pushState  This if is for a different part of the app. Just ignore. if .notcontainer2.length    setTimeoutfunction      app.setFrameHeight2500   , 1000  else    if  isHistory  true        var currentState  history.state     history.pushState, , steps     if currentState  null         .container.hide       .container2.show       app.resultPageSetupcurrentState       app.resultPageComplete      else        .container.show       .container2.hide       setTimeoutfunction          if .container.length           app.setFrameHeight610          else if .notcontainer2.length            app.setFrameHeight2500                , 1000         else      Firefox ignores this stuff.

Negative 3739 pI used a hrefhttpsubgit.com relnofollowsubgita to transform an old svn repository to git including full history, branches, tags. After some initial trouble I got it working and it worked almost perfectly. Except branches doesnt seem to be merged back to the trunkmaster branchp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comvFjSp.png altenter image description herep  pAs you can see, git knows that I branched the green master to get the black branch. But it doesnt seem to know that this branch was merged back to the master at commit code73653d1code. It just looks like I abandoned that branch and independently implemented all that in one single commit in the master branch.p  pThis isnt how a correct merge is supposed to look like, right Is there a way to fix this Note that this is about 50 commits back in history and besides the seemingly missing reference, the code is fine.p

Negative 3739 pIm encountering the following problem. I implemented a navigation with tabs and viewpager to swipe through my fragments. This is working fine so far. But the fragments are all loading data via Async Task and for that they are showing an progress dialog. Which is self is also working as it should. My problem is, that because of the Viewpager not only the actual fragment is loaded but also the one next to it. So I see wrong progress dialog. Is there any way, to achieve a behavior that the progress dialog stays visible for its fragment so, that the user is informed, when he moves to the next tab before the async task finished loading but not anywhere elsep  pHope its clear, what I wanted to say. Thanks for your help.p  pBest wishesp

Here is the code created automatically in settings.designer.csp  precode        [globalSystem.Configuration.UserScopedSettingAttribute]         [globalSystem.Diagnostics.DebuggerNonUserCodeAttribute]         public globalticktime.ProfileStorage ProfileStorage              get                  return globalticktime.ProfileStoragethis[ProfileStorage]                          set                  this[ProfileStorage]  value                       codepre  pThe problem is that I cant save this setting I used following code to check that.p  precodeif null  Properties.Settings.Default.ProfileStorage        Properties.Settings.Default.ProfileStorage  new ProfileStorage                UserProfiles  new ObservableCollectionltUserProfilegt                        new UserProfileName  1,             new UserProfileName  2                       Properties.Settings.Default.Save     codepre  pProfileStorage is always Null.p  pSo here is my problem.

Negative 3739 pi worked all day yesterday trying to back out the impacts of an incorrect connection string in my XML config file. i went through each package, deleting the faulty connection manager and readding it with the correct server name. each time i did this i explicitly updated the configuration by removing it, then readding it with the overwrite option.  but then i made the horrible mistake of pulling up the parent package, which used a different xml config, which updated the connection manager  again to the wrong server name . p  pi pulled the configurations out the parent package and started fixing the child packages again. having fixed the child packages, i called one of them from its now xml config free parent. i was really shocked and disappointed to see that it again had the wrong server in the connection. p  pHow could this happen p  pi also noticed through wordpad that the config file was  updated. my hypothesis is that when the parents configuration updated the connection manager, SSIS strongautomatically updated the now corrected config filestrong and broke it again.p  pdoes SSIS really update config files automatically when components of it change is it really bidirectional like this if so its totally confusing behavior  like a ping pong ball, or putting fingers in dykes. i am getting ready to recommend that we never use XML configurations.   p

I found and table and plot combination in famous journal NEJM and it look like this img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comjy4Ar.png altenter image description herep  pHow can I reproduce this kind of table and forest plot combination in R Thanks.p
Negative 3739 pI need to perform update operations on documents in which I need to rotate some values in an array. MongoDB update queries currently do not allow you to codepopcode and then codepushcode on the same field in an update. After searching for advice online, I decided that codedb.evalcode would be most appropriate for my use since it ensures atomicity and the operation that Im performing is very short so it wont lock up the db for too long.p  pHeres an example of something Im trying to dop  precodedb.evalfunction id, newVal      doc  db.collection.findOneid id     doc.values.shift     doc.values.pushnewVal     db.collection.savedoc , id, newVal codepre  pAnd this works perfectly I then enabled mongoDB profiling to see how many milliseconds the codeevalcode command was taking and Id always get results of less that 1 millisecondp  precode gt db.system.profile.findop command, millis 1    millis  0    millis  0   ... codepre  pThis is good news to me, except that my application is in python, so Im using a pymongo client to perform the codeevalcode commands. The data above is from the mongo shell But now, when I run identical codeevalcode commands using pymongop  precodeconn  pymongo.Connectionmongoserverhostname db  conn.mydb  db.evalfunction id, newVal      doc  db.collection.findOneid id     doc.values.shift     doc.values.pushnewVal     db.collection.savedoc , id, newval codepre  pI get very different profiling resultsp  precodegt db.system.profile.findop command, millis 1   millis  13   millis  14   millis  14  ... codepre  pIs there something fundamentally different about running the same codeevalcode commands from within the mongo shell and pymongo that results in the server taking 14ms more to run identical commands from pymongop

Negative 3739 pIm looking for the fastest solution to looking up an integer Value using a sorted integer array Key.p  pThe Keys are integer arrays and have a fixed length of 3 and each array is sorted.br The Value is an integer.p  pMy data guarantees that there are only EVER one OR two sorted arrays that have the same content. Each array has a unique index.p  pIm trying to find the matching pairs of arrays.p  pMy thought is to use a dictionary Im prototyping in C and will move to Cp  pFor each array, Ill look in the dictionary and see if its already there. If it is, I remove it from the dictionary. If I dont find it in the dictionary then its either a singleton or its the first of a matching pair so Ill add it to the dictionary.p  pMy question is this  give then very specific guarantees on the data, whats the best container  given that speed is my primary concern Also, any recommendations on appropriate fast hashing functions or compare functions for sorted integer arrays would be appreciated.p

Negative 3739 pI have been coming back to this snippet powershell code for a while and I cant seem to find the solution.  Basically, I have a Textbox in a WinForm and I input names into the textbox like, ckcTsetg, minintKLV, bbcada, tyleass and others.  When I place them into the textbox I click this filterout button and the following ckcTsetg, minintKLV, is filtered out which is correct.  The problem Im having is the others that are not to be filtered out are removed as well or they are never reached.  When I click the filter button my goal is that the text in logOutputBox.TEXT will be filteredout then the filtered list will pass to the other box objOutputBox.TEXT by objOutputBox.TEXT  Numbered.  Instead it is completely filter the whole list..  If I grab the valid names before hand they are passed to the objOutputBox.TEXT no problem.  I tried a few different things but nothing seems to work.

Negative 3739 pI have a wfc VS 2010C program that has been running on a Win03 Server for 6 months without issue. The app uses a public key for a remote server to send a request and then our private key to decrypt the response that comes back. p  pOur cert was about to expire so we issued a new one. We gave the public key to the remote people and installed the private key file on the server, which is a password protect P12. I also installed it on my development machine.p  pNo problems in the development machine. I can send requests and get response just as before. My development machine is a 64bit Win7. On the Win03 server production machine I get the following error Could not establish trust relationship for the SSLTLS secure channel with authority public key name of remote server.p  pThe public key for the remote server has a valid date and a valid chain in my cert store. There are two certs in the chain above this key and both of them have valid dates and chains. I have uninstalled and reinstalled all of the certs and cant get past this. I have no idea what is causing it.p  pWhen I Google Could not establish trust relationship for the SSLTLS secure channel with authority I see dozens of solutions for fixing the same problem and they all involve code changes. This does not seem to be what Im looking for. The code runs fine in the development machine and until this morning ran fine on the production sever. The only thing that changed was our cert.p  pThe one thing I did notice was that the Win03 server does not have Local Computer Cert Store, so it is impossible for me to install certs there. When I import certs I have sometimes let the wizard decide where to put certs and others times told it where to put the certs. Both with the same response. I am always logged in as administrator and always run the application under administrator.p  pAny idea what is causing my problemsp  pltemUPDATEem I have the same problem on my development PC when I run the compiled program. However, when I run the compiled program and try and view the output with Fiddler, I get the message below from Fiddler. If I say yes, the requests come back as expected.

Negative 3739 pI am interested in building a Rails based system for handling the display and organization of large amounts of photos. This is sort of like Flickr but smaller.

Negative 3739 pI am developing an application using Jboss AS 7, CDI, JPA, and some other resources bundled. p  pstrongMy question isstrong When I create a project in Eclipse using the mavenjbosswebapparchetype it generates some files, which I have been extensively studying and trying to get along with. The problem is that sometimes I see myself a little bit confused whether I am using Hibernate resources or JPA resources. p  pSecond question When I use multiple OneToMany relationships in the same Entity I notice two behaviors p  pa Without specifying EAGER type for Fetch, it deploys the application but when I try to use the list it gives me the LazyInitializationException error so vastly discussed here. p  pb When I specify Eager for the FetchType on the ToMany relationship it just doesnt deploys the application. It gives me the error Cannot instantiate multiple bags. p  pHere is the problematic piece of codep  precodeOneToManycascade  CascadeType.ALL, mappedBy  teamUser , fetch  FetchType.EAGER private CollectionltUsersgt usersCollection  OneToManycascade  CascadeType.ALL, mappedBy  teamRanking , fetch  FetchType.LAZY private CollectionltRankinggt rankingCollection  NotNull OneToManycascade  CascadeType.ALL, mappedBy  teamModality , fetch  FetchType.LAZY private CollectionltModalitygt modalitiesCollection  public Teams     public TeamsLong idteam , String name      this.id  idteam     this.name  name  codepre  pI have been reading about this and people told me that JPA does not support FetchType.EAGER for multiple realtionships in the same Entity. But I need to use multiple relationships in this entity in specific. I dont know what to do anymore, because I have tried several approaches, Lazy fetching, and all of them present some kind of issue. For example, if I leave only one FetchType.EAGER in the class then it deploys my app but it doesnt runs properly because when I try to fetch a List from the database it gives me the error strongLazyInitializationExceptionstrong, and when I try to put all of them using the FetchType.EAGER it just doesnt deploy because it gives the error Cannot instantiate multiple bags.p  pSo my issues here are related top  p1 Mavenjbosswebapparchetype uses hibernate or jpa or both 2 How can I attack this problem of using multiple OneToMany relationships in an Entity And although I know that fetching eagerly the Collections in the model is not the best approach because when the system grows I will probably have performance issues right So how can I properly work with Lazy loadingp
Negative 3739 pI am trying to map my image point by point to 3 dimensional space.p  pFor example, if my original image has intensity of 100 at location codeXcode, I want to plot this point in 3D location codeYcode with intensity of 100. I want to repeat this steps for every pointpixel, and get a final image. My biggest problem is that I want to do it point by point.p  pI appreciate any comments or advice. Thank you.p  pp  pp.s.p  pAs I was writing this question, I just came up with an idea. I know how to print whole image into certain locationshape in 3D by using codewarpcode function. Instead of using my whole image as an argument to warp function, if I give one point intensity value and one 3D point as arguments for warp function, and repeat this steps for every image point, will I get a descent looking final image in 3D If there is a better function to use, please let me know.p

Negative 3739 pWhen I move a fullCalendar events div out of its container div or even out of the calendar div using .appendTo, .append, .insertBefore, or even .clonetrue, true.insertBefore ... , it loses its onClick binding. That is to say my callback initially passed to the fullCalendar constructor doesnt fire anymore. I hope I didnt make an obvious mistake, Im new to javascript and fullCalendar.p  pinteresting fact in chrome dev tools, moving the events anywhere in the dom manually click an drag them around preserves their bindings. because of that I thought itd be a piece of cake to make a custom listView, but moving the event divs programmatically does erase the onClick events every time. if anyone knows the exact reason for the dev tools behavior Im very curious to see if I can replicate this behavior with codep  pthe html structure isp  precodeltdiv idcalendar  gt ltdiv classfccontent  gt     lttable classfcview fcviewmonth fcgridgt  lttablegt day header, moved by code     ltdiv  gt... ltdivgt     this is the event container, also moved by the code below     ltdiv classfcview fcviewbasicDay fcgrid ... gt         lttable classfcview fcviewmonth fcgridgt  lttablegt normal day header, intact         ltdiv  gt ... ltdivgt     normal event container, intact codepre  phere is the javascript that moves the table day header and event container divs outp  precodevar fcViewBasicDay  .fcview.fcviewbasicDay.fcgrid  var table  fcViewBasicDay.children.fcborderseparate table day header table.clonetrue.insertBeforefcViewBasicDay  var eventcontainer  table.next event container div eventcontainer.clonetrue, true.insertBeforefcViewBasicDay codepre  pother interesting fact if I change the last line  I clone the original event div and append it in its original place, and move the real one out, like thisp  precodeevent1moved.insertBeforefcViewBasicDay inserting the real div event event1moved.clonetrue, true.appendTofcViewBasicDay keeping a cloned one in place of the real codepre  p...then fullCalendar doesnt refresh with new events when I press next day  it refreshes with the same event on the next day. p  pif I just move it without replacing, the page loads forever infinite loop. its as if cloning that div erases some kind of markor recognized by fullCalendar.p  pP.S.

Negative 3739 pi am investigating the autosuggest behavior of solr, but id like to accomplish the followingp  pAs the user types sth. in, an autosuggest shall provide grouped information  including indexed data. For instance typing Op may suggest OpenLayers and Opodo, which both are part of the index, but are different in terms of type. In result, rather than just suggesting the word to client, id like to provide meta information for all possible suggested words, being grouped by type.p  pE.g.p  pTextfield [Op      ]p  pSuggestionp  p[Websites] Opodop  h2h2  p[Framework] OpenLayersp  pAnother solution would be, defining another query to solr with all suggestions, group those and then deliver view to client. However it would be great to not be forced to query solr multiple times, if it may not be necessary.p  pI also wonder, if instead of suggesting the words, just querying userinput via xx, interpreting these and deliver view may be a proper way to get what i want.p  pThanks in advance.p

In other words when one thread coderetrycodes on codewriteSyncChancode and another thread blocks reaches a codereadSyncChancode, or vice versa, I want the value to be transferred along the channel. In all other cases, both sides should be in a coderetrycode state and thus react to a change in codeshouldReadVarcode, so that the read or write can be cancelled.p  pThe nave approach described in the article linked above using two codeTcodecodeMVarcodes is of course not possible. Because the data structure is synchronous, it is impossible to use it within two a hrefhttphackage.haskell.orgpackagesarchivebaselatestdochtmlGHCConcSync.htmlv3aatomicallycodeatomicallycodea blocks, because you cannot change one codeTMVarcode and wait for another codeTMVarcode to be changed in an atomic context.p  pInstead, I am looking for a kind of partial atomicity, where I can commit a certain part of a transaction and only roll it back when certain variables change, but not others. If I have msg and ack variables like the first example in the article above, I want to be able to write to the msg variable, then wait for either a value to arrive on ack, or for my other transactional variables to change. If other transactional variables change, the whole atomic block should be retried, and if an ack value arrives, the transaction should continue as it was in the previous state. For the reading side, something similar should happen, except I would of course be reading from msg and writing to ack.p  pIs this possible to do using GHC STM, or do I need to do manual MVarrollback handlingp

Negative 3739 pIs it possible to define a pointer to an unknown numeric type, say codeintcode or codedoublecode, that always returns a specific type, say codedoublecode, on dereferencingp  pI started doing this,p  precodeint    a  7 double b  3.14  void c  staticcastltvoidgtampa void d  staticcastltvoidgtampb  double e  staticcastltdoublegtc double f  staticcastltdoublegtd codepre  pbut of course, casting an codeintcode to a codedoublecode is just going to produce gibberish for codeecode since wed be reinterpreting the internal bits for an codeintcode as if they were in codedoublecode format.p  pI tried in earnest to answer in advance emwhyem Id need to do this, since certainly there must be a better design option, but the explanation got wordy. In short, it has to do with legacy code, some parts of which I cant modify, and since were planning on rewriting the affected components anyway, Im currently investigating whether a workaround is possible.p  pIn case my watereddown version is emtooem watered down, heres one more level of detail. Im working with a method that emmustem return a codedoublecode, by dereferencing what used to be a codevoidcode pointer to a codedoublecode in shared memory, but now may point to an codeintcode too. There is a hook thats invoked when the pointer is set to point to another location, at which point its known whether its going to point to a codedoublecode or an codeintcode. So the only thing I can think of doing, is storing the type or setting a flag in a member variable during that hook, and casting to a pointer of that type before dereferencing.p  pBut I was hoping someone would know a handy trick or technique I may have missed. Some other way of storing pointers or organizing types so that I wont have to modify the hook at all Id really like to avoid doing that, for other, cumbersometoexplain reasons.p

Here is what I use to Hide OnTrayClickp  precodeprocedure TMainWindow.TrayIcon1ClickSender TObject var   I  Integer begin   if Application.MainForm.Visible then begin      Hide      Application.MainForm.Visible  FALSE   end else begin      Restore      Application.MainForm.Visible  TRUE     WindowState  wsNormal     Application.BringToFront      Workaround for ModalForms      for I  0 to Screen.FormCount1 do begin       if fsModal in Screen.Forms[I].FormState then begin         Screen.Forms[I].BringToFront         Screen.Forms[I].SetFocus         break  Stop looking for more ModalForms       end     end   end end codepre  pThis example works just fine if there are no other Modal Forms open. But if there is a ModalForm open and restore my MainForm, the ModalForm seems to be behind the MainForm and I cant reach it. How can I activatefocus the ModalForm and put it in front of my MainForm after my MainForm has been restored My codeApplication.MainFormOnTaskbarcode is set to codeFalsecodep  pEDIT If a ModalForm is open and I restore my MainForm, both of the forms wont focus at all.p
Negative 3739 pI have a web form, which does the following.p  ol lipon Page init I have a dropdown that gets populated. this part works fine and its  enclosed in codeifIsPostBack code routine. This part works fine.pli lipNow when I select a value from dropdownlist, then all of my text box fields are populated with values from database, with field grayed out from editing. This happens with in a codeifIsPostBack code which is also fine.pli lipI have a check box, upon clicking the check box, all of the textbox fields are now available for editing. This also happens within a if IsPostBack  for renabling all of the textbox fields in the routine  p  precodeprotected  void performUpdateCheckedChangedobject sender, EventArgs e      if performUpdate.Checked              performDeactivate.Enabled  false          txtFirstName.Enabled  true         txtLastName.Enabled  true          txtContactNumber.Enabled  true         just enabling all of the textbox fields do not worry about closing brackets. codepreli ol  pNow coming to the problem, when I change the text on the textbox and click submit  which has a routine to update  the database, Database is not updated.

codeifIsPostBackcode, because it has to query the db and prepopulate the text fields.

Why is it that none of my textbox changed value is captured and submitted to the database The form just send back everything as is with a new time stamp on the codeUpdateDatecode column. Any help is appreciated. Thanks.p
Negative 3739 pI have been trying to use Hibernate Search with JPA for two days and I have everything compiling cleanly and running without any obvious errors. However, when I try to create an initial index, the program runs and prints out each object it is indexing using manual indexing, then prints the Indexing Completed message. No no errors are thrown,  but the main method never exits. I am running in Eclipse Kepler in a Maven project with jre1.7 so I can kill the processing by hitting the red stop button. If I do that, then do a file search for index files, I dont find any. If I run my search program, I get java.lang.IllegalArgumentException None of the specified entity types or any of their subclasses are indexed.p  pI would really appreaciate any suggestions on how to get this to work.

Negative 3739 pA target SPA is suppose to have few very complicated forms say, up to 30 controls in some forms. Lets skip discussion about bad practice to use such forms  Im agree with you  The form is a filter to get data from server and present it in paginated list or table with sorting. Target clients are from desktop to tablets.p  pIn some discussion I have met an opinion AngularJS architecture isnt suitable for such complicated forms. In particular, this opinion was motivated by the fact, that high fields amount results in big computation work as far as AngularJS polls all the fields binds on any event.p  pIs the conclusion validp  pIn opposite case  do you know hrefs of examples of complicated forms running under AngularJSp

Negative 3739 pI was not able to find a clear answer to my question, maybe I used the wrong search termp  pI want to record many images from a camera, with no compression or lossless compression, on a not so powerful device with one single solid drive. After investigating, I have decided that, if any, the compression will be simply png image by image this is not part of the discussion. Given these constraints, I want to be able to record at maximum possible frequency from the camera. The bottleneck is the only one hard drive speed. I want to use the RAM for queuing, and the few available cores for compressing the images in parallel, so that theres less data to write.p  pOnce the data is compressed, do I get any gain in writing speed if I stream all the bytes in one single file, or, considering that I am working with a solid drive, can I just write one file lets say about 1 or 2 MB per image still working at the maximum disk bandwidth or very close to it, like 90p  pI dont know if it matters, this will be done using C and its libraries.p

Negative 3739 pI am trying to use the WinSCP .NET assembly V5.1.7.0 for FTP protocol but I am having difficulty with file paths on the target server.p  pThe problem is any connection to the server using either the WinSCP executable or the .NET assembly within my own software seems to be routed instantly to the users subdirectory e.g. codehomezildcode, but the files need to be uploaded to a different directory e.g. codehometestcode, for which the user has sufficient permissions verified by performing the required operations manually through the WinSCP executable. If I try to set the remote path to codehometestcode or codehometestcode the absolute path it actually uses a relative path e.g. codehomezildhometestcode in both cases. I thought the .NET assembly only ever used absolute paths, so this is a surprise. Unfortunately I cannot find a way to set the path to the desired location codehometestcode.p  pCan somebody please explain what I am doing wrong here I have tried searching the documentation and WinSCP forums already but remain stuck.p  pstrongEDIT Additional informationstrongp  pCodep  pre classlangcsharp prettyprintoverridecodepublic bool Uploadstring remoteDirectory, ListltFileInfogt filesToUpload      bool success  false      try              using Session session  new Session                                          session.ExecutablePath  sessionExecutablePath             session.OpensessionOptions              foreach FileInfo fi in filesToUpload                               fi.FullName XXXpremiumpartybanner.gif                  remoteDirectory homestoragetest                 TransferOperationResult transferResult  session.PutFilesfi.FullName, remoteDirectory                 transferResult.Check                 if transferResult.IsSuccess                                      success  true                                  else                                       TO DO  write an error message ideally for each failed item.                                                 catch               return success  codepre  pI have not used logging yet, however if I can get that working I will post logs here too.p  pI have blanked out most of the file path on the local computer, however please note that it includes Japanese characters.p  pFinally, note that I experience the same problem with codesession.ListDirectorycode as well.p  pstrongEDIT2 Log filestrongp  precode. 20131118 172633.064   . 20131118 172633.064 WinSCP Version 5.1.7 Build 3446 OS 6.1.7601 Service Pack 1 . 20131118 172633.064 Configuration nul . 20131118 172633.065 Local account jkleePCjamieh . 20131118 172633.065 Working directory CProgram Files x86WinSCP . 20131118 172633.065 Process ID 1156 . 20131118 172633.065 Commandline CProgram Files x86WinSCPWinSCP.exe xmllogCUsersjamiehAppDataLocalTempwscp12BC.00EB2115.tmp xmlgroups nointeractiveinput dotnet517  ininul logCUsersjamiehDesktoplog1.log  console consoleinstance4796348 . 20131118 172633.065 Time zone Current GMT9, Standard GMT9, DST GMT10, DST Start 18991230, DST End 18991230 . 20131118 172633.065 Login time 20131118 172633 . 20131118 172633.065  . 20131118 172633.065 Session name XX.X.X.X AdHoc session . 20131118 172633.065 Host name X.X.X.X Port 21 . 20131118 172633.065 User name X Password Yes, Key file No . 20131118 172633.065 Tunnel No . 20131118 172633.065 Transfer Protocol FTP . 20131118 172633.065 Ping type C, Ping interval 30 sec Timeout 15 sec . 20131118 172633.065 Proxy none . 20131118 172633.065 FTP FTPS None Passive Yes [Force IP A] List all A . 20131118 172633.065 Local directory default, Remote directory home, Update Yes, Cache Yes . 20131118 172633.065 Cache directory changes Yes, Permanent Yes . 20131118 172633.065 DST mode 1 Timezone offset 0h 0m . 20131118 172633.065  . 20131118 172633.068 Connecting to X.X.X.X ... . 20131118 172633.086 Connected with X.X.X.X.

Negative 3739 pI have a functions class that does various functions shocking, I know. One such function is to return a list of public holidays for the given years. Each calculation has its own private function, so the public function really just compiles the various holidays into a list.p  pNow I want to run some tests on this, obviously I cant run tests on the private methods, so I pull out the list in the TestInitialize method and then work with that for various tests.p  pThe problem is, say I pull out New Years Day with something like codelist.SingleOrDefaultp gt p.HolidayName.EqualsNew Years Daycode, its then best to check if its null or not before running the intended test it should be on a weekday, which as far as I can tell is two asserts in itself....p  pSo, two questions I suppose.br 1. Is this situation an exception to the rule strong1 assert per unit teststrong Or do I need to separate out the null assertion and the weekend assertionbr 2. As far as I can tell, there would be two assertions to make sure its not on a weekend one to check if day of week is not equal to saturday and one to check if day of week is not equal to sunday. Or am I wrong herep

Negative 3739 pI am an amateur pilot working on some airspace modeling experiments. What I am trying to achieve is a tool for easily creating crosssections of airspace, i.e. 3D airspace to 2D. So in the end I would like to have an image similar to this created a hrefhttprobbi.free.frivaoproceduresairspace.JPG relnofollowairspace examplea. Accuracy is not important as these crosssections would not be used for navigational purposes, but for trainingvisualization only. Hence coordinate geometry is enough, and no geodesic calculations are needed.p  pCurrently I am storing GeoJSON 2D geometries all polygons in my database with additional metadata containing lower and upper altitude limits of each airspace element. Therefore I am effectively only showing 2D data on my OpenLayers and Leaflet.js maps.p  pI want the user to be able to draw a linestring over the map see the green linestring in the picture below, strokewidth dramatically increased for demonstration purposes. This I can do with OpenLayers or Leaflet. The outcome should be a 1dimensional crosssection of the 2D elements intersecting with the userdrawn line, as in this very artistic illustration by mep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comisS1w.jpg altCross section 2D gt 1Dp  pClarification if the length of the output 1dimensional crosssection is for example 1L, then the contents of the crosssection in the example should be a set of the following geometries 1 black line between 0.1L and 0.5L and 2 a red line between 0.7L and 0.825L.p  pThe user interface part is doable, and it would be running on top of OpenLayers or Leaflet. I have also found several algorithms in various languages for determining if two lines intersect and even to find out the intersection point. I can use Raphael.js then to draw the crosssection.p  pI should be able to do all this in a day or two... But I was wondering strongif there was an easier path to take For example, does anyone know of a software library that would enable calculation of such crosssectionsstrong that I am trying to achieve Oh, please dont mention those 10,000 GIS packages .p  pAs this will be a web application, I am mostly looking into Javascript, Perl or PHP solutions. a hrefhttpsgithub.commaxogdengeojsonjsutils relnofollowGeoJSON Utilities for JavaScripta looks quite promising for calculating intersections, but I wonder if there are othersp

I can directly access all of the TestModes that are defined, change the value and have that change persist everywhere. The problem comes when I try to run the store function within the TestModeGroup class. It seems that I have a local copy of the TestModes that gets updated, but not the original TestMode. Im sure that this is a pretty simple problem but Im struggling. C is not my specialty, and OOP even less so.p  pHeres a quick example for a dummy testmode I createdp  precodeoutputDUMMYTESTMODE Initial Value d, DUMMYADMTestModeGroup.getTMValDUMMYTESTMODE DUMMYTESTMODE.setValue1 outputDUMMYTESTMODE Set to 1 Value d, DUMMYADMTestModeGroup.getTMValDUMMYTESTMODE DUMMYTESTMODE.setValue0 outputDUMMYTESTMODE Set to 0 Value d, DUMMYADMTestModeGroup.getTMValDUMMYTESTMODE DUMMYADMTestModeGroup.store22,1 outputDUMMYTESTMODE Set to 1 Value d, DUMMYADMTestModeGroup.getTMValDUMMYTESTMODE codepre  pdoing the .setValue works fine, but doing the .store does not. When I print out the value it comes back as 0. Within the .store function I do a printout, though, and that gives the right value of 1. Somehow I think I am simply altering a copy of the original vector, but I just cant figure it out. Ive been driving myself crazy and nobody Ive talked to knows enough about C to help. Does anybody have any insight as to where Ive screwed upp

I cant even tell which features are mutually exclusive.p  pa hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combwebdevarchive20130703understandingowinformsauthenticationinmvc5.aspxThis documenta says the old ASP.NET codeFormsAuthenticationModulecode doesnt support Claims, but the new OWIN doesnt support cookieless. Yet, I get the feeling that OWIN is intended to be the goforward featurep  ol liDoes the product roadmap say which method is the goforward for webappsli liIs ClaimsAuthenticationManager synonymous with OWIN Forms Authentication for web appsli liAre the ClaimsAuthenticationManager and a global IAuthenticationFilter mutually exclusiveli ol  pA push in the right direction would be appreciated, my brain is fried on this.p

Negative 3739 pI am currently working on a game to where there are different codeMovieClipcode objects that are added to the stage by a timer event array. p  pThese movie clips are handled by the codeMouseEvent.MOUSEDOWNcode, so when ever the user touches the correct object that is displayed on the screen, then the codenScorecode adds 1 point but what I wanted to do was after a random amount of time or a random amount of points that the user gets I want one of the objects to no longer be active so if you touch the object that is not active then the user loses. Then after a random time or score the object changes again and you have to only touch that object and not the previous one displayed on the screen etc...p  pSo I created two mouse event listeners like sop  precodemSquare.addEventListenerMouseEvent.MOUSEDOWN, SquareNotActivated mSquare.addEventListenerMouseEvent.MOUSEDOWN, SquareIsActivated codepre  pso in my SquareIsActivated function I have another function called codeSquareActivatecode which has the following codep  precodeprivate function SquareActivatesquareDisplayObjectvoid                 nScore      updateHighScore     updateCurrentScore            codepre  pIn my SquareNotActivated function its the same thing i have a function calledcodesquareNotActivecode which has the following codep  precodeprivate function squareNotActivesquareDisplayObjectvoid          nLives   codepre  pThen for another Movie Clip object called codemPopcodeI have the same setup. p  pI was going to try and make multiple codeifcode statements for the codenScorecode to handle the change of event listeners as well as the display object i was going to try and do it like thisp  precodeprivate function checkNScorevoid       if nScore gt 2               then remove a mouse listener for one object and add another         stage.addChildpopIcon         popIcon.x  stage.stageWidth  2  180         popIcon.y  stage.stageHeight  2  300                         if nScore gt 4                  Remove Square icon         popIcon.destroyPopIcon          Add new Square icon         stage.addChildsquareIcon         squareIcon.x  stage.stageWidth  2  180         squareIcon.y  stage.stageHeight  2  300       codepre  pBut I know there has to be a way to call them randomly maybe a timer object that generates a random codeMovieClipcode that the user has to touch then putting all other movie clips to remove a life instead of multiple codeifcode statements.

Negative 3739 pIve run into a bit of a performance issue with Hibernate and Im stuck.p  pIve got a nested foreach that iterates firstly through a map and then through each key within the map to create an object.p  precodeforMapltString, Objectgt csvRow  csvRows     Contact contact   new Contact     contact.setContactIdnextContactId     forString key  csvRow.keySet              contact.setDetailskey, csvRow.getkey         contactList.addContactcontact          nextContactId  codepre  pMy problem arises in that the above code takes roughly 10 seconds to run. This is with a CSV input of about 2MB, but this service has to handle a file of 200MB at least efficiently. The reason Im stuck is that the code below runs in roughly 1.6 seconds but only creates a single instance of a Contact object which is fair enough and I do see why this is occuring.p  precodeContact contact   new Contact forMapltString, Objectgt csvRow  csvRows      contact.setContactIdnextContactId      forString key  csvRow.keySet              contact.setDetailskey, csvRow.getkey         contactList.addContactcontact          nextContactId  codepre  pI have tried the usual things like manually setting the objects id to null during each iteration of processing a key. Just to make things clearer, a contact object is not supposed to represent a complete person, rather it represents a piece of information for a contact. Each contact will have the same contactId, and I have a wrapper object to tie it all together, but that isnt pertinent to my question.p  pMy question is thus How can I keep the performance of the latter while still creating all the objects I need. Also I need to keep the object structure I have because I have no control over the source CSV which may be missing data left right and center, hence the object structure that Im using. If you need more information, Im eagerly awaiting your reply.p  pEDIT 1 Using Hibernate 4.2.8, Spring 3.2.6p

Negative 3739 pIm making a winforms application, whose purpose is to write a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiInternationalPhoneticAlphabet relnofollowIPAa symbols to a textbox using key combinations. The user presses keys while focused on a RichTextBox. Some keycombinations, such as Ctrl  S, will simply produce a character and wait for the next keypress, such as codecode. Other key combinations will produce a different character when you repeatedly press the same key while holding Ctrl. For example, if I press Ctrl then A, codecode will be typed, but if I press A again while still holding Ctrl, codecode will be deleted and codecode will appear instead. It will keep cycling through these two keys until the player releases Ctrl or presses a different key.p  pIm stuck trying to implement this behaviour, though. This is a rough idea of what Ive got so far the main stumbling block is that I dont know how to pause in the middle of a loop and read a keypress, using Formsp  precodePrivate Sub IPAtextKeyPresssender As Object, e As KeyEventArgs Handles IPAtext.KeyDown     Dim AChars As Char  ,      Dim Counter As Integer  0     Select Case e.Modifiers         Case Keys.Control             Select Case e.KeyCode                 Case Keys.A                     While e.Modifiers  Keys.Control And e.KeyCode  Keys.A                         IPAtext.AppendTextACharsCounter                          Pause for keypress. If keypress  A then complete loop, if keypress is A again then increase counter.                          Counter  Counter  1 Mod AChars.Count Increments the counter so that it cycles back to 0 when it goes past the count of AChars.                          Only execute the line below if keypress is A.                          IPAtext.Text  IPAtext.Text.RemoveIPAtext.TextLength  1 Remove the last character from the textbox.

Negative 3739 pI am writing an application that will run on Android and iOS tablets, supporting multiple screen sizes on both platforms, and both landscape and portrait orientations.p  pThe application uses a ListView, and I would like to make changes to the content in the ListView row depending on the tablet orientation.p  pUsing landscape orientation, the ListView row should include text and graphics next to each other.  Portrait orientation, the graphics should appear below the text. p  pI was able to pull this off on iOS by creating two views that contain different ListViews, showing the appropriate view based on the orientation.  Unfortunately, Im not able to duplicate these results on Android. I used a similar view by orientation method in other areas of the app and both platforms supported it, so it appears the ListView is causing the issue.p  pIve included a small demo app below that mirrors these symptoms text color green on portrait and red on landscape, no images for simplicityp  precodevar win  Ti.UI.createWindowbackgroundColor white  var viewPortrait  Ti.UI.createView   top 20,   bottom 20,   left 10,   right 10  var templatePortrait     childTemplates [      type Ti.UI.Label,      bindId info,     properties       color green,      left 5, width 200dip, height 200dip,      textAlign right     ,   ]  var listViewPortrait  Ti.UI.createListView   templates  templatep templatePortrait ,   defaultItemTemplate templatep   var viewLandscape  Ti.UI.createView   top 20,   bottom 20,   left 10,   right 10  var templateLandscape     childTemplates [      type Ti.UI.Label,      bindId info,     properties        color red,       left 5, width 200dip, height 200dip,       textAlign right         ]  var listViewLandscape  Ti.UI.createListView   templates  templatel templateLandscape ,   defaultItemTemplate templatel   var sections  [] var section  Ti.UI.createListSection var data  [    propertiesheight 160dip, info text Line text number 1,    propertiesheight 160dip, info text Line text number 2,    propertiesheight 160dip, info text Line text number 3, ] section.setItemsdata sections.pushsection  listViewPortrait.setSectionssections viewPortrait.addlistViewPortrait  listViewLandscape.setSectionssections viewLandscape.addlistViewLandscape  win.addviewPortrait win.addviewLandscape win.open  Ti.Gesture.addEventListenerorientationchange, function      if Ti.Gesture.isLandscape  true      viewPortrait.hide     viewLandscape.show    else      viewPortrait.show     viewLandscape.hide      codepre  pOn Android, the text color never turns red. When I remark out viewLandscape.show in the orientationchange listener, the ListView disappears entirely because viewPortrait.hide, also proving the listener is running.p  pI understand the initial view showing both viewPortrait and viewLandscape is not ideal, but this is only a test amp I would expect that as the orientation changes the orientationchange event listener would clean that up. It appears to work as I would expect on iOS.p  pI have two questions. p  ol lipWhy doesnt the .show method work as I would expect on Android with a ListViewpli lipIs there a better way to handle orientation changes overall  I have read the Reacting to orientation changes section of Titaniums a hrefhttpdocs.appcelerator.comtitaniumlatestguideOrientationsection29004932OrientationReactingtoorientationchanges relnofollowOrientation documentationa, but am unclear on how I could fire an event that would actually change the ListView after the template has already been loaded apparently templates cannot be changed after a ListView is created, and a setTemplate method does not exist.pli ol  pThanks for any helpp

Negative 3739 pI have a few MySQL tables in a snail management game users, races, jars, snails.

Negative 3739 pI wanted to write some template functions to handle type punning in a defined way, so I came up with these two functions. The first takes an object and converts it with punning to another. It ensures that both types are POD and of equal size. The second was intended to simply take any pointer as if void but still check to make sure that the pointer was to a POD type. The problem I ran into is if I pass a nonconst pointer then the first function will get used instead.

Negative 3739 pis it possible to have a complex inheritance structure serialized and deserialized with jackson what are the annotations for it for example if I had the following classesp  precodeInheritance JsonTypeInfo     use  JsonTypeInfo.Id.NAME,     include  JsonTypeInfo.As.PROPERTY,     property  type JsonSubTypes      Typevalue  Dog.class,name  dog      Typevalue  Cat.class,name  cat   public class Animal implements Serializable  id long id  String name   codepre  pthis of course is the parent class. I know this is correct if cat and dog do not have any inheriting classes. if I want subclasses of dogs what would I need to change in both the animal class and the dog classp  phere is the second class just for referencep  precodeJsonTypeNamedog public class Dog extends Animal implements Serializable     all my props etc here  codepre  phow would I make a retriever class and a yorki class that inherit from both animal and dog that I could cast to either one and have jackson not freak out at me.p

Negative 3739 pI am using GAE SDK 1.8.9 with Java 1.7 build 45.  For the datastore, I am using Datanucleus JDO v2.  I have deployed code to production to update a counter for each new order request and am having a couple of consistency issues occurring that I believe are related to the processing of the requests from different servers within a few seconds of each other.  The datastore entity consists of a unique key generated by my app, a couple of date fields, and an orderId counter.  There are only a few of these entities in the datastore.p  pHere is a subset of my logic...p  pkeyId is an instance variable of type String within a StoreWrapper classp  pThe newOrderId method within the StoreWrapper class should fetch the desired Store entity based on the keyId within the datastore, increment the entitys orderId value,  update the entity back to the datastore with the updated value, and finally return the updated value or 0 if an error occurs to the caller.  The fetching, incrementing, and updating all occur within a JDO transaction using the .begin and .commit method for a transaction.p  pThe newOrderId method within the Store class simply increments the orderId value plus some logic to allow it to rollover once it reaches a ceiling.p  ppublic int newOrderId      int orderId  0p  precodePersistenceManager pm  PMF.get.getPersistenceManager Transaction tx  pm.currentTransaction  Store tempStore  null try      tx.begin  Use a transaction to modify value read, update, write     tempStore  pm.getObjectByIdStore.class, keyId     tempStore.newOrderId     pm.makePersistenttempStore  Problem occurs regardless if this statement exists or not     tx.commit     orderId  tempStore.getOrderId  catch JDOObjectNotFoundException e       Do new store stuff     ...  catch JDOUserException e      System.out.printlne.getMessage  catch JDODataStoreException e      System.out.printlne.getMessage  catch JDOCanRetryException e      System.out.printlne.getMessage  catch JDOOptimisticVerificationException e      System.out.printlne.getMessage  catch JDOFatalException e      System.out.printlne.getMessage  catch JDOException e      System.out.printlne.getMessage  catch Exception e      System.out.printlne.getMessage  finally      if tx.isActive         tx.rollback     pm.close   return orderId codepre  pp  pWhen I submit several requests to place an order over a short period, I notice duplicate order numbers in another datastore for the orders.  My research has concluded this occurs when multiple instances are processing the requests.  In the logs, I can see that each time this occurs, the instance is different for the duplicates.  It is my understanding that the entity group defaults to the root which would be the case for this situation given the simple nature of the entity since I dont specify a parent when generating the key, but nowhere can I find a clear understanding as to why the behavior is acting like eventual consistency rather than strong consistency.  Ive placed several catches for the various exceptions, but see no evidence that any of these are occurring in the logs.  Ive even set the threadsafe to false so only one request is processed per instance and it still occurs.  Is there some setting that must be set to enforce strong consistency across the multiple instancesp

Negative 3739 pRecently I tried to figure out where the application Meet Mobiles data was being pulled from.  This is mostly out of curiosity as I noticed they have this free app for AndroidiOS but nothing available from a computer which struck me as odd.p  pI set up fiddler on my computer with my phone using my computer as a proxy to access the internet, but when I do this Meet Mobile is not able to fetch data, even though I can use the browser to navigate the web without issue.  I followed this guide to set up my proxy a hrefhttpwww.cantoni.org20131106captureandroidwebtrafficfiddler relnofollowhttpwww.cantoni.org20131106captureandroidwebtrafficfiddlerap  pI have discovered that the main site the data is being pulled from is a hrefhttpsawmobile.active.com relnofollowhttpsawmobile.active.coma, and I believe it is being pulled via port 443.  However, I cannot figure out the correct syntax to query from this site which I believe the application uses JSON.p  pPlease let me know if there is a better way to go about capturing the web requests my application is sending off to its home base.  This is mostly an exercise of curiosity, and Im excited to see what potential answers there are.p  pCheersp

Negative 3739 pI really didnt get how signal handlers work especially with forks. So i need to do this exercise but i couldnt get it work properly.p  pMy main program makes 5 forks, each fork prints simply 10 messages with its pid. So the purpose of the program, when i send a SIGINT signal via keyboardCtrlc it should print, a single SIGINT arrived, if two SIGINT arrives between one second, it should print double SIGINT arrived and should terminate the whole program. So when i launch my program, it handles first two SIGINTthat i send the second more than 1 second after the first one but then it doesnt handle single SIGINT and neither double SIGINT. p  pSo im very confused about signals. Forks continue to stamp messages.

Negative 3739 pIve had to revisit this and was asked to produce a density plot showing the frequency histogram data with a smoothed line. Ive used codegeomfreqpolycode but that came out all clunky.  p  pI have a plot which joins geomhistogram with codegeomdensitycode on the same scaled y axis and is a very nice plot but I would like to have the same colour aesthetics i.e. by factor year on the density curves as they are on the histogram and but without the fill in density plot. Ive tried several different things but this gives me the closest albeit losing the colour scale 0 to 1 on the codegeomdensitycode. Here is my code, plot and sample data. Ive tried to combine two plots a codegeomhistogramcode with a codegeomdensitycode but to no avail. I get the error.

This is because the android plugin will complain if it   finds the same jar file twice when dexing the project and all its   dependencies. Note that right now you cant actually use a local aar   file even if you only reference it once.p      pOne way to fix this is to deploy the artifact in a repository. While   its possible, it might not be convenient due to the overhead of   managing such a repository.p      pAnother option is to create a new Gradle subproject, and to make this   projects published artifact be the jar or aar file that you want to   reuse. Then you can simply have other Gradle subprojects depend on   this new subproject.p      pIn this new subproject, simply create a build.gradle with the   followingp      pconfigurations.createdefault p      partifacts.adddefault, filesomelib.jarp blockquote

And then I triedp  precodegit add . git commit git push codepre  pWhen I do the push, I get an error message stating that the updates were rejected because a pushed branch tip is behind its remote counterpart.br Im currently googling this error but I would like to know if fundamentally, Im doing something that I shouldnt. p
Negative 3739 pMy GUI shows the vehicles in my emparkem, and vehicles that I want to set emavailablesem in two different strongVehicleTablesstrong classes that extend JTable.  For availables I intend that these vehicles can be observed from an emagentem thirdpart software. Both the tables show the descriptions of Vehicles in the rows...for this I have created strongVehicleTableModelstrong and strongVehiclestrong classes. The Vehicle class is an abstract class and his subclasses are Car, Truck, Trailer, etc. .p  pYou can see a snapshot of my software img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comf5vS4.png altenter image description herep  pMy problems are these In my current implementation I dont think of manage really good the strongemupdatesstrong of the rowsem. You can see in VehicleTableModel fire... methods and in ShipperAgentGUI coordinators and listeners. I think I have partially resolved this problem with the use of the strongCoordinatorstrong inner class for the updates between tables, but I dont know how optimize these.

Negative 3739 pI am using SPRING SAML implementation and acting as a SPEg ALPHA. I am able to execute SP initiated SSO and being able to authenticate user with the IDP. No issues in this implementation.p  pBut within my application, I need to access another SPEgBETA url which is linked to the same IDP. Both ALPHA and BETA service providers are trusted by the same IDP. In this scenario, after ALPHA authenticating a user with the IDP through SP INIT SSO, I am being asked to enter credentials again when the redirect happens to BETA SP URL. I understand that the SP carries different sessions.p  pHow can I enable the login in BETA SP with the same SAMLCredential which is authenticated through ALPHA SP. After going through a few documentations, I see that it is possible through IDP INIT SSO.p  pCan anyone tell me how to configure my application to be able to handle SP INIT SSO and as well IDP INIT SSOp  pALPHA SP is shibboleth and other SP is EZPROXYp

I suspected that it might be something with the input format of the matrix b. I think that theres lack of clarity on the description of array b for the function mklscsrmm placed in the MKL reference manual. Thus I changed b format, in this example and it worked I placed elements position in this order 2.0, 5.0, 1.0, 2.0 But I did the same for another 3x3 example I coded and it didnt work so I think it may be just a coincidence.

Negative 3739 pI am trying to decide how to implement image uploading functionality on my flask app.  I am currently using FlaskUploads to get the job done and it seems to work pretty well.  However, I have no idea if it is very secure, which could be a huge issue since file uploading is involved.  FlaskUploads doesnt really provide detailed information on the implementation of their service, so I havent gained any insight by looking through the documentation.  However, I saw that on Flasks official documentation they included an example of file uploads using Werkzeug, which seems to have some extra methods intended for file security.  I cant seem to find anything on the web that sheds light on which one is more secure.  Has anyone here with more web security experience ever examined one or both of these alternatives and come to a definite conclusion on this issuep

Negative 3739 pI have implemented below code gridControl.DataSource  CusColumnListp  pCusColumnList is of type MyBindingList which inherits BindingList, in my case T is class MyColumn. The binding works well.p  pBut now my problem comes, I dont want the data source to bind to every column in CusColumnList, I only want it binds to column whose name contains ABC or whose display name contains XYZ. I tried to set p  pgridControl.DataSource  CusColumnList.Wherecolumn  column.Name.ContainsABC  column.DisplayName.ContainsXYZp  pBut seems it doesnt work. I also tried to create another bindinglist collection MyTempCusColumnList of type MyBindingList, and in the Get method of this MyTempCusColumnList, I just return every item in CusColumnList where the name or display name qualifies. But in this way, every time when CusColumnList is updated, I need to manually update MyTempCusColumnList.p  pI wonder whether there is a better way to archive this goal with just CusColumnList. Thanksp

I know that is not a big deal and that just in very rare cases e.g. you play dirty with emServicesBaseem derived instances in the emMainem method the lack of that line could impact the performance of the app, but still not have sense to me have a emDisposalem method implementation like that and not add a line like emcomponents.Addthis.eventLog1em.

Negative 3739 pI am trying to configure our Node.js application to be deployed with Amazon Elastic Beanstalk.p  pActually I did a few configuration files inside .ebextensions to enable Websockets, doing yum installs for several modules and to install some custom software we need.p  pSo far the App deployment works and all configured software is installed by Beanstalk.p  pThe Problem I have is that the nodejs user wich runs the node application, doesnt have permission to execute the commandline tools installed by our beanstalk custom config. p  pTo be more concretep  ol lipThe app supports user file uploads and the uploaded files are saved to some temp folder on the instance that works like it should.pli lipThen the app does a commandline execution to convert the uploaded file in to a custom file format, whats executing something like homeec2userconverterbin convert filename output filename.pli ol  pAt this point I get this error   [Error spawn EACCES] code EACCES, errno EACCES, syscall spawn p  pOverall the app requires several commandline tools for such conversion tasks to run correctly. Actually they all have the same problem. Even tools installed by yum, such as Imagemagick, are not beeing executed by the app.p  pManually, by using the ec2user account, I am able to execute all these, all files are in place at the right system paths and they work fine. So all installations seem to work right.p  pI already tried to grant permissions to the user nodejs manually and did chmod the files, but this doesnt seem to take any effect here.p  pBig question is.. how can I grant the required permissions to the nodejs user or as alternative how to use a defined User to execute node.jsp

Negative 3739 pConsider I have a struct like thisp  precodestruct X     int somePtr     uint16t someCounter  codepre  pI use this struct extensively in very huge arrays hundreds of millions of codeXcodes. Since C aligns the pointer to an 8byte boundary, the struct uses up 16 bytes. Without this alignment, the struct would only use 10 bytes which is what I want to achieve, because the extra 6 bytes really cost a lot of memory.p  pSo I tried this using char arrays and the union hackp  precodestruct X     char somePtr[8]     uint16t someCounter      int getPtr         union U  int ptr char chars[8]          U u         u.chars  somePtr         return u.ptr       codepre  pThis yields the desired 10 byte struct. My question now is What are the drawbacks of this approach Does it trigger undefined behaviour Is this the best way to achieve packed structs in C11 or are there ones which are bettercleaner Is using such packed structs a good idea if a have huge arrays of the codeXcode structsp  pMy Platform is x86 linux, but it would be cool if the solution was fully portable.p

Negative 3739 pWe would like to start a Ecommerce website with about 20K products. The inventory of every product would be controlled at the city level. Each city in the country will have its own inventory count. Also, price and tax structure per city will differ. Assuming about 3000 cities in my country, I believe this will be a massive website.p  pAlso, the webfront has to be a singlepage application which currently Magento does not have. There will be periodic promotions per city. Certain products will be offered at a discount. The company may want to even sell vegetables. The cutsomer may purchase 0.25 kg onions.p  pThe traffic on the site is expected to be similar to Amazon.p  pMy question Is Magento suitable to serve as a backend system for such a website with every city being modelled as either a site or a storep  pDo you foresee any issues with Magento for such a systemp  pThanksp

Negative 3739 pI am working on a program that has multiple tabs, each tab containing multiple buttons that when clicked execute a SQL call in a BackgroundWorker object.  Once a button has been clicked the other buttons are disabled as long as the SQL process is workingp  pBecause some of these SQL calls can take upwards of an hour I am using the BackgroundWorker so that the GUI still responds to user input i.e., changing tabs but the buttons are disabled until the current SQL process has completed.p  pOne of the feature requests is to change the color of the currently selected tabs header font to green normally black to indicate that one of the buttons from this tab is the one that started the currently running SQL.  Once the SQL is complete the font color should return to black.p  pIs it possible to do this with a styledatatrigger  I cannot think of a way to apply a style to the currently selected tab once the button is pressed and then maintain that coloring if I switch tabs while the background worker is still working.p  pMy other thought on this would be a method that changes the tab header font color via code whenever I click a button and then change it back once the background worker has completed but this would require updating all the ButtonClicked methods.p  pI am open to any other solutions as well.p  pI know about the asyncawait feature but cannot change the code that executes the SQL using BackgroundWorker, so please no suggestions to use asyncawait.p

Negative 3739 pHello Stack Overflow, p  pSo, I created a ASP REST API with WebAPI 2.2 in Visual Studio 2013. This API returns data from a database in the form of JSON object back to a client calling. Now, I deployed this API to an IIS Distribution on one of our servers running SQL Server 2008, which is running IIS 7.p  pWhen making a call to the API we are hit with a 404 error code every time. When I run this API locally it works perfectly fine.p  pI am unsure on how to continue as ive exhausted most solutions on the net. This stems from redeploying, reinstalling IIS, adding cors which are still on so its not CORS related to OUR knowledge and playing around with the settings in IIS such as application pools. p  pAny suggestions or pointers would be greatly appreciated. If this question is a little vague, please let me know what kind of information you need. p  pThank you. p

I need to sample from this vector about 1000 times, however the sample size that I need to use is a noninteger, for example 3.66666. Obviously when I input this in, it rounds down to 3. What Id like to do is take multiple samples, at the sizes of the two integers outside the noninteger number for example 3 and 4. Hopefully, the output would give a series of samples, varying between sizes 3 and 4, but the average sample size of the 1000 samples would be 3.666666. If these could be stored in a matrix that would be ideal.p  pThis is further complicated as I have a series of different non integer values that need to be used as a sample size, each sampled 1000 times also. These are currently stored in a vector, sample.size lt c3.6666, 4.25, 5.3 p  pFinally, each of the samples in the vector have a unique weightprobability for their sampling. In taking just 1 sample, I know you can create a vector representing the weightprobability for each value in the original value, however with this further complicated scenario, I dont know even know where to begin with this.p  pIm not entirely sure if this entire process can be done, nor do I really know where to start, but any help would be appreciated.p

Negative 3739 pBackgroundp  pIm always searching for a language to replace Java for game development. Kotlin looks promising with a good IDE support and Java interop. But one of the FPS killers for a game on Android especially is GC usage. So, some libraries like libgdx are using pools of objects, custom collections and other tricks to avoid frequent GC run.

Also, the shadow will have some transparency, and this rules out adding a separate background to inline Runs. I tried this, and where the shadows overlapped the opacity values formed a darker color.p  pI have investigated so far TextBox, TextBlock and RichTextBox. I tried changing Run.Background, or selecting the text and changing the selection foregroundbackground. With no success, none of these are doing exactly what I need.p  pBasically what I think I need is a text formatting feature, that would allow me to create a properly wrapped text from a string IN MEMORY, with separate Runs for each and every line. After this, I could find out the pixel length of each Run, add these Runs manually to a RichTextBox or to a TextBlock, with manually created rectangles behind them. Unfortunately, when I add text to a TextBlock or a RichTextBox, wrapping is applied to the Run itself, instead of creating separate Runs for each wrapped line.p

Negative 3739 pSo I have a postview that I cant get to work properly, and flexbox seemed like the answer from heaven that I was looking for. Except, I cant seem to figure it out properly no matter what... p  pIf you look at a hrefhttpwww.cssdesk.comA7RFZ relnofollowthisa code, theres two vertical divs that should both stretch as more content gets added to either. The div where more content appears grows accordingly, but I want the other div to match in length, and so the bottom edges to be aligned to the bottom of the flex box. The repeating images behind the two founder buttons and the LOTS OF TEXT should then fill up empty space down to the bottom where the bottomedge images are.p  pIve been at this for a good week now and cant figure it out... Im sorry if this is a really simple thing or Im being dense about css, Im still learning. Any help would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 3739 pI have an ASP.Net application that accesses user data from a SQL database.p  ul liVisual Studio Version 2012li liWindows Server 2012 Standard 6.2li liSql Server 2012li liProgram in Service since 112007 with problem having never happened previouslyli ul  pstrongProblemstrong First reported by 2 of my customers but I was not experiencing the problem until after a recent MS update.p  pUnsure of the particulars of those updates or whether it was only a coincident.p  pLog into application and go around to a few pages, all seems ok, than I select a new Active Company auto filters list screens by Active Company ID from a session variable, changing active company changes the ID stored in the session variable, everything works fine for a while 1  4 mins switching between screens and even different active companies, than at one point I go to a page that Ive been to several times that worked fine and it shows everything from the last time I accessed it  literally the identical page from a few mins ago. I change to another page and it appears to be updated, go back to the screen that did not update and it no matter what, will not update again. I query the database and it is indicating the correct active company ID and query the session variable and that too is correct.p  p The strange thing is I can wait 4 5 mins I just stop doing anything and than try to access the page again and now it updates.p  pI have been beating at this now for almost 2 weeks and have not been able to determine to source of the problem. I literally have tried every settings for session caching I could read up on with no or minimal affect. Since our software utilizes session variables to hold user variables to control their environment like active company selection, I went to go as far as removing the session variables and making the profile.variables requiring Sql Session management with minimal affect.p  pIt seems to work fine for a few minutes or page accesses than once it stops updating the page, it will no longer update under any circumstance.p  pIt will occur on pretty much any combination of page changes after changing the active company, since it will actually change data displayed.p  pThis design has been out in the field for over 8 years now and is routinely brought uptodate with the latest dot.net compiler updates, .net framework and IronSpeed Designer engine updates. This error has never occurred before now. No update to the development tools took place prior to the appearance of this issue.p  pI tried various tests. Test 1  I added java code to reset each page.p  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt   function RefreshPage        window.location.reload    ltscriptgt codepre  pResult No changep  pTest 2 I stopped as soon as the page did not refresh and started timing when the page would update 1 2 mins or going back and forth between the change active company and the reports screen several timesp  pResult After 60  90 secs, the current page seemed to do an update the activity icon would appear than go away so I would than check the page the was not refreshing and it was now correct.p  pSince I was using the report page for my tests, I would run a report when the screen update failed, to see what active company it thought it was on since it was also reliant on the session variable, it was bringing up the correct report data, even though the page was not indicating the correct active company. Note Every one of our screens indicate the current user and active company name at the top, so it is easy to see when it is not updating.p  pAny direction as to where to look from here would be greatly appreciated, emIm at a lost as to what to check nowem.p  pP.S. I installed MS Message Analyzer and had it monitor up to the point where I get a failure. I have never user MS MA before so I dont have much of an idea as to what to look for, other than the operation status was indicating Found 302 for the Get and Post and Ok 200 for the page I received the problem for.p  pThanks in advancedp  pJohn Rp

Negative 3739 pMy application is an server application that accepts some predefined commands from user and displays respective output that is taken from XML files present at the server end.p  pFor parsing XML file I am using xercesc library version 3.1.2 from apache. The application works fine when ran manually on a terminal. p  pBut I wanted to run the application through telnet on a network so that I can give inputs to the application via telnet and receive output on a remote system too. For this I used inetd super server and added below line in inetd.confp  precodevterm stream tcp nowait root pathtomybinaryvterm vterm codepre  pThen added below line in etcservices to make it listen on port 5000p  precodevterm 5000tcp codepre  pAfter that when I tried to connect to my application I used to get below messagep  precodemsatyamsabayon programmingcppxml  telnet localhost 5000 Trying 1... Trying 127.0.0.1... Connected to localhost. Escape character is ]. Connection closed by foreign host. codepre  pWhen the above connection closed message came I thought I have not configured properly my application with inetd. So, I replaced my binary with a simple binary which didnt used any extra libraries. Just simple cins and couts, which worked perfectly fine.p  pThen it turns out to be something wrong with my application so for this I put whole lot of couts to identify what actually is happening. With this I found that one of the xercesc XML parsing library function is returning NULL and with this NULL reference I am trying to call a function in line below which is making my application dump as soon as it starts.p  pBut the thing is the same function is working fine when I run my application manually on a terminal. Full application is bit big so I have created a demo code which reproduces the problem. Here is my codep  precode    include ltxercescutilPlatformUtils.hppgt     include ltxercescparsersXercesDOMParser.hppgt     include ltxercescdomDOMDocument.hppgt     include ltxercescdomDOMElement.hppgt     include ltiostreamgt      using namespace std     using namespace xercesc  int main      try               init xerces XML Parser library         XMLPlatformUtilsInitialize          catch const XMLExceptionamp ex              cerr ltlt ex.getMessage ltlt endl            parse a XML file     XercesDOMParser parser  new XercesDOMParser     try              parsergtparsesample.xml          catch const XMLExceptionamp ex              cerr ltlt ex.getMessage ltlt endl            get the document reference     DOMDocument doc  parsergtgetDocument      if doc  NULL              cout ltltDoc is NULL ltlt endl            else do stuff further      like get root element     DOMElement root  docgtgetDocumentElement       print node name     string name  XMLStringtranscoderootgtgetTagName     cout ltlt Name  ltlt name ltlt endl      XMLPlatformUtilsTerminate return 0  codepre  pThe above code when compiled and ran manually does not go into that if condition which says Doc is NULL and successfully prints the root element tag name, but when I run this application behind inetd and when I telnet to it I am able to see Doc is NULL statement and after that same message Connection closed by foreign host. as my application would be probably dumping.p  pI am a bit out of brains now as I am not sure where to look exactly. As same code works when ran manually but not through inetd. So, I am thinking do we need to take some special attention while executing processes via inetd that uses shared libraries, like here I am using xercesc shared library for XML parsing. Or What else could be possibly wrong with my understanding or my code. How come the same library functions works perfectly fine when application ran manually and not working when ran via inetdp  pI tried the same using xinetd instead of inetd but same results.p

No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or       pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise,       except to obtain some advantage from it But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure     ltpgt   ltdivgt ltbodygt codepre  pHeres the editor as well a hrefhttpcodepen.ioJelanipenjbboQEeditors110 relnofollowhttpcodepen.ioJelanipenjbboQEeditors110ap  pAny help would be appreciated Thanks in advancep

This should allow me to call codeOtherClasscode interchangeably with the codeprojectcode object or with its name and then use codemarshalloadcode within the initialize method to load the serialized object. If the marshal file for some reason does exist than the initialize method should create a new one from scratch.p  pIs this the right approach At the moment I check for the existence of the marshal file from outdside the class and then load or create codeprojectcode as I need.
