I need to implement functionalities such as listing, sorting, filtering and pagination.p  pIm using Spring Boot as a starter and Spring Data Jpa for repository. Ive searched the Web for some examples about a complete solution that includes all the above functionalities. What I found included almost all of them, but appearently if there was pagination and sorting there wasnt filtering or viceversa.p  pNow Im storing the filter in a application object on session using codeModelAttributecode but I know that is now a good design because the applciation will extend and it becomes hard to maintain. Im also using codePagecode and codePaginationcode for pagination purpose and using codeSpecificationscode for filtering.p  pWhat I want is to submit all the data, i.e. search fields, sorted fields and current page, in a single request. Off course if the search fields are not empty the pagination will be reinitialize. p  pAnother thing is that I dont want to use jQuery  datatables but plain HTML and form submission.p  pHere are some tutorials and examples that I foundp  pa hrefhttpspringinpractice.com20120511paginationandsortingwithspringdatajpa relnofollowLink 1ap  pa hrefhttpwww.petrikainulainen.netprogrammingspringframeworkspringdatajpatutorialpartsevenpagination relnofollowLink 2ap  pThanks in advancep
Positive 95875 pAfter reading about the remote shell in the Spring Boot documentation I started playing around with it. I implemented a new codeCommandcode that produces a Stream of one of my database entities called company. This works fine. So I want to output my stream of companies in the console. This is done by calling codetoStringcode by default. While this seams reasonable there is also a way to get nicer results by using a Renderer. p  pImplementing one should be straight forward as I can delegate most of the work to one of the already existing ones.

Positive 95875 pIn my project, I have to current Maven modules setup p  precode Application   application code, using Spring Boot 1.2.6   E2Etesting has a dependency to Application  src      main          java              AbstractCucumberTest.java codepre  pBefore, this used to be a Spring 3 application serving JSP pages, so no Boot included. I refactored it to be a Boot application. p  pThe E2E testing setup basically built a WAR file of the application code, and the E2E module booted a Jetty server, running that WAR. All was well.  Now, after the refactor, not so much. p  pThe Jetty setup no longer works asis. When I boot the WAR, Im getting class loading exceptions, which are related to Jetty itself. Now, Im not hung up on Jetty, its just a testing container for me. So I started digging around in the Boot documentation, because I was convinced there had to be a way to make it all Bootiful, meaning I could simply boot the application when launching the tests. And there is, of course, so I ended up with these annotations on my AbstractCucumberTest p  precodeRunWithSpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class ContextConfigurationclasses  ApplicationConfig.class, loader  SpringApplicationContextLoader.class WebIntegrationTestspring.profiles.activelocal public abstract class AbstractCucumberTest extends SeleniumTest  codepre  pSo, basically, Im loading the application config of the application, and launching the Tomcat server from the test. And all rejoiced, because now the application was successfully booting upon launching a Cucumber test. The application boots, it reads the classpath, Liquibase boots, everything is working alright. I can call the Actuator endpoints, which all work fine. Even the REST endpoints of the application are all working, so Spring MVC is doing its thing. p  pHowever, 1 thing is not, and thats serving JSPs  and thats of course a deal breaker for E2E tests. Every time I surf to a page, I get the same unnerving 404 error. Before you ask yes, strongtomcatembedjasperstrong and strongjstlstrong are present. They are present in the application, I even added them to the E2E pom, no luck. In fact, these are the things I tried, but they all failed p  ul lipExcluding the tomcatembedjasper and jstl dependency from the applicationpli lipCopying over the JSPs from the application to the resources of the E2E modulepli lipSetting up my own CucumberConfig, which basically contained the same configuration as the ApplicationConfigpli ul  pIt just seems to me that the application cannot find the JSPs. Everything else is working just fine, just the JSPs are not foundserved. p  pDoes anyone have any thoughtsp  pOh, on a side note, I tried using the springbootmavenplugin, to try and boot the application that way. Problem is, though, that it cannot be forked. In the 1.2.6 release, the fork simply ... does not fork. When I say fork, I mean it in the Jetty way it boots the application, and gives control back to Maven. It instantiates a stop command, which Maven can call after all tests have run.  In the a hrefhttpdocs.spring.iospringbootdocscurrentSNAPSHOTmavenpluginexamplesitrandomport.html relnofollow1.3.0.BUILDSNAPSHOT versiona, it should be present using the start goal, but thats still not working for me. p  pstrong[EDIT]strong For what its worth, the Application module is configured to build a WAR file. So its emnotem JAR packaging.p

Positive 95875 pI am using Spring Boot for my application. Due to a particular need, I have my own strongemServletstrongem class that extends from the Spring strongemDispatcherServletemstrong. And I am pretty sure that I wont be the first one that is doing this.p  pEverything worked fine until I tried adding authenticationauthorization. I setup the authenticationauthorization as shown herep  pa hrefhttpsgithub.comspringprojectsspringdataexamplestreemasterrestsecurity relnofollowhttpsgithub.comspringprojectsspringdataexamplestreemasterrestsecurityap  pI use the strongemPreAuthorizeemstrong annotations on my REST controller methods to restrict access based on the type of operation such as GETPOST.p  pI get the error strongAuthenticationObject not found in SecurityContextHolderstrong when I try to POST something. What I did next was compare my application and a working Spring Boot Security example as in the example above by stepping through it to see what is happening. I discovered that in the working example, before the strongemdoServiceemstrong method of the DispatcherServlet is being invoked, filters such as BasicAuthenticationFilter and others come into the picture. I dont see these filters getting invoked in my application.p  pDue to the filters not being invoked I dont see the user information or the sessionid in the request object at all in my application. I do see that in the working example though. Moreover, I see that in the working example, the request and response objects gets wrapped in a strongemSecurityContextHolderemstrong Wrapper from the filter. Since filters dont get invoked in my application, the requestresponse objects never get wrapped. I suspect that the above error is related to this.p  pI guess that since I have my own Servlet class that extends the Spring Servlet, it is in essence saying to Spring that I will take control from there. This also means that I will have to do everything that normally Spring does for me.p  pMy questions are  p  ul lipAt what point in Spring Boot do the filters get invoked and how do I achieve this in my application before the request reaches my custom Servlet pli lipDo I have to inject them as Beans into my Main class  And in what order  should they be invokedpli ul  pThanks again,p

Positive 95875 pIm experimenting with building microservices using Spring Boot.p  pI have a backend API that receives ResponseEntity POST requests and processes it saving to database etc. Where Data is an Object of a selfcreated class.p  pNow I have a toplevel API that handles authentication,...

Negative 95875 pbr  Im trying to create a fairly extensive UserControl incorporating square controls into the design, and allowing resizing. Because the design calls for squares, I need all the columns in my TableLayoutPanels to be the same width, so that the contained, docked controls are also square.p  pUnfortunately, the behaviour of the TableLayoutPanel does not give me this result.br  Using a TableLayoutPanel with all columns set to use the same percentage of the Control gives in a set of 7 columns 6 columns of equal width, and a 7th column which is of variable width.br  I understand that this behaviour occurs because for 6 out of every 7 sizes, there are not an equal number of columnpixels to share around the 7 columns, and the 7th column is the overflow for this inequality.p  pWhat I guess I want is something like an 8th column that takes the overflow of the other 7 columns, allowing all 7 of the real columns to be of real equal widths, but for the 8th column to be allowed to be of 0 width.br  So far, I cannot find a setting which allows this behaviour.p  pCan anyone tell me how to get the TableLayoutPanel to do what I want, or am I going to have to start writing a lot of workaround codep  pEDITp  pIn response to Yacoders answer, I have added some code which demonstrates the problem, and another which shows an unsuccessful, naive attempt at solving it using standard features of the TableLayoutPanel and the Dock propertyp  pProblem demonstration   p  precodePublic Class Form1 Inherits System.Windows.Forms.Form Public Sub New     Me.InitializeComponent End Sub Form overrides dispose to clean up the component list. ltSystem.Diagnostics.DebuggerNonUserCodegt  Protected Overrides Sub DisposeByVal disposing As Boolean     Try         If disposing AndAlso components IsNot Nothing Then             components.Dispose         End If     Finally         MyBase.Disposedisposing     End Try End Sub  Required by the Windows Form Designer Private components As System.ComponentModel.IContainer  NOTE The following procedure is required by the Windows Form Designer It can be modified using the Windows Form Designer.

However when two classes ClassA and ClassB for example both consume the Singleton role it appears as they are both referring to a shared singleInstance variable.  If I call ClassAgetInstance it returns a reference to a ClassA object.  If I call ClassBgetInstance sometime later in the same script it returns a reference to an object of type ClassA even though I clearly called the getInstance method for ClassB.  If I dont use a role and actually copy and paste the code from the Singleton role into ClassA and ClassB it appears to work fine. Whats going on herep

Stallone is known for his machismo  and Hollywood action roles. Stallones film Rocky was inducted into the National Film Registry as well as having its film props placed in the Smithsonian Museum. Stallones use of the front entrance to the Philadelphia Museum of Art in the Rocky series led the area to be nicknamed the Rocky Steps.A commercial, educational, and cultural center, Philadelphia was once the secondlargest city in the British Empire  after London, and the social and geographical center of the original 13 American colonies. It was a centerpiece of early American history, host to many of the ideas and actions that gave birth to the American Revolution and independence.The American Revolution was the political upheaval during the last half of the 18th century in which thirteen colonies in North America joined together to break free from the British Empire, combining to become the United States of America. They first rejected the authority of the Parliament of Great Britain to govern them from overseas without representation, and then expelled all royal officials. By 1774 each colony had established a Provincial Congress, or an equivalent governmental institution, to form individual selfgoverning states.p blockquote

As an example, I have defined the following programp  precodepublic interface IMyInterface      void MyMethod   public class MyClass  IMyInterface      public void MyMethod             public class MyContainerltTgt where T  IMyInterface      public IListltTgt Contents  codepre  pI can then do this, which works just finep  precodeMyContainerltMyClassgt container  new MyContainerltMyClassgt container.Contents.Addnew MyClass codepre  pI have many classes that implement MyInterface. I would like to write a method that can accept all MyContainer objectsp  precodepublic void CallAllMethodsInContainerMyContainerltIMyInterfacegt container      foreach IMyInterface myClass in container.Contents              myClass.MyMethod       codepre  pNow, Id like to call this method.p  precodeMyContainerltMyClassgt container  new MyContainerltMyClassgt container.Contents.Addnew MyClass this.CallAllMethodsInContainercontainer codepre  pThat didnt work. Surely, because MyClass implements IMyInterface, I should be able to just cast itp  precodeMyContainerltIMyInterfacegt newContainer  MyContainerltIMyInterfacegtcontainer codepre  pThat didnt work either. I can definitely cast a normal MyClass to IMyInterfacep  precodeMyClass newClass  new MyClass IMyInterface myInterface  IMyInterfacenewClass codepre  pSo, at least I havent completely misunderstood that. I am unsure exactly how I am to write a method that accepts a generic collection of classes that conform to the same interface.p  pI have a plan to completely hack around this problem if need be, but I would really prefer to do it properly.p  pThank you in advance.p

Negative 95875 pIve got a C datastructure that is a required scratchpad for other computations.  Its not longlived, and its not frequently used so not performance critical.  However, it includes a random number generator amongst other updatable tracking fields, and while the actual value of the generator isnt important, it emisem important that the value is updated rather than copied and reused.  strongThis means that in general, objects of this class are passed by reference.strongp  pIf an instance is only needed once, the most natural approach is to construct them whereever needed perhaps using a factory method or a constructor, and then passing the scratchpad to the consuming method.  Consumers method signatures use pass by reference since they dont know this is the only use, but factory methods and constructors return by value  and you cant pass unnamed temporaries by reference.p  pIs there a way to avoid clogging the code with nasty temporary variables Id like to avoid things like the followingp  precodescratchpadtlttypeXlttypeY,potentiallymessygt, typename Tgt uselesstemp  factoryrngparm xyz.initializecomputationuselesstemp codepre  pI could make the scratchpad intrinsically codemutablecode and just label all parameters codeconst ampcode, but that doesnt strike me as bestpractice since its misleading, and I cant do this for classes I dont fully control.  Passing by rvalue reference would require adding overloads to all consumers of scratchpad, which kind of defeats the purpose  having clear and concise code.p  pGiven the fact that performance is not critical but code size and readability are, strongwhats the bestpractice approach to passing in such a scratchpadstrong  Using C0x features is OK if emrequiredem but preferably C03only features should suffice.p  pemstrongEditemstrong  To be clear, using a temporary is doable, its just unfortunate clutter in code Id like to avoid.  If you never give the temporary a name, its clearly only used once, and the fewer lines of code to read, the better.  Also, in constructors initializers, its impossible to declare temporaries.p

Negative 95875 pI have a question about Entity Framework and Linq to Entities. My .NET version is 4.0.

Negative 95875 pFundamentally, I would like to establish a callback to an Activity from an IntentService.  My question is very similar to the one answered herep  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3197335androidrestfulapiserviceAndroid restful API serviceap  pHowever, in the answer code, the activity code is seen as implementing a ResultReceiver.  Unless Im missing something, ResultReceiver is actually a class, so it cannot perform this implementation.p  pSo essentially, Im asking what would be the correct way to wire up a ResultReceiver to that service.  I get confused with Handler and ResultReceiver concepts with respect to this.  Any working sample code would be appreciated.p

But when I do so on my main container div, everything gets thrown offcenter and smashed up to the left side of the page.

It can originate in any module method, and has to be handled by a specific one. Having tons of trycatch blocks in every method doesnt seem right, and the only entry point that can handle any exception is outside of the module, and in the router. Module throws, module handles, but only router can actually catch. Sounds wrong.p  precodeclass module      public function constructamprouter          ...         routergtaddExceptionHandlerdbTableNotFoundException,                                       arraythis, installSchema        codepre  pOn other occasions there are events that need to be handled by the router itself. For example, module can request that the router proceeds as if it has received a special type of input, ignoring the real one. The router then has to recheck it against the rule set, and call appropriate methods.p  precode   public function someMethod          ...          throw routerRestartExceptionspecialinput     codepre  pOn other occasions events may require no handling other than passing them through to output, such as humaneyesonly errors.p  precode   public function someMethod          ...          throw humanEyesExceptionYou cant do that     codepre  pThis effectively leads me to thinking of two communication emaspectsem, because router and modules exchange both arbitrary return data emandem special control messages.p  pSo far the system control messages aspect is implemented by modules throwing exceptions, and the router catching. This requires that modules register two types of methods  one for processing input, and another for handling exceptions, which is probably smelly.p  pSome of the exceptions seem to affect flow control, and I believe using exceptions for that isnt a good practice either.p  pThe question stands, is there a best practice or a pattern for building this kind of twoaspect communication between router object and its dependent modulesp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pA thought along the way one way of improving the situation by detaching inmodule exception handling from the router could be using Observer pattern for custom Exceptionsp  precodepublic function constructamprouter     ...     dbTableNotFoundExceptionaddObserverarraythis, installSchema  codepre

Negative 95875 pI have a model in django with many fields almost 40. The model describes a clients underground lawn sprinkler system and, thus, has many attributes System Owner, install Date, Number of Zones, Valve Box Location, etc. I am building a webapp for the company to handle their daily business work processes. As a result, I need to display this model to the user the staff in a meaningful way so that they can be efficient and obtain the info they need without having to slog through mounds of text fields. p  pWith almost 40 fields, I had to break up the fields on the web page into logical sections. I used a jQuery tab to group similar fields. If I have, say, 10 fields grouped on one tab, I want to let the user change a few fields on that tab, hit save, and carry on. Right now I am using a form and the user hits save which is the forms submit button. p  pHere comes my question Can I do away with the HTML form and, instead, create dummy text input fields with an a href link to Save the group of fields. The link would be a jQuery function which sends the JSON formatted data to a django view. The view would update the model, and send back a JSON string of Success or Failure or something like that. This way, the user saves the data, but doesnt leave the page. p  pIs this way over the top code wise or would this be a logical way of handling thisp  pThanksp

I need your help to regroup and attack again.p  pstrongWhat Ive gotstrongp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com5TLR9.png altenter image description herep  pIve got a surfaceview and a circle as a bitmap. I need to rotate the bitmap as the user moves the finger around the circle edge. The faster the user slides, the more I need to rotate the image. Seems simple but not really easy to implement. p  pstrongWhat I needstrongp  pI need to calculate the angle on which to rotate the image on onDraw event. From what Ive thought so far I need two things  the angle between new touched point and the old one. Ive done a simple function that takes care of thisp  precode     private int getAngleBetweenTwoTouchedPointsdouble oldX, double oldY, double newX, double newY                return int Math.absMath.atan2newY  oldY, newX  oldX       codepre  pthe angle returned by this varies from 0 to 1 and I believe it is correct. By incrementing the image rotation matrix angle by this value I get a slow rotation, basically by 1 unit. So, there is a chance to work, but not ok yet.   so, the second thing I may need is the speed with which the user slides the finger around the screen. So basically something like thisp  protationAngle  angleBetweenTouchesspeedp  pSpeed, or velocity as I saw it named is the problem in my case, considering that I dont move only on X or Y but around the circle. I have no idea how to calculate it. I saw VelocityTracker on Android help but I dont know how it could help. p  pSo to recap I need to be able to rotate the image as the user moves the finger around the image border. Even simpler, when the user stops sliding, the pixel of the image that was below the finger on slide start should be the same when the slide stops. p  pAny help is greatly appreciated. Thank youp

Negative 95875 pI take it you are confused. So am I, but Ill try to formulate this as well as I can.p  pThe content management system I use has a thirdparty plugin installed that manipulates the output of the pages produced by the CMS. Thats what its supposed to do, and thats why I installed it, but theres one small part of those manipulations that I need to get rid of.p  pThe plugin looks for the codelttitlegtcode tag in the HTML output and then adds an unwanted tag right after it by replacing codelttitlegtcode with codelttitlegtltunwanted taggtcode.p  pYou might think, why not just dig into the plugin source and comment out that particular function Well, thats the kicker the plugin is encoded with Zend Guard, so I cant make heads nor tails of its source, and unfortunately the developer is not willing to assist.p  pOne other manipulation that I emwasem able to get rid of by myself, was the extra and again unwanted HTTP header it set for every page.p  pThe Zendencoded PHP file is loaded by a regular PHP file, and I was able to unset the above mentioned header by adding the following bit of code to the very bottom of this load file, before codegtcodep  pcodeheaderremoveXEnhancedBycodep  pIt works splendidly, but that was about as far as my experience and research could take me.p  pThe last thing, then, that I need to undo, is the manipulation of the title tag. I temporarily worked around it by changing all my codelttitlegtcode tags to codelttitle gtcode, but that seems hardly a proper workaround.p  pIf I can unset the header by placing codeheaderremoveXEnhancedBycode right before codegtcode, does that mean I can also use that same area to undo the addition of the unwanted tag after codelttitlegtcodep  pLets assume the plugin replaces codelttitlegtcode with codelttitlegtltbase hrefhttpwww.example.com gtcode on every page that is put out by the CMS.p  pHow would I go about undoing thatp

Negative 95875 pSo I ran into a little issue with validations  I created a validation to ensure that no users in a database share identical email addresses.  Then I created a user in the database.  Afterward, I said codeuser  User.find1code which returned the user I had just created.  Then I wanted to change its name so I said codeuser.name  New Namecode and then tried to use codeuser.savecode to save it back into the database.  However, this command isnt working anymore it returns false instead and I think it has to do with my uniqueness validation test.

Negative 95875 pI do not have much experience with SQL Reporting Services, but I am maintaining a report that other users created.p  pThey have 10 reports which all print fine on the development box and the production box.  They also have an Entire Event report that has all the other 10 reports as sub reports.  This shows any reports with data in them on the development box any of the sub reports without data are suppressed, which is fine.  However on the production box it looks like every sub report is suppressed regardless of data.  The report just shows a header and a blank page.p  pAny thoughts of where I can start debugging.  The environments seem the same to me as far as I can tell.

Negative 95875 pBelow I am using backbone js to fetch a collection. On the requests response, I would like to perform some logic on the collection to massage the data. I am modifying the parse method on the parent collection source types to attach a child collection source accounts and only include a source type if there are actually source accounts. p  pI dont want to render this without having all the data loaded primarily, so I figure with javascript the only way to be safe is with a success callback. p  pAs you can see in the below code, inside the parse function, I construct a new object called responseobject.

Negative 95875 pIm working with scikitlearn on building some predictive models with SVMs. I have a dataset with around 5000 examples and about 700 features.

Is this expected with different data and parameters C and gamma, Im using coderbfcode kernelp  p2 Im trying to use 64 bit python on windows to take advantage of the extra memory, but all my python processes seem to top at 1 gig in my task manager, I dont know if that has anything to do with the runtime.p  p3 I was using 32bit before and running on about the same dataset, and i remember though I didnt save down the results it being quite a bit faster. I used a third party build of scikitlearn for 64 bit windows, so I dont know if its better to try this on 32 bit python source a hrefhttpwww.lfd.uci.edugohlkepythonlibs relnofollowhttpwww.lfd.uci.edugohlkepythonlibsap  pAny suggestions on how I can reduce runtime would be greatly appreciated. I guess reducing the search space of my grid search will help but as Im unsure of even the range of optimal parameters, Id like to keep it as large as i can. If there are faster SVM implementations as well, please let me know, and I may try those.p  pAddendum I went back and tried running the 32bit version again. Its much faster for some reason. It took about 3 hours to get to where the 64bit version got to in 16 hours. Why would there be such a differencep

The above script works completely fine if I use codevar foo  document.getElementsByClassNamegridCellAltcode and include the information I am accessing in the page running the script, but when I try to use it on the xmlDoc DOM it doesnt work. To sum it up the only time the script doesnt work is when Im using the xmlDoc instead of document, and the codegetElementsbyClassNamecode in conjunction.  If I use document and getElementsByClassName its fine.  If I use xmlDoc and get codeelementsByTagNamecode its fine. p  pIm thinking the codegetElementsByClassNamecode isnt searching within the DOM nodes correctly, but even if I put codeclassgridCellAltcode somewhere in the root node of a test DOM it still doesnt find it.  Ive tried adding more information behind codefoo  xmlDoc.getElementsByClassNamegridCellAlt, info herecode but that doesnt seem to address the issue either.p

Negative 95875 pSo Ive been hunting around for a good way to utilize a webcam from within a C application. I tried a pinvoke dll which turned out to be inexplicably and irreproduceably buggy.

It works wonderfully...as long as VS is installed on the machine. Download and run that release build on anything that doesnt and it will throw an error claiming that it cant find WebCamLib.dll or one of its dependencies.

It works great, but Id like to be able to distribute this without additional installers or requiring VS 2010 to be installed on everything. What gives herep

It is all setup and values set within getView but when the softkeyboard pops up in the phone format getView gets called again logical but as soon as it hits 1 of the text type EditTexts the keyboard type switches back to text input.

Negative 95875 pI have a Rails 3.0.10 project using the minitestrails gem running in JRuby 1.6.5  Ruby 1.9.2. I would like to use all of our existing TestUnit test cases with minimal changes in order to start using Minitest. Right now I can run tests but many fail because fixtures are not being loaded. I have yet to figure out how to make that work. If I change ActionControllerTestCase to MiniTestUnitTestCase then the fixtures function doesnt work. Ive tried the links a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7628654usingminitestinrailsherea and the links within that one without any success. So the question is how to continue using ActionControllerTestCase with the MiniTest gem or how to switch to MiniTestUnitTestCase and have fixtures load.p

Negative 95875 pIm working with Ionic.Zlib.DeflateStream I think aka DotNetZip in C code and notice it doesnt have a BaseStream property like System.IO.Compression.DeflateStream does.  Is there any simple way to access this  Maybe a partial class or extension not really familiar with those concepts or just something Im overlooking, or an updated version of this libraryp  pUpdate I have function deep inside a large project that is given an Ionic.Zlib.DeflateStream as a paramater.  I know that the underlying stream is a MemoryStream, and I want to modify the code to seek to Position 0 in the underlying stream, write a few bytes, then return to the previos Position.  This is what we call a kludge, or dirtyhack, as opposed to rewriting a lot of code... but this is the solution we are looking for at this time, as opposed to something else that would require more retesting.  The few bytes in this part of the MemoryStream that need to be updated are not compressed, so modifying them outside the DeflateStream in this matter is fine.p

Negative 95875 pMy goal is this p  pSuppose that a random number r is generated every second. I would like to write an application preferably in C though if a language where this is easier is suggested Ill choose that so that the application prints r every second to the text field selected by the user at that instant. p  pHere is a use case a user is running 3 applications in win7 64 bit, the applications are notepad, chrome browser, and mspaint. The user selects mspaint through alttab and clicks on the text box tool. He creates a textbox on the screen and clicks on it so that the cursor is in the text box. During this process 5 seconds pass and the application has generated 5 random numbers, since the cursor was never located in a text field nothing was printed. The instant the cursor is in the text field a second has passed, and a new number is generated. This number prints to the text box. The user keeps the cursor in the text box, another second passes and the new random number will overwrite the previous random number and anything else in the text field with the new random number. If the user switches the cursor position to the url selection portion of chrome similar behavior should be exhibited. Similarly with the search field of google.com inside chrome, and again in notepad. If the cursor were in notepad for 3 seconds then every second the full textbox inside notepad would be replaced with a random number, at the end of the 3 seconds only the last random number will be in notepad. p  pIn short I want to be able to overwrite any text field selected by a user in win7. p  pAny help p

Negative 95875 pI have a bound datagridview with about 12 a million records and may be sorted by any column.  In the GUI user can select any number of rows sometimes all of them with CTRLA.  From another source I get a large list of record IDs up to 1000 and need to find out which of those IDs correspond to a selected row.  Ive tried many approaches, none of which perform fast enough.  For instancep  pLooping through the selected rows collection and looking for a match in the IDs list is out of the question because the SelectedRows count can be on the order of 12 million.p  pI also tried looping through the IDs list which is typically on the order of 1000 and for each ID do a BindingSource.FindId, Value which gives me the row index for each ID and I can then check if the Row is selected.  This works fine if the grid is sorted by ID, but if its not, the performance of Find is too poor to be called 1000 times.p  pIn short, i need a fast way to find the Row.Selected state for up to 1000 rows given the row object IDs.  It seems the DataGridView or DataBinding should be able to handle this but its not obvious how.  Thanks in advancep

Negative 95875 pI have seen similar questions here, but none of the answers seem to work in my case.p  pThe case is REALLY simple. I publish an article  this action is sent to fb using PHP using publishactions scope. All the calls seem fine. All setup on FB seems ok  the objects and actions are standard. I am the admin etc.p  pOn Facebook  I can see the action in the activity log. If I click on the timestamp in the activity log I can see the whole post, including the ogdescription etc. AFAICT this is what should also appear on the timeline. p  pBut its not showingp  pOne thing to note is in the activity log on the right hand side of the new entry for my action, the status is always allowed on timeline. But even if I change the status to shown on timeline, it is still not shown on the timeline.p  pIt must be something very simple. Facebook has the content not a scraping error, has registered the activity but just does not show the object in the timeline.p  pI also tested using the graph API explorer I get the same result, i.e. entry in activity log but not in timeline etc. I get an objectid returned  as expected. p  pJUST to add What I DO see as the User on the timeline is an Activity box at the top right hand side. p

Negative 95875 pSo, I know Linux kernel is quite heavy when considering lower scale embedded systems, but currently but were a 2 man team trying to see how to create our own embedded system. Im the one in charge of all software the other guy is a HW guy, and thus I would like to reuse existing libraries and frameworks as much as possible, and I would like to bounce off some ideas with gurus around here.p  pI am fairly comfortable in Linux, but the booting and initialization process is new to me, and I need to dive in to that soon enough. Any book recommendations are welcome as well I havent designed any embedded systems before.. Only own some ARM dev boards beagleboard and raspberry pi.p  pCurrent I have prototype of the software running on beagleboard already, and now were thinking how to minimize the cost, and to create something our own..p  pIts a system connected to the internet, and I need to run a tiny web server with some scripting support. Performance wise I dont think it needs to be too powerful. p  pI would like to minimize all bootloader etc work, since Im a one man SW team, and just concentrate on the application itself. Of course I understand that I need to configure our kernel for this, but this is indeed why I thought selecting some SoC would be good, since they usually have some linux and bootloaders ready..p  pFirst I thought that Cirrus EP9301 would be perfect, since it seems to be a good package, and not very expensive.. But it seems that its already in endoflife, and also support for this is very bad people on the cirrus forums constantly complain about it.p  pAre there some good choices for this kind of project, which would enable us easily to get linux kernel up and running, with still maintaining some kind of decent BOM hopefully 20USD or so p
Negative 95875 pI have a new FreeBSD 9.0 installation that is having trouble installing modules that require C via CPAN.

Negative 95875 pI have two divs as in the illustration below. The position of div 2 is fixed, so it sticks to the right side of the screen no matter how small it might be. If the screen is small, then the div 2 starts to overlap over div 1, which I do not want.

Negative 95875 pI am working with ARM assembly, where I have to write one subroutine for which I am following the ARM calling conventionthis will have to be integrated with some separate higher level implementation somewhere else  for passing parameters and return values. Now here is something I am not sure in general when working with assembly.p  pSo from the convention if I understand well the arguments are passed in order starting from registers r0  r4 and then for other arguments stacks are used. Return values are passed to r0. p  pNow here is what I am confused with. If I am supposed to save the context of r0 and pop it off after then there is no way to return the result, the only way it can be done is by corrupting the first argument. Is there a workaround somehow Thanks in advance guysp

Its tiny, clocking in at about 50 characters.p  pLooking at the a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidetopicsdatadatastorage.html relnofollowAndroid Storage Options pagea, they give a few choices, the simplest which seems to be shared preferences.

Negative 95875 pI am working on an app where i have 12 buttons and labels underneath on one of the views.  They are placed on the storyboard directly.  I want to make sure they will get properly repositioned in iPhone 5. The solution that i tried is just to deselect all the lines in the autosizing for all the buttons.  Now when i try it on iphone 5 the buttons get resized. The problem if i stretch the storyboard and move the buttons they get messed up when running on the smaller screen. So i can only position them on the smaller screen and then it seems to work.  The app does not rotate.  I would like to know if this is a good solution or there is a better solution for this case.  I would like for the app to support iOS 5p  pThank youp
Negative 95875 pI am writing a program where I have a 2D array of objects from a cell class, and I need to write a method where I pass a cell object as a parameter and I return an arraylist of cells that surround the cellN, S, E, W.  Each cell is given a location from the Point class.  What I am having trouble with is how to use the locations that I knowx, y1 is north to produce a cell.  Any help on this is appreciated.  Thank you.p

Negative 95875 pThis came up in a discussion with a colleague today.p  pThe Javadocs for Javas a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase6docsapijavalangIllegalStateException.htmlcodeIllegalStateExceptioncodea state that itp  blockquote   pSignals that a method has been invoked at an illegal or inappropriate time. In other words, the Java environment or Java application is not in an appropriate state for the requested operation.p blockquote  pAnd Effective Java says Item 60, page 248p  blockquote   pAnother commonly reused exception is IllegalStateException. This is generally the exception to throw if the invocation is illegal because of the state of the receiving object. For example, this would be the exception to throw if the caller attempted to use some object before it had been properly initialized.p blockquote  pIt seems theres a bit of discrepancy here. The second sentence of the javadocs makes it sound like the exception could describe a very broad condition about the Java execution state, but the description in Effective Java makes it sound like its used for conditions related specifically to the state of the state of the object whose method has been called.p  pThe usages Ive seen in the JDK e.g. collections, codeMatchercode and in Guava definitely seem to fall into the category that Effective Java talks about This object is in a state where this method cant be called. This also seems consistent with codeIllegalStateExceptioncodes sibling codeIllegalArgumentExceptioncode.p  pAre there any legitimate codeIllegalStateExceptioncode usages in the JDK that do relate to the Java environment or Java application Or do any best practices guides advocate using it for the broader execution state If not, why the heck are the javadocs phrased like that p

Negative 95875 pHow to install and setup HyperV role on Windows Server Std. 2008 R2 with SQL Server 2012 already installed.  SQL Server is the priority on this machine. Only one virtual machine will be installed and used to test disaster recovery restores from image backups of servers, when done testing the VM can be removed so we can test another server.  The other servers are similar or less powerful with less memory.p  pI am not planning on creating a partition for this.  We have plenty of space on our RAID drives for now.  I was thinking of using Static Memory and limit the Virtual Machine to 4 GB of RAM and set 12 GB for SQL Server.  The server to host HyperV is a Dell PowerEdge 2900 with  16 GB RAM, Intel Xeon, E5345 3.33 GHZ 2 processers.  p  pDiscussionp  ol liHow much memory will HyperV use if we do NOT have any Virtual machines installed or vms being usedtestedli liHow much memory will HyperV use if we do have a Virtual machine installed and we are testing the restore very basic testing.li liIs there a way to easily turn off HyperV when we do not need it or do we have to change the memory settings all the timeli ol  pstrongUPDATE Nov 9strongp  pI should have mentioned that the server roles that we have installed are  Active Directory, DNS, File Services, WSUS, IIS. Though IIS is only used for WSUS.  We use two domain controllers in our domain.  This is perhaps the biggest reason why we should not also have SQL server installed and add the HyperV role.  Thus we plan to buy a barebones refurbished Dell server to test disaster recovery and not use HyperV at all.  This keeps the testing of image restores off of our production server which I think is wise.p

This ensures that the Dlist implementation knows that it owns inserted objects, it is responsible for copying them if the list is copied, and it must destroy them if the list is destroyed.emp  pHere is my current implementation of insertFrontT op  precodevoid DlistinsertFrontT o    node insert  new node   insertgto  new To    insertgtnext  first   insertgtprev  last   first  insert  codepre  pThis seems wrong though.  What if T doesnt have a copy constructor  And how does this ensure sole ownership of the object in the listp  pCould I just dop  precodeinsertgto  o codepre  pIt seems like this is not safe, because if you hadp  precodeObject item  new Object dlist.insertFrontitem delete item codepre  pThen the item would be also be destroyed for the list.

Negative 95875 pI have a shopping website and I am using javascript to add items to cart. Every time I click on add to cart, it puts the name of the item in a div that represents the cart. I would like to keep the content of the cart on each page, so what I did isp  precodecartlink.attrhref, cart.phpapptab codepre  pWhere tab is an array containing all the items in the cart. I then use a GET to retrieve the elements of the cart on the cart.php page. But my problem is since I add items in the cart using JS, if the user changes page without clicking on the cart.phpapp link, tab will be erased and I have no way to recover tab. If the user clicks on the cart.php link, I can use a GET and store the content into a session and then use it on every page.p  pSo I would need a way to memorize the cart content if the user decides not to click cart.php.p  pThanksp

Were hoping we dont have to change the existing clustered index unless we absolutely have to but we are willing to do so. In SqlAzure AFAIK you cannot simply adjust the clustered index in an existing table  you have to create a new table with the desired clustered index and insert all records from the old table to the new table and handle all of the foreign key constraints and other table dependencies.p  pstrongALL sql select statements start with tenantidstrong in their linq to entities statements. p  precodeinvoiceitems.tenantid  thecurrenttenantid order by invoicedate codepre  pSome sql select statements just have an order  some have other join condition values when bringing in child tables likep  precodeinvoiceitems.tenantid  thecurrenttenantid and invoice.invoiceid  invoiceitems.invoiceid order by invoicedate codepre  pHere are a few ideas were open to others besides this  strongwhich of these would be best and whystrongp  h2PRIMARY KEY INDEX OPTIONSh2  pemTo speed up access to the tenants recordsemp  pstrongOption 1  Add a nonclustered index on tenantidstrongp  pInvoices tenantid uniqueidentifier, invoiceid uniqueidentifier primary key, billcustomerid uniqueidentifier, shipcustomerid uniqueidentifier, invoicedate datetime Foreign Keys tenantid, billcustomerid, shipcustomerid Indexes clustered on invoiceid, strongnonclustered on tenantidstrongp  pstrongOption 2  Change the primary key from primaryid to tenantid  primaryid and change the clustered index to tenantid  primaryid.strongp  pInvoices strongtenantid uniqueidentifier primary key, invoiceid uniqueidentifier primary keystrong, billcustomerid uniqueidentifier, shipcustomerid uniqueidentifier, invoicedate datetime Foreign Keys tenantid, billcustomerid, shipcustomerid Indexes strongclustered on tenantid  invoiceidstrongp  h2FOREIGN KEY INDEX OPTIONSh2  pemTo speed up joinsemp  pstrongOption 3  Add nonclustered indexes on all foreign key fields only on foreignkeyid.strongp  pInvoices tenantid uniqueidentifier, invoiceid uniqueidentifier primary key, billcustomerid uniqueidentifier, shipcustomerid uniqueidentifier, invoicedate datetime Foreign Keys tenantid, billcustomerid, shipcustomerid Indexes clustered on invoiceid, strongnonclustered on billcustomerid, nonclustered on shipcustomeridstrongp  pstrongOption 4  Change all foreign keys from foreignkeyid to tenantid  foreignkeyid and add an index on tenantid  foreignkeyidstrongp  pInvoices tenantid uniqueidentifier, invoiceid uniqueidentifier primary key, billcustomerid uniqueidentifier, shipcustomerid uniqueidentifier, invoicedate datetime Foreign Keys tenantid, strongtenantid  billcustomerid, tenantid  shipcustomeridstrong Indexes clustered on invoiceid, strongnonclustered on tenantid  billcustomerid, nonclustered on tenantid  shipcustomeridstrongp  h2SQL SELECT OPTIMIZATION INDEX OPTIONSh2  pemTo speed up often used queries like select fields from invoices where tenantid  value order by invoicedateemp  pstrongOption 5  add indexes on most often used sort order fields within each table besides tenantid.strong p  pInvoices tenantid uniqueidentifier, invoiceid uniqueidentifier primary key, billcustomerid uniqueidentifier, shipcustomerid uniqueidentifier, invoicedate datetime Foreign Keys tenantid, billcustomerid, shipcustomerid Indexes clustered on invoiceid, strongnonclustered on invoicedatestrongp  pstrongOption 6  add indexes on tenantid  most often used sort order field within each table and add nonclustered index on tenantid  most often used sort order fieldstrongp  pInvoices tenantid uniqueidentifier, invoiceid uniqueidentifier primary key, billcustomerid uniqueidentifier, shipcustomerid uniqueidentifier, invoicedate datetime Foreign Keys tenantid, billcustomerid, shipcustomerid Indexes clustered on invoiceid, strongnonclustered on tenantid  invoicedatestrongp

Negative 95875 pOnce and for all I want to get the R terminology right. However, none of the books I was reading was of big help, and it seems to me the authors choose the names sometimes arbitrarily. So, my question is when exactly are the names attribute, parameter, and argument usedp  pFrom what I read and understood so far, a parameter is what a function can take as input. For example if I have a function that calculates the sum of two values, codesumvalue1, value2code, value1 and value2 are the functions parameters.p  pIf we are calling a function, we call the values passed to the function arguments. For the sumfunction example, 23 and 48 would be the function arguments forp  precodesum23,48. codepre  pSo basically we call it parameter when we define a function, and we call it argument when we call the function so the arguments are passed to the functions parametersp  pBut what about attributes From what I understand, attributes are the equivalent of parameters in methods and methods are functions of a class objectp  pFor example, if I would have something likep  precodeheatmapmyData, ColvNA, RowvNA codepre  p... , would myData be an argument or attribute And what about codeColvNAcode and codeRowvNAcode Isnt heatmap a function and thus everything in the parentheses should be called argumentsp

Since a negative valued int can never hold the same value as char when it makes a comparison it needs to be promoted to int which then somehow signals the end of file.p  pI also get that without the parenthesis specified above the comparison codecode is done before the assignment but what does this actually mean What is it that happens to that function Also I printed the value of EOF and it was 1 what does the exercise mean when it says verify it is 0 or 1p

for your help in advance.p  pstrongEDITstrong The Oracle version is 11g, the restful webservice is in java. The listener becomes unresponsive after a few minutes of work which consists of running a small number of queries like 4 or 5 to retrieve less than 5 rows of a table in the database which consists of about 10 columns the work is not that heavy at all. The database consists of about 20 tables. In some of the queries, joins are being made using hibernates criteria between 2 or 3 tables, which are not that complicated and shouldnt be considered as heavy loads.p  pstrongEDIT 2strong The model uses some kind of a UnitOfWorkFactory to implement the repository pattern. For each request e.g. creating a new object, editing an existing object or searching the model creates a unitOfWork, in which a hibernate session will be created, do the job and then close the session.p

Negative 95875 pI am required to design a program on MATLAB that would create sound tones.p  pHowever, I have to send the tones out of phase with each other. I.E If the right ear is receiving the tone now, 0.5ms from now the left ear should receive the other tone. Hence the two tones are going to be roughly 180 degrees out of phase.p  pSo my question is how to program it such that the tone is first delivered to right ear then to left ear.p  pIs there a special MATLAB command for thatp  pNote The tone is 1000Hz frequency.p  pThank you.p

Negative 95875 pWe built a simple VOIP app for both Android and iPhone. You simply dial the caller id of another user, press call, and start talking to them.  The iPhone version works great, and we used a commercial API for the SIP functionality.  But the Android version doesnt work so well because of audio delay issues which seems to depend on which Android phone you have.  We used the following Android SIP library a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidetopicsconnectivitysip.html relnofollowhttpdeveloper.android.comguidetopicsconnectivitysip.htmla.p  pstrongSo my question is, which SIP library should we look at to solve our audio delaylatency issue for Android phones running OSes 4.0 and above  Assuming it is a SIP library issue.   If not, what else could it bestrongp  pNo heres a bit more historyp  pWhen we are making calls between one android phone to another android phone, there is too much delay in the audio. One person will say something, and it could take up to a full 12 seconds before the other person hears it. At the moment, this problem appears to be particular to Samsung devices , as opposed to other hardwares although our tests have been limited. So for example, a Galaxy Note 1 calling a GS3 experiences more delay than a Galaxy Note 1 calling Nexus 7 tablet Asus and Galaxy Note 1 calling a Xiaomi MI2 phone.  Were pretty sure weve eliminated our Asterisk server as the probable cause of delay, since iphone to iphone calls are great, and iphone to android calls are reasonable.p  pHere is a list of device speed tests, listed in ascending order of delayp  piphone to iphone fastest, no noticeable delayp  pandroid Samsung to iphone a little delay, but still acceptablep  pandroid samsung to android xiaomi MI2 a little delay, but still acceptablep  pandroid samsung to android asus too much delay, unacceptablep  pandroid samsung to android samsung really slow, unacceptablep  pRight now, my team is is leaning towards the idea that the Android SIP library we are using is not good enough a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidetopicsconnectivitysip.html relnofollowhttpdeveloper.android.comguidetopicsconnectivitysip.htmla. We are interested in using another SIP library to do the call.p  pWe have noticed that other Android SIP phones like CSipSimple also experiences this problem. p  pDoes anyone have ideas on how we can solve our audio delaylatency issuesp  pstrongAdditional Notesstrong We noticed there wasnt any audio delay when using Skype on Galaxy Note 1 to Skype on Galaxy S3.  So thats why we were thinking theres probably a solution to this problem via our choice of SIP library, or codec or something...p  pstrongAdditional Notesstrong  We know were using the G.711 Codec, incase that makes any difference.p

In reallife usage, you wouldnt want to immediately prompt someone to login         like this, for two reasons        1 JavaScript created popup windows are blocked by most browsers unless they         result from direct interaction from people using the app such as a mouse click        2 it is a bad experience to be continually prompted to login upon page load.

Note that at this stage there is no indication        of whether they are logged into the app. If they arent then theyll see the Login        dialog right after they log in to Facebook.

Negative 95875 pIm developing a RESTful web service using Jersey and Im going to be using a simple object cache that is updating its data by retrieving records from a database based on a timer. I plan on using a HashMap to store my retrieved data in this cache but my question is what is the best practice for updating this HashMap.p  pRight now my choices are making the HashMap volatile and anytime an update comes in, create a new HashMap and then assign it when it completes. I could also wrap the HashMap in a synchronized block or use a ReentrantReadWriteLock while updating the HashMap variable directly. I have also thought about using ConcurrentHashMap which seems to have some performance benefits. Are there any significant performance differences andor drawbacks in using one of these approaches over the otherp  pAlso, when a user updates or inserts a record through my web service API, is it best practice to update the local cache directly once I save the record in the DB or force the cache to do another big data retrievalp

Negative 95875 pIve set up Rails 4 ActionMailer to send me as site admin an email whenever a new user signs up registrationscreate  Im using Devise.p  pNow I would like for currentuser to be able to email the user whose profile they are currently viewing. So in codeusersshowcode Id like to have a form that simply generates an email codeto user.emailcode, codefrom currentuser.emailcode optionally overrideable via text input, and possibly a body to the message.p  pA record of the message is not important. For this implementation Im letting the users inboxes handle all of the history. In fact Id rather not store that data if its possible to just pass it through the modelcontroller. If the addition of body text necessitates the use of a codeMessagesControllercode then I would rather leave that out.p  pMany thanks.p

Negative 95875 pIn a WinForms application I run several BackgroundWorkers to send bulk email. No, its not spam, its corporate email.p  pFrom time to time, a strongSmtpException Failure sending mailstrong happens when sending the email. This SmtpException is thrown inside a trycatch and written in a log. However, when this exception in particular happens, it takes about 5 minutes to write the exception to the log and continue, after which every email fails with the same exception and it takes about 5 minutes for it to handle each failed email.p  pFrom my research Ive read that a BackgroundWorker stops when an unhandled exception is thrown in debug mode. However, Ive ran the project with debug and release configurations, and the behavior is the same. strongEven when in debug mode, the BackgroundWorker stops for a long time without the debugger popping up any exception message.strongp  pAlso note that this bug is difficult to reproduce, as the first SmtpException with message Failure sending mail is thrown when it has sent between 300800 emails, at seemingly random points.p  pFor logging Im just using Trace from System.Diagnostics, so I dont think thats the problem.p  pEDIT I should also add that in some rare occasions, when SmtpException with message Failure sending mail, the BackgroundWorker stops going through the emails completely. I let it hang there just for the hell of it and after 1 hour or so it continued sending emails like nothing happened.p  pHeres the code of DoWorkp  precodeprivate void senderDoWorkobject sender, DoWorkEventArgs e      BackgroundWorker worker  sender as BackgroundWorker     SalaryEmail[] emails  e.Argument as SalaryEmail[]      SmtpClient smtpClient  new SmtpClientsmtp.office365.com, 587     smtpClient.EnableSsl  true     smtpClient.Credentials  new NetworkCredentialSalaryEmail.SmtpCredentials.User, SalaryEmail.SmtpCredentials.Password      foreach SalaryEmail email in emails              if worker.CancellationPending  true                      e.Cancel  true             break                  else                       Sending and database operations here             email.Sendref smtpClient               In this case I only report progress to a progressBar with previously set steps, so the number is irrelevant             worker.ReportProgress0                    smtpClient.Dispose  codepre  pHeres SalaryEmail.Sendp  precodepublic bool Sendref SmtpClient smtpClient      bool sent  false      for int i  0 i lt MAXATTEMPTS i              try                       Mail is a System.Net.Mail.MailMessage nonstatic property created and configured previously within the class             smtpClient.SendMail              sent  true                  catch SmtpException smtpEx                      Trace.WriteLineDateTime.Now   Intento   i   SmtpException   smtpEx.Message                  catch Exception ex                      Trace.WriteLineDateTime.Now   Intento   i   Error al enviar   ex.Message                    Update database         if sent                      try                              Database.MarkAsSentQna, RFC                          catch Exception e                              Trace.WriteLineDateTime.Now   Error al marcar enviados  e.Message                           break                    return sent  codepre  pException detailp  precodeA first chance exception of type System.Net.Mail.SmtpException occurred in System.dll 02012014 125725 Intento 0 SmtpException System.Net.Mail.SmtpException Error al enviar correo. gt System.Net.WebException Se excedi el tiempo de espera de la operacin.    en System.Net.ConnectionPool.GetObject owningObject, Int32 result, Booleanamp continueLoop, WaitHandle[]amp waitHandles    en System.Net.ConnectionPool.GetConnectionObject owningObject, GeneralAsyncDelegate asyncCallback, Int32 creationTimeout    en System.Net.Mail.SmtpConnection.GetConnectionServicePoint servicePoint    en System.Net.Mail.SmtpTransport.GetConnectionServicePoint servicePoint    en System.Net.Mail.SmtpClient.GetConnection    en System.Net.Mail.SmtpClient.SendMailMessage message     Fin del seguimiento de la pila de la excepcin interna     en System.Net.Mail.SmtpClient.SendMailMessage message    en MailingClient.SalaryEmail.SendSmtpClientamp smtpClient en CUsersmriveraDocumentsVisual Studio 2010ProjectsPayrollMailingMailingClientSalaryEmail.cslnea 62 codepre  pTracep  precode02012014 14456 Sending email... 02012014 14501 Updating database... 02012014 14501 Sending email... 02012014 14506 Updating database... 02012014 14507 Sending email... 02012014 14511 Updating database... 02012014 14511 Sending email... ltexception posted above heregt The thread ltNo Namegt 0x1890 has exited with code 0 0x0.

Negative 95875 pOk I know this has been covered a few times and Ive read several post here on encryption algorithms and cryptography methods, etc.  However now my head is spinning and Im still not sure what I need to do.  I have a set of data that is in xml format that I need to save to a file.  p  pIts not terribly sensitive no credit cards or anything but I dont want users to be able to just open it as xml and make edits, etc.  I am not really worried about someone who is programming savvy hacking the format or decompiling to find keys, etc.  p  pWhat I would like is a basic class that I can pass a string value or XmlDocument but you can always call .OuterXml on that and a key that I will hard code and get an encrypted value that I can write to a file.  I would then need to be able to read from a file on a different machine clientcustomer machine and decrypt back to the xml string to be processed by my program.  Again, the keys can be hard coded into the program so that they match in both locations...p  pAlso I dont want to ask the user for a password or anything like that but I can hard code that into the program if necessary as well.p  pCan anyone point me to an easy way to do thisp

Negative 95875 pIn Expect script, how do you prompt user without writing to stdout Is it possible to prompt the user through stderr p  pI have a script written in Perl to automate some testing using ssh.

Negative 95875 pMaybe a mission impossible. Once upon a time I wrote a Ruby module codeSimpleDialogcode for text coloring in DOS windows. It does so by talking to the Windows APIs. Now I want to make it suitable for Mac OS as well, or even for the entire unix universe. Okay, just Terminal and xterm would satisfy my needs for the moment. ANSI escape sequences seem to be the appropriate weapons for the job. But using them I cannot always handle things as I would like to. Here is the functionality I try to realizep  precodedef clearscreen   print e[He[2Jec   color ... old colors stored in an instance variable ...  end codepre  pThe codee[He[2Jcode part is the same as the codeclearcode command thats how Ive found this sequence [edit next day after some experiments codee[2Jcode does not erase any text sent embeforeem the codee[Hcode sequence, even when its visible on the screen]. Terminal and xterm only clear the visible part of the screen strong[issue 1]strong. The codeeccode part doesnt make sense for Terminal anymore, but this time xterm does succeed to clear the entire screen buffer. At doing so, it rings the bell strong[issue 2]strong, while Terminal keeps silent. Since the codeeccode sequence resets the colors, the last settings have to be restored again. Not very elegant, altogether. The codeclearcode command submitted from the command line normally clears the entire screen buffer of xterm. However, it cannot wipe out the part thats left by my attempt to clear the screen by just sending codee[He[2Jcode from Ruby.p  precodedef color ...    ... too big to show here ... end codepre  pThe codecolorcode method works almost fine, theres only one disappointment. In Windows, I can change the color of a rectangle without modifying the text that is already placed within it. I see no way how to do this by ANSI escape sequences strong[issue 3]strong. As a workaround I could memorize the text involved and restore it afterwards, of course. And this one is really puzzling me the respons to codee[6ncode report cursor position is printed to the screen, with the last few  characters repeated after the command prompt. Can it be intercepted by Ruby strong[issue 4]strongp  pThe other methods are a piece of cakep  precodedef shrinkwindow  to its original size   print e[90t end  def stretchwindow  to the maximum size that fits on the screen   print e[91t end  def titletitle  nil   print e]2titlea end  def write... text containing humanfriendly color codes ...   ... trivial ... end codepre  pMSWindows allows me to emgetem the current window title too, but I dont see real use for that xterm doesnt listen at all when the codetitlecode argument is an empty string, btw. The codewritecode method makes use of the codecolorcode method. No problems here. So, in the end, four obstacles to overcome. Or to live withp

Negative 95875 pIm relatively new to Java and Im trying to write a program for my computer programming class that will accept a string from the user the string must be something like 1  2  1 and then take the string, use a delimiter to get rid of the  signs, and then perform the addition and subtraction and return the sum of the string input. To do this, my program has to run through a while loop and each time an integer is found it must perform the appropriate function based on whether a  or  sign preceded the number. Im trying to use .findInLine to have the program determine whether the character is a  or  and then based on this add or subtract the number that follows, but it doesnt seem to work while also using a delimiter and Im stuck as to what to do.

It doesnt return an error or anything, it just freezes. Im not really sure why this is happening. I need the delimiter for the loop and addition to work, and when I tried taking that out it returned an error. I could remove the find in line but then Ill need a different way for the program to determine whether to add or subtract and Im struggling to think of anything. Ive also tried rearranging my code so it will find the  or  sign first, then use a delimiter to get rid of the symbol and proceed with the addition or subtraction, but again the program froze.p  pAny help you can give is much appreciatedp

Negative 95875 pIm trying to create a Grails application that uses Activiti for its process engine. To that end, Id like the main Activiti service classes RuntimeService, TaskService, etc. to be wired as Spring beans.p  pI believe that I have the wiring setup correctly, but when I run a simple integration test that calls the runtime service, I get an error that Spring couldnt open a hibernate session see strongFull Stack Tracestrong, below.p  pstrongUpdatestrong I can start the application with coderunappcode, then call a controller action which calls my service, and it all works. So, the Activiti wiring works, it just has some conflict with the Grails Integration Testing mixin.p  pI really want the Activiti services to use the same datasource connection as the Grails application. Im assuming that the problem is that Activiti is trying to create its own ConnectionHolder instance, when Grails already has one setup for the integration tests.p  pMy specific and possibly misguided question I have is, how do I configure my Activiti ProcessEngine so that it uses the same data source and hibernate connection that my Grails application doesp  pThe more general question is, how can I best make the Activiti services available to my Grails application Ive looked at a hrefhttpsgithub.comlimcheekinactiviti relnofollowthe Activiti plugin for grailsa, and the source of it has helped me get this far.

Negative 95875 pI am working on a program that can encode and then decode text in C.  I am using the stack library.  The way the program works is that it first asks you for a cypher key, which you put in manually.  It then asks for the file name, which is a text file. If it is a normal txt file, it encodes the message to a new file and adds a .iia files extension. If the text file already has a .iia file extension, then it decodes the message, as long as the cypher key is the same as the one used to encode it.  p  pMy program does encode and decode, but how many characters it decodes is determined by codetemp.size  cypher.lengthcode that is in the while loop in the codereadFileEncodecode function.  I think this is what is keeping the entire file from being encoded and then decoded correctly. Another words, the ending file after it has been decoded from say example.txt.iia back to example.txt is missing a large portion of the text from the original example.txt file.  I tried just codecypher.lengthcode but of course that does not encode or decode anything then. The entire process is determined by that argument for the decoding and encoding.  p  pI cannot seem to find out the exact logic for this to encode and decode all the characters in any size file.  Here is the following code for the function that does the decoding and encodingp  pEDIT Using WhozCraigs code that he edited for mep  precodevoid readFileEncodestring fileName, stackltchargt amptext, string cypher      stdifstream filefileName, stdiosinstdiosbinary     stackltchargt temp     char ch      while file.getch         temp.pushch  cypher[temp.size  cypher.length]      while temp.empty              text.pushtemp.top         temp.pop       codepre  pEDIT A stack is required.  I am going to implement my own stack class, but I am trying to get this to work first with the stack library.  Also, if there is a better way of implementing this, please let me know. Otherwise, I believe that there is not much wrong with this except to get it to go through the loop to encode and decode the entire file. I am just unsure as to why it stops at, say 20 characters sometimes, or ten characters. I know it has to do with how long the cypher is too, so I believe it is in the  mod.

Negative 95875 pI am in the process of updating my game to Java, but the only minor bug I have left is thisp  pEvery time a dead players name is added to the dead player name list, it adds the Player objects hashcode instead.p  pEDIT Here is a link to a zip folder with the source code a hrefhttpsdl.dropboxusercontent.comu98444970KarmaSource.zip relnofollowhttpsdl.dropboxusercontent.comu98444970KarmaSource.zipap  pThe code in question is the two places where the line gets the player object and gets the objects name. When it is used in println, it works fine and prints the players name. However, in the second part where it does the same thing, but it prints the hashcode of the player object instead of calling its getname method and returning the String. Im not sure if it has to do with the third part, where it adds the name to dead player list pdead.p  pIf youd like a link to the compiled version, let me know. Its compiled under JDK 7 Update 51 64bit.p  pEDIT I got it working, I was originally referencing the players list instead of the pdead list. Thanks to all who contributed to helping. If you still want the game, let me know and Ill put a download link Dp

Negative 95875 pIm developing a Webpage with ASP.NET and C as code behind.

If true, the GUI will be disabled until the SQL query is finished, then I make another refresh and set isGUIinactive to true, so the GUI will be enabled in another PostBack in the PageLoad  Event.

Negative 95875 pIm developing an app that has iOS 7.1 as its Deployment Target. So far everything works just fine, however there is one huge issue, the tab bar images are not showing up. This is confusing, because they show up when running on the iOS 8 Simulator, Im using the Xcode 6 beta 1.p  pIve set up two images. The dimensions are 60x60 and 70x60. So size does not seem to be an issue. Ive set the images up in Interface Builder. When logging the tab bar image to the console however, it returns nil. Ive then tried setting the images up in code, and using the same method to log it to the console, I now have a memory address for the image, but it still does not show up.p  pWhen searching for an answer on Google and stackoverflow, Ive found this methodp  precode        self.tabBarItem.image  [[UIImage imageNamedIMAGE] imageWithRenderingModeUIImageRenderingModeAlwaysOriginal] self.tabBarItem.selectedImage  [[UIImage imageNamedIMAGE] imageWithRenderingModeUIImageRenderingModeAlwaysOriginal] NSLog, self.tabBarItem.image codepre  pThis worked for some users apparently, but not for me.

Negative 95875 pThis question is related to diagraming a software process. As an electrical engineer, much of the software I do is for embedded microcontrollers. In school, we learned to illustrate our algorithm using a flowchart. However, nowadays, many of my embedded projects are heavily interruptdriven where the main process runs some basic algorithm a variety of interrupt sources provide its stimulus. So, my question is, what are some diagramming techniques that I can use to illustrate my process such that future developers can understand what I am doing easily and get involved in developmentp  pHere are some key features that I am looking forp  ul liShows data structures and how data is passed between processes amp interruptsli liShows conditions that cause each interruptli liShows how data is gathered and passed through a downlinkli liShows how command messages are received, parsed, and executedli liIdeally is well suited for hierarchical breakdown into smaller processes with greater levels of detailli ul

Negative 95875 pI encountered this phenomenon in a mature application that I work on where the Tahoma font in WPF is much faster than Arial. p  pI built a test application to verify what I was seeing. p  pThe test application has a TabControl with several TabItems. Each tab contains a DataGrid control and is populated with 18 columns. The gridscolumns are all databound to the same viewmodel. The only difference whatsoever between the tabs are the fonts used. There are 1000 rows. The TextBlock sizes are fixed to the same sizes across the board.p  pWhen I attempt to drag the vertical scrollbar handle and vertically scroll, the performance varies dramatically between the Tahoma and Arial tabs. You know how a scrollbar handle lags behind where your mouse is while the drawing catches up, and each time it finishes drawing a screen, it immediately realizes you have already scrolled an entire screen or more futher, so it completely has to redraw again With Tahoma, this happens pretty fast, tick tick tick tick tick. Its not smooth scrolling by any means, but it is usable. With Arial, its more like, tick..........tick..........tick..........tick. Very noticable difference. Id say it takes about 23 times as long per tick.p  pIve played around with TextOptions.TextFormattingMode, TextOptions.TextRenderingMode, and Typography.NumeralAlignment, but the difference in performance remains. p  pAny ideas why this might be happening, and more importantly, if there are any pertinent settings that might alleviate the differencep

Negative 95875 pI am using Linux Mint, Apache ANT and a command line.p  pI am trying to write a game using LWJGL and am also developing a personal utility library at the same time.

Negative 95875 pI have a networked game where I am constantly looping over a game object dictionary to call one function on them, for example draw or sendlocation or get location. I am looking for a way to improve it. I would like to be able to call a function, that accepts a function as an argument, and that function is then called on each game object.

Negative 95875 pI have a parent class codeResultcode that uses single table inheritance to define multiple result types. Each result type has a method codecalculatecode which calculates the result, and it depends on other results to be calculated before.p  pIve modeled this dependency with a fancy class method like sop  precodeclass Result lt ActiveRecordBase    def calculate     raise calculate is abstract. Implement this method in one of the subclasses.   end    def self.dependsonargs        get the dependent result, and calculate it if necessary       definemethodarg.tos.underscore do         results  measurement.results.wheretype arg.tos.limit1         result  results.first if results.any         result.calculate if result.value.nil         result       end     end   end     ... end codepre  pSo I can define, for example, my codeFoocode result which depends on codeBarcodep  precodeclass Foo lt Result    dependson Bar    def calculate      do something with bar     self.value  bar     self.save   end  end codepre  pNow I would like to add an attribute called codeversioncode to each result, which specifies the implementation version of the calculation. For example, I might later update the way a result is calculated and then update its version. I know I could simply do codeself.version  0.1code before saving, but what I would rather have is something like thisp  precodeclass Foo lt Result   dependson Bar   version 1.0    def calculate     ... codepre  pI know I can define codedef self.versionargcode in the parent class codeResultcode, but given that it is a class method, I dont have a way of interacting with the object at runtime.p  pSo, how would I implement thatp

Negative 95875 pI am using an Apache 2.4 server with modproxy as an HTTP reverse proxy for Tomcat server. The reverse proxy works on a SplitDNS configuration where server.com might point either to the actual HTTP server or to my reverse proxy depending on where the client is. p  pThe problem that Im having is that our client application had a problem where sometimes it would include an header more than once. For example, an HTTP request could end up looking like thisp  precodePOST server.com HTTP1.1 SomeHeader foo Authorization BASIC abc123 Authorization BASIC abc123 OtherHeaders ... codepre  pThis works fine if the client is talking directly to Tomcat but if it goes through the reverse proxy then the duplicated headers seem to get mangled and Tomcat ends up receiving a request that looks like thisp  precodePOST server.com HTTP1.1 SomeHeader foo Authorization BASIC abc123, BASIC abc123 OtherHeaders ... codepre  pI used Wireshark to inspect the HTTP requests as they are sentreceived in the ClientProxyTomcat chain and Apache is definitely the component that is collapsing the two headers into one.p  pIs there a way to configure this behavior in a way where it either sends both headers or just one What I dont want is this collapsing taking place...p

Negative 95875 pIm quite newbie in angular and just learning it. p  pSo now I am thinking about organizing my code. Ive read a hrefhttphenriquat.remodularizingangularjsmodularizingangularapplicationsmodularizingangularapplications.html relnofollowthisa and a hrefhttpsblog.safaribooksonline.com2014032713stepguideangularjsmodularization relnofollowthisa and the main idea which the authors express is to structure code by functionality by modules but not by types controller, services etc.p  pOk, I said to myself and started writing modules. However I came across one serious problem  postponed delayed module registration. As I use requirejs I am not talking about lazy loading, as all scripts are loaded lazily. p  pWhat I mean  lets suppose that the index page was loaded, angular bootstrapped and page was compiled. After that the user opens page N which has its own module. So we need to register this module in application. But as I understand we cant do it after bootstrap. On the other hand if the our spaapplication is large we cant always register all modules. p  pI found solutions how to register other components but not modules a hrefhttpify.iolazyloadinginangularjs relnofollowherea and a hrefhttpwww.slideshare.netnirkaufmanangularjslazyloadingtechniques relnofollowherea and some talks what it would be fine to register modules at runtime a hrefhttpsgroups.google.comforumtopicangularw0ZEBz02l8s relnofollowherea. Also I found some solution a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma191342062022068herea how to register modules after bootstap but it seems to be a hack.p  pSo my questions p  ol liif I develop a large application should I structure my code by types controllers,services but not by modules, register them after bootstrapping as its impossible in current versions of angular register modules after bootstrap I mean to do aonly one moduleapplication.li liis it possible to unregister controllers,services etc at runtimeli ol

Negative 95875 pIm currently working on a project that requires splitting sentences in order to compare two words a given word which the user needs to type, giving us the second to each other, and check the accuracy of the users typing. Ive been using codex.split code to do this, however, this is causing me an issue.p  pLets say the given sentence was codeThe quick brown foxcode, and the user types in codeThe quick  brown foxcode. Instead of returning code[The,quick , brown, fox]code, its returning code[The, quick, , brown, fox]code. This makes it harder to check for accuracy, as Id like it to be checked word per word.p  pIn other words, Id like to append any extra spaces to the word that came before, but the codesplitcode function is creating separate empty elements instead. How do I go about removing any empty entries and adding them to the word that came before them p  pId like this to work for lists where there are multiple codecode entries in a row as well, such as code[The, quick, , , brown, fox]code.p  pThanksp  pEDIT  The code Im using to test this is just some variation of codex  The quick brown fox.split code, with different whitespaces.p  pEDIT 2  I didnt think about this thanks Malonge, but if the sentence starts with a space, I would actually like that to be counted as well. I dont know how easy that would be, since Id need to make this particular instance an exception where the whitespace needs to be appended to the word that follows rather than the one that precedes it. However, Ill make a conscious choice to ignore that scenario when calculating accuracy due to the difficulty in implementing it.p

Negative 95875 pI was checking here many questions regarding a InsertOrUpdatePossibility. But all had one Id as a primary key. In my DBTable I have a composite primary key and need to avoid possible duplicates. In C I can check for an entity with same Id and in that case make an update otherwise make an Add. Having a new entity created in C then there is no Id but the possibility that the composite primary key is already used in DB. Hence using an DBcreated Id is not useful. Either way there is a composite primary key in DB and in C I need to use Find with this composite primary in order to avoid duplicates. But the composite key is different depending on each entitytype.p  pIve seen that emModel1.EDMXem has a tag emKeyem containing all parts of the primary key.

Negative 95875 pI recently published android app in play store and it appeared alright. I just want to change my Feature Graphics image in Store listing section. Changing the image enables the button Submit Update. My question isp  ol lipIf I change only image assets in store listing and click Submit Update, would this send app update notification to the current users, even if I didnt change the APK filepli lipI read in documentation that one must update the versionCode property in manifest file before Submitting the updates. I guess this only applies when we actually change the APK file. Do I have to increment the versionCode too in my APK file even if I am only changing the Feature Graphics image displayed in Play Store only.pli lipIs it okay to change image assets in store listing like this after the app has been publishedpli ol  pMany thanksp

Negative 95875 pI am coding a Pacman clone. The steps that I have accomplished are the floor, the maze, as also the pacman and the movement of pacman through wall paths.p  pThe maze is in array format where the walls are represented as codexcode. Also the movement should go with codewasdcode keys from the keyboard.

Is there any betternicer way I can write thisp  pstrongUpdatestrong I do realize that this looks like pretty strange behavior so I am going to explain a bit more.p  pThis example is of angular routes and my custom middleware to handle authentication. p  pSo I have created three route handlers p  ul licustomRouteli lionlyGuestli lionlyUserli ul  pso instead of writing p  precoderouteProvider.route codepre  pI write for examplep  precoderouteProvider.customRoute codepre  pNow each of those special route handlers extends emresolveem attribute of route with the authentication. p  pThat way I can do this for examplep  precoderootScope.onrouteChangeError,functione, current, previous, rejection          Only for logged in users         if rejection ampamp rejection.needsAuthentication             rootScope.refUrl  location.path             location.pathuserlogin                    Only for nonlogged in users         if rejection ampamp rejection.isOnlyGuest             rootScope.refUrl  location.path             location.pathdashboard               codepre  pNow the onlyGuest and onlyUser should be clear enough, but I also have customRoute which basically runs the authentication method simply to retrieve user info if user accesses the app directly through this url and can be guest as well as can be logged in. p  pThe problem is that when the authentication method throws reject the route automatically fires changeError. So for this customRoute I need to run the authentication but not go to changeError  always resolve as true even if authentication promise rejects.p  pNot sure if its any clearer or just got more complicated...p

Negative 95875 pI have a tool that will list failed tests, and I would like a way to open a fully qualified class and goto a method in Eclipse with a single string I can copy from the results.

Negative 95875 pIm planning to write a small application for applying various filters to an image like Gaussian Blur, Contrast, Saturation, .... The size of these images is at least 24 megapixels. p  pMy plan is to upload the image to the video card and do every change to the image there using GL shaders. After editing is completed i would also like of course to store the modified image to disk.p  pI see the following problemsp  ul liThe image size might be NPOT li liThe image size might be too large to fit into video memory as one piece maybe use tilingli ul  pFurther questions arep  ul liIf tiling is used, how should i stitch the tiles together again when saving. Will there be some kind of loss of qualityli liHow can i reach maximum quality In the ideal case loading and immediately saving should result in the same image.li liHow can i implement a live preview, meaning like i pull the slider and the image updates, after clicking ok the changes are applied, on cancel nothing should happen to the original imageli liIs it a good idea to apply the shader to a new working copy texture with the original texture as input and use this texture then as source for subsequent editsli liIn the future there should be layers support, what would be the best way to implement this Just layer all textures on top and apply blend modesli ul  pThis is more or less a question about architecting an image editor which does everything with GL shaders. Maybe you can give me some pointers or caveats.p
Negative 95875 pI wrote a Java program for a hrefhttpsprojecteuler.netproblem35 relnofollowProject Euler 35 Circular Primesap  blockquote   pThe number, 197, is called a circular prime because all rotations of   the digits 197, 971, and 719, are themselves prime.p      pThere are thirteen such primes below 100 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 31,   37, 71, 73, 79, and 97.p      pHow many circular primes are there below one millionp blockquote  pMy code compiles and runs fine, however, it gives different results depending on the data structure I use.p  pThe algorithm works like thisp  ol lipGet precalculated primes. This is the call to codeMathUtils.getPrimes1000000code, which gets all primes equal to or less than a million. I store this in another codeSetcode because it is implemented by returning a subset, and performance is ridiculously terrible unless I copy the primes into their own data structure.pli lipWhile the set of primes is not empty, get the next prime.pli lipGet all rotations of that prime. E.g. 197, 971, 719. These rotations need not be prime themselves, because I need to verify them anyway.pli lipIf the prime set contains all of the rotations, add the count of the rotations to a running total.pli lipRemove all of the rotations from the set of primes if they exist.pli ol  pI noticed two weird things about this code. If I use a codeTreeSetcode to store the primes the performance is very fast and it produces correct resultsp  blockquote   pAnswer 55br   Time 76msp blockquote  pIf I switch to a codeHashSetcode the performance is a lot worse emand the results are incorrectem.p  blockquote   pAnswer 50br   Time 2527msp blockquote  pI put code at the top to double check that the sets both contain the same values before the code runs, and they always do.p  ol lipWhy does using the codeHashSetcode produce incorrect results as compared to the codeTreeSetcode There are no nulls or other weird values, only positive, distinct codeIntegercode instances. The sets start out containing the exact same data. The algorithm is the same, because it is the exact same code. Due to ordering differences between the implementations and the size of the data, it is nigh impossible to compare the state of the algorithms as they are running. If I reduce the input size, the two produce the same results up to 100,000.pli lipWhy does the codeTreeSetcode perform so much faster than the codeHashSetcode, when it has to perform all of those removals and tree rotations that are not applicable to a codeHashSetcode Looking at the code for codeHashMapcode which backs codeHashSetcode, there is no resizing or shuffling of contents going on other than that localized to a specific bin. Furthermore, the primes are fairly evenly distributed. While there is no easy way to validate, I would expect that there would not be the worstcase performance issue of many items occupying a small number of bins in the table.pli ol  pCode follows.

Negative 95875 pIm trying to make a chat application using GCM, but Im a little confused about what the best practices are. p  pThe tutorials Ive seen recommend using the XMPPprotocol because you can use existing connections and pass bidirectional messages which makes it faster. The problem is that the GCM payload is limited to 4kb. I wonder whether its safer to use the push notifications to actually deliver the messages or just to notify the clients that there more messages to download using the HTTPprotocol. p  pThere is also the security problem. I use the OAuth resource owner flow to secure many of HTTPendpoints. It feels bad to also include the clientid, userid and accesstokenrefreshtoken in my GCM upstream messages since the payload is already limited. Also, it would require me to write a lot of code ensuring that the accesstoken has not expired and when to retry and include a refreshtoken instead and so on.  So I wonder if its better to just send the upstream messages using the HTTPprotocol and then using GCM to notify the receiver to download the message.  Lastly, I wonder if its worth using the XMPPprotocol if you are using HTTP for upstream messages anyway. Is the XMPPprotocol still faster, or is it just faster if you are going to use it to send upstreammessagesp  pHope I was able to explain my problem well.p

Negative 95875 pThis topic has been discussed before, however I was unable to find anything applicable.p  pI have a large number of datasets numbering in the thousands, which Id like to display and then run through a JS pagination.p  pThat obviously requires me to fetch all the results, which just takes a few milliseconds and is barely noticeable.p  pHowever upon constructing the actual page, the images, which are largely recurring, lead to a page loading time of 10 seconds, which is decidedly too long.p  pMy question is fairly simple Is there some way to tell the browser to download each picture just once and reuse that instead of apparently downloading the same pictures over and over againp  pOr do you know any other tricks to speed up page loading for many datasets with recurring picturesp  pId like to avoid having to do the pagination via AJAX if possible.p  pMy table structure looks like thisp  precodelttablegt     lttrgt         lttdgtNumberlttdgt         lttdgtImagelttdgt         lttdgtImagelttdgt         lttdgtTextlttdgt         lttdgtTextlttdgt         lttdgtTextlttdgt         lttdgtTextlttdgt         lttdgtImagelttdgt         lttdgtTextlttdgt         lttdgtImagelttdgt         lttdgtImagelttdgt     lttrgt lttablegt codepre  pThe last image is the same for all rows, for images one and two its always one of two different images, four is one of 13 different images.p  pI hope you can help me out a little.p  pEdit Thanks to the previous replies, I managed to get rid of the image loading times, which is per definition great, however it didnt really reduce my loading times all that much.p  pFirebug tells me, that it wastes most of the time on codeWaitingcode, which gives me an entirely new angle on the problem I can explore.p  pThanks for helping out so far, if I get stuck again, Ill open a new question. p  pOn a final note, it appears the problem wasnt the serverclient transfer connection, but much rather my Firefox is having issues rendering the large block.

So it shouldnt be running the codevalidatesassociatedcode. These are also created parents, so there shouldnt be a codecreatecode or codenewrecordcode in play. Another debug statement proves that validations are running on contact, including the one for phonenumber, but only the second time it gets called in an action.p  pI also put in a breakpoint and could see that codeparent.validcode returned true and then false, and also that if I break before codevalidcode gets called and call codeparent.contactdetailcode and then codeparent.validcode then it returns false.p  pWhy is the second call to codeparent.validcode validating codecontactcode even though its only supposed to do that codeon createcodep

Negative 95875 pI have a site where the permalinks are already setup and working fine in the format a hrefhttpdomainpostname relnofollowhttpdomainpostnamea, I want to move them to a hrefhttpdomainblogpostname relnofollowhttpdomainblogpostnamea. Everything is done in the IIS rewrite module. I am assuming I need to first make a redirect rule from a hrefhttpdomainpostname relnofollowhttpdomainpostnamea to a hrefhttpdomainblogpostname relnofollowhttpdomainblogpostnamea and then tweak the permalink rewrite rule to make it work with the new a hrefhttpdomainblogpostname relnofollowhttpdomainblogpostnamea format although I am not sure if that is needed if I update the permalink settings in wordpress to a custom format that has the blog in the path. The first problem I am having is that the redirect is not working correctly, it redirects but doesnt put the blog in front of the postname like I am expecting. Here are the rules in the web.configp  precode        ltrule namewordpress stopProcessingtruegt             ltmatch urlblog negatetrue gt                 ltconditionsgt                     ltadd inputREQUESTFILENAME matchTypeIsFile negatetruegt                     ltadd inputREQUESTFILENAME matchTypeIsDirectory negatetruegt                 ltconditionsgt             ltaction typeRedirect urlblogR1 redirectTypePermanent gt         ltrulegt         ltrule namewordpress2 patternSyntaxWildcardgt             ltmatch urlgt                 ltconditionsgt                     ltadd inputREQUESTFILENAME matchTypeIsFile negatetruegt                     ltadd inputREQUESTFILENAME matchTypeIsDirectory negatetruegt                 ltconditionsgt             ltaction typeRewrite urlindex.phpgt         ltrulegt codepre  pAlso, if I need to tweak the second rule I am not sure what needs to change to make it continue to work or if I just need to update the permalink settings in wordpress. I am fairly new to wordpress and my knowledge of the rewrite module is enough to be dangerous. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I have been looking for an example of this, but have had a difficult time finding one. Thanks in advance.p

Negative 95875 pIm hoping someone can shed some light on this concept for me. I need to create a function that takes a grayscale image in a numpy array as an argument and iterates through it pixel by pixel. In the past, I have used np.nditerimage for this. I need to return an image in a numpy array similar to this picture.p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comQHflo.jpg relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comQHflo.jpg altenter image description hereap  pIn order to differentiate the image in the X direction, I need to use Fx, y  Fx1, y  Fx, yp  pAs you can see, I need to go column by column while Y remains the same. How would I go about incorporating that into the np.nditer I should note that I have to iterate, I cant vectorize for this. Also the output will have a width one less than the original since no calculation can be done once the last column is reached.p  pAny help is much appreciatedp

Negative 95875 pI am stuck and need some help with organizing my code. The idea is to have jQuery looping 5 select elements. Each select element should have only one answer  selected user answer which is not multiple. As there are 5 select elements, there should be 5 correct answers. I created an array to store the object of correct answers and use it in the loop. It is important to keep the order of the elements  e.g. E flat should be accepted as a correct answer only in select element note1, C sharp  in note2 and so on. I have created a working solution for each correct answer and a separate select element e.g. note1 etc but now I try to make this code dryer in order to avoid copying it several times e.g. 5 and changing only criteria of the correct answer and select element. There is something wrong with my logic. Probably I have to use another array of select elements e.g. [note1, note2, note3, note4, note5] and loop through select elements AND options inside them at the same time. Unfortunately it makes things worse as the number of errors just gets multiplied by 5.  There is something wrong with the way how I iterate through the elements.
