Negative 279 pI have a problem that I am not sure how to solve. I have a DataGridView codeEditMode  EditProgrammaticallycode. This grid has one checkbox column and one or more textbox columns.

The problem is when you press space and a checkbox cell is active. When a textbox cell is active, it works like it should. The problem is that when you press space and a checkbox cell is active, both events gets fired. Which means it first selects and then deselects or the reverse. So the checkboxes end up being like they was. How can I prevent thisp  pI have thought about using a flag, but not sure where I can put it, since I cant really know if it was a double event or if it was just the user using space and then clicking with the mouse.

Is there a different event I should use Is there a way to see if the cell was clicked by mouse or by space Is there a way to disable the automatic checkbox toggling when space is pressed What can I dop  hr  pstrongNotestrong Reason for RowSelectorFormKeyDown and not just gridKeyDown was that I was trying to use KeyPreview and then suppress the keypress if it was space and the grid was focused.

Negative 279 pHere is my current situationp  pI have a web page containing a couple scrollable divs. Each of those divs contains a number of objects. I am using YUI to display popup menus of actions that can be performed on each object. Each object has its own menu associated with it that is constructed and displayed dynamically. The popup menus can be large and can overlap the bounds of the scrollable div.p  pFrom what I believe are issues with focus the menus must be accessible, when I hover the mouse over an action that lies on top of an edge of the scrollable div, the div automatically scrolls, moving the content but leaving the menu stationary. Trying to move the menu dynamically when this happens is not something I want to do as I believe it would provide a poor user experience.p  pSo I need to prevent this focussed menu from scrolling the div. My idea for providing the best user interface is to prevent these inner divs from scrolling when a menu is open. This leaves the menu positioned in the optimal location to show the user which item is being acted upon. If the user wants to scroll the box, they can click to close the menu and then scroll normally.p  pHow can I do this I need a solution that works across the major browsers.p  pMy first thought was to listen to the emonscrollem event for that particular element. Unfortunately, there does not seem to be an easy way from there to just prevent the scrolling from happening. For one, my Javascript event code appears to execute after the actual scrolling has occurred.p  pThen, I thought that since my code is being run after the object has scrolled, I could just reset strongobj.scrollTopstrong and strongobj.scrollLeftstrong. Sure enough, this appears to work, though I am worried that on slow browsers the user will see the content inside the div jump around. Also, it would be really nice if the amount the element scrolls is part of the event object. Is it stuck in there somewhere  Im looking for an alternative to having to store the scrollTop and scrollLeft variables for this element and then using them while the scrolling is temporarily disabled.p  pWhat is the best way to solve this entire problemp

I find out if team gets eliminated or not. Now I also want to simulate this.

User will be able to play and stop animation. I also want to show changes in flow in all edges and things like that. So far, I have algorithm working but I dont know how to approach simulation. Should I be using separate thread for simulation execution Should I write separate class that would be executed as algorithm but with states recording without even knowing for real algorithm because I dont want to interrupt performance of real algorithm. Should I use current algorithm and add some lines in between for saving execution states in some data structures that I could use later for displaying simulation to user Any ideas might help..p

Negative 279 pI need some help Please. I am trying to develop a very very simple application, basically just a simple book reader. Ideally, the first view would be a uitableview listing the names of chapters, then selecting the row would take you to a detail view that has the chapter which is broken up into segments. Note the segments are actually their own records inside of the table. So I am trying to populate a uitext view with multiple records from a db table. The process of getting all of my data from this db is where Im just getting all messed up. I searched around on the internet for some tutorials and I found a very useful one a hrefhttpjainmarket.blogspot.com200905iphonesdktutorialreadingdatafrom.html relnofollowherea. I went through it step by step, and it made sense, it was all making sense. But instead of using the db he provided, I wanted to try inserting my own db, that has all of the content Id like to have viewable, and it wont work. Its throwing a nice code Terminating app due to uncaught exception NSInvalidArgumentException, reason  [NSString stringWithUTF8String] NULL cStringcode error that I cant figure out.

I changed the select  from animals statement to select  from books where animals was the name of the old table, and books is the name of the table in the new db I would like to use. I thought that wouldnt be too big of a deal, but apparently it is. I recognize that this is not a very tidy question, but if there is anyone out there that could help me over this wall I am facing, it would be greatly appreciated. Thanksp

Negative 279 pOk I have a table in my SQL Server database that stores comments. My desire is to be able to page though the records using [Back],[Next], page numbers amp [Last] buttons in my data list.

Negative 279 pI have a reporting module C asp.net that uses dynamic controls to represent the varying parameters of the selected reports.p  pThe dynamic controls build and display fine XML stored in SQL Server 2008 and XSLT for the transform into HTML.p  pMy problem is that I have a drop down listnot dynamically created that contains the report names as text and the report ids as the value. This DDL posts back when its selected index changes. When the DDL posts back, a session and viewstate variable containing the selected report id is populated. I want to read this variable and use it to generate the dynamic parameter controls.

Negative 279 pWere currently using System.Decimals to represent numbers in a .NET application were developing. I know that decimals are design to minimize errors due to rounding, but I also know that certain numbers, 13 for example, cannot be represented as a decimal so some calculations will have small rounding error. I believe the magnitude of this error will be very small and insignificant, however a colleague disagrees. I would therefore like to be able to estimate the order of magnitude of the error due to rounding in our app. Say, for example, we are calculating a running total of deals and will do about 10,000 deals per day and there are about 510 decimal operations add, sub, div, mul etc. to calculate the running total new running total for each deal received, what would be the order of magnate of round error An answer with a procedure for calculating this would also be nice, so I can learn how to do this for myself in the future.p

This means zero or more of the previous term, concatenated together.li liThe codecode plus character represents a convenient shortcut codeacode is equivalent to codeaacode, meaning one or more of the previous term.li liThe codecode question mark character represents zero or one of the previous term.li liThe codecode pipe character represents an alternation, meaning that the REGULAR EXPRESSIONS on either side can be used in the match.li liAll other characters are assumed to be literal. You may assume that all other characters are within code[09AZaz]code i.e., all English alphanumerics.li ul  pOr, put another way codecodecodecodecodecode have highest precedence, then concatenation, then alternation. Since alternation has lower precedence than concatenation, its use within a regex without parentheses causes it to be bound to the full regex on each side. codecode and codecode and codecode, on the other hand, would just apply to the immediately preceding term.p  h3The challengeh3  pYour challenge is to write a program that will compile or interpret a regular expression as defined above and then test a number of strings against it.p  pIm leaving input up to you. My recommendation would be that the regex should probably come first, and then any number of strings to be tested against it but if you want to make it last, thats fine. If you want to put everything in commandline arguments or into stdin, or the regex in commandline and the strings in stdin, or whatever, thats fine. Just show a usage example or two.p  pOutput should be codetruecode or codefalsecode, one per line, to reflect whether or not the regex matches.p  pbNotesbp  ul liI shouldnt need to say this... but dont use any regex libraries in your language You need to compile or interpret the pattern yourself. bEditb You may use regex if its required for splitting or joining strings. You just cant use it to directly solve the problem, e.g., converting the input regex into a language regex and using that.li liThe regular expression must COMPLETELY match the input string for this challenge. Equivalently, if youre familiar with Perllike regex, assume that start and endofstring anchoring is in place for all matchesli liFor this challenge, all of the special characters codecode are not expected to occur literally. If one comes up in the input, it is safe to assume that no pattern can match the string in question.li liInput strings to test should be evaluated in a casesensitive manner.li ul  h3The examplesh3  pFor the examples, Im assuming everything is done in commandline arguments, regex first. As I said above, input is up to you. codemyregexcode here represents your invocation of the program.p  precodegt myregex easy easy Easy hard true false false  gt myregex aba aa abba abab b true true false false  gt myregex 0110 1 10 0110 00001 true true false true  gt myregex 0110 1 10 0110 00001 true true true true  gt myregex ababba abb babab aaa aabba a b true true false true false true codepre  pbNOTEb Sorry, forgot to make community wiki p

Negative 279 pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pDetection of hash change in the URL and fixing the forwardback button are two requirements for libraries that deal with Ajax history. Theres two schools of thought for implementing these libraries. You can have a poller constantly check the URL bad browsers dont have the onHashChange event. Or you can use a hidden iFrame to add points in your browser history. One may think the hidden iFrame is better than polling, but the hidden iFrame does not update the outer browsers URL. So if a user wanted to share her current state in the web application, she would always be sharing her initial state. p  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pIs there any technique for Ajax history that both doesnt require polling and also updates the main browsers URLp

Negative 279 pI authored a Firefox addon several months ago that recently failed. The addon basically looks for a particular URL and then modifies the DOM for the page.  I traced the failure to the accidental installation of the AVG Safe Search addon.  I found that, with the AVG addon disabled, the DOMContentLoaded event fires once for the document behavior I originally expected, but with it enabled, the DOMContentLoaded event fires twice for the document.  My addon inserts a column into an HTML table, so because the event fires twice, two duplicate columns are inserted rather than one.p  pHeres the distilled initialization code of my addonp  precodevar hLoadListener  functionevent  myAddon.initializeevent  var hContentLoadedListener  functionevent  myAddon.onContentLoadedevent   myAddon.initialize  functionaEvent      gBrowser.addEventListenerDOMContentLoaded, hContentLoadedListener, false   myAddon.onContentLoaded  functionaEvent      if aEvent.originalTarget.nodeName  document  return       var doc  aEvent.target  document that triggered onload event      if doc instanceof HTMLDocument  return      if doc.location  return       var href  doc.location.href  URL of current page      if URLRegExp.testhref             Modify the pages DOM        window.addEventListenerload, hLoadListener, false codepre  pThis issue seems easy to fix by inserting a unique DOM element and then testing for its existence at the start. My question is whether addon developers should expect this event behavior as normal or whether this issue is primarily a bugsideeffect in the AVG addonp

Negative 279 pI have to determine whether a language for example Lan bm cs  0ltnltmlts is regular, contextfree, recursive, recursively enumerable or none of them.p  pI know how to determine if a language is regular find a DFA or regular expression that works or contextfree find a PDA or contextfree grammar that works I know that a recursive language has a Turing machine that always halts and that a recursively enumerable language has a Turing machine that may not halt. p  pSo the question is is there a fast criteria to determine whether the language is recursive or recursively enumerable or neither For example, I dont have to build a PDA to understand that a language is contextfree, I cant see it by the fact that it requires one stack is there a similar fast approach to the problem that hopefully saves the trouble to build a Turing machinep
Negative 279 pIm using a script to call growlnotify to display some time tracking data current project name, time elapsed, a list of available projects together with time spent on them on the current day and keyboards shortcuts to switch between projects.p  pI would like to do some styling of the text some text bold, some text italic, some in a different colour. I understand its possible to create custom styles for the container of the growl notification via CSS, but that customizes the layout not the content. p  pCan I also style the text, just some basic stuff It would be perfect to be able to use inline HTML, but that sounds too good to be true. Maybe its possible to add some placeholders to my custom Growl style so in stead of just title and text I would also have projectname and elapsed or something.. maybe pass those arguments to growlnotify p  pThank you in advance p

Negative 279 pI have a challenge which I cant find answers to through any normal means. I want to do as much as possible in a single query because my only other alternative is to script this function and foreach loop it with countless subqueries.p  pOk, so I have a logging table on an MySQL server, it has the following columns     Key, UserID, datetime and position Position can be start, login and end.p  pI want to find out the difference between start, login and end for each login event. Anyone have an idea of an SQL query I could use I think it has something to do with a query within a query but I can only find JOINsp  pI postulate that I would first SELECT the start events and then for each start event it should look for the next first login event for the UserID after the time of the start but less than the time of the next start for the same UserID then DATESUB to find out the difference. It would be important to filter out login or end events that happen after a future start event in case either didnt happen.p  pI would be very grateful if anyone could save me doing this in Excel because then I can avoid feeling too dirty with thousands of vlookups. Im contemplating doing this in PHP or Perl and just creating a loop with LIMIT 1 SQL statements, but that could create thousands of SQL queries compared to a single decent SQL SELECT statement.p

Ive been asked to develop a web application using ASP.NET that can accesssynthesize information from these and display it in one location. Unfortunately, one of the websites does not support OAuth or anything similar, so I need to store their login credentials in a database.p  pMy first thought was to use their credentials for my site as a key to encrypt their credentials for the remote site. For example Bob logs in to my website with the password hunter2. Using that password, I decrypt Bobs credentials for www.example.com and log in as Bob there.

When it is in an international formating the query gets an error when run and fails. the query isp  precode        SELECT DISTINCT AlarmDet.Machine, AlarmDet.Job,  AlarmDet.Mode, AlarmDet.User, AlarmDet.JobStart,  AlarmDet.Object, AlarmDet.AlarmId, AlarmDet.AlarmStart,  AlarmDet.MachineFault, AlarmDet.OperFault,      AlarmDet.PiecesFed, ValOperFaultValMachineFault AS AlarmStopTime,      Midalarmdet.AlarmStart,5,7 amp Rightalarmdet.AlarmStart,4 amp Midalarmdet.AlarmStart,11,9 AS AlarmTimeDate,      Midalarmdet.AlarmStart,12,2 AS AlarmHH,      Midalarmdet.AlarmStart,15,2 AS AlarmMM,  Midalarmdet.AlarmStart,18,2 AS AlarmSS,  CVDateMid[alarmdet].[AlarmStart],5,7 amp Right[alarmdet].[AlarmStart],4 AS AlarmDate, Alarms.ALARMDESC     FROM AlarmDet INNER JOIN Alarms ON AlarmDet.AlarmId  Alarms.id codepre  pWhat the formulas in the query are doing is taking alarmstart date and splitting it up into seperate segments.p  pThe section of the query that is causing an error when i step into it and attempt to run it is thisp  precodeCVDateMid[alarmdet].[AlarmStart],5,7 amp Right[alarmdet].[AlarmStart],4 AS AlarmDate codepre  pWhat i would like to know is, if there is a way in access to convert the formating of the query to be turnned in to US dateformating Or is there a better way to structure this part of the query in order to get it to run under an international formatingp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pafter spending some time and trying some of your suggestions, ive come up with thisp  precodeformatMid[alarmdet].[AlarmStart],5,7 amp right[alarmdet][alarmstart], 4, mmddyyyy codepre  pHowever, instead of getting mmddyyyy, i get this mmddyyyy.p  pAny thoughts as to why that isp  pstrongUpdate again...strongp  pNevermind, it appears that, that has to do with where your locale is set to.p  pAny suggestions or help is greatly appreciated.p  pThanks.p

Negative 279 pI am setting up a mining calculator for a game called eve.p  pIn my calculator you can select from a list of players and then from a list of ore.p  pAs you select a player or ore, a toggle event is used in jquery to signal to the player that heshe has selected the item.  In addition an ajax call to a php script is fired to adddelete memberore from a database.p  pThe issue I have is that although when the mining op is loaded that has previously been worked on has already had membersore added to it the toggle events for the playerore are still set as if it has not been selected.  I already have php code in place that prevents adding duplicate players and ore but I would like the interface to show to the user that a player or ore has previously been selected.  Additionally as the player  ore has already been selected in a previous session, I would like the first action of the toggle event to be the one that would be used to unhighlight the selection and remove the ore.p  pEvery ore that is part of the op that is stored in the db is returned with a rel tag with its typeId  Below is a sample of what the player list looks likep  precodeltdiv classminingMemberListgt     ltdiv classfloat stylecolor whitesmokegt         ltinput typecheckbox classcbox nameoption1 value90892149 styledisplay none gtGlitch Rin     ltdivgt     ltdiv classfloat stylecolor whitesmokegt         ltinput typecheckbox classcbox nameoption1 value1162532926 styledisplay none gtDrake Firerain     ltdivgt     ltdiv classspacergt     ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pBelow is a sample of what the ore list looks likep  precodeltdiv classoreList styledisplay block gt     ltdiv classopOre typeid17428gt         Triclinic Bistotltimg classimgopOre srchttpimage.eveonline.comType1742832.png altTriclinic Bistotgt     ltdivgt     ltdiv classopOre typeid17429gt         Monoclinic Bistotltimg classimgopOre srchttpimage.eveonline.comType1742932.png altMonoclinic Bistotgt     ltdivgt     ltdiv classopOre typeid1227 stylebackgroundcolor rgb57, 57, 57 color rgb245, 245, 245 gt         Omberltimg classimgopOre srchttpimage.eveonline.comType122732.png altOmbergt     ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pBelow is a sample of the returned data from the ajax calls.p  precodeltdiv idopTableContainergt     ltfromgt     lttable border1 idreturnTablegt     lttheadgt     lttrgt         ltthgt             Name         ltthgt         ltth displaytrue rel17428gt             ltimg classimgopOre srchttpimage.eveonline.comType1742832.png altTriclinic BistotgtTriclinic Bistot         ltthgt         ltth displaytrue rel17429gt             ltimg classimgopOre srchttpimage.eveonline.comType1742932.png altMonoclinic BistotgtMonoclinic Bistot         ltthgt         ltth displaytrue rel1227gt             ltimg classimgopOre srchttpimage.eveonline.comType122732.png altOmbergtOmber         ltthgt     lttrgt     lttheadgt     lttbodygt     lttrgt         lttdgt             ltimg srcimagesredXblackBackground.png stylefloat leftgtPlayer 1         lttdgt         lttd rel17428gt             ltinput typetext stylewidth100px name17428gt         lttdgt         lttd rel17429gt             ltinput typetext stylewidth100px name17429gt         lttdgt         lttd rel1227gt             ltinput typetext stylewidth100px name1227gt         lttdgt     lttrgt     lttrgt         lttdgt             ltimg srcimagesredXblackBackground.png stylefloat leftgtPlayer 2         lttdgt         lttd rel17428gt             ltinput typetext stylewidth100px name17428gt         lttdgt         lttd rel17429gt             ltinput typetext stylewidth100px name17429gt         lttdgt         lttd rel1227gt             ltinput typetext stylewidth100px name1227gt         lttdgt     lttrgt     lttbodygt     lttablegt     ltdiv classspacergt     ltdivgt     ltinput typebutton valueSubmitgtltfromgt ltdivgt codepre  pBelow is a sample of what the javascript looks like for the toggle event for the ore.

The ant can move one space at a time left, right, up or down.  That is, from cell x, y the ant can go to cells x1, y, x1, y, x, y1, and x, y1. Points where the sum of the digits of the x and y coordinates are greater than 25 are inaccessible to the ant. For example, the point 59,79 is inaccessible because 5  9  7  9  30, which is greater than 25.

Negative 279 pIm writing a program in .NET c. Im sending a broadcast ping on my local network. All of my target devices are able to respond to a ping broadcast, and indeed i track all of their responses in Wireshark. My goal is to retrieve IP addresses of all responding stations.p  pProblem is, Microsofts API does not include support for recording all replies in a given time interval.Functions like IcmpSendEcho simply return on first reply although the API states that it can record more than one icmp reply, this is a known issue and after googling and searching here, everyone reports the same problem with these functions.p  pWhat can I do to achieve my goal without going too lowlevel for reply fetching Does windows hold some sort of a record of icmp history Ill be grateful for any suggestionsp

Negative 279 pIm still working on moving my android app over to OpenGL and im once again having an issue.p  pI have gotten to the point where everything FUNCTIONS, the only problem is that the animation seems a little juddery. p  pIm monitoring the frame rates and seeing that the drawing thread isnt slowing down, but every once in a while, the main loop slows a bit and I suspect Im having a problem I was worried about. p  pThe way the app works is that as new objects say for instance, enemies are created, 2 objects are actually created. The first one is created and mapped in the main thread, and then in its constructor, it creates a mesh object which is then added to a group to be drawn continuously by the renderer.p  pEvery time an attribute for the object is changed, such as its coordinates The object relays the necessary command to its mesh counterpart in this example to translate the mesh.p  pIt was suggested that this was thread safe communication, but im having my doubts. I also notice a greater amount of frame skip when new objects are created, I can fix this somewhat by reusing the same mesh object for identical Game objects, but I dont believe this will fix everything by itself. p  pCan you think of a way to make this more efficient and threadsafep  pAnother possible solution The game logic does not HAVE to go at full speed realtime I have it actually set up so that no updates are made untill 33 millis pass. So obviously, I should have plenty of time between frames to draw, can I set it up so that draw is only called on command in the thread after the game logic has been updatedp

Negative 279 pThis is admittedly an unusual question I would never recommend replacing a boolean with a ManualResetEvent in typical .NET development.  In this case, I already need a ManualResetEvent  to indicate connection status to another thread given that, it occurs to me that the use of a boolean with the same semantic meaning is redundant.p  pOK, specifics I have a worker thread that should process messages when the following conditions are truep  ul liClient connectedli liRecipient connectedli ul  pThe client and recipient connections are TCP sockets which other threads are monitoring when either connection status changes, the corresponding WaitHandle will be set Connected or reset Disconnected.p  pOriginally, I had a boolean indicated the connection state for UI. Now that I am using WaitHandles to signal the worker thread, it seems advantageous to eliminate the boolean state variables entirely and just use the WaitHandles.p  precodewaitEvent.WaitOne 0  codepre  preturns the state of the handle without blocking, making it functionally identical to testing a boolean value with the added advantage of threadsafe operation.p  pSo, given that I am already going to be using the WaitHandles, and I dont like the idea of maintaining the state same semantic meaning into two different variables, is there any reason why I cant just use the WaitHandles  The most significant counterargument I can think of is runtime performance time to test a boolean vs. time to test the WaitHandle but I dont think performance will be that significantly affected.p  pAm I missing anything significant herep  pThanksp

Negative 279 pI have a DirectShow filter graph in my Delphi 6 application built with the DSPACK component library.  The structure of the graph is as followsp  ul liCustom push source audio filterli liSample Grabberli liTee Filter but only when I turn on both the WAV File Writer and Rendererli liRenderer preferred PC output deviceli liWAV File Writerli ul  pThe Tee Filter is added to the graph only if I have strongbothstrong the Renderer and the WAV File Writer filters turned on.  Otherwise I connect only the filter that emisem turned on directly to the Sample Grabber.p  pThe audio is being delivered over a WiFi connected RTSP audio server that is streaming audio in realtime.  If I strongdontstrong turn on the Wav File Writer, the audio coming out my headphones has the typical pumping and occasional clicking sounds associated with an unbuffered audio stream.  Strangely enough, as soon as I turn on the WAV File Writer filter the audio becomes smooth as glass.p  pI have the source code for the WAV File Writer and it basically handles the tasks of outputting the proper WAV file header when needed and writing the audio buffers as necessary, not much more than that.  So I find it strange that turning it on smooths the incoming audio stream, especially since it is not upstream of the Renderer filter but instead is a peer filter hanging off the end of the Tee Filter alongside the Renderer.p  pCan anyone tell me what might be happening to make the audio delivery smooth out when when I turn on the File Writer filter  Does the Tee Filter do any inherent buffering  I want to duplicate the same mechanism so I can have smooth audio when the File Writer is not turned on.  Im trying to avoid adding my own buffering because I dont want to add any more delay to the real time audio stream than I have to.p

Negative 279 pI am trying to make a resource loader, and wish to have a class resource and a template class resource manager. Different types of resources inherit from the base resource class, for example a image, 3d mesh etc.p  pI could have a map for any type of resource, but then I will be unable to call functions specific to a derived class. A 3dMesh might have getVertecies where as a image might have getWidth etc.p  pBecause of that I was going to use a templated resourceManager class.p  pThen you could create resource managers likep  precode resourceManagerlt3dMeshgt resMan3DMeshes  resourceManagerltpicturegt resManPictures codepre  pThe resource manager would return a pointer of the resource type rather than the base resource class. That way you could call functions specific to each resource type.  p  precode pointerToMeshgtgetVerticies  pointerToPicturegtgetWidth codepre  pHowever, using this approach, you could pass in anything to make a resource manager of.p  precode resourceManagerltintgt resManInts codepre  pThis would be fine, except the resource manager should be able to call functions of the base resource class. For example, the base resource class would have a virtual function for loading from a file, but the resource manager would be unable to call those functions as it could be passed anything as a template, and an int or string or whatever doesnt have loadFromFile.p  pI was thinking of doing something with template specilaisation with the base class, but then it would return pointers of the base class and not the derived ones, unless I specialised it for every single derived class, but then I may as well not have a templated class, but instead just have a resource manager class for each type.p  pSo, is there any way of using templates and having the advantage of calling functions of derived classes, while still getting  acsess to functions of the base classp

Negative 279 pI am working on a little project for SharePoint 2010 that will allow users to authenticate with their OpenID and maybe more later on.p  pHow it currently works is I have a membership and role provider based on SQL. My login page uses DotNetOpenAuth to send an authenticationrequest to the OpenID endpoint. If I get a positive response I read the email address from the OpenID persona and create a session for the MembershipUser that has that email address if I know the endpoint hes from. If that user doesnt exist, I create a new MembershipUser and store the endpoint in the comment property so that you cant simply edit your own persona to log in as another persons email address.p  pThis works, but the problem is in creating the session.

Negative 279 pIm using ZXing barcode scanner with my project and I am having issues with 1D barcodes. The average success of scanning the barcode is 6 out of 10. 6 times the code comes right, but 4 of them the numbers come all shuffled.

Because we can have so many different interfaces we want use, and declaration on that class constructor can be messy. p
Negative 279 pI want to create a custom wpf control that contains a Button and a ContentPresenter. As WPF controls are supposed to be lookless I created a class that is supposed to contain my controls behaviour and I put default style for the control inside generic.xaml file. So far so good.p  pBut how do I make my button raise an event routed event and handle it in my controls class I figured out that I can add code behind file for the ResourceDictionary from generic.xaml and put my event handlers there, but that would associate behaviour of my control with its template and is therefore not desirable.  Another idea I have seen but not yet tried is to use TemplatePart mechanism to locate some key controls inside the template and subscribe to events in code. But that does not seem flexible enough for me because it may happen that the user of my control will want to replace button with a control that does not have any event I know of at the time of designing my control.p  pSo how do I raise event in XAML when button is clicked and subscribe to it in my controls code filep

Negative 279 pWe are using Apache Camel as an orchestration engine. Typically, the following scenariop  pclient sends HTTP request lt CAMEL code lt external serversp  pThe ball starts to roll when our client sends a HTTP request to our CAMEL code. The Camel code will trigger external servers via REST HTTP calls. Eventually, the Camel code will send a reply back to the client.p  pThe last action before sending the response back to the client, the Camel code sends a HTTP GET towards an external server. So a TCP connection is setup first, then the data sent. After some time this might take up 5 to 10 seconds, the external server replies with a 200 OK.p  pProblem Camel does not send a TCP FIN to the external server after receiving the 200 OK. As a result, the TCP connection remains open ... the external server then closes the TCP connection itself after a timeout of 200 seconds, but this means a TCP resource lost during 200 seconds.p  pSo, at TCP level, it goes like thisp  pCamel lt external serverp  precode   TCP SYN  gt    lt TCP SYN,ACK    TCP ACK  gt     HTTP GET gt    lt 200 OK    TCP ACK  gt     lt200 seconds latergt    lt TCP FIN,ACK    TCP ACK  gt codepre  pAny idea how I can have Camel close the TCP connection after it has received the 200 OK p  pNote I tried adding the Connection close header, but Camel did not add the header  It seemed to ignore it ...p  pThis was the code to add the headerp  precodeexchange.getOut.setHeaderConnection,Close codepre  pI am using Camel 2.9.1 in a Spring framework with Eclipse IDE.p

I am trying to make a cylindrical roll printer, using a optical rotary encoder providing a location feedback The height of the document represents the circumference of the roll surface, the width of the document represent the number of revolutions.p  pThe following is a grossly untested logic of my ENCreg, pretty much unrelated to the image processing part, but this may help brothers and sisters to see what I am trying to do with the processed array of a tiff image. i is indexed from 0 to imageHeight, however, each element may be an arbitrary number ranging from 0 to imageHeight, could be 112, 354 etc that corresponds to whatever the location that contains black in the tiff image. j is indexed from 0 to imageWidth, and each element there is also starting 0 to imageWidth. For example, ptLocArray[1][2] means the first location that has a black pixel in column 2, the value stored there could be 231. the 231st pixel counting from the top of column 2.p  pI realized that the array[imageHeight][] should be instead array[maxnumblackPixelPerColumn], but I dont know how to count the number of 1s, or 0s per column....because I dont know how to convert the 1s and 0s in the right order as I mentioned earlier..p  precodevoid ENCreg    ifinputPortENCreg  true  true if received an encoder signal                 ENCregTemp   increment ENC register temp value by one each time the port registers a signal                  ifENCregTemp  ptLocArray[i][j]                                      Rollprint  print it                     i  increment by one to the next height location that indicates a black, meaning print                      if ENCregTemp  imageHeight                                           Check if end of column reached, end of a revolution                     j  jump to next column of the image starting next revolution                     i  0  reset i index to 0, to the top of the next column                     ENCregTemp  0  reset encoder register temp to 0 for the new revolution                                                      ENCreg  recall itself               codepre

Negative 279 pI am using HTC wild fire for android development. I have a small doubt. Does connection type matter when we try to run the app on eclipse with the device.For me, in run configurations, device is shown only if the connection type is disk drive. If i select Internet pass through then it, does not show.  All these days it appeared to me that connection type does not matter. I believe it should work just by enabling the debugging options.Should i change any other setting to make it appear on the list of devices in eclipsep
Negative 279 pIm not getting the javadoc I guess its called popup in Eclipse which gives details about the JavaAndroid method Im currently hovered over. For instance, if I type codeLog.dcode and hit CTRLSPACE there is usually a popup which shows some info about the Log.d method. This isnt happening. Any ideas how to fix it  I recently upgraded to jdk1.7.006 and I think the Java docs got smoked somehow. I followed a few different threads on S.O. to try and fix it but still nothing.  p  pIve downloaded jdk7u6apidocs.zip from oracle and tried loading it in codeWindow gt Preferences gt Java gt Installed JREs gt [select jre] Edit gt JavaDoc locationcode but when I try to validate, a popup says emLocation might be invalid. Files packagelist and index.html that are typically available at the root of the documentation created by the Javadoc tool have not been foundemp  pSo then, in the same dialog above, I ticked Javadoc URL and entered emhttpdownload.oracle.comjavase7docsapiem. It validates OK, but I still dont have documentation for Log.d and others.p  pSo, I guess how do I get the documentation popup back, and is this a java issue or android SDK issuep

Negative 279 pI have got a MainPage and a DetailPage. Both of them use a static class to receive their data.

Negative 279 pThe code below is my subprogram to do reverse polish notation calculations... basically , , , and .

Negative 279 pIm trying to repeat a step in Django Formwizard Django 1.4 conditionally based on a checkbox in the step.

It also doesnt have a current step attribute or step attribute but I can access the current step through the QueryDict of the form.

Negative 279 pIm having problems with code[UICollectionView reloadData]code, which seems to get stuck for quite a while before it calls codenumberOfSectionsInCollectionViewcode on its delegate that I have specified. This is what happensp  pThe app starts with the UICollectionView immediately visible and codenumberOfSectionsInCollectionViewcode is called on the delegate, which returns the number of items in an empty array i.e. 0 and immediately starts to download the data for the array from a web service. Once the download is complete, the data is deserialized and added to the above array, then codereloadDatacode is called on the codeUICollectionViewcode instance. This is where the app seems to stop doing anything, and after 2030 seconds or sometimes up to a minute, the delegate receives a call to codenumberOfSectionsInCollectionViewcode. As soon as this call is received, the reload quickly completes.p  pI believe codereloadDatacode runs in its own thread, but Ive tried starting it in a separate thread to ensure that its not any of my code blocking the process. What could codereloadDatacode be doing while it appears stuck Are there any intermediary delegate methods between codereloadDatacode and codenumberOfSectionsInCollectionViewcode that I should be implementing I thought that is the first method to be called following a reload as far as an iOS developer is concerned.p  pIf anyone could tell me what may be going wrong, fantastic, but Id also appreciate any tips on how to debug thisp

Yes, both codes do close the application, but only after a fully finished constructor code.p  pcodeWhycode would I need such a thing Well, because at startup I need to check for various things, like availability of the connection and hardware, validate the user etc, and if anything fails, theres no point of executing more code.p  pTried the same principle with Winforms and WPF hence the tags, works the same.p  pstrongCan anybody provide an explanation or maybe a solutionstrong I know this is probably very basic to some of you, but please, bare with me, Im not primarily a Windows programmer, so this is kinda new for me. Websites work a bit differently... p

Negative 279 pIm looking for an example of code that samples signal from microphone and plays it on speakers. I need a solution that has a resonably constant delay on different platforms PC, android, iphone. Delay around 12 s is ok for me, and I dont mind if it varies everytime the application starts.p  pI tried using SampleDataEvent.SAMPLEDATA event on Sound and Microphpne classess. One event would put data into buffer the other would read data. But it seems impossible to provide constant delay, either the delay grows constantly or it gets lower to the point where I have less than 2048 samples to put out and Sound class stops generating SampleDataEvent.SAMPLEDATA events.p  pI want to process each incoming frame so using setLoopBacktrue is not an option.p  pps This is more a problem on Android devices than on PC.

Negative 279 pI noticed that an application that I am developing a game written in C  XNA occasionally behaves differently depending on whether it is started from within Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 compared to when it is started outside MSVS e.g. from Windows Explorer.

The game uses a number of external dlls nuclex lib, sharp dx but these libs are all used both from within MSVS and outside. The game entirely runs in a single thread.p  pstrongPlease note that the question is not about a specific error that I need to debug, but it is about general differences that could arise from the way an application is started.strongp

This works correctly, and if a value for codeteff1code is not given or is out of range, on clicking the strongSubmitstrong button, as given in the codefooterButtons.xhtmlcode, the submit fails and and the codelthmessagegtcode tag displays an error. p  pHowever, before clicking strongSubmitstrong, if the input field for codeteff1code is empty or has a wrong value, the codeltpcommandButton valueSelect Set ...gtcode in the included codeabundances0.xhtmlcode does not work.  It is supposed to update a display with a chosen menu, which otherwise it does.  I set the codeimmediatecode attribute of codeltpcommandButton valueSelect Set gtcode to codetruecode, but it still does not work.  I only want the validation to take place when the strongSubmitstrong button is clicked, and nothing else.p  pI tried an alternative way where the flag codevalidatecode in the simulator bean is used to disable the validation until it is wanted. Namely, when the codeoption1code page is visited it is codefalsecode, to disabled is codetruecode, and no validation is done until the submit button is clicked, at which point it is set to codetruecode, so disabled is codefalsecode.  Unfortunately, this dose not work, as JSF thinks the page is valid and navigates away from it before validation is performed.  This is in spite of the fact that codevalidatecode is executed before codesubmitcode in the simulator bean.  This is confirmed by inserting a print statement in each of them.p  pDoes anybody have any idea as to what is going on, and is there an easy way of making sure that validation only takes place when the submit button is clicked  Otherwise the display is locked up, and Im unable to make the other buttons work.p  hr  pMany thanks for the clarification, and I did exactly what you suggested.  I did the followingp  pFirst I put immdiatetrue in the command button that selects a menu in my abundances0.xhtml filep  precodeltpcommandButton valueSelect Set actionListenerabundance.selectSet0 updateabundances0 immediatetruegt codepre  pthen I changed the action in my abundance bean java filep  precodepublic void selectSet0ActionEvent e      selectSet0     FacesContext.getCurrentInstance.renderResponse   codepre  pbut it still does not work.  If I click the button nothing happens unless a valid value is already in the input field for teff1 in the option1.xhtml file at the beginning.  I need this button to work, together with other ones like it, regardless of what is in the input field, until the submit button is clicked.  As far as I can see, I am doing everything correctly.p  pIcidentally, Im using JSF 2.0 with PrimeFaces 3.4.2 and Eclipse Indigo.p

Negative 279 pI allow the user to enter in what start date and end date they need.I set my start and end date parameters to Start and End. They have no values stored in them, rather in my code I have      ....Between Start and End.  The dates entered by the user gets passed into my program instead of me specifying what the user is allowed to enter  in the parameter properties. My problem is I want the default start of each date picked to be 500 AM Instead of 000 AM. This way when the user picks for example 220 and 221, they can retrieve date from 500 AM 500 AM. This enables my program to show data past midnight, which is necessary because my data stops at 300 AM.p

I know I used to get this when implementing a Queue in separated .h and .cpp files. But worked around it by doing everything in the header. I also know that this can happen when not implementing a named method, but I cant find any of those here. So whats causing this I wish the compiler  IDE could point me to the possible cause of the error. But then again, if it was an easy task to find the faulty line, I assume it would already do this. VS 2012 btw.p
Negative 279 pI will use a simplified example to explain my case.p  pI have strongtwostrong libme.so files which have different implementations and I already verified that they can work in a single design at the same time. One is located at .rootv1 and the other one is located at .rootv2p  pMy main .so file is linked with those 2 libme.so files and is located at .rootlibtest.sop  pNow I have the requirement to make the things relocatable. That is, if I copy the entire root directory to another location or even another machine assuming binary compatible, things should still work fine. p  pMy question is, to make this work, what gcc command line should I use to build libtest.sop  pIve tried the following twop  p1 assuming Im in root directoryp  precodegtgcc shared o libtest.so .v1libme.so .v2libme.so codepre  pThis will make libtest.so has those 2 link dependencies both with absolute paths. This can be verified via lddp  precodegtldd libtest.so homedesignrootv1libme.so homedesignrootv2libme.so codepre  pObviously the paths are fixed. So once I relocate the root directory, it cannot find libme.so at runtime. Note setting LDLIBRARYPATH doesnt work in this case since the path from ldd is absolute path. The runtimer loader will not search LDLIBRARYPATH to find libme.so.p  p2 p  precodegtgcc shared o libtest.so lme L.v1 L.v2 codepre  pThis will work only if we have a single version of libme.so. In this case, the version in .v2 will not get linked in. The same issue exists for rpath.p  pGiven that, what other options do I havep  pNote there are some restrictions 1 cannot rename libme.so to other names such as libmev1.so 2 libtest.so has to link in both versions of libme.sop
Negative 279 pusing C here. Im creating a console app. I have two methods that scroll text instead of just instantly displaying it on the screen. One works the same as Console.Write and the other works like Console.WriteLine. The difference is there is a 30 ms delay between each character. Im trying to make it so that when you hold down a key it speeds up to a 5ms delay between each character. The problem is that once you hit a key the Console.KeyAvailable is true and wont reset, and so it keeps going with only a 5ms delay.

Negative 279 pThis may turn out to be more of a style question, but Im a little stumped on how best to design a RESTful API.p  pLets say I want to provide the following API callsp  ul liGET player ul liReturns the current playerli ulli liGET playerid ul liReturns the specified playerli ulli liPOST adminplayerid ul liRegisters the specified Playerli ulli liPUT adminplayerid ul liUpdates the specified Playerli ulli ul  pAs you probably surmised, the last two require administrative rights, and the first two merely require a user to be logged into the system.p  pSo my question involves how best to lay this API out into resources.  My first instinct is to create a single PlayerResource that doesnt have a classlevel Path annotation, but rather defines each method with codePathplayer...code or codePathadminplayer...code accordingly.  Will that work  It just smells a bit to me, so is there a better way to do this stylewise  The only alternative I can think of is to create a separate resource class to contain the adminonly calls, but that smells to me too since Id have two resources dealing with the same model class.p  pIm just looking for a little guidance on how best to design this thing.  This is my first RESTful web app, so forgive my horrible ignorance.  Thanksp

Negative 279 pI looked up these concepts, and I want to see if Ive understood them correctly. Mainly Im trying to distinguishing these three concepts apart. From googling and other results on here, I saw a lot of detail on them that people provided, but many of them are either not completely clear to me, contradicting, or interchange the concepts IoCDI. Im trying to define in a more simpler way thatd be easier for me to digest, and I want to see if its accurate enough. p  pInversion of Controlp  pThe client class doesnt directly instantiate the implementation classes of its dependent fields as it depends on some other external classsource to supply them. In most cases, the fields are a parent class or interface that has one or more subclasses that will be supplied as the implementation.p  pDependency Injectionp  pThe client class receives the implementation classes for its dependent fields, whether through a constructor, setter, or otherwise, and this implementation is a fresh new object instance. The supplying class might use another pattern, such as a factory, in order to determine what implementation to pass to the client or it might even just straight up instantiate a new instance and pass it into the clients constructor. p  pService Locatorp  pThe client class is the one that calls the service locator to supply its dependent fields. The implementation that is returned is an object instance that may be shared with any other client classes that rely on the same dependency.p  pMy attempts at a very simple examplep  pDIp  precodepublic interface IX     public class X  IX     public class A      IX depField      public AIX depField          this.depField  depField           public void main      A myClass  new Anew X  codepre  pSLp  precodepublic interface IX     public class X  IX     public class A      IX depField  serviceLocatorObj.GetServiceltIXgt      where IX is mapped to X in the service locator class   public void main      A myClass  new A  codepre  pIoC is the concept on the receiving side, where as DI and SL are two possible ways of dealing with the concept on the supplying side.p  pThanks.

Negative 279 pIve got a Linq to XML query here, but in the XML document that im querying there are a lot of duplicate element values being returned. This hasnt caused a problem so far as my code filters out duplicates later on before it builds a treeview with the data.p  pHowever, ive noticed that my program is slowing down significantly if there are many many system and subsystem elements with the same values.

Negative 279 pI am attempting to edit a Wordpress plugin for a client which is used to print a coupon by using a custom javascript function to print the contents of a div.

When you click on the generated print button then a window opens and brings up a print dialogue for the jpg.

Is there a right way to do thisp  pUPDATE So I have a solution that works  but it sure is ugly on the inside. Still looking for a better way.p  pSo I have to somehow define the symbols I need in the object that loads the builtin interfaces. I dont think there is a way to force the linker to link in a symbol otherwise. E.g. There is no way that I know of to build a library with a function that is always linked wether it looks needed or not. This is entirely at the discretion of the link step for the executable.p  pSo in the executable I have a macro that defines the builtin interfaces I need. Each builtin plugin has a prefix to all of its interface functions so, at the top of the file I dop  precodeDEFINEBUILTINPLUGIN PluginOne  DEFINEBUILTINPLUGIN PluginTwo  codepre  pThis will force the definitions of the functions I need. But the macro to do this is so ugly that Im filled with feelings of rage and self doubt  Ive removed the trailing slashes from the macro for readability p  precodedefine FORCEUNDEFINEDSYMBOLx      void fp  x  fp voidampx      if ptrv fp  x fp   rand  1  lt 1           exit0  define DEFINEBUILTINPLUGIN PREFIX     extern C                                                                                                          KSrvRequestHandler PREFIX  CreateRequestHandler const char name      bool                PREFIX  DestroyRequestHandler KSrvRequestHandler handler            const char        PREFIX  ListRequestHandlerTypes     class PREFIX  HandlerInterfaceMagic        public     PREFIX  HandlerInterfaceMagic              FORCEUNDEFINEDSYMBOL PREFIX  CreateRequestHandler          FORCEUNDEFINEDSYMBOL PREFIX  DestroyRequestHandler          FORCEUNDEFINEDSYMBOL PREFIX  ListRequestHandlerTypes                        PREFIX  HandlerInterfaceMagic PREFIX  HandlerInterfaceMagicInstance codepre  pSince the compiler is an optimizing genuis, in FORCEUNDEFINEDSYMBOLS Im going to great lengths to trick the compiler into linking an unreferenced function. That macro only works inside a function. So I have to create this bogus Magic class. There must be a better way.p  pAnyway  it does work.p

Is it possible that Proguard does this so well it may be called added security p  pWhat is most sensitive are some network calls. It will be hard to sniff the password because we will generate the password on both sides and check its validity with timestamps. Problem is the app may be reverse engineered and the generate algorithm may be exploited. p  pIt is not possible to keep the algorithm locally in a file because with a rooted phone the cracker may be able to retrieve it.

Verify the username of the authenticated user with User.Identity.Name.pli   lipIf youre calling one of the Membership.GetUser overloads which takes the username and its returning null, then that user doesnt exist in the Membership datasource or weve got a bug.

Negative 279 pFor my multiproject build, Im trying to create a verify task that just results in sccttest and then scalastyle being executed in order. I would like sccttest to execute for all the subprojects, but not the toplevel project. If it executes for the toplevel project, I get timed out waiting for coverage report from scct, since theres no source and no tests in that project. What I had thought to do was to create verify as a task with dependencies on sccttest and scalastyle. This has turned out to be fairly baroque. Here is my Build.scala from my toplevel project directoryp  precodeobject MyBuild extends Build    val verifyTask  TaskKey[Unit]verify, Compiles, runs tests via sccttest and then runs scalastyle   val scctTestTask  test in ScctPlugin.Scct.scopedKey   val scalastyleTask  PluginKeys.scalastyleTarget.scopedKey    lazy val root  ProjectrootProject,                       file.,                       settings   Defaults.defaultSettings                                    ScalastylePlugin.Settings                                    ScctPlugin.instrumentSettings                                    ScctPlugin.mergeReportSettings                                    Seq                                     verifyTask in Global  ,                                     verifyTask ltlt verifyTask.dependsOnscctTestTask, scalastyleTask                                                   aggregateliftwebapp, seleniumtests    lazy val subproject1  Projectid  subproject1, base  filesubproject1    lazy val subproject2  Projectid  subproject2, base  filesubproject2  codepre  pHowever, the verify task only seems to exist for the root project when I run it I dont see the same task being run in the subprojects. This is exactly the opposite of what I want Id like to issue codesbt verifycode and have sccttest and scalastyle run in each of the subprojects but not in the toplevel project. How might I go about doing thatp

Negative 279 pI have some html for a layout for a page for a site for software library my research group made. This is done with bootstrap 3. What I would like to achieve is the navbar that occurs just below the jumbotron to become fixed to the top of the page once it gets scrolled up there. Id also like similar behaviour for the nag element in the left column of the page  when the page is scrolled and they reach the top  that they then become fixed and stay there. From reading I understand that Affix in twitter bootstrap is the way to go about doing this, but Im not entirely sure I can figure how to do this right.p  pWith the HTML below what happens is after scrolling so far the navbar which should span the page becomes squashed  the navbar links move to one row below the navbar brand and the bar nolonger spans the page. Once I figure out how to use affix with the navbar I hope to use it with the nav element. Can anyone explain what I need to do to get the effect Im fairly new to web design stuff.p  pThanks, Ben.p  pHTMLp  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtmlgt     ltheadgt         ltmeta charsetutf8gt         lttitlegtSOFTWARE  GETTING STARTED WITH SOFTWARElttitlegt          ltlink relstylesheet hrefcssbootstrap.css typetextcssgt     ltheadgt     ltbodygt         ltstylegt             .jumbotron                  marginbottom 0px                      ltstylegt         lt Start of main container gt         ltdiv classcontainerfluid maingt             ltdiv classrowfluidgt                 ltdiv classjumbotrongt                     lth1gt Getting Started lth1gt                     ltpgt Installing SOFTWARE on your machine is easy for most systems.

If i check the image in the blob viewer in the app engine console, it seems to have the correct size.p  pWhy do I get a resized version of my image with the following code. Can I somehow retrieve the url to the full sized imagep  pMy code looks like thisp  precodepublic class MyUploadAction extends AppEngineUploadAction      Override     public String executeActionHttpServletRequest request, ListltFileItemgt sessionFiles throws UploadActionException           String imageUrls             Image service is needed to get url from blob         ImagesService imagesService  ImagesServiceFactory.getImagesService           Get a file service gt write the blob         FileService fileService  FileServiceFactory.getFileService           Iterate over the files and upload each one         forFileItem myFile  sessionFiles              InputStream imgStream  null              construct our entity objects             Blob imageBlob  null               Create a new Blob file with mimetype imagepng             AppEngineFile file  null              FileWriteChannel writeChannel  null             try                   get input stream from file                 imgStream  myFile.getInputStream                 imageBlob  new BlobIOUtils.toByteArrayimgStream                   create empty app engine file with mime type of uploaded file e.g. imagepng, imagejpeg                 file  fileService.createNewBlobFilemyFile.getContentType                   Open a channel to write to it                 boolean lock  true                 writeChannel  fileService.openWriteChannelfile, lock                   This time we write to the channel directly                 writeChannel.writeByteBuffer.wrapimageBlob.getBytes               catch IOException e                  e.printStackTrace             finally                  Now finalize                 try                      writeChannel.closeFinally                  catch IllegalStateException e                       TODO Autogenerated catch block                     e.printStackTrace                  catch IOException e                       TODO Autogenerated catch block                     e.printStackTrace                                              Get the url from the blob             ServingUrlOptions suo  ServingUrlOptions.Builder.withBlobKeyfileService.getBlobKeyfile.secureUrltrue             imageUrls  imagesService.getServingUrlsuo             imageUrls  imageUrls.replaceFirst0.0.0.0, 127.0.0.1             System.out.printlnimageUrls                   return imageUrls        codepre

Negative 279 pI just downloaded Hibernate 4.2.5 because Im long overdue for an upgrade.  I know that Hibernate uses the LGPL with their own classpath exception which they list on their web sitep  blockquote   pThe use of the unmodified Hibernate binary of course never affects   the license of your application or distribution.   a hrefhttpwww.hibernate.orglicense relnofollowhttpwww.hibernate.orglicenseap blockquote  pThe release I downloaded includes jbosslogging3.1 which is clearly labeled as LGPL code, but not labeled as part of Hibernate.  We require a classpath exception in order to use any LGPL code.  We use Proxool instead of c3p0 for this reason.p  pSo Im looking for the newest version of Hibernate that does not require jbosslogging.  Anyone knowp
Negative 279 pI have a simple question. I have a list of objects. Each object holds a few lists. Before this gets too complicated, let me illustratep  blockquote   px  a listp      px[[1]]  some objectp      px[[2]]  another objectp      p...p      px[[n]]  another objectp blockquote  pAnd as I said, each object holds some more lists. But Im interested in a specific list, lets call it a.p  blockquote   px[[1]][[a]]  A 1, B 2, C 3, ..., Z 26p blockquote  pSorry for the pythonlike syntax I am really just learning R. Anyway, what I want to do is combine the lists held in these objects, then take their median. To make this more clear, I want to group all A elements, then take their medianp  blockquote   px[[1]][[a]][[A]], x[[2]][[a]][[A]], x[[3]][[a]][[A]], ..., x[[n]][[a]][[A]]p blockquote  pSimilarly I want to group all B, C, ..., Z elements and take their median...p  blockquote   px[[1]][[a]][[Z]], x[[2]][[a]][[Z]], x[[3]][[a]][[Z]], ..., x[[n]][[a]][[Z]]p blockquote  pSo the question is whats the best way to do this Ive spent hours trying to figure this out It would be great if someone could help me.p  pAnd if you would like to know what Im actually doing, basically I have a list x of random forest objects. So x[[1]] is the first random forest, x[[100]] is the 100th random forest. Each random forest has a list of predicted values, which are stored in, e.g. x[[1]][[predicted]]. Each prediction list has a label associated with its predicted value. What Im actually trying to do is calculate each labels median predicted value across all 100 random forests.

Negative 279 pI have written a bash script to execute a jar file. The script is placed on a server. The folder also contains the jar file and the data which will be used by the jar. My jar file takes an input file path and then generates an output folder with the result files. This jar works without any errors when I run it directly via command line. But when I submit the job to a cluster and run the bash script, the prompt where the user input is required goes in a standard output file. How should I provide this input to the jar file And, at which location will the output folder be generatedp

Negative 279 pIve been facing an intermittent issue with automapper across a couple of different projects.p  p99.9 of the time, mapping on nullable bools works properly.  However, intermittently, at some point it starts incorrectly mapping false and null values for sure, and on even rarer occasion I have seen it map false to true.p  pFor a long time I thought it might be in my head, but today it was verified while demonstrating a new piece of functionality to my coworker.  Consistently, it was mapping null to false, and false to null.  Once it starts, it will happen with every nullable bool, as far as I can tell.  p  pThe odd thing is that it will stop doing this as soon as I rebuild the project.p  pOn one project, we believe that the problem was solved by writing a small function that just took in the source values and gave the obvious values back, but that was on mapping from a nullable bool to a nonnullable bool.  But today, it happened from a nullable bool to a nullable bool.p  pAnd I have not one idea how to debug this.  I cant get it to reproduce with any degree of predictability, and have gone so far as to write a selenium test that ran 3000 times to attempt to trip it off, to no avail.p  pI have a trace.axd from the request from earlier today, if that might help out.p  pCan anyone give me suggestions  We use C, Visual Studio, IIS, AutoMapper, and .Net MVC and Entity Framework.p  pAt this point, Im so flustered that I dont know what other information I can give.  Im on the high end of junior developer myself, but it was verified by a senior developer on my team today.  Feels nice to know Im not seeing things.p

Negative 279 pI have a personal live site at a hrefhttpbrunomoreira.net relnofollowhttpbrunomoreira.neta based on the great Touchfolio theme a hrefhttpdimsemenov.comthemestouchfolio relnofollowhttpdimsemenov.comthemestouchfolioa for Wordpress. Since I dont know LESS, Ive changed it to use a regular style.css stylesheet. Everything looks fine except when viewing the Projects List a hrefhttpbrunomoreira.netprojectslist relnofollowhttpbrunomoreira.netprojectslista section on a iPhone. The masonry blocks appear slightly padded to the right and that makes them not appear 100 visible on the iPhone screen and it lets me swipe to the right, which shouldnt be possible. I believe it may be a problem with margins or padding in the CSS or in the masonry code itself, but cant figure it out. Any help appreciated,  thanks. Brunop

Negative 279 pI have designed a simple 3state x,xdot,xdotdot Kalman filter which is updated by measurements for x and xdot. The filter is tracking a peak on a surface in the xxdot plane. At each iteration, I detect a number of peaks on the surface, each with an xxdot measurement pair.p  pI need to select the peak which is closest to the current state as input for the next filter iteration. At the moment I am simply finding the difference in the x and xdot dimensions, scaling them so they are similar in scale, and then computing the 2D distance. This has been working fine for me, but I know it is not the right way to calculate the distance.p  pIs there a way to use the Kalman variables to determine which measurement is closest to the current estimatep  pNot sure where this belongs, so Ive posted it in stack, dsp, math, and stats exchanges.p

Negative 279 pI am using PHP to connect to APNS and generally it works fine  Im still in the sandbox environment, I havent used production yet.  I initially used PHP code based on the Ray Wenderlich pushchat tutorial and then moved to ApnsPHP, running on Ubuntu.  My server process makes its connection, polls the database to see if any messages have to be sent, sends them, sleeps a bit and then polls again.p  pBoth attempts have displayed the same problem.  After a period of inactivity eg overnight, the first message will not be sent to the device.  No error is reported and the number of bytes written to the socket is correct.  However, when I send the second message, it fails with zero bytes written.p  pIs this expected behaviour  I havent seen any specific reference to it anywhere, although Apple advise persisting the socket connection, unless you know it will be idle for an extended period of time.  My messages are a result of user activity, so I can not predict whether the system will be idle or not.p  pI assume the connection has timedout in some way, so is there a way of doublechecking the viability of the socket connectionp  pI can think of a couple of ways round the problem, such as resending the message sent prior to a failure or monitoring how long my connection is idle and reconnecting after a certain period.  But if I did that, what would be a reasonable period of timep  pHas anyone else seen this and is there a best practise way of handling itp

Negative 279 pWith codeTransactioncode and with trace level logging of Spring I see that Hibernate has an exception on a db constraint but it just rolls back the transaction.

It seems so much easier with trycatch and old fashioned commitsrollbacks. Is there no better way  in Spring Hibernatep  pIm processing XML messages from a queue. Depending on the type of the exception I get I might want to just catch it and put the bad incoming queue message into an db error table and continue the transaction.

Are there ways of interrupting the transaction after an exception and deciding if one wants to commit, continue or rollbackp  pIf not, can one use old style commits and rollback with spring hibernatep

There exists a huge doxygen documentation for a project already, but now I would like to pick out a few blocks functions, constants etc. to create a very small manual only containing the important stuff.p  pInstead of marking 99 of the comments as internal it would be nice to have a command like external for the 1 of comments that need to be exported in my case.p  pSomething like disabling the default section everything, which is not part of a section would work too, of course. Then I could use ENABLEDSECTIONS...p  pUnfortunately the comments in question do not reside in one file only. Furthermore those files contain a lot of other comments, which should not be exported.p  pI already thought to move those comments into separate header files that could be included in the original position, but this would mean to restructure a lot and tearing files apart.p  pDoes anybody have an idea how to solve my problemp  pThanks in advance, Nicop

That is why I cant have multiple add methods, since the base class dont know what object types the ListHandler can accept.

Its a multiple dispatch problem and I dont think it can not be solved in C without the visitor pattern.p

Negative 279 pwhat is the correct way how I should form the intent to show content from my app in 3rd party viewers I need to show images in gallery or any other image viewer, pdfs in some pdf reader,..p  pData gets server through a content provider which implements the openFile method and returns a output pipe..p  precodeParcelFileDescriptor[] pipeParcelFileDescriptor.createPipe ...

My problem is that although I see for example the Photos app in the chooser, I just cannot open the file in it..It just only opens the gallery with my images. Its working when I use the action send, apps like gmail, drive, dropbox,..all of them are able to correctly read the image from the provider. Also Skitch seems to be the only one app which I have tested it on that is able to open the image also using the codeIntent.ACTIONVIEWcode action..p  pPlease dont tell me I should just send the URI, I really need to provide the file as a stream, or somehow as a serie of bytes IPC limitations would be probably against this. I cant save the file to a public directory.p

Negative 279 pI am studying an Operating System course and we have this chapter about Processes. In this chapter we define the Process Control Block, which keeps the information about a process such as the program counter, content of registers, state, priority and so on. In this chapter it says that when the processor switches to another process by interrupt, information will be saved in this process control block PC, registers,.... In another chapter 1.4 Interrupts it says when a process gets interrupted the PSW, PC and registers get put on the stack and when processor retakes control of this process it takes it from the stack.p  pIt seems to be there are 2 different explanations here for what happens when an interrupt occurs. Do they both happen simultaneously or what Can anyone explain this to mep  pThanks in advance Sanderp

Negative 279 pI have a Google spreadsheet in which I want to copy values from one range into another range using a script. Copying the values isnt hard I just use coderange.setValuesvaluesToCopycode. I also want to copy the formatting of the original range over to the new range. The problem is that whenever a percentage occurs, it doesnt apply the format correctly and always ends up off by a factor of 100. For example, if the original cell contains a value of 0.5545, the formatting of the cell turns it into 55.45 which is what I want however, when I copy the values to another range and apply the formatting with codesetNumberFormatscode, it turns it into 0.5545. How can I fix thisp  pEDIT So, after a bit more fiddling around, it appears that my script properly copies the formatting over the first time, but on subsequent executions of the script, the formatting for the percentages gets messed up, as explained above.p

Would I need a third for listing the subfolder content, or would I just reuse a codeViewcodep  pLike I said, Im just starting out with MVC, so I apologize if this is too noobish.p

Negative 279 pSo, Im trying to create a screen that when clicking a button this takes the data from some EditText and add them to a ListView item, now I know there are a lot of examples on the web and Ive done them and they work, but when I took them to what I want to do it just adds one item and stops working it doesnt throw any exception or anything, it just add one item, this is what I got so

Negative 279 pIm letting the user click on two points on a sphere and I would then like to draw a line between the two points along the surface of the sphere basically on the great circle. Ive been able to get the coordinates of the two selected points and draw a codeQuadraticBezierCurve3code between the points, but I need to be using codeCubicBezierCurve3code. The problem is is that I have no clue how to find the two control points.p  pPart of the issue is everything I find is for circular arcs and only deals with [x,y] coordinates whereas Im working with [x,y,z]. I found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11165607creatingasplinecurvebetween2pointsinthreejsthisa other question which I used to get a somewhatworking solution using codeQuadraticBezierCurve3code.

Something else I came across mentioned the tangents to the selected points, their intersection, and their midpoints.

Negative 279 pThere is an utility class called ConcurrencyUtils that uses ExecutorService internallyp  precodeprivate static final ExecutorService executor  Executors.newCachedThreadPoolnew CommonPoolThreadFactory codepre  pas you can see it uses a thread pool that will add threads on demand. The problem is that if there is at least one thread in that pool if util is used at least once then when main method execution finishes application however didnt shut down, as the threads are still alive and are not garbage collected...p  pinitially ive tried to use     p  precodepublic static void close     executor.shutdown  codepre  pand call it when the programm naturally should stop its execution. But there is no guarantee that main method is the last one to be finished and there can be other tasks that should finish before application will be terminated thus I dont know where do i call close to clear up threads in util...p  pI wonder if community can hint me a smartercleaner way to implement thisp  pConcurrencyUtil is intended to be available for use from everywhere and I cannot create an instance of it I need it to provide its interface through static not instance methods.p  hr  h2Updateh2  pLet me explain this case in detail, ConcurrencyUtil has its own implementation of pool, and it provides usefull methods to chain several runnables and execute them in paralell or make some of them wait for otherso to finish and then execute... doesent matter it should be an utility class so that whenever you want you use async or chain and dont wory how it works.p  pNow the sample code  p  precodepublic static void mainString[] args      Runtime.getRuntime.addShutdownHooknew Thread          Override         public void run              System.out.printlnhoooooooooooook                     ConcurrencyUtil.chain             .addgtSystem.out.printlntask 1             .addgtSystem.out.printlntask 2             .execute             .join      System.out.printlnmain finish  codepre  pWhen this executes ill have this  p  precodecreated new thread with name [commonpool  thread1] created new thread with name [commonpool  thread2] task 1  task 2  main finish codepre  pAs you can see thread pool creates two threads and executes concurrent tasks but those worker threads are still alive in sleep waiting for new task, thats why after main execution is finished application is still running... And shutdown hook is not working too as i suppose application is considered as alive...p  pNow given that I have no guarantee that main method is my exit point it might be a runnable that finishes execution for example if i remove .join  thats why i cant put finally block and shut down ConcurrencyUtil...p  pAny ideas how can this be done properly p

Negative 279 pI have an element with a transition applied to it. I want to control the transition by adding a class to the element which causes the transition to run. However, if I apply the class too quickly, the transition effect does not take place.p  pIm assuming this is because the code.showncode is placed onto the div during the same event loop as when code.foocode is placed onto the DOM.

Now say I have 3 images, a, b and c. I compute the camera matrices and 3D points for image a and b. Now I want to update the structure by adding image c. I estimate the camera matrix by using known 3D points calculated from a and b that match with 2D points in image c, sincep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comoqqku.png altenter image description herep  pHowever when I reconstruct the 3D points between b and c they dont add up with the existing 3D points from a and b. Im assuming this is because I dont know the correct depth estimates of the points depicted by emsem in above formula.p  pWith the a hrefhttpwww.vision.jhu.edureadinggroupsturm96factorization.pdf relnofollowfactorization method of Sturm and Triggsa I can estimate the depths and find the structure and motion. However in order to do this, all points have to be visible in all views, which is not the case for my images. How can I estimate the depths for points not visible in all views  p

Negative 279 pI have an API that is validating against an XML schema whose order is set to sequence. This means the order of the parameters has to be in a specific order.

But is there any way to ensure the order is maintained when its sent to the serverp  pRight now Im using jQuery.extend to merge my default parameters with user input to create the data object to send to the server.

Negative 279 pI have a problem with navigation and status bars in iOS 8. Status bar overlaps navigation bar. It is not a new problem, but my case is more specific.p  pIm using RESideMenu in my app and the problem shows up when I use navigation controller as the content view. I saw a dozen of solutions with changing frames of the view or screen. Such solution doesnt seem to be right, because the app after going to background and back to foreground is changing its navigation bar to right size and position. I would like to know what causes this behavior.p  pI looked at various frames and sizes to examine which parameters change after switch.p  pThese params are before switchp  precodeView frame 0.0,0.0,320.0,568.0 View bounds 0.0,0.0,320.0,568.0 View margins top 0.0, left 0.0, bottom 0.0, right 0.0 VC Preferred size 0.0,0.0 NavBar rect 0.0,0.0,320.0,44.0 NavBar bounds 0.0,0.0,320.0,44.0 NavBar margins top 0.0, left 16.0, bottom 0.0, right 16.0 codepre  pand after switchp  precodeView frame 0.0,0.0,320.0,568.0 View bounds 0.0,0.0,320.0,568.0 View margins top 0.0, left 16.0, bottom 0.0, right 16.0 VC Preferred size 0.0,0.0 NavBar rect 0.0,20.0,320.0,44.0 NavBar bounds 0.0,0.0,320.0,44.0 NavBar margins top 0.0, left 16.0, bottom 0.0, right 16.0 codepre  pAs you can see the NavBar rect has changed its YPosition from 0.0 to 20.0. If I force those params at init point it wouldnt help. It moves the navigation bar but its not the right way, after appswitch it would be even more messy. Interesting fact is, that the margins of View change after appswitch. Why does it change those leftright values anywayp  pHere my screenshotsp  pBefore switchp  pa hrefhttppostimg.orgimageddqlcm5xl relnofollowhttppostimg.orgimageddqlcm5xlap  pAfter switchp  pa hrefhttppostimg.orgimageq4exx9zql relnofollowhttppostimg.orgimageq4exx9zqlap  pI tried to hide or show status bar manually in code and per Info.plist.

Negative 279 pI used fixed aspect ratio for UIView so its square. Then I set fixed trailing and leading space to borders of the screen they are the same. And kept vertical centered position. So in result Ive got square on the center of the screen with some equal space before and after, if screen is wider square is bigger. That works perfectly in portrait orientation. But when I use landscape orientation, size of the square based on leading and trailing space becomes bigger than height of the device so its not fit. Is it a way to have square based on constrains and choosing smallest of two dimensions Is it a way to have spacing to the screen borders different for iPhone and iPadp

Negative 279 pStrange issue while using NSMutableArray as a queue.p  pGiven a singleton object SO, a ViewController object VC, and a NSMutableArray MA.

There is a problem with MA losing what it holds. p  pSteps relating to issuep  ol liSeque is initiated to load a view.li liSO requests an ID from a server.li liVCs viewDidLoad completesli liSO block function receives an ID and puts it in MA, and sends a notification to VC.li liVC receives notification and retrieves ID from MA li ol  pThe first time the view loads there is no problem. However if I go out of the view and back into it repeating the steps above the size of MA in step 4 is 1, and the size of MA in step 5 is 0. I.e.

Ive checked that nothing outside of the VC notification handler is clearing the array.  p  pA possible clue is that there is a method called message sent in obj C parlance from viewDidLoad that if commented out the issue described doesnt happen.

Negative 279 pIm simply trying to create a TinyMCE 4.1.7 for a textarea within an Iframe. Actually this works fine in Firefox and Chrome but not for the Internet Explorer. When I separately call the Iframe in a new Tab everything behaves as expected even in the Internet Explorer but as soon as Im trying to do the same with Iframe it fails. p  pThe binding I do with the following snippetp  precode    tinymce.init mode textareas, theme modern, toolbar bold italic underline strikethrough bullist numlist, menubar false,   codepre  pThere is also no error in the console thats why Im assuming the Internet Explorer is not able to correctly resolve the element for the binding.

Negative 279 pI am trying to debug performance problems with an older MVC application, using EF 5 4.4. SQL Server Profiler reveals way more queries are being ran than should be. EF appears to be generating queries for every related entity to the model in question.p  pNow this sounds like lazyloading. The thing is, no navigation properties were referenced anywhere in code at least not explicitly.p  pWhen I turn lazy loading off for the context, it fixes it.

Negative 279 pProbably a basic question, but im trying to offset a background cover image to the right at a certain media query. However I added that to the css and when it reaches the media queries it works, but if i scale a certain way there is white space. I would like to maintain the cover image properties where no matter how you rescale there is no white space. Currently I have a cropped image to load on the media query so this doesnt happen, but id rather just have one image that loads because there is not much difference in file size.p
Negative 279 pI have the requirement of loading all the data from a db table and then get it into an index for search elasticsearch to be specific. Using an ES river is not an option in my casep  pWhat I experience is the following I have the query with a specific batch sice e.g. 5000 entries. I execute that query in a loop to get the batches, increasing the offset with every iteration. First iteration takes like 19 seconds. 4th iteration is at something like 50 seconds already.p  pThat column has 7 million rows in my case, but production data would be more by a factor of 3 at least, so if that execution time keeps growing, I wont get anywhere with my approach at 7 million entries already. Later on I can use multiple threads for selecting the data for sure, but first of all I want to keep the time per select constant if possible.p  pIm wondering where that loss in performance is coming from and how to avoid or at least minimize itp  pThe table Im selecting from just has an id long and a document clob column.p  pIm using a h2 with that 7 million rows in it, maybe thats the reason Im not familiar with the performance of h2 on such a table size.p  pMy first guess was the Garbage Collector, so I had a look with VisualVM ... seemed ok though.

Negative 279 pGood morning,p  pIm working on a small project to help people to take care of some vegetable species. So Ive done an expandableListView in order to group the species, and each group each specie has 7 children. When clicking on any child, Id like the program to call my itemtext.xml, where I put a textView only to show the text related to the clicked child of that group.p  pIm not managing to do this calling. So I decided to make it in another way using switch, just to see its layout working. But instead of calling a text page, Ive programmed it to show a simple toast message for each clicked childp  pHere is this part of the code linesp  precodeexpListView.setOnChildClickListenernew OnChildClickListener           Override         public boolean onChildClickExpandableListView parent, View v,                                     int groupPosition, int childPosition, long id               switch childPosition                               case 0                     Toast.makeTextgetApplicationContext,                              Adubao da espcie   listDataHeader.getgroupPosition,                             Toast.LENGTHSHORT.show                 break                 .                 .                 . codepre  pAnother point is that my main is getting too large because I intend to pool together more than 30 species on this project, with the same 7 children each one. So I ask for hints about that too, cause until last month, I had studied only C programming, and recently started studying object oriented programming, so until the moment I couldnt come with a good idea to reduce the code lines.

Negative 279 pI dont know why this glitch is happening.  Im using a form to populate a backend table.  All of a sudden it randomly adds the new entries from the form at the top row of the backend.  Why would this be occurringbr This is frustrating as my form is designed to take the last measurement from the last entry codeDLastentry,BackEndTablecode and put it as default in the fresh form.  Now because it has decided to put new entries at the top of the table, the last entry stays the same and the default value in the fresh form stays the same which then is wrong and needs to be changed manually.br Why would this be happeningbr How might I fix it  p

Negative 279 pIm using Visual Studio Express 2015RC and I created a simple MVC 6 application, but when I try to publish it I dont see the option to deploy it to IIS, I see the options Microsoft Azure Web App, Import and File System, I tried the File System but It looks like it is more for creating stand alone applications to be launched from a console, now, when debugging I can select IIS Express or the web command, there is no IIS option, so the question is, how can I deploy the MVC6 web application I created to IISp

Negative 279 pWe are working on a SaaS based application built over azure. In this application Web server and App server is shared among all tenants but their database are separate Sql Azure. p  pNow there is a need to implement notification service which can generate notifications based on events subscriptions. System can generate different kind of event like account locked and many other and user can configure notification rule on these events. Notification can be in the form of email and sms.p  pWe are planning to implement a queue for events. Event notifier will push an even on this queue. Notification engine will subscribe to this queue. Whenever it receive a new event, it will check if there is a notification rule configured on this type of event or not. If yes, it will create a notification, which will result into emailssms. These emailssms can be stored in database or pushed to another queue. A different background process worker role can process these emails.p  pHere are my queries.p  ul lipShould we keep one single queue for events for all tenants or create separate queue for different tenants. If we keep a single queue, we can a shared subscriber service which can subscribe to this queue. We can easily scale inout this machine.pli lipSince we have different databases for each tenant, we can store their emails to their respective databases and using some service, we can pool database and send email after defined interval. But I am not sure how will we share the subscriber code in this case. pli lipWe can store mails in a nosql database like table storage in azure. A subscriber window serviceworker role can pool this table and send mails after defined interval. Again, scaling can a challenge here too.pli lipWe can store emails in queue RabbitMQ for instance. A worker role can subscribe to this queue. Scaling of worker role should not be any issue in case we keep a single queue for all tenant.pli ul  pPlease provide your inputs on these points.p  pThanks In Advancep

I was able to get the PRUmemAccessPRUDataRam example working, and then tried to develop my own application to open up UART2 and read from it. Long story short, I was having difficulties and wanted to start again with the baseline example. Now, the example no longer works, it hangs while waiting on a HALT for the PRU. I checked the other example and got the same result. I didnt change anything in the example code. What could have changed to make the examples hang there seems like the PRU code is not finishing, but there are no jumps or branches, so is it just not runningp  pThanksp

Negative 279 pI want to deploy iOS application for iOS version 5.1.1 and above with xcode 7.p  pBut when I tried to run my iOS application project in Xcode 7 beta 4 then it shows error message  fembedbitcode is not supported on versions of iOS prior to 6.0p  pAnd for this error I found following predictions on googling, Xcode 7 has a ENABLEBITCODE option to embed bitcode in apps, app extensions, and frameworks. The option is turned on by default for iOS and is mandatory for watchOS projects submitted to the store. When bitcode is enabled for a target, all the objects, static libraries and user frameworks used when linking that target must contain bitcode. Otherwise, an error or a warning will be issued by the linker. Note missing bitcode is currently a warning for iOS, but it will become an error in an upcoming beta release of Xcode 7. ENABLEBITCODE should be consistently turned on for all the targets. If you use a library or framework provided by a third party, please contact the vendor for an updated version which contains bitcode.p  pThen tried to set ENABLEBITCODE  NO in Xcode 7 beta 4 But I cant find this option in Xcode 7 beta 4 under Build Settings of Project and Target of my iOS application project.p  pPlease help me I would like to know how to get option ENABLE Bitcode in XCODE 7 beta 4  p  pThanks in Advance.p

Does this mean the title has to be part of the form via the f.title syntax  I dont want to do this if possible because title is not part of the User model.  Its a separate property I want to use for something else inside the controller.p

Negative 279 pI have a master actor which processes messages by delegating them to its children and I want to find the optimal number of children that will process these messages the quickest. The number of children should change with time as the load on the server changes from other applications demanding resources. Are there some Routers or patterns to do this that are already popularp  pstrongEditstrong I have very specific needs to do this, each actor is responsible for taking care of a process it starts which does all the computationally intensive work, so the actors themselves are not doing any real work, they are there solely for concurrency. This is not a question so much as to optimizing akka itself, or code on the jvm, but rather how many instances of an application to run in parallel for the best performance. This is entirely dependent on how many workers there are. If there are more processors than available cores then I start to see a massive decrease in performance, which happens when other users start using the server my application is running on. Normally I wouldnt care about this sort of optimization, but the app is running a large number of simulations, which can take days, potentially months. This problem is extremely important in the field I work in Engineering where simulations can take forever. Normally you wouldnt be competing for resources like this but this is the situation in, which I have no control over.p  pPlease understand that none of the following is useful to me.p  ul liSuggestions to dedicate the server to my app only  I am not able to do this.li liTo throttle messages  The Processes themselves hog CPUs when idle, starting and killing them takes allot of cpu as well because they are connecting to other servers via tcpli ul  pFor the bounty answers must address how to naively control the number of actors in some manor which responds to the time to process the messages. The messages are always the same amount of work, so this is not a horrible strategy, though not the best but like I said, any small optimization is worth if for my case, whilst I understand in general this is not a great approach.p

Negative 279 pstrongtldrstrong How Is it possible to use a jar library, that uses Spring Boot for configuration in a non Spring Boot regular oldschool Spring server.p  pWe have the problem, that we have a Spring server, that is from the preBoot times and we want to create a new library for it. We would like to use Spring Boot in the library i.e. codeEnableAutoConfigurationcode for configuration. To include the library we have put an spring.xml into the library that enables codecomponentscancode inside the library. The classes inside the library use codeEnableAutoConfigurationcode and codeEnableWebSecuritycode to enable configuration and security.p  pIf we include now the library into our server and codeimportcode the XML file from the library into the servers XML file, only parts of the configuration are working. The codeRequestMappingcodes in the library are working and the interfaces are available. However Spring security fails to register its default filter chain, leading to ugly errors, where the regular Spring Boot config should already work with codeAnonymousAuthorizationFiltercode, etc.p  pWe debugged, that the codeFilterRegistrationBeancode in spring security is never configured when running that way and is, if we are running as a Spring Boot application.p  ul liSo is there a common way how to deal with Spring Boot enabled libraries inside oldschool Spring serversli liIs placing a single XML to enable componentscan in the library and importing this XML inside the main servers XML the correct way to include Spring Boot libraries and how would be the best way, if the server emwouldem use Spring Boot itselfli liDoes anyone know of the issue with a missing Spring Security filter chainli ul  pPS I know that we can add the required filters manually. However if we would do that, we would anyway get rid of Spring Boot completely in the library, so this question mainly aims for how to do it with Spring Boot. Of course if it is the wrong way to enable Spring Boot inside a library, please also mention that p

Negative 279 pIm developing a simple game in Java just to use as a toy program to teach some techniques for my students, but Im having some problem. My game uses two ArrayList that are iterated lots of times. These lists contains the projectiles that a ship fire and the targets that these projectiles can destroy. I need to constantly verify the colision between each projectile with each target in the screen among other things related to iterating throught these lists. I noted that while my program was running, the performance of it started to get worse and worse, so I started to profile the project Im using NetBeans profiler to find problems.p  pOne thing that I find is that using the for each of Java to iterate throught the lists implies calling iterator method inplicitly a lot of memory started to be used and not released.p  pI wrote the code below to test this. When I profile it, the ArrayListitr method memory consumption starts to grow and grow. The list has a fixed size, so I dont understand why the memory continues to grow, since I have the same data structure.p  pTake a look in the codep  precodeimport java.util.ArrayList import java.util.List  public class MemoryLeak       public static void main String[] args            ListltStringgt dummyData  new ArrayListltgt          long quantity  1000         long iterationTimeWithData  60000         long iterationTimeEmpty  10000          System.out.println adding data          for  int i  0 i lt quantity i               dummyData.add String.valueOf Math.random                     System.out.printf iterating through the list for d secondsn, iterationTimeWithData1000          long startTime  System.currentTimeMillis         while  true               for  String d  dummyData               if  System.currentTimeMillis  startTime gt iterationTimeWithData                   break                                System.out.println clear the list          dummyData.clear          System.out.printf iterating through the empty list for d secondsn, iterationTimeEmpty1000          startTime  System.currentTimeMillis         while  true               for  String d  dummyData               if  System.currentTimeMillis  startTime gt iterationTimeEmpty                   break                               codepre  pIf you run the code and keep track of ArrayListitr you will see that its memory consumption grows a lot during the execution time. In my game, this consumption is enormous more than 200 MB and keeps growing. Using a regular for, this does not occur. p  pI would like to know if this behavior is correct, because for me its very strange.p
