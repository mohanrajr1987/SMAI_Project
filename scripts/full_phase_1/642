Positive 642 h2What Im trying to doh2  pI have a web app hosted on Heroku, which uses Django, with the domain say codeexample.comcode. I wanted to make all incoming codehttpexample.comcode requests redirect to codehttpsexample.comcode.p  h2What Ive doneh2  pI set up a hrefhttpsdocs.djangoproject.comen1.8refmiddlewaredjango.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware relnofollowSecurityMiddlewarea in Django and set codeSECURESSLREDIRECTcode to be codeTruecode, which a hrefhttpsdocs.djangoproject.comen1.8refsettingsstdsettingSECURESSLREDIRECT relnofollowredirects all nonHTTPS requests to HTTPSa. This seems to work.p  h2The problemh2  pHeroku serves as a proxy to my Django app. So when the Heroku loadbalancer gets an HTTPS request, it probably routes to my web app using a nonHTTPS connection. Which freaks out my app, and it redirects it to HTTPS again, setting off a redirect loop.p  pa hrefhttpsdocs.djangoproject.comen1.8refsettingssecureproxysslheader relnofollowThe way to solve this seems to bea to set codeSECUREPROXYSSLHEADER  HTTPXFORWARDEDPROTO, httpscode as a setting in Django. This tells my app if the proxy sends the header HTTPXFORWARDEDPROTO, and if its value is https, then trust the connection. I tried this, and it works.p  pHowever, Im warned by the Django docs that I should make sure that my proxy strips incoming XFORWARDEDPROTO headers, which makes sense  if a malicious agent sends this header over a codehttpcode connection with an codehttpscode value my web app will be fooled.p  pstrongHow do I check if Heroku strips the codeXFORWARDEDPROTOcode header from incoming requestsstrongp

Positive 642 pAs I gather from e.g. a hrefhttpswww.owasp.orgindex.phpSessionManagementCheatSheet relnofollowOWASP session cheat sheeta, it is recommended to tie a user session identified by a session key to other user related data, e.g. the client IP address.p  pUsually, this is achieved by reading HTTP headers codeREMOTEADDRcode, but can be more sophisticated, see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions735350howtogetausersclientipaddressinaspnetthis SO questiona f.i. when proxy servers are involved.p  pMy web service is distributed over multiple web servers i.e. domains, sharing user session data across them.

I dont know, if that has something to do with the fact, that the website is served over HTTPS. p  pThe effect is, that the client IP extracted from the HTTP headers is different on different access domains. Therefore, the user looses the session when a different web server is accessed.p  pI would like to know, if there are best practices to handle this case. I see following optionsp  ul lidisable the client IP checkli liswitch to useragent as user identificationli ul  pBoth have some disatvantages, but maybe there are better solutionsp

Using , , [[, ]], , or  as movements all pretty much do the same thing, bringing you to the start above or on the def line or end after the last line of the function of the function.

Negative 642 pDo you know a program which gives you a list of all assembler mnemonics used by a given delbytedel machine code mainly for x86s beside their number of occurrences I dont mean something like a pure disassembler.

Negative 642 pIm having a problem and hope, someone knows whats going wrong and why and is able to give me the explanation of what Im missing out right now to make that thing work as suggested.p  pI have a JTree which is build upon a custom TreeModel WRTreeModel, see below. The data structure this model shall be used for is build of an root object which contains some fields and furthermore a list which is backed by the ArrayListModel shown below. The tree looks fine when I build it using the WRTreeModel. Im able to expand and collapse the nodes which represent the lists and fields contained in the objects. I can expand and collapse these lists and see their contents as well and so on.p  pNow I want to remove a child of one of the lists and  as I already know  do it by removing it from the model calling the remove method of the ArrayListModel. To make the WRTreeModel aware of that remove, the first thing is to call its fireIntervalRemoved method is called, so far so good.p  pIn the WRTreeModels inner class ArrayModelListener the intervalRemoved method prepares the call of fireTreeNodesRemoved which then builds a TreeEvent which is forwarded to all registered TreeModelListeners and therefore the JTree which registers itself automaticall when its connected to the model.p  pNow I would expect that the tree reflects the change and updates its internal and visual representation to show the new state. Unfortunately this doesnt seem to work that way. Something happens. But when I click on the node I just have changed some EventHandlerExceptions are thrown. Obviously something got really confused.p  pI know its not easy to answer such a question on the fly but I would really appreciate a fast answer. It would also be of help, if someone knew websites explaining the use of custom tree models not on DefaultMutableTreeNode or any given implementation based class and how the  event handling and updating of the JTree works.p  pWith best regards,p  pThomas Artsp  phrp  precodepublic class ArrayListModelltEgt extends ArrayListltEgt implements ListModel   ...  public E removeint index      fireIntervalRemovedindex, index     E removedElement  super.removeindex     return removedElement     ...   codepre  phrp  precodepublic class WRTreeModel extends LogAndMark implements TreeModel      class ArrayModelListener implements ListDataListener     ...

Negative 642 pThe application Im working on has an activity feed where each user can see their friends activity much like Facebook. Im looking for a moderately scalable way to show a given users activity stream on the fly. I say moderately because Im looking to do this with just a database Postgresql and emmaybeem memcached. For instance, I want this solution to scale to 200k users each with 100 friends.p  pCurrently, there is a master activity table that stores the rendered html for the given activity Jim added a friend, George installed an application, etc.. This master activity table keeps the source user, the html, and a timestamp.p  pThen, theres a separate join table that simply keeps a pointer to the person who should see this activity in their friend feed, and a pointer to the object in the main activity table.p  pSo, if I have 100 friends, and I do 3 activities, then the join table will then grow to 300 items.p  pClearly this table will grow very quickly. It has the nice property, though, that fetching activity to show to a user takes a single relatively inexpensive query.p  pThe other option is to just keep the main activity table and query it by saying something likep  precodeselect  from activity where sourceuser in 1, 2, 44, 2423, ... my friend list codepre  pThis has the disadvantage that youre querying for users who may never be active, and as your friend list grows, this query can get slower and slower.p  pI see the pros and the cons of both sides, but Im wondering if some SO folks might help me weigh the options and suggest one way or they other. Im also open to other solutions, though Id like to keep it simple and not install something like CouchDB, etc.p  pMany thanksp

I would appreciate others feedback and answers for something that may be more correct or efficient.p  pJust like the CLR codeBitArraycode, the codelengthcode field refers to the number of bits in the struct and the codearraycode field or codeArraycode property refers to the 32bit integer array that represents the bits.p  pstrong[CLARIFICATION]strong I have chosen to take the easy route in my constructors and other methods so that I cannot rely on the unnecessary bits being zeros. For example,p  ul licodeNotcode is implemented by bitwise negation codecode on the integer array elements.li liA constructor is available that takes a length and boolean to initialize all bits. If the initialization value is true, I set all elements of the int array to 1 in twos complement, represented by all 1sli liEtc.li ul  pThus, I need to handle or, rather, ignore them in the comparison.

Negative 642 pI am building an app that uses the fine Urban Airship api to send the user push notifications.p  pThe app keeps track of event dates that are added to the app by the user. This means I have no server in place for dealing with push, the app itself simply  schedules a push notification with Urban AS when the user add the event date and time.p  pIf the user decides to delete the event before it occurs I unschedule it with Urban AS. All is good. I, however, would like to not send notifications to a user that has disabled notifications as these notifications are no freep  pI know the Push Notification API from Apple makes sure the user will not receive any notification if they turned them off in settings. They will simply ignore the scheduled notifications Urban AS sends, which is a waste of bandwidth and money.p  pstrongHow can I tell if the user has disabled the notification for my appstrongp  pAlso, I see no other option than to test if the user has turned off notification and then tell Urban AS to cancel all notifications and if the user turns them back on, I will have to go through all events and rescheduled them  each time the app runs.p  pstrongCan anyone think of a way for me not to have to fill up my appDelegate with all kinds of conditional code for testing these scenariosstrong e.g. user has turned off push since last running the app, user has turned them on since last time.

Negative 642 pAll of our reports are created from object graphs that are translated from our domain objects.

Problem reproduced on multiple client machines with different Windows versions XP and 7. No performance problem using Chrome, Firefox, Opera, or Safari from same machine. No performance problem using other versions of IE 8 on other machines. Slow load causes virtually no CPU, memory, or IO spike on server or client machine. No performance problem on other sites using HTTPS on same client machine.p  pThe pages in question use JavaScript and innerHTML to replace the contents of div elements to create a collapsible menu, and an iframe to display some content.  A couple of the div elements contain images.  If I remove the iframe and the JavaScript, the performance issues go away.  However, rewriting the entire site to make these changes would be very time consuming.  Were in the process of replacing the whole site, but it may be 23 months before we do so and we really cannot live with this slowdown that long.

Negative 642 pI have a problem. Ive been installing my VSTO Outlook AddIn to the Outlook 2007 on the account that has no security limitations. For the setup, I am using a normal visual studio setup project. Ive had the user install few versions of my application before and it worked fine. Recently, Ive created a new version of my application which is installed to HKLM and to HKCU registry a hrefhttpsupport.microsoft.comkb976811 relnofollowhotfixa that allows me to install the addin to HKLM registry was also installed. Now the outlook addin doesnt even load on the users computer. If you look in OutlookTrust CenterAddins you will see my outlook addin showing up under Inactive Application Addins, but when I try to enable it, I get a message This addin is installed for all users on this computer, and can only be connected or disconnected by an administrator even though I am logged in as administrator. I also looked in the registry and it has LoadBehaviour as 3, which means that it should appear under active addins. I tried installing old version, but now it also doesnt work and does not even appear as installed Outlook addin. What can be a cause of this problemp  pThank youp

However, it hashes all of codePcode before doing a Hash join with the result of the first merge. codePcode is quite large and I think this is whats taking all the time. Why would it create a hash there codeP.idcode is codePcodes primary key, and codeA.Pidcode has an index of its own. p  pUPDATE All the datatypes are INTEGER, except codeA.sizecode which is a DOUBLE PRECISION and codeP.foocode which is VARCHAR.

There are a lot of places where the Fields property needs to be implemented, and sometimes a lot of fields, so its important for code clarity and maintenance that the code that emcallsem codeGetFieldInfocode be simple and clear duplicating the list of fields or duplicating the parameter would be just emaskingem for bugs where they get out of sync.p  pSo, how do I write codeGetFieldInfocode If I dop  precodepublic static IFieldInfoltTgt GetFieldInfoltTgtFuncltT, objectgt getter codepre  pthen I can implement codeGetValuecode trivially by calling codegetterobjcode but I have no way to access the name.p  pIf, on the other hand, I dop  precodepublic static IFieldInfoltTgt GetFieldInfoltTgtExpressionltFuncltT, objectgtgt getter codepre  pthen I can extract the name of the property access thats represented by the expression, but the only way to implement codeGetValuecode is to call codeCompilecode on the expression, which I imagine to be a ridiculous amount of overhead for something that the compiler itself could compile for me, especially since codeGetValuecode is used more often on these objects than codePropertyNamecode is.p  pIs there any way to write my codeGetFieldInfocode helper function to take a single parameter and interpret it as both an expression tree AND a delegate without the overhead of compiling the expression tree into a delegate at runtimep

Negative 642 pIm in the process of writing a C Wicket implementation in order to deepen my understanding of C and Wicket.  One of the issues were running into is that Wicket makes heavy use of anonymous inner classes, and C has no anonymous inner classes.p  pSo, for example, in Wicket, you define a Link like thisp  precodeLink link  new Linkid      Override     void onClick          setResponsePage...       codepre  pSince Link is an abstract class, it forces the implementor to implement an onClick method.p  pHowever, in C, since there are no anonymous inner classes, there is no way to do this.  As an alternative, you could use events like thisp  precodevar link  new Linkid link.Click  sender, eventArgs gt setResponsePage... codepre  pOf course, there are a couple of drawbacks with this.  First of all, there can be multiple Click handlers, which might not be cool.  It also does not force the implementor to add a Click handler.p  pAnother option might be to just have a closure property like thisp  precodevar link  new Linkid link.Click   gt setResponsePage... codepre  pThis solves the problem of having many handlers, but still doesnt force the implementor to add the handler.p  pSo, my question is, how do you emulate something like this in idiomatic Cp

Negative 642 pIm looking for a way to authenticate a user given a username and password via the Microsoft CRM 4.0 Web Services API. Ideally, Id like to filter down a list of projects based on which ones the logged in user has access to. i may be able to figure out the second part but I cant find a way to authenticate the user.

Negative 642 pstrongUPDATE 14 June 2011strongp  pA quick update... Most respondents have focused on the dodgy method for handling the queue of messages to be logged however while there is certainly a lack of optimisation there its certainly not the root of the problem.  We switched the Yield over to a short sleep yes, the Yield did result in 100 CPU once the system went quiet however the system still cant keep up with the logging even when its going nowhere near that sleep.  From what I can see the Send is just not very efficient.  One respondent commented that we should block up the Send together in to one send and that would seem like the most appropriate solution to the larger underlying issue and thats why I have marked this as the answer to the original question.  I certainly agree the queue model is very flawed though, so thanks for feedback on that and I have upvoted all answers that have contributed to the discussion.p  pHowever, this exercise has got us to review emwhyem were using the external logging over a socket like we are, and while it may well have made sense previously when the logging server did lots of processing over the log entries... it no longer does any of that and therefore we have opted to remote that entire module and go for a directtofile approach via some preexisting logging framework, this should eliminate the problem entirely as well as remove unnecessary complexity in the system.p  pThanks again for all the feedback.p  pstrongORIGINAL QUESTIONstrongp  pIn our system we have two components important to this problem  one is developed in Visual C and the other is Java dont ask, historic reasons.p  pThe C component is the main service and generates log entries.  These log entries are sent via a CSocketSend out to a Java logging service.p  pstrongThe problemstrongp  pPerformance of sending data seems very low.  If we queue on the C side then the queue gets backed up progressively on busier systems.p  pIf I hit the Java Logging Server with a simple C application then I can hammer it way faster then I will ever need to from the C tool and it keeps up beautifully.p  pIn the C world, the function that adds messages to the queue isp  precodevoid MyLoggerLogconst CStringamp buffer      struct timeb timebuffer     ftime64s amptimebuffer       CString message     message.Formatd03d,04d,srn, inttimebuffer.time, inttimebuffer.millitm, GetCurrentThreadId, LPCTSTRbuffer      CString queuedMessage  new CStringmessage     sendMessageQueue.pushqueuedMessage  codepre  pThe function run in a separate thread that sends to the socket isp  precodevoid MyLoggerProcessQueue      CString queuedMessage  NULL     whilesendMessageQueue.trypopqueuedMessage              if running                      break                  ConcurrencyContextYield           if queuedMessage  NULL              return          else              socket.SendLPCTSTRqueuedMessage, queuedMessagegtGetLength         delete queuedMessage       codepre  pNote that ProcessQueue is run repeatedly by the outer loop thread itself, which excluding a bunch of nonsense preamblep  precodewhileparentgtrunning      try              loggergtProcessQueue          catch...            codepre  pThe queue isp  precodeConcurrencyconcurrentqueueltCStringgt sendMessageQueue codepre  pSo the effect were seeing is that the queue is just getting bigger and bigger, log entries are being sent out to the socket but at a much lower rate than theyre going in.p  pIs this a limitation of CSocketSend that makes it less than useful for us A misuse of it Or an entire redherring and the problem lies elsewherep  pYour advice is much appreciated.p  pKind Regardsp  pMatt Peddlesdenp

Negative 642 pTotal noob here. p  pI am in the process of building my hobby website and feel that I could, with some hard work, create a fully functional site. However, I am rather stuck on modal popout window. p  pI understand the basics of getting one to work, i.e. download jquery or related java library, attach said library to webpage in the  section. Apply modal popout in similar way making sure to include the CSS for it.p  pI can get it to function in my site, so with Shadowbox I managed to get it to actually popout. Where I am stuck, with Shadowbox in particular, is actually putting stuff inside the modal popout. I am really only interesting putting text in the modal popout with maybe a link or small picture to compliment the text. p  pWhat is hindering me is my lack of knowledge. This may be either a lack of understanding with regards to class attributes or href attributes, or a lack of knowledge. The only progression I have made with this is simply because of the copy and paste, and some image path manipulation with Shadowbox. I am still horribly confused as to how the script activates, what tagsattributes I need to make to ensure data within a  is included in the modal popout window.p  pI would really like to have a modal popout like this a hrefhttptypedeskref.com relnofollowhttptypedeskref.coma but feel that this is far, far beyond me. p  pIn summary I dont know how to put textimages inside of a modal popout. I dont know how a modal popout is activated and how to ensure I can control what is kept inside of it. The reason why I say this is because the limited sucess I have had with Shadow box is because it has somehow managed to pick up everything that is on my site, images, links etc. So when the modal popout is opened, there is my site, in modal form.p  pThanks for taking the time to read this. I really appreciate any help or advice you can give me. Even a shove in the direction where such information can be located would be greatp  pp.s. I am using dreamweaver cs5p

This works, but should I be taking a completely different approach to this Heres exactly what Im doingp  pIve defined a HighChart class with several properties that I want to be able to change via Ruby e.g. chart title, data, etc. The example below which works only sets two of these properties, leaving the rest as defaultp  precode    get  do       chart  HighChart.newoptions                     titletext gt Test Title,                     seriesdata gt                                           Calvin gt [10, 2, 17],                     Hobbes gt [11, 14, 6]                                                                haml index     end codepre  pIm using Hamls javascript filter in the viewp  precodejavascript   chart.chartjs codepre  pSo far so good. The ugly part is the chartjs method. I have simply copied the full text of the HighChart javascript, pasted it in as a string, and then used Ruby interpolation to grab the variables from the HighChart object created in the controllerp  precode    def chartjs         chartjs         var chart1       document.readyfunction     chart1  new Highcharts.Chart       chart           renderTo renderto,          type charttype       ,       title           text titletext       ,       xAxis           categories xcategories       ,       yAxis           title              text ycategories                 ,       series [getdatajsseriesdata]           end codepre  pAnd just in case its helpful, heres the first part of the HighChart object class definitionp  precode    class HighChart attraccessor renderto, charttype, titletext, xcategories,                ycategories, seriesdata      def initializeoptions       self.renderto  options[renderto]  container       self.charttype  options[charttype]  bar       self.titletext  options[titletext]  Fruit Consumption       self.xcategories  options[xcategories]  [Apples, Bananas, Oranges]       self.ycategories  options[ycategories]  Fruit eaten       self.seriesdata  options[seriesdata]  Jane gt [1, 0, 4],                                                    Bobbert gt [5, 7, 3],                                                   Zach gt [10, 2, 1]                                                        end codepre

Based on the answer provided in my previouslyasked question, Ive written this working recursive algorithmp  precodepublic void Tester      var collection  new List  list1, list2, list3      var answer  GetStringCombinationscollection.ToList      answer.ForEachConsole.WriteLine   private IEnumerableltstringgt GetStringCombinationsListltListltstringgtgt collection       if the collection is empty, return null to stop the recursion     if collection.Any              yield return null           recurse down the list, selecting one letter each time     else              foreach var letter in collection.First                       get the collection sans the first item             var nextCollection  collection.Skip1.ToList               construct the strings using yield return and recursion             foreach var tail in GetStringCombinationsnextCollection                              yield return letter  tail                             codepre  pHowever, this code depends on codeyield returncode to work properly.

Negative 642 pOkay, the title is a mouthful and I think thats probably why it has been tough to find an answer through google or this site. It might just be that I dont know how to express the problem correctly but here goesp  pI have a series of methods in a codeSimpleOpenGLRenderercode class that all take a single argument that extends the codeModelcode class. So the idea is that depending on the type of model, the renderer will invoke the correct method that knows how to render it. Here is a simplified executable example based on the problemp  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt  class Model   class Cube  public Model   class Sphere  public Model   class Renderer    public     virtual void renderModelconst Modelamp model  0   class SimpleOpenGLRenderer    public     void renderModelconst Cubeamp model            printfRender the cube.n           void renderModelconst Modelamp model            printfThrow an exception, my renderer does not support the model type you have provided.n           void renderModelconst Sphereamp model            printfRender the sphere.n        int mainint argc, char argv    Cube cube   Modelamp model  cube   SimpleOpenGLRenderer renderer    renderer.renderModelcube   renderer.renderModelmodel  codepre  pThe output from the example isp  precodeRender the cube. Throw an exception, my renderer does not support the model type you have provided. codepre  pIt may seem obvious to a more seasoned C developer that this does not work as planned but it just doesnt make sense to me. At runtime I will not know the exact type of the codeModelcode passed to the renderer hence the attempted overloading to resolve it. Coming from a Java background, I have used this technique before and in Java the method called will be that which best matches the emruntimeem type of the argument. In C it seems to match to the compiletime type of the reference, even if that reference may end up being to a subclass that  to my mind  better matches another function.p  pUp until now I had taken this runtime type matching for granted. Does it simply not exist in C or am I going about this the wrong way Should I be doing something differently in C to achieve itp  pThanks,p  pGary.p

Negative 642 pCurrently writing some tests for my models.  I have one model called Blog, when a user creates a blog an observer posts a message to the newsfeed of the user.  One of my tests test that this is being done.

Any way to get around this Ive tried sleep but that doesnt seem to be working.p  pThis is the general design.p  pBlog is created Observer notices and creates a new Newsfeed and passes the new Blog object Newsfeeds on create gets triggered and it gets the correct newsfeed message by calling a method on the Blog object.

Instead, the text box simply goes blank.  Now, if I click a image which acts like a button that increases the length of a that scheduled activity by one day, the name appears for whatever reason.  Ive tried simply calling the function that increases the number of days, but it doesnt work.  For some reason, it would appear that only the user clicking the image button seems to make the new user name show up in the text box.  This is why I would like to simulate the user clicking the increase by 1 day image.p
Negative 642 pLets suppose I have a script that needs to log something on the server. I have an endpoint like codehttpmyServer.comrecordLogcode and I can hit that with some parameters and itll make a record. Some caveatsp  ul liI can control what the server returnsli liThis will happen millions of times per day.li liEfficiency is of utmost importance.li liThe script might be loaded from another server and within an iframe, so browser security issues are in play.li liI dont really care about the response at all. Even if theres a communication failure, Im not going to do anything about it.li liI cant do anything that affects the state of the rest of the page.li ul  pMy first thought was to make an ajax call  it seems like the modern, right way to do it. However, in some circumstances, that can trigger crossdomain security issues. p  pMy other idea is to load a 1x1 pixel image or an empty codeltscriptgtcode into memory. Something likep  precodevar i  new Image i.src  httpmyserver.comrecordLogfoobarampbazbuz  returns 1x1 gif codepre  porp  precode this is similar to ajaxp, I suppose var s  document.createElementscript s.type textjavascript s.src httpmyserver.comrecordLogfoobarampbazbuz  returns empty text file codepre  pIm pretty sure theres no need ever to put the image or script into the DOM. Merely setting the src causes the browser to make the request.p  pThese two are pretty similar. The general standard seems to be to use pixels, but I think thats a holdover. I would think an empty script would be slightly smaller to transfer. Any advantages of one or the otherp  pAny other ideas  methods Any hidden gotchas Im not thinking of such as, perhaps, ancient browsers that wouldnt work as expectedp

Negative 642 pAlright, so I think my program might have a memory leak. Its an SDL application, and it seems to have grown too large for me to manually pinpoint the leak. I searched around for a windows equivalent of Valgrind Im running Windows 7 x64 and using Visual Studio 2010, and eventually came across a hrefhttpvisualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com7c40a5d8dd354019a2afcb1403f5939c relnofollowVisual Leak Detectora. Unfortunately, it doesnt seem to want to generate ay output.p  pI set up another project, an empty console application, and set up VLD the same way as in my SDL app. Upon running the program, VLD worked perfectly and caught every memory leak that I threw at it. But in the SDL app, it just outputs Visual Leak Detector Version 2.2 installed. at the beginning of the debug session and nothing else, even when I intentionally created a memory leak right in the main function.p  pThe closest I can tell, it might have to do with SDL screwing with the program entry point. But thats just a guess. Is there any way to get VLD to work with SDLp

Negative 642 pI am using a jqgrid where Id like to use inline editing and mask the entry such that the user is prompted to enter hhmm where hh  hours and mm  minutes.  Im using the digitalBush masked jquery plugin.  The issue is that when I call it from initData, it overwrites the current data in that field.  I noticed that this behavior is different when you use a modal form to do the editing.  Does anyone have a solution for this issue Ill call the mask from any event, and Im happy to use any available plugin.  As far as I can tell, the jqgrid formatter does not provide a custom mask that guides the user entry in the format in which I need it.  Also happy to be wrong about that with a snippet of code to support it of course.p  pThanks so much in advance.p  pUpdate I managed to cobble together a demo of the problem Im having.  SO obviously strips out the html that I wanted to wrap this in so that it could be plugged in and run asis, so youll need to wrap this in some html to see it work.  Thanks again for the assistance.

Negative 642 pIve seen many web apps that implement progress bars, however, my question is related to the nonuploading variety.p  pMany PHP web applications phpBB, Joomla, etc. implement a smart installer to not only guide you through the installation of the software, but also keep you informed of what its currently doing. For instance, if the installer was creating SQL tables or writing configuration files, it would report this without asking you to click. Basically, sitbackandrelax installation.p  pAnother good example is with Joomlas Akeeba Backup formerly Joomla Pack. When you perform a backup of your Joomla installation, it makes a full archive of the installation directory. This, however, takes a long time, and hence requires updates on the progress. However, the server itself has a limit on PHP script execution time, and so it seems that eitherp  ol liThe backup script is able to bypass it.li liSome temp data is stored so that the archive is appended to if archive appending is possible.li liClient scripts call the servers PHP every so often to perform actions.li ol  pMy general guess not specific to Akeeba is with 3, that isp  pre Web page JS  POST fooinstaller.phpdoaction1 SESSIDfoo2 Server  ERRCODE SUCCESS Web page JS  POST fooinstaller.phpdoaction2 SESSIDfoo2 Server  ERRCODE SUCCESS Web page JS  POST fooinstaller.phpdoaction3 SESSIDfoo2 Server  ERRCODE SUCCESS Web page JS  POST fooinstaller.phpdoaction4 SESSIDfoo2 Server  ERRCODE FAIL Reason Configuration.php not writable Web page JS  Show error to user pre  pIm 99 sure this isnt the case, since that would create a very nasty dependency on the user to have Javascript enabled. p  pI guess my question boils down to the followingp  ul liHow are long running PHP scripts on web servers, of course handled and are able to stay alive past the PHP maximum execution time If they dont cheat, how are they able to split the task up at hand I notice that Akeeba Backup does acknowledge the PHP maximum execution time limit, but I dont want to dig too deep to find such code.li liHow is the progress displayed via AJAXPHP Ive read that people use a file to indicate progress, but to me that seems dirty and puts a bit of strain on IO, especially for live servers with 10,000 visitors running the aforementioned script.li ul  pThe environment for this script is where safemode is enabled, and the limit is generally 30 seconds. Basically, a restrictive, free 0 host. This script is aimed at all audiences will be made public, so I have no power over what host it will be on. And this assumes that Im not going to blame the end user for having a bad host.p  pI dont necessarily need code examples although they are very much appreciated, I just need to know the logic flow for implementing this.p

Negative 642 pFor a GPS tracking app, recording location signals with WIFI turned on results in really imprecise data or data with gaps.  p  pIve used the Reachability queries to detect if wifi is available prior to starting tracking.  The problem is that if when that query is made the wifi is enabled but not connected to a network, it shows that the internet is not reachable via wifi, but thats not an indication of if the setting is disabled in the settings app.  This means that if the user starts running and a connection is made midrun, theyll get a location signal from the wifi instead of the GPS or cell network.  Consequently the accuracy on those data points can be  10 meters so I want to skip that point. The issue is that on wifi theyll have a large blank period where their signal wasnt recorded.p  pSo how can I check if wifi is strongenabledstrong but disconnected  p  pIve read all the other reachability discussions I could find but this seems to be the one gap with lots of responses incorrectly suggesting that reachability solves this out of the box.p  p...and Im not going to strongrequirestrong wifi  just alert them to the fact that it is enabled so at some point in their workout their location data might be lost due to inaccuracy.p

Damn Is there a way to create just one layout with one folder of drawable and use something to scale layout in function of different screen size  Thank you This is an example of my main xml layoutp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt ltLinearLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid     androidorientationvertical androidlayoutwidthmatchparent     androidlayoutheightmatchparent androidbackgrounddrawablesfondogt     ltLinearLayout androidididlinearLayout2         androidlayoutheightwrapcontent androidlayoutwidthmatchparent         androidorientationverticalgt         ltLinearLayout androidididlinearLayout1             androidlayoutheightfillparent androidweightSum1             androidlayoutwidthfillparent androidorientationhorizontalgt             ltImageView androidlayoutheightwrapcontent androidididimageView1                 androidsrcdrawabletrovachiavicontatti androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent                 androidlayoutmarginTop15dp androidlayoutmarginLeft20dpgtltImageViewgt             ltImageButton androidididinfoButton                 androidbackgroundnull androidlayoutheight47dp                 androidlayoutmarginLeft5dip androidlayoutweight0.25                 androidlayoutmarginTop15dip androidsrcdrawableinfomini                 androidlayoutwidth47dpgt             ltImageButtongt         ltLinearLayoutgt     ltLinearLayoutgt     ltRelativeLayout         androidididrelativeLayout1         androidlayoutwidthmatchparent         androidlayoutheightwrapcontent gt         ltLinearLayout             androidididlayoutGif             androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent             androidlayoutheightwrapcontent             androidorientationvertical gt             lttrova.chiavi.sd.GIFView             androidlayoutgravitycenter              androidlayoutheight220dp androidlayoutwidth210dp androidididGIFSingle             androidlayoutmarginLeft40dpgtlttrova.chiavi.sd.GIFViewgt         ltLinearLayoutgt         ltLinearLayout             androidididlayoutBanner             androidlayoutwidthmatchparent             androidlayoutheightwrapcontent             androidlayoutalignParentLefttrue             androidlayoutalignParentToptrue             androidorientationvertical         gt             ltTextView                 androidididtestoBanner                 androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent                 androidlayoutheightwrapcontent                 androidtextMedium Text                 androidlayoutgravitycenter                 androidgravitycenter                 androidtextAppearanceandroidattrtextAppearanceMedium                  androidlayoutmarginTop10dp                 androidtextColorandroidcolorblack                 androidmaxLines2gt              ltImageView                 androidididBanner                 androidlayoutwidthmatchparent                 androidlayoutheight144dp                 androidlayoutgravitycenter                 androidsrcdrawableboxcodice                  androidlayoutmarginTop5dp              gt         ltLinearLayoutgt     ltRelativeLayoutgt     ltLinearLayout         androidididlinearLayout3         androidlayoutwidthmatchparent         androidlayoutheightwrapcontent         androidorientationvertical         androidlayoutmarginTop1dpgt         ltImageButton             androidididavviacerca             androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent             androidlayoutheightwrapcontent             androidbackgroundnull             androidsrcdrawablechiave             androidlayoutgravitycentergt         ltTextView             androidididtestoRicercaSingle             androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent             androidlayoutheightwrapcontent             androidgravitycenter             androidtextAppearanceandroidattrtextAppearanceMedium             androidtextColorandroidcolorblack              androidlayoutgravitycentergt     ltLinearLayoutgt ltLinearLayoutgt codepre

Negative 642 pI made a toy program to test Javas concurrency performance.

The program just figures out prime numbers from a range. A generic version is obtained by commenting line 4453, and it generates nearly perfect scalability.p  pHowever, when I uncommenting line 4453, which does simple computation locally, and adjust the variable codescode to a value big enough, scalability may disappear.p  pMy question is whether my toy program uses shared data which may result in degraded concurrency performance. And how to explain the disappeared scalability I think low level overhead, like garbage collection, causes that Any solution can solve problems like this casep

Negative 642 pIn my C .NET 4 application, I use codeWndProccode to process some messages mostly dealing with resizing the application to and from full screen.p  pRight now I am just handling codeSCMAXIMIZEcode and codeWMNCLBUTTONDBLCLKcode to determine if the window is being resized to or from a maximized state I know I dont need WndProc to handle codeSCMAXIMIZEcode, but codeFormResizecode didnt seem to fire for a codeWMNCLBUTTONDBLCLKcode message when I doubleclick on the applications title bar.p  pNow I noticed that if I Aero Snap the window to the top of the screen to maximize it, neither of the above messages are posted so certain logic is not applied when the window is maximized via Aero Snap.  I only want to handle the message if the window is snapped to the top of the screen rather than the right or left, or if a window is unsnappped from maximized position.p  pI couldnt find any of the window messages related to Aero Snap.  Does anyone know of any references for those messagesp

Negative 642 pSo we are trying to setup a Continuous Integration server at my company. What we need to do is svn update the working copy on the server, then build it, start the site using IIS express and then run WatinSpecflow tests on it. Im using rake inside of CCNet to automate all of this. We are running CCNet as a service and logging in as a build agent because svn uses our domain login credentials in order to authenticate. Ive been unable to call the command line svn update username user password pass because of this. Yet Watin needs to be run in an interactive mode, and the service wont let me . Im able to get it to work if we manually log on to the server and run ccnet as command line. Unfortunately the Build Agent also logs out of that user account, closing any command lines with it I dont know why they need it to do this but they do. So is it possible to run a service in interactive mode if its signed in as a userp

This is most likely because the action httpwww.MyCompany.comMyAppapiIMyCompanyMyAppServiceGetItems is incorrect or because the message contains an invalid or expired security context token or because there is a mismatch between bindings.

Negative 642 pIm making the transition from the Microsoft stack i.e. WPF to HTML5 so apologies in advance for the rather amateurish nature of this question. p  pThe topic at hand is HTML encoding and decoding.p  pConsider an HTML5 app making AJAX calls to a C backend via HTTP. The server returns JSONformatted data exclusively, always making sure to HTMLencode the JSON value fields using codeHttpUtility.HTMLEncodecode. p  pThe HTML5 client performs the same process in reverse. All data posted to the server is HTMLdecoded first using a simple JavaScript helper function. p  pAll potentially displayable string data in my HTML5 app is stored and passed from place to place in its HTMLencoded form. This scheme is working well for me. But today I discovered HTML5 text boxes and in doing so, noticed something odd. Text boxes dont seem to like encoded text.p  pIf I have a text box defined as suchp  precodeltinput idfestus typetextgt codepre  pand update it as followsp  precodefestus.valsomeEncodedString codepre  pthe text box shows the actual codes that are embedded into someEncodedString instead of converting those codes to the appropriate characters. I was surprised by this behavior as I assumed that browsers perform the proper escape code interpretation for all DOM elements. p  pIve tried to abstract away the problem by writing a helperwrapper for val called val2p  precode.prototype.val2functionnewVal     return newValundefined         iHub.Utils.encodeHTMLthis.val      getting value         this.valiHub.Utils.decodeHTMLnewVal   setting value  codepre  p[iHub.Utils is a library of helper functions that I wrote]p  pThe idea here is that val2 will appropriately encode the data retrieved from my text box when emgettingem the value, and decode it prior to emsettingem the value. This seems to work but I cant shake the feeling that I must have a fundamental misunderstanding of how encodingdecoding is supposed to work in HTML5.p  pIs it standard practice to encodedecode data when using text boxes Are text boxes special somehow in so far as they, unlike other common elements like codeltpgtcode and codeltselectgtcode, dont perform standard decoding when displaying an encoded input string p  pAgain, sorry if this is too basic. HTML5 and JavaScript are fairly new to me and my Intro to HTML5type books dont really discuss this topic in any depth.p

More like a chess board component.p  pIn the object explorer I can set certain properties. Most importantly I can set the grid dimensions how many cells acrossdown, but also options relating to drawing. Whether the cells should be square, the color of oddeven cells etc.p  pMy first version of this component had properties directly on the class, and when I changed a property, the designtime drawing was updated immediately. As the component grew, I wanted to organize my properties a little better, and introduced some options properties, like drawing options, behaviour options etc. After introducing this, the designtime drawing no longer updates like before. After changing a property, I have to click on the component for it to update. Can anyone tell me why this happensp  pHeres a stripped down version of the code. I hope it will explain the behaviourp  pPS This is my first component, even though Ive been using Delphi since 1997, so if anyone can spot anything stupid in the way Ive done it, please feel free to tell mep  precodeunit GridPaintBox  interface  type   TGridDrawOption  gdoSquareCells,gdoCenterCells,gdoDrawCellEdges,gdoDrawFocus   TGridDrawOptions  set of TGridDrawOption    TGridOptions  classTPersistent   private     FCellsX  integer     FCellsY  integer     FDrawOptions  TGridDrawOptions   public     constructor CreateaGridPaintBox  TGridPaintBox     procedure AssignSource  TPersistent override   published     property CellsX  integer read FCellsX write FCellsX     property CellsY  integer read FCellsY write FCellsY     property DrawOptions  TGridDrawOptions read FDrawOptions write FDrawOptions   end    TGridPaintBox  classTPaintBox   private     FGridOptions  TGridOptions     FFocusedX,     FFocusedY  integer     FOnFocusChanged TNotifyEvent      procedure CalculateSizeAndPosition      procedure DrawCellX,Y  integer     procedure DrawCells     procedure SetGridOptionsconst Value TGridOptions   protected     procedure MouseDownButton TMouseButton Shift TShiftState X, Y Integer override   public     constructor CreateaOwner  TComponent override     destructor Destroy override     procedure Paint override     procedure SetFocusX,Y  integer   published     property OnFocusChanged  TNotifyEvent read FOnFocusChanged write FOnFocusChanged     property Options  TGridOptions read FGridOptions write SetGridOptions   end  procedure Register  implementation  procedure Register begin   RegisterComponentsSamples, [TGridPaintBox] end  procedure TGridPaintBox.CalculateSizeAndPosition begin   lt...gt end  constructor TGridPaintBox.CreateaOwner TComponent begin   inherited   FGridOptions  TGridOptions.Createself end  procedure TGridPaintBox.DrawCellX, Y integer begin   lt...gt end  procedure TGridPaintBox.DrawCells var   X,Y  integer begin   CalculateSizeAndPosition    for Y  0 to FGridOptions.CellsY1 do     for X  0 to FGridOptions.CellsX1 do       DrawCellX,Y end  procedure TGridPaintBox.Paint begin   Canvas.Font  Font   Canvas.Brush.Color  Color   Canvas.Brush.Style  bsSolid   Canvas.FillRectRect0,0,Width,Height   DrawCells   if AssignedOnPaint then     OnPaintSelf  end  procedure TGridPaintBox.SetGridOptionsconst Value TGridOptions begin   FGridOptions.AssignValue   invalidate end  procedure TGridPaintBox.MouseDownButton TMouseButton Shift TShiftState X, Y Integer begin   SetFocusPixelToCellXX,PixelToCellYY   inherited end  procedure TGridPaintBox.SetFocusX, Y integer begin   if FocusedXX and FocusedYY then      exit    FFocusedX  X   FFocusedY  Y    if assignedOnFocusChanged then     OnFocusChangedself    invalidate end  constructor TGridOptions.CreateaGridPaintBox  TGridPaintBox begin   FCellsX  20   FCellsY  8   FDrawOptions  [gdoSquareCells,gdoCenterCells,gdoDrawCellEdges] end  procedure TGridOptions.AssignSource  TPersistent begin   if Source is TGridOptions then   begin     FCellsX  TGridOptionsSource.CellsX     FCellsY  TGridOptionsSource.CellsY     FDrawOptions  TGridOptionsSource.DrawOptions   end   else     inherited end  end. codepre

Negative 642 pMy aim is to build a Flex library that is compatible with clients both other libraries and Flex applications build on Flex versions ranging from 3.5B to 4.6. Also, Id like to be able to use functionality from as recent a version of Flex as possible in my library, although this is a secondary concern compared to compatibility.p  pstrongIs it necessary that I use a Flex version no greater than 3.5Bstrongp  pA particular difficulty Im running into with 3.5B is when I statically link Flex into my library and use it in a Flex 4.5.1A project, it fails with a smrgsbord of compile time errors like code1044 Interface method get baseline in namespace mx.coreILayoutElement not implemented by class panelsBasePanel.codep  pRuntime shared linking appears to somewhat address the issue. When I compile the library for Flex 3.5B with RSL of Flex set, it produces a swc that compiles cleanly in my 4.5.1A project and basically works, but Im uncomfortable with the fact that the static option doesnt work. I feel that runtime linking in this way seems odd since a project built with Flex 3 is runtime linked with Flex 4 any why doesnt the runtime linking produce the same interface complaints.p  pRuntime linking appears so squishy namely, I can even build my original project with 4.6 and just be super careful not to use pre4.6 functionality and use it in a 3.5 project, that Im uncomfortable with it with my current level of understanding.p

Negative 642 pIve got a service that runs scans of various servers. The networks in question can be huge hundreds of thousands of network nodes.p  pThe current version of the software is using a queueingthreading architecture designed by us which works but isnt as efficient as it could be not least of which because jobs can spawn children which isnt handled wellp  pV2 is coming up and Im considering using the TPL. It seems like it should be ideally suited.p  pIve seen a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4740495maxtasksintplthis questiona, the answer to which implies theres no limit to the tasks TPL can handle. In my simple tests Spin up 100,000 tasks and give them to TPL, TPL barfed fairly early on with an OutOfMemory exception fair enough  especially on my dev box.p  pThe Scans take a variable length of time but 5 minstask is a good average.p  pAs you can imagine, scans for huge networks can take a considerable length of time, even on beefy servers.p  pIve already got a framework in place which allows the scan jobs stored in a Db to be split between multiple scan servers, but the question is how exactly I should pass work to the TPL on a specific server.p  pCan I monitor the size of TPLs queue and say top it up if it falls below a couple of hundred entries Is there a downside to doing thisp  pI also need to handle the situation where a scan needs to be paused. This is seems easier to do by not giving the work to TPL than by cancellingresetting tasks which may already be partially processed.p  pAll of the initial tasks can be run in any order. Children must be run after the parent has started executing but since the parent spawns them, this shouldnt ever be a problem. Children can be run in any order. Because of this, Im currently envisioning that child tasks be written back to the Db not spawned directly into TPL. This would allow other servers to work steal if required.p  pHas anyone had any experience with using the TPL in this way Are there any considerations I need to be aware ofp

Negative 642 pIm a little unsure of how to ask this question, so Ill start as best I can from where Im at.  I have a data type, Ill call it program, that I load some core information from a single data source.  I have my loading  caching logic worked out for the central data model, but there are externally loaded nodes that my framework will need to append to the data model based on project settings.p  pWhat Im looking for is a design pattern that will allow me to load these appended data nodes if the project requires it and to not execute the program until all the data has loaded.  I can assume that I will know what the nodes will be in advance and where to get the data when they are required.  My current setup looks something like belowp  precodevar programs  ,     loadCuePoints  function uuid, callback          will call the callback with the data once loaded and add the program         to programs, keyed by the uuid     ,     loadLinkedFiles  function uuid, callback          will append the data to programs[uuid] and call the callback with the         data once loaded     ,     loadProgram  function uuid, callback          will append the data to programs[uuid] and call the callback with the         data once loaded     ,      hash where the key is the node on program and the value is the function      used to load the data, this will be based on project settings, but Im not      concerned with this logic for this question     requiredData           cuePoints  loadCuePoints,         linkedFiles  loadLinkedFiles     ,     getProgram  functionuuid, callback          if programs[uuid]              callbackprograms[uuid]          else              assume the key in the requiredData hash is the required node on             Program, and that the value is the callback method, the functions             in this table sre already set up to load the data and return it             via the callback once loaded               codepre  pI can certainly hack my way through this, so Im not asking for a solution so much unless you have something that works very well or is particularly elegant as Im asking if theres an established pattern for queuing a callback after a collection of asynchronous actions.  Im happy to elaborate if the explanation is unclear.p

Negative 642 pYou are given a logic circuit that can be modeled as a rooted treethe leaves are the primary inputs, the internal nodes are the gates, and the root is the single output of the circuit. Each gate can be powered by a high or low supply voltage. A gate powered by a lower supply voltage consumes less power but has a weaker output signal. You want to minimize power while ensuring that the circuit is reliable. To ensure reliability, you should not have a gate powered by a low supply voltage drive another gate powered by a low supply voltage. All gates consume 1 nanowatt when connected to the low supply voltage and 2 nanowatts when connected to the high supply voltage.p  pDesign an efficient algorithm that takes as input a logic circuit and selects supply voltages for each gate to minimize power consumption while ensuring reliable operation.p  pIn this question what I think is that, it can solve solve by using greedy or Dynamic.

Negative 642 pI have many data types which are very similar, except for a small number of columns which logically have different names but the same data types. I want to store everything in one table.p  pRight now my idea is simply to give a generic name to some of the columns e.g. customdata1 etc. and in a different table remember for each data type what its column names are. This should work, but I wonder if theres a more structured way that will make queries easier and will feel less dirty to achieve the same effect in MySQL or SQLite.p

Negative 642 pI am little confused over the execution plan of an Oracle query. This is in Oracle Enterprise Edition 11.2.0.1.0 on platform IBM AIX 6.1. I have a table TEST1 1 million rows and another table TEST2 50,000 rows. Both tables have identical columns. There is a view created as a union of these 2 tables. I am firing a query on this view, with an indexed column in the WHERE clause. What I could find is that the index is not used and a full table scan is resulted. With a slight modification of the query, it started using the index. I am wondering how this particular change can result in the plan change.p  pPlease find the complete DDL  DML below. I have given simplified example. Actual schema and requirements are bit more complex. In fact the query in question is dynamically constructed and executed by an OCI code generator. My intention here is not to get alternatives, but to really understand what could be the logical reasoning behind the plan change between, I am an application programmer and not a database administrator.

Negative 642 pI use SmartSVN as a frontend for Subversion. Occasionally, a source file that that is under repository control becomes redundant  I simply no longer need it.

Negative 642 pIm using Symfony2 with Doctrine. I have tons of entities tables and heres what Im trying to accomplishp  pstrongPROBLEMstrongp  pEvery entity needs to have 2 fields columns, for example codefromdatecode and codetodatecode by default. Suppose I have the following entity defined in the codeproduct.orm.ymlcode filep  precodeSomeRandomNamespaceProduct     type entity     table product     id         id             type integer             generator                 strategy AUTO     fields         name             type string             length 255         description             type text         price             type float codepre  pAfter I would run codedoctrineschemaupdatecode the created table should already have codefromdatecode and codetodatecode columns. Now, lets say Im trying to fetch all the products from the database. I would do it like sop  precodeproducts  thisgtgetDoctrinegtgetRepositorySomeRandomBundleProductgtfindAll codepre  pThis would normally fetch ALL the products from the database. What I would like to do, is to fetch only products where codefromdatecode lt codesomedatecode lt codetodatecode. There would be a function codegetSomeDatecode that Doctrine would have to call in order, to get the value of codesomedatecode. Not that it should also work with custom queries written in DQL or if I do something like thisp  precodeproducts  thisgtgetDoctrinegtgetRepositorySomeRandomBundleProductgtfindByPrice20 codepre  pHowever, it should not affect cases, where I try to fetch the entity by its PK using the find method or custom DQL query.p  pstrongADDITIONAL DETAILSstrongp  pThere would also be some entities, that would not follow the above rules.p  pI know I could create codefromdatecode and codetodatecode in every entity  perform the check, but since there will be thousands of queries in the application it would only make code less readable.p  pstrongGOALstrongp  pThe goal of the above is to allow user, to see the state of the application as it was, anywhere in the past. If you know a different approach that can achieve the same goal it would also be great.p  pThank you for your timep

Negative 642 pSo Im wondering if anyone has any insight as to how I can create a tightening rubber band effect as the user pulls down. I was using an exponential equation that didnt work very well.

Though it worked, it would reverse direction if pulled too far.

I also read this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4607425dependencyinjectionwithninjectmvc3andusingtheservicelocatorpatternDependency Injection with Ninject, MVC 3 and using the Service Locator Patterna which discusses the issue as well.p  pHowever, my question concerns this particular casep  precodepublic class MyController      public void GetData              using var repository  new Repository                       Use the repository which disposes of an Entity Framework              data context at the end of its life.                     Lots of other methods.  codepre  pHere I have a controller which contains a method that calls a repository which automatically instantiates an internal Entity Framework data context. This single data context is used, because the context is called by every method in the repository so it seems to make sense to share a single context for the entire lifetime of the repository object.p  pNow, as the controller class is large, there is a greater chance than not that this given repository will not be used. As I assume perhaps incorrectly that this instantiating a DC is an expensive operation, I would prefer to avoid doing so. Using the service locator pattern allows me to defer instantiation until the context is actually needed, but given the valid arguments against it in the above links, I would prefer to avoid it.p  pSo what I would like to know is if there is a more efficient way of using dependency injection in the above case that would prevent me from instantiating my repository and underlying data context unnecessarily.p

Negative 642 pIm trying to use the codeSimpleMembershipProvidercode with SQLite to enable authentication on my site.

The question is how do I get the codeSimpleMembershipProvidercode to work with codeInt64code values I had a look at the source code for the offending routines listed in the stack trace and it seems that all numbers are being explicitly cast before being returned from their codeInt32code functions. However, I dont have the source to codeSystem.Dynamic.UpdateDelegates.UpdateAndExecute1code or codeCallSite.Targetcode, so I cant see what is going on there. What is more, those are probably precompiled. So, the question remains, how can I get this to workp

Negative 642 pWhat is the bestcleanest way to use namespaces in packaged codep  pE.g. in libraries like strongbooststrong there seem to be very organized namespaces management, some techniques are used that allow to disambiguate names.

Also, the assumption is that the project is indeed very big and needs proper namespaces for classes in each of the folders.p  pHow would you apply namespaces in such a project Say I declare all classes in reusable in namespace codereusablecode. Should I put interfaces from reusableif into namespace codereusablecode or into codereusableifcode Or maybe into none since it is used by component1 and component2p  pWhat about namespaces in component1 and component2 Anything to remember What about keyword codeusingcode Lets say that I decide to add this codereusableifcode namespace.

Specifically, for every unit test i need to care about all the validation logic even while i am testing other parts of the model  i can never fully isolate what i want to test by following the suggested approach. li ul  pstrongMy Thinking So Farstrongp  pAlthough the following constructor openly declares the dependencies of Pojo and preserves its simple testability, it is completely unsafe. There is nothing here to prevent the client providing a validator which claims every input is acceptablep  precodepublic PojoValidator businessLogic, String p throws InvalidFoo, InvalidBar      this.p  businessLogic.validatep  codepre  pSo, i restrict visibility of the constructor somewhat, and i provide a factory method which ensures validation then constructionp  precodeVisibleForTesting PojoString p      this.p  p   public static Pojo createPojoString p throws InvalidFoo, InvalidBar      Validator businessLogic  new BusinessLogic     businessLogic.validatep     return new Pojop  codepre  pNow i could refactor createPojo into a factory class, that would restore single responsibility to Pojo and simplify testing of the factory logic, not to mention the performance benefits of no longer wastefully creating a new stateless BusinessLogic on every new Pojo.p  pMy gut feeling is that i should stop, ask for an outside opinion.

When using firefox, this was not the case and it was only called once. What could be causing thisp  pTo note, this is only on my dev machine. I compile and run the code, open firefox, browse to codehttplocalhost63893code and it hits codeSessionStartcode. While browsing in firefox it only hits codeSessionStartcode once.p  pWhen I open chrome and browse to codehttplocalhost63893code it hits codeSessionStartcode. Then I enter my login data and hit login, and it hits codeSessionStartcode another time, and then it hits codeSessionStartcode emanotherem time while loading the get request for the next page. I used a counter to see, and in fact 3 unique sessions were created during that time.p  pI know that there are some sources which state that a Session is abandoned when no value is stored in it. That would be a fine explanation here for me, but it is not the case. I disproved this from two methods.p  pMethod 1p  precodeprotected void SessionEnd breakpoint codepre  pNever fired, and I can confirm that the old sessions are still present.p  pMethod 2p  pUsed codeSession[KeepAlive]  truecode inside of codeSessionStartcode to see if that would prevent codeStartcode from being called but it did not. codeEndcode was still not called.p  pWhat is so different between the two or what have I done wrongp

Negative 642 pI recently started a new Grails project and Im trying to use the scaffold feature as much as I can.

Negative 642 pIf I have a ButtonClick event which sets Cursor  crHourglass, Application.ProcessMessages, then use a TOpenDialog to choose a file, and then do something CPUintensive, the cursor behaves differently depending on whether it is over the existing control when the Open Dialog closes. If the cursor is over the control then the cursor remains as an hourglass if its outside the application completely and then moved into the area while the intensive process is still taking place, the cursor remains as an arrow. One cannot click or do anything so its confusing to the user to get an arrow but not be able to do anything with it.p  pStepping through the debugger shows the Cursor is 11 everywhere it should be.

This function has the proper signature, and calls a function I pass in via template argument.p  precodeampluaCallerltmyFuncgt codepre  pMy problem arises when I try to wrap this in another function.  Nontype template parameters must be externally linked, and thus the following failsp  precodevoid pushFunctionluaState  luaState, void fvoid      luapushcfunctionluaState, ampluaCallerltfgt  codepre  pWhich makes sense, because the address of the function needs to be known at compile time.  You cant throw in just any pointer and expect the compiler to know which classes to create.  Unfortunately, if I add a function pointer that emisem known at compile time it still fails.  The value of the function pointer is being copied into a, and therefore a is still technically not known at compile time.  Because of this, I would expect the following to workp  precodevoid pushFunctionluaState  luaState, void const fvoid      luapushcfunctionluaState, ampluaCallerltfgt  codepre  por maybep  precodevoid pushFunctionluaState  luaState, void amp fvoid      luapushcfunctionluaState, ampluaCallerltfgt  codepre  pIn the first case, because the value isnt allowed to change, we know that if it is externally linked, it will still technically be externally linked.  In the second case its being passed in as a reference, which would mean it should have the same linkage, no  But neither of these attempts work.  Why  Is it possible to circumvent this somehow  How can I cleanly auto generate a function that calls another functionp

Negative 642 pIm not the most experienced Javascript programmer, and have recently started a webapp project that is larger than the scope of stuff that Im used to mostly used to doing company websites, etc.p  pThe JS that runs the app has become unmanageable as a single file, so I decided it would be better to split it up into smaller functions and use gruntJS to concatenate everything together for me.p  pI have been using the modular design pattern on the main app, but Im a little confused now that Ive split it up into smaller chunks.

Negative 642 pFor a very securityintensive web application, it is feasible to encrypt all vital data sent back and forth between client and server using 2048bit RSA encryption Assuming there are kilobytes to megabytes of data being sent back and forth before encryption, what would be the performance loss of using this type of encryptionp  pLastly, how would I I can write the code if I have a general model have the server send servertoclient decryption keys and decryption engines to the client without compromising security for the current and future sessions i.e. another user of the same application will not be able to intercept the data from the first user and use the information stored on their computer from their session for decryption of the first users data, and a badintentioned person will also not be able to intercept and use the first users decryption keys and engines to accomplish the same taskp

Negative 642 pI am currently practicing my coding by writing a simple login script containing a counter session variable that increases by 1 every time a login attempt fails. Once there are 3 failed logins, the login page will automatically direct the user to an error page with a timer counting down to when he can try logging in again.Once the timer hits 0, the counter session variable will be clearedreset to 0 and the user can try logging in again.p  pI have written the login page with the session variable, but im currently stuck at the error page as i have no idea how to go about writing the timer.Im torn between using PHPwith TIMESTAMP or JavascriptJQuery.p  pstrongQuestionstrongp  p1.What are the advantagesdisadvantages of both PHP andor JavascriptJQueryp  p2.Im currently not tracking login attempts in my database, should i be doing sop  pThanks P.S Im currently using Uniform Server ,MYSQL p

Negative 642 pFor the simulation of moving obstacles in a fluid I need to calculate the intersecting volume of a parallelepiped and a cube as well as arbitrary polyhedron and a cube.  I am using Nefpolyhedron of the CGAL library.  Since I have to do around 90.000 intersection in each of the 10.000 timesteps, I have the major problem that it is too slow. In my implementation it takes 20 minutes for the 90.000 intersections. p  pIts practically impossible for me to do the simulation like this. In one second, 100 time steps should be possible to be carried out.  Is this a limitation of cgal, the problem or due to my bad programming Can someone tell me how fast it should be and if there is a faster simple way to calculate intersectionsp

Negative 642 pI am trying to keep track of a particular counter as I run through a series of loops.p  pEssentially I am looping over some input files, during which some calculations are done on each file. Outside the file loop I have declared an array to keep track of a particular set of integers, which are all zero for the first file but then get added too as calculations with successive files are done. When I try to update this tracker array it segfaults halfway through there are several elements for each file on all but the first file runthrough. See code belowp  pThe array in question is originally initialized herep  precodeint TempRowLength  new int[PrimeDatL] forint i0iltPrimeDatLi   TempRowLength[i]0   codepre  pand the segfault occurs in the following sectionp  precodeint tempArrayN coutltltBegin pHi2 compltltendl forint j0jltPrimeDatLj   int i0   tempArrayNTempRowLength[j]1   coutltlttempArrayNltltendl   whileiltPHLengths[n]         tempArray1[0][j]PrimeDat1[j]     ifpHi1[0][i]PrimeDat1[j]ampamptempArrayN1ltPrimeDat2[j]        tempArray1[tempArrayN][j]pHi1[1][i]       tempArrayN          i      TempRowLength[j]TempRowLength[j]tempArrayN  codepre  pThe error occurs when I include the final line where I increase the value of TempRowLength. This does not happen if this declaration occurs earlier, but that makes it useless.

Negative 642 pI began to use stackmob for Android development. And I went into an issue. Indeed after creating the interface for the user to log in, I wanted my home page to prompt the actual loggedin users name on the top of it.p  pSo I used the getloggedInUser ClassltT, stackMobCallBackltT for getting my user. The first issue was that I was not able to get this user outside of the call back. So I created a method that I call from the getloggedin user methods callBack. There I went into another issue the action from the method had no impact on my view. Indeed when the homepage prompts, the text remain the same without adapting itself to the logged in user.

Negative 642 pI am having a problem in including an eps file generated by matplotlib into a LaTeX document.

It seems that the LaTeX recognizes the figure to have a smaller size than the actual size. p  pFigure 2. is the same eps file as Figure 1., but the codebbcode parameters were specified in codeincludegraphicscode command in the LaTeX document.

Negative 642 pI have two versions of a dll. v11.3.3.0 and 11.4. The only difference is they in turn reference different versions of DevExpress dlls. Neither dll is located in the GAC.p  pThe v11.3.3.0 dll is located in a directory named bin off my main applications root directory. It is used by several programs located in that root directory.p  pThe v11.4 dll is located in the bin directory off the asp.net application which in turn is located in a subdirectory located of the main applications root directory.p  pThe webforms application generally initially loads the v11.4 dll correctly however after it is served up a few times, the webforms application begins to use the v11.3.3.0 version.p  pHow do I force the asp.net application to only use the v11.4 versionp

Negative 642 pI need to enable or disable a button depending on whether at least a row is selected in the list or not.p  pBelow is the code to reproduce this issue. The list is populated using the OnData event and it allows multiple rows to be selected.p  pI thought that I could use OnSelectItem to detect when the user changes the selection and then use the TListView SelCount function to detect the number of selected rows.p  pThe problem is that SelCount returns 0 when the user selects multiple rows. This works fine if the list is populated manually i.e. not through the OnData event.p  pAny ideasp  pThanksp  pUpdate using the OnChange event instead seems to do the trick.

At first it takes 4 seconds for the map to show these 2000 markers. but each time after loading the map again  like changing orientation or changing the drawermenu item and backing to the map again  it takes more and more to load the markers. for example after 8 times changing the orientation, it takes 40 seconds for the map to load the same 2000 markers p  phere is how I initialize the map p  precode        googleMap  MapFragment getFragmentManager.findFragmentByIdR.id.map.getMap         CameraPosition cameraPosition  new CameraPosition.Builder.target new LatLng50.941303, 6.958166.zoom10.build         googleMap.moveCameraCameraUpdateFactory.newCameraPositioncameraPosition           check if map is created successfully or not         if googleMap  null              Toast.makeTextgetActivity.getApplicationContext,                     Sorry unable to create maps, Toast.LENGTHSHORT                     .show          codepre  pand here I add the markers to the map p  precode    for int i  0 iltmapVehicles.size i               latitude and longitude         double latitude  mapVehicles.geti.latitude         double longitude  mapVehicles.geti.longitude           create marker         MarkerOptions marker  new MarkerOptions.positionnew LatLnglatitude, longitude                 .titlemapVehicles.geti.lineTripIdentification.snippetdestinationShort     mapVehicles.geti.destination           Changing marker icon         marker.iconBitmapDescriptorFactory.fromResourceR.drawable.vehicleannotation           adding marker                     vehicleMarkers.putgoogleMap.addMarkermarker, mapVehicles.geti        codepre  pI also used the following in the onCreateView of the Fragment which has the MapFragment p  precodethis.setRetainInstancetrue codepre  pany help would be much appreciated p

Negative 642 pRecently Ive read a hrefhttpblog.ploeh.dk20100203ServiceLocatorisanAntiPatternMark Seemanns articlea about Service Locator antipattern.p  pAuthor points out two main reasons why ServiceLocator is antipatternp  ol lipstrongAPI usage issuestrong which Im perfectly fine withbr When class employs a Service locator it is very hard to see its dependencies as, in most cases, class has only one PARAMETERLESS constructor. In contrast with ServiceLocator, DI approach explicitly expose dependencies via constructors  parameters so dependencies are easy seen in IntelliSence.pli lipstrongMaintenance issuestrong which puzzles mebr Consider the following expample  pli ol  pWe have a class emMyTypeem which employs a Service locator approach  p  precodepublic class MyType      public void MyMethod              var dep1  Locator.ResolveltIDep1gt         dep1.DoSomething       codepre  pNow we want to add another dependency to class MyTypep  precodepublic class MyType      public void MyMethod              var dep1  Locator.ResolveltIDep1gt         dep1.DoSomething           new dependency         var dep2  Locator.ResolveltIDep2gt         dep2.DoSomething       codepre  pAnd here is my misunderstanding start. Author says p  blockquote   pIt becomes a lot harder to tell whether you are introducing a breaking change or not. You need to understand the entire application in which the Service Locator is being used, and the compiler is not going to help you.p blockquote  pBut wait a second, if we were using DI approach, we would introduce a dependency with another parameter in constructor in case of constructor injection. And the problem will be still there. If we may forget to setup ServiceLocator, then we may forget to add a new mapping in our IoC container and DI approach would have the same runtime problem.p  pAlso, author mentioned about unit test difficulties. But, wont we have issues with DI approach Wont we need to update all tests which were instantiating that class We will updated them to pass a new mocked dependency just to make our test compilable. And I dont see any benefits from that update and time spending.p  pIm not trying to defend Service Locator approach. But this misunderstanding make me think that Im losing something very important. Could somebody dispel my doubtsp  pstrongUPDATE SUMMARYstrongp  pThe answer for my question Is Service Locator antipattern really depends upon the circumstances. And I definitely wouldnt suggest to cross it out from your tool list. It might be become very handy when you start dealing with a legacy code. If youre lucky enough to be at the very beginning of your project then DI approach might be a better choice as it has some advantages over Service Locator.p  pAnd here is main differences which convinced me to not use Service Locator for my new projectsp  ul liMost obvious and important Service Locator hides class dependenciesli liIf you are utilizing some IoC container it will likely scan all constructor at startup to validate all dependencies and give you immediate feedback on missing mappings or wrong configuration this is not possible if youre using your IoC container as Service Locatorli ul  pFor details read excellent answers which are given below.p

Because actually ResourceConfig is not a Servlet. I will explain this issue nowp  pI have extended ResourceConfig.class, which is a subclass of an Application.class. This Application class is not an extended Java servlet, but an own class of Jersey. I though an Application is called on the startup of the web container. However, in the Jersey specification can be read, that the Application class needs to be itself handled by a ServletContainer.class which is a subclass of a Java Servlet. This handling is defined in the web.xml. And in the end, everything is a servlet here.p  pAs its not possible to get the port on startup, its of course possible when a request is dispatchedp  precodePathexample public class ServletMethods      GET     public Response exampleHeaderParamHost String host           return Response.okhost.build       codepre

Negative 642 pI have problem with classification using SVM. Lets say that I have 10 classes, digts from 0 to 9. I can train SVM to recognize theese classes, but sometimes I get image which is not digt, but SVM still tries to categorize this image. Is there a way to set threshold for SVM on the output maybe as I can set it for Neural Networks to reject bad images May I ask for code sample in C or Python with opencv Thanks in advance.p

Negative 642 pI need to save some table content in my html page frame by clicking a button. After that in Save as dialog box I want to select a file name and save it somewhere..

But how to do this Which technology to prefer Of course it needs to support most popular browsers. And somehow I need to show Save as dialog to the user to allow himher to select the file location.p

Negative 642 pI am writing a small Python script that makes heavy use of threads  multiple processes and I came across an interesting race condition that I cannot find an explanation for.

When called the codeplaycallbackcode would call codesetcode on the codemusicstoppedcode Event for the next song.p  pSo my question is when the codeplaycallbackcode function is called is it merely going to the enclosing scope and looking for an object with the name musicstopped Or is the underlying cause something elsep

Negative 642 pIm trying to load a temporary image tag. Once that tag is done loading the image, I will set the src for the imgmain to the src of the temporary image element.  The thing is, the temporary image is successfully loading it shows up on the screen, but the onload handler doesnt seem to fire. I never get my Image is done loading msg.  I dont see how the temporary image can show up on the page, but not trigger its onload handler would this happen if the browser is using a cached version of the image But, Im pretty sure I cleared the cache, anyway..  By the way, Ive also tried code like B below. But that didnt seem to work either.  Also, Im using Aptana Studio and loading my pages into my local WAMP server.  I dont know if that makes any difference. Also, the urls that Im assigning to the src are document relative like imagesimage1.jpg.p  pI would appreciate any advice anyone might have.

Negative 642 pI need to run some tests for an emulator we are using, and for that I need to test the specified RTT delay. Sometimes RTT delay will get 10x more, and at those times, I need to test if in reality that is correct. For instance if the emulators log says at time X the RTT is set to 400ms, then I can see verify that using real application which is connected to the emulators network. The best way to do that is using ping with timestamps.

Negative 642 pIm quite new with actionscript, and have been scrapping together a little test game to sort of get used to the language, get my feet wet. The premise behind the game is pretty average, I have a character that can move in 8 directions, can pick up several keys that are randomly placed, and open a door when he possesses a key. p  pThe problem comes in to play with the bullet shooting. I dont know much about trigonometry, so when a key is pressed, i just use the .rotate property to turn the player. I pass the .rotate integer into my bullet class and use that to tell which direction the bullet should travel. It works perfectly for the up, down, and right movements, but when the character is facing left the bullet is created but has no velocity whatsoever, and for the life of me I cannot figure out where the error in the code is. p  pIf someone could look over my code and help me out, I would be much appreciated. Im sure its something simple that Im just missing.

Negative 642 pIm working on a c MFC project that makes use of the Multiple Document Interface and was originally created about 10 years ago. Ive managed to port it to Visual Studio 2013, but Im getting stuck on updating the GUI to something more modern like the ribbon design without having to copy the code to a newly created project.p  pIve researched a few links, like the scribble example from Microsoft and a hrefhttpchristophep.wordpress.com20131213implementingafullribboninanativeapplicationmore relnofollowthis linka but they all seem very vague and hard to follow. Should I bite the bullet and create a new project with the ribbon design GUI or is there a smarter way to get a modern MFC based GUIp

Negative 642 pI have two Orchard Modules.p  pBoth have implementations of codeIAppSettingscode , which is defined in an external dll, and referenced in  the modules via nuget package So I cannot use codeIDependencycode .p  pI wire these up using an Autofac Module class in each module.p  pUnfortunately this leads to last registration wins and both modules will use the last registered implementation, even though the expected result would be that each uses their own.p  pTo be clear, each module is developed by a separate team, who dont coordinate with each other, but do use the same guidelines for module creation. The example above is just one instance of this occurring, but it is fair to assume there would be more.p  pHow might I go about ensuring that each team can register their own dependencies for their modules, without constantly having to check with the authors of other modulesp

Negative 642 pI can write simple algorithms in Haskell, and even successfully coded a very simple graphics raytracer spheres, planes, rectangles as a learning tool I wrote a more complex one in C, for an online course. All settings for this raytracer were hardcoded as constants, be it the desired image widthheight, camera position, ambient light intensity, etc. Examplep  precodeimageWidth  1600 imageHeight  900 bgColor  Color 0 0 0 maxDepth  5 ambientIntensity  Color 0 0 0 codepre  pHowever, as soon as I tried to strongextend the raytracer to read these settings and the scene itself positions of objects, lights, etc from a filestrong, I hit a brick wall. Example scene filep  precodesize 1600 900 output generatedimage.png ambient 0.1 0.1 0.1 triangle 0.5 1.4 2.8 triangle 0.5 2.4 3.8 sphere 5.5 5.5 0 4 sphere 5.5 5.5 0 4 codepre  pstrongImportantstrong The scene file additionally includes matrix operations translate, rotate, etc, which I should store in a stack as I read the file, as well as material definitions for the objects. If I read a sphere in a certain line, that sphere should use the material and matrix transformation that are set as of that line. Then, some more matrix transformations and material settings may or may not follow before reading another object sphere, triangle, etc, and so on.p  pIt seems to me that this task involves some severe data mutation. Due to Haskells pure nature and my limited knowledge, Im having problems with IO types and how to proceed in general, and my Internet research honestly didnt help a lot.p  pI know how to read the scene file using codereadFilecode, get each line using codelinescode, separate parameters using codewordscode and even convert those to IntsFloats as needed using codereadcode. I believe I should apply a function to each line, probably using codemapMcode or codemapMcode, which should detect the used command size, ambient, sphere, etc, and act as needed. But actions are very different for each command. While size only requires that I save the image width and height in values, sphere would require that I read values, use the currently active matrix transformation, currently active material and then store it in a list somewhere. I cant read everything and then act, or I would have to also store the order of operations and the problem would be the same... But, even in the simpler size case, Im clueless about how to do this, as these are all operations that involve mutation.p  pConcretelyp  ol lipHow should I go about strongbinding a value read from a file to a namestrong, in order to use it later Ex. codeimageWidthcode and codeimageHeightcode. With only one setting in the file, I could do this by simply returning the read value from the reader function. This is not the case...pli lipShould I strongcreate a new data type named Scenestrong with named parameters they are many, which contains all the settings to later use in the raytracer This is how I would do it in C, but here it pollutes the function namespace if that is how I should call it with all the arguments.pli lipHow could I achieve this mutation of values Im assuming I need pointers or some impure Haskell functionality, and I believe only this initial setup would require such things. Later on, when the image is generated, I should be able to access the stored values as usual, using pure functions. Is this possible None of the settings read from the file are supposed to change in runtime, but strongthey involve mutation of data while readingstrong, especially in the case of materials, the stack of matrix transformations and even adding to the list of objects.pli ol  pI apologize for the long question. I realize it is also rather abstract and hasnt got a code solution. If my questions are too broad, could you recommend a resource where such a problem is tackled in a clear way Im feeling that I also need to learn quite a lot about Haskell before achieving this.p  pMany thanks.p

Negative 642 pIm migrating hadoop 1.0.4 codes into a Hadoop 2.3 platform, and met with a weird behavior change of DistributedCachep  pIn hadoop 1, if we want to cache a file at codeuserfoofilebarname.avrocode, the DistributedCache will copy this file into a local cache folder, and create the same sub directories accordingly. So the file is stored at code[ROOTOFTMPCACHEDIR]userfoofilebarname.avrocode.p  pNow the same codes in Hadoop 2 will put the file directly in the root folder without creating any sub directories. So now the cached file is stored at code[ROOTOFTMPCACHEDIR]name.avrocode. p  pThis will cause name conflicts if we are caching multiple files especially when file names are like codepartr00000.avrocode.p  pOf course, applying a link and renaming the cached file into a unique name can be one way to solve this problem but more generally, creating unique names seem to be trivial in many cases, especially when needs to guarantee unique names across different mappersreducers.

Negative 642 pFirst off, this is my own project, not a homework assignment.p  pHeres the situation. I have a web application ASP.NET w MVC 5 and I use the session to store certain things e.g. user info. Now, there are two tabs open, each on one part of the page. We will call them Tab A and Tab B. Heres the scenariop  pTab A is open to Page Ap  pTab B is open to Page Bp  pIn Tab B, the user does an action which requires the update of a session variable. Thus, I write the new data to the session variable via an Ajax call to a controller method.p  pIf I refresh Tab A, however, the data in the session variable does not update for Tab A.p  pIf I then refresh Tab B, then go back to Tab A and refresh, then the data in the session updates for Tab A.p  pThe other odd thing is, if I refresh Tab A, but never refresh Tab B, then Tab B thinks the session data never updated either.p  pIm not sure why the session data wont update until I refresh Tab B.p

Negative 642 pI am trying to create an ad platform for a bitcoin faucet and hence using MySQL as DB. There is a reason I mention bitcoin in my question, because I believe my problem is somewhat associated with it. Bitcoin takes into account decimal places up to eighth decimal. So, the payment coming from someone can be 0.01234567 BTC, which generally does not happen for normal monetary transaction.

Following is the statement I am using...p  precodeUPDATE  ordertable  SET     status  success  WHERE   orderid  orderid      AND amount lt amount codepre  pThe amount field has been defined as DOUBLE.

Negative 642 pI am trying to find a good example of how to do a ForEach to take a List and convert it to XML. The reason I want to do a ForEach is because I can do a trycatch on each item and make sure I process all the roads before they fail. This is really coming for a decrypted excel file on the file system, but if I can do it via a List, I think Ill be able to convert it. If it does fail, now with it being a ForEach, I now have the ability to make the XML document no matter what and also log what column fails and what row ie what persons name it failed on. Then I can check the actual excel file and fix the issue and reupload just that record. p  pAny help would be appreciate it.

Negative 642 pIm attempting to update a users secondary information addresses, emails, externalIds, ims, phones, organizations, relationships  the things listed on the a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comadminsdkdirectoryv1referenceuserspatch relnofollowpatcha page that are arrays and such. Im successfully able to authenticate, add new information one or more at a time and remove one as long as it leaves one remaining I update the JArray leaving everything but the one I want.p  pSo, if I have 3 addresses I can remove one or two and it updates appropriately. I can easily use a patch to clear and update normal information like the first and last name, rename users and update passwords.p  pHowever, if I try to remove ALL of one type of information, nothing happens. I have tried setting the user address property to null as well as an empty List or Array. Through debugging I have verified the user patch its sending out is accurate, but nothing seems to happen serverside.p  pI tried using a full Update, as well and again using null or empty lists, but the same issue happens.p  pWhat do I need to do to fully clean out one of these propertiesp  pExample codep  precodeTry both a full user for an update and a blank user for a patch User uRetrieved  directoryServiceDict[Domain].Users.GetfullEmail.Execute User uPatch  new User uPatch.Addresses  null uRetrieved.Addresses  new ListltAddressgt try both a patch and update directoryServiceDict[Domain].Users.PatchuPatch, u.PrimaryEmail.Execute directoryServiceDict[Domain].Users.UpdateuRetrieved, u.PrimaryEmail.Execute codepre  pstrongUpdatestrong I ran a series of tests, trying to pass anything I could but nothing had worked. After digging in the API source code I found that I could call the services Serializer method to see what its piping out, and I found that assigning it an empty string, and empty list, a list with one empty string, a new Address for example object and a list with an new Address object all didnt work. The serializer threw them as expected, however.p  pIf I set it to null, though, it was ignored.p  pUpon reviewing the a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comadminsdkdirectoryv1guidesperformancepatch relnofollowpatch semanticsa page I see the followingp  blockquote   pTo delete a field, specify the field and set it to null. For example, comment null. You can also delete an entire object if it is mutable by setting it to null.p blockquote  pLooking at the given examples, they want the data to show up like codeaddressesnullcode and not like any of the other variations such as codeaddressescode, codeaddresses[]code or codeaddresses[]code.p  pAfter spending some time digging in to the API code I was able to find a hrefhttpscode.google.compgoogleapidotnetclientsourcebrowseSrcGoogleApis.CoreApisJsonNewtonsoftJsonSerializer.csr6e15a96917b603dcf4fecbf5534ef5177fcc3d24 relnofollowline 42 of the Serializer they usea in which they set the serializer settings to ignore null I assume to help keep data amounts lower for patching, for example.p  pThis works for most things, but means when trying to Patch or Update, the serializer is ignoring the values set as null and therefore the server is not seeing that entry and wont delete it.p  pSo, Im working on trying to figure out the best way to fix this. There are some a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions22596472jsonnetpartialupdaterestapiclientother postsa here on StackOverflow Im going to look at, and hopefully Ill be able to work it out unless someone gets to it first. If I do, Ill post an answer.p  pstrongUpdate 2strong I was able to get the code to print out a serialized string including the Null by creating a new Customizer for the String type. Each time the code is run it generates a customized NullToken basically a generated GUID that I tacked a word on to that is set as the string value of the field I want to delete. Then when the serializer hits a string, it checks to see if the string matches the NullToken or not. If it does, I use a jsonWriter method of codeWriteNullcode. Otherwise, I just pass it to the general codeWriteValuecode.p  pI then just had to customize a series of classes the Initializer that gets passed to the Service, the NewtonsoftJsonSerializer that is part of the Initializer and the Customizer that is added to the NJS settings and set those up to be used instead of the defaults when creating the service.p  pNow my code properly pumps out something like codeaddressesnullcode and I am happy about that.p  pUnfortunately it still doesnt work. I did some more testing in the API explorer and realized even though the returned object shows an update of what you put in, nothing actually is happening. I dont think its deleting at all and therefore I have a hrefhttpscode.google.comagoogle.compappsapiissuesissuesdetailid3701 relnofollowopened an issue for the API itselfa. If it turns out to be my own fault, Ill throw an answer here.p  pstrongSummarystrong Im now fairly certain the issue is in the Google API itself.p

Negative 642 pI have a CameraComponent class. It contains a class called CameraState. A simplified examplep  precodepublic class CameraState      public float zoom  1f      a number of other fields, some value types, some reference types...   public class CameraGameComponent      private CameraState currentCameraState  new CameraState      public CameraState CurrentCameraState              get  return currentCameraState          set  currentCameraState  value           ... codepre  pThe idea is that another class can create a new CameraState, set it up, and then set CurrentCameraState to make the camera use that new state. That works fine.p  pAlternatively that other class can get the CurrentCameraState, store it or change it as desired in which time other parts of the code may change CurrentCameraState, and then set the CurrentCameraState to make the camera use that stored state.p  pThe problem is that when the other class reads the CurrentCameraState and then changes its version of the state, the state in the camera is also changed. For examplep  precode in another class  Camera.CurrentCameraState.zoom is currently 1f CameraState state  Camera.CurrentCameraState state.zoom  20f     line 1 CameraState testState  Camera.CurrentCameraState float testzoom  testState.zoom     line 2  at this point testzoom is 20f, not 1f codepre  pI would like the changing of zoom in line 1 not to affect the zoom value in the Camera.CurrentCameraState, so that at line 2 testzoom has a value of 1f.p  pSimilarly, ifp  precode in another class, class 1  Camera.CurrentCameraState.zoom is currently 1f CameraState state  Camera.CurrentCameraState codepre  p[...]p  precode elsewhere, in yet another class, class 2 Camera.CurrentCameraState.zoom  20f codepre  p[...]p  precode at a later point in class 1 float testzoom  state.zoom     line 3  at this point testzoom is 20f, not 1f codepre  pI want testzoom at line 3 to be what it was when it was stored, ie 1f.p  pI know why this happens CurrentCameraState returns a reference, and I can think of a number of ways to stop it happening return a new deep copy of the CameraState class, use a struct, get the Camera class to handle storing and restoring of states, etc but my question isp  pWhat is the best practice way to achieve this for this sort of usage Am I missing something obviousp

Negative 642 pShort question is all in the title.... TLDR below.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions23572766changestylesheetruleselectordynamicallyThis questiona and the comments talk about using the id on a style sheet containing a single rule as a clever technique for isolating styles that must change significantly, and works for changing both the selector and the style content.p  pA case that seems like it would be more frequent to me would be just to change the content, and that can be done by referencing the cssRule.style.properties ... if the correct cssRule can be located.p  pBut individual style rules dont seem to have provision for an id, or a way to locate them among the sometimes hundreds of style rules in a style sheet or collection of style sheets.p  pa hrefhttpwww.hunlock.comblogsTotallyPwnCSSwithJavascript relnofollowthis linka talks about how to locate a rule by the selector text, but it seems one must match the selector text exactly, and that the implementation only finds the first rule with that selector text, although there could be more than one. The last one might be more useful to find, if the desire is to change a visible style.  Obviously the code could be tweaked to return the last, or to return an array... but sometimes the selector text gets atrociously long, too.p  pHaving a way to flag the particular rule that wants to be changed dynamically would seem to be useful. If the stylesheet is manipulated, keeping the array index would be a brittle, bugsusceptible way of finding it.p

The above code executes in an AsyncTask, and before it executes, I move the user back to the codeNewsItemsFragmentcode.p  pI was expecting the news list to get updated, once the AsyncTask completes and the UI to get refreshed. However, this is not happening. Since the codeImageAdaptercode is inside the codeNewsAdaptercode, do I need to somehow tell the NewsAdapter that there has been a data change as well If so, how do I do this Calling notifyDataSetChanged wont work, since I didnt modify the underlying list data in codeNewsAdaptercode using codeaddcode.p

Negative 642 pSo Im trying to build an app that has two different kind of users, namely customers and sellers. The app is designed in such a way that both of them will have different kind of navigation bars and access to different kind of  pages via routes. As such, Im trying to see what is the best way to achieve this Im thinking of either of the following solutions 1. using compose binding or areas in my shell.html and by having a container and based on a certain condition, the correct specific view partial viewwill be injected and the default binding context will be a common shell.js. However, the nav bar and each navigation panel displayed is determined by the routes that have p  precodenavtrue codepre  pand both seller and customer will have different routes that are marked strongnavtruestrong. Is there a way to work around this limitation if we use this approach 2. using compose binding but having two different views and viewmodels that we bind to our shell.html and shell.js. In other words, there will be two routers. However, Ive read a number of posts about having two routers and apparently having multiple main routers in an app is not suggested. Is there another way I should approach thisI was having thinking of having multiple SPAs but I figure that would not be efficient since this is a mobile app. Any help or suggestion is greatly appreciatedp

For example, I might want to do something similar with the CPSs detail occupational metric, which has hundreds of levels.p  pMy gut tells me margins may be part of the solution but Im not familiar enough with that command... also, Id like to be able to generate table output so I can graph in other software.p  pETA Heres the way I tried to do this for fixing weights by age and sex by cycling through all the data, comparing the contemporaneous proportions to the base quarter proportions, and then adjusting the individual weights accordingly.

Negative 642 pIve been trying to force a scrollable div to still do its elastic effect even if scrolltop is 0 are at maximum. The ability to scroll the body or not appears to have nothing to do with it. If the element is at scroll position 0 it will not elastic. p  pIve tried to add 1px of padding on scroll end and then move scrolltop down a pixel but its a poor solution. p  pWebKit overflow scrolling is a CSS property that allows a scrollable element on a webpage to mimic the native scrolling of the window on an iOS device. Provided the element needing to be scrolled is not at the top scrolltop 0 and the user scrolls up the element will use full hardware acceleration and mimic how the window would elasticly scroll including the bounce effect at the end. Equally the element can be scrolled down mimicking full elastic scrolling unless IT is at the bottom at which point it scrolls the body instead. My question is if there is anyway to maintain the scrolling effect on the element as you would be able to do with a native app this scrolling the elemenht and not the body. p

Negative 642 pI am creating a multiple column hibernate codeUserTypecode to persist a codejavax.money.MonetaryAmountcode as defined in JSR354, specifically to persist the codeorg.javamoney.moneta.Moneycode reference implementation.p  pThis small project is on a hrefhttpsgithub.comaxiopistyusertypes relnofollowgithuba. If you clone it and run codemvn testcode youll see that all test cases pass except one, codeMonetaryAmountUserTypeTest.testQueryByMonetaryAmountsGreaterThancode. I discovered that I am not able to query for monetary values based on comparison operations, except for by equality. For example, given this codeEntitycodep  precodeEntity ... public class MonetaryAmountWrapper    ...   Typetype  com.github.axiopisty.usertypes.hibernate.jsr354.MonetaryAmountUserType   Columnscolumns       Columnname  monetaryamount,     Columnname  currencycode      private MonetaryAmount monetaryAmount   ...  codepre  pThis query returns the appropriate recordsp  precodeselect maw from MonetaryAmountWrapper maw where maw.monetaryAmount  monetaryAmount codepre  pBut this query returns no records. I would like this query to return the expected rows as defined by the failed test case.p  precodeselect maw from MonetaryAmountWrapper maw where maw.monetaryAmount gt monetaryAmount codepre  pstrongQuestion 1strong Why does the query with the comparison operator, codegtcode, not work as one would expect codeUserTypecode defines methods for implementors to provide equals and hashCode, but does not define anything for comparable objects. I think this might have something to do with it but a detailed explanation would be helpful.p  pstrongQuestion 2strong What do I need to do to make it so the MonetaryAmount values persisted in the database are comparable according to the hibernate UserType such that values may be comparedsortedqueried according to comparable operations such as codeltcode and codegtcode in a hibernate or JPA queryp  pstrongEdit 1strongp  pHere is the SQL that is generated when I configure hibernate to showsqlp  precodeHibernate      select         monetaryam0.id as id0,         monetaryam0.monetaryamount as monetary20,         monetaryam0.currencycode as currency30      from         monetaryamountwrapper monetaryam0      where         monetaryam0.monetaryamountgt          and monetaryam0.currencycodegt codepre  pAs you can see, Hibernate is using the codegtcode comparison operator in the query. But for this particular UserType, I dont want the comparison operator to apply to the codecurrencycodecode field in the UserType. Is there a way to override how Hibernate generates the SQL for a multicolumn UserType, or is this just a limitation with multicolumn UserTypesp

Negative 642 pIm working on an Open Data Project over at www.openwifinder.com . Were using firebase to store the data that well load to an ESRI map using javascript. Because were working with the idea of Open Data, we want the public to be able to download our entire point cloud stored in firebase as a .json file. My team originally copied the link from the Export Data Button on the data page, but weve found that the link is temporary due to an expiring auth token in the url. Weve also tried linking to the Instance.firebaseio.com url, but when you click it in another browser, it says that youre not authorized to view the firebase.p  pIdeally, wed like to do something like Firebase has done with its Open Data Set page. When you click on those open data urls, you get taken to the data page of the open firebase, and you cant do anything but read and export the data. It doesnt necessarily have to be a public link, but even if the user has to sign up for a firebase account to view the data it would be alright. Of course a true public link would be ideal for our purpose.p  pAny ideas Ive scoured the help page of the website for clues. p  pThanksp

Negative 642 pIm currently working on a project of a mobile application that can show weather forecast on map e.g. PocketGrib. I decided to use GRIB files but I dont know how to decode them.

The best way to me would be to convert GRIB data to txt and parse it further in my way to get needed values. p  pDoes anyone have experience with it Any tips are appreciated.

Negative 642 pIve recently started using Interactive Reports in my Oracle APEX application. Previously, all pages in the application used Classic Reports. The Interactive Report in my new page works great, but, now, Id like to add a summary boxtable above the Interactive Report on the same page that displays the summed values of some of the columns in the Interactive Report. In other words, if my Interactive Report displays 3 distinct manager names, 2 distinct office locations, and 5 different employees, my summary box would contain one row and three columns with the numbers, 3, 2, and 5, respectively. p  pSo far, I have made this work by creating the summary box as a Classic Report that counts distinct values for each column in the same table that my Interactive Report pulls from. The problem arises when I try to filter my interactive report. Obviously, the classic report doesnt refresh based on the interactive report filters, but I dont know how I could link the two so that the classic report responds to the filters from the interactive report. Based on my research, there are ways to reference the value in the Interactive Reports search box using javascriptjquery. If possible, Id like to reference the value from the interactive tables filter with javascript or jquery in order to refresh the summary box each time a new filter is applied. Does anyone know how to do thisp

Using the flash builder profiler I have found that my bottlenecks arep  p[render]  42.31 [prerender]  41.41p  pover 80 of the time my application is spent rendering. The game currently uses vector graphics for UI elements, characters and pets there can be up to 15 characters and 15 pets. The background is a bitmap. p  pWe have messed with converting the vector characters and pets into bitmaps and found that in some cases where the vector art animates a lot we get a large gain but for other characters with little animation it actually runs slower I believe because the redraw regions on the vector art are so small.p  pI believe the biggest gain we can get on the rendering front is to remove vector art but I dont think our basic approach to animating bitmaps is better in every case. Are there any optimized AS3 libraries that handle animating bitmaps or converting vector art Any resources you could point me to for research on these topics is greatly appreciated.p  pThank youp

Negative 642 pBIRT ReportDesigner How to generate PPT  PPTX with master slidep  ol lipChallenge By including slides from a BIRT generated PPTX into a new and via master slide preformated PPT, the presets of the master slide are not taking effect. This means that f.e. fonts, fontsizes of headlines, layers, bullets etc. which are typically defined in the master slide, are unfortunately not used. Instead of this, the formats of the BIRTPPTX are added into the new slide which results in an unwelcome mix of fonts from both PPTX.pli lipAssumption The assumption why this doesnt work is, that the BIRT generatet PPTX seems to be originally generated without a master slide shown in PPT as empty. In further consequence there can be no mapping between master slides and the new destination PPTX has no idea of sourceformats.pli lipQuestions Maybe the key to success is to build the BIRTPPTX with a master slide Is there a way to define f.e. a label in BIRT and attach the information to it, that it is a headline of layer x in the PPTX master slidepli ol  pAny suggestions are welcome.p

Negative 642 pAt work I ran into a type of crash that I am having a hard time fixing and it seems rather typical and I was wondering if theres a known solution to these types of crashes.p  pBasically I have a class, that calls a function from another class and as a result of that call flow not directly but rather much more complicated as this is production code, our class ends up getting deleted. p  pWhen we return to our class the code calls another member function and of course this is where the crash occurs because after delete we are not supposed to call any member functions or access any variables.p  precodeclass A        B ptrB        A                        A                       void MemberFunction                 ptrBgtDoSomeStuff          SomeOtherMemberFunc               void SomeOtherMemberFunc                codepre  pSo on the above example the crash would occur on the call to codeSomeOtherMemberFunccode because codeptrBgtDoSomeStuffcode deletes our class instance.p  pOne possible fix I think is to add a return value or a parameter to codeDoSomeStuffcode that signals the called class it was deleted so I could change the code to p  precodevoid MemberFunction      ifptrBgtDoSomeStuff               SomeOtherMemberFunc       codepre  pbut I havent looked into this deeply the real issue is much more complicated than the example because the call flow consists of many function calls and all would somehow have to be changed to signal the called function of this delete... p  pIs there a more elegant way to do this other than return value  new parameter to codeDoSomeStuffcode  Hopefully one that might be accepted during our internal code review process p

Negative 642 pI hope I can explain myself with this first question I post on Stack Overflow.p  pI am building a small test application with the MEAN stack.p  pThe application receives variable data from Mongoose based on an Express Route I have created.p  pFor example the url is localhost3000citiestestParisp  pBased on the name of the city the response gives me the name of the city and a description. I Know how to get this data inside the .ejs template But thats not what I want. I want to use this data inside an ngRepeat.p  pMaybe this is not the right way but maybe you can help me figure this out.p  pThe reason I want to do this is because I dont want a single page application but an Angular template that can be used over and over for each city and only uses the data that gets back from the mongoose find results and not the whole cities array.p  papp.js p  precodevar cityRoutes  require.routescities app.usecities, cityRoutes app.setviews, .views  specify the views directory app.setview engine, ejs  register the template engine codepre  p.routescitiescities.js p  precodevar express  requireexpress var citiesList   require..servercontrollerscitiescontroller  var bodyParser  requirebodyparser var urlencode  bodyParser.urlencoded extended false   var router  express.Router   because this file is a fallback for the route cities inside app.js  the route will become localhost3000citiestestname  not to be confused by its name in this file. router.routetestname     .getcitiesList.viewTest   module.exports  router codepre  p..servercontrollerscitiescontroller.js p  precodevar City  require..modelscities  module.exports.viewTest  functionrequest, responce City.find stad request.params.name , functionerr, results      if err return console.errorerr         if results.length              responce.json 404       else          responce.renderangular.ejs,   messagesresults           through this point everything works fine          the angular.ejs template gets rendered correctly          Now my problem is how tho get the results from the           response.render inside the Angular directive           so I can use the data in a scope            codepre  p..modelscities.jsp  precodevar mongoose  requiremongoose  module.exports  mongoose.modelCity,      stad  type String, required true ,     omschrijving String  codepre  pAngularJS directive p  precode This is where I would like to use the messages result data  so I can create a scope that handles data that can be different  for each url   so basically I am using this directive as a template  app.directivebestelFormulier, function   return      restrict E,     templateUrl partialsbestelformulier.html,     controller [scope, http, resource, cookieStore, functionscope, http, resource, cookieStore         at this point it would be nice that the scope gets the      url based results.

The problem occurs when I quickly open codescroll view 1code and codescroll view 2code when this happens codescroll view 1code is still decelerating and codescroll view 2codes opening tries to force codescroll view 1code to close and breaks the animations and sometimes does not close. One way to solve this would be to disable scrolling until a scroll view finishes decelerating. But, Im looking for other solutions which handle this problem more seamlessly. Ive tried codescrollView.layer.removeAllAnimationscode. This does not stop the decelerating animation. I want the animations of codescroll view 1code to stop instantly when codescroll view 2code is scrolled and then codescroll view 1code can be animated to codecontentOffset  0code.p  blockquote   pIdentify if codescroll viewcode is opening or closing.p blockquote  precodefunc scrollViewDidScrollscrollView UIScrollView      scrollView.bounces  scrollView.contentOffset.x gt 20     if scrollView.contentOffset.x lt self.lastContentOffset ampamp scrollView.contentOffset.x lt 70          ifOpening  false          else if scrollView.contentOffset.x gt 5          ifOpening  true          self.lastContentOffset  scrollView.contentOffset.x   codepre  blockquote   pWhen a codescroll viewcode is dragged close all other codescroll viewcodes.p blockquote  precodefunc scrollViewWillBeginDraggingscrollView UIScrollView       for eachScrollView in taskArrayScrollView         if  eachScrollView  scrollView              eachScrollView.layer.removeAllAnimations             UIView.animateWithDuration0.2,                 delay 0.5,                 options .CurveEaseIn ,                 animations  eachScrollView.contentOffset.x  0 ,                 completion nil                             codepre  blockquote   pTo snap the codescroll viewcode to either codeoffsetcode 0 or 70p blockquote  precodefunc scrollViewDidEndDraggingscrollViewa UIScrollView, willDecelerate decelerate Bool      let intialContentOffset  scrollViewa.contentOffset.x     var originalContentOffset CGFloat     var finalContentOffset CGFloat     var minOffset CGFloat      if intialContentOffset  boundOfScreen.width         return           if ifOpening         minOffset  20.0         originalContentOffset  0         finalContentOffset  70           else          minOffset  50.0         originalContentOffset  0         finalContentOffset  70           if decelerate         if intialContentOffset lt minOffset              UIView.animateWithDuration0.2,                 delay 0.1,                 options .CurveEaseIn ,                 animations  scrollViewa.contentOffset.x  originalContentOffset ,                 completion                      finished in scrollViewa.userInteractionEnabled  true                                                else              UIView.animateWithDuration0.2,                 delay 0.1,                 options .CurveEaseIn ,                 animations  scrollViewa.contentOffset.x  finalContentOffset ,                 completion                      finished in scrollViewa.userInteractionEnabled  true                                                func scrollViewDidEndDeceleratingscrollViewb UIScrollView      let intialContentOffset  scrollViewb.contentOffset.x     var originalContentOffset CGFloat     var finalContentOffset CGFloat     var minOffset CGFloat     printlnintialContentOffset intialContentOffset      if ifOpening         minOffset  20.0         originalContentOffset  0         finalContentOffset  70         printlndec opening           else          minOffset  50.0         originalContentOffset  0         finalContentOffset  70         printlndec closing            if intialContentOffset lt minOffset          UIView.animateWithDuration0.2,             delay 0.1,             options .CurveEaseIn ,             animations scrollViewb.contentOffset.x  originalContentOffset ,             completion                  finished in scrollViewb.userInteractionEnabled  true                                else          UIView.animateWithDuration0.2,             delay 0.1,             options .CurveEaseIn ,             animations scrollViewb.contentOffset.x  finalContentOffset ,             completion                  finished in scrollViewb.userInteractionEnabled  true                              codepre

Negative 642 pI am deploying some web services using RestEasy on JBoss 7.1.1.  I have two classes that process different resource requests along the same path. UserAPI.java handles codebookscode and codebooksidcode, etc.  MaintenanceAPI.java handles codebookscheckedoutcode.p  pUserAPI requires a previous login, which is validated by a RestEasyInterceptor called codeAuthInterceptorcode.  The maintenance API does not require a login, but should only be accessible as a GET via localhost its handled by codeLocalInterceptorcode.p  pTo keep them separate, AuthInterceptors accept method returns false if codedeclaring.getName.containsMaintenancecode  so it should not process codebookscheckedoutcode at all. LocalInterceptors accept method returns true if codedeclaring.equalsMaintenanceAPI.classcode.p  pAuthInterceptor is declared in web.xml under resteasy.providers.  But Eclipse thinks there can be only 1 parameter in the XML element, so LocalInterceptor has the annotation codeProvidercode in hopes itll magically work.p  pstrongRejected XML configstrongp  pThis failsp  precodeltcontextparamgt     ltparamnamegtresteasy.providersltparamnamegt     ltparamvaluegtcom.foo.AuthInterceptorltparamvaluegt     ltparamvaluegtcom.foo.LocalInterceptorltparamvaluegt ltcontextparamgt codepre  pIm not sure what the correct syntax is, there is no help in the RestEasy docs.

AuthInterceptor must be correctly rejecting it, but why would UserAPI be asked to handle it and furthermore, why would the codeint idcode be assigned the string checkedoutp  pI havent posted code because I am asking both whether I can even do what Im trying like why cant I subclass String  no code needed if you understand the question and why the mapping is trying to do the wrong thing instead of just failing.p  pMaybe its as simple as getting web.xml correctp

Because I am using CloudFlare, I have to use a separate domain for Websockets Websockets are currently only available for Enterprise customers ... All other customers ... should create a subdomain for Websockets in their CloudFlare DNS and disable the CloudFlare proxy. Im using ws.mysite.com.p  pWhen a user logs in at https  www.mysite.com, a cookie is set by the tornado web server for www.mysite.com I cant seem to configure it, otherwise I would just set it to .mysite.com. When the websocket part of the application kicks in, it sends a request to wss  ws.mysite.com, but fails to authenticate because the cookie is set for a different domainwww.mysite.com.p  pIs it possible for nginx to spoof the domain so the tornado webserver registers it for .mysite.com proxycookiedomain doesnt seem to work as Id expect...
