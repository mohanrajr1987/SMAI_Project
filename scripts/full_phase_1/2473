Positive 2473 pI am using Symfony1 and am looking to get a large number of key statistics from one or two tables in the database over a period of time.p  pAm I better to write a small number of queries and then loop through the results to build up the statistics or is it more efficient writing smaller more specific database queries.p  pThere are about 7080 key statistics I am looking at and my initial thoughts were to write some big queries then populate a class with the statistics.p  pI have since thought though to extend the repository class with some simple queries that I could then pull via Ajax to ensure performance is good.p  pThe whole process has led me to question what the best method is, so I thought I would ask the question to get some thoughts and other suggestions.p  pThanks in advance.p

Positive 2473 pI work on a Symfony1 application.p  pFor part of the application we use the symfony admin generator which builds default actions and templates for a particular module.p  pThe autogenerated action methods can be overridden in the child action class and the templates can be overridden, by making one with the same name in the modules template folder.

The main templates and most of the partials can be reused as is.p  precodeapps     otherapp         lib             printingActions.class.php         modules             ticket                 actions                     actions.class.php                 lib                 templates                     printSuccess.php exactly the same for all 3                     part1.php                     part2.php      exactly the same for all 3                     part3.php             receipt                 actions                     actions.class.php                 lib                 templates                     printSuccess.php exactly the same for all 3                     part1.php                     part2.php      exactly the same for all 3                     part3.php             voucher                 actions                     actions.class.php                 lib                 templates                     printSuccess.php exactly the same for all 3                     part1.php                     part2.php      exactly the same for all 3                     part3.php codepre  pWhat I would like to do is pull out the common ones so that each module and any future modules with a similar interface, only have to have the partials with module specific information.p  pThis would be my ideal setupp  precodeapps     otherapp         lib             printingActions.class.php             printingCommonTemplates                 printSuccess.php exactly the same for all 3                 part2.php      exactly the same for all 3         modules             ticket                 actions                     actions.class.php                 lib                 templates                     part1.php                     part3.php             receipt                 actions                     actions.class.php                 lib                 templates                     part1.php                     part3.php             voucher                 actions                     actions.class.php                 lib                 templates                     part1.php                     part3.php codepre  pI know this kind of thing can be done, since the admin generator does it, but after hours of digging, I cant find where exactly it does it.p  pCould someone point me in the right direction for this one Ideally, if there is a fallback template setting that I can set for a particular module or a filter class that I can extend to do what I needp

Positive 2473 pI am new to Symfony, but have experience with other web frameworks eg Ruby on Rails.p  pIm trying to modify a web page, and I traced the template to a particular file codecachebackenddevmodulesautoUserstemplatesindexSuccess.phpcodep  pIf I update this file, the web page is updated.p  pHowever, this file is not in the git repository.  And given the top directory is called codecachecode, I surmise that this file was generated by Symfony.  So modifying this file directly is probably not the right solution.p  pIm trying to understand how the cache file is generated, how I can find the places of the real source files to make the change.  Can someone explain pleasep  pAfter I make the changes, how can I then regenerate the cache file Or is this something handled automatically by SymfonyPHPp  pThanks you.p

I am using the reference code from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions22195493exportmysqldatabaseusingphponly2220108422201084Export MySQL database using PHP onlya. I want to use it in my executeFunction but it has some Core PHP functions which are not working when I put then in my executeFunction. But these work when I place this script in Source Files and execute the file. I have tried to find the alternate functions of these in Symfony but not able to do this.

Negative 2473 pI have been reading up on Files Owner here on Stack Overflow and a few other resources, but I was left with one question. When do I not need a Files Owner for a nib In chapter 8 of emExploring the iPhone SDKem a great book by the way you design a table view cell nib. The author says the followingp  blockquoteYou might be wondering why were not doing anything with the Files Owner icon. The reason is that we just dont need to. Were using this table cell to display data, but all the interaction with the user is going to go through the table view, so it doesnt need its own controller class. Were really just using the nib as a sort of template so we can design our table cells visually.blockquote  ppThis does not make sense to me. I was under the impression that all nib files needed a Files Owner, but obviously my understanding of this concept is not complete. Can someone restate when and why I dont need to worry about Files Ownerpp

Negative 2473 pIt seems strange that the language apparently includes no suitable functionality.p  pI find myself with data that would best be expressed as a multidimensional array but its utterly constant, there is no way anyone could want to change it without also changing the associated code.

However, C doesnt seem to support anything like this.p  pGoogle shows many people griping about this, no good answers.p  pHow do people handle this sort of situationp  pAnd dont say that constants dont belong in codethe last one I bumped into was all possible permutations of 4 items.  Unless the very nature of spacetime changes this is set in stone.p  pWhat happened  There was an answer that came pretty close, I was asking about a detail and it vanished  Simply declaring an array sort of does the jobthe only problem is that the array allocation is going to run every time.  The one in front of me contains 96 valueshow do I get it to initialize only once  Do I just have to accept scoping it far wider than it should be  As it stands its in one 3line routine thats inside what amounts to an On3 routine.p

Negative 2473 pIm writing an application to receive SMS messages via an HTTP gateway. The main parameters Ill be processing are the senders phone number and the message itself. However, depending on the keyword within the message, Ill need to execute different logic  return a different response. To start with, I used a simple ifelse which turned into a switch statement, and now Im looking to clean it up a bit.p  pI think what want is some sort of implementation of the command pattern, but Im not sure. I could implement each operation as a command object and register them all with the command processor, but then Id have to implement something like a CanExecute... function to determine the appropriate command to execute. The conditions for which a command should be executed may depend on several factors such as the keyword or specific message content.p  pIm thinking something like the followingp  precodepublic interface ISmsCommand       bool CanExecutestring sender, string message     string Executestring sender, string message   public class SmsHelpCommand  ISmsCommand       public bool CanExecutestring sender, string message              return message.ToLower.StartsWithhelp           public string Executestring sender, string message               return For more info, visit...        public class SmsHttpHandler  IHttpHandler      ListltISmsCommandgt commands  new ListltISmsCommandgt      public bool IsReusable              get  return true            public void ProcessRequestHttpContext context              var sender  context.Request.Form[...]         var message  context.Request.Form[Message]          foreach var command in commands                       if command.CanExecutesender, message                              var response  command.Executesender, message                 SendTextMessagesender, response                 break                             codepre  pSomething about this code seems fishy to me, though.

This actual rule is only enforced by the definition of the constructor and the compiler cant actually figure it out by the declaration alone. If I drop it, and try to pass a codePointerltSubgtcode to a constructor of codePointerltBasegtcode, I get a compile error, despite of the possible path through codeoperator T code.p  pWhile it solves the above problem, it creates another one.

So I am not able to load that workflow instance anymore. I would have hoped, if there is an error in one of the states, an exception would be thrownso that we know what the issue is, yet the entire workflow instance should not disappear.

I have seen other posts on the subject all saying generally 2.0 is better but I have some more specific questions about this that I cant seem to find any answers on.p  pApart from the different lego pieces and sensors you get with the 2.0 kit, is there any difference between a 1.0 nxt brick and 2.0 nxt brick From what I can determine from other sources, they are the same except for the firmware installed. Am I right in saying I could buy a 1.0 kit and install the same firmware that comes with the 2.0 kit and the bricks would be the same or is the 1.0 brick not compatible with the 2.0 firmwarep  pAlso, I plan to use a different programming language like c or java so I need to install specific firmware for that anyway like librcx or lejos right So if using c or java as opposed to the provided lego coding methods it doesnt matter if I am using 1.0 or 2.0 except for the lego pieces in the kit am I rightp  pIn a nutshell, assuming I am using librcx or lejos and I dont care about the sensors and lego pieces included, is there any benefit to buying a 2.0 kit over the 1.0 kitp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 2473 pIm trying to integrate a toolwindow in a Winforms application, it will be a tiny floating window to display element details in a listbox. What I need is pop the window in a relative position to the control that triggers the action, so here is the thing the Location property gives me the relative position of the control from its container the main form in this case so this is the workaround im using p  precode    public void ShowkTextBox source               Point absCoord  source.PointToScreensource.Location         this.Location  this.PointToClientabsCoord         base.Show       codepre  pBasically this is get the absolute control position and set this position previously converted into owner relative to the toolwindow. I think it should work just fine but is missing for a certain degree, and it varies depending what control i use. Its kinda confusing. Been there anyone Thanks in advance. p
Negative 2473 pI am using a div to populate a ulli list and then draw a jCarousel out of it. So this works finep  precodemycarousel.jcarousel codepre  pHere is the problemp  pThe div containing the ulli items could be hidden by the click of another button.  When the div is hidden, and I resize the browser window, the jCarousel also attempts to redraw itself, but since it is hidden, it is not able to draw it properly. The result is that everything is jumbled up in the list if I click the button again to make it visible.  But again if I resize the window now the jumbled up jCarousel is NOT hidden now, it redraws itself correctly.p  pI tried getting ahold of the jCarousel instance and reload itself as soon as the button is clicked to make the div visible the way it resizes itself when it is visible and window is resized.  p  pTo get the jCarousel, I am usingp  precodeJQuerymycarousel.datajcarousel  codepre  pand it is returned as null.p  pHow can I get the jCarousel to draw correctlyp

Negative 2473 pI am building an application that is based on MVVMLight. I am in the need of creating multiple instances of the same View, and each one should bind to its own ViewModel.p  pThe default codeViewModelLocatorcode implements ViewModels as singletons, therefore different instances of the same View will bind to the same ViewModel.p  pI could create the ViewModel in the VMLocator as a nonstatic object as simple as returning new VM..., but that would only partially help me.  In fact, I still need to keep track of the opened windows. Nevertheless, each window might open several other windows of a different kind, though. In this situation I might need to execute some operation on the parent View and all its children. For example before closing the View P, I might want to close all its children view C1, view C2, etc.. p  pHence, is there any simple and easy way to achieve this Or is there any best practice you would advice me to followp  pThanks in advance for your precious help.p  pCheers,br  Gianluca.p

Negative 2473 pim writing some low level window code for a window in x in c, and I want to prevent the user from either maximising or minimising the window. i dont mind whether this is done by rejecting the request to resize, or by removing the buttons themselves. however, i am tied to x and cant use qt or other higherlevel libraries which i know provide this functionality.p  pat the moment all i have managed to do is intercept the ResizeRequest event and then set the window size back using XResizeWindow... but this causes the window to momentarily maximise and then return to its original state. is there a way to directly reject a ResizeRequest, that would seem to be the proper way to handle this but a fair bit of googling and document trawling has not come up with a solution.p  pthanks, jamesp

Each table contains a maximum of a million rows and when that is reached, the cached list is recreated after a new table has been constructed.p  pObviously it wouldnt be a good idea to check the number of rows on every write to the table, so this could be done on a set interval, like a week, or daily  depending on how quick every million of data is created.p  pWould this be a good way to deal with large amount of data and to keep index sizes fairly lowp  pThanksp

Negative 2473 pIm writing an iOS app which has store of person records, and needs to display lists them sorted in particular ways. There are a variable number of these orderings, and they are generated on the fly, but I would like them to be stored in the datastore. The SQL way to do this is to have a ListPositions table with a list name, an id into the persons table, and a sort key. Then, to display a particular list, I can select all list ListPositions with a given name, pull in the referenced persons, and sort on the sort key. Trying to do this in CoreDatat, however I run into problems. I am trying to do this using a schema like p  precodePerson     Name     DOB     etc...      positions gtgt ListPosition  ListPosition     listName     sortKey     person gt Person codepre  pThen, I can get all the Persons in a given list with the NSPredicate  code[NSPredicate predicateWithFormatANY positions.listName like , someList]code This allows me to dynamically add lists against a large set of Persons. The problem is that I am unable to use the sortKey field of ListPosition to sort the Persons. What NSSortDescriptor will do this And if it is not possible to sort a fetch on the property of one element of a tomany relationship, what is another way to get multiple, dynamic orderings in coredata I am displaying the lists with a NSFetchedResultsController, so I cant put the lists together myself in memory. I need to do it with a single NSFetchRequest.p

Negative 2473 pIm currently using jenkinshudson for continuous integration a large mostly C project.  We have separate projects for trunk and every branch.  Also, there are some related projects for the Java code, but the setup for those are fairly basic right now we may do more later though.  The C projects do the followingp  ul liBuilds everything with options for whether to reconfigure, do a clean build, or use a fresh checkoutli liOptionally builds and runs all testsli liOptionally runs all tests using Valgrinds memcheckli liRuns cppcheckli liGenerates doxygen documentationli liPublishes reports unit tests, valgrind, cppcheck, compiler warnings, SLOC, open tasks, and code coverage using gcov, gcovr, and the cobertura pluginli liDeploys code nightly or on demand to a test environment and a package repositoryli ul  pEverything is configurable for automatic builds and optional for on demand builds.  Underneath, theres a bash script that controls much of this, which farther depends on our build system, which uses automake and autoconf along with custom bash scripts.p  pWe started using Hudson at the time because thats what the Java guys were using and we just wanted nightly builds.  Since then, weve added a lot more and continue to add more.  In some ways Hudson is great, but certainly isnt ideal.p  pIve looked at other solutions and the only one that looks like it could be a replacement is buildbot.  Would buildbot be better for this situation  Is the investment worth it since were already using Hudson  Whyp  pstrongEDITstrong Someone asked why I havent found HudsonJenkins to be ideal.  The short answer is that everything can be improved.  Im simply wondering if Jenkins is the best current solution for my use case or whether there is something better buildbot that would be easier to maintain in the long run even as new requirements come up.p

Negative 2473 pIve come across a small issue that Ive been chewing on for a day or two now.p  pUsing the Apple example project called DateCell I lifted its UIDatePicker and set it to time. I used this particular code as it did the animated slide onoff the screen.p  pMy workflow is to set four values, start time, lunch time out, lunch time in, and stop time. I set these values by using [NSDate date].  p  pI then use NSCalandercomponent calls to do some math such as add 30 minutes to start time to get lunch time out, and start time  lunch time out  8 hours to get stop time.p  pThe initial setup goes just fine. Clicking on the start time cell brings up the picker, and selecting a time change the other three times following my simple math formulas.p  pIf the second row is selected, the lunch time out, the wheel comes up again to pick your lunch time out time. However this is where my problems start. It seems that my UIDatePickerModeTime wheel returns a date portion for January 1, 1970. And its this date portion that messes up my math formulas.p  pMy question is, what can I do to fix thisp  pIve tried setting an initial, minimum time, in the XIB for the picker. This sort of works but when you pick a time on the wheel, the wheel spins itself to the time set in the XIB. This method doesnt have a clean feel to it.p  pIve tried settings the initWithTimeInterval class methods, but these block out times and isnt what Im looking for I think.p  pIve also tried the NSDateFormatterstringFromDatedateFromString calls, and these had no affect.p  pWhat I have not done yetp  pCustom defined datetime string.p  pRebuilding UIDatePickerTime from scratchp  pAm I over looking anythingp  pThanks.p

Negative 2473 pIm building a Cocoa application and have a question about using window controllers.

I want to distribute a select few copies of this program via desktop application to customers of mine to check their inventories.

And secondly, is AIR capable of dealing with the same kind of PHPAMF requests being asked of it. I read somewhere that AIR only supports HTTPService type calls and not RemoteObjectp  pI hope this makes sense. I just dont know all of the limitaitons, if any, that AIR has versus a standard output the the web. The reason I want the AIR app is to restrict the people even using this application.

Negative 2473 pI understand that naming conventions are important for a number of reasons, most having to do with making your code more readable and easier to integrate into larger projects, etc. In Java, most conventions require that method names be in codelowerCamelCasecode begin with a verb.p  pMy question is how do I choose the verb to begin the method namep  pTo make this question less vague, Im often in the situation where my first choice for a method name is a noun describing the output. In these cases, Im usually torn between appending generic verbs such as codegetcode, codegeneratecode, codecalculatecode, etc in font of the noun to conform to the verb rule. Are there general guidelines for when to use whichp  pHeres an example. I have a method that takes codedouble[] arraycode and an codeint kcode and returns codedouble[] newArraycode which is the length codekcode moving average of codearraycode, i.e. codenewArray[i]  array[ik1]...array[i]kcode with some fudging to make codenewArraycode the same length as codearraycode. My inclination is to call this method codemovingAveragecode since thats what it returns, but thats out since it doesnt begin with a verb. Should I call this method codegetMovingAveragecode or codegenerateMovingAveragecode or codecalculateMovingAveragecode or does it not really matterp

Negative 2473 pSo here is the problem. I have a common class library that holds all the repositories, domain and mapping files so the library can be reused within other web beased applications.

Code looks something like this.p  precode        private static ISessionFactory sessionFactory         private static Configuration configuration          public static Configuration Configuration                      if configuration  null                              configuration  new Configuration.Configure                          return configuration                   private static ISessionFactory SessionFactory                      get                              if sessionFactory  null                                      sessionFactory  Configuration.BuildSessionFactory                                  return sessionFactory                                public static ISession GetCurrentSession                      if CurrentSessionContext.HasBindSessionFactory                              CurrentSessionContext.BindSessionFactory.OpenSession                          return SessionFactory.GetCurrentSession          codepre  pSo the repository calls the GetCurrentSession method to get a ISession. Now this works fine but I am worried that it might not be thread safe. Can any one help me with an approach that will help me make it thread safe.p  pstrongFew things to Notestrongp  pI have thought about configuring and building the SessionFactory in global.asax of the web applications on start event but the problem with this is that the common class library in question is used within 20 different applications so this will mean going to all the applications and updating the global.asax file now before I do this I wanted to put the question out there to see if there any other ways I can go about this. So that the common class library can configure its SessionFactory itself and yet be thread safe.p  pThanks for reading this huge question. Will appericate any help.  p

Apple seems to have removed all of the functions that let you build real apps in AppleScript or Python, leaving only Objective C. p  pSo, what are my options Is it still possible to build a real, AppleScriptable Mac app using Python If so, howp  pIf it matters, what I need AppleScripted is text insertion.

Negative 2473 pId like to be able to generate a simple hash value on an ordered set of strings, so Im fine if its just a hash of the concatenation of the strings on the client side in Javascript, and generate an identical hash value on the same strings on the server side in C for an exact comparison.  The security is not overwhelmingly critical, so I dont know if it needs to be a fullblown encryption protocol although if thats the easiest path, Im open to it.

Negative 2473 pI have a few doubts regarding exception handling in iPhone. Here are theyp  ol lipSuppose I have a chain of methods which are being called one after the other, that is, method A calls method B, which in turn calls method C, which calls method D. Which is the best place to put my trycatch block is it method A or B or C or D or all of them. Also, I need to display an alert to user that an exception has occured and then, I want to log this exception to my server. So, if I am writing my try  catch block in all of this methods and if an exception occurs in method D then I think the alert will be displayed 4 times and the web service for logging will also be called 4 times till control reaches to catch block of method A. So, should I just use throw in catch block of method B, C and D and write my logic in catch block of method A top level method or should I avoid writing try  catch at all in methods B,C and D.pli lipI need some sort of error code from the exception because my web service needs parameters errorcode and description.

Negative 2473 pWould the following single threaded UDP client application see a performance benefit from using epoll over simply calling recvfromsendto on nonblocking socketsp  pLet me explain the client.p  pI am writing single threaded UDP based client custom protocol that both sends and receives data using nonblocking IO and my colleague suggested I use epoll for this. The client sends and receives multiple packets of information that are all associated with a unique session id and multiple sessions can be run simultaneously.p  pIf I use epoll, there will be a limited number of maybe 1020 file descriptors which epollwait could wait on.  Each file descriptor would be associated with one session.  So thats maximum 10  20 sessions and this number will be enforced.p  pEach session has its own state machine.  From a single thread I need to run each state machine reasonably frequently and poll the associated socket as well.p  pIn my case, Id have to use epollwait with a timeout of zero or some very small value so that I can give CPU time to run the state machines for each session. If there is data for a session then it needs to be directed to the associated state machine.p  pHowever, I cant really see much benefit of this design with such a small number of file descriptors.p  pThe way I see it is I have two design options 1. In my main loop using epoll I can poll the descriptors using epollwait with either a small timeout or no timeout.  p  pHow it handles data at this point is where Im getting a bit stuck... either I read it right away and then throw it into a queue for each state machine to pick up when its run, or I set a flag on the state machine to tell it that data is waiting and when the state machine runs itll pick it up with a call to recvfrom.  Or, I read the data and handle it right away and run the state machine for it.p  pOr... 2, Just run each state machine from the main loop and call recvfrom.  If I get some data, handle it. If I dont then do whatever else the state machine requires.  Is there huge overhead calling recvfrom when there is no datap  pWith going the epoll route Im coding in some extra complexity. If there is a strong likelyhood for it be faster in my case then I will start doing it.  However, if the second way which really simple works just as well then I would not use epoll.p  pAny thoughtsp

The solution file contains the following types of projectsp  ul linative CCli liManaged Cli liManaged Cli ul  pThe solution contains all the proper dependencies between the different types of projects. Ok, so when I build from the command line Using MSBuild, there is a problem. The dependencies for the managed projects both C and C get built in the wrong order. For instance a project will fail to build because a managed dependency is missing. For instance a managed C file will have a using declaration that will failp  precodeusing ltfoo.dllgt codepre  psince foo.dll doesnt exist yet.p  pWhich means that foo.dll should have been built before, but wasnt.  Like I mentioned earlier, the dependencies are properly set up in the solution file. For instance, if foo depends on baz, I have this in the solution file...p  precodeProjectC4ABA49443D0400A991720E167A12CFD  Foo, ...Foo.vcxproj, 5A42640E9E0A442B8A40AA91AD5444AC     ProjectSectionProjectDependencies  postProject         ...         2CE32AE0B12940BAB06EA628FA149AB3  2CE32AE0B12940BAB06EA628FA149AB3     EndProjectSection EndProject ...

I can upload small files 1 MB, but when I try to upload a 50MB file, I wait all the time till the file is uploaded, and when the indication is 100, I get a Bad gateway The proxy server received an invalid response from an upstream server.p  pIt seems to me that something timeouts between the communication of A and B and instead of being redirected to the correct url, I get a Bad gateway, not to mention that the file is not uploaded. p  pOn the apache log I see p  precode[error] proxy pass request body failed codepre  pAs suggested on other threads, Ive experimented with the following values with no luck p  precodeforceproxyrequest1.0 proxynokeepalive KeepAlive  KeepAliveTimeout  proxyinitialnotpooled Timeout  ProxyTimeout  codepre  pSooooo..any suggestions Thanks a million in advancep
Negative 2473 pIm at loss at how to describe this without code, so here it goesp  precode.colors.eachfunction      .getJSONmy.json, functiondata          this.csscolor, data.color       codepre  pI want the body of the codegetJSONcode callback to reference the value of codethiscode in the parent codeeachcode callback scope.p  pThis code will not work, because codethiscode will not be what it was outside the codegetJSONcode callback.

Negative 2473 pI have a process which is repeated on a set of data stored in separate folders. Each time a certain folders data is processed I need new variable names as I need to results separate after the initial processing is finished for more processing.  For example at the start of each new block of the repeated function I declare sets of arraysp  pcodeSet1  zerosdim, numbercodep  precodevectors1  zerosdim, number codepre  pFor the next set of data I needp  precodeSet2  ......... codepre  pand so on. There is going to be alot of these sets so I need a way to automate the creation of these variables, and the use the new variables names in the function whilst maintaining that they are separate once all the functions are completed. p  pI first tried using codestrcatSet1,int2strnumber  zerosdim, numbercode but this does not work, I believe because it means I would be trying to set an array as a string. Im sure there must be a way to create one function and have the variables dynamically created but it seems to be beyond me, so its probably quite obvious, so if anyone can tell me a way that would be great.p

Negative 2473 pThis is most likely a very dumb question, so my apologies in advance.  p  pI have a potential client that has had others make the claim that the values we receive from certain Android devices magnetic sensor can be put through a formula using Time to actually calculate nearby voltage.  The idea is to test fairly small voltage amounts around 57v using the device when held near it.p  pI have looked through documentation after documentation, and we have played around with existing calculations that some people have offered, but nothing seems to solidly work.  It does seem interesting that the XYZ values do indeed change dramatically when held close to the voltageproducer they seem to go into the negative for the most part, but there doesnt seem to be a solid way to convert the values to voltage, when I take into account what those xyz values are when held away from the source of voltage they stay around the same, but only positive. p  pI understand that the actual magnetic field can be found via the formula SQRTx2y2z2, but I have not found a solid algorithm for converting that to voltage.p  pSorry again for the dumb question, but is something like this even possible  I figured this was the right place to ask.  Thanks so much in advancep

Negative 2473 pWe all know about tools, 3rdparty or built in to the OS, for treating compressed files as folders.  But does anyone know how to do the reverse trick the OS into thinking that a standard folder containing some files is actually a zipped file  Solutions for Windows, Linux and Mac are sought though I realize no single solution will work across all these platforms.p  pThe context of the question is in getting source code version control systems like SVN, Git or Mercurial to be more efficient at storing diffs between versions of documents that are actually compressed folders holding various XML files, a bit of metadata and a thumbnail or two, such as ODT and DOCX.p  pI already know about Zipdoc and similar utils that use the Git and Mercurial encodedecode hooks to transform data into and out of the repository.  This is a fine solution to the problem but I found myself wanting to browse the repository containing the uncompressed folder contents of the document and individually diff the files therein.p  pThis means the uncompressed contents must be added to the repository, not the tard or zippedwithoutcompression version of the document.  This in turn means a checkout from the repository produces an uncompressed folder full of files that represent the document.  Hence my original question.p  pThe mythical product I envision would detect a folder whose name contains a registered extension docx for example and then remounts it as a compressed file of the same name.p  pAlternately, does anyone know how to exploit the GitMercurial encodedecode hooks to achieve this dreamp

Negative 2473 pOk so here is my scenario. p  pI have made a WCF Library project. Configured my app.config file. I then created a new console application. Added my WCF Library project to the console app. Then I copied the config file over to my server console app. However, when I run the console application it throws an exception and essentially states that it cant see the app.config file. However, the app.config is clearly inside of the server console application. I can add my endpoints programmatically and make the service work. However, that is not my intention.

It seems maybe more common on the iPad, but Im not sure.pli lipRestarting the device is the emONLYem way to fix the problem. Restarting the app does nothing, deleting the app and reinstalling does nothing, has to be a power down and turn back on.pli lipA few weeks ago in an attempt to blindly fix  I dumped the Cocos2d Sound engine and switched one of the apps over to ObjectAL another openAL based sound engine, hoping it might have fixed the problem.  It did not, same issue is occurring.  As youd note, both of these are just interfaces for OpenAL.pli lipThe sound files themselves were converted from wavs to cafs using Apples recommend method  a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryioscodinghowtosAudioAndVideoindex.html relnofollowhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryioscodinghowtosAudioAndVideoindex.htmla , although we also used the c 1 flag to make them single channel.pli lipJust to be clear, the bug has nothing to do with the usual sound issues mute switch, volume.  A portion of the sounds continue playing fine, but they will never all play again until the device is powered down and restarted.pli ul  pIf anyone has any ideas Id all, Id be very grateful for the help.

Negative 2473 pI have the current scenario to deal with I have to schedule the backup of my companys Linuxbased server under Suse Linux with ARCServe R15 installed on Windows 2003R2SP2. I know I have the ability in my backup software ARCServe to add prepost execution scripts to my backupjobs.  If failure of the script, ARCServe would be specified NOT to run the backupjob, and if success, specified to be run. I have no problem with this.p  pThe problem is, I want to make a windows script to be launched by ARCServe for executing a Linux script on the cluster  If this Linuxscript fails, I want my windowsscript to fail, so my backup job in ARCServe wouldnt run  If the Linuxscript success, I want my windowsscript to end normally with error code 0, so my ARCServe job would run normally. Ive tried creating this batch file lets call it HPC.batp  pecho ONp  pstart wait CProgram FilesPUTTYplink.exe v l root i CISTadminscriptsHPCpri.ppk [clustername] appliadminbackupadminp  pexit errorlevel p  pIf I manually launch this .bat by doubleclicking on it, or launching it in a command prompt under Windows, it executes normally and then ends. If I make it being launched by ARCServe, the script seems never to end.  My job stays in waiting status, it seems the execution code of the linux script isnt returned to my batch file, and this one doesnt close. In my mind, whats happening is plink just opens the connection to the Linux, send the sript execution signal, and then close the connection, so the execution code cant be returned to the batch. Am I right p  pIs what I want to do possible or am I trying something impossible to do  So, do I have to proceed differently  Do I have to use PUTTY or CygWin instead of plink  Please, its giving me headaches ...p

Negative 2473 pEver since switching to Mac based RoR development,  I occasionally see that Webrick dies after simply printing Illegal Instruction 4.  p  pOSX 10.7.2, 10.7.3 and now 10.7.4p  pruby 1.9.2p290p  prails 3.2.2, and various other version starting with 3.1p  pSo far,  its been rather innocuous,  I just hit the up arrow key, hit enter, and restart the server,  and everything is fine.p  pIve noticed that immediately after adding a new file to the development environment will almost always cause this condition.  But it has happened when I havent recently added a new file.  But it almost always happens immediately after some file change.  Put another way,  I dont think its ever happened when Im just testing stuff,  it seems that some kind of filesystem change is required to trigger this.p  pJust now,  it happened,  but this time it seems to of wedged up Webrick in some way,  and after restarting Webrick,  it wouldnt respond,  I had to reboot to clear the condition.

Negative 2473 pSo, I have this game, written in Unity, which is supposed to receive data in realtime over UDP. The data will be coming over wireless from an android device, written in Java, while the Unity program is written in C. My problem is, whenever I try to declare a codeUdpClientcode object, and call its codeReceivecode method inside the codeUpdatecode method of Unity, the game hangs.

Works like magic emif all I have to do is receive theem codebytecode emarrayem. No issues. Except that I also need the data received to be used as parameters to functions used in the actual game for now, lets just say I need to display the received data bytes as a string in the main game window.

Negative 2473 pI am using the jQuery dataTables plugin to build advanced tables for our application. One of the requirements is to have collapsible rows not groups e.g. rows represent campaigns, and they might have child campaigns. The structure of child rows is in basic case the same as in the parent table  same cells, same data types.p  pBut, the child rows shouldnt affect the parent table itself I mean, the number of rows per page should remain the same, child rows shouldnt be sorted separately from the parent row, they should always remain binded. Therefore I cant use strongfnAddDatastrong API func for that.p  pAnd the other tricky requirement is the possibility to have multilevel collapsible rows e. g. child campaigns for child campaigns, etc.p  pI was using the strongfnOpenstrong API function for that, it allows to open any row, appends a child  block to it, and you can generally insert there whatever you want. It was working just fine in dataTables 1.8.2, i used code like this to generate child rowsp  precodechildRowData.eachfunction     row  oTable.fnOpenrow.get0, this, childrow     row.addClasschildrow  codepre  pGenerally, it opened the current row defined above, inserted data in the child row, then in the cycle opened the child row, added a child to it, etc.p  pBut as of dataTables 1.9.0 looks like it is allowed only to open the parent rows, and only do it once.p  pOf course, I can create a subtable, apply strong.dataTablestrong to it and insert it to the child row, but it seems like a somewhat lame and expensive solution, especially when we might have 34 levels of depth.p  pIs there any other way to implement collapsible rows in dataTablesp

Negative 2473 pI have a very large .json file on disk.  I want to instantiate this as a Java object using the Jackson parser.p  pThe file looks like thisp  precode[  prop1 somevalue,     prop2 someothervalue,     somethingrandom [        ... arbitrary list of objects containing keyvalue             pairs of differing amounts and types ...     ]   ,    ... repated many times ...       ] codepre  pBasically its a big array of objects and each object has two string properties that identify it, then another inner array of objects where each object is a random collection of properties and values which are mostly strings and ints, but may contain arrays as well.p  pDue to this object layout, there isnt a set schema I can use to easily instantiate these objects.  Using the org.json processor requires attempting to allocate a string for the entire file, which often fails due to its size.  So Id like to use the streaming parser, but I am completely unfamiliar with it.p  pWhat I want in the end is a Map where the String is the value of prop1 and SomeObject is something that holds the data for the whole object toplevel array entry.  Perhaps just the JSON which can then be parsed later on when it is neededp  pAnyway, ideas on how to go about writing the code for this are welcome.  p

Negative 2473 pI have a problem where im initialising a variable on the scope in a controller. Then it gets changed in another controller when a user logs in. This variable is used to control things such as the navigation bar and restricts access to parts of the site depending on the type of user, so its important that it holds its value. The problem with it is that the controller that initialises it, gets called again by angular some how and then resets the variable back to its initial value. p  pI assume this is not the correct way of declaring and initialising global variables, well its not really global, so my question is what is the correct way and is there any good examples around that work with the current version of angularp

Negative 2473 pIm currently trying to write as a part of simple multiplayer game as an example of real time clientserver application assignment multiplayer game server for simple fastpaced game for few players less than 20 i think. Im using TCP sockets for packets that require guaranteed delivery ie. chat messages, login and logout requests, ping packets, etc and UDP for everything that does not necessarily need to be delivered since only the last packet that got through is important ie. user input, game world and objects updates, etc.p  pI should mention here, how my game world looks like. Every object server side has its id, role and owner members. Id is basically identifier for clients so, once I send them object updates they know which object to update on their side. Owner is information about object owner, ie. player which controls the actor. I use it to remove orphaned objects once player loses connection  logs out. Most objects however has this value set to Server. And finally role determines whether object is important to clients. This can be set to ServerSide for objects that do not need to be replicated to clients as they are only used in server side game state calculation, RelevantToOwner this objects get replicated only to their owner, ie. player private inventory does not need to be replicated to everyone, RelevantToList object gets replicated to all players from list, ie. i have list of players to whom the object is visible and i replicate only to them and RelevantToAll replicate to everyone.p  pWhen user sends login packet I check whether I have free slot and if yes, then I replicate world to him send current world state  every object that does not have role set as ServerSide or RelevantToList  unless of course the client is on the list for that object. p  pThen after each iteration of server game state update loop I send exactly same thing  whole world state.p  pWhen users send logout packet I remove him from logged in clients, free slot, and remove all orphaned objects from game world objects that had this user as owner.p  pHere are my questionsp  ul liIs this model suitable for realtime multiplayer game or am I doing it horribly wrongli liIs there a way to reduce amount of packets sent after the initial world replication ie. updating only objects which state has changed since last iteration. Ive given it a thought and so far Ive encountered one huge problem with this approach  if UDP packet from previous iteration is lost and state of the object havent changed in subsequent iterations, the object will not be updated on the player side.li liHow can i pack multiple object updates into one packet Im currently sending one object  packet which is inefficient and also probably horribly wrong.li liCould someone point me to some working example source would be nice of strongsimplestrong ClientServer game so I can see how professionals do it C or C would be nice but Java  C  Python are fine too.li ul

Negative 2473 pI have a rails application using coderake dbseedcode too fill in some of the basics in my DB to start working. This works through a little infrastructure and a fixtures.rb someone else wrote to load a YAML into the DB.br What Im trying to do is take this infrastructure and move it into my own gem so that I can use it again elsewhere, this requires me both to have some of my own gems models be inserted through the gems seed task which I want to have run from calling codedbseedcode or something similar in the main app and that the main app push some of the gems models using its own seed. The second part of this I already have working, it was a simple fix in the fixtures.rb file I was given. The things I want to do nowp  ul liMove fixtures.rb into the gem I still dont have any of the source running this in the gem. Now to do this I can probably require the file from the code[MyGemEngine.root, lib, ...].joincode then call a method there with a path to load YAML files from into the DB, which I dont see why it shouldnt work.li liGet coderake dbseedcode to run a task defined in my gem. Ive added .rake files under libtasks of my gem its an engine and I cant seem to call them from the main app rakefile though.br To make myself clear, what I want to do is through the gem not the main app  or with 1 line of code in the main app add a dependency onto the main apps seed task, so that when someone runs coderake dbseedcode in the main app the gem will run additional seeding without the main app developer even having to know about them.li ul  pThe dirty solution that I want to avoid is loading the .rake files from the gem inside the main app, or loading a seeds.rb in the gem from the one in the main app.p  pSo what Im asking is basically how to make the coderake dbseedcode task do things defined within my gemified engine just by having the gem required in the gemfilep

Negative 2473 pI have a website running behind a Varnish proxy.  Any connection open for serversent events never gets any content and never closes.

Negative 2473 pMigrating from OpenGL ES1.1 to 2.0 for 2D purposes orthographic, and Im having a little trouble figuring out how apply transformations matrix multiplication order. I only need rotation on the Zaxis, and scaling on X and Y which is the always the same value, so this should simplify things significantly. My current method ES1.1 which works perfect has a virtual camera, located in the same absolute coordinate space as objects.p  pAt the beginning of each frame I first do the cameras transforms by callingp  precode    glRotatefangle, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f     glScalefzoom, zoom, 0.0f     glTranslatefpos.x, pos.y, 0.0f  negative position to shift everything back to the center of the view codepre  pFor objects, it looks like this omitting the texture and drawing calls.p  precode   glPushMatrix  to preserve camera transform    glTranslatefpos.x, pos.y, 0.0f    glScalefscale, scale, 0.0f    glRotatefangle, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f     drawing done here    glPopMatrix codepre  pIm trying to get this same functionaly in ES2.0, but all the matrix operations have to be performed manually.p  pFrom a hrefhttpdbin.comblog201104camerasonopengles2x relnofollowthis linka I found that the proper order of multiplaction should be strongScale  Rotation  Translationstrongp  pFollowing that I came up with a single matrix formula that combines all of those, since 2D is much simpler. I also have included an orthographic projection matrix. For a test shader I have thisp  precode   attribute vec4 position    attribute vec4 color     varying vec4 colorVarying     uniform vec2 translate    uniform float rotate    uniform float scale    uniform vec4 camera  x, y, z  angle, w  zoom     void main              const float w  3.2         const float h  4.8          mat4 projection  mat41.0w, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0,                        0.0, 1.0h, 0.0, 0.0,                        0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0,                        0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0          float s1  scale  sinrotate         float s2  scale  cosrotate          mat4 m  mat4s2, s1, 0.0, 0.0,               s1, s2, 0.0, 0.0,               0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0,               translate.x, translate.y, 0.0, 1.0          glPosition  projection  m  position          colorVarying  color    codepre  pWhich works just like its supposed to for every degree of freedom. However, I cannot figure out how to incorporate the camera. The order of multiplication of the matrices in the shader does not match the order of the gl calls, so Im not sure how to convert my camera calls into multiplication. At first I was also trying to calculate a seperate tranformation matrix for the camera, and set the final position like thisp  precode    glPosition  projection  cam  m  position codepre  pWhich I dont think is right regardless of the order for the camera matrix itself I tried multiple ways, none worked right. I believe all the camera and object modelview transforms must be compiled into a single modelview matrix each matrix multiplied by the last, starting with camera tranforms, then object, but obviously in a specific order. This order of operations is what Im confused about, espcially since it doesnt match up with what was working properly in ES1.1.p  pCould someone explain the proper order, and why the gl calls are different than the actual multiplicationp

Cash transactions and Check Transactions both have the same ValueMember. What decides the 2 apart are if the Check Number column has a value or Not.. My problem is easy to see here. The ValueMember for both being the same makes using the DisplayMember to set the values for the ones that have a checkNumber required.

Negative 2473 pnewish CakePHP user here. I havent been able to find a solution to this issue.p  pI would like to embed a login form as an element in an existing page. I am using the CakeDC user plugin. The goal is to embed the login form in the page and then, when they log in, update some content on the page without refreshing the page. Before we get to worrying about AJAX and SecurityComponent, I would like to at least get the form embedded on some other page as an element.p  pFor starters, I tried to straight up copy and paste the contents of ViewsUserslogin.ctp into the element. This gave me an warning of undefined variable Model, so I hardcoded the model as Users.User because I assumed that the notation for accessing a model inside a plugin was plugin.model like they said in the manual. This failed with the error message Error emUsers.usersController could not be found.emp  pSo, I adjusted the form to take User as the model instead of model and the request now gets blackholed. If I disable the security component, I can log in successfully. This isnt quite a satisfactory solution I mean, I could opt to not validate the form or define login as an unlocked action, but if I do that, then I may as well not have security enabled for login, right.p  pHere is the code for appPluginUsersViewElementslogin.ctpp  precodeltdiv classusers indexgt lth2gtltphp echo dusers, Login gtlth2gt ltfieldsetgt     ltphp         echo thisgtFormgtcreateUser, array             action gt login,             id gt LoginForm         echo thisgtFormgtinputUser.email, array             label gt dusers, Email         echo thisgtFormgtinputUser.password,  array             label gt dusers, Password          echo ltpgt . dusers, Remember Me . thisgtFormgtcheckboxrememberme . ltpgt         echo ltpgt . thisgtHtmlgtlinkdusers, I forgot my password, arrayaction gt resetpassword . ltpgt          echo thisgtFormgtenddusers, Submit     gt ltfieldsetgt codepre  pp  pFollowing is the code for the View that is calling the elementp  precodeltdiv idloginformgt ltphp echo thisgtelementUsers.login gt ltdivgt codepre  pIf I copy and paste the element code into a View say, in codeappsPluginUsersViewUserslogin.ctpcode, it works regardless of whether Security is on or off, so I suspect some monkeying around with the form or Security calls is in order.p  pAny ideas or help would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 2473 pThis post is similar to an earlier post about preventing the corruption of PGP binary files when transferring those files to an FTP server using C httpstackoverflow.comquestions7353993ftpchangingpgpfileduringtransferincsharp, though Im asking a  different question.p  pSummaryp  pIve fixed the source of the PGP file corruption by textarmoring all of my PGP encrypted files however, I have a bunch of PGP binary files that were encrypted and uploaded to my FTP server prior to implementing this fix.  Knowing the code used to upload the files to the FTP server and the software used to manage the FTP server, is it possible to fix the corrupted PGP binary files so that they can be decrypted and recoveredp  pDetails 1 I have PGP encrypted files that were encrypted using Gpg4Win that are not textarmored they are binary files that were uploaded from an IIS 6.0 webserver using VB .NET code included below to a CoreFTP server.  p  p2 I do not have unencrypted copies of these files.  They were encrypted in memory on the webserver before being uploaded to the CoreFTP server.  Thus, I need to decrypt the binary PGP files, otherwise the data in the files will be lost.p  p3 The binary in the PGP files has been corrupted such that, even though I have the correct PGP private key, I cannot decrypt the files in Gpg4Win.  Gpg4Win is not able to find  read the PGP data in the encrypted binary files.  p  p4 I am able to successfully decrypt more recent PGP encrypted files that were textarmored the binary data was stored in base64 notation before uploading to the CoreFTP server.  Therefore, the decryption problem is most likely due to file corruption rather than any issue with Gpg4Win or my PGP private  public key pair.p  p5 Several binary file recovery programs that Ive tried to use on the PGP binary files say that they cannot find the file data and are unable to fix the binary file corruption.  Or, they do not make any alteration to the binary data contained in the PGP binary files.p  pVB .net code used to upload PGP binary filesp  precodePublic Function UploadFileByVal localFileName As String, ByVal FTPFilename As String, ByVal UseBinary As Boolean, ByVal uniqueName As Boolean, ByRef StatusDescription As String As FtpStatusCode     Dim request As FtpWebRequest  CTypeFtpWebRequest.CreateFTPFilename, FtpWebRequest     request.Credentials  New NetworkCredentialUsername, Password      If uniqueName Then         request.Method  WebRequestMethods.Ftp.UploadFileWithUniqueName     Else         request.Method  WebRequestMethods.Ftp.UploadFile     End If     request.UseBinary  UseBinary      Dim ff As New FileInfolocalFileName      Dim fileContentsConvert.ToInt32ff.Length As Byte      Using fr As FileStream  ff.OpenRead         fr.ReadfileContents, 0, fileContents.Length     End Using      Using writer As Stream  request.GetRequestStream         writer.WritefileContents, 0, fileContents.Length     End Using     Dim response As FtpWebResponse  CTyperequest.GetResponse, FtpWebResponse     StatusDescription  response.StatusDescription      Return response.StatusCode End Function codepre  pFor my FTP server Im using the latest version of CoreFTP for Windows.  p  pWhen responding to the FTP LIST command, CoreFTP returns the file information in Unix format rather than the MSDOS format, so Im wondering if the binary corruption was the result of transferring a binary file from a Windows server that uses MSDOS formatting for binary files to an FTP server that uses a Unix format.  However, I have not experienced any issues opening  reading nonPGP binary files uploaded from my webserver to the CoreFTP server.p  pThank you Isaacp

Negative 2473 pI have an image with a transparent border, and I am trying to directly manipulate the image pixels, following the Apple guide found a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibrarymacqaqa1509index.html relnofollowherea. Everything works perfectly well when run on the device. However, when I run my code on the simulator, I find that the transparent border of the image slowly turns black with each call to this function. The strange thing is that even if I dont modify the image data, the transparent border still begins to turn black with each call to this function. For example, I see the same problem even if my image manipulation code calls codeCGBitmapContextGetDatacode but doesnt use the returned data pointer. To make the problem go away on the simulator, I have to comment out the call to codeCGBitmapContextGetDatacode and the freeing of the data pointer of course. Example code that still modifies the image on the simulatorp  precode UIImage  updateImageUIImage inputImage      UIImage updatedImage       Update colors in image appropriately      CGImageRef image  [inputImage CGImage]      CGContextRef cgctx  [ColorHandler CreateARGBBitmapContextimage]     if cgctx  NULL               error creating context         NSLogError creating context.n         return nil           sizet w  CGImageGetWidthimage     sizet h  CGImageGetHeightimage     CGRect rect  0,0,w,h       Draw the image to the bitmap context.

Negative 2473 pI tried searching for an answer first, but this seems to be an edge case.p  pIm adding a class to a link via JavaScript well jQuery actually but I dont think it matters in this case. The class adds an icon as a background image and some padding. The padding and background image fail to appear on certain links. The problem shows up in IE8, but surprisingly works fine in IE7. I cant test IE910. Works fine in Firefox.p  pI reduced the code down to a bare minimum and created a jsFiddle that illustrates the problem.  a hrefhttpjsfiddle.nettoxalotfsdcu relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.nettoxalotfsdcuap  pIll try adding the code here.p  precodeltstyle typetextcssgt body  backgroundcolor fff  ahover  backgroundcolor transparent color c30  ul  paddingleft 40px  .iconNewWindowLeave  paddingright 15px backgroundcolor ccc  ltstylegt ltulgt     ltli stylefloat leftgtlta classiconNewWindowLeave hrefgtleft linkltagtltligt     ltli styletextalign rightgtsome stuff on the rightltligt ltulgt ltulgt     ltli stylefloat leftgtlta classlinkExternal hrefgtleft linkltagtltligt     ltli styletextalign rightgtsome stuff on the rightltligt ltulgt ltscript typetextjavascriptgt .linkExternal.eachfunction      this.addClassiconNewWindowLeave  ltscriptgt codepre  pIve removed the image from the example and added a background color for illustration. In IE 8, the second link doesnt have right padding. Hovering over the link, adds the padding. If I remove the ahover CSS, hovering doesnt correct the problem. If I remove the float, the problem goes away. If I remove any of the other CSS, the problem goes away.p  pSo Ive narrowed down the causes, but I dont know what to do about it. I dont want to remove or change the existing code. Its all required for the site layout. If possible, Id like to emaddem some CSS or JavaScript to fix it. Its a minor issue, but its bugging me. Im also curious as to whether or not the problem appears in newer versions of IE.p

Negative 2473 pMy ASP.NET MVC 4 application uses Entity Framework v5, the Ninject and Ninject.MVC3 nuget packages, and data is being stored in SQL Server Express.  Models were generated using the EF 5.x DbContext Generator for C template. Lazy Loading Enabled is set to True in my edmx.p  pIm using the repository pattern, with my repository and context living in a separate project in my solution that is referenced by the ASP.NET MVC 4 project.p  pSo, the problem  after saving a new object Trade thats a property of a view model, I query the repository for that object. At that point, the navigation properties I would expect to be populated are null.  See the comment in the Create method below.p  pIf I retrieve an existing Trade from the db one that I didnt just save, all the navigation properties seem to be populated.p  pI found a report of a similaridentical problem on a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comArticles396822BasicHandlingandTipsofDatabaseRelationships relnofollowthis pagea. The author of the article states, I think this is a glitch in DbContext. Namely, Lazy loading for the foreign key navigation property doesnt work for the newly added item, but the lazy loading for the navigation property in the many end works fine, such as Teacher.Classes. This glitch occurs only for the newly added item. If you dont load Class.Teacher explicitly above for the newly added item, it will be null if it hasnt been loaded somewhere in Entity Framework. However, if it is loaded already somewhere, then C.Teacher can be automatically resolved by Entity Framework. Whereas, for ObjectContext, lazy loading is fine for all types of navigation properties.p  pMy controllers Create method looks like thisp  precode[HttpPost] public ActionResult CreateTradeViewModel tradeViewModel      if ModelState.IsValid              employeesRepository.SaveTradetradeViewModel.Trade         var trade              employeesRepository.Trades.First                 x gt                 x.RequesterId  tradeViewModel.Trade.RequesterId ampamp                 x.RequesterWorkDate  tradeViewModel.Trade.RequesterWorkDate           Null reference encountered below, as trade.TradeType and trade.Employee are both null         String userMessage  New   trade.TradeType.TradeTypeDescription   requested with   ControllerHelpers.GetDisplayNametrade.Employee           TempData[UserMessage]  userMessage          return RedirectToActionIndex          return View  codepre  pThe SaveTrade method in the employee repository looks likep  precodepublic void SaveTradeTrade trade      var data  from t in context.Trades                 where t.RequesterId  trade.RequesterId                       ampamp t.RequesterWorkDate  trade.RequesterWorkDate                 select t     if data.Any              context.Trades.Addtrade          context.SaveChanges  codepre  pAnd finally, Trades in employeesRepository looks likep  precodepublic IQueryableltTradegt Trades      get  return context.Trades   codepre

Negative 2473 pI have a tabbed application for iPad. On the first tab I have a separate menu with a pointer that highlights the currently active menu button. The pointer a UIImage is animated into position after tapping the button.p  pThe problem is when you leave the highlighted image on any button thats not the originaldefault button and move to another tab in the application, then back again, the image has moved back to the default location. However, when you tap another button the image moves in the wrong direction. I think its because the image moves back but the old coordinates are retained, or the other way around Its a bit hit and miss and behaves differently testing in the simulator compared to directly on the iPad.p  pI think I need to start with absolute coordinates and stick with them throughout the process. But I cant get my head around how to achieve it with the CGAffine functions.p  pHere is my current codep  precode IBActiondiplayForm1idsender       [UIView beginAnimationsnil contextNULL]     [UIView setAnimationDuration0.5]     buttonHighlightImage.transform  CGAffineTransformMakeTranslation0, 0     [UIView commitAnimations]     IBActiondiplayForm2idsender       [UIView beginAnimationsnil contextNULL]     [UIView setAnimationDuration0.5]     buttonHighlightImage.transform  CGAffineTransformMakeTranslation0, 80     [UIView commitAnimations]     IBActiondiplayForm3idsender       [UIView beginAnimationsnil contextNULL]     [UIView setAnimationDuration0.5]     buttonHighlightImage.transform  CGAffineTransformMakeTranslation0, 160     [UIView commitAnimations]   codepre  pEDIT   p  pMundi I tried the code you suggested. Im assuming by newFrame you mean define a new UIImageView and property which I did in the .h I called it sfh, then synthesize in the .m.p  pThis is my code in the .mp  precodevoidviewWillAppearBOOLanimated        The pointer and the old frame are the same so I thought it pointless to do      selectedFormHighlight.frame  selectedFormHighlight.frame       I tried anyway and also tried this and many other combinations     selectedFormHighlight.frame  sfh.frame    voidviewDidAppearBOOLanimated       [UIView beginAnimationsnil contextNULL]     [UIView animateWithDuration0.3 animations         selectedFormHighlight.frame  CGRectMake0,0,0,0     ]     [UIView commitAnimations]   codepre  pWhen I run this the pointer animates off the screen topleft and doesnt come back. I have tried every possible combination I can think of in viewWillAppear and viewDidAppear but it makes no difference. I tried removing the other lines in viewDidAppear and it still does the same thing.p  pI think youre suggesting to animate the pointer from the original default position when the user returns from another screen. I dont want that, it should simply remain in the same spot where they left it without animation. Or at least put it back there without them realizing it. The only animation is when they choose to tap a different button within that view.p

Negative 2473 pIm new to socket programming and somewhat to Python too and Im having trouble getting the select timeout to work the way I want to on the server side. Before clients connect, timeout works just fine. I give it a value of 1 second and the timeout expires in my loop every 1 second.p  pOnce a client connects, however, it doesnt wait 1 second to tell me the timeout expires. It just loops as fast as it can and tells me the timeout expires. Heres a snippet of my codep  precodewhile running     try         self.timeoutexpired  False         inputready, outputready, exceptready  select.selectself.inputs, self.outputs, [], self.timeout     except select.error, e         break     except socket.error, e         break      if not inputready          Timeout expired         print Timeout expired         self.timeoutexpired  True       Additional processing follows here codepre  pIm not sure if this is enough code to see where my problem is, so please let me know if you need to see more. Basically, after a client connects, it at least emappearsem that it ignores the timeout of 1 second and just runs as fast as it can, continuously telling me Timeout expired. Any idea what Im missingp  pThanks muchp  pEdit I should clarify...inputready represents input from a client connecting or sending data to the server, as well as stdin from the server. The other variables returned from select are only serverside variables, and is what Im trying to do is detect whether the CLIENT took too long to reply, so Im only checking if inputready is empty.p

The respective code compiles without warnings and errors on several other newer g versions, as well as on clang. It is simply correct and the bug was mentioned in the GCCs bugzilla even several times, because it seems to recurr often, but no workaround was provided.p  pPlease dont tell also to use a newer g. I strongMUSTstrong compile it on the g shipped with Ubuntu Hardy, so I cannot change the compiler. Main development is done on Ubuntu Precise, but I need to keep it compatible to Hardy.p  pI have no idea what a thunk should be, I only suspect it has to do with covariants andor multiple inheritance. Also I have several more similar structured header files, which all compile well, despite the only change is the name is the name of the class and I have no aim, to change that because of a compiler bug on Hardy.p  pAnother fact is, it happens at include time.p  precodeIn file included from homeheikohglsrccompilercompilerprojectfactory.cpp18 homeheikohglsrccompilercompilertype.h In instantiation of HGLCompilerCompilerTypeltHGLVector2D, HGLCompilerCompilerBasegt homeheikohglsrccompilercompilervector2d.h23 instantiated from here homeheikohglsrccompilercompilertype.h22 internal compiler error in makethunk, at cpmethod.c129 Please submit a full bug report, with preprocessed source if appropriate.

Negative 2473 pI have asked this quesion few days before here and no one answered it. br  I had asked it in codeforum.javascriptMVC.comcode too and now I have a answer, however I need a a bit more idea.p  pQuestionp  precodeI read javascriptMVCs documents and I loved it.  But I dont know how to use it in a large scale project. codepre  pI think on the serverside a MVC framework is needed or can help so much. And Ive worked with server side PHP frameworks.p  pI am confused, my understanding of JavascriptMVC projects is that they handle client side events on the browser capture events, execute  AJAX requests, manage the responsesdata from the server and also show them to user in a graphical interface. p  pI know that in PHP MVC projects we also have controllers and actions that any of them is a separate page with a single entry point, my point is that these pages are whole HTTP requests.p  pI think the combination of these two frameworks would be in a form of a strongsinglestrong or emfewem heavy files including js , css , imgs etc that loads and managed by another Javascript libary such as steal.js.  Now user can work with site and its actions as events that result in running js functions that may change something in the UI or cause a AJAX request, as in Yahoo Mail where most things happens in emoneem page.p  pSo how will this affect the design of controllers and actions in PHP  I mean normally in PHP MVC frameworks a lot of controllers and actions means a lot of pages. I think because of AJAX the number of controllers and actions should be actually less. I also think because of JMVC most controllers and actions should turn to AJAX responders, however how are layouts and views to be handled in this contextp  pFinallyp  ul liI want to know about different aspects of using this methodJMVCMVC. I am using Yii as my serverside MVC framework and JavascriptMVC as my clientside MVC. li liI also want to know about management of data on the clientside.li liI would like to understand how AJAX and websockets could be used, where we can use AJAX and where we can use websockets. li liI want to understand about localstorage how we can use it for simulated page data management and maybe caching, how we can cache data coming from server as JSON in a form of a page I am working on a very large project and I want to build its foundation very strong.li ul

Negative 2473 pI am trying to filter out some points from a dimension in my MDX select query.

Could you kind folks please point out what is wrong with my syntax. I have also tried the Except, . p  pBest, Rohanp  pUPDATE p  pThanks to Marc , for pointing me in the right direction. I tested some more and found out that the Members function also returns a point All which includes all the points on my dimension. So hence, even though the Filter or the Except functions were filtering the points properly, the All point still contained the value for all points and hence was including them in the Measure.AMOUNT calculation. I instead used the Children function and that does not return the All point so I see the desired result.

At the last minute, before moving the site, I changed the theme folder name. This broke a lot of instances throughout the theme where it referred to a path through that folder, so I had to fix those. I used a a hrefhttpinterconnectit.comproductssearchandreplaceforwordpressdatabases relnofollowsearch and replace toola on the DB, but there were also some instances in the CSS I found that had to be fixed manually. Also, when I tried to import the SQL DB into the live site via PHP myAdmin, it said there was a syntax error. That seemed over my head, so I tried to just import the WP content through their import tool and then manually set up the menus and such again.p

On roll out, Id like the intro to be shown again, but after a timeout. p  pIm having some issues with the timeout not working  the introshow function does not seem to fire.  p  pIve tried to keep the example simple  in reality the introshow function will include some animation but thats irrelevant as its the timeout function Im having issues with.

Negative 2473 pI am currently working on implementing custom headers for a UITableView in addition to the ones already available in the UITableView class So that we can have both a title header and a subtitle header floating at the top together. p  pIn order to do so, my table is divided in many sections which can either bep  ul liA title section, which is actually a section with an empty UIView as a header since I want my custom header to float over that empty view.li liOr it can be a subtitle section, which is a normal section that uses the header provided by iOS the one that already float at the top when we scroll.li ul  pBoth type of sections can have rows within them and the implementation works perfectly until I try it with 2 custom headers.p  pWhen I try adding a second custom header, I get this exception when calling the codeUITableView.RectForHeaderInSectioncode method p  blockquote   pNSInternalInconsistencyException request for rect of header in invalid section 6p blockquote  pThe thing is that I call codethis.UITableView.RectForHeaderInSection6code and, when the exception pops up on the exact same line, I can see that my table has at least 7 sections and that, therefore, the 6th section shouldnt be invalid. p  pIm using codeRectForHeaderInSectioncode to place my floating header where it should be.p  pDoes anyone have an idea why it crashes even though the section isnt supposed to be invalid Or maybe another way of getting the exact frame where i need to put my floating header which would be the frame of the empty table view header that I created in the title sectionsp  pI only found this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8734496whatdoestheioserrorrequestforrectofinvalidsectionmeanquestiona that may relate to my problem, but I dont think the source of the problem is the same in that case.p  pstrongEditstrong I realized that, when I say that the number of sections should be 7, it is the number of sections in the UITableViewSource subclass and not the actual sections in the table. Could it be possible that section are removed or just never added even though they are added to the Source How can i see the number of sections in my table other than looking at the list we have in the source p  pI will probably post a part of my code tomorrow, because right now I am aware that theres not enough information to find where the problem can be.p  pstrongEdit 2strong Heres what the code looks likep  precode first we create the custom header Title var title1  new CustomHeader  var section1  this.Table.TableSource.AddSection section1.HeaderView  title1.View  Fill section 1 with rows... var section2  this.Table.TableSource.AddSection  Fill section 2 with rows...   We create the list of sections that our Title will contain var title1Sections  new ListltTableSectiongt title1Sections.Addsection1 title1Sections.Addsection2   Now we call the method that will create our custom header this.Table.TableSource.AddHeadertitle1.View, title1Sections, this.Table.TableSource.Sections.IndexOfsection1 codepre  pso with this, we have section 1 which has a custom title header that floats over section 1 and 2. And section 2 that has a normal subtitle header which will float under the title header when they bump into each other. Now the AddHeader methodp  precodepublic void AddHeaderUIView headerView, ListltTableSectiongt sections, int indexOfFirstSection      RectangleF rectForHeaderInTableView  this.TableView.RectForHeaderInSectionindexOfFirstSection  CRASHES HERE       Code that uses rectForHeaderInTableView to make our custom header float over everything...  codepre  pIf I only have one custom header like this, the app runs fine and theres no crash. But if I add more sections lets say sections 34the same way I did here and add a custom header, when it will try to add the second custom header, the app will crash when trying to get rectForHeaderInSection. If i decide not to have a custom header for section 12 and instead have one for 34, it still works. As long as I only have one custom header, the app doesnt crash. p

I leave a bit of room for them to zoom in, but we dont need much for this type of app.p  p3 When users scrub through photos, and its fast last photo was displayed less than 0.1 seconds ago, for example, I serve up the lowquality version first and kick off a timer that pulls the highquality version of the photo say 0.1 seconds later. When users keep scrolling, they see lowversion pics you can barely tell the difference, though and as soon as they slow down enough or stop, they see fullres pic nearinstantly.p  p4 I cache the photos with NSCache, but Id really rather have 30 FPS right away rather than after the first passthrough. Plus I noticed NSCache will sometimes crash the app due to not releasing memory in lowmemory conditions fast enough, despite the documentation saying it does.p  pTo read the photos, I just usep  precode[UIImage imageWithContentsOfFilephotoCoreDataEntity.filename] codepre  pThis works pretty smooth on iPhone 5. Not so much on an iPhone 4. I dont have any multithreading yet  still trying to figure out the best way to fit it in. For example, if I put every image read request in NSOperation, I can cancel the previous operation when user scrubs to the next photo, but will it really cancel in the middle of reading from this or wait till its done reading, thus kind of making the whole idea pointless Maybe I need to read the bytes as steam on my own and check for Cancelled flag regularly...p  pAny help to solve this problem would be appreciated THANK YOUp

Negative 2473 pI am creating an adroid app and I am using AChartEngine to create some charts. I am using codeTimeChartcode to create a graph. Everything is working fine but I cannot get the labels in Y axis to change format. So instead of the values being shown like 2000.12 I want them to show like 2.000,12. If I could pass codeStringscode and not codedoublescode I could easily format it. Is there a way to do that without having to use codeaddYTextLabelcodep

Negative 2473 pUsing Breeze and Knockout together so far without problems. But just run into some really odd behaviour.p  pIts going to be hard to reproduce or post code, but Im going to ask the question anyway in the hope it rings a bell somewhere. Essentially the problem is that if I change or add an object in this particular instance, and then save, when I call ko.toJSON on the entitiy, it replaces all the newchanged objects with null values.p  pThe same serialisation code works fine for all the other objects so far, so it must be the entitiy itself which is somehow different. But looking at the objects, theres nothing obvious  although since knockout wraps everything in observables itd be hard to spot anyway.p  pApologies for the lack of information but Im badly stumped  does this ring any bells for anyonep

Negative 2473 pIn Spring 3.0.5 and before, it was possible to create a base controller test class that fetched the HandlerMapping object from the Spring Application Context to directly access and call into a controllers method via the URL. I found this approach to be really awesome because in addition to testing the controllers methods, I was also testing the path variables and such in my unitintegration tests.p  pWith Spring 3.2.4, this approach appears not to be possible any longer due to the restructuring of how Spring deals with Url mappings. I see that Spring provides a new MVC test framework, but to be honest, I think its design is too verbose and looks nothing like the rest of the framework or my application code. It also doesnt play nicely with intellisense features in IntelliJ. To be honest, Id rather not use it.p  pSo, is there an alternative way to test controller URLs that does not use the new Spring MVC test framework, like I was doing before I have an existing project with 371 controller tests, and Id REALLY like to avoid migrating everything over to use the Spring MVC test framework.p  pHere is the codehandlecode method I was using to test controllers using Spring

Negative 2473 pFrom Apples release notesp  blockquote   pAs of Seed 4, privacy support for the codeAddressBookUIcode framework is reenabled for apps linked against the iOS 7 SDK. Apps linked against older SDKs are not changed. If your app uses any of the Address Book view controllers, you should verify that it still behaves as expected.p blockquote  pThe question is what can one do if the view controllers do emnotem still behave as expected.p  pWhat does it mean to have privacy support reenabledp  pI came across this because our app can no longer access the Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync Global Address List from the codeABPeoplePickerNavigationControllercode groups. So no, it is not behaving as expected how it behaves in iOS 6.p  h2Edit this has been fixed as of iOS 7.0.3 perhaps earlierh2
Negative 2473 pIm trying to use SSANOVA for research comparing curves of F0 tracks fundamental frequency in different accent types, and I am a little stuck on how to go about it in R. I have data that gives 50 F0 points for a word in a certain accent type, and want to compare between the different curves that these accent types give. Not many people in my field seem to know a lot about how to do this, so I am a little lost. I have heard of the gss package and the assist package for doing these, but dont know which is better. Does anyone have an opinion on either of these packages, or any insight on how to go about doing an SSANOVA in Rp

Negative 2473 pWe have a social responsibility project aiming encourage young people to learn mobile application development. The main problem we face mostly is language. Most of the young people in our country dont have sufficient english knowledge to be able to search or learn something in english. Thats why our one of the biggest difference from the world wide tutoriallearning sites is being in native language. p  pAs a supporter of the project in the technical side, we answer questions, write blog posts and try to help people learn mobile application development in their native language. One of the problems i face with while helping people is the inability of providing official referencesin native language about the responses we gave. This problem pushed me thinking about translating whole android sdk documentation to our native language  I know its a huge job, we may try to crowdsourcing it i dont know but the thing i want to ask here is just suggestions about implementation of such a project.p  pWhat kind of technology would you use, how would it be possible to stay synch with the recent versions of the sdk. Do you think the current android sdk documentation pages autogenerated completely Is it just javadoc How to support multilanguages with javadoc Or with any other way p  pI hope questions will not be closed being unrelated, it is a completely technical question. p  pThanks everyonep
Negative 2473 pI have an app that started in eclipse. The package name starts with a capital, and it always compiled and installed correctly. Now that I have moved the project into android studio, while the app will compile, it wont install due to a malformed manifest. I looked up this problem, and the suggestion was to lowercase the package name. This dose solve the problem, and the app installs, but this makes no sense. Why would apps compiled in eclipse be fine with it, but the same code in Android Studio not work This is a large problem, as the app is already in the play store, and I cant lowercase the package name, so Im stuck in eclipse.

Negative 2473 pThe way I understand the compilation processp  p1 Preprocessing  All of your macros are replaced with their actual values, all comments are removed, etc. Replaces your include statements with the literal text of the files youve included.p  p2 Compilation  Wont drill down too deep here, but the result is an assembly file for whatever architecture you are on.p  p3 Assembly Takes the assembly file and converts it into binary instructions, i.e., machine code.p  p4 Linking This is where Im confused.  At this point you have an executable.  But if you actually run that executable what happens  Is the problem that you may have included .h files, and those only contain function prototypes  So if you actually call one of the functions from those files, it wont have a definition and your program will crashp  pIf thats the case, what exactly does linking emdoem, under the hood How does it find the .c file associated with the .h that you included, and how does it inject that into your machine code  Doesnt it have to go through the whole compilation process again for that filep  pNow, Ive come to understand that there are two types of linking, dynamic and static.  Is static when you actually recompile the source of the library for every executable you create  I dont quite understand how dynamic linking would work.  So you compile one executable library that is shared by all of your processes that use it  How is that possible, exactly  Wouldnt it be outside of the address space of the processes trying to access it  Also, for dynamic linking, dont you still need to compile the library at some juncture in time  Is it just sitting there constantly in memory waiting to be used  When is it compiled  p  pCan you go through the above and clear up all of the misunderstandings, wrong assumptions there and substitute your correct explanationp

They are processes as a RTL when displayed in the label, but incorrect direction detection makes inconsistent behaviour.p  h3Investigationh3  pDuring development, I have found out that when creating codeNSAttributedStringcode with no attributes except for the font and displaying it using codeTTTAttributedLabelcode, RTL text aligns to the right edge. When using simple codeNSStringcode, or when using standard codeUILabelcode with attributed string, alignment stays left. So, there has to be something in the text that says it is RTL and there is some method to detect it.p  pI analysed what I am receiving from server, and there were no standard Unicode bidi chars. This is how it looks. JSON is sent in ascii with all unicode characters escapedp  precodeu0643u062au0628u062a u0648u0648u062cu0650 .. codepre  pWhen unescaping, it looks like this, with codeu0643code is on the far right before the dotsp  precode  .. codepre  pAs far as I can tell, every character represents a single character in arabic language, and there are no codeU202Bcode or similar control characters which could be used to easily detect direction.p  pYet, when rendering this text through codeTTTAttributedLabelcode, it aligns right. I started looking into the a hrefhttpsgithub.commatttTTTAttributedLabel relnofollowsource codea, and it doesnt do anything to detect the direction or set the alignment. It only created the framesetter using codeCTFramesetterCreateWithAttributedStringcode and then, when it gets lines from it using codeCTFrameGetLinescode and line positions with codeCTFrameGetLineOriginscode, they are already aligned to the right.p  pSo, does anyone know if direction can be detected solely from the text with publicly available and preferably fast API methodsp

Negative 2473 pI have 3 codeActivitiescode, let the codeActivitycode codeAcode is the main codeActivitycode from which codeBcode and codeCcode codeActivitiescode are called. codeBcode is codeActivitycode with settings, and codeCcode is codeActivitycode with the main actions. I need to realize codeToggleButtoncode in codeBcode which is responsible for whether the device will vibrate after pressing the buttons in codeCcode. Thus, it is necessary to connect codeBcode and codeCcode. If using Intent, it is necessary to call the codeStartActivity IntentStartActivityForResult Intentcode method. From this it follows that when pressing codeToggleButtoncode in codeBcode, the codeCcode will be called by codeBcode. And it is unnecessary to me. I need that when pressing codeToggleButtoncode something was remembered somewhere, and then when the codeCcode is called it will be cause to device vibrating. How to solve this problemp

Negative 2473 pI have a Neo4j database version 2.0.0 containing words and their etymological relationships with other words. I am currently able to create word networks by traversing these word origins, using a variable depth Cypher query.p  pFor clientside performance reasons these networks are visualized in JavaScript, and because the number of relationships varies significantly from one word to the next, I would like to be able to make the depth traversal conditional on the number of nodes. My query currently looks something like thisp  precodestart anodeid match pa[rORIGINOF1..5]b where not bgt return nodesp codepre  pGoing to a depth of 5 usually yields very interesting results, but at times delivers far too many nodes for my clientside visualization to handle. Id like to check against, for example, codesumlengthnodespcode and decrement the depth if that result exceeds a particular maximum value. Or, of course, any other way of achieving this goal.p  pI have experimented with adding a codeWHEREcode clause to the path traversal, but this is specific to individual paths and does not allow me to codesumcode the total number of nodes.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 2473 pIm trying to add a Custom Task Pane in an Excel Addin which is intended to work similarly to the Pivot Tables pane.p  pThe intention is that when a Table is selected the custom pane should appear and should disappear.

In Excel 2013, it slides out from the side of the window, which takes around 500ms.p  pI cant see any way to change this behaviour  Ive tried scheduling the propertysetting on the STA Thread, but it causes the same blocking. Id be happy to change the Task Pane so that it just appears immediately without the transition like the Pivot Table pane, but I dont see anything to make that happen either.p  pAm I doing this incorrectly Is there a way to fix this with direct COM or some other subtlyhidden behaviourp

Negative 2473 pI have implemented a UISearchBar with MKlocalSearch that enables the user to search all locations within a region. I have parsed information in Json format that holds locations and the name of the business associated with that location and placed annotations at those coordinates. What I would like my SearchBar to do is only search for locations where I have placed the annotations that are within 75 miles of the users location, and not recognize any other locations if the user were to search for them. I would like the search word to be by clubName which is also a piece of information associated with each Json object. In other words if I were to search for the club Roxy it would show up in the filter if user is within 75 miles, but if I were to search for home depot nothing would show up since an annotation is not set for that location.

Negative 2473 pIm new to Angularjs so please bear with me.p  pI wanted to create a generic wizard that would allow me to walk through a process.  I started by creating a custom directive that handles pretty much all of the wizarding stuff ... steps, previous and next, etc.p  pWhile the wizard template provides a next and previous button for moving between steps, there may be some actions that would cause the controllerview using the wizard to need to indicate to the wizard that it needs to move forward or backward through a step.  I havent been able to figure out how to do that.  I thought maybe emit or broadcast might work but I think maybe Im missing something in regard to scope.p  pTake a look at this example a hrefhttpplnkr.coeditibwzeoWV9jR8Fpf7s4tmppreview relnofollowPlunker examplea  Its not pretty but it gives you the idea.

Negative 2473 pHeres what I am trying to do.  I have a page that uses CSS to showhide different content divs.  One of the divs is a form that submits a record to a database.  After clicking Submit I do not want to redirect back to the default page content, which is what would happen by calling the script in the form action and using a simple response.redirect at the end of the ASP script.  Instead I want to pass the form info off to the ASP script in an iframe or some other way and then just clear the form.  This way the user can go ahead and enter another incident in the form without having to click an Add Incident button again in the navigation to show the hidden form div which is how it loads the default page if I were to redirect back.p  pI see a couple of ways to handle this  As I mentioned above, the form data is sent off to the ASP in an iframe or some such thing.  I call the ASP script as normal, but when doing the response.redirect to default.asp, somehow also tell the page to display the form div instead of the default contentp  pIn either case, Im not sure exactly how I would do this.  Any helpp

Negative 2473 pIm currently having an issue where the user is browsing a page with a long list of items with brief detail all laid out in a table. If the user wants to see more information about the item, they can click the link to view specific details on a separate page. Each  tag has a unique id attribute. The problem Im having is that when the list is very long perhaps  100 items if the user wants to take a look at an item and then wants to click the back button, it takes them to the top of the previous page, losing their spot in the list.p  pI know there are a handful of solutions from the users end like middleclickopen in new tab, from a website design standpoint allow a smaller number of results in the table so they dont run into the problem of being so hard to find the spot they were at when they click the back button, etc.p  pI tried looking into using the History object and javascript, and thought I had seen somewhere that I could replace the LAST history entry, but all I can find are how to replace the CURRENT history entry. Ultimately what Im looking to do is replace where the back button would normally take me to with that same url with the anchor of the  element appended to the end.p  pi.e. If the user is on www.website.comlistAllItems and clicks the link for an item to go to www.website.comviewItemitemId1234, I would like to change the last history entry to be www.website.comlistAllItems1234 or similar. p  pAm I misunderstanding how the History object works Im hoping to be able to accomplish this without the use of a library. It seems like Ive been VERY close to a solution several times, but its always just a tiny bit off. Any help would be greatly appreciatedp

Negative 2473 pI have the following data modelp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comF7iUq.png altData Modelp  pMy business logic works with detached entities so Im using GraphDiff to perform updates. Im having trouble updating the PerfModesCalcPoints association. Conceptually, Block owns CalcPoints and PerfModes, but CalcPoints can be associated with any number of PerfModes.p  pIm trying to do updates at the Block level. The code I came up with doesnt throw any errors while other attempts did but neither does it update the PerfModesCalcPoints association.p  precodecontainer.UpdateGraphblock, map gt map     .OwnedCollectionb gt b.HistPoints     .OwnedCollectionb gt b.CalcPoints     .OwnedCollectionb gt b.PerfModes, with gt with         .OwnedCollectionp gt p.FilterCriterion, with2 gt with2             .OwnedCollectionfc gt fc.Filters, with3 gt with3                 .AssociatedEntityf gt f.OperatorType                 .AssociatedEntityf gt f.CalcPoint         .AssociatedCollectionp gt p.CalcPoints  codepre  pI probably dont have a full grasp of EF graphs and GraphDiff.

I switched back to my original mappings and still saw the issue of the association not updating, so it seems theres a problem with trying to update the entire model at once. Id be fine with making multiple UpdateGraph calls, but what would be the best way to break them outp  pa hrefhttpsgist.github.comanonymousf64e63497ee5bc5ddad1 relnofollowHeresa a gist with relevant code and a failing unit test.p  pIm inheriting the EF generated container class to create my own context with proxy creation disabled.

Negative 2473 pI am trying to make a web page that allows the user to submit information about an object using input boxes and a save button. So far I have found it relatively easy to get the page to work for names, numbers etc. using basic types like strings, integers, booleans and doubles. I can enter this basic information into the input boxes and get the information to save into the database by hitting the save button. p  pHowever, the last input field that I need to get working is the Location field. This field is saved as a complex type called LatLng containing Latitude and Longitude values. I have been able to get the input boxes to display properly using the razor HTML form element EditorFor. It automatically creates two input boxes one for Lat and one for Long.p  pEXp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comAqEUL.png altenter image description here p  pBut it seems that no matter what I input into these boxes the value stored in the database is always lat0, long0. p  pBy setting a break point in my model file I have found out that the by the time it gets to the model the value variable inside the set in Location is already 0,0. p  pSo my Question is Is there something wrong with my code that would cause the value passed from the EditorFor text boxes to be zeroed before reaching my model file Or is there some way that will allow me to debug this deeperp  pThis code is from my view page.

I am working at my JSonlylightbox to support multiple images  a hrefhttpsgithub.comfelixhagspieljsOnlyLightbox relnofollowhttpsgithub.comfelixhagspieljsOnlyLightboxa for those who are interested . So I am not using jQuery. Now I want to add the possibility to add animations via CSS3transitions.  What I do is to add the class codejslghtbxanimatingnextcode to the image inside the lightbox, once the nextarrow has been clicked. The image has an codetransition all .6s easeinoutcode property, and the class codejslghtbxanimatingnextcode contains nothing but codemarginleft 100code. But the image isnt animated, it just pops to the new position. On the other hand, when I use opacity instead, it works. When I apply the marginleftproperty via firebug, the animation also works. I thought maybe it is because the image has codemarginleft autocode per default, but removing that didnt do the trick. p  pTestingserver a hrefhttptesting.felixhagspiel.deindex.html relnofollowhttptesting.felixhagspiel.deindex.htmlap  pZipFile a hrefhttptesting.felixhagspiel.dejsOnlyLightbox.rar relnofollowhttptesting.felixhagspiel.dejsOnlyLightbox.rarap  pYou have to click on one of the images below the headline Use groups to show multiple images and then click on the right arrow only nextfunction is in there so far.

Negative 2473 pA question related to the C.NET compiler used in Visual Studio 2010 During the development of a project, a colleague encountered a situation where the VS2010 compiler would crash when using existing code inside a lock. We took the code apart linebyline to eventually come to the conclusion that using a codeyield returncode inside a codeforeachcode through an array within a lock statement would crash the compiler. The issue can be reproduced with the following codep  precodeusing System using System.Collections.Generic  namespace PlayGround      public static class Program              private static readonly object SyncRoot  new object          private static IEnumerableltintgt EnumerableWithLock                      lock SyncRoot                              foreach var i in new int[1]                                      yield return i                                                 public static void Main                      foreach var i in EnumerableWithLock                              Console.WriteLinei                             codepre  pWe continued to test this reproduction sample on Visual Studio 2013 and it did not exhibit the same problem. This compiler issue seems to be related to the compiler used in VS2010, and might or might not have the same problem in VS2012 we do not have access to it for testing purposes. Furthermore, we have tested that using a regular codeforcode loop does not crash. The question therefore is, strongwhy does the VS2010 compiler crashstrong What is it doing that confuses it so muchp  pYes, this is mostly a question for interestssake to learn about the compilerp

Negative 2473 pSomething happened to our dev branch such that a lot of code from the release branch got merged into it. Im trying to track down where these changes occurred but I get some very puzzling results. When I run codegit diff HEAD2code it shows a list of changes including many files that havent been touched in months, implying that codeHEAD2code is the commit that brought in the bad code as I see it. However if I run codegit show HEAD2code it shows a rather innocuous  commit that only touches two files. Further, when I run codegit reset hard HEAD2code it seems to fix the issues and to top off all the weirdness after I tried that reset twice and then undid it with codegit reset hard origindevcode it now appears that the commit with all the extra code is at codeHEAD1code.p  pI cant seem to make head or tails of this so any suggestionspointerstips or tricks would be welcome but some directed questions that are puzzling me are how can this code have gotten into the branch if there wasnt a merge commit If someone cherrypicked a commit from a production branch to the dev branch could that be related to this What are the differences if any in how codegit showcode and codegit diffcode resolve commitsp  pThe current theory I have given limited git knowledge it seems that these changes werent part of any commit but somehow got into the tree right around codeHEAD2code so codediffcode shows the changes as it walks the object tree but codeshowcode doesnt see them as theyre not part of a commit. Does this make any sense or am I way off basep  pEither way, thanks for any help you can givep

Negative 2473 pCan anyone explain what this function doesp  precodestatic inline void roundtozerovolatile float f    f  1e18   f  1e18  codepre  pI mean apart from add 1e18 and subtract it again, I understand that. But I dont understand what effect it will have on a float passed to it. The reason I am trying to understand it is that I am using doubles in some code that uses this function which I have converted from floats. Its audio code, and the above function comes from this libraryp  pa hrefhttpsgithub.comswhlv2blobmasterincludeladspautil.hhttpsgithub.comswhlv2blobmasterincludeladspautil.hap  pI am wondering if it will work on a double as is, or needs to be modified for the extra precision a double has. I suspect this knocks off the last few bits of data, erasing them from the float if they are there, although I dont quite understand how. But I imagine if this is what it does, I will need to change the exponent to suit a double. p  pTIA, Petep

Negative 2473 pI have an application where NLTK needs to interpret speech delivered by humans, and find meaningful chunks from it. The sentence which needs to be interpreted is of the form codefrom ltsomewheregt, to ltsomewheregt on ltsomedategt, ltclassoftravel,like ACCHAIRCARgtcode. As you understand, this can be expressed in myriads of ways, for example,p  ol lipI want to go to New York from Atlanta, business class, 25th July 2014.pli lipI want to travel via business class, to Atlanta on 25th July from New York.pli lipI have a dream that I will one day board a plane, travel in business class, descend at New York, the source being at Atlanta, preferably on 25th July.pli lip25th July Atlanta to New York, business class.pli ol  pYou get the idea. What I want to extract are few tidbits of information  source, destination, class, date. Some may be missing, which have to be identified, or appropriately assumed. Like if the source is found missing, identify that. Or if the year is missing, chalk it up to the current year. And all the while ignore the useless information like the strongI have a dreamstrong part, much as I adore Martin Luther.p  pIs there any way I can achieve this in NLTK I am aware that there are taggers available, and there are ways to train taggers, but I dont have sufficient knowledge on that. Is it possible to cover more or less all possible cases that can mean such a sentence, and extract the information like this If so, a little guidance would be appreciated.p

Negative 2473 pLets say I have couple of modules that handle authentication, One for each authentication provider Google, Facebook, Email etc.p  pI also have a router that uses these modules to authenticate users request.p  pLets say now that one of the users tries to authenticate and one of the auth module sees that the token is expired. I create an error inside that module with an internal message emtoken expiredem or something like that, then pass it back to the calling router module. The router wants to send back a client readable message like emYour session has expired, please try to log out and in againem.p  pSo the problem is strongwhere to translate the error messages from their internal representation to their client readable versions.strongp  pThere are two options the way I see itp  ol liDo it inside each of the auth modules since they know best what was the problem. Downside  breaks the module abstraction, the module now has to deal with clients messages.li liDo it in the router. Downside  need to create error codes  names and use an error handler with long list of emcaseem arguments to map each internal error to the client error. Might need to handle specific auth module errors as well, for example in email authentication the activation link in the email can be expired and the action needed is different then Facebook expired token.li ol  pWhat are some best practices to solve this problem, are there any Node  Express modules that help in some way p  pMany thanksp

This needs double redirecting. is it possible to do it with iptables I mean by using table nat chain OUTPUT.p  pBecause as far as I know table nat chain OUTPUT cant be called twice.p  pweb traffic  browser listening on 127.0.0.16666 p  pthese are my rulesp  blockquote   piptables t nat A OUTPUT p tcp j REDIRECT toports 6666p      piptables t nat A OUTPUT p tcp m owner uidowner bob m tcp j   REDIRECT toports 9040p      piptables t nat A OUTPUT p udp m owner uidowner bob m udp   dport 53 j REDIRECT toports 53p      piptables t filter A OUTPUT p tcp dport 6666 j ACCEPTp      piptables t filter A OUTPUT p tcp m owner uidowner bob m tcp   dport 9040 j ACCEPTp      piptables t filter A OUTPUT p udp m owner uidowner bob m udp   dport 53 j ACCEPTp      piptables t filter A OUTPUT m owner uidowner bob j DROPp blockquote  pthe above rules make stunnel work independently from TORVPN. i mean when browser is set with proxy, no traffic will go through TORVPN but if i turn off the proxy in browser, all traffic will go through TORVPN.p  pnow i want to let browser have the proxy on and all web traffic go to stunnel first, but outgoing stunnel trafficoutgoing loopback traffic redirects to TORVPN127.0.0.19040p  pis it possible  how can i do that somehow i mean double redirecting inside system.p  pPolicy of all tables is ACCEPTp

It will then perform operations on temp1 and temp2. However, when I run this as a check Im aware that Im not clearing temp1 and temp2 at any point, temp1 just fills with the full list of days and temp2 is empty.

Negative 2473 pI have three codeNcodebit numbers, codeAcode, codeBcode, and codeCcode.  I cannot easily calculate codeA  B  Ccode but I can easily calculate codeA  Ccode and codeB  Ccode.  If the modulo operation is unsigned and I know ahead of time that codeA  Bcode does not wrap around codeNcode bits then I can instead calculate codeA  C  B  C  Ccode.  However, is it possible to do anything for the cases where the modulo operation is signed or the addition of codeAcode and codeBcode might lead to a wraparound.p  pIt looks like there might be some confusion as to why codeA  C  B  C  Ccode cannot be relied upon to always work.

Negative 2473 pI am relatively new to ms query and still have problems with writing more complex statements. Heres a description of my problem p  pI compare  two columns that contain product number [prod1],[prod2] which in ideal world would be equal. In case theyre different or ONEBOTH are missing my Excel VBA highlights this issue on my spreadsheet. Right now I am just downloading a massive table into excel which can take more than 1 hour to refresh and that I would like to avoid as much as possible. The reason my table is so big is because most of the records are correct[prod1][prod2] and Id like to exclude them from my download list directly in ms query. p  pAnd here is my big problem if I try and exclude [prod1][prod2] it will exclude all the records, including those where both fields are blank which need to be downloaded, as I think that is being understood as equal. Ive tried to create a few IIF statements that include IsNull but apparently my syntax is ALWAYS wrong SQL0104 Token Not Valid. As I said, I am pretty new to the whole thing and I seem to make just too many stupid mistakes, because Im not that familiar with dos and donts in writing statements in ms query. If anyone knows how to resolve this issue I will be more than grateful if you could help me out. P.S. I hope I was specific enough and my explanation makes sense, if not Im happy to answer any questions. Regards, Mp
Negative 2473 pFirst question posted, whoop  pHello, Im implementing the CardView and RecyclerView libraries that are now included in the v7 android support library, but when the application runs, it quits when inflating the CardView layout.

Negative 2473 pokay, ive searched a solution for like two days now but i couldnt find whats going wrong with my code. p  pThe task is simple define a new type using typedef and have a function read out lines of this new type from a file into an array of again this new type. so my typedef inside the headerfile looks like this right now ive tried several variants of writing thisp  precode filename entries.h ifndef ENTRIESH define ENTRIESH includelttime.hgt  typedef struct     char Loginname[25]     timet RegDate     unsigned long Highscore     timet Hdate typePlayerEntry  int readPlayerListchar name, typePlayerEntry feld  endif  ENTRIESH  codepre  pthe main.cp  precodefilename main.c  include ltstdio.hgt include entries.h   int mainvoid      char name[13]numbers.txt     typePlayerEntry pep      readPlayerListname, pep      return 0  codepre  pmy function file looks like this and heres where the error is shownp  precodefilename readPlayerList.c  int readPlayerListchar name, typePlayerEntry feld  return 0  codepre  pirrelevant code is completely left out. The problem is reproducable with the code posted.p  pthe program wont compile because the type of the second argument in the function file could not be recognized,  which is odd, because its defined in the header file and also usable in the main function. And this error is somehow connected to the declaration of in this case a pointer of type playerEntry in my main.c. So if i do not declare it, theres no error, though i have to declare it to actually give it to the function. how come that the solution so far is to include the entries.h into the readPlayerList.c, which wasnt neccesary for previous functionsp  pim using eclipse kepler with MinGW, in case thats a compiler issue.p  pcorrected the missing include of time.h and adjusted the code a little.p

Negative 2473 pConsider that I have a Component class, and each Component could potentially have child Component. It is not a graph, but a tree, with single root. p  pConsider that I have a Provider or Factory for each Component. Also consider each Component Provider has colleciton of children Component Provider. Basically, the each concrete implementation of Component will have collection of child Component Providers, and will know how to build its children via Provider.p  pE.g. if I have Component A  B amp C, where B amp C are child of A, Component Provider of B amp C are injected to As implementation. This means that client who is consuming A if he requests B, A would know how to build B via Bs Provider. Other than building other child components, component has other responsibilities that makes it a Component.p  pDoes this violate single responsibility principles Is there a cleaner way to achieve such things What are the pros amp cons of such approachp  pFYI The programming language I use is Java, and above is currently being achieved via Guice 2.0. p

The change that I make is reflected on the page however so I suppose Angular still sees it.p  pHere is the relevant code from my controllerp  precodetrService.getProposalByIdroute.current.params.Id     .thenfunction query          scope.proposal  query.results[0]         trService.getTrByIdscope.proposal.TrID         .thenfunction query              scope.itinerary  query.results[0]                  .thenfunction query              Something irrelevant               codepre  pChecking the scope.proposal after this shows that its an Entity ctor.proto thing. Then my function for when im approvingsavingp  precodescope.onApproveConfirm  function            console.logBefore   scope.proposal.entityAspect.entityState.name         scope.proposal.IsApproved  2         console.logAfter   scope.proposal.entityAspect.entityState.name          trService.saveChangesscope.proposal, undefined, function result              console.logSaved   result.entities.length         , function               console.logSave failed               codepre  pOutput in the console looks like thisp  precodeBefore Unchanged After Modified Saved 0 codepre  pI use the saveChanges for all my other Entities without any problems. In the code between where I retrieve the proposal and where I change the IsApproved property I never access it. So can anyone see from this what goes wrong If you need any additional info im happy to supply it.p  pAlso if I put the save code directly after retrieving the proposal it does save.p

Negative 2473 pAccording to the laws of conditional probability, the statementp  precodeS1 ampamp S2 codepre  pwill never be true if S1 is false. However, in angular, this is not alaways true.p  pIn my HTML I have this Angular expressionp  precodengiffile.nodes codepre  pfile is an object that sometimes has the node property, and if it does, then it is an array. The Angular expression file.nodes evaluates to false if the array exists but it is empty this is already problematic as JS evaluates empty arrays as true for if statements. Howeverp  precodengiffile.nodes ampamp file.nodes.length  0  true codepre  pWILL be evaluated to true even if the array is empty. In this situation, Angular seems to not only be inconsistent with JS, but also with itself or the laws of conditional probability.

Negative 2473 pI have faced a problem I would like to compute the intersection of three circles. To the best of my knowledge, I should use the so called a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiTrilateration relnofollowTrilaterationa. I have implemented it in c. The a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiTrilateration relnofollowarticlea says that there are three limitation of this solution.p  ol liall three centers are in the plane z  0, li lithe sphere center, P1, is at the origin,li liand the sphere center, P2, is on the xaxisli ol  pAs for the first criterion, I have nothing to do because all the three centers are in the plane z  0 since I do not use Z coordinates. After that I translated the points to the positions where the center of the first point P1 is at the origin. After that, I rotated the P2 and P3 as well point to the position where the P2 is on the xaxis.p  pMy problem is When all the three center are on the X axis, I tried to compute the center of the intersection areawhich is computed by using the algorithm of the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiTrilateration relnofollowwikis articlea, but the calculation can not be done. On the other hand there is no limitation which says something like the centers of the circles can not be on one line... Lets see my problem visually, I just painted itp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comn7Ykh.png altintersection of three circlesp  pAs you can see, the three circle intersect each other on the same point at coordinates of 4,3. Therefore there is a solution for these points which are all on the same line in this example, on the x axis. The parameters of the circles are the following x,y,radiusp  precodeP1 0,0,5 P2 4,0,3 P3 8,0,5 codepre  pAs I mentioned, I successfully implemented the algorithm of the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiTrilateration relnofollowTrilaterationa but it can not solve this example, the result is NaN Not a Number.

Negative 2473 pI have a requirement that a face will be selected from gallery and put over an imageview which has only the body without face. Now if I tap on the face, the pixel colour of that area needs to become the colour of the body too. Basically image rendering is required, i guess. The problem is, I cant use imageview tintcolour because that changes the colour of the whole body, without showing the shades. The shades like 6 packs abs or elbow need to be prominent. So i need an effect like grayscale which will render the image, but not exactly grayscale. The colour needs to be the colour of the portion of the face I tap on. I am getting the RGB pixels from face, I need to render the body image to that colour. Any help will be appreciated.p

Negative 2473 pI am experiencing seemingly random errors in a 32bit python 2,7,10 using the latest pillow release 2.8.2 on win7p  pMy setup is the following I have a main window that shows an image in a canvas loaded via p  precodeimgImage.open...  self.imgImageTk.PhotoImage.img codepre  pHowever, I also have an overview window that displays a scaled down version of the same image, basically using the same approach starting with the current filename. As long as the images arent well beyond 10k x 5k pixels, I do not seem to encounter problems. However, once I get beyond that limit, I get IOStream Errors and out of memory errors. Using the 64bit version has, as expected, not yet produced the same errors as more memory can be used by python.p  pIf you are interested in seeing the actual piece of software, its freely available at a hrefhttpssourceforge.netprojectsitagbiology relnofollowhttpssourceforge.netprojectsitagbiologyap  pNo, this is not a post to generate downloads. You will see that the small size image loads very slowly. If you load up huge images larger than 10k x 5k depending on your pc, it will sometimes crash.p  pIm sort of lost here, since I cannot think of anything to catch errors, since an out of memory error can occur at any time I have caught the ioerror by replacing the preview image with a blank image, however, the main image must be guaranteed to load.p  pAny help is appreciated.p

Negative 2473 pUsing codeboostchronosteadyclockcode or codestdchronosteadyclockcode is suppose to guarantee that physical time is always monotonic and is not affected by date time changes in the system. Here is my question, if I have two processes that need to be immune to system date time changes, is it enough to exchange just the codetimesinceepochcode In other words, the time interpretation of the two processes to the same time since epoch will be the same Specifically I need to answer this question for Windows and QNX.p  pEDIT Both processes are running in the same computer, same operating system and communicate via IPC calls.p

Negative 2473 pI have a program that takes a size input from the user that is used to create a 2D array. All elements in the array is initialized to 0 except for element 0,0, which is the starting position of the token. Using a loop, a random number generator is used to randomly obtain a number from 18 that dictates how the token will move along the array 4 standard directions  4 diagonals directions in one step increments. When the token jumps to the next element on the array, that element get incremented up and a total jump counter is incremented. The loop ends when the token has visited all elements on the array, or when the array has all nonzero elements.p  pMy issue is that some randomly generated numbers can cause the token to jump out of the array and some of these illegal moves are counted on counter. Sometimes the random number would cause a jump that doesnt make any sense, like having a jump that changes position of 1,0 to 3,2. Sometimes it increments the wrong element having 4 should increment the one left of it instead of one the diagonal. I checked the code and for the most part it should work properly.

My problem is, that the json files have stored default state settings that I need to overwrite in cases a user cycles through data sets  otherwise he needs to select the stream config every change again.p  pExample Lets say we have the chart running with stacked and grouped available and some streams stream1, stream2, stream3. By default the chart loads stacked view and all 3 streams are visible in json file for e.g. 2015. p  precodechart.stacked true chart.state.disabled disabled[false,false,false] codepre  pSo if a user only wants only to compare stream 1 and 3 in different time series, he deactivatesklicks on stream 2p  precodechart.stacked true chart.state.disabled disabled[false,true,false] codepre  pand after that this setting is stored this is working and needs to be restored for the next data set different json file e.g. 2014 this is not working right now. p  hr  pWhat i have is a working chart, that is loading and displaying different json files. The selection is implemented by dropdown list and events are fired by jquery. I am able to save the states by getting values ofp  precodechart.stacked chart.state.disabled chart.reduceXTicks codepre  pWhen I overwrite the saved states i can see the new values in codechart.state.disabledcode but after an codechart.updatecode they are gone and i see the default states from the json file from the initial chart object.p  pI already played around with different functions like the dispatch functions changeState, stateChange but I had no success to keep the values in after a chart update.p  precodeoldStates is a copy of the last states before switching to a new time set json file in the chart. chart.state.disabled  oldStates   works but chart.update overwrites it with default values  chart.defaultStateoldStates  NO changes. marked as DEPRECATED in documentation saying Use chart.dispatch.changeState... instead.  chart.dispatch.changeStateoldStates   No change, not working codepre  pI would be glad in getting any hintstipps how to change states by overwritingchanging single states and update the chart with them, rendering only the new selection.

Negative 2473 pIm trying to find a pattern or a good example that works for the following scenariop  ul liA client asks for something from the server. Lets say clientserver COMs are implemented via some messaging system like EMSli liClients call is blocked until data comes back from the serverli liClients call returns data back to UI threadli ul  pLooks simple, however, I want it to be done in one go, without callbacks. e.g. service.GetNewOrderIDsorderType  ORDERTYPE.TECHNOLOGY will return a list of new order IDs. Another thing to keep in mind  service should support multiple requests and the order on responses from the server is not guaranteed. A call to GetNewOrderIDs is asynchronous, e.g. it is called from a Task. p  pMy own implementation is done using AutoResetEvents. I block the calling thread, store all requests and when a message comes back I resume a thread by calling .Set I link requests and responses with a GUID. p  pThis works fine but I have a feeling that it could be implemented better. AutoResetEvent is a bit low level. Maybe there are more modern ways of doing the same thing. Like using Blockingcollection or something similar. All suggestions are appreciated p

What I would like is to split the columns of each data array according to their corresponding latlon and put each data column into the correct 0.5x0.5suposup grid cell over the Beaufort Sea. Then Id divide number of clouds by total number of counts at each location and average to find cloud fraction within each grid cell, but I can figure that out after everything is properly gridded.   p  pSo if a grid cell were bounded by 68.7568.73suposupN and 118.01118.03suposupW, for example, then data columns 48 would end up in that grid cell because their latlon fall within the grid boundary.p  pAny help or hints would be greatly appreciatedp  pThanks, Aaronp

Negative 2473 pHow can I make a codeUITableViewCellcode stick to the bottom of the codeUITableViewcode it belongs to no matter whatp  pThe row can no longer be moved or edited because I configured codecanMoveRowAtIndexPathcode and codecanEditRowAtIndexPathcode to do so but the rows above it can still be moved below it. I want the last row to always be the last.p  pThe array that acts as a datasource contains instances of a custom class I made. However I would like the content of the last cell to be a codeNSStringcode. For example codeLast row...code.p  pSo I want fixed content I achieved this by removing the edit option for the row and fixed position always last no matter what.p  pI would like to know if there is a way of achieving this without a table footer.p  pIs it possible Howp  pThank you.p

In the URL of that page, a parameter coderedirecturihttp3A2F2F192.0.2.03A100812Fcode is visible.

Negative 2473 pId like to inquire on the origins of the difference in host verification behavior Im observing with Spring Web Services, 2.2.2.RELEASE under Spring Boot 1.3.0.M4 on Java 1.7.p  pWhen configuring the WebServiceTemplate to use HttpComponentsMessageSender I end up with the error reading as follows p  precodeIO error Certificate for ltuswebservice.uat.hroffice.comgt doesnt match any of the subject alternative names [.sbcsystems.com, sbcsystems.com] nested exception is javax.net.ssl.SSLException Certificate for ltuswebservice.uat.hroffice.comgt doesnt match any of the subject alternative names [.sbcsystems.com, sbcsystems.com] codepre  pWhen I reconfigure WebServiceTemplate to use emHttpsUrlConnectionMessageSenderem instead, the above error disappears and the call to verify the host name as per a hrefhttptools.ietf.orghtmlrfc2818section3.1 relnofollowRFC 2818a doesnt seem to occur vs. how it does in the above case or at least Im unable to trace it although I could see that Springs emHttpUrlConnectionMessageSenderems connection emsun.net.www.protocol.https.DelegateHttpsURLConnectionstronghttps uswebservice.uat.hroffice.comIWSUATcustomSstrong...em is assigned a respective host name verifier in its emcreateConnectionem method  emjavax.net.ssl.HttpsURLConnectionDefaultHostnameVerifierem.  p  pWhether the host name verification occurs or doesnt occur here in the successful case Im inclined to think that it still does, but would appreciate a hand in discovering stronghow its been invokedstrong what Im questioning is where the emHttpComponentsMessageSenderem the erroneous case obtains the certificate that makes verification fail.  I checked emcacertsem file that comes with Java installation emjdk1.7.076jrelibsecurityem  its not there.  The certificate present at the secure url above contains the correct Subject Alt Namep  precodeNot Critical DNS Name .uat.hroffice.com DNS Name uat.hroffice.com codepre  pwhereas in the case that produces the error, the certificate seems to have the following values for the Subject Alt Name field which makes it fail trying to dereference the URI above as per the spec  p  precode[8] ObjectId 2.5.29.17 Criticalityfalse SubjectAlternativeName [   DNSName .sbcsystems.com   DNSName sbcsystems.com ] codepre  pThe mysterious certificate in question is also visible in SoapUI which is how Im able to obtain in however running the test in that tool doesnt produce an error  Im assuming the host name verification is being somehow bypassed there perhaps someone knows the details.  p  pThe certificates are two distinct ones as they have different expiration dates.p  pI also tried to disable host name verification via providing a noop implementation of emHostnameVerifierem but that seems to be a questionable approach to security so in a quest to abandon it Im stumbled by the questions described above.  p  pI appreciate in advance if someone could shed a bit more light at the symptoms Im experiencing.p  pHere are the related Spring configurations p  precodeBean public KeyStore keyStore throws Throwable      KeyStoreFactoryBean keyStoreFactory  new KeyStoreFactoryBean     keyStoreFactory.setPasswordkeyStorePassword     keyStoreFactory.setLocationnew ClassPathResourcekeyStoreName     keyStoreFactory.setTypejks     keyStoreFactory.afterPropertiesSet     return keyStoreFactory.getObject   Bean  public KeyManager[] keyManagers throws Throwable     KeyManagersFactoryBean keyManagerFactory  new KeyManagersFactoryBean     keyManagerFactory.setKeyStorekeyStore     keyManagerFactory.setPasswordkeyStorePassword     keyManagerFactory.afterPropertiesSet     return keyManagerFactory.getObject   Bean public HttpsUrlConnectionMessageSender httpsUrlSender throws Throwable      HttpsUrlConnectionMessageSender sender  new HttpsUrlConnectionMessageSender     sender.setSslProtocolTLS     sender.setKeyManagerskeyManagers      sender.setHostnameVerifiernew HostnameVerifier           Override         public boolean verifyString arg0, SSLSession arg1              return true              return sender      Bean public WebServiceTemplate webServiceTemplate throws Throwable      WebServiceTemplate webServiceTemplate  new WebServiceTemplate     webServiceTemplate.setMarshallermarshaller     webServiceTemplate.setUnmarshallermarshaller     webServiceTemplate.setDefaultUridefaultUri     webServiceTemplate.setMessageFactorymessageFactory     webServiceTemplate.setMessageSendernew HttpComponentsMessageSenderhttpsUrlSender     return webServiceTemplate  codepre  pWhen analyzing the site at ssllabs.com its reported to only work in browsers with SNI support, perhaps the fact that its used from Java too has some effect on the above behavior however Java 1.7 seem to have added the correct SNI behavior by defaultp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comssXYU.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comssXYU.png altenter image description hereap
