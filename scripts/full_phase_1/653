Positive 653 pSo, I know a lot of questions have been asked around here about manifests but I havent quite found what I was looking for in terms of explanation. Basically I need a manifest for the installer of a Delphi application. Now most guides I see on manifests say to create a .manifest file and a .rc file then add .R file.res file.rc in the application so that it sees it when it starts and to place the files alongside the .exe.p  pNow where Im confused is that my manifest is for an installer, I cant place the files alongside the installer, logically, as it is its job to put the files where they need to go. Now Im not going to send a package with an installer and 2 other random files to people obviously. So Im just trying to figure out how the manifest can work for an installer. Thanksp

Positive 653 pI have a setup project created with visual studio installer. I have set some custom actions that will start my custommade WPF installer after the files are copied for further installation. But I have 2 problemsp  ol lipEven if I have disabled all windows, theres still a little loading bar from the msi that stays behind my WPF process that Im starting from a custom action not that big of a deal, I can live with that. The UI level is 3, and the one from silent install is 2 which is minimum. I was wondering if theres a way to set the default UI level to 2 silent no matter what, even when the user double clicks the msipli lipThis is the biggest problem The custom action starts my WPF process and waits for exit. If the user cancels the installation presses the X button in the WPF, the WPF will exit with a certain exitcode that I catch in my custom action. Now, i need a way to perform a rollback from my custom action in this case. The only way i have found is to throw an exception. But the user will then see the ugly dialog window from the msi with the exception, and I definitely dont want that. Can I force the rollback somehow without throwing the exception Or at least hide the msis UIpli ol  pNote the custom action Im using is the codeCommittedcode event, because i need all the files to be copied including some assemblies in GAC for my WPF to work.p  pI have found a couple of answers on stackoverflow, but none of them were helpful.

Negative 653 pIm currently using the awesome attachmentfu plugin for a Rails app, but as a novice developer, Ive never encountered a scenario like the one Ive found myself in.

My question is what the best use practice would be in these situations to remain strongemDRYemstrong, clear, and consistent.

Negative 653 pIve created a copy utility in c .NET 2.0 Framework that copies files, directories and recursive sub directories etc. The program has a GUI that shows the current file being copied, the current file number sequence, the total number of files to be copied and the percentage completed for the copy operations. There is also a progress bar, that is based on current file  total files.p  pMy problem is related to copying large files. Ive been unable to find a way to indicate the total copy progress of a large file using my current class structure that utilitzes FileInfo.CopyTo method. As a workaround Ive separated the file copy operations and GUI display to their own threads and set up a visual cue to show that work is being done. At least the user is aware that the program isnt frozen and is still copying files. p  pIt would be nicer to be able to show the progress based on the total number of bytes or have some type of event that fires from the FileInfo.CopyTo method that indicates the total number of bytes copied from the current file.p  pIm aware of the FileInfo.Length property, so Im sure there is a way MacGuyver my own event that is based on this and have a handler on the GUI side of things reading the updates maybe based on checking the FileInfo.Length property of the destination object using some type of timer.p  pDoes anyone know of a way to do this that Im overlooking. If I can avoid it, Id rather not rewrite my class to copy bytes through a stream and track it that way though Im thinking I might be stuck with going that route.p  pThanks In Advancep  pPS  Im stuck with the .NET 2.0 framework for now, so any solution that requires features available in  3.0 only are not an option for me.p  pPPS  Im open to solutions in any .NET language variety, not only c.p

Need to break binary compatibility  Its not done lightly but still not a big deal just add a new folder with the new version number.  Subversion knows where each version is so bug fixes can still be deployed to code duplicated in each version.  There would likely also be some discussion first to make sure its really necessary and so we can batch several changes into one new set, but the need to do this at all has been pretty rare to this point.p  pTo support this, we have a few custom project templates that automatically include references for the common libraries, and again we really like this setup.p  pNow finally for the meat of the question mdash much of what we do is supporting a large number of small legacy classic ASP pages.  These, along with new development, are slowly moving to .Net as well.  We really want to be able to use the emsameem support framework for these web apps that our other applications use.  Conventional wisdom says that an ASP.Net app cannot reference assemblies outside of the GAC or its own little virtual directory.  Thus to use our common code in our ASP.Net pages the best we could do is to install it to the GAC on the web server and every developer machine, and make sure every update to this code is propagated to those locations as well.  We find that distasteful.p  pGiven that we can give the ASPNet account the required permissions to read from the network share where the common code lives, and that well be building some custom project templates for these apps anyway so would could automatically include some settings in the web.config or subclass the normal asp.net page class as our starting point, for example does anyone know of any unconventional wisdom that says we might be able to reference these assemblies from their current location after allp

Negative 653 pIm currently writing python bindings for a c library Im working on. The library reads some binary file format and reading speed is very important. While optimizing the library for speed, I noticed that stdvector used in the instances Im reading was eating up a lot of processing time, so I replaced those with simple arrays allocated with new[] whether this was a goodwise thing to do is another question probably.p  pNow Im stuck with the problem of how to give python access to these arrays.

Negative 653 pI have a solution with two projects. One for project for the production code and another project for the unit tests. I did this as per the suggestions I got here from SO.p  pI noticed that in the Debug Folder that it includes the production code in executable form. I used NUnit to run the tests after removing the executable and they all fail trying to find the executable. So it definitely is trying to find it. I then did a quick read to find out which is better, a DLL or an executable. It seems that an DLL is much faster as they share memory space where communication between executables is slower. p  pUnforunately our production code needs to be an exectuable. So the unit tests will be slightly slower. I am not too worried about that. But the project does rely on code written in another library which is also in executable format at the moment. p  pShould the projects that expose some sort of SDK rather be compiled to an DLL and then the projects that use the SDK be compiled to executablep

Negative 653 pstrongSolvedstrong I figured out a clean way to do it with codesetjmpcodecodelongjmpcode, requiring only a minimal wrapper likep  precodeint jumpjmpbuf j, int i  longjmpj, i return 0  codepre  pThis allows codejumpcode to be used in conditional expressions. So now the codep  precodeif A  0 return output ltlt Nonzero.n codepre  pIs correctly translated top  precodereturn A  0 ampamp jumpcaller, 1, output ltlt Nonzero.n, 0 codepre  pWhere codecallercode is a codejmpbufcode back to the point of invocation in the calling function. Clean, simple, and efficient to a degree that is far less implementationdefined than exceptions. Thank you for your helpp  hr  pIs there a way to emulate the use of flowcontrol constructs in the middle of an expression Is it possible, in a commadelimited expression codex, ycode, for codeycode to cause a codereturncodep  pstrongEditstrong Im working on a compiler for something rather emsimilarem to a functional language, and the target language is C. Everything is an expression in the source language, and the sanest, simplest translation to the destination language leaves as many things expressions as possible. Basically, semicolons in the target language become C commas. Inlanguage flowcontrol constructs have presented no problems thus far its only codereturncode. I just need a way to prematurely exit a commadelimited expression, and Id prefer not to use exceptions unless someone can show me that they dont have excessive overhead in this situation.p  pThe problem of course is that most flowcontrol constructs are not legal expressions in C. The only solution Ive found so far is something like thisp  precodetry       return     x,                         x     1  throw Return0  0   return 0   catch Returnamp ret       return ref.value   codepre  pThe codereturncode statement is always there in the event that a codeReturncode construct is not reached, and as such the codethrowcode has to be wrapped in codecode to get the compiler to shut up about its codevoidcode result being used in an expression.p  pI would really like to avoid using exceptions for flow control, unless in this case it can be shown that no particular overhead is incurred does throwing an exception cause unwinding or anything here This code needs to run with reasonable efficiency. I just need a functionlevel equivalent of codeexitcode.p

Negative 653 pIm playing around with an ideanever played with TypeDescriptors before, and managed to get it to work nicely. But Im concerned about some best practice decisions I made during my little experiment.p  pI use a CustomTypeDescriptor, that receives an event from its PropertyDescriptors indicating that the values are changing or being queried.p  pThe TypeDescriptorProvider generates a completely new instance of CustomTypeDescriptor every time GetTypeDescriptor is called, it then binds the events on the CustomTypeDescriptor to the instance object. p  pIm unsure whether or not generating a new CustomTypeDescriptor each time GetTypeDescriptor is called would be a good ideaeven though I had to, to get this to work. Im also unsure if there are any consequences with binding events directly from the CustomTypeDescriptor to the instance object, especially if the CustomTypeDescriptor is dynamic.p  pWhat do you guys think Sample code of my Provider belowp  precodeClass EntityTypeDescriptionProvider     Inherits TypeDescriptionProvider  Public Sub NewByVal parent As TypeDescriptionProvider     MyBase.Newparent End Sub Protected Sub New  End Sub  Public Overrides Function GetTypeDescriptorByVal objectType As Type, ByVal instance As Object As ICustomTypeDescriptor     Dim CustomTypeDescriptor As EntityTypeDescriptor      Grabbin the base descriptor.

If instance Is Nothing Then         Return Descriptor     End If      If the instance doesnt implement the interface I use for Descriptor customization     which should never happen return the default descriptor for the type.     If Not Functions.IsImplementedinstance.GetType, GetTypeICustomTypeDescriptorEntity Then         Return Descriptor     End If                some lengthy customization based on the state of the instance.

Negative 653 pI currently have a website written in classic asp that runs multiple queries against sql, agregates the querues and than pushes them out for display on a web browser. Paging is not allowed The issue is that the web server agregates all the query results before displaying which takes up a lot of memory for even one query. The easy fix for classic asp is to write to the response object from a stream.p  pFor some reason I an unable to picture the equivalent in .net without requiring a service on the page of some type. I normally bind to listviews etc which is why I am probably stuck. So if I have a datareader from sql how can I stream that object out to the browser to have a small memory footprint Do I have to manually call the response object and write out That seems a little backwards. I think Im just missing something easy.p  pThanks.p  pAdd onp  pSo what I am looking for is how to progressively stream data from a sql reader to the html page so as not to waste memory. Is that even possible in .netp

Negative 653 pI am trying to build a simple application for WP7 from scratch.

Since I need to make different calls to the server that respond with different json objects, I am maintaining different .cs files for each, independant of mainpage.cs where i only initialize, define MainPageLoaded and MainListBoxSelectionChanged. All the data is fetched and processed in the individual .cs files.  Now the problem is that when I make the httpwebrequest and the reponse is retrieved, the UI is loaded well before that. As I understand from other posts the BeginGetResponse becomes a background process and the UI is loaded to keep it reponsive. So to summarize before the web request is returned with the data from the server, the UI is loaded as blank since the data is not populated. Now I cannot use the Dispatcher to populate since I am not in MainPage.cs and so cant access the List Box directly. I tried callback also but with no success.

When I click on the Align Right link, the text briefly aligns right, but then, I follow the link to the current page, which resets the alignment back to the left. p  pI found a way to sort of fix that problem, by using codelta href ...code instead of codelta href ...code. While this doesnt reload the page so the text stays aligned, it does take me to the top, which isnt really what I want. Id like a solution similar to the codereturn falsecode that works with the inline javascript. Is there a simple way to do this Or am I doing it wrong completely p

Negative 653 pWhat are some of the betterbest ways of implementing a countdown timer in iOSp  pIve done some digging and tried using NSTimers 1 sec timer but some people suggest thats not a good way because its not very accurate  Others claim it wastes battery, since its always going to be on in the background till the time elapses.  I was thinking I could create a multiple scheduled NSTimer so it wont loose sync.  Some suggest I should record the actual timestamp at the beginning and somehow make use of the builtin clock and use that to update the timer countdown.... except I cant seem to figure out how to do that.  Any ideas  How are you implementing itp

Negative 653 pIm building a adminwebinterface for a legacy webapplication. This interface is to be used by superusers for administrating backend stuff that I usually do manually in the db. This can be things like prioritizing report generation The app generates reports which take 1015 minutes each, sometimes we need one report before all the other ones in the queue, user management and such.p  pWhat I was thinking was making the M in the MVC a bit abstract. In the DB, a report is a bit abstract. But in my head, the Report entity can lend itself well to MVC terminology if I help it work. A report could easily have CRUDactions, just with a bit of tailoring to fit into the db.p  pIs this a bad way to use MVC Is there a problem with the M being the Domain Model of sorts instead of an actual DB Modelp  pAnd yes, Im new to MVC . And all this is in ASP.NET MVC 3, with a SS2k8 sql backendp

Negative 653 pIm trying to secure my AJAX calls by appending a session token to be matched by a browser cookie by the server as a parameter to every single AJAX request made from my web app.p  pId like to avoid having to specify the token as an additional parameter in every single codeAjax.Updatercode request, as that could get onerous very quickly. So I thought it might be more effective to have this token appended to every request globally, automatically. p  pIm wondering whether codeAjax.Respondercode could handle this. It seems as though it should be able to intercept any Ajax request before its made, and modify the parameters to add the token before its sent out. But, I have no idea how Id go about accomplishing it. Would I need to prototype Ajax.Responder, and burn in an additional parameter Or is there an easier wayp  pMy understanding of codeAjax.Respondercode is a little weak, so if somebody could clarify why this would or wouldnt be possible in their answer, it would be greatly appreciated.p
Negative 653 pI have a Data Access Layer in my application which wraps an ADO.NET data provider. The DAL converts the data returned by the data provider into .NET objects. Ive seen a lot of posts advising against unit testing the DAL, but it worries me that so much could go wrong in there  theres lots of looping and casting and null checks.p  pI had some thoughts about creating a mock DbProvider with something like RhinoMocks, but the number of interfaces Id have to mock out in each test would be overwhelming, and the number of expectations Id have to set would make the tests very hard to read. It seems that each test would be more complex than the code it was testing  which would be a disaster from the perspective of the 3 goals of unit testingp  ol liReadabilityli liMaintainabilityli liTrustworthinessli ol  pI had an idea to implement a friendly DbProviderFactory to load the sample data from xml. I could plug it in via Dependency Injection in the tests. It should make maintaining the tests much simpler. A trivial example might bep  precode[TestCase] public void CanGetCustomer      var expectedCommand  new XmlCommandspgetcustomer     expectedCommand.ExpectExecuteDataReader         resultSet ltcustomer firstNameJoe lastNameBlogs ... gt      var factory  new XmlProviderFactoryexpectedCommand      var dal  new CustomerDalfactory     Customer customer  dal.GetCustomer      Assert.IsNotNullcustomer, The customer should never be null     Assert.AreEqual         Joe, customer.FirstName,          The customer had an unexpected FirstName.  codepre  pI think this approach  using a friendly DbProvider  might make it easier to test the DAL code. It would have the following advantagesp  ol liThe test data would be in xml, and could be placed in source control along with the unit tests. It could be in external files, or inline in the tests.li liIm not using a real database so this eliminates the statefulness problem. So I dont have to put a database into a known state prior to each test.li liI dont have to mock out all of the ADO.NET interfaces in each test. Ill code one set of fake implementations which I can reuse all over the codebase.li ol  pCould people provide some critique on this idea Is there already a similar implementation that I could use for thisp  pThanksp
Negative 653 pIve been writing a program that forks many times and each of the forks may also fork into smaller parts.p  pEach of the lowest level children is ultimately running a complex calculation and outputting the results in, what I am hoping, is a uniquely named file.p  pThe IDs need to be unique such that when all the children are finished, the parent can reap the children and then collect the data.p  pAs an example to help make this more concrete, each of the children will produce a file codeuniqueid.storablecode containing the data that the respective child has processed.p  pWhen the parent finds that all the children are finished, it uses storable to read back in the files into a hash and use the, hopefully unique, codeuniqueidcode as the key.p  pThe problem presents itself when two children are spawned nearly simultaneously. Right now, each of these children ends up running its own independent counter so that multiple children may all create a similarly named codeuniqueidcode, even though the data in those files are indeed unique.p  pHow can I share a counter variable, a mere scalar, between forksp  pI realize that questions of interprocess communication are rather common on the interwebs but I notice many solutions address a general problem of sharing arbitrary amounts of data between processes. I merely need to share a single scalar so I wonder if my problem can be handled in a simpler fashion. Ideally, quite ideally really, I would prefer a solution that does not involve a nonstandard module. I see that codeIPCShareablecode is sometimes recommended but I wonder if that may be overkill for my problem, and this is one of those nonstandard modules, anyway.p  pWould it be wise if I make my codeuniqueidcode the PID Is it possible that the parent program running over a course of say, one week, on a heavily used machine, might reuse PIDs and not guarantee uniquenessp  pId appreciate any advice people can lend.p

Negative 653 pIm currently working on transitioning a small console application to a TCP server  client application. The client will connect to the server via any Telnet client, and the server will replicate the standard console interface for each Telnet connection.p  pI started looking into doing this using the techniques Ive learned from Beejs guide to network programming  accepting the connection and then using fork to separate it into its own process.p  pHowever, I would prefer to maintain my use of streaming IO the original console application uses cin  cout, using similar functions for the networking logic would make the conversion process much simpler.p  pIve discovered the TCPStream class, hiding within sockets.h httpwww.gnutelephony.orgdoxybayonne2a00215.htmlp  pIt appears this class will allow me to use the server with streaming IO.

Thus, in any round, there are more or less only relative few items to repriorizate. So Im hoping that there could exist a datastructure that would be able to exploit this pattern and therefore outperforming the cost of doing mandatory codeheapify.code in every round in order to satisfy the heap invariant.  p  pstrongUpdate 2strongbr So far it seems that the codeheapify.code approach is quite efficient relatively speaking indeed. All the alternatives I have been able to figure out, needs to utilize codeheappush.code and it seems to be more expensive what I originally anticipated. Anyway, if the state of issue remains like this, Im forced to find a better solution out of the codepythoncode realm.p

Negative 653 pI am adding resources lots of .pngs and other to my iPhone project dragging the folder to it and choosing Create Folder references for any added Folder, to retain the folder structure. They are correctly added to the Copy Resources build phase.p  pProblem is, I am wasting A LOT of time because when I createdeleteupdate a new resource, it will often ignore changed files and stick with the older version.p  pLooks like it tries to only updates resources when they are changed, but it fails to see the changes. In the simulator it was possible to manually update the files in the .app, but when working on the device it will complain that the code sign of some resources has changedp  pThe only reliable way Ive found to force it to update everything is deleting the build products, the app and the device app emsome timesem, until it finally decides to forget about the old version, but doing this for each resource change is wasting me an insane amount of time game content changes more than often.p  pSo, in short how do I force XCode to disable versioning and to just scrap all the resources and copy them all each timep  pThanksp  pEDIT I have found that deleting the .app folder built in build folder always forces XCode to add new files...p  pI still have no clue on where it keeps the old files when I delete that folder, but this is for the better as it only copies new resources as intended. So a simple script like p  precoderm rf CODESIGNINGFOLDERPATH codepre  pDoes the trick of deleting the folder at each build...p  pUnfortunately, XCode apparently runs the codesigning BEFORE anything in the Build Phases tab is executed, so it updates the old target, the script deletes the old target, and then it crashes complaining that no Code Signing Resources were found.p  pSo... I have to stick with manually deleting the file, or is there a way to run a script before code signingp

Negative 653 pFor a personal project Im working on right now I want to make a line graph of game prices on Steam, Impulse, EA Origins, and several other sites over time. At the moment Ive modified a script used by SteamCalculator.com to record the current price sale price if applicable for every game in every country code possible or each of these sites. I also have a column for the date in which the price was stored. My current tables look something like sop  precodeTHIS STRUCTURE IS NO LONGER VALID.

Ill likely be doing this eventually, anyway, for performance reasons.p  pNow my issue is determining how to best update this table if one of the prices changes. For instance, lets suppose that on 8222011 the game code112233code goes on sale in America for 4.99, Austria for 3.99, and the other prices remain the same.

I have only found that you can ignore or update if a unique index is the same.

Negative 653 pIs there anyway to just have the GUID be part of the SQL Query itself without using a parameterp  pLet me explain exactly what I am trying to do and why. I am working with an existing application that uses an ADO.Net to create and connect to a SQLite database.  The current structure of the database and the method for querying it are horrendous.  I am in the midst of a redesign of how it works fundementally.  However, that is not something that can be accomplished quickly.  While that redesign is being completed I have a situation that needs a bandaid solution. As a heads up, the reasoning behind the initial implementation of the code is obscure and appears to have been built by someone who had little database knowlege.  Refactoring the entire database to not need this situation is the ultimate solution, but for now Im just looking to work within the existing structure.p  pThe design of the database relies on GUIDs to uniquely identify rows.  To perform filtered retrieval of the data the system dynamically builds a command that has an IN clause listing the GUIDs that should be retrieved.  Right now the GUIDs are inserted into the query by using a paramter with type GUID, so the query will look like p  precodeSELECT  FROM datatable WHERE guidcol IN , , ,  codepre  pThe problem comes in when I need to retrieve a relatively large amount of information.  SQLite has a limitation of a 1000 paramters in a single query.  If I need to pass in more than a 1000 GUIDs for the retrieval the query will just break.  When building the above string it loops over a list of GUIDs to insert the question marks and create the paramters.  My bandaid fix to the problem was going to be to have the GUID value directly inserted into where the question marks are currently and forego having parameters in the query.  After all, its kind of using parameters for a purpose they dont need to be used for.  p  pThe problem  with this solution is that I cant seem to get the GUID to match the data in the column i.e. the query is always returning null.  I understand that GUIDs are not a native type to SQLite and underneath it is actually being represented as a BLOB yes I am sure we are using the BLOB and not the string representation. Yet, Ive been unable to get the query to execute correctly. p  pIve tried all the following so farp  pIve tried calling ToString on the GUID so the query looks likep  precodeSELECT  FROM datatable WHERE guidcol IN     b5080d4e37c342869c3a413e8c367f36, aa0ff7893ce9455298405ed4d73c1e2c codepre  pIve tried calling ToStringN on the GUID so the query looks likep  precodeSELECT  FROM datatable WHERE guidcol IN    b5080d4e37c342869c3a413e8c367f36, aa0ff7893ce9455298405ed4d73c1e2c codepre  pIve tried calling ToStringB on the GUID so the query looks likep  precodeSELECT  FROM datatable WHERE guidcol IN    b5080d4e37c342869c3a413e8c367f36,     aa0ff7893ce9455298405ed4d73c1e2c codepre  pIve tried calling ToByteArray on the GUID and putting the result into the query by adding each byte to the string calling ToStringX on each byte so the query looks likep  pSELECT  FROM datatable WHERE guidcol IN      4ED8B5C33786429C3A413E8C367F36, 89F7FAAE93C524598405ED4D73C1E2Cp  pIn reading the SQLite documentation I read the following BLOB literals are string literals containing hexadecimal data and preceded by a single x or X character.

Negative 653 pIm having a JTextField problem.  I am needing to get text from a JTextField and modify it later in a JDialog.  I am using the same variable for the JTextField.  As long as you dont enter the dialog, the string printed is whatever you entered in the text field.  If you enter a string in the dialog, it will only print that string until you change it again in the dialog renders the primary text field useless.  I can fix this by adding a separate variable, but would like to try to avoid unnecessary declarations.

Negative 653 pIm going to using openFrameworks to develop a music visualizermusic drive graphics. I can use Opengl to do the graphics. But the problem is the audio processing part. I have no experience in this field. I once thought I could extract music featuressuch as pitch, beat, volume to control the graphics. But I now I dont know how to start. I learned fft in math, but I dont know what to do after I get the spectrum of a piece of music, how can I extract those music features after fft Or how to do the music processing partp
Negative 653 pI recently changed our asp.net gridviews which worked with update panels to HTML tables, using jqueryAjax and templating using jtemplates. The performance improvement was huge on the server side I am using a generic httphandler. One performance problem I am dealing with occurs on Firefox, because of the jtemplate plugin. Somehow it takes F.F to render a 20 rows template up to 3 seconds on I.E or chrome it takes about 100ms. Which is the preferred templating plugin, when my goal is mainly simplicity and performance I am trying jsrender, which is fast, but not documented enoughI had some problems doing things inside a for loop. Knockoutjs seems great but is pretty sofisticated and I am afraid of performance problems as well. Thanksp

Negative 653 pIm trying to create a bot script for a third party chat service using PHP. The clientserver communication is based on socket.io, but works best with websockets  and, in fact, is quite easy to replicate without socket.io in browsers that support websockets.

Negative 653 pIm attempting to automate something at work that requires minimal background process. Normally Id use C, but this is problematic, as part of what Im automating is a test process that scans the system looking for running processes. Command windows are fine, but most anything beyond that gets to be problematic. As part of kicking off this series of tests, I am trying to find a way to get a batch file to read one line at a time from a .csv file. Each line contains 4 values separated by commas, of course which should be put into variables. The first var will be the test number. When starting the batch file, Ill be providing a test number as an arg, and want it to compare the test number received to the test number it read from the file. If it matches, continue testing. If not, move on to the next line and read that data into the variables. Everything else is really simple, but I cant figure out how to get it to read and parse a .csv file one line at a time in the manner described. Any help would be appreciated. p  pJust for information, I am well aware of how to do this in C, and I know there are many other solutions that would be better easier than batch files.  However, there are specific reasons why employing those solutions is a poor idea in our situation, so were trying to go old school with the batch files.p

We are using the FTDI Vinculum II VNC2 for the USB host controller, and my boss would like a solution where the customer can plug in any or most bluetooth USB dongles into the USB port on our instrument and then be able to connect our instrument via bluetooth to an android phone.p  pIve found out the USB dongle only implements the Controller Stack HCLSCO, LMP, and HCI and that the Host my custom firmware in this case must provide the implementation of the Host Stack, or the parts of it that we need in any case HCI, L2CAP, RFCOMM at least.p  pMy question is, is there any way around having to implement the host stack from scratch Are there any reasonably priced dongles that are hostless eg. they implement both the host and controller portions of the bluetooth stack and communicate with a simple protocol that we could just provide along with our instrument I know of the RovingNetworks FirePlug which does this and we have one and have gotten it to work but it is 70 and very large. I am looking for a similar solution that is not so costly and also smaller profile so that it doesnt stick so far out of our handheld instrument... either that or another solution that I am not aware of that would allow our customers to plug any USB bluetooth dongle into our instrument and be able to connect to their android phone without us having to implement the bluetooth host stack on our end...p  pThanks in advance for any information.p

Negative 653 pI am trying to figure out the best solution to a rather complicated problem.  I need to be able to publish data from a database as a webpage dashboard.  I am not allowed to query the database directly except through a program called Xtraction.  However, Xtraction has the ability to export queried data to MS Excel.p  pI am wondering anyone can tell me whether the C API for Excel will allow me to grab the data in Excel and use Excels native charting functionality to produce the rich charts I need to post on the webpage.  Right now, the only way I know to explore this is by getting MS Visual Studio 2010 and I dont want to put out the money if its not going to be able to do this for me.p  pAny advice is appreciated.p  pRegards.p

Negative 653 pwe are developing an iOS App using Adobe FlexAir. The app uses a web service that needs user authentication via facebook login. At the moment, we use server side authentication Theres a login URL displayed in a WebView where the facebook login is done. This way, we get an accesstoken that can be used on the server side.p  pThis works perfectly but it would really be much better if we could use Single Signon with the facebook ios app. As far as I have read, this should work on the client side but I havent found a way to authenticate the user on the server side. p  pfacebooks accesstokens are valid either for use on the serverside or for the client side so an accesstoken from the clientside login wont work for the server side.p  pThanks in advance for your ideas,p  pHenkp

Negative 653 pIm working on a couple of iOS apps that require the user to select a calendar date, and while the builtin date picker widget is all right, Id much prefer if users could choose days from a calendar grid, similar to how it works in Hipmunks iOS app. In that app, users are shown an infinite scroll view showing a grid of days, with each cell showing the month and day. The days of the week are shown in a persistent i.e. nonscrolling banner.p  pIn addition to simply showing a calendar, this control should allow dates to be highlightedselected. Better still, users should be able to select a whole range of dates by tapping on the start and end days cells, at which the whole range of days should be highlighted.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 653 pI have come to believe that the optimal size for a boolean variable is the natural width of the data, ie in CC it is int. So for modern processors this is normally 32 bits. At the machine level declaring it as a byte for example requires a 32 bit fetch and then a mask.p  pHowever I have seen that a BOOL in iOS is 8 bits. I had assumed that people who used bytes were using leftover ideas from 8 bit processors.p  pI realise this question depends on the use and for most of the time the language defined boolean is the best bet, but there are times when you need to define your own, such as when you are converting code arriving from an external source or you want to write cross platform code.p  pIt is also significant that if a boolean value is going to be packed into a serial stream, for sending over a serial line such as ethernet or storing it may be optimal to pack the boolean in fewer bits. But I feel that it is likely that it is optimal to pack and unpack from a processor optimal size.p  pSo my question is am I correct in thinking that the optimal size for a boolean on a 32bit processor is 32 bits and if so why does iOS use 8 bits.p

Specifically, that project knows that its propertyfiles lives in a subfolder named after the project.p  pstrongWhystrongp  pTo remove duplication of the propertyfile in each project that needs to dump copyright and version information we have put the property file in its own project.p  pWe could not find any other way to look up the correct propertyfile, than to put it in a uniquely named folder for each project.p  pWe build applications reusing lots of these projects, which means we need to find this information in many different jar files, so the namepath of the propertyfile needs to be unique.p  pstrongProblemsstrongp  pThe Eclipse m2eplugin does not like the dependencyunpack and the buildhelpermavenplugintimestampproperty goals.p  pWhen checking out a project as a maven project using the m2eplugin, it marks the pomfiles inheriting from our parent.pom as having errors.p  ul liWe moved the execution of the two goals to the package phase, which should be m2e noninteresting phase, but still gets errors see a hrefhttpsdocs.sonatype.orgdisplayM2ECLIPSEProjectbuildlifecyclemapping relnofollowhttpsdocs.sonatype.orgdisplayM2ECLIPSEProjectbuildlifecyclemappinga.li liWe have added the lifecyclemapping plugin with configuration to ignore the timestampproperty goal, but it annoyingly still gives an error at checkout, which then disappears after the checkout.li liWe have also added configuration to ignore the unpack goal.li ul  pWith all three changes, it seems to work. Unfortunately, when running the projects from Eclipse, we no longer have the propertyfile...p  pstrongIssuestrongp  pAll this was done to remove duplication and to avoid the need to commit a filechange for each release,.p  pAnnoyingly, our solution still require that we know which projects an application consist of to read the information from each jar and present in an Aboutbox.p  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pHow would you suggest adding common information to multiple projects that is used in an application, and be able to look it up for each of the jar filesp  pAnd, can it be done with maven in a m2efriendly wayp  pLooking forward to suggestions,br Henrikp

Negative 653 pI am trying to create a custom view, which is similar to NSScrollView, but is based on CoreAnimation CAScrollLayerCATiledLayer. Basically, my app requires a lot of near realtime CGPath drawing, and animates these paths using shape layers its similar to the way GarageBand animates while recording. The first prototype I created used NSScrollView, but I could not get more than 20 frames per second with it The reason was that NSRulerView updates by drawing every time the scrollEvent happens, and the entire call flow from [NSClipView scrollToPoint] to [NSScrollView reflectScrolledClipView] is extremely expensive and inefficient.p  pIve created a custom view that uses CAScrollLayer as scrolling mechanism and CATiledLayer as the traditional documentView for infinite scrolling option, and now I can get close to 60fps.

For a test shader I have thisp  precode   attribute vec4 position    attribute vec4 color     varying vec4 colorVarying     uniform vec2 translate    uniform float rotate    uniform float scale    uniform vec4 camera  x, y, z  angle, w  zoom     void main              const float w  3.2         const float h  4.8          mat4 projection  mat41.0w, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0,                        0.0, 1.0h, 0.0, 0.0,                        0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0,                        0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0          float s1  scale  sinrotate         float s2  scale  cosrotate          mat4 m  mat4s2, s1, 0.0, 0.0,               s1, s2, 0.0, 0.0,               0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0,               translate.x, translate.y, 0.0, 1.0          glPosition  projection  m  position          colorVarying  color    codepre  pWhich works just like its supposed to for every degree of freedom. However, I cannot figure out how to incorporate the camera. The order of multiplication of the matrices in the shader does not match the order of the gl calls, so Im not sure how to convert my camera calls into multiplication. At first I was also trying to calculate a seperate tranformation matrix for the camera, and set the final position like thisp  precode    glPosition  projection  cam  m  position codepre  pWhich I dont think is right regardless of the order for the camera matrix itself I tried multiple ways, none worked right. I believe all the camera and object modelview transforms must be compiled into a single modelview matrix each matrix multiplied by the last, starting with camera tranforms, then object, but obviously in a specific order. This order of operations is what Im confused about, espcially since it doesnt match up with what was working properly in ES1.1.p  pCould someone explain the proper order, and why the gl calls are different than the actual multiplicationp

Negative 653 pThis is a bit of a strange one, but I was wondering if anyone might have seen it before and know of a cure.p  pBasically, we have updated a schema and the format has radically changed.  The schema was used in a number of maps, so these have also been updated.p  pWhen testing one of the maps Visual Studio right click, test map it claims that the test suceeds, but the resultant xml is in the old schema format and not the new updated format.p  pThe mapper shows the correct schema, I have tried rebuilding and even redeploying just in case something was holding on to the old schema somehow, but it still maps to the old format.p  pAny suggestions welcome.p  pCheers Stu.p

Negative 653 pI have a data set that contains around 60,000 records.

Negative 653 pWe are developing an windows 8 store device app using C which will communicate to the device using Win32 API and IOCTL calls in a C dll.

Negative 653 pI am developing in Java using Spring for my company. We are developing an application that we have a local LDAP server. The LDAP server will be used to fetch information. However, we do not want the user of the application to know the LDAP structureschema. This is because the customeruser will have their own LDAP server with their own LDAP structureschema.p  pFor example, the customeruser will fetch information through a user interface by providing the LDAP server details that will be used to conect to the LDAP server. Once connected, they will be able to fetch information by executing a query. Now, they will not know information about the LDAP structure. The code that will be written, will be done by executing the user query. If the query is run, then it will return that information, otherwise it will give an Exception.p  pThe problem that I am facing is thatp  pWhen you use Spring LDAP, there is something called AttributesMapper and ContextMapper. In order to use this, I have to pass in a strongly typed object. So for examplep  precodepublic class EmployeeAttributesMapper implements AttributesMapper   public EmployeeAttributesMapper        This method maps the Employee Entity to data stored in the LDAP Server through a Attribute.   param attrs the name of the Attribute to get   return the Employee Entity.   public Object mapFromAttributesAttributes attrs throws NamingException      Employee employee  new Employee     employee.setFirstNameString attrs.getcn.get     return employee   codepre  pThe above code when executed depending on the query, will fetch information only about the cn attribute and nothing else. Is there something else that doesnt require an strongly typed objectp  pI am not sure what to do.p  pFor example, to search for all employeesp  precodepublic List getAllEmployees      return ldapTemplate.search, objectclassperson, new EmployeeContextMapper  codepre  pThis will return all the employees but only set the cn attributes. But, on the customer LDAP server they may not have the attribute called cn.p  pWhat is the best way to do this Our code that we write, acts as a proxy between the user interface and the customer LDAP server.p

Negative 653 pI have a C Windows Forms Application, developed using Microsoft.Net Framework v2.0 but using VS2010. p  pIve recently developed a CCLI assembly which references some C libraries I would like to integrate into this application. Although the CCLI application was developed using VS2010, it has been set to compile using the Microsoft.Net Framework v2.0 and compiled by installing VC Express 2008.p  pAfter referencing my CCLI assembly in my C Windows Form Application and attempting a build, Im now getting the below errorp  precodeThe specified module could not be found. Exception from HRESULT 0x8007007E Line 218, position 5 codepre  pLine 218, position 5 of the above mentioned .resx file takes me to an ImageStream representation of images in Base64 format for an ImageList object on the form. If I remove this ImageList object, the application compiles without problems. It seems incredibly odd that my CCLI assembly would cause this to break.p  pIve tried using Dependency Walker to identify any missing DLLs required by the Windows Form executable, or the CCLI assembly, but am still getting this exception when building even when replacing any DLLs it states are missing.p  pIve also tried using Process Monitor to see which files it might be looking for when building, but is very difficult to interpret the results.p  pCan anybody recommend any next steps I could take trying to resolve this Right now Im all out of ideasp  pThanks in advance for any assistance providedp  pedit  Its actually the ResGen.exe part of the build which is failing when referencing the CCLI DLL.

Negative 653 pGood morning.p  pIm developing a small media player with built in support for audio recognition using the a hrefhttpdeveloper.echonest.com relnofollowEchonest APIa. Ive dealt with APIs before and know how to submit and parse results, but the other APIs provided simple codePOSTGETcode examples in their documentation thus opening it up to almost every situation regardless of language or platform.p  pThe Echonest API however, only provides CURL examples. CURL is something Ive never dealt with. Im working in codeDelphi XE3code, or codeFiremonkey 2code to be specific, and thus theres no built in CURL library or components. There are a few thirdparty ones available, but Im not confident theyre up to date as theyre listing Delphi 6 as being their development environment, and brief searches indicate theyre no longer working with modern versions of Delphi whether this is true or not is a different story.p  pAs Im wanting to try and keep things as crossplatform as possible to potentially compile an codeOS Xcode version at a future date, and feel confident in dealing with codePOSTcode and codeGETcode already, how would I go about translating this CURL command into something I could use with codeIndycode for examplep  precodecurl F apikeyFILDTEOIK2HBORODV F filetypemp3 F trackaudio.mp3 httpdeveloper.echonest.comapiv4trackupload codepre  pThis was taken directly from their a hrefhttpdeveloper.echonest.comdocsv4track.htmlupload relnofollowAPI documentationa, and is used for uploading a track to their service.p  pIm not sure on the specifics regarding CURL and so before I go throwing random data at the service, I felt it best to see whether the SO community can give a brief explanation and example that I can work from. The explanation is much more valuable than the example in any case, but an example may serve well for anyone else who happens to stumble upon a similar problem.p  pRegards, Scott Pritchard.p

Negative 653 pI hear frequently that accessing a shared memory segment between processes has no performance penalty compared to accessing process memory between threads. In other words, a multithreaded application will not be faster than a set of processes using shared memory excluding locking or other synchronization issues.p  pBut I have my doubtsp  p1 shmat maps the local process virtual memory to the shared segment. This translation has to be performed for each shared memory address and can represent a significant cost. In a multithreaded application there is no extra translation required all VM addresses are converted to physical addresses, just like in a regular process that does not access shared memory.p  p2 The shared memory segment must be maintained emsomehowem by the kernel. For example, when all processes attached to the shm are taken down, the shm segment is still up and can be eventually reaccessed by newly started processes. There could be some overhead related to kernel operations on the shm segment.p  pIs a multiprocess shared memory system as fast as a multithreaded applicationp

Negative 653 pAt my company we have a scale that checks the weights of boxes before loading them into a truck. In the case the box contains more or less product than acceptable, the box is rejected and delivered to another conveyor belt. The electronic scale keeps a record of the performance of the operation.

Negative 653 pI am trying InApp Purchase for the first time. Im creating an app where every purchase increases an item count with a specific limit. For every click of buy button the counter increases by 50 items for 0.99. I have successfully implemented the InApp transaction with product IDs in sandbox mode. The issue is that after successfull transaction it says your InApp download is available, and if I try again it says you have already purchased this item, download it. But my scenerio is different, I want to make every transaction at every click with items increased. I have nothing to download, Im just increasing the limit of available products.

Negative 653 pAlright I am going crazy here. I have enqued jquery scripts and they are working properly tested everything. I took a look at the page source and did couple of alerts and console logs to make sure the script.js is getting loaded inside wordpress page. I need to use addClass with jQuery to add a class called dropdown to list items inside the menu. I have checked my spelling and tested with console, no errors are found but the class is not there. That happens even if I target general all LI elements on the page, not just specific ones. I can change all of the list items text using textsome text and any other property, but cant add class to list items. Can someone explain why this happens Is there any other way of adding class of dropdown to all list items inside of wordpress menu i am using function wpnavmenu  to add a custom menu made from WP backend It is crucial that top level list items parent lis have this class since I am developing a theme using Bootstrap and this is how Bootstrap works.

Negative 653 pIm trying to create a find method from scratch to see if two objects are equal given that the results of certain methods are equal, using the Equals method to do so. I know using the FindContains methods would be faster, but Im not allowed use them. The signature of the method is codestatic int FindList c, Coffee xcode Find seeks codexcode in codeccode and returns a valid index e.g., code0code, code1code if codexcode exists in codeccode, returns code1code otherwise. The equals method must be used to determine equivalency. If the passed object isnt equal to an object currently in the list, it is added to the list the list contains two types of objects that derive from a base class, so the list can store both types. Equivalency is defined by codenamecode, codecostcode, codedemandcode, codeholding costhcode and coderoasttypeMcode for regular and codenamecode, codecostcode, codedemandcode, codeholding costhcode and codeminimum quantityalso Mcode for codedecafcode.

Goldberg and Baumert, 2004. For a discussion, see Philibert 2005a. 169210.qxd  21105  1022  Page 187 BROADENING AND DEEPENING these targets, as a percentage of actual emissions, moderate required abatement fluctuations relative to that of fixed or GDPindexed targets. In practice, however, countries would demonstrate domestic reductions, proving that emissions would have been higher by the agreed percentage in the absence of the target. This would require constructing a baseline of emission trends in the absence of the countrys actions. As with the calculation of baselines and additionality under projectbased mechanisms, this demonstration may encounter technical and political difficulty. Worse, the uncertainty on the delivery of any surplus allowances will be resolved only after the commitment period. This makes this option probably less marketfriendly than others. Under a regime of allowances and endowments,162 each participating country would  Require domestic energy producers to hold an annual emission allowance for each tonne of carbon embodied in their energy production, sales or imports.  Issue perpetual emissions endowments of annual emission rights equal to a fraction of emissions during a base period.  Potentially provide additional annual allowances to firms within its borders at a stipulated price set at USD 2.7tCO2.  Create domestic markets for perpetual endowments and annual allowances. These would involve no international trade, but the common price for annual allowances would guarantee short run economic efficiency.  Designed for both developed and developing nations, this regime calculates endowments volume specific to each. Developed countries would receive emissions endowments based on their Kyoto targets. Developing countries would receive emissions endowments equal to their current emissions plus an agreed percentage. Therefore, in the 5 188 162. McKibbin and Wilcoxen, 2002. 169210.qxd  21105  1022  Page 188 short run, the price of annual allowances would be zero in developing countries. The allowance price will equalise over time, as developing countries ability to pay rises. The distinction between annual allowances and longterm endowments should set a long term price signal without excessive shortterm cost.  Longterm permits163 could be used to cover emissions at any time during a long commitment period, perhaps from 2010 to 2070. This extended period should allow agents to identify the most efficient timing of emission abatement. Authorised borrowing between successive shorter periods would provide the same time flexibility.  Box 11 on page 112 illustrates why time flexibility may not be detrimental to the environmental integrity of a greenhouse gas trading regime. Banking has proven an effective tool to smooth price variations and avoid risk of noncompliance. Its absence in the RECLAIM NOx trading programme exacerbated allowance price increases. Lower expected costs due to time flexibility may facilitate the adoption of more ambitious targets at the onset. International emissions trading under the Kyoto Protocol allows for limited time flexibility in two forms the fiveyear commitment period, to smooth yeartoyear climate or economic variability and the possibility to bank unused allowances.164 Complete time flexibility, however, would require both borrowing and banking to allow optimally timed investment in abatement. A mechanism familiar to controversy, borrowing presents the obvious risk that sources will indefinitely defer investment. As with longterm targets, this risk increases in the absence of strong enforcement mechanisms. This default is perhaps most likely in the international arena where regime participants are sovereign nations. In the end, the market may provide the same service as borrowing  a source buys allowances to meet its current deficit and sells its surplus future allowances under a forward contract. This leaves BROADENING AND DEEPENING 5 189 163. Peck and Teisberg, 2003. 164. Article 3.13 of the Kyoto Protocol. 169210.qxd  21105  1022  Page 189 BROADENING AND DEEPENING the compliance risk with the source, where it belongs, while borrowing transfers the consequences of noncompliance form the source to the environment or the government.  It is not certain that the above options would fare better than dynamic, nonbinding, and sectorwide targets to encourage participation of developing countries in international emissions trading.  Developing Economies Circumstances Institutional capabilities A global regime must engage developing nations. Beforehand, system architects should assess the institutional capacity of developing economies to participate in international emissions trading and the risks arising from insufficient capacity, were they to participate. We addressed in the above the risk on economic development and solutions to it. Other risks are likely to remain. If transparency, accurate monitoring, a functional legal system, and realistic incentives to trade are scarce in countries with economies in transition, the problems run much deeper in the developing world.165 In developing nations, one finds few people with the necessary skills and experience to implement and monitor sophisticated policies skilled labour is concentrated in cities rather than field posts monitoring equipment is in short supply even baseline data are unreliable and informal and even institutionalised corruption runs rampant. Greenspan Bell suggests that it may be impossible to expect that countries only beginning the process of environmental protection can start with the most difficult environmental instruments. As Baumert et al. 2003 also note, the success of trading systems requires competitive markets and other conditions that, in reality, may 5 190 165. Greenspan Bell, 2003. 169210.qxd  21105  1022  Page 190 prove elusive, especially within the confines of international treaty law where participation and compliance cannot be assured. Further, if crossborder financial flows from trading turn out to be significant, then it does not necessarily follow that revenues would be used domestically for socially beneficial purposes, such as poverty alleviation or helping countries adapt to adverse climate impacts.  There are no easy answers to such questions. The need for a working legal system to back emissions trading seems obvious. Countries or entities now holding valuable allowances could be tempted to sell without delivering corresponding reductions, unless strong enforcement measures are in place. On the other hand, the costeffectiveness of emissions trading would exert a lower pressure on the compliance regime of any environmental policy and lower the probability of non compliance by offering cheap compliance options. According to Willems and Baumert 2003, the form of future targets may dictate institutional needs of emissions trading Fixed, legally binding, comprehensive targets certainly put the strongest pressure on the domestic policy setting to create the institutional conditions to meet them. Dynamic targets or targets with price caps somewhat reduce these capacity needs by reducing a source of uncertainty inherent in achieving a fixed target. Yet, they have new features which may create additional institutional capacity requirements. Sectoral targets and non binding targets unequivocally reduce some of the institutional needs, by, respectively, reducing the scope of the target and limiting capacities needed to make sure the target is met. To participate efficiently in carbon markets and mitigate GHG emissions, economies in transition and developing countries must build institutional capacity in environmental policy. As energy statistics could be the basis on which countries define their trading opportunities and needs, energy authorities may have an important role to play. At the activity level, the capacity limitations suggest focusing on sectors with relatively sophisticated management such as the electricity generators and petroleum producersdistributors.

Negative 653 pThe code below works if you enter a city and state, then click outside of the text box but NOT  directly on the Search submit button.  Clicking outside of the text box triggers the onblur event which fires the javascript code to run a bing maps geocode on the city and state and populates the two hidden text boxes with the latitude and longitude.  THEN when you click the submit button the code passes the latitude and longitude into the CityDistanceSort action on the Job controller which sorts the cities in the database based on their distance from the  latitude and longitude passed in, then posts that sorted model to the view.  Everything works except that you need to be able to enter the City and State and then of course just click the Submit button directly.

Negative 653 pUPDATE I talked to the guy who wrote FixedHeader, and it seems that it isnt going to work for me.  I think the problem is that my table is inside of a tab, which is causing some problems see the screenshots in my other update, and he said that the current version of FixedHeader doesnt address these issues.  Ive tried some other plugins and methods for fixed table headers, and theyre all giving me similar problems.  I suspect its because my table is inside of a tab.  If anyone has any easy solutions, please let me know.  Otherwise, dont worry about it.  Ive got a lot of other stuff to work on for this website, and the fixed table header seems to be taking up too much time. p  pIm trying to use a hrefhttpdatatables.netextrasfixedheader relnofollowFixedHeadera for a hrefhttpwww.collegeanswerz.comcolleges relnofollowmy websitea.  p  pI downloaded a hrefhttpdatatables.netdownloadbuildFixedHeader.js relnofollowFixedHeader.jsa and put it in codevendorassetsjavascriptscode.

Negative 653 pSo I am quite new to WPF and thought that as a learning experience I would implement a simple level editor in WPF. The purpose of the editor is 2fold. First I want to be able to define arbitrary oriented bounding boxes as the solid area in the level. I then want to be able to place, resize, skew images.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comODzet.png altpolygon editor imagep  pI have implemented the ability to draw oriented bounding boxes using a Canvas See image above. The Canvas and a toolbar are within a dock panel. I am now planning to implement the image capabilities. What I thought to do is create another Canvas layer perhaps many for each layer of images. The reason for doing so is that I can easily restrict selection and visibility of each layer. However I am not sure how to properly layer multiple canvas controls. Certainly the DockPanel container I am currently using doesnt let me have multiple controls on top of one another. I thought to embed my Canvas layers within another canvas but I am no sure how to properly set this up note that the setup should be dynamic in code as I would like to allow users to add more layers as necessary. p  pThe ideal end result would be an arbitrary number of layers that have a transparent background so we can see the layers behind and which can be easily hidden. There would also only be 1 layer at a time receiving the user input.p  pSo my question is, is their a more appropriate approach rather than layering canvases If layering of canvases is a good method could someone provide linksexample code for how this can be setup. What is the optimal container for multiple stacked controls note the child canvas size should match the parent container.p  pCheersp

Negative 653 pI am working on an iOS app in Xcode. Earlier I got it to start and run, up to a limited level of functionality. Then there were compilation failures claiming untouched boilerplate generated code had syntax errors. Copying the source code into a new project gets a different problem.p  pRight now, I can compile and start running, but it states before even the launch image shows up that the application was closed due to memory pressure. The total visual assets is around 272M, which could be optimized some without hurting graphical richness, and is so far the only area of the program expected to be large. The assets may or may not be kept in memory for instance every current loading image is populated and my code never accesses any loading image programmatically. And it crashes before the loading image has itself loaded.p  pHow can I address this memory issue I may be able to slim down the way images are handled, but I suspect there is another root cause. Or is this excessive memory consumptionp  pThanks,p

Negative 653 pLets say I have three tables. One table TblArticles describes, for example, articles. It has an autoincrementing key, article name and other data about it, such asp  precodepkIndex  sName  Other Data...     1     Name1  Data1    2     Name2  Data2    3     Name3  Data3 codepre  pEt cetera.

And I have a relations table TblArticlesTagsRel for them, since one article can have multiple tags, and each tag can be applied to multiple articlesp  precodeindArticle  indTag       1        1      1        2      2        1      2        3      3        3 codepre  pEt cetera.p  pSo, my question is, what is the best way to select rows from TblArticles which fit certain conditions like sName being something specific AND having several specified tags for example, Politics AND Science applied to them Note that for this I need all specified tags to be present for every selected row, not either one of the specified tags.p  pI know I can do it by selecting which results of a previous select fit the conditions for another tag, but if I choose several tags, the select query becomes increasingly more and more complex because of this nesting and I do believe there has to be another, easier way.p  pIve tried using AND in various ways, but I can not figure out exactly how to use it in this case.p  pOh, and, if its important, Im using SQLite.p  pstrongEDITstrong So, while the answer from greyalien007 didnt work for me, it did point me in the right direction, and thats what I have used in the endp  precodeSELECT a.

Ive read through practically all of the ZF2 and Doctrine documentation, but still cant seem to figure out how to get this working.p  pTo briefly explain the system, there is a main entity called Policy. The Policy entity includes a Proposer entity and a PolicyProduct entity, as well as a couple of other columns.p  pI am using Class Table Inheritance in the PolicyProduct entity, as I have 3 different product types, each with different data required. The 3 product entities are TouringCaravan, StaticCaravan and Parkhome.p  pThe Policy entity can only have 1 Proposer and 1 PolicyProduct.p  pAll entities have getter and setter methods for each column.p  pThe form im displaying includes fields from both the Policy entity and the PolicyProduct entity. p  pTo display the form, i first get the Policy entity and Policy Fieldset. And then set the Policy Fieldset as the base.p  precodepolicyEntity  entityManagergtgetRepositoryPolicyEntityPolicygtfindpolicyId policyFieldset  formElementManagergtgetpolicyformpolicyfieldset policyFieldsetgtsetUseAsBaseFieldsettrue codepre  pI then get the PolicyProduct specific fieldset and add it to the policyFieldset.p  precodeeg productFieldset  formElementManagergtgettourersformtouringfieldset policyFieldsetgtaddproductFieldset codepre  pI then add the policyFieldset to the form, bind it with the Policy entity, and return the completed form.p  precodeproductFormgtaddpolicyFieldset productFormgtbindpolicyEntity return productForm codepre  pTo note, i am using the codeDoctrineModuleStdlibHydratorDoctrineObject as DoctrineHydratorcode as my hydrator for each fieldset. I then call the following inside the  codeinitcode method of each fieldset.p  precode Example from PolicyFieldset hydrator  new DoctrineHydratorthisgtobjectManager,true  thisgtsetHydratorhydrator      gtsetObjectnew Policy codepre  pIf i complete the form and save to the database, i can see that the data is stored correctly in the tables. If i then try to hydrate the same form with the entity, none of the PolicyProduct Entity values are mapped. The values in the Policy Entity are hydrated correctly though.p  pIf i dump out codepolicyEntitygtgetPolicyProductcode i can see all the data, which means that the entity is correctly saving and retrieving the information, the problem appears to be when i try to extract the entity data to the form fieldset.p  pI hope this makes sense, but let me know if not and ill try to clarify.p  pThanksp  hr  pHere are the main entitiesp  pPolicyp  precodenamespace PolicyEntity  use DoctrineORMMapping as ORM    ORMEntity  ORMTablenamepolicy  class Policy            ORMId      ORMColumntypeinteger      ORMGeneratedValuestrategyAUTO          protected id            ORMManyToOnetargetEntityProposerEntityProposer, inversedBypolicy      ORMJoinColumnnameproposerid, referencedColumnNameid          protected proposer            ORMManyToOnetargetEntityProduct      ORMJoinColumnnameproductid, referencedColumnNameid, onDeleteRESTRICT          protected product            ORMOneToOnetargetEntityPolicyEntityPolicyProduct      ORMJoinColumnnamepolicyproductid, referencedColumnNameid          protected policyProduct            ORMManyToOnetargetEntityPolicyStatus      ORMJoinColumnnamepolicystatusid, referencedColumnNameid, onDeleteRESTRICT          protected policyStatus            ORMColumnnamepolicyInception, typedate, nullabletrue          protected policyInception       Omitted getters and setters   codepre  pPolicyProductp  precodenamespace PolicyEntity  use DoctrineORMMapping as ORM    ORMEntity  ORMTablenamepolicyproduct  ORMInheritanceTypeJOINED  ORMDiscriminatorColumnnameproductDiscriminator, typeinteger  ORMDiscriminatorMap1  TourersEntityTouringCaravan, 2  StaticsEntityStaticCaravan, 3  ParkhomesEntityParkhome   class PolicyProduct             ORMId      ORMColumntypeinteger      ORMGeneratedValuestrategyAUTO          protected id       Omitted getters and setters  codepre  pTouringCaravan  example of a PolicyProduct Inherited Tablep  precodenamespace TourersEntity  use DoctrineORMMapping as ORM use PolicyEntityPolicyProduct    ORMEntity  ORMTablenametouringcaravan   class TouringCaravan extends PolicyProduct             ORMId      ORMColumntypeinteger      ORMGeneratedValuestrategyAUTO          protected id            ORMOneToOnetargetEntityPolicyEntityPolicy      ORMJoinColumnnamepolicyid, referencedColumnNameid          protected policy            ORMManyToOnetargetEntityTouringCaravanMake      ORMJoinColumnnametouringcaravanmake, referencedColumnNameid, onDeleteRESTRICT          protected caravanMake            ORMColumnnamecaravanModel, typestring, length128, uniquefalse, nullablefalse          protected caravanModel      ....

Negative 653 pI am completely stumped here.  I am creating a simple member system for class and I keep getting 23750 no matter what password variation I type in.  First I thought it was a db issue, so I manually entered one and it was fine.  Then, i echoed out the password to the next page and I am getting 23750 still.  I made the form again from scratch, and the number 23750 does not even remotely exist in any of my code.  Any thoughts  Here is the code, anyways.p  precodeltphp   Check if user is logged in first if SESSION[loggedin]   user is logged in     headerLocation members.php  pageTitle  Register

Negative 653 pSo I am building a web application that I want to sell once Im done with it. It allows the user to enter data such as their website name, meta keywords, their contact email, phone, address etc in the admin panel. I wrote a Action Filter in order to include these values in every request that I put the filter on so I didnt have to query for them every time because these values are included in the common footer throughout the site. However, I learned that if I update the database with new or different information for these values, it does not update on the web pages which im guessing is because Action Filters are configured at application start up. In the Action Filter I am using a repository pattern to query for these values. I have included the code for the action filter below. How can I have the convenience of the Action Filter but be able to update it dynamically when the data changes in the database Thanksp  precodepublic class ViewBagActionFilter  ActionFilterAttribute,IActionFilter      Repositories.SettingsRepository repo  new Repositories.SettingsRepository      void IActionFilter.OnActionExecutedActionExecutedContext filterContext              base.OnActionExecutedfilterContext           void IActionFilter.OnActionExecutingActionExecutingContext filterContext              string siteName  repo.GetSiteName         string siteDesc  repo.GetSiteDescription         string siteKeywords  repo.GetSiteKeywords         string googleAnalytics  repo.GetGoogleAnalytics         string streetAddress  repo.GetStreetAddress         string zipCode  repo.GetZipCode         string city  repo.GetCity         string state  repo.GetState         string aboutUs  repo.GetAboutUs         string phone  repo.GetPhoneNumber         string contactEmail  repo.GetContactEmail          if string.IsNullOrWhiteSpacesiteName ampamp siteName.Length gt 0                      string[] splitSiteName  new string[siteName.Length2]             splitSiteName  siteName.Split              if splitSiteName.Length gt 1                              filterContext.Controller.ViewBag.SiteName1  splitSiteName[0]                 filterContext.Controller.ViewBag.SiteName2  splitSiteName[1]                          else                              filterContext.Controller.ViewBag.SiteName1  splitSiteName[0]                 filterContext.Controller.ViewBag.SiteName2                                 Set default values for common viewbag items that are on every page using ternary syntax         filterContext.Controller.ViewBag.SiteDescription  string.IsNullOrWhiteSpacesiteDesc ampamp siteDesc.Length gt 0  siteDesc           filterContext.Controller.ViewBag.SiteKeywords  string.IsNullOrWhiteSpacesiteKeywords ampamp siteKeywords.Length gt 0  siteKeywords           filterContext.Controller.ViewBag.GoogleAnalytics  string.IsNullOrWhiteSpacegoogleAnalytics ampamp googleAnalytics.Length gt 0  googleAnalytics           filterContext.Controller.ViewBag.StreetAddress  string.IsNullOrWhiteSpacestreetAddress ampamp streetAddress.Length gt 0  streetAddress           filterContext.Controller.ViewBag.ZipCode  string.IsNullOrWhiteSpacezipCode ampamp zipCode.Length gt 0  zipCode           filterContext.Controller.ViewBag.City  string.IsNullOrWhiteSpacecity ampamp city.Length gt 0  city           filterContext.Controller.ViewBag.State  string.IsNullOrWhiteSpacestate ampamp state.Length gt 0  state           filterContext.Controller.ViewBag.AboutUs  string.IsNullOrWhiteSpaceaboutUs ampamp aboutUs.Length gt 0  aboutUs           filterContext.Controller.ViewBag.PhoneNumber  string.IsNullOrWhiteSpacephone ampamp phone.Length gt 0  phone           filterContext.Controller.ViewBag.ContactEmail  string.IsNullOrWhiteSpacecontactEmail ampamp contactEmail.Length gt 0  contactEmail           base.OnActionExecutingfilterContext          codepre

Negative 653 pCurrently were working on a solution where we want to track for analysis the articles a user clicks onopens and likes from a given list of articles. Subsequently, the user needs to be able to see and reclickopen the article searching is not needed in a section on hisher personal user profile. Somewhere around the 100 new articles are posted every day. The increasing amount of daily visitor users lies around the 2000 a day. The articles are currently stored and maintained within a MySQL Db.p  pWe could create a new record in the MySQL Db for every article read  liked. Worst case would this create 2500  100   250000 records a day. That wont hold long of course strongSo how would you store process this within XPages, given the scenariostrong p  pemMy thoughts after reading a hrefhttpwww.timtripcony.comblog.nsfd6plinksTTRY8NKTPN relnofollowthe article  about MIMEBeansa what about keeping read articleObjects in a scope and periodically storesave them as MIME on the user profile document This only creates 100 articleObjects a day or 36500 a year. In addition, one could come up with a mechanism where articleObjects are shifted from one field to another as time passes by, so the active scope would only contain the read articleObjects from last month or so.emp

Negative 653 pI wouldnt say I am new to android development been doing it for 6 months or to programming languages in general been doing ruby on rails and C for almost 1 year nor am I an expert or even experienced enough to do it full time as a job but I seem to be running into issues that I didnt have with C or Ruby on Rails. p  pEvery five seconds I seem to stumble into a difficult challenge that has been making progress very slow. For example, I have used the official android development website since I started but it seems more of an overview than tutorial. With almost every tutorial or guide provided there are steps needed to complete the application that do not feature in the guide themselves. The ActionBar Tab Menu tutorial shows how the tabbed menu works and also how to change it from text to icons... but at no point do they give you example code, or decent instructions to actually get a working example. shown belowp  precode  Override     public Fragment getItemint index           switch index          case 0             return new FirstFragment         case 1             return new SecondFragment         case 2             return new ThirdFragment                   return null      codepre  pIt took almost three days to figure out the solution after using google and every resource available on the android dev site stackoverflow actually provided the answer in the end to fine a few lines of code.p  pTwelve tutorialsguides whatever you want to call them Ive done now from the android dev site and every time I find portions of missing code or explanationsexamples that make it a painful process trying to learn more complicated actions you can perform.p  pIs it the way I am trying to learn Java and android I recently bought a ruby on rails book pragmatic programmers ecommerce and when I got the the final section creating orders for the imaginary admin to see it basically said... were going to skip over this section because the code isnt complicated enough to warrant space in the book.p  pIs this the general idea Not to be given copy paste code but rather that I must figure out a solution or find an example by myself, or is there a better way to go about learning android programming maybe another steady resource I can use instead ofas well as the android dev topicsp  pAny information or opinions especially from hobby devs or android devs who develop for a living would be very welcome.p

If it doesnt, the only solution I see is to split documents according to their language as different types and then fire several queries in parallel and have some sort of sink function on the client that would merge results and sort them by their score. But, even though I could send a bulk query to limit network roundtrips, that solution is clearly not optimal.p  pAny thoughtsp

Negative 653 pcould you please advise or give some hints how to do following. I have POJO lets say it is called BankHistoryData. I would like to copy data from two tables into this POJO main table  Bank and its archive  BankArchive. Tables have a lot of fields which are basiclly the same, so I would not like to repeat my self.br I googled around and found a tool that could help me with this  Java generic constructor. But, I am a little bit new with generics and not sure how exactly to do it.br I suppose I should have something like this  p  precodepublic class BankHistoryDataltT extends Serializablegt       I would like to set this fields from the object T     private field1     private field2      and many more ...      T a  source object from which to copy values     public BankHistoryDataT a          this.a  a         copyData             NOT SURE ABOUT THIS ... something like this     public void copyData        ifT instanceof Bank           this.field1  Banka.getSomeField          and so on ...        else if T instanceof BankArchive           this.field1  BankArchivea.getSomeField           and so on ...        else           trow new IllegalArgumentExceptionNot supported table              codepre  pAny suggestions are welcome. Thanksp  pmismasp  p[EDIT] I have decided not to use generic for this, as I think those 2 cents from Alex where for that. Instead I will do this copy logic in my business logic service layer POJO will remain stupid.br Although, I will make those two hibernate objects to implement common interface only getter methods of shared fields will be here. And finally, I will make a copy method on my business logic service layer and make it to take that interface parameter for copying fields.br Hope this will help someone. Also, any comments are welcome.br Cheersp

Negative 653 pIm having an issue while updating a datagridview of on WinForm.  I set the DataSource of the datagridview to a bindinglist like sop  precodeListltDatagt rows  new ListltDatagt  BindingListltDatagt list  new BindingListltDatagtrows  this.dataBindingSource.DataSource  list this.dataGridView3.DataSource  this.dataBindingSource codepre  pIn a different method within the class I am adding to the datagridview by adding to bindinglist like sop  precodeData theData  new Data  .... Data is an object with various getters and setters like theData.price  ... theData.qty  ... ....  this.BeginInvokeMethodInvokerdelegate  list.AddData  codepre  pThis works fine when I make single calls to the method that is updating the binding list. But I have a situation where I am calling the method multiple times back to back from a different method like sop  precodeupdateRowMethod.... updateRowMethod.... codepre  pThe two calls are providing different data for the update.  But now the datagridview inserts 2 new rows but both rows contain the same data and in both rows it displays only the data passed in the second method call.p  pThe method where rows are being added to the datagridview first updates a database with the data before adding it to the datagridview and on startup the datagridview is populated with data from the database.  Subsequently if I relaunch the application, the datagridview is populated with the correct data.  So the problem only occurs when viewing the new rows which are added while the application is currently running and being updated, the problem doesnt occur on restart and data is pulled from the DB.p  pI have put in breakpoints and see that the BeginInvoke line which adds the data is correctly being called twice for the 2 method calls and both times the correct data is coming into that line, and it is adding 2 new rows but it is only displaying data from the second function call.p  pI would greatly appreciate any insight you all may have.p  pThanks p

Negative 653 pI have a project that has a horizontal jquery image carousel. The site is responsive and the carousel needs to have the images get slightly smaller at a certain screen width. I have been able to accomplish this within the css, but the carousel plugin has some javascript settings that I need to change to complete the responsiveness. I have figured out how to work in a media query to get the javascript to change appropriately on page load, but it does not work on resize. Every time I try to include code to change the images on resize the code breaks. Can anybody please help me adapt this code to also work on resize...p  pHere is the carousel so you can see how it is workingor not Try resizing and refreshing the browser to see how it almost works.

So I thought I would just pass something like this   localhostpage.aspxminifyfalse on client side just to view how the unminified version looks like, if I need to debug something. But this does not seem to change anything. So does it mean that whatever settings I have at the start would be continued throughout the session or can they be changed.p

Negative 653 pIm writing a few mobile apps to help students at my college access resources on their mobile devices.  I have everything functioning after a user logs in, but I still cant figure out how to reengineer the login page.  Right now, the only way to log in is to open a codewebviewcode to the login page.

I just passed that value along with my login information in a codePOSTcode, and sure enough, I logged in.  Awesomep

The keyboard remains visible however.p  pWhats strange is that no logs are left either via the Terminal debug output area or the whole iPhone console log.p  pAdditionally  this ONLY happens when running it on an actual iPhone.

Negative 653 pSo, I am building an app that has the user input data such as a task manager would do. For example, the user will click on a button called Create new event and then my app leads them to a screen that has a bunch of questions such as Date Time and name of event. At the bottom of this screen is a done button. And when the user clicks this button, I need the app to save all the information that was entered by the user, and save it into a file with  the same name as the event. I need this file to be able to be accessed if needed and saved until the user decides to delete the event. So its almost like making a calendar app that allows someone to enter an event and keeps that event on the calendar. Even if the app closes, the event should be on the calendar when the user opens the app again. I know I most likely will be using sharedPreferences, bundles, and files, but I dont know how to have my code make a unique file name every time an event is made.  p

Negative 653 pIm using LWJGL to create sort of a Minecraft Clone.p  pThe problem is that i only get about 20 FPS. with about 32 blocks in each direction Also when i change the chunk the view freezes for some milliseconds.p  pIm loading the textures with Slick. To render the blocks I use VBOs for textures and vertices no VAOs or Shaders or normals. Each block consists of 6 quads which consist out of 2 triangles. Faces between blocks arent rendered. Every frame the rendering thread checks for all 32  32 chunks if they are loaded into a buffer and if they should be loaded depending on player position. If they are needed the vbos are created and the handles are saved to a list. If the chunks are too far away, the buffers get deleted. While rendering, all vbos currently in the graphics cards ram handles saved in list are drawn.p  pHow can i speed rendering up Should i have the buffers in loaded all the time and draw only the objects needed Can normals or VAOs or shaders help me get a drastic improvement Still if i get the frame rate higher there will be mor blocks than just a plate and im planning to import .obj.p  pMinecraft renders in i think DisplayLists. Would that be a solution Create a display list for every chunk or block and recompile them if block or chunk changesp  pEdit I measured with VisualVM that the most time consuming method is glDrawArrays.p  pSome source codep  pRenderingp  precodepublic static void render      glClearGLCOLORBUFFERBIT  GLDEPTHBUFFERBIT      forVBO vbo  vbos              disable texture smoothing         glTexParameteriGLTEXTURE2D, GLTEXTUREMAGFILTER, GLNEAREST          glBindTextureGLTEXTURE2D, vbo.texture         glBindBufferGLARRAYBUFFER, vbo.vertexhandle         glVertexPointervbo.vertexsize, GLFLOAT, 0, 0l         glBindBufferGLARRAYBUFFER, vbo.texturehandle         glTexCoordPointervbo.texturesize, GLFLOAT, 0, 0l          glEnableClientStateGLVERTEXARRAY         glEnableClientStateGLTEXTURECOORDARRAY          glDrawArraysGLTRIANGLES, 0, vbo.vertices          glDisableClientStateGLVERTEXARRAY         glDisableClientStateGLTEXTURECOORDARRAY          glBindBufferGLARRAYBUFFER, 0       codepre  pChunk loading detectionp  precodeint chunkX  intcamera.getX  1  GameData.CHUNKSIZE         int chunkZ  intcamera.getZ  1  GameData.CHUNKSIZE          forint cx  0cx lt GameData.NUMBEROFCHUNKScx                      forint cz  0cz lt GameData.NUMBEROFCHUNKScz                              boolean shouldBeLoaded  Math.abschunkX  cx lt 2 ampamp Math.abschunkZ  cz lt 2                  ifGameData.chunks[cx][cz]  shouldBeLoaded                                      ifshouldBeLoaded                         Util.loadChunkcx, czloads every block in the chunk                     else                         Util.unloadChunkcx, cz                                        codepre  pBlock loadingp  precodepublic void load      try         ifGameData.map[x][y1][z]  null  GameData.map[x][y1][z].id  2             top  Util.createQuadx, y1, z, 1, id     catchIndexOutOfBoundsException e      try         ifGameData.map[x][y1][z]  null  GameData.map[x][y1][z].id  2             bot  Util.createQuadx, y, z, 1, id     catchIndexOutOfBoundsException e      try         ifGameData.map[x1][y][z]  null  GameData.map[x1][y][z].id  2             left  Util.createQuadx, y, z, 0, id     catchIndexOutOfBoundsException e      try         ifGameData.map[x1][y][z]  null  GameData.map[x1][y][z].id  2             right  Util.createQuadx1, y, z, 0, id     catchIndexOutOfBoundsException e      try         ifGameData.map[x][y][z1]  null  GameData.map[x][y][z1].id  2             front  Util.createQuadx, y, z, 2, id     catchIndexOutOfBoundsException e      try         ifGameData.map[x][y][z1]  null  GameData.map[x][y][z1].id  2             back  Util.createQuadx, y, z1, 2, id     catchIndexOutOfBoundsException e  codepre  pUtil.createQuadp  precodepublic static VBO createQuadfloat x, float y, float z, int axis, int id      boolean xA  axis  0     boolean yA  axis  1senkrecht     boolean zA  axis  2      FloatBuffer vertexdata  BufferUtils.createFloatBuffer6  3     ifxA              vertexdata.putnew float[]  x, y, z,          vertexdata.putnew float[]  x, y, z1,          vertexdata.putnew float[]  x, y1, z1,           vertexdata.putnew float[]  x, y, z,          vertexdata.putnew float[]  x, y1, z,          vertexdata.putnew float[]  x, y1, z1,           ifyA              vertexdata.putnew float[]  x, y, z,          vertexdata.putnew float[]  x, y, z1,          vertexdata.putnew float[]  x1, y, z1,           vertexdata.putnew float[]  x, y, z,          vertexdata.putnew float[]  x1, y, z,          vertexdata.putnew float[]  x1, y, z1,           ifzA              vertexdata.putnew float[]  x, y, z,          vertexdata.putnew float[]  x1, y, z,          vertexdata.putnew float[]  x1, y1, z,           vertexdata.putnew float[]  x, y, z,          vertexdata.putnew float[]  x, y1, z,          vertexdata.putnew float[]  x1, y1, z,            FloatBuffer texturedata  BufferUtils.createFloatBuffer6  2     texturedata.putnew float[]  0f, 0f,      texturedata.putnew float[]  1f, 0f,      texturedata.putnew float[]  1f, 1f,       texturedata.putnew float[]  0f, 0f,      texturedata.putnew float[]  0f, 1f,      texturedata.putnew float[]  1f, 1f,        vertexdata.flip     texturedata.flip      int vbovertexhandle  glGenBuffers     glBindBufferGLARRAYBUFFER, vbovertexhandle     glBufferDataGLARRAYBUFFER, vertexdata, GLSTATICDRAW     glBindBufferGLARRAYBUFFER, 0      int vbotexturehandle  glGenBuffers     glBindBufferGLARRAYBUFFER, vbotexturehandle     glBufferDataGLARRAYBUFFER, texturedata, GLSTATICDRAW     glBindBufferGLARRAYBUFFER, 0      glBindVertexArray0      VBO vbo  new VBOvbovertexhandle, vbotexturehandle, renderEngine.textures.getid, 6, 3, 2      ifid  2transparent         renderEngine.vbos.addvbo     else         renderEngine.vbos.add0, vbo      return vbo  codepre

Negative 653 pI am working on a website where I have to show a table with several different climatic variables max temperature, cloudiness, etc in it for a given month chosen by the user. The basic table is separated by months and all I have to do is go fetch the data in the database and display it in the table. p  pThere is also an other view where we display the same information, but for seasons instead of months. In order to do so, I have process the database information whether it be take the maximum value out of the months of that season, the average of all the values for the months of that season, etc. In order to do that, I have separated all monthly values into different arrays, each containing the values for a given season. Then for each of those arrays, I call codemaxcode or codemincode in a codeswitchcode statement. Of course, to do that, I have to make sure that all the indexes of those arrays actually contain a value, and not the string NA which I insert in them if for a given month there is no values in the database. So I do a check if the array does not contain NA, then call the function codemaxcode or codemincode etc, else just display NA.p  pThe problem that I am having is that all the arrays that contain a codefloat0code in them will go in the codeelsecode statement, which I dont understand why because I am clearly doing my check on whether or not the array contains NA, not if it contains a NULL or empty string or 0. Why am I seeing this behaviorp  pFor reference, here is my codeforeachcode loopp  precode The vardump are there so that I can see what is in my arrays, but will  be removed when this issue is resolved. foreach allSeasonsArray as season      echo nlttdgtn     switchcalculations[0]              case MAX             if inarrayNA, season                              echo maxseason                 vardumpseason                          else                              echo NA                 vardumpseason                          break         case MIN             if inarrayNA, season                                                                 echo minseason                 vardumpseason                          else                              echo NA                 vardumpseason                          break         case MOY             if inarrayNA, season                                                                 echo roundarraysumseason  countseason, 1                 vardumpseason                          else                              echo NA                 vardumpseason                          break         case MED             if inarrayNA, season                              echo roundmedianseason, 1                 vardumpseason                          else                              echo NA                 vardumpseason                          break         case TOT             if inarrayNA, season                                                echo arraysumseason                 vardumpseason                          else                              echo NA                 vardumpseason                          break         default             break          echo nlttdgtn                             codepre

Negative 653 pI am managing a server providing web administration pages and communicating with client apps. I designed the web part which allows the public access through the 80 port. However, I was told from my client that they want the server to allow only the access from their intranet other than outside the company. I thought it can be done if Tomcat has an ability to filter the access to web pages based on IP address. However, I ended up in failing to find out a proper solution for that. I know Tomcat has already provided the filtering function according to a web project. I came up with a way of getting around this problem and used it as follows I make two service tags in server.xml likep  precodeltService nameCatalinagt  ltConnector port80 ...gt  ltService nameCatalina2gt  ltConnector port8080 ...gt  codepre  pAnd make another clone for the additional service. Then, I block all the external accesses through 8080 port by the firewall setup. This lives up to my clients needs. However, this is not a common way, I guess. Even, sometimes, the setting allows the external accesses which shouldnt happen. On top of this, its not an efficient way from the maintaining point of view.p  pAnyhow, I dont like it. It would be appreciated if someone told me the way. Thanks for reading the question.p

Negative 653 pSo Im writing a web app using a MVVM library Vue.JS, but anyone with experience in Angular or any other MVVM library might be able to help.  In the app, the user enters various search parameters, requests the server, and the response is displayed as a number of plotschartsgraphs  anywhere from 1100 of them.p  pSo far Ive used databinding to write templates which automatically generate the graph containers when new data is received from the server and placed into the ViewModel. However the actual drawing of graphs cannot be performed with data binding  it requires the calling of a JavaScript function  in my case, code.highchartscode. Then when the user makes a new search, the current graphs are thrown away and new ones are made. The problem is that temhis whole process makes no use of the MVVM pattern  I cant use data binding if the graphing function doesnt use HTML templatesem I might as well not be using the library at allp  pSo my question is this strongIs there an idiomatic way to use data binding with a plotting librarystrongp  pIf I had just one chart I might be able to construct each chart only once, and then if the user requests new data, I just alter the ViewModel, trigger a chart event, and cause the chart to update itself in a nice visual way. However I have no way of knowing if the chart will even be the same type  the user might have requested a pie chart, and I want to delete a column chart, so this isnt an option.p

Negative 653 pWe have a relatively standard Ruby on Rails project, which has quite a few background jobs that run under Resque with Redis as a backend.p  pThe issue is that very rarely  perhaps once a month, maybe a little less  well suddenly see floods of exceptions from Resque. The exceptions are all in the following veinp  precodeundefined method findbyid for UserClass undefined method findbyname for CustomerAccountClass undefined method findbyid for JobClass codepre  pIt emappearsem that suddenly, all ActiveRecordBase models lose their codefindbycode methods for the entire thread. Restarting the worker fixes the issue.p  pI know that generically, the answer must be someone, somewhere  probably in a gem  is breaking methodmissing somehow. Or perhaps, somehow the constants are getting reassigned to a different class. But before I begin a really thorough investigation, I wanted to check if anyone has run into this problem and solved it already.p  pThis project is running Ruby 2.1.1p76, Rails 3.2.17, Resque 1.25.1.p
Negative 653 pI am trying to write a python script using mpi4py that runs a bunch of executable files using subprocess.Popen and then post processes them after, therefore I would need to know when the executable files have run.p  pI am noticing that mpi4py does not like subprocess.Popen when I run it on a computer cluster. I tried using mpi4pys Spawn but it does not tell me when the executable file has finished running.p  pAny ideas on how I should run the executable files. I will be running thousands of these files on multiple nodes.p
Negative 653 pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comsIgsF.jpg altenter image description herep  pI would like to design something like the photo I placed above, it gives the basic idea of what I am trying to accomplish. I think something like this would allow the users to select based on the appearance of the plates and category.p  pAlso, it shows the user the prices up front and allows users to browse the different plates. I also want where if the user clicks the plate they can see the plate in full size.p  pThe gray boxes in my design represent the images for the plates and undderneath I put the license name, and its price.p  pWhat I had come up with is a combination drop down but I am trying to figure something more like this pop up window instead. Ill have to radio buttons  Yes  No if yes the pop up window like the image appears if no nothing happens except clears the price if a plate was already chosen.p  pAny help would be greatly

Negative 653 pI have a GameObject with a script that has variables that a lot of different scripts call to. For instance, one variable is a Vector2 that all other moving objects in the game use to know which way the map is moving.p  pThis script has a static Instance of itself that it applies itself to on Start.p  pEverything runs great but Im running into an issue where if I edit any of the code while the game is running, when the game loads up the new code and tries to continue, anything that calls from the Instance of the gameObject gets a NullReferenceException.p  pIve tried setting up Singletons in hopes that maybe thatd get around the issue but those have the same effect.p  pDoes anyone know if theres a way to use global instances of a class I found being able to edit the code and refresh it in a live game be extremely useful... tho not as useful as having a static Instance that contains a frequently shared variable.

Negative 653 pI am a little confused as to what happens in this situation.  We have a column that is, say, VARCHAR500 in SQL Server.  The migration tool  MySQL Workbench  truncates the index to 255.  This other a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions27829152forcetruncationonvarcharmodificationposta I found, plus many other places on Google, suggest that 255 is the limit for VARCHAR based indexes.  From this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma164740393329922post herea, I see that it is the first 255 characters.  But I am sort of confused as to how that works out in actual practice.  In other words, if, by dumb luck, I am looking for a substring  using the like clause  that is after the 255 point in the real column, what would happen  Or what would happen if I compare the column using , , etc, but use more than 255 in comparison string.  In these kind of screwy situations, does it just ignore the index, or whatp  pSort of new to MySQL, been working with SQL Server for years, so just trying to understand what to expect.  Thanks.p

Negative 653 pI have QVariantMap not QObject, because property names are not predefined. And I inject QVariantMap into QML root context to use property values for binding.p  pThe problem is that when I change QVariantMap or even when I change QVariantMap and call setContextProperty for updated object, or when I update with fromValue object returned by contextProperty nothing happens. So this looks like one time binding.p  pSo, what is the right way in inject Map or Map into QML context in observable way, so that changing item in the map will be reflected in QMLp
Negative 653 pIn a game I have a GridPane displaying the Tiles of the world in square cells. The player can, using the keyboard, move what is displayed by a columnrow. The approaches Ive thought of are Having the GridPane change programmatically the displayed tiles by moving everything by x steps on player input.  Wrapping the GridPane in a ScrollPane and tying the ScrollPanes scroll to Keyboard input.p  pMy question is, assuming that things that are offsight but on the same map are always loaded, what are the pros and cons of each approach efficiencywise Most specifically, Im wondering if wrapping the GridPane in a ScrollPane would keep the Images loaded even if they are offscreen, thus impacting performance and if in that case it would be better to just reload them when needed. Im also wondering if theres a third, more efficient way I havent thought about.p  pIm using JavaFX8p

Negative 653 pHi Stackoverflow Family,p  pSo this is a pretty big question be prepared to read quite a bit.  Basically my team and I working on an Employee scheduling application were already well into it, so please nothing about changing our stack or anything like that. Anyways, were building this with PHP, Mongo, JavaScript, JQuery, and Bootstrap and Im working more on the db side of things. p  pWhat I really want to find out after asking this question is to see if my current approach to the db is right Ive basically created several collections and documents that reference each other in order to access or reference specific data that Im looking for. If that doesnt really make sense check out my schema below p  pstrongEmployee Collection  Contains indexes such as name, employeeNumber, address, etc, employee availability, position amp department.strong My issue here is I want it to reference other collections which contain their Shift information, but I can only really do that when I insert a document. p  pstrongShift Collection  Contains indexes such as shiftNumber, shiftStartTime, endTimestrong This collection, I basically want to reference to employee, such that for creating each employee I have their shift time connected to it. p  pSchedule Collection   Now for the Schedule collection, this is the one that confuses me the most I basically want our Calendar UI to be able to look through our schedule collection and be able to pull all the shifts in a certain day, or in a specific week. But I have no idea as to how I can approach this from the backend. p  pSo far what Ive done with the Schedule Collection is that Ive mathematically created a Calendar year and placed that within the Schedule basically it contains a document called Year, and in that Year it contains every day of the week with information such as day number, week number, leapYear, etc. p  pAnyways, I hope this is enough information my main confusion is the with the main schedule, I think I nearly have the Employee collection functioning properly since it references the Department class with no issues. I just mainly cant figure out how to implement a full schedule in mongop  pThanks guysp

This publishes Changing and Changed as it does the update.p  pI have something that is subscribed to Metric ID 37 being updated, for example Metric 38, may need to recalculate itself when Metric 37s value changes.p  pMetric 38 is currently instantiated and being used on Node 2 in Process ID 1011... How does Metric 37 tell Metric 38 on Node 2 Process ID 1011 in this case to run the subscribed functionp  pMetric 39 subscribes to Metric 38 being updated, but is not instantiated anywhere... How does Metric 39 update when Metric 38 finishes updatingp  pI was thinking of something like using RabbitMQ as my event queue manager, and on each node have a daemon style event consumer application that reads events in the event queue for sake of load balancingdistribution of the work.p  pThen the consumer sees Metric38Updated it checks something like Redis for anything subscribed to Metric38Updated and gets the value WhatFunctionValues and does something like calluserfuncarrayarraywhat,function,values .... but this seems like it may cause a crapload of overhead and some level of synchronization issues...p  pIm using Doctrine MongoDB ODM to persist my objects... To handle synchronization issues I was thinking of something like this Objects could have a version number... version1.0 And redis could be used to maintain a quick reference to the latest version of the object ObjectVersionObjectTypeObjectId1.1 And when a getter is called on an object property that is marked as criticalthings like isDeleted, monetary balances etc it could check if the instances version ID is equal to the version  in redis and update its values from mongo if it needs to...p  pAn alternate setup is using ampamphp a hrefhttpamphp.github.ioampeventreactorconcepts relnofollowhttpamphp.github.ioampeventreactorconceptsa and some form of RPC to synchronize the nodesp  pSince Im fairly new to web development moving from c and stateless, and distributed..

Negative 653 pIm try implementing this funcionalityp  pThe xpage can be open from Sharepoint Portal or directly from application option interface. The problem is that portal Sharepoint the xpages opens in a Iframe and must be redimensioned. To redimension the xpages Im using a css that executes the redimension. The application knows if it opens in iframe, it executes javascript code in onclientload event of xpage. The communication between client and server side is using remote services with argument the information its a iframe or no. It works but executes after hrefs resource computation property of xpage. The question is there how change execution sequence Or is there anyway to implement this funcionalityp  pThanks a lotp  pMarcusp
Negative 653 pIm using Docker 1.5.0 on a Ubuntu 14.04 LTS VirtualBox Guest OS. Im trying to get a clamd Docker container running. When Docker is not in the picture, starting clamd is fairly straightforward.  But when using Docker, applications which normally run as daemons background should be run in foreground as Docker itself is the daemon.  Ive set Foreground to be true in the clamd.conf file.  I get no errors when trying to start the Docker container in daemonized mode, but it shuts down right away.  When running the Docker container interactively and starting clamd in the background, I soon get the error message ERROR LOCAL Socket file varrunclamavclamd.ctl could not be removed Is a directory.  Ive looked at all public DockerHub examples that pertain to clamav for hints on how others have actually made clamd work inside a Docker container either Im missing something obvious or these examples really dont work.p  pThanks, Ken Wolcottp

Negative 653 pI require a long loop long enough to make the browser hang if I used it naively. The contents of this loop requires other javascript fileslibraries and I dont like the idea of concatonating them all into one file as this would make it harder to maintain. So as far as I understand this rules out web workers, Are there any other solutions out there p  pI need the contents of the loop to run as fast as possible so any delay that can be measured in ms is unacceptable, any fixed delay at all would not be ideal.p  pI might be able to concatonate them all into a blob at runtime and then feed that into a web worker, I havnt really looked into this to far bc it doesnt seem like a good solution.p
Negative 653 pI need to associate a collection of objects with a User through an intermediary object using some complex logic. Rather than building the full association and creating the intermediary object immediately, I want to do that later, so I want to just store these pending relationships on the User object for now, but I cant seem to find a way to do that unless the tables have a relationship in the database which they dont since the intermediate object doesnt exist yet. I could just use a vanilla Python attribute for this, but then if the session refreshes, the old value is still present, referencing objects bound to an old session. Alternately, I tried storing the info in a hrefhttpdocs.sqlalchemy.orgenlatestormsessionapi.htmlsqlalchemy.orm.session.Session.info relnofollowcodeSession.infocodea, but if the object isnt bound to a session, that fails as well.p  pI can see a broader usecase here for an arbitrary sessionbound attribute that behaves like a a hrefhttpdocs.sqlalchemy.orgenlatestormrelationshipapi.htmlsqlalchemy.orm.relationship.params.lazy relnofollowcodenoloadcodea, a hrefhttpdocs.sqlalchemy.orgenlatestormrelationshipapi.htmlsqlalchemy.orm.relationship.params.viewonly relnofollowcodeviewonlycodea relationship. It is bound to the session, but only if the object is bound to a session, and if the session refreshes, the attribute refreshes with it. Is there a way to achieve this in SQLAlchemyp  pHeres some code that illustrates what Im talking about. Obviously in this case, you wouldnt use a codenoloadcode, codeviewonlycode relationship, but Im just using it to illustrate...p  precodeclass UserDeclarativeBase     tablename  users     id  ColumnInteger, primarykeyTrue      posts  relationshipPost, lazynoload, viewonlyTrue     value  arbitraryattrthatworksthesameway   class PostDeclarativeBase     tablename  posts     id  ColumnInteger, primarykeyTrue     userid  ColumnInteger, ForeignKeyusers.id  ...  user  User post  Post user.posts.appendpost user.value  5  user.posts gt [ltPost 1gt] user.value gt 5   session1  Session session1.adduser  user.posts gt [ltPost 1gt] user.value gt 5  session1.close   session2  Session session2.adduser  user.posts gt [] user.value gt None  session2.close codepre

Then I try to fit the rest of the spectrum with the loess function. p  pMy problem now is that if the removal of peaks doesnt work perfectly there are still some points left which are clearly not background. p  pIs there a way to tell the fit not to go over the data, i.e. having the fitted line always below the data points which is clearly what you want from a baseline My hope is that, if I am able to constrain the fit to be below the data points I can find suitable parameters, so that the remaining points from the peaks are ignored.p  pThanks Johnp

Negative 653 pSo Ive been looking everywhere for an answer. Including jQuerys datepicker API website and I cant seem to find a suitable answer.p  pThis is what I would like to happen. When the text field is pressed and the datepicker pops up, I would like the calendar month to show this month, rather than defaulting to any previously selected date.p  pI still want to be able to select next and previous on the months. So setting minDate is not an option.p  pSo for example, a user has previously selected 03032013. The user then clicks the textbox, which pops up the date picker again, the month displayed is todays month rather than March. However, 03032013 is still selected.p  pThanksp  pCode is very vanilla...p  precodedocument.readyfunction   .datePickerShowToday.datepicker             dateFormat ddmmyy,             buttonText Click here to select a date,             onSelect function                           codepre  pHTML Codep  precodeltinput typetext idNotificationDate classdatePickerShowToday gt codepre

Negative 653 pI have spent much of the last few weeks struggling through making a few userforms not one of my strengths. With my intended userform the user can select whatever values they want to on a spreadsheet for example asset prices and then apply the spinner, this mimics an increasedecrease of a  in the price of those assets etc and then they can observe how this impacts various aspects of the business. Then they have two buttons, one that can keep the adjusted values and another to reset the values. p  pSo far I have one userform that appears to work over various sheets but the selected ranges have to be contiguous and one, with great help on here see a previous question from myself, that works perfectly for noncontiguous selections however they have to be on the same worksheet.

Negative 653 pI have created an object, lets call it EventObject, that will hold the results of an SQL query. Initially the objects will be aggregated into a single ArrayList. I am trying to develop a method that will look at each EventObject in the ArrayList, and if it equals a given value of a categorical factor, copies it to another group. p  pFor example, if a Timestamp value for EventObject1 falls on a Sunday, copy the object into a Sunday level of a Weekday factor if that same Timestamp falls in the month of May, copy it into a May level of a Month factor as well, etc. p  pI am stuck as to what type of data structures would be most efficient for sorting. I do not know how many EventObject will fall into a level of a given factor, and the number of factors to be analyzed will be dependent upon an ID I pass to the method. It is required that I will have K factors, each with a known number of levels and each level can have any number of EventObjects after the soring occurs. p  pShould I attempt to hold all factors together in a single ArrayList This requires a 3 dimensional structure. Would it be more prudent to create a separate data structure for each factor p

Negative 653 pI wrote a simple crossplatform utility to verify GPG signatures using the a hrefhttpswww.gnupg.orgitrelatedsoftwaregpgmeindex.html relnofollowgpgmea. However gpgme doesnt work very well on windows and on other platforms e.g. osx it requires GnuPG command line utilities installed which is a pretty heavy dependency. I looked into other openpgp libraries as well such as a hrefhttpwww.netpgp.com relnofollownetgpga but these are even less portable it really has to build with mingww64.p  pWould it be possible to implement a standalone tool to verify GPG signature using only standard libraries like openssl and zlib From what I understand openpgp consists of standard ciphers and hash functions.

Negative 653 pMy app works with regular webview but its very slow under Android 4.0  4.2 and just slow on 4.3 and 4.4.p  pIve already done lot of optimalizations in htmljscss, but still is too slow. So decided to take a look at Crosswalk project.p  pIts almost all great even with 20mb size for apk, except for one thing..p  pYou cannot create XWalkView equivalent of WebView with Service context like you can do with regular WebView only Activity context is an option for Crosswalk view.p  pWhy its badp  pThe website that I load into WebViewXWalkView uses WebSockets, it has to be always alive But Android likes to kill apps, especially on older devices with Android 4.04.2.p  pSolution is to create WebView with Service context and keep reference to it in Service Service is in foreground mode so hard to kill.p  pThen if Activity will crash or will be garbagecollected, simply user taps to it, Activity recreates himself and gets reference to WebView from Service class to add it to his hierarchy again.  and in the meantime when activity didnt exist, webview was still working along with websocket connectionp  pAll works, but with WebView and WebView is slow..p  pWhy I am writing it Need advice from you what to do or maybe solution how to force CrossWalk view to works with Service context.p  pIs it other way to keep XWalkView always alivep  pThanksp

Thus i want an input box that allows user to select the table of cells they want to perform this function .I know how an input box works however the given code goes by rows and columns, something of which the range that the user selects, does not contain .

Negative 653 pI am relatively new to python and am trying to understand how to relate Python with CC. Consider the problem Check if a given Linked List is a Palindrome. From this a hrefhttpwww.geeksforgeeks.orgfunctiontocheckifasinglylinkedlistispalindrome relnofollowsourcea, I found a very effective solutionp  precode Initial parameters to this function are amphead and head bool isPalindromeUtilstruct node left, struct  node right      stop recursion when right becomes NULL     if right  NULL       return true      If sublist is not palindrome then no need to        check for current left and right, return false     bool isp  isPalindromeUtilleft, rightgtnext    if isp  false       return false      Check values at current left and right     bool isp1  rightgtdata  leftgtdata      Move left to next node     left  leftgtnext     return isp1    A wrapper over isPalindromeUtil bool isPalindromestruct node head     isPalindromeUtilamphead, head  codepre  pBasically a pointer to pointer is assigned to the front left pointer and a pointer is assigned to the end of the list right pointer. Once the pointers reach their respective positions, they recurse through and find match the values. Here, left maintains the state of the pointer to pointer whose value persists through the recursive loop. One of the solutions in python would be passing the left pointer back along with the boolean value. However if there are multiple pointer to pointers being used, the number of return elements explode Bad design. Is there any other way of doing itp  pEDITp  pThank you so much for the responses I forgot to mention that Im not trying to solve the Palindrome problem here. I am trying to understand if there is a Pythonic equivalent way of working with pointers. What I am trying to comprehend is when if a question is posed to me, which uses data structures such as linked list, should I try to convert it into other data structures such as list or if I need to be creative and solve the question using the same data structure. Since pointer to pointer is pretty important concept in Linked List and BST, is there an equivalent solution or work around for this conceptp  pEdit 2 The rough code I have come up with is as below. However, the leftptr remains stuck in the same position since its a pointer and not pointer to pointerp  precodedef palindromeutilsself, leftptr, rightptr         if rightptr is None                 return True         prevresult  self.palindromeutilsleftptr, rightptr.getlink          curresult  leftptr.getdata  rightptr.getdata         leftptr  leftptr.getlink         return curresult and prevresult  def palindromeself         return self.palindromeutilsself.head, self.head codepre
