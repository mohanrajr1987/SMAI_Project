Positive 7429 pI have seen how we can provide default conditions and default actions to newly created bucket items. I also know that we can create a custom rule for building path based on custom date field. p  pBut, how can we set the item path when the date field is and the is saved. Consider an example. We have a bucket item template say News which has a date field say Release Date. We have the settings where on item creation, the item path has the creation date like News20150916item1. Now, we need to have some logic where we can change the path when the release date of item1 is updated and the item is strongSavedstrong.p  pHow can we update the item path when items release date is updated and item is Saved  do i need to implement some logic in OnItemSaved method p  pI already went through posts on a hrefhttpwww.geekhive.combuzzpost20154howtocreatecustomitembucketrulesinsitecorecms relnofollowGeekHiveap
Positive 7429 pWe have a Sitecore site thats using Glass.Mapper. We also have a simple two step workflow, Draft  Ready for publish on all items.

Positive 7429 pLets say I have a data template that has 3 field sections Basic Info, Navigation Info and Content Info.  I would like to restrict Field Write access to the fields in these sections by role.  I know that it is fairly simple to create a role for each of these and deny Field Write for the other sections.  For example, I could create a role called Basic Info Editor Role and deny Field Write for all of the fields in the Navigation Info and Content Info sections.  However I need to have the ability for a given user to be a member of more than one role sometimes.  So I may have a user called jSmith that is a member of both the Basic Info Editor Role and also the Navigation Info Editor Role.  I want jSmith to be able to edit both of those sections of content.p  pI cant figure out how to do this.  It seems that by default all users have Field Write access to all templates.  I think somehow I need to remove inheritance so that they dont all have the Field Write granted or something.  Any ideasp

Positive 7429 pSo I have a couple of search helper methods in C which uses SOLR as the search engine. These methods return list of pages  suggestions from Sitecore.

Positive 7429 pIm trying to figure out a way to capture all exceptions of a specific type that occur before the Render method in the page lifecycle, store them and bypass the YSOD error handler.

Right now, if a content author forgets to attach the associated data, they get a YSOD and freak out.  The idea here is that the rest of the page continues to function, and there is a log entry and an HTML comment pointing to the problem. Maybe Ill create some warning dialog to let them know that there is something missing.p

I need them to run when I call them in the order I want to call them, which brings me back to my original question is there anyway to reuse a loop with a different cursorp  pThanks again.p  phr p  pI am creating a package Oracle 10 in which I have 4 different select statements possibly more to come all of which I create a cursor for and get my data.

All of which are cursors getting different information from very different selects but they are all going into the same table with my insert statement in the loop.  Also I cannot join all the selects together, they have to be done in order with a commit after each loop  p  pI created an example below with 4 loops but as you can see they are all the same, the only difference is   For r in c1 loop,  For r in c2 loop ...

Negative 7429 pFor some reason, Ive always assumed that codereadonlycode fields have overhead associated with them, which I thought of as the CLR keeping track of whether or not a codereadonlycode field has been initialized or not. The overhead here would be some extra memory usage to keep track of the state and a check when assigning a value. p  pPerhaps I assumed this because I didnt know a codereadonlycode field could only be initialized inside a constructor or within the field declaration itself and without a runtime check, you wouldnt be able to guarantee its not being assigned to multiple times in various methods. But now I know this, it could easily be statically checked by the C compiler, right So is that the case p  pAnother reason is that Ive read that the usage of codereadonlycode has a slight performance impact, but they never went into this claim and I cant find information on this subject, hence my question. I dont know what other performance impact there might be aside from runtime checks. p  pA third reason is that I saw that codereadonlycode is preserved in the compiled IL as codeinitonlycode, so what is the reason for this information to be in the IL if codereadonlycode is nothing more than a guarantee by the C compiler that the field is never assigned to outside of a constructor or declarationp  pOn the other hand, Ive found out you can set the value of a codereadonly intcode through reflection without the CLR throwing an exception, which shouldnt be possible if codereadonlycode was a runtime check. p  pSo my guess is the readonlyness is only a compile time feature, can anyone confirmdeny this And if it is, what is the reason for this information to be included in the IL p

Negative 7429 pIm writing a C.NET program which uses XmlSerializer to serialize and deserialize the project the current user is working on to and from an XML file. This is working fine, but Im trying to figure out a way to prevent two users from opening the same file off a network drive and having one user overwrite the previous users save. I essentially want the behavior that MS Word has, where if the program can not gain write access to a file when it is being opened it opens the file in a read only mode.p  pSo how do I lock access to a file Do I just leave a file stream object open and keep a reference to it Do I continue to use the same filestream object for any intermediate saves rather then opening and closing them for each save Or is there some other way to lock access to a file p  pAlso how do I ensure that the file is released even if my app crashes Would this be a good case to implement IDisposablep

Negative 7429 pMy question is as follows I have given a workbook to multiple people.  They have this workbook in a folder of their choice.  The workbook name is the same for all people, but folder locations vary. Lets assume the common file name is MyData1.xls. Now I have updated the workbook and want to give it to these people.  However when they receive the new one lets call it MyData2.xls I want specific parts of their data pulled from their file MyData1 and automatically put into the new one provided MyData2. The columns and cells to be copiedimported are identical for both workbooks.  Lets assume I want to import cell data values only from MyData1.xls, Sheet 1, cells B8 through C25 ... to ... the same location in the MyData2.xls workbook.  How can I specify in code possibly attached to a macro driven import data now button that I want this data brought into this new workbook.  I have tried it at my own location by opening the two workbooks and using the copypastespecial with links process.  It works really well, but It seems to create a hard link between the two physical workbooks.  I changed the name of the source workbook and it still worked.  This makes me believe that there is a hard link between the tow and that this will not allow me to give the target MyData2.xls workbook to others and have it find their source workbook.p

Negative 7429 pI need to write a linux c app which saves it settings in XML format for easy hand editing and also communicates with existing apps through XML messages over sockets and HTTP. Problem is that I havent been able to find any intelligent libs to help me, I dont particular feel like writing DOM or SAX code just to write and read some very simple messages.p  pBoost Serialization was almost a match, but it adds a lot of boostspecific data to the xml it generates. This obviously doesnt work well for interchange formats. Im wondering if it is possible to make Boost Serialization or some other c serialization library generate clean xml. I dont mind if there are some required extra attributes  like a version attribute, but Id really like to be able to control their naming and also get rid of features that I dont use  trackinglevel and classid for instance. p  pIdeally I would just like to have something similar to xstream in Java. I am aware of the fact that c lacks introspection and that it is therefore necessary to do some manual coding  but it would be nice if there was a clean solution to just read and write simple XML without kludgesp  pIf this cannot be done I am also interested in tools where the XML schema is the canonical resource contract first  a good JAXB alternative to C. So far I have only found commercial solutions like CodeSynthesis XSD. I would prefer open source solutions. I have tried gSoap  but it generates really ugly code and it is also SOAPspecific.p  pIn desperation I also started looking at alternative serialization formats for protobuffers. This exists  but only for Java It really surprises me that protocol buffers seems to be a better supported data interchange format than XML.p  pIm going mad just finding libs for this app and I really need some new ideas.

Negative 7429 pIs it possible to quickly run singleall integration test in a class quickly in Grails. The testapp comes with heavy baggage of clearing of all compiled files and generating cobertura reports hence even if we run single integration test, the entire code base is compiled,instrumented and the cobertura report is getting generated. For our application this takes more than 2 minutes.p  pIf it was possible to quickly run one integration test and get a rapid feedbck, it would be immensely helpful.p  pAlso, is it important to clean up all the compiled files once the test is complete This cleaning is fine if we run the entire set of integration test, but if we are going to run one or two tests in a class this cleaning and recompiling seems to be a big bottleneck for quicker feedback to developers. p  pThanksp

Negative 7429 pI have a Console App created in VS 2010 targeting .NET 4.0.  According to a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combrmbyersarchive20090608anycpuexesareusuallymoretroublethentheyreworth.aspx relnofollowMicrosoft Rick Byersa AnyCPU is no longer the default for Console Apps because, in the Microsoft way, they emfeelem like it is a better idea to default to x86.  Also, the option to change the platform to AnyCPU, or x64 for that matter, does not seem to be available.  p  pNow, I have this Console app that I am building, and I have a Class Library project where I am writing unit tests in NUnit I practice TDD. So, the issue is that when I go to implement the code to make my tests pass they still fail.  After a while I found that it is because even when I do it from the solution level when the project rebuilds it is not rebuilding the console app project.  This causes the reference to not get updated in my unit tests which of course means my test is executing against old code and not the newly imlemented code.  Big problem.p  pCurrently, I am having to rightclick the console app and select rebuild, then rightclick the test project and select rebuild EVERY time before I run my tests.  This is extremely annoying.p  pSo, back to the question, how can I make VS2010 rebuild my Console App and update the reference in my class library automatically like it did in older versions of Visual Studiop  pPlease do not answer with add a build event to do it.

Negative 7429 pId like to design a JVM data structure JavaScala that can be used to represent and store the contents of arbitrary relational database tables.  The data structure should be fast not too gcintensive, cachefriendly and memory efficient, so larger tables can fit in RAM.p  pOne memoryefficient solution is to store each column separately in a primitive array, but Im worried about the cache friendliness because items in the same row are not stored together.  A row with N columns will incur N cache misses, no matter how narrow the columns.p  pAnother solution is to store each row in an object array where each element represents a field and is cast to the correct type on retrieval, but this requires storing numeric types in their boxed form, so its not very memoryefficient.  And its probably not that cache efficient either.p  pAnother solution is to layout each rows data into a byte array the same way real databases serialize their rows, using only as many bytes as necessary.  This is cachefriendly and memory efficient, but Im concerned about the cost of serializationdeserialization on every access.p  pWhats the best wayp

Negative 7429 pI have been implementing binary tree search algorithm recently in R, and before that I used linked arraylike structures. These algorithm would be much easier if there were pointers in R not C pointers, but references to objects. I wonder if there is a workaround. I dont know S4 at all maybe it is possible in that framework I would avoid environmentrelated tricks, since that passbyreference is a little too bit of a workaround. And I would avoid invocations of C or Cs STL. Its an R question after all.p

Negative 7429 pIm having a problem using RMagickImageMagick to open a file uploaded through a Rails form. I believe this is due to the fact that Rails Tempfile behavior is to eliminate the file extension. From what Ive read, ImageMagick should prefer to use magic number rather than file extension to detect the image file format, but that doesnt seem to be the case in my installation. Im doing thisp  precodeimg  MagickImage.readfullsizeimage.path codepre  pwhere fullsizeimage is the Tempfile object returned from the upload form controller, which creates an error like p  blockquote   pno decode delegate for this image format varfoldersuIuIsldaxoHkiXKWYFuTWs4TITmpRackMultipart20101031101441hiwlw0  errorconstitute.cReadImage532p blockquote  pThis is happening on Mac OS X 10.6 with Rails 2.3.8, RMagick 2.13.1 and ImageMagick 6.6.55. Ive confirmed that ImageMagick can convert the file Ive been using to test through the upload form successfully, and that the tempfile pathfile actually existsis readable.p  pI suspect that either a something in my ImageMagick installation is somehow preventing it from using magic number to detect the file type   getting ImageMagick working on Snow Leopard from source was an adventure itself or b there are just cases where this doesnt work and I somehow need to make Tempfile preserve the original file extension.p  pI know that I can get the original file name from the Tempfile object, but I havent found a way to rename the file. I suppose I could make some kludge where I use a File object and somehow create a copy of the Tempfile with the original extension on it, but that just seems unseemly. Whats the right way to solve this problemp  pThanks for your help.p

Negative 7429 pI am a tinkererno doubt about that.

A curiosity and little more. But then I had this hunch my 64bit CPU emshouldem actually be able to copy 64 bits atomically, right So what if I got rid of codeZcode and just stuck with codeXcode and codeYcode Thats only 64 bits it should be possible to overwrite those in one step.p  pstrongSure enough, it worked.strong I realize some of you are probably furrowing your brows right now, thinking, emYeah, duh. How is this even interestingem Humor me. Granted, I have no idea whether this is guaranteed or not given my system. I know next to nothing about registers, cache misses, etc. I am literally just regurgitating terms Ive heard without understanding their meaning so this is all a black box to me at the moment.p  pThe next thing I triedagain, just on a hunchwas a struct consisting of 32 bits using 2 codeshortcode fields. This seemed to exhibit atomic assignability as well.

Negative 7429 pI have a locationbased iOS 4 app that relies on significant location change monitoring while in the background. Apples docs statep  blockquote   pAt wakeup time, your application is   put into the background and given a   small amount of time to process the   location data.

I perform a combination of setting focus and showinghiding the subdialogs when the user clicks through the listbox.p  pWhen the user selects Save These heshe is presented with another dialog that allows them to check which specific preference panes they want to save to generate XML configuration files. Obviously I need to scrape the dialog for their inputs, but when the program reaches the point in the code where it calls UpdateData, the program fails, because Im calling UpdateData before calling DoModal.p  pNow Im not really sure how to go about getting the values. It doesnt help either that Im very new to MFC. So theres that. Anyhow, I would appreciate any help that anyone can offer.p  p Jonp

Negative 7429 pOk, Im working on my Operating Systems assignment. I need to write a microkernel which is able to do some basic stuff with threads, semaphores, events, etc. BCC 3.1 is imitating my system environment. Classical debugging is really not of use. Im debugging in cout style. Problem is weird behavior of cout. It writes out in blocks or something. If I do, like, 40 couts it writes everything out. If I do 39 of them, it doesnt write any of them. On other hand if i do between 40 and 79 couts, it still writes only first 40, but if I do 80 of them, theyre all ok, etc. Numbers are not exact, Im not sure whats the number really. But I have also noticed that changing the length of string that is couted effects the same way. Only I dont know how many characters equals one cout call. Additional information available upon request. Thanks in forward.p

Negative 7429 pSo, Im still reading Apress Pro Javascript Techniques and im having troubles with closures.p  pAs John Resig statesp  blockquote   pClosures allow you to reference variables that exist within the parent function.   However it does not provide the value of the variable at the time it is created It provides the last value of the variable withing the parent function. The most common issue under which youll see this occurr during a for loop. There is one variable being used as an interaor e.g., i. Inside of the for loop, new functions are being created that utilize the closure to reference the iterator again. The rpoblem is tat the time the new closured functions are called, they will reference the last value of the iterator i.e., the last position in an array, not the value taht you woul expect.p blockquote  pThen he presents, in listing 216 an example using anonymous functions to induce scope.p  precode   Listing 216.

Not that I care about 1.2MB of storage, but 426KB looks much nicer when downloading and in general.p  pAlso, I have heard  not tested  that some programs perform better on startup when compressed because reading from the harddisk is more expensive than decompressing.p  pSo is it recommended to compress your executables on a release buildp

Negative 7429 pIm a very experienced developer  done a lot of heavy duty work with Delphi, C and C for years.

I am impressed by its many wonderful features  but I sorely miss the builtin constraints that make it easy to keep code modularized and organized. And, unfortunately, I see an awful lot of spaghetti code out there written in Python, even from very respectable sources.

Negative 7429 pSo, I realize that this covers a wide array of topics and pieces of them have been covered before on StackOverflow, such as a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions49263approximatestringmatchingalgorithmsthis questiona.  Similarly, a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiSequencealignment relnofollowPartial String Matchinga and a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiApproximatestringmatching relnofollowApproximate String Matchinga are popular algorithmic discussions, it seems.  However, using these ideas in conjunction to suit a problems where both need to be discussed seems highly inefficient.  Im looking for a way to combine the two problems in to one solution, efficiently.p  pRight now, Im using AppEngine with Java and the Persistent DataStore.  This is somewhat annoying, since it doesnt seem to have any arithmetic usage in the queries to make things easier, so Im currently considering doing some precalculation and storing it as an extra field in the database.  Essentially, this is the idea that a friend and I were having on how to possibly implement a system for matching and I was more or less hoping for suggestions on how to make it more efficient.  If it needs to be scrapped in favor of something better that already exists, I can handle that, as well.p  hr  pLets start off with a basic example of what Id look to do a search for.  Consider the following nonsense sentencep  blockquote   pThe isolating layer rackets the principal beneath your hypocritical rubbish.p blockquote  pIf a user does a search for p  blockquote   pemisalatig priemp blockquote  pI would think that this would be a fairly good starting match for the string, and the value should be returned.  The current method that we are considering using basically assigns a value to test divisibility.  Essentially, there is a table with the following datap  precodeA 2        B 3        C 5 D 7        E 11       F 13 ... codepre  pwith each character being mapped to a prime number multiple characters dont make a difference, only one character is needed.  And if the query string divides the string in the database, then the value is returned as a possible match.p  pAfter this, keywords that arent listed as stopwords are compared from the search string to see if they are starting substrings of words in the possible match under a given threshold of an edit distance currently using the Levenshtein distance.p  precodedistanceisalatig, isolating  2 distancepri, principal  0  since principal has a starting                                     substring of pri it passes codepre  pThe total distance for each query is then ranked in ascending order and the top codencode values are then returned back to the person doing the querying.p  hr  pThis is the basic idea behind the algorithm, though since this is my first time dealing with such a scenario, I realize that Im probably missing something very important or my entire idea may be wrong.  What is the best way to handle the current situation that Im trying to implement.  Similarly, if there are any utilities that AppEngine currently offers to combat what Im trying to do, please let me know.p

Negative 7429 pI want to create a Rails application which exposes an API to be consumed by only authorised client applications will be mobile apps for iOS  android. Ive not started working on the app yet, but the primary method of accessing the underlying data will be through the api. Ive been looking at using the a hrefhttpsgithub.comintrideagrape relnofollowgrapea gem, but would need to add an authentication layer to it. I was thinking about using a hrefhttpsgithub.complataformatecdevise relnofollowdevisea and adding another model for storing client details, api key and secret key. Upon sign in through the api, the api key and secret are returned. The API key is transmitted with each request, but the secret key is not. Instead, it is used to sign each request the request parameters are ordered by name, hashed using the secret key as the hash key. This signature is then added as a parameter to the request.p  pDoes this system of authentication sound logical and securep  pI tried to prototype the system earlier, but ran into difficulty signing up a user using JSON with devise. At first I was getting a CSRF error. I then turned off protectfromforgery and was getting another error. Is it safe to turn this off if I am authenticating in this wayp

Negative 7429 pI have a file in one of our projects that defines a variable that affects the behavior of most of the other modules throughout the project.  Lets call it codecustom.hcode.  It looks like thisp  precodepragma once  define BUILD 3  1 personal, 2 select, 3 elite codepre  pThroughout the project there are numerous references to this variable to control behavior between product editions.  Changing this value triggers a rebuild of most of the project.  What Id like to do is create separate Build Configurations, one for each edition, so that it only rebuilds modified files, not the entire project, when I make a change to the edition.p  pIf I have three Configurations, one for each edition, is there a way to get Visual Studio not to rebuild when a change is made to this codecustom.hcode file if the edition matched what was built for that Configuration already  IE, if I set BUILD to 3 and build with the Elite Configuration, then change BUILD to 2 and build with the Select Configuration, I dont want it to rebuild the whole project, because the Intermediary Files for Select should already exist.p  pThe Configurations all have their own Intermediary Directories as well as their own Output Directories.

Negative 7429 pIve always heard and believed that stored procedures are the heart of an SQL database and theyre the most optimal objects to use for many purposes. Many people even use stored procedures instead of triggers. In my Delphi application I query a table with 20.000 rows, each row consisting of about 20 columns. When I do this with stored procedure it takes about 3 seconds to load but if I use queries it takes less than a second. This is very important because the table is going to hold more that a million records. I need to choose the best optimal way as Im convinced that it will never be less than 10 seconds when the table is full with that many records. How come a stored procedure takes longer than ad hoc queries.p
Negative 7429 pI have a base class and a derived class described below, and a single property, TestProperty.  My goal is to get the value I set in testproperty to be serialized inside intializecomponent.  This is very KEY because at a later point, i need the base class to have access to the new value of this property at designtime, and unless that value is set in intializecomponent, I wont have access to this new, default value if you well however, i dont think the defaultvalueattribute is relevant in this case.p  pIn the case below, the only way to get my property to serialize is if I open up derived in the designer and manually set the property to a new value.p  pIm concerned that a custom codedomserializer is going to be the solution, but im very much trying to avoid that.  I want base to have as little code as possible.p  pHow can I get my property set wherever i can get it from, in code to get jammed into initializecomponent with editing it from the designerp  precodepublic partial class Base  Form           public Base                 InitializeComponent          TestProperty  set in the base class              [DesignerSerializationVisibilityDesignerSerializationVisibility.Visible]       public string TestProperty                 get          set            codepre  pAnd a simple derived classp  precodepublic partial class Derived  Base           public Derived                 InitializeComponent          this.TestProperty  i want to be packed into initializecomponent somehow            codepre  pSome more information on why Im trying to do what I am doing. p  pMy problem is this, when I have derived open in the designer, i have a custom editorcontrol bieng used to edit some property, called editableproperty.  EditableProperty needs access to TestProperty in this case.  At runtime, its no problem, I have full access to Derived as a type, and its no problem.p  pThe problem is that the EditorControl im using is in a different assembly, and it for whatever reason, i think its because its in a different assembly than derived, doesnt load the new value i set in the contructor of derived.p  pBasically, when i open derived in the designer and try to use a custom editor, it gets set in base class as the value for TestProperty.   I need to have TestProperty set in initializecomponent in order for my editorcontrol to see the value.p

Negative 7429 pOk Im a total web newbie but I must admit Im totally hooked now.

Negative 7429 pThis is a minor question, but Im kind of stumped.p  psqlite has a hard limit on the number of query parameters, of 999. This is set in headers which are not part of the public header file, and the runtime gives you the ability to lower the limit, but not exceed the hard limit. The Python sqlite3 module on Snow Leopard and Lion as well, apparently allows more parameters than this, however, and I cant figure out for the life of me how this is possible.p  pI considered the possibility that the Python wrapper is doing the parameter substitution itself and passing full statements to sqlite3 but as far as I can tell from the source code, thats not happening. I also considered the possibility that the implementation of sqlite3 on Snow Leopard was compiled from slightly different source code but it turns out that Apple publishes its opensource modifications see a hrefhttpopensource.apple.comsourceSQLiteSQLite74.11httpopensource.apple.comsourceSQLiteSQLite74.11a and the parameter limit in their source is identical to the default.p  pIf someone has an idea about how this might be happening and Im certain its happening Ive created statements with 2000 parameters and they work fine, please chime in. For what its worth, I encountered this oddity because the identical code breaks on Windows, due to the parameter limit.p

Negative 7429 pAccording to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma9235624115145this answera, and validated by testing, when you use Android Beam to push over an NFC message containing an AAR record, the receiving device will start the codeMAINcodecodeLAUNCHERcode activity for the app specified in the AAR.p  pThat codeMAINcodecodeLAUNCHERcode codeIntentcode does not contain the codeNfcAdapter.EXTRANDEFMESSAGEScode extra. Hence, the data that we went through all the trouble to beam over appears to be lost if you use AAR.p  pIs there some way to get the NFC messages that triggered the app to be started in this scenariop  pAnd if the answer is no, then what is the use case of AAR I can see where it might be helpful when the desired app does not exist on the receiving device brings up Play Store, but then once the app is installed, AAR foils any attempt to deliver data from one device to the other, which is kinda the point behind NFC.p  pThanksp

This value will be taken from the 3000 and shown on the screen, however the problem lies in how i can now get the new total value to be 3000  the money raised, so the next time they enter their fundraised amount it subtracts form the new value. p  pThis is what i have so farp  precodefloat mR  float total  3000mR mR  total[moneyRaised.text floatValue]  moneyRaised.text   leftToRaise.text  [[NSString alloc] initWithFormat.2f, mR] codepre

Negative 7429 pI am well aware of the INotifyPropertyChanged and INotifyCollectionChanged for WPF binding.  This has been implemented and is working as expected.  Therefore, changes to a property on our entities will set their IsDirty flag.  Which in turn, turns on the Save functionality, all via binding, beautiful you may say.p  pHowever, we recently had a change request raised to request that the Save button should become enabled as soon as the field changes i.e. use presses the first keystroke, much like the strongundostrong application command does when you type in a textbox.  Therefore the save button must know when every field is changed on the form instead of the property being changed in the entity via binding.p  pThe main reason for this request for help, is one of our forms only has one field that changes everything else normally remains default, but the user still has to tab out of the field to enable the Save button, instead of just being able to save straight away.p

Negative 7429 pIm using an codeNSOperationQueuecode and queuing up codeNSOperationBlockscode. Now, blocks have a strong reference to any instances in the block, and the calling object also has a strong hold on the block, so it has been advised to do something like the followingp  precodeweak Cell weakSelf  self NSBlockOperation op  [NSBlockOperation blockOperationWithBlock         UIImage image   render some image           what if by the time I get here self no longer exists          [[NSOperationQueue mainQueue] addOperationWithBlock             [weakSelf setImageViewImageimage]         ]     ]     [self.renderQueue addOperationop] codepre  pSo, my question is, lets say that by the time the image finishes rendering and that line comes back, the codeCellcode object no longer exists it has been deallocated, possibly due to cell reuse, which is a bit difficult to formalize. When I go to access code[weakSelf setImageViewImage]code, will that cause a codeEXCBADACCESScode error p  pCurrently Im trying to trace what the cause of my problem is, and Im thinking it might have something to do with this.p
Negative 7429 pIm reading through the optimizer documentation for quite a while, but it seems like I cant figure it. The doc saysp  blockquote   pThe optimizer will only combine modules that are specified in arrays   of string literals that are passed to toplevel require and define   calls, or the requirename string literal calls in a simplified   CommonJS wrapping. So, it will not find modules that are loaded via a   variable namep blockquote  pOK so far so good. This basically means emr.jsem wont include nor crawl nested dependencies. Now lets assume we have a main application file which looks like the followingp  precoderequire[ es5shim, tools ], function      console.logfictive app entry point      require[ domready ], function doc           console.logdomReady, loading GUI modules...         require[ GUIwindow, GUIheader, GUIcontent ]       codepre  pI guess the problem becomes pretty obvious here. emr.jsem the optimizer creates that file by only linking codees5shim.jscode and codetools.jscode into it. Is there any good way  workaround to tell that optimizer, that it also should link the codewindow.jscode, codeheader.jscode and codecontent.jscode files in this example p  pOf course the codedomReadycode plugin in this instance will get loaded and it will eventually execute the callback, but the structure itself here it seems, prevents the optimizer from doing its job.p  pstrongQuestion arestrongp  ul lipIf I just would list all modules in the Top require call, would emr.jsem also includelink all top coderequirecode and codedefinecode calls from nested and nestednested modules into the emmainappem file pli lipThey are mentioning the emincludeem option for emr.jsem in the Docs. Does it make sense here and if so, how to properly invoke it pli ul  pOf course you dont want to lose the option to lazyload modules lateron, but for this kind of dependency waiting for DOMContentLoaded, I hope there is a way to workaround that.p

Negative 7429 pGeneral web development newbie here. My background is Java but Ive been playing around a lot with Django  Bootstrap websites lately.p  pIm currently working on a fun little project but ran into an issue regarding how I want the tabs in Bootstrap to work.p  pThe context here is that a user can log a workout they have done using these Django generated forms. The days of the week are tabs across the top of the page.p  pstrongHow can I know which tab is active on the server side, so that I can properly submit the workout into the right spot in the

Negative 7429 pIve developed two air for android apps that are on the market using Adobe Air Flash Builder..p  pI just purchased a new mac laptop with Mountain Lion which is a big upgrade over my old machine. p  pThe problem is, when I loaded my old project folders into Flash Builder 4.6 on my new machine, they compile fine with no errors. p  pWhen I hit run, it begins to export the app to the Android device like normal, it then tuns the devices screen black as if the app is starting... then crashes. p  pIf I hit debug, it starts the connection countdown and never connects to the debugger. Then it turns black and crashes just as before.p  pIt doesnt give me any errors at all. I cant run it in the simulator because it has extensions that break it. p  pJust as a test, I started a new project and ran that on my phone, and it worked perfectly. So its only the old projects that wont work..p  pWhats crazy is the same exact project folder, if i put it on a USB drive, put it on my old copmuter, or my friends Macbook with Lion, export it to android to the same Android device...it works...p  pIve already tried the followingp  ul liReinstalled flashbuilder 4.6, installed 4.7 and test with thatli liDownloaded the projects off of svn, and directly from an external hardrive to see if it was svn errorli liDeleted all hidden filed within the project folders that may have had machine specific information in themli liStarted a new project under the same name, manually recreated all the folders and pasted each individual file into themli liTested it on multiple devices to see if it was just my phoneli ul  pAny help would be greatly appreciated, Im at a total loss, because the projects work on my old computer with Snow Leopard, my friends computer with Lion, but wont work on mine at allp

Negative 7429 pI read many post here about this topic, but I wasnt able to find an answer to my question, so, hope you wont be bored about another UIKeyboard post  p  pIn my view controllers implementation I added codeselfcode as an observer for the two notifications codeUIKeyboardWillShowNotificationcode and codeUIKeyboardWillHideNotificationcode, passing the selectors codekeyboardWillShowcode and codekeyboardWillHidecode to handle to notifications. As I touch a codeUITextFieldcode, the codekeyboardWillShowcode method is called but when I press a Done button which dismisses the keyboard the codekeyboardWillHidecode method is not called. p  pReally, Id like to make my codeUITextFieldcode show a keyboard with the hide button on the bottom right of the keyboard, but I wasnt able to find the right keyboard type. Maybe I need to set the textfield retuntype to ...Done. In that way I saw that return key turns to done. p  pSo I set a toolbar to be my codeUITextFieldcodes codeinputAccessoryViewcode, so now I can show a standard keyboard with a tool bar above with the Done button. As a user touches that button, I hide the keyboard with the coderesignFirstRespondercode method. p  pThe strange thing is that when I call coderesignFirstRespondercode, the codeUIKeyboardWillHideNotificationcode isnt posted at least the codekeyboardWillHidecode method is not called.p  pWhat do you suggest to me I really wanted to display a keyboard with the small button with the down arrow to hide the keyboard, but also this solution could be right, but Id like to resize the view and to do this I need to observer codeUIKeyboardWillHideNotificationcode.p  pThank you very much for help... p  pADDED p  pIn codeviewDidLoadcodep  precode[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserverself                                          selectorselectorkeyboardWillShow                                              nameUIKeyboardWillShowNotification                                            object[[self view] window]] [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserverself                                          selectorselectorkeyboardWillHide                                              nameUIKeyboardWillHideNotification                                            object[[self view] window]]     codepre  pI took these declarations from one of yours post  But the willShow works... p  pThe action of the Done button thats in the codeUIToolbarcode thats assigned to be the codeinputAccessoryViewcode of my text field isp  precodevoidkeyboardDone      [msgTextField resignFirstResponder] codepre  pCLOSED OK When a developer is stupid... it is stupid   p  pThis is my corrected willHide methodp  precodevoidkeyboardWillHideNSNotificationn      NSDictionary userInfo     CGSize keyboardSize     CGRect viewFrame       This was the bad guy  I forgot to delete it       after I previously copied the willShow method that       checks if keyboard is already shown if so returns.             if keyboardIsShown          return           userInfo  [n userInfo]     keyboardSize  [[userInfo objectForKeyUIKeyboardFrameBeginUserInfoKey] CGRectValue].size     viewFrame  [[self scrollView] frame]     viewFrame.size.height   keyboardSize.height  TABBARHEIGHT       [UIView beginAnimationsnil contextNULL]     [UIView setAnimationBeginsFromCurrentStateYES]     [UIView setAnimationDuration0.5]     [[self scrollView] setFrameviewFrame]     [UIView commitAnimations]      keyboardIsShown  NO     NSLogHIDEn  codepre  pFirst of all Id like to thank you all for this useless work in helping me.

Negative 7429 pI am creating my first web app and am trying to understand how to write a page which shows the results of a submitted form and would like some guidance on how to do this.p  pI have written a form which is working. The form runs some apis that output the results in to a database. I would like to show the values from the database in a results page. The database has a table that holds an test ID which is created when the form is submitted. I can get the ID from the database by doing a p  precodeselect maxid from test codepre  pSo if i were a user and submitted a form, I would like to be directed to the results page for that ID. So say if the test ID was 10, the url should be http  resultsid where the id is the value returned by select maxid from test. I thought about using a hidden field to grab the ID in the form so I can use this to create the url. Has anyone got any ideas on how to do this.p  pThanks  Vioillyp

Negative 7429 pAt the moment for my simple game, I have my graphics created with a default size in mind currently 2048x1024, so my backgrounds are 2048x1024 and the other graphics are made to the size needed to look good on that size background. I then, in code, workout what I scale I need for the current device. For example if the current device is 1024x512 an arbitrary res, I know to scale all graphics by 50.p  pThis has generally worked well, however as I am sure some of you have guessed by now, the problem arises with the smaller graphics on small screens. Specifically I have a font that when scaled down to work with a new xperia mini medium res but small physical dimensions, doesnt look nice.p  pSo what I want is to use the various drawable folders to provide a graphics for exception cases only. That is, I dont want to create ldpi, mdpi, hdpi etc versions of every single graphic but rather I want to use the default graphics for most and then the specific graphics for things like this font.p  pThe problem I have is because the other graphics still need to be scaled down based on this default size, these specific graphics are also being scaled down when they dont need to be.p  pDoes anyone have any advice on how I can go about resolving this Or perhaps there is a way for me to tell that the android system has selected this graphics from the mdpi folder so that I can then manually decide what I want to do with itp  pAny help very much appreciated.p

Negative 7429 pGreeting and thanks for your generosity in providing this wonderful forum,p  pIm using codejQuery Orbit Slider and Reveal Modalcode. I setup the slider to include content and within the content are hotlinks to a series of modals.p  pI cant get the first modal, in the series of modals, to open. It appears the plugin is programmatically generating inline CSS that is overriding my CSS stylesheet. Mainly codezindex selectorcode is keeping the first modal hidden or invisible. The subsequent modals in that series work as intended.p  pWhen viewed using Chrome Inspect Console shows the inconsistency please note at codefeaturedContent10code which is where the codeslide4code resides its actually a background image. The codedatarevealidslide41code is the first one in the series of modals. I did not add the inline styles its in the codereveal.jscode file. p  pUnfortunately, I dont know enough about reveal and cant find any information regarding a solution. The information I came away with is to ask for assistance on stackoverflow.com. 99.9 of the time I find solution on my own, however, Im at a lost and my client likes the features of both plugins.

Negative 7429 pI am developing clientserver application based on .NET. Server side runs on Windows XP, client side runs on Windows CE device Motorola Symbol 3100, this might be relevant.p  pClient side needs autoupdate feature, that I decided to implement on my own due to several topics prevented me from using any readytouse autoupdate solutions. My application checks for updates every time it starts, comparing files on remote site by LastModificationTime. If there are any, it downloads files from a remote server to temp dir, then it stops and runs another application that replaces updated files and runs main application. p  pFiles are being downloaded through socket, thus after file has been downloaded, my application sets LastModificationTime on every file to the value remote site had provided. I am using a time change solution from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13036165changefilecreationtimeoncompactframeworkthis topica, and it works well, i.e. file modification time is updated perfectly well, though comparison fails for some of these files. It may be relevant, that those files for which my solution fails to compare, are Motorola Symbol DLLs.p  pThe problem is that despite all my work, those Symbol files have different modifiction timestamp every time I compare them. It is always differs by 1 hour. E.g. remote site says that file time is 1242012 51308, while on my application side it is 1242012 61308. There are no problems at all with ANY other file. Those any are my application exe, my DLLs, DLLs provided by third party components like OpenNETCF, MS .NET related files and so on. Neither of them troubles me  if they are updated, this is only one time, then no updates if they were not changed really. During compare I always use ToUniversalTime so that no timezone related differencies occur and, as I mentioned, this works for other files. So I always get situation like thisp  ul liremote site provides a number of files, and there are really changed files within it my application, my DLLs, etc along with those Symbol DLLs alwaysli lifiles are downloaded and updatedli limy application runs again and checks for updates againli linow only Symbol DLLs are reported as changedli liapplication falls into an endless loop, as Symbol DLLs are always have modification time different by 1 hourli ul  pI tried to create an additional application that reads file timestamp on Symbol files, then sets it again. I thought that original Symbol files could have some wrong datetime or something. This didnt give any improvement, even when I set new time increased by 1 second during compare in update code it is again 1 hour difference.p  pFinally, I have decided to remove those Symbol files from my updates. They are not changed frequently, so I have some time to discover on this problem, yet if Motorola will roll out next update  I will fall in my problem again.p  pI dont know where the problem source lays and I would be grateful for any tip on this. I think my source is irrelevant as this problem occurs just for some files, and anyway modification time is always changed correctly I checked it on my device, in the server deployment folder from where updates are being downloaded, everywhere. May be this is timezonerelated problem, but how it affects only some files, not everyone of themp  pI will explain further. My server in its updates folder contains exactly following filesp  pFliteDevice.dllp  pfliteDLL.dllp  pOpenNETCF.dllp  pOpenNETCF.AppSettings.dllp  pOpenNETCF.Configuration.dllp  ppdt.exep  pPdtComm.dllp  pSymbol.dllp  pSymbol.xmlp  pSymbol.Audio.dllp  pSymbol.Audio.xmlp  pSymbol.Barcode2.dllp  pSymbol.Barcode2.xmlp  pSymbol.StandardForms.dllp  pSymbol.StandardForms.xmlp  pSystem.Data.OracleClient.dllp  pSystem.EnterpriseServices.dllp  pSystem.EnterpriseServices.Wrapper.dllp  pSystem.Transactions.dllp  pSystem.Web.dllp  pupdate.exep  pConsidering it is first time Im running an update, my server sends emallem of these files to client. My client pdt.exe receives them all, runs update.exe and exists so updater could replace app files with newer ones which replaces changed files emallem files in this firstrun case.p  pThen updater runs my application pdt.exe, and my application again checks its files with those on server side. And now files to update arep  pSymbol.dllp  pSymbol.xmlp  pSymbol.Audio.dllp  pSymbol.Audio.xmlp  pSymbol.Barcode2.dllp  pSymbol.Barcode2.xmlp  pSymbol.StandardForms.dllp  pSymbol.StandardForms.xmlp  pAnd again updater replaces files, and again it runs main application. And yet again the same files those Symbol. are considered as changed and downloaded and replaced. Only those, no other file exists in further update check request. Never. Something is wrong with exactly those files, not my code, nor other files.p

Negative 7429 pIve inherited a project that has a very odd quirk Id like to fix.  The project has a web form where users key in data and then click a Submit button.  Given that we have a SQL database in our office, I expected that each value would be read from the form and saved in a SQL table.p  pHowever, this is not the case.  Some values are saved in SQL, but some are not.  How are the values looked up that arent saved in SQL  Simple Answer the Javascript in the form is written so that when the user clicks submit, the markup of the entire form is sent to the server and saved in a text file.  Then, when an authorized user wants to see how the user filled out the form, the markup is retrieved from the text file and sent down the wire to the browser.p  pThis is clearly not the best way of doing this because it is wasteful of disk space and is not readily queryable.p  pThats why Im rewriting the code so that future entries in the web form will be saved entirely in SQL.p  pIn the meantime, I have tens of thousands of text files containing HTML fragments that need to be imported into SQL.  My idea is to write a utility program to parse the files, onebyone, and save the field values in SQL.p  pI wanted to ask for advice about the best way to do this.  Normally, I use jQuery to read values from HTML, but I dont know of a practical way to do this with so many files.  I also have Visual Studio 2010 at my disposal.p  pWhat tools and techniques would be best to accomplish this taskp

Negative 7429 pIts quite a topic, emblobs vs tables vs SQLem, and despite all I read so far I still cant find some proper reasoning on what to use when.p  pWe have a multitenant SaaS webapplication which we are about to move to Azure. We use an SQL Server 2008 database. We store documents and log information that belongs to the documents. Kinda like dropbox does. p  pThe forums state that you better use Azure Tables when you are considering large objects. We typically store hundreds of documents per user where the size of the documents vary from 5kb to 30mb where the vast majority will be around 1MB p  pAre there some ground rules when to go for Blobs, Tables, Sql I already learned that I shouldnt store my documents in SQL since it is too expensive. But when does it get beneficial to store the documents in Blobs and when would I be better of with tables Is there some kind of formula like p  pcodeif objects  MBobject  objectrequested gt y then blobs, else tablescodep

Negative 7429 pi need some help here.. how to create this application using matlab.. image enhancement using adaptive contrast enhancement.. this is the proposed method that i will follow..p  pThe proposed method presented here uses HE in a controlled and localized manner to stretch the details in dark images while improving overall contrast in brighter ones. It is referred to as Adaptive Contrast Enhancement ACE because of the locally adaptive effect that is produced in each frame. The proposed algorithm begins by dividing the histogram of the luminance levels into three regions  dark, mid and bright. These regions were of equal size. Each of these three regions is then processed independently using HE. The effect of HE is then toned down depending on the shape of the histogram of each region.p
Negative 7429 pI am designing a system with 30,000 objects or so and cant decide between the two either have a JSON file pre computed for each one and get data by pointing to URL of the file I think Twitter does something similar or have a PHPPerlwhatever else script that will produce JSON object on the fly when requested, from lets say database, and send it back. Is one more suited for than another I guess if it takes a long time to generate the JSON data it is better to have already done JSON files. What if generating is as quick as accessing a database Although I suppose one has a dedicated table in the database specifically for that. Data doesnt change very often so updating is not a constant thing. In that respect the data is static for all intense and purposes.p  pAnyways, any thought would be much appreciatedp  pAlexp

Negative 7429 pI am porting a library to a PCL and have to find a solution for managing HTTP request credentials. I took away concrete credentials classes like CredentialCache that is not portable and is now only using ICredentials, so client applications may create proper credentials and just send an interface reference.p  pHowever one thing still needs to be resolved. On some platforms HttpWebRequest has a neat PreAuthenticate property that takes care of initial handshaking. Without it the client needs to catch and repsponds to 401 responses. But PreAuthenticate is not a part of most of PCL profiles, and I wonder if there is any resolution to that or the client will need to implement replacement logic itself which is silly since this is a standard piece of code.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 7429 pI am trying to get my head around the changes in .NET 4.5, mainly the async features. To get my head around it I thought i would create a little app for archiving my massive photo collection. I learn best by doing so the application serves a double purpose.p  pI have read plenty MSDN articles on using async but I dont think I have a good enough understanding of it because its not working. My intention was to have each photo at a source folder copied to a destination folder based on its date taken or created if taken meta data is missing. At the same time renaming it to a standard naming convention and showing the image as it is archived in an image box. I wanted the application to keep responding during the work, which is where async comes in. Now the app purpose is unimportant, the entire point was getting my head around async.p  pWhat actually happens is the app goes unresponsive, archives all the images as intended but the image box only shows the final picture. Async is kicking off the file transfer then moving on to the next image, kicking off the transfer then moving on etc etc so i end up with hundreds of open file streams rather than it waiting for each to close.p  pAny pointers in where I am going wrong would be appreciated.

Negative 7429 pI want to make my windows based application in vb.net in 5 different languages... Japanese, Chinese, German, French and English, by default its developed in English. I have already made the whole application in English. As I am new to localizing, I am pretty much confused. And from what I understood, I have changed the forms codeLocalizablecode property to codeTruecode and then selected the languages each and translated each label and buttons text into the languages and complied each time and changed finally to default language. And the dll for each language is created in the output directory.p  pSo my doubt is the how to change the codeTextBoxcodes, because all the codeTextBoxcode values are entered by the user. So how can I make it to be entered in the selected language And the labels and buttons are all inside group boxes. So the no translation is done in the codeGroupBoxcode. If I take it outside of the codeGroupBoxcode the translation is correct according to the selection of the language.p  pCan anyone please help me to resolve this issue p  pAm I doing something wrong herep

Negative 7429 pFirst of all, Ive searched like all the forums in internet and havent found my ideal answer, SO before you mark it as duplicate question plz read the question.p  pWere creating an application which contains a simple visual studio RichTextBox. The problem is its too simple for our application and we need an advanced one So we tried some advanced components such as Telerik, DevComponents and ComponentOne enhanced RichTextBoxes, But they dont seem to be our ideal control and we REALLY need a RichTextBox which be just the same as the one Microsoft Word uses it. For example The RighToLeft capability for some languages like hebrew and arabic, creating tables, and an approperiate Paste function was some of the lacks which are in those components.p  pSo were desperately asking for your suggestion about an advanced RichTextBox component that offers just the same capabilities as the one Microsoft office uses and wed appreciate your help.p  pstrongEDIT I solved my problem by using codeEDOffice Viewer Componentcode  Anyways, by closing this Question, you just ignored what u couldnt answer. n u could just admit that u werent expert enough to answer thisstrongp

I really cannot figure this weird behaviour of my code out. p  pWhat it is supposed to do is to execute the function fixedlocation when a button is pressed in order to check if a valid address can be found and then execute some code. p  pIn order to check if it works properly I have an alert in the code which gives me the state of the Boolean that should be changed. Now I really dont get why, but it only works from the second time the button is pressed onwards.

Negative 7429 pIm practicing reusable coding so I decided to build a thumbnail scroller from scratch.p  pIm using displayinlineblock on a set of list items with in a ul. to calculate the width of the ul Im using .outerWidth I noticed a few fixes for the space displayinineblock puts in between elements however I am not sure which is the best solution.p  pThe first fix I found was to add 2px to each elements width before calculating the width of the parent element. The second fix I found was to add wordspacing 2px to the surrounding ul but this was off by about 1px.

Negative 7429 pI have a codeUIViewcode, that contains a codeUIImageViewcode for its background. The view contains a number of segments codeUIImageViewcodes, which the user can drag and drop images to. I want to add a codeCIFiltercode to the whole view, such that any images that are subsequently dropped into the view will have the filter applied instantly. But the filter shouldnt be applied to the main views background image.

Negative 7429 pI am working with nx2 matrices in Matlab, and what Im trying to do is fairly simple in principle.

Negative 7429 pIm attempting to create a page that creates a div with two paragraphs, specifically a quote and author.

Negative 7429 pI am new to ValidationAttributes.  I would like to develop a ValidationAttribute subclass MustExistAttribute that works one of two ways, depending on a runtime situation.  For example, I have a class called RECORD with a property called KEY and I want the validation test to be something like, look up this KEY in the database and see if it exists.  p  pHowever, that alone is not enough.  I also need to test another property RECORD.IsNew.  Then, if that also is true, the fact that this KEY exists is an error, but if RECORD.IsNew is false, then, validation should pass.  In other words, the attributes IsValid override needs access not only to the value that the framework automatically supplies KEY, but also to RECORD or RECORD.IsNew.  p  pIs that possiblep

I want now, if I search for 10, not only to tell me that length of 10 is code10  3 lengthcode and update the map, but also I want to update 20, 40 in case they are still False, p  pMy codep  precodeimport Data.Map as Map  solve  [Integer] gt Map Integer Bool, Integer solve xs     solve xs Map.empty     where         solve  [Integer] gt Map Integer Bool, Integer gt Map Integer Bool, Integer         solve []     table  table         solve xxs table              case Map.lookup x table of                 Nothing     gt countF x 1 xxs table                 Just     b,  gt                     case b of                         True    gt solve xs table                         False   gt WRONG solve xs table          f  Integer gt Integer         f x              x mod 2  0     x quot 2              otherwise      3  x  1          countF  Integer gt Integer gt [Integer] gt Map Integer Bool, Integer gt Map Integer Bool, Integer         countF n cnt xxs table              n  1     solve xs Map.insert x True, cnt table              otherwise  countF f n cnt  1 xxs  checkMap f n n table          checkMap  Integer gt Integer gt Map Integer Bool, Integer gt Map Integer Bool, Integer         checkMap n rez table                 case Map.lookup n table of                 Nothing gt Map.insert n False, rez table                 Just   gt table codepre  pAt the WRONG part we should update all the values like in the following examplep  precodeWe are looking for 10   10  False, 20            V                                   finally update 10 gt True, 10  1  1  1   20  False, 40                                                                                                    V                                  update 20 gt 20  True, 10  1  1   40  False, 13                                                                            V                      update 40 gt 40  True, 10  1   13  True, 10                                                    codepre  pThe problem is that I dont know if its possible to do 2 things in a function like updating a number and continue the recurence.

Negative 7429 pthis is my first time asking a question here since I cant find a solution anywhere. I am currently working on the backend of an Android application. The server uses Google Charts to generate some graphics info we need. I used this tutorial a hrefhttpwww.battlehorse.netpagetopicschartssavegooglechartsasimage.html relnofollowhttpwww.battlehorse.netpagetopicschartssavegooglechartsasimage.htmla to convert the charts into images. However this method only works when you click on buttons. I actually need to send the images to the Android app, so I introduced this to the html code p  precodesaveAsImgdocument.getElementByIdchartdiv codepre  pafter drawing the chart with the Google Chart tool. And I changed the saveAsImg function on my script to thisp  precodefunction saveAsImgchartContainer      var imgData  getImgDatachartContainer     window.location.href imgData    codepre  pNow on the side of my Android app, I make the requests to the server using httpUrlConnection. The problem is that it gets the http code but it wont catch the redirection, so it doesnt show the graphs that I need. Also I dont want to use a webView, I want to send the url with the png in code64 like I currently do so the app can just get the image.p  pPlease let me know if there is more information I can give you. Thanks. p

Im not having any luck finding anything though.p  pAdditionally, I cannot simply upload all of the files to the webserver as it is a small server with limited space.  It also seems redundant to have the same file on 2 different servers.  Plus, this is a manual process and Im not sure which files need to be accessed for all the different projects that already exist or are coming.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pAll users that will be using this feature are using IE so cross browser is not an issue.  Additionally, I am limited to ReadWrite access so turning the network drive into a webserver or some adminrelated solution is unfortunately not a viable solution to me.p
Negative 7429 pI use Rabbitmq with the Bunny gem to store messages that we want to send to customers. I have a Padrinobased web service that pushes messages to the queue and many workers that consume messages. p  pIt works fine when I use Thin as the server, but I get an execution expired message from Bunny if I start the webservice in ApachePassenger. I read theres a problem with EventMachine in Passenger, but Bunny doesnt use EventMachine, so it might be a different issue, although the behavior is very similar.p  pThe exception is execution expired, so its waiting for a message that never arrives, so I guess there can be a callback issue, although the code is very simple. Bunny opens a channel to RabbitMQ, pushes the message and closes the channel, so theres no polling and doesnt call any callbacks.p  pThe code in the service isp  precodeclient  Bunny.new client.start client.createchannel   gt throws exception, execution expired ... codepre

Negative 7429 pIm working on a photo gallery site using fancybox. The way its working now, to navigate nextprevious, the link area is tied to the position of the arrows.

Negative 7429 pI want to draw a complex chart on a canvas element.p  pThe canvas has width and height 100. The div container of the canvas has a width of 100 and height 640 pixel for mobice device 1. see belowp  pLets assume I draw a rectanglep  precodevoid rectx, y, width, height  context.rect0,0,100,640  codepre  pFor mobile device 1 I have this contextp  pwidth 480px, height 640pxp  pFor mobile device 2 I have this contextp  pwidth 1024px, height 768pxp  pWhen I switch now to mobile device 2 my context.height changes from 640px to 768px. The result is that the rectangle with a height of 640px leaves now a gap between it and the top margin of the gap 768px  640px  128px gap.p  pQuestion 1 So the canvas from itself is not able to stretch its content I do not ask for stretching the canvas itself, thats easy, I just want to stretch the content inside the canvas.p  pQuestion 2 When Question1 answers is No it can not stretch its content then How do I correctly resize its content Is there a redraw event where I can hook into when the mobile device changes from portrait to landscape view Or is it up to me to take the height of 640px as 100 and divide the content areas in my canvas into x areas and compute for example what is 40 width in pixel related to the 100 640px  This way the content would scale updown when the height of the mobile device changes.p

Negative 7429 pI am developing a webapp with jquery mobile and in an html file I have a datarel attribute of a link set to dialog. Datatransition is set to fade. The problem is, that after clicking a button which is linking to another html file Chrome says Error loading page. I found the solution for that and adding relexternal does the job, but it destroys my fade transition. Firefox seems not to have this strange behaviour and links me to the desired page without having relexternal, so the transition works. I could stay with Firefox, but Id like to test my app on different browsers. Any suggestions Many thanks in advancep

Negative 7429 pI have an element that is draggable using jQuery UIs code.draggablecode, but I want it to follow a certain path while dragging.p  pIn fact, while it is being dragged the whole layout of the page will be changing.p  pSince I have one set of styles for how the page looks like before the drag and one set of styles of how the page looks like after the drag is done, I figured using a CSS animation would make sense.p  pSo, now, my question is how can I make that animation occur as the drag is happeningp  pOr if there is another way to do this then an animation, how can I transition from one style to another as a drag is happening.p  pWhat Im trying to do is get the draggable element to drag into its place in the second styles.p

I tried my best to further optimize them but would like to see if others come up with ideas.p  h2Function 1h2  pThe first function is called 2954684 times for a total time spent inside the function of 19 secondsp  pWe basically just create views inside numpy arrays contained in data[0], according to coordinates contained in data[1]p  precodedef getsignaldata, options     data[0] contains bed, data[1] contains position     forward  0, reverse  1     start  data[1][0]  options.halfwinwidth     end  data[1][0]  options.halfwinwidth     if data[1][1]  0         normalsforward  data[0][normalsforward][startend]         normalsreverse  data[0][normalsreverse][startend]     else         normalsforward  data[0][normalsreverse][end  1start  1 1]         normalsreverse  data[0][normalsforward][end  1start  1 1]      row  normalsforward normalsforward,            normalsreverse normalsreverse,                 return row codepre  h2Function 2h2  pCalled 857 times for a total time of 13.674 seconds spent inside the functionp  psignal is a list of numpy arrays of equal length with dtype float, options is just random optionsp  pThe goal of the function is just to add up the lists of each numpy arrays to a single one, calculate the intersection of the two curves formed by the forward and reverse arrays and return the resultp  precodedef calculatesignalsignal, options      profilenormalsforward  np.zerosoptions.halfwinwidth  2, dtypef     profilenormalsreverse  np.zerosoptions.halfwinwidth  2, dtypef      here i tried np.sum over axis  0, its significantly slower than the for loop approach     for b in signal         profilenormalsforward  b[normalsforward]         profilenormalsreverse  b[normalsreverse]      count  lensignal      if options.normalize  1         print Normalizing to max counts         profilenormalsforward  maxprofilenormalsforward         profilenormalsreverse  maxprofilenormalsreverse       elif options.normalize  2         print Normalizing to number of elements         profilenormalsforward  count         profilenormalsreverse  count      intersectionsignal  np.fminprofilenormalsforward, profilenormalsreverse     intersection  np.sumintersectionsignal      results  intersection intersection,                profilenormalsforward profilenormalsforward,                profilenormalsreverse profilenormalsreverse,                     return results codepre  pAs you can see the two are very simple, but account for  60 of my execution time on a script that can run for hours  days genetic algorithm optimization, so even minor improvements are welcome p

Negative 7429 pIve got template which has header, footer, menu left side, cart right side and content at center. I select category from menu and send it via parameter to view page which overrides content from template. Then i use commandButton to add any product to cart. It works but next I select different category from menu view page updates with other products but my cart included in template does not. It remains as it was before when I was on the view page with this category. How can I overcome this problem Thanks for any solution.p  ptemplatep  precodelthtml xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtml   xmlnsuihttpxmlns.jcp.orgjsffacelets   xmlnshhttpxmlns.jcp.orgjsfhtml

Negative 7429 pI am using Google drive API. When first time my app run, user authenticate my app and after that I create a folder in root directory of the Google Drive lets say folder name is My Folder.

Negative 7429 pI have a set of integer constraints that I would like to solve. The constraints can consist of additions of variables that are greater than, less than or equal to some constant.p  pExamplep  precodeA gt 20 A lt 30 B lt 10 A  B lt 25 ... codepre  pThere will be hundreds of such simple constraints, and the constants are much larger values hundreds of thousands in practice.p  pHowever, I dont just want emaem solution to these constraints I want a strongrandomstrong solution from the solution space. That doesnt mean each solution has to have equal probability I dont think thats possible without enumerating them all but what I want is that for instance for the variable A the solution will typically not be 20 or 30, but rather that values in between are just as likely or even more likely to be picked.p  pWhat techniques would be appropriate for this kind of problem Im having trouble knowing where to look, because most algorithms focus on finding optimal or fast or minimal solutions rather than random ones.p

I use osmdroid to display maps and I need some functions like add map marker and draw a path between markers.p  pFor adding markers on map I use this instructions p  precode Global declaration ArrayListltOverlayItemgt worldoverlay  ItemizedIconOverlayltOverlayItemgt worlditems MapController citymapcontroller   this code is in function worldoverlay  new ArrayListltOverlayItemgt forint i  0 i lt States.length i      GeoPoint curgeo  new GeoPointlatitude[i], longtitude[i]     OverlayItem curitem  new OverlayItemStates[i], States[i], curgeo     worldoverlay.addcuritem   worlditems  new ItemizedIconOverlayltOverlayItemgtthis, worldoverlay, null mapView.getOverlays.addworlditems  codepre  pbut I got some strange thing. If i use this snippet in function onCreate it works fine all markers are added. If I use this code in click handler of button on main screen it doesnt work. Program continues running without any problem, but markers are not displayed. This handler is implemented because other instructions are work fine. The problem is only in displaying markers. Does someone know whats wrong p

Negative 7429 pOur team about 5 people builds web applications in a pretty chaotic way. There is one local server and one production server. Any development takes place on the local server and then is uploaded to the production server when they consider it to be done. This usually ends up nasty. Someone is redesigning templates, someone is changing core functionality and someone builds a new feature that depends on something that is influenced by changes to the core functionality  at the same time. Before people can even start working, they make sure the files they need to change are free since files are accessed directly and would get overwritten. Having people with different knowledge for each discipline, I usually need to check all changes done to ensure nothing will break regression. This is horrible and hard to collaborate. Im thinking about a way to change this messy workflow.p  pI read that Git can be used to manage collaborative web applications but I cant figure out how to set that up. Branches on local machines just wont work each coworker would need to have his own webserver, app server, database server and the same configurations. Multiple branches on the same server basically each developer has his own branch require a way to commit and merge changes at the push of a button. Is that even possible without having to do everything manuallyp  pIn the end we need a system that allows us top  ul lidevelop without concurrent dependencies separated environmentsli lireviewapprove commitsli liautomatically merge approved commitsli liautomatically distribute the latest version force pullli lirevert changes  demergeli ul  pI can imagine this working with source code where theres nothing to share but code and compiler. But web applications which rely heavily on their environment, seem to be way more difficult. But then again Maybe I do not understand the whole thing yet. p

Negative 7429 pSo Im having some problems with an SQL Query, or maybe rather deciding on if I could solve this issue faster in an PHP While loop. See I have a small table with strong4 teamsstrong, and each team will be assigned a rank based on each teams total points in GOLF,FOOTBALL and Miniature GOLF. The points in the different games 8 to the first placed team, then 642 to the other teams depending on score in each game. Then I convert the total score to a ranking number. Here is an examplep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comhZJLg.png altenter image description herep  pMY question and my problem is That I dont want two teams to share rank. As you can see teamid 3 and 2 have the same amount of total points, therefor they have rank 3 together. I want to order this table after the team with the highest value in any of the games that have been played. SO Team 2 has 8 points in one of the games, which is higher then team 3 highest score. So the rank13 should look like this insteadp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comP5v0q.png altenter image description herep  pI tried to make a query that compares two teams with the same rank12 point, but I dont know how to compare on 3 columns. Also tried to print the first table out in PHP and then alter the displayed values depending on highest value in the 3 columns, even more confusing. Am I unclear somehow Please give me a comment.p

Negative 7429 pIm using sarama a hrefhttpsgithub.comShopifysarama relnofollowhttpsgithub.comShopifysaramaa with Kafka 0.8.0 for my consumers.

Its how I control the concurrencyspeed of my consumers. p  pThe problem I have with this approach is that if I need to change the concurrency, I have to shut the consumer down and restart it channel buffer size is a command line flag. I log offsets that are processed and I have to look in my logs to figure out which offsets were processed and where I want the consumer to resume from. I want a more handsfree approach to manage these offsets. p  pIve turned autocommit.enabled to true in the consumer.properties but I dont see anything change in zookeeper. I think that is because the current Kafka protocol doesnt support the offset API a hrefhttpsissues.apache.orgjirabrowseKAFKA993 relnofollowhttpsissues.apache.orgjirabrowseKAFKA993ap  pI can try and manually store the offset in zookeeper after Im done processing a job but I dont know how thats going to work with multiple asynchronous processJob running.  This is where Kafka is supposed to store the offsets a hrefhttpscwiki.apache.orgconfluencedisplayKAFKAKafkadatastructuresinZookeeper relnofollowhttpscwiki.apache.orgconfluencedisplayKAFKAKafkadatastructuresinZookeeperap  pIs this supposed to hold a single value If thats true then that would mean I cant use asynchronous processJob as there might be latency between different processes and theyll overwrite each others value. Is the consumer supposed to run in a single thread and process a single event at a time Is the right approach to start more consumers to speed things up, instead of going the goroutines routep

I havent found a solution for this problem, ppl usually inject things with IoC container, which does not tell anything about the common interface between two modules...p  pDo you know a design pattern which solves this problem, or a de factor standard php implementationframework for thisp  pemnote IoC container is not a solution, I want to inject the dependencies with well defined interfaces, not to pull them from a DI container or service locator... I dont want my modules to know anything about how they get their dependencies...emp  pstrongeditstrongp  pI updated my question because I dont think my code was obvious for everyone. A created a class diagram to ease the understanding of itp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comuQ2KT.png altclass diagram of multiple modules in one of the environmentsp  pOkay, so this diagram contains a description of a single environment. We usually use different environments for example test, development, production, etc... Each of these environment contains different modules, for example by testing and developing we usually turn off email sending, so one of the modules contains a mock php mailer in those environments... As you see by crossmodule dependency the classes depend on contracts, not directly on each other. This way the code of the modules is loose coupled...p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comhkrub.png altdependency between the participants of contractsp  pI intend to describe this dependencies for example with annotations and inject them on an automated way somehow. This is a difficult task, because by PHP I have to load only the classes which are necessary to handle the request. For examplep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comushis.png altloading only the necessary dependenciesp  pSo I have to use lazy load somehow, for example I could inject factories, but I dont like that idea, I want to inject the dependency itself, not a factory...p  pBe aware that the contract interface does not know anything about its implementations, so I have to publish somehow those implementations by every module and find them from the other modules... Most of the DI container implementations solve that problem, but I dont want to inject factories or DI containers into my modules. I want them to depend on the contracts only and nothing else...p  pstrongMatthieu Napolistrong recommended to use just a single IoC container with different config by each of the environments, but I dont see how this would solve my problem. That DI container would instantiate every class with crossmodule dependency, so I would move the whole config of every modules into a huge main config file. Even by a simple project Id have about 20 classes languages, users, identificationfactors, useridentificationfactors, contacts, usercontacts, roles, userroles, permissions, rolepermissions, articles, comments, etc... and at least 3 modules presentation layer, business logic layer, data access layer. So that main config would contain the instantiation of at least 60 classes from different modules... That would be pretty hard to maintain and I am almost certain that it would result a lot of code repetition by configs of different environments... Yes maybe splitting the config files can reduce the pain, but I guess I wont know the advantages and drawbacks of this solution until I start to use it on a complicated project. Another problem with this approach that how should I implement the lazy load without injecting the IoC container itself into every class with crossmodule dependency I think I need proof or example code, that this approach really works well by this problem domain...p  pCurrently I am thinking on something similar than require.js does with AMD javascript modules, but that injects the IoC container as well by lazy load. You have to use the coderequiremoduleNamecode from inside the modules if you want to load a dependency which you dont want to use in your code, just in case when its really necessary. Ofc that coderequirecode is just a sugar syntax of codecontainer.getmoduleNamecode... Currently I dont see how to solve that problem. I think every of my modules should have one or more DI containers, call them module containers. Those module containers can handle the crossmodule dependencies. By lazy load the module containers would pull down the crossmodule dependencies of each class from a main container, which would automatically register every module container and every class instantiated by them. In this scenario only the module containers would know about the main container if I cannot solve lazy load without injecting a factory or a DI container or a service locator... Ofc this is the last resort, I think I can do the lazy load somehow without injecting the main container into the module containers. Or at least I can do it somehow with a sugar syntax, for examplep  precodeclass ModuleContainer      public function setCrossDomainDependencyContractDep crossDomainDependency         ...            return ContractDep      public function getCrossDomainDependency         ...       codepre  pMy purpose to use the same codeModuleContainercode instance regardless of having a codeMainContainercode. Ill check the reflection api, maybe I am able to override the codegetCrossDomainDependencycode somehow at runtime. If not then I think the only solution to inject factories or the main container... Nah but this is my solution...p  pHow would you solve this problemp

Users can also delete lines, select and delete multiple chunks at once, paste in large chunks of text, etc, all of which shifts code around.p  pI would like to track line insertions and deletions in order to know that line 100 becomes, say, line 101, then line 102, and so forth.

Also I cant copy the code of this method, since it generates a custom object codeSpecificServiceHostcode derived from codeServiceHostcode that I need, but the other part of code just needs to know that it is a codeServiceHostcode object. In case codeSpecificServiceHostcode is not available the method simply creats a regular codeServiceHostcode object.p  precodeprivate ServiceHost TryFindSpecialServiceHost    try        var dynamicType  Type.GetTypeCommon, SuperApplication.Common.HelperMethods, true      Should find public static SpecificServiceHost CreateSpecificServiceHostType serviceType, params Uri[] baseAddresses method     var createServiceHost  dynamicType.GetMethodCreateSpecificServiceHost,                                                   BindingFlags.Public  BindingFlags.Static,                                                   null,                                                   new[]  typeofType, typeofUri[] ,                                                   null     var dynamicInstance  createServiceHost.Invokenull, new object[]  typeofIMyWcfServiceContract, null       return ServiceHost dynamicInstance      catch        return new ServiceHosttypeofIMyWcfServiceContract     codepre  pNow the codecreateServiceHost.Invokecode throws an exception that codebaseAddressescode must not be codenullcode due to the implementation of codeServiceHostcode in the framework. I thought that the codeparamscode argument would allow codenullcode references. But it doesnt What should I do Thanksp

Negative 7429 pOkay, so I have a project where Im working with a Client written in Lua and a Server written in Java. Im using LuaSocket for the client and DatagramSockets for the server. The problem is when I send one string from the client in Lua, and receive it on the serverand convert the bytes to a string, it doesnt recognize the value of the string as equal to what it should beIm using .equals for evaluation. Ive printed the result and compared it to the stringeverything checked out Ive even compared the bytes using .getBytes, they even checked out. The most annoying part of this is that when I analyze the string with .startsWith it evaluates true, but nothing else works. Ive looked into the string encoding of both languages, but Im relatively new to sockets and this is beyond me.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pUpon writing some example code to demonstrate the problem, I solved it.

Negative 7429 pI am using Phonegap version 3.30 with Phonegap build and UI elements provided by Sencha Touch. The app contains a map on the first page, the map is rendered using open street map and leaflet using a sencha touch library a hrefhttpsmarket.sencha.comextensionsextuxleafletmap relnofollowhttpsmarket.sencha.comextensionsextuxleafletmapa .p  pIf I set the map not to use the geolocation option which displays your location on the map then the map renders perfectly on all platforms, however when I enable the setting to use geolocation, the map renders perfectly and overlays the current location on all platforms iOS, Android 2.0 but NOT Android 4.0.p  pIn fact on Android the map does not render at all which is similar behaviour to how it used to work with incorrect permissions. I have set the application to use the 3 location permissions via the Config.xml Phonegap geolocation plugin. Here is the link to the Config.xml a hrefhttpswww.dropbox.comsc1im3twg21mnxi6config.xml relnofollowhttpswww.dropbox.comsc1im3twg21mnxi6config.xmlap  pSo to summarise Android 4.0 only with Geolocation enabled prevents map from rendering, however the map and geolocation works on all other platforms.p  pDoes anyone know what could be causing this I have no errors being printed to the console and as far as I can the permissions are correct and as it works on Android 2.0 I am completely stumped.p  pSome pictures below demonstrating the issue, please note that Geolocation also works when the app is run on a web browser.p  pAndroid Not Loading with Geolocation Enabled img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comAeUxs.png altAndroid Not Loading with Geolocation Enalbedp  piOS Loading Correctly with Geolocation img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comjxGzD.jpg altiOS Loading Correctly with Geolocationp
Negative 7429 pIm getting started with using CordovaPhoneGap for  AndroidiPhone app development and am very confused with amount of frameworks out there.

Because if I want to put codegroup in the account dimension, I first have to calculate all the accountcode balances, and if I do so, tomorrow it could change...p

I have a few questions regarding the handling of the cache size.p  ol liHow should I go about setting a maximum size for my cache directory before I start handling the deletion of files With the newer devices a large cache isnt so much of a problem as there is quite a bit of space not limitless but a fair amount, however the older devices have quite small internal memory and therefore cache sizes are going to be more important...li liAt the moment, I store a tiles use count and last used timestamp so I know which tiles I can delete and which not to delete. This way I can see which are used and which arent, allowing me to remove the less used tiles. What happens when the Android OS decides it needs space and delete my cache Is there an Intent I can listen for that tells me which files in my applications cache were deletedli ol

And then when the user goes back to the original window with the TableView by tapping codeBackcode, the search bar is there, when it should be hidden.p  pHere is my viewp  precodeltAlloygt     ltNavigationWindow idnavWingt         ltWindow classcontainergt             ltTableView onClickdoClick idtheTable searchHiddentruegt                 ltSearchBargtltSearchBargt                 ltTableViewRow titleItem OnegtltTableViewRowgt                 ltTableViewRow titleItem TwogtltTableViewRowgt                 ltTableViewRow titleItem ThreegtltTableViewRowgt                 ltTableViewRow titleItem FourgtltTableViewRowgt                 ltTableViewRow titleItem FivegtltTableViewRowgt                 ltTableViewRow titleItem SixgtltTableViewRowgt                 ltTableViewRow titleItem SevengtltTableViewRowgt                 ltTableViewRow titleItem EightgtltTableViewRowgt                 ltTableViewRow titleItem NinegtltTableViewRowgt             ltTableViewgt         ltWindowgt     ltNavigationWindowgt ltAlloygt codepre  pAnd here is my controllerp  precodefunction doClick     var win  Ti.UI.createWindow        title Window,        backgroundColor FFF        .navWin.openWindowwin, animated true    .navWin.open codepre

Negative 7429 pIm building a simple realtime chat app to learn how to use websockets with RoR and I dont think Im understanding how channels work because theyre not doing what I expect. I can successfully send a message to my Rails app using the codedispatcher.triggercode method, and use my websocket controller to broadcast a message to all clients that subscribe to the channel. That all works fine. What does NOT work is using a channel via the codechannel.triggercode method to send a message to other clients. The websocketrails wiki says...p  blockquote   pChannel events currently happen outside of the Event Router flow. They   are meant for broadcasting events to a group of connected clients   simultaneously. If you wish to handle events with actions on the   server, trigger the event on the main dispatcher and specify which   controller action should handle it using the Event Router.p blockquote  pIf I understand this correctly, I should be able to user the codechannel.triggercode method to broadcast a message to clients connected to the channel, without the message being routed through my RoR app, but it should still reach the other connected clients. So heres my code...p  precodevar dispatcher  new WebSocketRailslocalhost3000websocket var channel  dispatcher.subscribechannelname  channel.bindchannelmessage, functiondata      alertdata.message   sendmessagebutton.clickfunction      obj  message test     channel.triggerchannelmessage, obj  codepre  pWith the code listed above, I would expect that when I click the button, it sends a channel message using codechannel.triggercode and the codechannelmessagecode binding should be executed on all clients, displaying an alert that reads test. That doesnt happen. Im using Chrome tools to inspect the websocket traffic and it shows the message being sent...p  precode[channelmessage,id113458,channelchannelname,datamessagetest,token96fd4f5163214309941f38110635f86f] codepre  p...but no message is received.

Negative 7429 pSo Ive read the documentation for the dropbox api, and its quite rough around the edges, and Im not sure that I can do this. Basically what I want to do is make my app create a folder, give the user the link so that they can give it to other users. After those users have that link, they can paste it into the app and it will let them see whats in the folder. They dont even need to be able to see it, the app just needs to be able to download files from the folder. Its kinda exactly what a shared link would do in the normal dropbox. Is this at all possible And if so, how would one go about doing thisp

In the thread I linked above they are doing something similar to this, but I dont think I fully understand what they are doing since my codeforeachcode loop isnt working.p  pSecondly, since the name column in the table isnt an input field, I dont know how to send it to this page with the rest of the information. I need to do it somehow, since I want to determine which row to edit based on the name provided. Each of the players in this SQL table has an unique player id, could I use that somehowp  pAm I maybe approaching this the wrong way Is there a more viable solutionp  pPlease tell me if you need any additional code.p  pThanks in advancep
Negative 7429 pI am processing all my paperclip images in a background process. When an attachment is added, I am uploading directly to S3 and then processing the image in a background job. I am trying to return the URL of where the image will be when paperclip finishes processing. This way, the client can poll for the image and when it appears, update the view.p  pThe issue that I have is that attachment.url will return the default url if an image has not yet been processed. I am looking for a way to get the url from paperclip where the image will be placed after processing.p  pThere is a description here of someone doing the same thing a hrefhttpnathany.comjobber relnofollowhttpnathany.comjobbera. I know I can write my own interpolation and use that to determine where it is going to be but I was hoping to just get the information from paperclip of where paperclip was going to write the image.p

Negative 7429 pIm a first year engineering student and Im working on a end of term project. Due to tight deadlines, I would like to avoid rummaging through image processing libraries. We my group mates need to find the easiest implementable method to emget an integer for the number of dark pixels from an imageem. I have read many other posts regarding image processing, but they are much more complicated than we need. Is there an easy way to do this It is important that it is easy because this is only a small part of our project and there cant be too much time committed to this.p  pAs for languages, I would prefer to use C.p  pOn a side note, any exceptional help given would be cited in our report just mention the name you want to be cited as and youll go down in history. It would also give us time to sleep. Sleep is to engineering students what cake is to fat kids. p

Negative 7429 pWe have an application that fetches data from a source and that source present the data with a timestamp in UTC.  When our application saves that data to Postgres, it stores that timestamp in a timestamp column without time zone.  The default on postgres in our shop is set to our local time, Mountain Time.  So that means, I think, that postgres assumes that timestamp is mountain time.  How can I query that column so that my result set thinks its UTC and not the local time zonep  pMore cleary stated, I need to perform some offsets on that timestamp moving it to, say EST and so the math of doing that is different if the resultset thinks its UTC than my local timep

Negative 7429 pI am using a headless, retained task fragment to download and process data, so the UI thread is not blocked, and to gracefully handle configuration changes. The basic logic came from a hrefhttpwww.androiddesignpatterns.com201304retainingobjectsacrossconfigchanges.html relnofollowherea and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8417885androidfragmentsretaininganasynctaskduringscreenrotationorconfiguratio1230364912303649herea, but, I made changes to allow working from a UI Fragment, instead of UI Activity.p  pIt works. My only issue is that, on recovery  after my app has been killed by the system  the task fragment is running when it should not be.

Negative 7429 pStrange issue while using NSMutableArray as a queue.p  pGiven a singleton object SO, a ViewController object VC, and a NSMutableArray MA. MA is being used as a queue for an ID that is received by SO, and passed to VC via putting the ID in MA and sending a notification that VC handles. There is a problem with MA losing what it holds. p  pSteps relating to issuep  ol liSeque is initiated to load a view.li liSO requests an ID from a server.li liVCs viewDidLoad completesli liSO block function receives an ID and puts it in MA, and sends a notification to VC.li liVC receives notification and retrieves ID from MA li ol  pThe first time the view loads there is no problem. However if I go out of the view and back into it repeating the steps above the size of MA in step 4 is 1, and the size of MA in step 5 is 0. I.e. MA becomes emptyp  pIm perplexed as to how MA mysteriously becomes empty between the time the notification is sent step 4, and when the notification handler is called step 5.   Ive checked that nothing outside of the VC notification handler is clearing the array.  p  pA possible clue is that there is a method called message sent in obj C parlance from viewDidLoad that if commented out the issue described doesnt happen.  Also if I put the following line after the method in viewDidLoad instead of commenting it out then the issue stops occurringp  p[[NSRunLoop currentRunLoop] runUntilDate[NSDate dateWithTimeIntervalSinceNow 0.5]]p  pIve been scratching my head on this one.  My latest thought is that there is something about NSMutableArray that I dont understand.  I thought MA was storing strong references to IDs placed in it, but if it werent then maybe thered be some strangeness.  p  pAnyone have ideasp

Negative 7429 pI have a typical business web application where the domain contains entities like accounts and users. My backend is Java, so theyre represented by POJOs. During an early iteration, every attribute of those POJOs were just strings.

For example, a codeTelephoneNumbercode class consists ofp  ul liint country calling codeli listring rest of numberli listatic char the character to prefix the country calling code in our case this is a li listatic pattern regular expression to match if phonenumber is sensicalli limethods to compare and validate telephone numbers.li ul  pThis class has advantages and disadvantagesp  ul linot good Additional object creation and conversion between stringobjectli ligood OOP and all logic regarding telephone numbers is bundled in one class high cohesion,li ligood whenever a telephone number is needed as an argument for a method or constructor, javas strict typing makes it very clear were not just dealing with a random string.li ul  pCompare the possible confusing double stringsp  precodepublic UserString name, String telephoneNumber codepre  pvs the clean OOP wayp  precodepublic UserString name, TelephoneNumber telephoneNumber codepre  pI think in this case the advantages outweight the disadvantges. My concern is now for the following two attributesp  pids like b3e9962797544276a5270e9fb49d15bb emailadressesp  pThis objects are really just a single string. It seems overkill to turn them into objects. Especially the codeuser.getMail.getMailStringcode kind of methods really bother me because I know the mailString is the only attribute of mail. However, if I dont turn them into an object, I lose some of the advantages.p  pSo strongmy questionstrong is How do you deal with this concepts in a web application Are there best practices or other concerns to take into accountp

Here is what I have so farp  precodevar array  [1,2,4,4,5]  function countBycollection, func      var object        for var i0ilt0 i        for var key in object              if funccollection[i]  object.key            object.key           else            object.key  1                            return object   alertcountByarray, functionn return Math.floorn codepre  pWhat the code intends to do is search through the collection array to see if a value there matches a key in object. If it has found a match in the collection array, increment that key value by one. If it has not found one, create a new key value. Therefore, the result that should be alerted is 42, 11, 21, 51. But it seems like my output is  [object Object]. What am I doing wrongp

What should I need for it p  pThe last part is to enable streaming video to phone and maybe in opposite direction from phone to VLC player. Also web cam capture streaming from phone to VLC and oposite Mac book to phone will be interesting solution.p  pthanks for any help p  pPLEASE If it is too long question please concentrate on answering whether it is possible to do, and whether it can be seamlessly integrated in such way that end user shouldnt have to make many hours of configuration...  Best solution form my point of viewbr  preference screen of my plugin embedded in VLC player settings   writing TCP port host maybe using current host IP in local network   on mobile side detecting and connecting via this hostport using client and it just works... p

Negative 7429 pTo give some context, I am building an app in which you take care of a virtual pet by interacting with it using button clicks.  I have one activity and three subfragments one of which is also the activity.  In my PetViewer activityfragment, I can see my pet and a button which, when pressed, should increase the progress of a progressbar in a PetStatViewer fragment.  For example, when I press the button Feed, the progress bar related to Hunger in a different fragment should be filled up an arbitrary amount.  p  pI currently seem to be running into an issue where I cant use a button in one fragment to update the progress bar in another because of a null exception.  I have tried to set up a method in the PetStatViewer fragment that attempts to recognize a button click from the PetViewer, as well as put that same method in the PetStatViewer fragment and attempt to remotely change the progress bar.

Negative 7429 pIve got a WebGL scene, and a set of parameters I can use to balance render quality versus speed. Id like to display the scene to the user in as high as I can make the quality, as long as the frame rate doesnt drop below some threshold due to this. To achieve this, I have to somehow measure current frame rate in response to changes in quality.p  pBut the scene is static as long as the user doesnt interact with it like rotating camera using the mouse. I dont want to have a loop rerendering the same scene all the time even if nothing changes. I want to stop rendering if the scene stops moving. Which means I cant simply average the time between successive frames, since I cant distinguish between the renderer being slow and the user just moving his mouse more slowly.p  pI thought about rendering the scene a number of times at start up, and judge the frame rate from this. But the complexity of the scene might change over time, due to the portion of the scene visible from the current camera position, or due to user interaction outside the canvas. So I have to adapt the quality as the scene changes complexity. Running a calibration loop after every mouse release would perhaps be an option.p  pI also thought about using the codefinishcode call instead of the codeflushcode call to accurately measure render time. But while I wait for GL to finish rendering, my application will essentially be unresponsive, in particular wont be able to queue mouse events. Since I envision the rendering to ideally take up all the time between two frames at the target threshold frame rate, that would probably be rather bad. I might get away with using codefinishcode instead of codeflushcode only on some occasions, like after a mouse release.p  pWhats the best way to achieve a desired frame rate in a WebGL application, or to measure render time on a regular basisp

Negative 7429 pIm using Ember.js with embercli and emberdata.

These subelements are also rendered as a list. p  pI fetch the data with emberdata from a REST API. After the data is received I want to fade in css opacity the list. But this does not work correctly. Sometime the transition is shown and sometimes not. Im afraid it is a timing issue. So I added Ember.run.next to my code but it didnt help.

Negative 7429 pI am creating a debian package of my Scala Play 2.3.8 application with the sbt native packager codecom.typesafe.sbt  sbtnativepackager  1.0.0code. The startscripts that are being generated use a custom user to start and stop the app which is exactly as intended. The problem is, that the installation with codedpkg i package.debcode seems to start the app directly after the installation as root user. The codevarrunneeedoapprunning.pidcode is then owned by the root user and all further stop or start attempts fail because this file cant be overwritten by the daemon user.p  pThis is my build.sbtp  precodeimport com.typesafe.sbt.SbtNativePackager. import NativePackagerKeys. import com.typesafe.sbt.packager.archetypes.ServerLoader.SystemV  name  neeedoapi  version  1.0SNAPSHOT  scalaVersion  2.11.1  maintainer in Debian  neeedoteam ltneeedoneeedo.comgt  packageSummary in Debian  neeedo api application  serverLoading in Debian  SystemV  packageDescription  neeedo api application  daemonUser in Linux  neeedoapi  daemonGroup in Linux  neeedoapi codepre  pI am running the dpkg install command also with the neeedoapp user. I dont understand why the running.pid file is created by the root user after installation. If I delete the file manually with sudo and use the startstop script afterswords everything works fine...p  pEdit Answer It seems like starting the app as rootwith dpkg is not really an issue. The running.pid file is in a directory that is owned by the app user. Therefore it can edit and delete the pid file.p  pMy application is using environment variables in its config and when you run the start script with sudo as root user you have different environment variables. This led to the fact the the app couldnt start and unfortunately no error reporting was visible I have to investigate further to see why because normally this should be reported.p

Heres where I get the value from the database function sends the query SELECT date FROM userlogin WHERE username  usernamep  precodeudate  getvalueuserlogin, date, username, SESSION[user][username] codepre  pThe value returned is the date and time but not in a datetime format. So when I try the followingp  precodedatediffudate, dateYmd, true codepre  pIt gives the error  p  blockquote   pdatediff expects parameter 1 to be DateTime, string givenp blockquote

Negative 7429 pI have to say that I am not familiar with Swing technology. I am doing test automation on a Swing application. The problem I encountered was when I ran my tests automatically overnight, the application became unresponsive after a certain period of time and then tests failed. I recorded the time in test log, the period was mostly around 6 hours.p  pThe application was still working but very slowly. There was no out of memory exception thrown. So I reckon it could be something wrong with the implementation of app using Swing. And maybe because the app keeps running so garbage collecting cannot catch upp  pI couldnt find much information by Google. Could anyone who had similar experience shed some lights on the direction to solve this issue Many thanksp

Negative 7429 pThis query below in Android Sqlite is returning multiple of the same columns. For example, it is returning meetid 3 times. The first 2 meetid are correct with the right number while the third one is empty. The same happens for my athleteid and eventid.

Negative 7429 pIm building a REST API in PHP and Im currently working on the security side of things.p  pI have read a lot about network authentication and implemented some suggested strategies.p  pIll explain what Ive done so far and where I got stuck.p  pTo prevent a hacker from knowing all users passwords if they got their hands on my database, I keep only a hashed version of the passwords in db. I use the php passwordhash function that creates a salt automatically. Also, the hashed password expires 30 minutes after logging in with the original password.p  pTo prevent sniffers from seeing the hashed password in request headers, the client sends several headers in every request a timestamp, some random string and a hashed checksum of the combination of hashtimestamprandomstringurl.p  pNow, my question is what happens when the hash token expires after 30 minutes The user now needs to send their original password to get a new token, but the server only keeps a hash of the original password. Using the checksum method wouldnt work because the server needs the original password to get the right result for hash comparison. So it has no way of knowing the user password is correct.p  pP.S. Im not worried about replay attacks at the moment, but if I were to implement security against this kind of attack, would I have to keep a history of all Nonce strings at the client side and all cNonce strings at the server sidep  pThank you.p  pEDITp  pThe documentation states that passwordhash uses bcrypt algorithm which handles the creation of a salt automatically. As for the checksum string, I hash it using the SHA256 algorithm.p

Negative 7429 pI have a public API that I created with Drupal php content management system.  I appreciate the help I got recently from someone on getting HTML to be interpreted by AngularJS.  On a different issue, I am making a http.geta hrefhttpexample.comapiv1.. relnofollowhttpexample.comapiv1..a. call in the controller and displaying the data as html data.  I am using ionic with Cordova intending to display it on a mobile device.  One of the fields is a text area and it has an image in it.  The image is a relative link.  So, that doesnt work in my app.  p  pI need to select the image tag, or the src attribute to be more specific and concatenate the domain onto that.  I am using the Drupal Views module to get the data.  So, one option is to edit the field but I dont know how easy it would be with php to find an attribute on an img tag and alter it.p  pSo, the other option is to work with it when I get it back.  Perhaps, I need an AngularJS Directive.  Can someone suggest some tips on this  Do I want an isolate scope  What kind of scope  Should I use JQuery inside the directive to select and then modify the src attribute Thanks in advance for any tips, Brucep
Negative 7429 pI have a Task class which looks like the following using Java 8 Time API.p  precodeclass Task      LocalDateTime start     LocalDateTime end     SetltStringgt actionItems  codepre  pI have two sorted first by start, then by end lists containing such Task instances, lets say codeListltTaskgt tasksList1code and codeListltTaskgt tasksList2code. I want to combine overlapping tasks by breaking the tasks if needed, and adding actionItems from other tasks which are overlapping into a single new task object. p  pFor example, assume I have a task called T1 that starts on 01012015 and ends on 01312015, which contains action items A and B. Then a user creates a new Task T2 that starts on 01152015 and ends on 02152015 and adds action item C into it. When I combine, I should get three Task objects as follows.p  ul liTask X  from 01012015 to 01152015, contains action items A, Bli liTask Y  from 01152015 to 01312015, contains items A,B and Cli liTask Z  from 01312015 to 02152015, contains item Cli ul  pTo visualize, if my task object from the two lists look like the following in a timelinep  precodegt []      []         []         [] gt     []           []         [] codepre  pThen the resulting task list would contain tasks as follows. p  precodegt [][][]  []  [][][]      [][][] codepre  pOverlapping tasks should have the actionItems combined from both of the tasks that overlap for the period in which they overlap.p  pWhat is the most efficient way to handle this At the moment Im trying out different options with a PeekableIterator, but no luck yet. Any solutions using JodaTime instead of Java 8 APIs is also welcome.p

This is determined from a few settingsp  ol liA list of duplicate check fields e.g. a Person can intersect on codeFirstNamecode, codeLastNamecode, or codeDOBcode.li liThe minimum number of fields which must be equal for two Persons to intersect e.g. if the number is 2, Person A and Person B would intersect if they have either the same codeFirstNamecode and codeLastNamecode, the same codeFirstNamecode and codeDOBcode, or the same codeLastNamecode and codeDOBcode.li ol  pWhat is the most efficient way to determine this Right now, using SQL and temp tables with codeGROUP BYcode statements is most performant, but not good enough. I tried using dictionaries and hardcoding various property checks in CLINQ, but that is even worse. Ive been looking into disjoint sets and Levenshtein distance, but that seems just as inefficient for a large list. Is this just an NP Complete problemp
Negative 7429 pMy goal is to realize circle of applications sending data to the nearest neighbor by the ring. Application MUST be client and a server together in one app. Is there any simple way to build test environment for certain project  p  pThe way i thinking now is to set up many VMware virtual machines, but I think it should be a simplier way to build test environment.p  pP.S. I have not decided what to use for application  Java, Scala, JavaScript etc.p

Negative 7429 pI am working on creating a Rails web application with background worker for performing some of the tasks on the background and on a set interval. I am using Resque gem with Redis for queuing the background jobs, and using Resquescheduler to run it on set interval for ex., every 30 seconds or so. p  pBackground job need to be enqueued only when a user visits a particular page and it should run on a schedule from there on until users move away from that page. Basically I would like to set the schedule dynamically during runtime. My application is deployed in Cloud, and the main rails app and the background workers runs as a separate process and communicating through the redis. How can I set the schedule dynamically , and from wherep  pemresqueschedule.ymlemp  precodedomyjob   every 1m   class BackgroundJob   description Runs the perform method in MyJob   queue backgroundq codepre  pstrongeminside the controlleremstrongp  precode  def index     Resque.enqueueBackgroundJob   end codepre  pstrongembackgroundjob.rbemstrongp  precodeclass BackgroundJob   queue  backgroundq    jobhelper  BackgroundHelper.new    def self.perform     jobhelper.getjobdata   end  end codepre
