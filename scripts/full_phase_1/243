Positive 243 pHow could I possible open a symbolic link and get the content of the file instead of the file it is pointing top  pBy doingp  precodewith openhomesymlink.txt, rb as f     dataf.read codepre  pIf the symbolic link points to codefoofaa.txtcode, the variable codedatacode will contain the content of codefaa.txtcode. This is a big security and file problem from my server because Im generating zip archives.p  pIf for example, a folder contains multiple symbolic links with different names to avoid duplicating files, the zip archive will contain multiple files instead of multiple symbolic linksp  pI hope to be clear enoughp  hr  pAn extra explanationp  pThe point of this is to allow downloading symlinks in a django server. The way of returning files is the following onep  precoderesponse  HttpResponse response.writedata return response codepre  pThis means that codedatacode must contain the content that the user will download. I can not just give it a path. So what I need to do is to give it a symbolic link. The problem is that reading a symbolic link makes python read the content where it is pointing to instead of its real content. In a few words, the user downloads the real file instead of the symbolic linkp  hr  pA possible solution to this would be to get the path where the symlink points to, and then generate the link in the buffer. Is this possiblep

In my repeater I need to display some properties from Vendor and some from Bucket, also some images populated by FileSystem that are linked to the vendor.

Negative 243 pI want to partially specialize an existing template that I cannot change codestdtr1hashcode for a base class and all derived classes. The reason is that Im using the curiouslyrecurring template pattern for polymorphism, and the hash function is implemented in the CRTP base class. If I only want to partially specialize for a the CRTP base class, then its easy, I can just writep  precode namespace std  namespace tr1   template lttypename Derived struct hashltCRTPBaseltDerived       sizet operatorconst CRTPBaseltDerived  base const                return base.hash           codepre  pBut this specialization doesnt match actual derived classes, only codeCRTPBaseltDerivedgtcode.

My pseudocode isp  precode namespace std  namespace tr1   template lttypename Derived struct hashlttypename boostenableifltstdtr1isbaseofltCRTPBaseltDerived, Derived,     Derivedtype      sizet operatorconst CRTPBaseltDerived  base const                return base.hash           codepre  p...but that doesnt work because the compiler cant tell that codeenableifltcondition, Derivedgttypecode is codeDerivedcode. If I could change codestdtr1hashcode, Id just add another dummy template parameter to use codeboostenableifcode, as recommended by the codeenableifcode documentation, but thats obviously not a very good solution. Is there a way around this problem Do I have to specify a custom hash template on every codeunorderedsetcode or codeunorderedmapcode I create, or fully specialize codehashcode for every derived classp

Negative 243 pI recently set up a SQL logging framework with PEAR, and everything was working fine.

Negative 243 pI need to implement finegrained access control in a Ruby on Rails app. The permissions for individual users are saved in a database table and I thought that it would be best to let the respective resource i.e. the instance of a model decide whether a certain user is allowed to read from or write to it. Making this decision in the controller each time certainly wouldnt be very DRY.br  The problem is that in order to do this, the model needs access to the current user, to call something like codecodemayreadcodecodecurrentusercode, codeattributenamecodecode. Models in general do not have access to session data, though.  p  pThere are quite some suggestions to save a reference to the current user in the current thread, e.g. in  a hrefhttpclearcove.cablog200808recipemakerequestenvironmentavailabletomodelsinrailsthis blog posta. This would certainly solve the problem.  p  pNeighboring Google results advised me to save a reference to the current user in the User class though, which I guess was thought up by someone whose application does not have to accommodate a lot of users at once. p  pLong story short, I get the feeling that my wish to access the current user i.e. session data from within a model comes from me a hrefhttplemonodor.comarchivesimagesmccarthyyouredoingitwrongs.jpgdoing it wronga.p  pCan you tell me how Im wrongp  pThanksp
Negative 243 pIve found a few related questions, like a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions150043pythonvperlPython V Perla and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions280810isperlworthitIs Perl Worth ita, but I cant seem to find anything that directly addresses this question.p  pIs there a legitimate future in Perl I work in a Perl shop right now, and I came from PHP so I see some of the advantages of an arguably lower level language when doing things on the serverlevel, but it seems to me a lot of the tasks in Perl can be performed more quickly in PHP, and SOME ARGUE subjective, not my opinion that Python does these tasks in a more explicit way thats easier to maintain. p  pstrongIs having this job on my resume ultimately going to make me less employable, especially if the language no longer growsstrongp  h3A few notesh3  ol liI love Perl, so dont think Im bashing the language. Its fun to use and we use a fairly verbose syntax that is relatively easy to maintain.li liI realize that Vaporware is a buzzword that isnt necessarily applicable to this situation, because Perl doesnt have a marketing department and theyre not promising Perl 6 by any date.li liI realize that CPAN keeps the community going, so whether Perl 6 comes out or not people continue to build modules that increase possibilities in the language, but that doesnt mean that industry shops realize this, and switch to more supported languages that keep coming out with revised versions of the language like Python and especially PHP.li ol  pstrongEDIT CLARIFICATIONstrong Cade Roux and Telemachus both brought up good points about whether or not your future can be defined by your resume.p  pTo be honest, this was brought up when one of my former employers said I dont hire anyone with Perl as their last job. Thats OLD technology. This was a PHP shop, so take all that with a grain of salt.p  pNow without defaming my former employer, shes not a tech person AT ALL, so she was really expressing an opinion of a layperson, and in this case my question was more along the lines of Is there a stigma on this particular technology placed on it by people who dont utilize it, specifically more along the lines of people who may have had past experience with similar employers. Im not asking you to look into the future with a magic glass to assume what the next hot language would be, but rather if this particular language which is accused of a hrefhttpjobfunctions.bnet.comabstract.aspxdocid282453stunted growtha, again by laypeople has negative connotations placed upon it.p  pI hope that makes a little more sense.p

Negative 243 pIm currently designing a multiclient  server application. Im using plain good old sockets because WCF or similar technology is not what I need. Let me explain it isnt the classical case of a client simply calling a service all clients can interact with each other by sending a packet to the server, which will then do some action, and possible redispatch an answer message to one or more clients. Although doable with WCF, the application will get pretty complex with hundreds of different messages.p  pFor each connected client, Im of course using asynchronous methods to send and receive bytes. Ive got the messages fully working, everythings fine. Except that for each line of code Im writing, my head just burns because of multithreading issues. Since there could be around 200 clients connected at the same time, I chose to go the fully multithreaded way each received message on a socket is immediately processed on the thread pool thread it was received, not on a single consumer thread.p  pSince each client can interact with other clients, and indirectly with shared objects on the server, I must protect almost every object that is mutable. I first went with a codeReaderWriterLockSlimcode for each resource that must be protected, but quickly noticed that there are more writes overall than reads in the server application, and switched to the wellknown codeMonitorcode to simplify the code.p  pSo far, so good. Each resource is protected, I have helper classes that I must use to get a lock and its protected resource, so I cant use an object without getting a lock. Moreover, each client has its own lock that is entered as soon as a packet is received from its socket. Its done to prevent other clients from making changes to the state of this client while it has some messages being processed, which is something that will happen frequently.p  pNow, I dont just need to protect resources from concurrent accesses. I must keep every client in sync with the server for some collections I have. One tricky part that Im currently struggling with is the followingp  ul liI have a collection of clients. Each client has its own unique ID.li liWhen a client connects, it must receive the IDs of every connected client, and each one of them must be notified of the newcomers ID.li liWhen a client disconnects, every other client must know it so that its ID is no longer valid for them.li liEvery client must always have, at a given time, the same clients collection as the server so that I can assume that everybody knows everybody. This way if Im sending a message to client 1 telling Client 2 has done something, I know that it will always be correctly interpreted Client 1 will never wonder but who is Client 2 anyway.li ul  pMy first attempt for handling the connection of a new client lets call it X was this pseudocode remember that codenewClientcode is already locked herep  precodelock clients    foreach var client in clients      lock client        client.SendnewClient with id X has connected           clients.AddnewClient   newClient.Sendthe list of other clients  codepre  pNow imagine that in the same time, another client has sent a packet that translates into a message that must be broadcasted to every connected client, the pseudocode will be something like this remember that the current client  lets call it Y  is already locked herep  precodelock clients    foreach var client in clients      lock client        client.Sendsomething          codepre  pAn obvious deadlock occurs here on one thread X is locked, the codeclientscode lock has been entered, started looping through the clients, and at one moment must get Ys lock... which is already acquired on the second thread, itself waiting for the clients collection lock to be releasedp  pThis is not the only case like this in the server application. There are other collections which must be kept in sync with the clients, some properties on a client can be changed by another one, etc. I tried other types of locks, lockfree mechanisms and a bunch of other things. Either there were obvious deadlocks when Im using too much locks for safety, or obvious race conditions otherwise. When I finally find a good middle point between the two, it usually comes with very subtle race conditions  dead locks and other multithreading issues... my head hurts very quickly since for any single line of code Im writing I have to review almost the whole application to ensure everything will behave correctly with any number of threads.p  pSo heres my final question how would you resolve this specific case, the general case, and more importantly arent I going the wrong way here I have little problems with the .NET framework, C, simple concurrency or algorithms in general. Still, Im lost here. I know I could use only one thread processing the incoming requests and everything will be fine. However, that wont scale well at all with more clients... But Im thinking more and more to go this simple way. What do you thinkp  pThanks in advance to you, StackOverflow people which have taken the time to read this huge question. I really had to explain the whole context if I want to get some help.p
Negative 243 pThanks for your attention and time.

Negative 243 pThere are already several SO questions on why there is not abstract static methodfield as such, but Im wondering about how one would go about implementing the following psuedocodep  precodeclass Animal      abstract static int getNumberOfLegs  not possible   class Chicken inherits Animal      static int getNumberOfLegs  return 2    class Dog inherits Animal      static int getNumberOfLegs  return 4  codepre  pHere is the problem Assuming that I want make sure that every class that inherits codeAnimalcode to contain codegetNumberOfLegscode method i.e. almost like an interface, except I do want the abstract class to implement several methods that are common to all child classes, hence pure interface does not work here. codegetNumberOfLegscode obviously should be a static method assuming that in a perfect world we dont have crippled chicken and dogs so codegetNumberOfLegscode is not instancedependent. p  pWithout an abstract static methodfield, one can either leave the method out from codeAnimalcode class, then there is the risk that some child class do not have that method. Or one can make codegetNumberOfLegscode an instance method, but then one would have to instantiate a class to find out how many legs that animal has  even though it is not necessary.  p  pHow do one usually go about implementing this situationp  hr  pEDIT Here how I might use this. Assume now this is ridiculous, but anyhow... that the number of legs of each animal is unique, so I might have something likep  precodeAnimal getModelAnimalint numberOfLegs     if numberOfLegs  Chicken.getNumberOfLegs return new Chicken    else if numberOfLegs  Dog.getNumberOfLegs return new Dog  codepre

Negative 243 pR has a codeqrcode function, which performs QR decomposition using either LINPACK or LAPACK in my experience, the latter is 5 faster. The main object returned is a matrix qr that contains in the upper triangular matrix R i.e. codeRqr[upper.triqr]code. So far so good. The lower triangular part of qr contains Q in compact form. One can extract Q from the qr decomposition by using codeqr.Qcode. I would like to find the inverse of codeqr.Qcode. In other word, I do have Q and R, and would like to put them in a qr object. R is trivial but Q is not. The goal is to apply to it codeqr.solvecode, which is much faster than codesolvecode on large systems.p

Negative 243 pOur client has a completely custom CMS that was built in ASP 1.1 and later upgraded to 2.0. The database has over 200 tables, and unfortunately, theres no documentation for either the ASP code or the database. The original developers are unavailable for questioning, and no one at my company is familiar with the setup.p  pThe majority of the database tables dont have timestamp columns, so its difficult to determine from inspection alone which tables are in use and which arent. Adding to the complexity of the task is that for each portal site in the CMS, custom functionality has been developed that uses individual database tables, and occasionally, stored procedures to work with data for an individual client site.p  pThe original developer working on this project is gone, and its been put on my plate unexpectedly. Im tasked with moving all of the data in the existing CMS, including data for each module and for each client site, into a DotNetNuke installation with custom modules that were developing. The estimate Ive been handed is three weeks.p  pIf anyone has attempted such a task before is this doable in three weeks Ive never attempted such a massive data migration before, and any help with strategy would be helpful.p
Negative 243 pI have never used APIs before.br I am trying to SMSenable my website. My SMS provider provides an HTTP API to send messages from my website. It works well. However, its not secure.

EAGAIN             The limit on the number of threads per process has been reached. pre  pIm seeing this in test code that starts 300 threads.  The curious thing is that I can create a test program with up to 2400 threads although I have to reduce the default stack size to avoid ENOMEM and I dont appear to hit any sort of threads per process limit, nor a WLM limit.p  pSince it doesnt appear to be the AIX threads per process limit that I am hitting, Im wondering about other AIX sources of EAGAIN, or how WLM is configured for a specific process.  Our product does have WLM support, and Im wondering if this test code accidentally configures itself as part of a WLM class, and what the mechanism to do this isp  pUpdatep  pIt appears that the EAGAIN that I am getting is some undocumented pthreadcreate error condition and not WLM, since I seep  pre  wlmcntrl q 1495054 WLM is stopped pre  pI also found that the ps command can be used to query what WLM class a process is associated with, as inp  pre  ps m o THREAD,class p 1040410     USER     PID    PPID       TID ST  CP PRI SC    WCHAN        F     TT BND COMMAND         CLASS  peeterj 1040410 2318428          A    1  60  3 f1000602d5c19bb0   200801 pts19    vbsengnsqot Unclassified ... pre  pwhich again rules out WLM as a source of the EAGAIN.p

Negative 243 pI have a REST based web service system. I need to find a way to support publishsubscribe model here. As you know REST the communication between client and server is HTTP protocol.

One typical scenario would bep  p1 Client subscribes for a change in an object GET configobjecttypeasync 2 Client does not block with this request as it is async call. 3 Server accept the subscription and waits for the event. 4 Server publishes the client with the required data as and when the event happens.p  pI basically need to know how to implement all of these four steps above.p

Negative 243 pSearch an array  I found this function below to search an array which is great for single strings, it will match an array value and or array value and matching key within an array, BUT what i really want to do is ONLY match an array where ALL the search values are metreturned. the query example could return matches for any records where there is a match for either  search1 or serach2 NOT where both search terms  search1 and serach2  are met.p  pexample arraysp  precodearray 1  key1gtsearch1,key2gtsearch2,key3gtsearch3,key4gtsearch4 array 2  key1gtsearch2,key2gtsearch1,key3gtsearch4,key4gtsearch2 array 3  key1gtsearch3,key2gtsearch2,key3gtsearch4,key4gtsearch1 array 4  key1gtsearch1,key2gtsearch3,key3gtsearch2,key4gtsearch4 codepre  pso if you ran the function for these arrays above It should ONLY match array1 as only array1 has both search and key matched.

Negative 243 pThis question arose for me while reading the a hrefhttpwww.php.netmanualenfunction.sha1.php relnofollowSha1PHP Manpageap  pIt says therep  blockquote   pIf the optional rawoutput is set to   TRUE, then the sha1 digest is instead   returned in raw binary format with a   length of 20, otherwise the returned   value is a 40character hexadecimal   number.p blockquote  pFor me intuitively a binary format is a series of logical true or false values. Commonly represented by 0 and 1.p  pIf you have 20 of them and you interpret them as number, you have a range of 220 different numbers.p  pFor a 40digit hexadecimal number this would be 1640, which is about 1,4  1042 times more than 220.p  pIf you vardump the raw output you just get garbled stuff, if you bin2hex them, you end up with such a big hexadecimal number as described above.p  pSo my interpretation of the question questions subject is definately nonsense. So what exactly is a raw binary format with a length of 20p

Negative 243 pI have recently picked up Microsoft Office Visio 2010 in the interest of drawing out the execution flow of a software application I am planning. So far I have enjoyed the program, and it has helped me significantly to figure out exactly what interactions and events I will need for the program even before I begin coding it. However, there is one gripe I have with the software, as I add new elements to the diagram, Visio tends to try to combine routes as often as possible. This can make it difficult at times to see exactly where some of the routes are pointing. For examplep  pExample 1img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comg3u50.png altExample 1  Example 2img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comdWP0C.png altExample 2p  pIn Example 1, You can see that there are three routes, each with a different label. Originally, these labels would overlap each other as well. I figured out this can be turned off in the Page Layout dialog, so its a little better than it was, but the beginnings and ends of the route are still combined. Here its not really an issue, but it could be as shown in Example 2.p  pWhats pointing where in Example 2 The line coming in from the left is pointing at the diamond on the bottom, and then there are three routes coming out the top of the diamond. This is the problem Im trying to solve. Its not shown in these examples, but putting labels on those three routes in Example 2 puts the labels all on that long stretch of vertical, which makes it impossible to tell which label corresponds to which line.p  pIs there a way to prevent the lines from overlapping like this I have fully explored the Page Setup dialog, but none of the options available there seem to allow this behavior. The only solution I was able to find online was to draw all the routes manually, but this would mean I cannot use the ReLayout Page feature, and it could be rather timeintensive if Visio decides to do it often.p  pstrongUpdatestrong While messing around with some more settings trying to find a solution to this, I came up with a great example showing just how bad this can get. Now, this is an extreme example, and if your diagrams look like this youre probably doing it wrong, but it clearly shows that it can quickly become impossible to tell what the source and destination for each line is.img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com27opw.png altExample 3p
Negative 243 pHere is an interresting question, we have 2 classes note that these are just nonsense to clarify my problemp  precodeclass Foo      public int Id  get set    class Bar      public int Id  get set     public int FooId  getset  codepre  pNow using Code First in EF 4.1, i want the following Foo has 0 or more Bars with cascade delete enabled. This is easily doable by making actual properties in the models A collection of Bar in foo but the models are also DTOs and therefore cant carry on extra properties on them e.g. if you want all the Bars for a given Foo, you need to ask the Service in a specific query.p  pIs there any way to accomplish this Currently i have a replica of Foo and Bar special for the EF where my repository translates between the replica and the actual DTO.p  pIm hoping there are better ways, if so, please teach me.p  pThanksp

Its probably not UTF8, but something else. Somewhere I read that text in .NET is usually UTF16p  pBasically, I am assigning a label that can do HTML with a value taken from the backend. That needs to be in UTF8.p  pHow do I do that in the best wayp

Negative 243 pas it isnt really popular to use Origin  XFrameOptions http header and I dont think the new CSP in Firefox would be better overhead, complicate, etc. I want to make a proposal for a new JavaScript  ECMA version.p  pBut first I publish the idea so you can say if its bad. I call it simple strongjsPolicystrongp  pEveryone who uses JavaScript has placed scripts in his html head. So why dont we use them to add our policies there to control all following scripts. examplep  precodelthtmlgt ltheadgt lttitlegtExamplelttitlegt ltscriptgt window.policy.inner  [nfunction foobar n  return barnn, foothis] ltscriptgt ltheadgt ltbodygt ltscriptgt function foobar    return bar  ltscriptgt lta href onclickfoothisgtClick Meltagt ltscriptgt alertXSS ltscriptgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pNow the browser compares the ltscripts.innerHTML and the onclick.value with the ones in the policy and so the last script element block is not executed ignored.p  pOf course it wont be useful to double all the inline code, so we use checksums instead. examplep  precodecrc32nfunction foobar n  return barnn codepre  presults 1077388790p  pAnd now the full examplep  precodeif typeof window.policy  undefined    window.policy.inner  [1077388790, 2501246156]   window.policy.url  [httpcode.jquery.comjquery.js,httptranslate.google.comtranslateaelement.jscbgoogleTranslateElementInit]   window.policy.relative  [js.js]   window.policy.report  [apixssreport.php]  codepre  pThe browser only needs to compare if the checksum of an inline script is set in the policy.inner or if the script.src URL fits to the policy.url.p  pNote The idea behind policy.relative is to allow local scripts onlyp  precodewindow.policy.url  false window.policy.relative  [js.js] codepre  pNote policy.report should be nearly the same as done with CSP sends blocked scripts and urls to an apibr  a hrefhttpsdvcs.w3.orghgcontentsecuritypolicyrawfiletipcspunofficialdraft20110315.htmlviolationreportsyntax relnofollowhttpsdvcs.w3.orghgcontentsecuritypolicyrawfiletipcspunofficialdraft20110315.htmlviolationreportsyntaxap  pImportantp  ul liThe policy cant be set twice else it throws a warning  constantli liTo think about The policy can only be set in the head else it throws a warningli liThe policy is only used to check the scripts that are part of the html source and not those that are placed onthefly. example  blockquotedocument.writeltscript srchttpcode.jquery.comjquery1.5.2.min.jsltscr  iptblockquote  You dont need a policy.url definition for httpcode.jquery.com... as the policy.inner checksum validated the complete script source. This means the source is loaded even if policy.url is set to false yes its still secure. This garantuees a simple usage of the policy. li liif one of the policies is missing there is no limitation. This means that an empty policy.relative results that all local files are allowed.

Negative 243 pIn a previous job, I found easier to manage and keep a stable prerelease branch or main, depending on setup by having each developer work on hisher own branch. We only had a single production instance, so no need to support multiple versions of the same apps. p  pThis prerelease branch is named that way because there was another branch main where wed make our staging and production releases from. The branches were setup such that only code from the prerelease branch could be merged into the release branch. These merges were our code review checkpoints. The CI builds were made from this prerelease branch as well and it was up to each developer to merge from prerelease to their own branch to migitage complex merging issues when the development for that body of work was completed.p  pIf there was a need for developers to pair up and work together one a given feature, nothing but their own branches permissions prevented them from working with others. This worked well for managing distributed teams where individuals within each team were working on separatemultiple features. p  pWith the help of frequent 12 times a week 30minute status update meetings, we as a team, would decide what would go into QA and what wouldnt for that particular QA release. p  pThis system worked, but I find a lot of resentment for developer branches when searching on this topic. There seems to be a lot of enthusiasm about gits local repository feature. Yet, it seems that they are just different ways of addressing the same problems. Not considering the crossnetwork issues that local repositories address, such as check in latency and such.p

Negative 243 pRecently Ive found one problem which I cant solve out. Ive made shopping cart price rule, which reduces price by 20 when coupon applied. Discount is applied to price of products in cart INCLUDING tax. Shipping has no tax rule. Everything is fine, customer sees notice with correct price, even orders list shows correct price. Theres only one place where I see it wrong  in Order View theres a field Items Ordered and here in Row Total it gives wrong price. Its ok with Order Totals.p  pExamplep  ul liPrice inc. tax strong159.00strong li liDiscount 20 strong31.80strong li liPrice inc. tax after discount strong127.20strong li liTax 23 strong23.79strong li lipTotal with shipping strong147.20strongpli lipRow total in Items Ordered strong121.26strong pli ul  pIve checked all the tax settings and have no idea what might be wrong and how Magento calculates this.

Negative 243 pI am new to servlets and I am trying to debug one in Eclipse Helios Service Release 2.  I started with a Maven project and imported it to Eclipse, using the m2Eclipse plugin.  I am using the Debug As  Debug on Server option with JBoss 4.0 as my server.  I can set a breakpoint and step through the code, until I need a domain name.  I have not passed the servlet a URL, and its not finding one.  I have searched in Eclipse for a place to set the URL perhaps as a parameter but I havent found anywhere for that.  The server is using localhost as host name and 8080 for the port.  Am I supposed to refresh my browser, which is pointing to a test URL httplocalhost8080sitewww.testsite.com, at some point in the debugging process  Thanks in advance for any light you can shed on this conundrum.p

Negative 243 pIm almost finished with my program, but theres one last bug that Im having problems ferreting out. The program is supposed to check about 10 scrambled words against a wordlist to see what the scrambled words are anagrams of. To do this, I alphabetized each word in the wordlist apple would become aelpp, set that as the key of a map, and made the corresponding entry the original, unalphabetized word. p  pThe program is messing up when it comes to the entries in the map. When the entry is six characters or less, the program tags a random character on the end of the string.

It will open a stream and write the received bytes to that file. If a different keyword is send the server will start listening on a different method etc..p  pSo when dealing with one server and one client everything works great. Now I want to add more clients and need them to also connect to the server. I know that several connections can be establish on the same port just like we do it with por 80 on websites... I do not know how to manage several connections. so one thing I was thinking was to leave everything as it is. if a connection is established then tell the server to start another thread listening for other connections on the same port. with this technique I will have several threads running plus I just know the basics of multrythreading. If this technique is my best option I will start implementing it. You guys out there are really knowledgeable about all this so it will be nice if someone can point me on the right direction. Or maybe I should listen on several ports. if the server is already connected on port 7777 for example then do not accept connections from that port and start listening on port 7778 for example. I mean there could be so many different ways of achieving what I need and you guys probably know the best way. I just know the basics of networking...p

Negative 243 pI am developing a form with custom painting and sizing of the non client area. I am handling all of the appropriate NC window messages and everything is working great except for a certain sequence of actions. If the form is maximized, minimized and then click the task bar to maximize again, I do not receive a WMNCCALCSIZE message. I receive the message when the form is maximized and minimized but not when maximized from the taskbar. My problem is that I am calculating the title bar rectangle when receiving the WMNCCALCSIZE message, so when I redraw after this sequence, my title bar rectangle is the size of the task bar window of the minimized form. There are several places I could put in a hack to recalculate the title bar rectangle when painting, etc, but Id prefer to find the intended method for calculating the non client area in this situation.

Is there such an example anywhere on the webp  pFurthermore I would like to know if I can use data annotations in conjunction with JQ grid addedit From what I read so far it seems that I have to define new validation rules within JQ Grid declaration and that rules that I established on the model are being ignored. Is there a way to use model rules during JQ Grid CRUD operations I was thinking along the way of making my own jquery dialog popup with appropriate partial view loaded once a row is selected and addedit button is clicked. however I cannot find JQ grid event which is raised when Add button is clicked.

Negative 243 pI have a question about RichFaces 3.3.3 TabPanel. I have worked on two projects that have used the TabPanel. On each project, I have noticed that components that are on tabs that are not visible still have their getter methods called.p  pFor example, the first tab has a datatable on in and any time requests are made from any of the strongemotheremstrong tabs including ajax requests the bean that is bound to the datatable on the first tab still has its getter called.p  pI assume this happens even though the tab is currently not rendered in the UI because the component is still in the component hierarchy  In other words, all components are children of the parent tab panel and so are processed on each request..even if they arent visible.p  pOk...if my assumption is true, then I need a way to strongemnotemstrong have data retrieval logic invoked for tabs that arent being used. Ive read the postings about lazily loading data not putting data retrieval logic in the getter because the getters may be called many times. Im doing my best to adhere to that the problem that Im seeing is that even though I have the bean that is bound to the table on tab one defined with request scope and the getter is lazily loading the data for the table, the bean gets instantiated, and the data pulled lazily, on each ajax request from emotherem tabs.p  pTheres got to be a way around this short of pulling all content out of the RichFaces TabPanel and rolling my own.p  pI tried making the bean bound to the table session scoped and caching the data that the getter returns to the table, but the problem there is that there is no lifecycle method to bind to for when the tab gets rendered again either via manually clicking the tab or programmatically selecting the tab.p  pId appreciate any suggestions.p

Negative 243 pI have a search page with which on load fills a webgrid. My issue is with paging. On load I fill the grid with Non published articles there are none in this case.

I triedp  ol liStopping all services and restarting the admin consoleli lipUpdating my web.xml in tomcatwebapps to reflect my ip addressp  pTrustedIpAddrs 127.0.0.1,192.168.223.35pli lipClearing my web history None of the above seemed to work. I dont know if you have a better solution. Your assistance will be greatly appreciated. This is the error I am getting Error Connection refused.

Negative 243 pIve never had much of a need for UserControls until recently.  The reason is too lengthy and out of scope for this thread.p  pI will say that the UserControls have to be loaded dynamically. The variable in which to load the UserControls is stored in a custom server controls property, which of course resides in ViewState.p  pMy problem, as many others developers have expressed, is that the UserControl will not retain ViewState  All the best opinions say to load the UserContol during the Init stage of the Page life cycle. But if I load the UserControl from CustomServerControls ViewState, I cannot do this in the Init phase, because ViewState has not been initialized.p  pWhat is driving me crazy is that the Asp Framwork will route events Button clicks etc. to a UserControl but it is not smart enough to load the ViewState.p  pMaybe this is simply a rant, but I wish I could find an answer for this simple questionp  pWhy cant a UserControl retain ViewState LIKE ANY OTHER WebControl when loading is required in the PageLoad phasep
Negative 243 pI recently launched an iPhone app that includes inapp purchases IAPs in the App Store.  The app and the associated IAPs were approved and cleared for sale by Apple.  The app is being downloaded and everything seems to be working as expected.p  pMy analytics service is reporting IAP events taking place but only a very small percentage of the supposed purchases are showing up in my daily Apple sales reports.p  pThe purchase event is only fired from the method that handles the StoreKit callback for transaction updatesp  precode void paymentQueueSKPaymentQueue queue updatedTransactionsNSArray transactions       for SKPaymentTransaction transaction in transactions          switch transaction.transactionState              case SKPaymentTransactionStatePurchased                 [self completeTransactiontransaction]                 break             ...                  void completeTransactionSKPaymentTransaction transaction       [MyAppDelegate completeIAPPurchaseproductId]     bool completeIAPPurchaseNSString productId        log IAP here  codepre  pThis is the only path that leads to the IAP event being logged with the analytics provider.p  pThe analytics service is reporting numerous purchase events, as well as other app events, which leads me to believe the analytics are at least reasonably correct.p  pApples daily sales reports have reported only a fraction of the number of purchases reported by the analytics about 10.p  pIve combed through the code, wiped a test device and retested everything there, and I cant find anything wrong with the app logic itself.p  pOne interesting observation is that most of the purchases reported by Apple seem to correlate to test purchases made by my team.  I cant be sure all of them do, but it does seem that purchases made by the dev team are recorded by both the analytics provider and Apple.  It seems that purchases made by users who have downloaded the app from the App Store are largely not being reported by Apple.  p  pIve tried to verify all of the app setupconfiguration details provisioning profiles have IAP enabled, correct app ID being used, etc. to ensure there is nothing different between the installs being used by the team and those being downloaded by our users.  p  pI apologize for not having a lot of code to share, but this seems to be more of a configuration issue , either with the app setup in iTunes Connect or something Im missing that distinguishes the installsdevices used by the dev team from those used by our users.p  pHas anyone experienced something similar  Im stumped as to where to look next.

Negative 243 pSo Im working with a file format. The file format contains chunks of data... So what I have is an array of Lists for the chunks. Those get added to when I add data to the class via a function.p  pNow, when I save the file, I need to insert a chunk in the beginning. Now I know this may not make sense, but I need to add that chunk which is blank BEFORE I calculate the data offsets for the data types in the chunks. If I dont, the data offsets get screwed up. After I insert that blank chunk, I then create a new byte[] array in which I copy the necessary data to, and then I overwrite the blank chunk that I inserted with the updated byte array.p  pThe main reason why I need to do this is because the datachunk that Im inserting contains offsets of the other data, so I need to create the offsets after everything has been added.p  pBasically what I have is this only simplifiedp  precode    public struct SizeIndexPair          public int Size         public int Index           public class Chunks          private Dictionaryltint, SizeIndexPairgt reserved         public ListltListltbytegt gt DataChunks          ...          public void Reserveint ID, int size, int index              SizeIndexPair sip             sip.Size  size             sip.Index  index             reserved.AddID, sip             Listltbytegt placeHolder  new Listltbytegtsize             DataChunks.Insertindex, placeHolder                   public void Registerint ID, byte[] data              SizeIndexPair sip  reserved[ID]             if sip.Size  data.Length                  throw new IndexOutOfRangeException             for int i  0 i lt data.Length i                  DataChunks[sip.Index][i]  data[i]                            codepre  pIm using Listof byte here because I might need to add extra data to an existing chunkp  pI hope Im making sense.p  pThe problem with this approach is that Im doubling the array, which is eating up more memory. Plus the process of copying the data can slow down my app quite a bit, especially since the file typically contains alot of data.p  pIs there a better approach to thisp  pOne thing that would have easily solved this is fixing the List and, instead of reservingregistering the array, I can simply access the array directly via a pointer.

Negative 243 pIs it possible to prevent the default behaviour of scrolling the document when a popstate event occurs p  pOur site uses jQuery animated scrolling and History.js, and state changes should scroll the user around to different areas of the page whether via pushstate or popstate. The trouble is the browser restores the scroll position of the previous state automatically when a popstate event occurs.p  pIve tried using a container element set to 100 width and height of the document and scrolling the content inside that container. The problem with that Ive found is it doesnt seem to be nearly as smooth as scrolling the document especially if using lots of css3 like boxshadows and gradients.p  pIve also tried storing the documents scroll position during a user initiated scroll and restoring it after the browser scrolls the page on popstate. This works fine in Firefox 12 but in Chrome 19 there is a flicker due to the page being scrolled and restored. I assume this is to do with a delay between the scroll and the scroll event being fired where the scroll position is restored.p  pFirefox scrolls the page and fires the scroll event before popstate fires and Chrome fires popstate first then scrolls the document.p  pAll the sites Ive seen that use the history API either use a solution similar to those above or just ignore the scroll position change when a user goes backforward e.g. GitHub.p  pIs it possible to prevent the document being scrolled at all on popstate eventsp

Negative 243 pIm having some trouble with lighttpd and CGI scripts in terms of how stdin is handled. Lighttpd seems to close stdin immediately after the client has issued the GET request. Previously, I was able to use thttpd to permit a http client to connect to port 80, and then be transparently redirected to a separate internal port. This let me do fun stuff with Adobe Flash and XML sockets. I should explain this more. The client can be anything, an Adobe app, some mobile app, it sends GET redirect.cgi to the server, the servers web server then hands that off to the CGI, the CGI process then has a socket connection to that client over which it can sendreceive anything it wants.  Heres an example of a simple CGI that does this using netcat as the serverp  pserver is just nc l 9999 p  precodetesttestvarwwwcgibin cat gt redirect.cgi ltltEOF  chmod 0755 redirect.cgi binsh  echo e Contenttype texthtmlrnrn  nc 127.0.0.1 9999 EOF codepre  pand now we connect to the web server and issue the GET to the cgi, then talk on both the client and server p  precode client test  nc 127.0.0.1 80 GET cgibinredirect.cgi HTTP1.0 HOST test.example.com  HTTP1.0 200 OK Contenttype texthtml  server this is the server speaking client this is is a test codepre  pAs you can see above, the clients GET request causes thttpd to execute redirect.cgi and stdin remains open, thus allowing us to keep sending data to the server until we close the client socket. In contrast, with lighttpd, I seep  precodeGET cgibinredirect.cgi HTTP1.0 HOST test.example.com  HTTP1.0 200 OK Contenttype texthtml Connection close Date Tue, 29 May 2012 113537 GMT Server lighttpd1.4.26 codepre  pWith lighttpd, the cgis stdin gets closed immediately. Is there a way I can configure lighttpd to behave differently Alternatively, is there a different type of request maybe POST or CONNECT that can be used to achieve the desired behavior I tried POST but it seems theres a fixed contentlength which wont work for me, CONNECT seems to behave the same as GET . I need lighttpd to keep the CGIs stdin open until the client has closed its socket. Any suggestions would be welcome.p  pI also tried to use modproxy.

Negative 243 pI have some problems with the deserialization of a generic list. My class implements the strongIXmlSerializablestrong interface and stores some strongMyFilterstrong objects in a strongFiltersstrong property. It contains the following codep  pWriteXmlp  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodeXmlSerializer serializer  new XmlSerializertypeofListltMyFiltergt serializer.SerializebodyWriter, Filters.ToList codepre  pReadXmlp  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodeXmlSerializer serializer  new XmlSerializertypeofListltMyFiltergt Filters  ListltMyFiltergtserializer.Deserializereader codepre  pThere are no problems with the serialization or xml structure itself. The strongMyFilterstrong class also implements the strongIXmlSerializablestrong interface. br The issue shows up when the xml is deserialized at runtime, the deserialization of some strongMyFilterstrong objects may fail when the filter relies on data which is currently not available. This is works as designed but of course kills the whole process with an exception. br br  So my question is How can I achieve skipping the strongMyFilterstrong objects throwing an exception during their deserialization br I guess I have to deserialize the collection manually, catch the exception and just go on with the next element. Is this a good approach And how can it be donep

Negative 243 pI have done some research and also some code testing with Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 to realise that in bounced emails, the headers are being removed. One of the articles I referred to was this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9104404detectingbouncedmessagesbyreturnpathheaderDetecting bounced messages by returnpath headera. p  pThe problem I have is trying retrieve custom headers from bounced email, but it seems impossible according to my research. The other solution that was mentioned in the above article was using the returnpath address. p  pHowever, when I access my web email using Microsoft Outlook Web App, and checking the email that was bounced back to my address, I was able to view the original message headers. So, is it possible to use EWS managed API to retrieve the original message headers p  pThe original message header is followsp  pre bDiagnostic information for administratorsb      Generating server MXG001.domain.com      email.that.do.not.exist.1234567890gmail.com     gmailsmtpin.l.google.com  SMTP      Original message headers      ReturnPath senderdomain.com     Received from MXG001.domain.com unknown [127.0.0.1] by IMSVA Postfix      with ESMTP id 1484C26805C  for       Wed, 29 Aug 2012 200756 1000 EST     Received from EZY106 unknown [10.32.8.141]     by MXG001.domain.com      Postfix with ESMTP id 6F7B026805B      for      email.that.do.not.exist.1234567890gmail.com Wed, 29 Aug 2012 200755      1000 EST     ReplyTo myemaildomain.com     XCustomHeader1 0E59130699974E35954EF36A069AF8B4     XCustomHeader2 1F80DCBF2F9349A490C000E79763B916     MIMEVersion 1.0     Sender domain senderdomain.com     From myemaildomain.com     To email.that.do.not.exist.1234567890gmail.com     Date Wed, 29 Aug 2012 181013 0800     Subject Test email tracking 3     ContentType texthtml charsetusascii     ContentTransferEncoding quotedprintable     MessageID 20120829100755.6F7B026805BMXG001.domain.com     XTMASMML No     XTMASProductVer IMSVA8.2.0.15206.8.0.101719146.000     XTMASResult No0.1465.03110     Ximssscandetails No0.1465.03110     XTMASUserApprovedSender No     XTMASEVersion IMSVA8.2.0.15206.8.101719146.000     XTMASEResult 100.1464005.000000     XTMASEMatchedRID wjdoQEOKyrZ7ahiNncA4hJpaQZrxtVBsqS91SjnldFIi7hIFpWx7pqbF           sETXF9u5V8fgkZZSCU19vcvk7THS8xkUATmhC45BgEdUqqANSV8bCk1I9WfnXAT8YcZkDPi         gW2j9KQ2dtSjAL46o1q6LJohGEOtW5fzCBTKbRONes9LMglhgLejw9iqfGUKR0givuLhSAhBg2       NqmDTb6QgzceqIagHXcAUO5rYRMutSnsy4xSbAVy0FQT1xloKBPsyyeoXpAAWYDGUZn3OxN             uYzUrAfNmDrdAkjVfe9KhpQKnl6nw     pre  pI use the code below to write a client to access EWS which works fine as well.

How could I go about configuring this to be fully deserializable  I have looked into the serialization tutorial on the mongodb.org but it didnt cover this scenario. I also found this a hrefhttpsjira.mongodb.orgbrowseCSHARP476 relnofollowhttpsjira.mongodb.orgbrowseCSHARP476a enhancement but it doesnt look to be implemented yet.p  pCurrently I have another class codeProductDoccode which has the same fieldproperties but they have full public read and write access and I supply a no argument constructor so mongodb driver can automapp this type without any problems, and I just convert codeProductcode objects to codeProductDoccode objects and vice versa when I need to read write to the DB. But this seems very hacky even though it is very simple.p  pUPDATEp  pIt seems that it does not matter one jot that the set accessors on my public properties are private only that the property itself is public and the lack of a noargument constructor doesnt seem to affect the deserialization process either.

Its still in development, but for the last 4 months everything has been working perfect.p  pA few days ago all of a sudden the login feature just stopped working, when you enter your credentials it just refreshes the page, regardless if youre right or wrong, and displays no error messages.p  pDoes anyone know what is wrong Or has anyone dealt with this before Is there any feature I can turn on that would display any errors if theyre were any. I have error reporting on and codeigniter is still set to development mode.p  pI would really appreciate it if someone could provide some insight to my problems.p  pP.s. Ive searched the rest of SO, found some similar problems, but no solutions.p  pAny help is appreciated.p

Negative 243 pI have a WPF application that uses a ComboBox with items populated from the server. The control works well in its current setup but has a small issue that I would like to resolve. When I click on the DropDown button to open the list of items I can only select items if the mouse is hovering over the text of that item.

Is there anyway to set focus on the current row and not just on the itemp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pThe comboBox is stored in a UserControl that derives from a class that handles network transmission between the client and the server. The XAML just creates the control and assigns a name for it while the code behind does all of the logic. In this case the server sends information to be used for the combobox and in the snippet provided below takes the XML with the text items and assigns them to the control itself. This all works well but the problem is when the client tries to select the item. Unless the mouse is directly over the text the ComboBox doesnt register.

But, i think the username can be referredor accessed from USERS table using the userID , instead of storing it in each forumIDreplies table. In this way, redundancy is reduced. p  pBut, if username is stored in each table, the search for username will be reduced , and result can be displayed faster.p  pWhich is more optimal p  pStoring names along with their IDs for faster access, or storing only the IDs to avoid reduncancy  p

Negative 243 pSo I asked this question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14883333googlechromeissuewithfixedpositionandmargintopgoogle chrome issue with fixed position and margintopa which finally got me to realize that codetopcode and codemargintopcode are not the same thing. I dont know how Ive missed that all these years.p  pAnyways that got me thinking what is the difference exactly between codemargintopcode and codetopcode, which is how I found this question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4036176csstopvsmargintopCSS Top vs Margintopa. p  pI already knew what codemargintopcode did. But I had never extrapolated that out to think hmm, this element is not in the DOM flow so what exactly is codemargintopcode pushing it away fromp  pFrom the question I asked I know that codemargintopcode behaves in very unexpected ways when applied to an element with a codefixedcode position. And that in Chrome at least this can lead to some crazy rules like codemargintop 273code.p  pSo my Question is How emdoem browsers apply codemargincode rules to elements not in the DOM flow i.e. elements with a codepositioncode value of codefixedcode or codeabsolutecode . And what about the way they are applied and rendered leads to rules, like the one described above, actually rendering the element eminsideem the viewportp

Negative 243 pDecided to take a dive into recreating a website so that its an ASP.NET MVC web application. We were originally using the Entity Framework for it, figured to still use it since it works nicely enough. When doing some reading, noticed the there is no such thing as the AppCode folder for MVC applications, and that most people were creating a class library for their needs like that. So what I ended up doing was creating my MVC application and a class library, both in the same solution, and the MVC application was referencing the class library. The class library has my EDMX Entity Data Model file in it since some of my classes reference it and I thought that it would be easiest to have it in the library to reference. So a hrefhttpimgur.comaQyqA20 relnofollowhere is a picturea to what my solution layout is. But when I build and run the website, I get an error on a page that would reference the Entity Data Model. a hrefhttpimgur.comaQyqA21 relnofollowHere is a picturea of what the error is.p  pSo I thought, what if I placed the EDMX into my models folder since the error looks like its complaining about not finding the entities. a hrefhttpimgur.comaQyqA22 relnofollowHeres a picturea of my solution now with the move. But now, Im getting a different error a hrefhttpimgur.comaQyqA23 relnofollowpicturea. Im kind of at a loss as to where to go from here. Is the way I have everything laid out and designed the proper and most efficient way to do it If not could someone give me some advicep  pThanks, its really appreciatedp

Negative 243 pLets say I have 3 machines. Call them A, B, C. I have mongo replication turned on. So assume A is primary. B and C are secondary. p  pBut now I would like to shard the database. But I believe all writes still go to A since A is primary. Is that true  Can somebody explain the need of sharding and how it increases write throughput  p  pI understand mongos will find the right shard. But the writes will have to be done on the primary. And rest other machines B, C will follow. Am I missing something.p  pI also dont understand the statement  Each shard is a replica set. The shard is incomplete unless it is also the primary.p

Negative 243 pI am currently building a website designer, and one of the core features is to be able to drag amp drop to rearrange elements. I have been working on this feature for a few days and have come unstuck a few times. The most important strongnotestrong about this drag and drop system is that the dragable element can be dropped anywhere within the strongmasterstrong container and it will emSnap  into placeem so there will be no absolutely positioned elements otherwise the element wont emSnap into placeem. p  pSo first of I started by just building the core draggable bit where you can drag the element, then when you drop the element I am using codedocument.elementFromPointcode to get the element where the cursor position is emnote I have to hide the draggable element otherwise it will return thatem.p  pNow I have the element closest to the cursor the main problem is figuring out where the draggable element needs to go relative to that element, because there are 4 options codeappend  prepend  insertBefore  insertAftercode. I have managed to get codeappend  prepend amp insertBeforecode working but its not reliable enough because all I am going is using the height and offset of the target to determine either codeappend or prependcode and I am increasing the codeYcode parameter on the codegetFromPointcode to see if I hit a different element in a short distance to determine codeinsertBeforecode. Here is the code I have so far.p  precodebox.addEventListenermouseup, function e      if dragging return     dragging  false     var thisEl  this  the dragable element       Hide      this.style.display  none  hide the element so we can get                                    document.elementFromPoint      var el  document.elementFromPointe.pageX, e.pageY,  target         elH  el.offsetHeight,  height of target         elT  el.offsetTop  offset of target      for var i  0 i lt 15 i   This is a weird part see the reference at the bottom         var newEl  document.elementFromPointe.pageX, e.pageY  i         if newEl  el              this.style.display  block             this.style.position  static             return newEl.parentNode.insertBeforethisEl, newEl                    if e.pageY lt elT  elH  2   if the pageY is less than the target offset  half of the height, thats how I am calculating prepend         el.appendChildthis         el.insertBeforethis, el.firstChild      else          el.appendChildthis  else append           this.style.display  block     this.style.position  static  Snap back in with static  codepre  pThis is just my codemouseupcode event the one that does all of the work. the other events just make the element draggable, not really important. p  pHere is a fiddle p  h1stronga hrefhttpjsfiddle.netmLX5A2 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netmLX5A2astrongh1  pSo if that did not emaskem the question then heres a short version.p  pMy dragable element needs to be able to be dropped anywhere and snap into. What is the best way to do this because the way I have done it in the fiddle is definitely not good. How can I detect where the element needs to go relative to the target on codemouseupcode.p  pReference to weird section.p  pHeres how it works  warning its not good  When I get the target element with codeelementFromPointcode I then create a loop that will loop 15 times and increment the codeYcode value that goes into the codeelementFromPointcode so basically the codeelementFromPointcode is moving down code15pxcode and if it hits a new element within that short space I am assuming that you want to insert the element before the target. p  pI am more than happy to receive answers that have nothing to do with this code as that would benefit other users too. p  pIf you think this post is long and confusing then thatt because Ive been on this for days and its screwed my head up and driving me insane.p  pI would like to note that the container that will have dragable is the main part of the designer. so It is not a choice for me to have all absolutely positioned elements and i wouldnt really be a good idea to put a element in every possible place so that i can detect where the dragable element has to go because whatever is in that container will be a quality result with no unnecessary content.p  pI would also like to note that my application strongdoes notstrong and strongwill notstrong ever support and old browsers ie strongIE6, IE7, IE8, IE9strongp
Negative 243 pI am trying to create a swipe event that will hide  show the navigation at the bottom of a mobileready page. The swipe needs to be at the bottom of the page, as if the user was swiping on the navigation itself. p  pI have a codeltnavgtcode with the codeltdiv classswipeareagtcode above it, both are fixed to the bottom of the page, and the code.swipeareacode is zindexed to be above the nav. Of course, this makes the links in the navigation unclickable. I have tried making the codeltnavgtcode swipeable, but this just drags the elements in the codeltnavgtcode on my desktop test machine when I swipe down. If I put the event on the div.swipearea, the functionality works like a charm, but no links are clickable.p  pI need to be able to click a link and be able to swipe the navigation up or down. I suggested a small tab to pull down, but the client doesnt want to use that. They want the navigation hidden by default, swipe up and navigation appears, swipe down and it disappears.p  pOf course, I need the navigation links to work too.p  pexample codep  precodeltdiv classswipeareagtltdivgt ltnavgt     ltulgt         ltligtlta hrefsomewhere.htmlgtLink1ltaltligt         ltligtlta hrefanother.htmlgtLink2ltagtltligt         ltligtlta hrefyetanother.htmlgtLink3ltagtltligt     ltulgt ltnavgt codepre

Negative 243 pI have the basic scenario on a Dojo 1.9  Dijit web applicationp  ol liRequest JSON data over the networkli liOn the the successful reply I parse the JSON data and save to the application modelli liThe UI watches the model and when theres data, it creates new Custom codedijitWidgetBasecode instances to show the data.li liEvery Custom Dijit Widget is inserted to a codedijitlayoutLayoutContainercode via codemyLayoutContainer.addChildcustomWidgetcodeli ol  pEverything works fine but I would like to improve the rendering performance. I noticed that codedijitlayoutLayoutContainercode is a codedijitContainercode and has its own addChild which uses codedojodomconstruct.placecode which changes the DOM directly. p  pSo I guess I could save some milliseconds if I add all my customWidget instances to a Document Fragment and then add it to the LayoutContainer with just one call to addChild.p  pBut codedijitContainer.addChildcode requires a widget of type codedijitWidgetBasecode so the Document Fragment approach wouldnt work.p  pHow could I achieve my goalp
Negative 243 pI am making images for my UITabBar. I am making them of size 60x60, because thats what retina screens use. However, when I use that size, it shows up too big in the bar, so you can only see part of the image. When I reduce it down to 30x30, it works, but that size is supposed to be for nonretina displays. Why does it not show up properly when I use 60x60p
Negative 243 pIm learning iphone app development and working on something that allows you to enter two words and combines them. The two words and the combined word are entered into a dictionary and that is then stored in a mutable array. There is another option that allows you to enter an entire word and if it is in the array, it will return the two separate words that make it.  My problem is that I dont know how to search an array and go through each object and sort out the answer. For example p  precode          Combined Word  snowman     Word 1  snow     Word 2  man ,          Combined Word  dirtbike     Word 1  dirt     Word 2  bike ,          Combined Word  schoolbus     Word 1  school     Word 2  bus ,          Combined Word  raindrop     Word 1  rain     Word 2  drop  codepre  pif I enter schoolbus and press the button, how do I code so that the mutable array is searched and each objects Combined Word is analyzed so that is the word entered is a value, it will return the corresponding Word 1 and Word 2.p

Negative 243 pIm currently implementing an application that makes use of multithreading but has requirements on the total memory consumption. Id like to have a master thread doing IO and several workers doing computations. p  pCurrently Im having several datastructures on the masters stack that are accessed by the workers. I use OpenMP for work distribution. As the masterworker pattern doesnt work well with OpenMP Id like to use pthreads for multithreading.p  pI know that each thread maintains a local stack, but what exactly will happening to the stack on thread creation p  pAre datastructures that lie on the masters stack accessible by the workers or should I move them to the heap  Id also like to avoid duplication of data but dont know if new threads will create a local copy of the masters stack.p  hr  pEdit found the answer myself ...p  pAfter reading into the details of the clone system call that is used by pthreads I realized that all threads share the complete virtual memory. This means that although threads use their own stack, the memory regions that are used for each stack are still shared.p  pI wrote some code to verify that behaviourp  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltpthread.hgt  void incrementvoid value          int val  int value         forint i  0 i lt 100 i                  val                  return 0   int mainint argc, char argv           int stackvar  0          pthreadt thread1, thread2         int iret1, iret2          iret1  pthreadcreate ampthread1, NULL, increment, void ampstackvar          iret2  pthreadcreate ampthread2, NULL, increment, void ampstackvar           pthreadjoin thread1, NULL          pthreadjoin thread2, NULL           printfin, stackvar          return 0  codepre  pAs output is 200 the threads manipulated the stack of their parent thread successfully. p  pI think most ressources on the internet dontt express this fact correctly.  Threads emdoem share the stack in the sense of shared memory, but the stackpointer of each thread is private. For each thread a part of the emsharedem memory is assigned as local stack.p  pThis also means that it doesnt matter if the parent thread has large data structures on the stack, as memory is never duplicated for threading.p

Negative 243 pI have a great working timesheet application. Now everything is running fine, its refactoring time Especially some views are really complicated. So I want to start using decorators for instance to clean them up.p  pAnother thing is that I use a fair amount of service objects.

Based on the result a line in a table gets a different color or other markup. p  pIt works great, but how can I refactor this to make the view simpler Can I use service objects in decoratorsp

All inheriting subtypes differ only in the implementation of a single method. In the end i will have a function that iterates over a number of varchar2  the type names, instantiates all types and calls the functions all same name, but do different things because of the different implementation. The different subtypes contain some convenience stuff and forces the developer to stick to the rules by inheriting from the supertype. So i just want to use the classic advantage of polymorphism.p  pAs PLSQL is definetly not my native language, i will appreciate any suggestion p

Negative 243 pIm just getting started on databases and could use some help. I currently have a program that handles car parking permits. You can add cars to the system, and associate a car with a permit. Up until now it was creating objects and storing them in 2 Lists Car and Permits.p  pFor example, my Car class is simply thisp  precodeclass Car     private string regNumber     private string make     private string colour     private string owner      constructor, getters, setters, ...  codepre  pThe Permit class is similar. It just has a permitID and a car registration.p  pIm now making the jump to a database instead of using Lists to store the data.p  pHowever, as far as I can tell, using a database makes both of my classes redundant. Each tuple in the Car table will contain exactly what my Car objects contained, and I can do a join query to get Car data from a given permitID.p  pIs there a need for my classes anymorep

Negative 243 pProcessors these days are mostly 32 or 64 bit. This means that the instructions they process have this size. p  pWe often hear that a 32bit operating system is limited to 4GB232 bits of RAM due to the fact that the length of a RAM address needs to hold inside 32 bits. p  pBut in fact, when we look at how instructions look, you often have way less than 32 bits to load a word. p  pLets take the x86 codemovcode instruction, you have an opcode, a source and a destination address.p  pMy question is, how can we possibly load something from a 32 bit long addressp  pDo we always need to have a pointer to that address in a place in memory that has a smaller address that can be used in an instructionp  pThanks p

I have used threads so that multiple clients can send messages concurrently, but I havent applied threadsafety yet.p  pLets come to the problem. for the first time when a client sends String to server, server prints it well, add to its arraylist, then broadcasts it to all clients and all clients can see that too. But next time when client sends String message, server accepts it, adds to arraylist and broadcasts it, but this time all clients gets old arraylist  list with only one String which was added first . I have printed arraylist before broadcasting and it shows modified values, but at client side it shows list with one entry only.p  pPart of Server codep  precodepublic class ServerGUI extends javax.swing.JFrame   public static final int SERVERPORT  4000 private ServerSocket ss ArrayListltStringgt al ArrayListltClientHandlergt clients  public ServerGUI      initComponents     setVisibletrue     al  new ArrayListltgt     clients  new ArrayListltgt     initNet   private void initNet      Socket ds  null     try          ss  new ServerSocketSERVERPORT, 1         while true               ds  ss.accept              clients.addnew ClientHandlerds               catch Exception e           System.out.printlnshutting down server......        class ClientHandler extends Thread       private Socket ds     private ObjectOutputStream out     private ObjectInputStream in      public ClientHandlerSocket ds throws Exception          this.ds  ds         out  new ObjectOutputStreamds.getOutputStream         in  new ObjectInputStreamds.getInputStream         start           public ObjectOutputStream getOut          return out           public void run          try              while true                  acceptDatain                 broadcastData                       catch Exception e              e.printStackTrace          finally              System.out.printlnFinally called. socket closed             if ds  null                  try                      ds.close                  catch IOException e                      e.printStackTrace                                               private void acceptDataObjectInputStream in throws Exception      System.out.printlnacceptData called by   Thread.currentThread.getName     String s  String in.readObject     al.adds     jta.setTextal.toString   private void broadcastData throws Exception      System.out.printlnbroadcast called by   Thread.currentThread.getName     System.out.printlnal is  n  al      for ClientHandler clnt  clients          clnt.getOut.writeObjectal         clnt.getOut.flush       codepre  pPart of Client codep  precodepublic class ClientGUI extends javax.swing.JFrame   public static final int SERVERPORT  4000 public static final String SERVERIP  127.0.0.1 private Socket s1 private ObjectOutputStream out private ObjectInputStream in private ArrayListltStringgt al  public ClientGUI      initComponents     setVisibletrue     initNet   private void initNet      try          s1  new SocketSERVERIP, SERVERPORT         out  new ObjectOutputStreams1.getOutputStream                     in  new ObjectInputStreams1.getInputStream         System.out.printlnconnected to server          new ReadData       catch Exception e          e.printStackTrace        class ReadData extends Thread       public ReadData          start           public void run          System.out.printlnclient thread started         try              while true                  al  ArrayListltStringgt in.readObject                 System.out.printlnclient read completed, al is al                  jta.setTextal.toString                                           catch Exception e              e.printStackTrace                private void textFieldActionPerformedjava.awt.event.ActionEvent evt                                          try          out.writeObjectjtf.getText         out.flush      catch Exception e          e.printStackTrace       codepre

Negative 243 pIm in the process of migrating a 2010 RoR app to Sails.js. From the face of it Sails.js looks like the best framework for migrating the app to Node.js platform. In the process, I came across a limitation  it seems like sails only caters to a development environment through local.js and a production environment. p  pUnder RoR, I had a environments folder under config, which contained dev, test, staging, production, etc. ruby files that contained constants, logging levels, etc. defined for that environment. I am looking for an example of the same structure under Sails.js.p  pThanks,p  pKp

Negative 243 pAs far as I understand atomic operation are one that are indivisible that is one thread can see the state of a system before thread 2 changes it or after the change made by thread 2 but not in between. p  psay for example I have a method on a shared object betwwen 2 threadsp  precodepublic void incrementMe    incrementing a shared int for this example  atomicInt.incrementAndGet  codepre  pthat for example that the initial value of our atomic int is 5. Now thread 1 and thread 2 are both calling incrementMe at the same time. what will happen as far as I understand thread 1 will see the value 5 and increment it to 6 at the same time thread 2 will see the value 5 since the increment is atomic so thread 2 can see the value after change of after but no in between so it increment it to 6 and at the end I will have the value 6 instead of 7.

Note I am using jQuery code.eachcode among other things that might make this slower but I just want the logic to work first.p  pSo, short story  I have items that a user can select, When they select an item, I put it into an array list called codematerialscode. This array list houses everything the user has selected and all of the items subitems.  heres and example If the user selects Wood Barricade and Sleeping Bag it will add to the codematerialscode array and output like sop  precode[woodBarricade1, wood30, sleepingBag1, cloth15] codepre  pNow, if the user adds in Wood Planks, the array becomesp  precode[woodBarricade1, wood30, sleepingBag1, cloth15, woodPlanks1, wood10] codepre  pWhat I am trying to do now is combine like selections.  In the example above, It should combine the two wood items and the new array should sayp  precode[woodBarricade1, wood40, sleepingBag1, cloth15, woodPlanks1] codepre  pHeres what I have so farp  precodefunction calculateMaterials Start the function     var conMaterialList  [] Empty the list every time.     .eachmaterials, functiona for each material in the list         var materialName  materials[a].split[0] Get its name         var materialCount  parseIntmaterials[a].split[1]  And the quantity         ifconMaterialList    Then if the conMaterialList is empty             conMaterialList.pushmaterialNamematerialCount Add the first material          else    If the conMaterialList is NOT empty             .eachconMaterialList, functionb iterate through the list                 var materialNameComp  conMaterialList[b].split[0] Get the name                 var materialCountComp  parseIntconMaterialList[b].split[1] Get the quantity                 ifmaterialName  materialNameComp  If the item from materials matches an item from conMaterialList                     conMaterialList.spliceb, 1, materialNameComp  parseIntmaterialCount  materialCountComp combine that material                  else    If it does not match                     conMaterialList.pushmaterialName  materialCount push that material into the array                                                 console.logconMaterialList Show me the conMaterialList  codepre  pThis ALMOST works.  If I were to try this with the example above Select Wood barricade, sleeping bag and wood plank I would get this as the outputp  precode[woodBarricade1, wood40, sleepingBag1, sleepingBag1, cloth15, cloth15, cloth15, cloth15, woodPlanks1, woodPlanks1, woodPlanks1, woodPlanks1, woodPlanks1, woodPlanks1, woodPlanks1, woodPlanks1, wood10, wood10, wood10, wood10, wood10, wood10, wood10, wood10, wood10, wood10, wood10, wood10, wood10, wood10, wood10] codepre  pAs you can see, the first wood has a quantity of 40.  This technically did Add the two wood piles together.  But what happened after that is a mystery to me at the moment.  p  pIve already been told that Im doing this the slowest way possible, but I would like the logic to work first before I speed it up.  p  pAny ideas on how to combine items and make a single, succinct listp

Negative 243 pI am currently using Ionic Framework as my javascript framework for my PhoneGap app.p  pI have an item on one of my pages that I want to be expandable and collapsible when I click an anchor on the page.

In other words, when I click on the ExpandCollapse test anchor, the anchor with the text child in it shows and hides accordingly. The problem comes when I send it to adobe build and load it as an app on my phone. Once I do this, it works inconsistently no matter how slow I press on the anchor. It works if I scroll around the page before clicking on the ExpandCollapse Test anchor each time, but if I just keep the page static without scrolling, and click on the ExpandCollapse test anchor, it doesnt show or hide the child anchor until I click somewhere else on the screen.p  pAny ideas I really dont want to implement jquery onclick listeners if I dont have to.p  pThanksp

Negative 243 pI have a bunch of Eclipsebased plugins that I have been migrating to MavenTycho. Most of these plugins depend on separate libraries that I now manage through Maven, rather than muddle around with code.jarcode files.p  pThe most cumbersome part of my current setup is due to the apparent inability of Tycho to process Mavenonly i.e. nonOSGi artifacts. My current setup works like thisp  ol lipIn the codepom.xmlcode of each Eclipse plugin I issue an codeunpackcode goal to codemavendependencyplugincode during the codeinitializecode phase. This unpacks the artifacts that I specify to a separate codetargetdependenciescode directory.pli lipThe codetargetdependenciescode directory is added as an output directory in codebuild.propertiescode, so that Tycho can add it to the classpath when compilingp  precodesource..  srcmainjava output..  targetclasses output..  targetdependencies codepreli lipThe codetargetdependenciescode directory is added to the codeBundleClassPathcode library in codeMETAINFMANIFEST.MFcode.pli ol  pThese settings allow the codecompilecode Maven directive to compile the plugin. Importing the project from VCS and manually specifying the codetargetdependenciescode directory as a class folder in Eclipse allows said IDE to also compile the plugin.p  pUnfortunately this is a rather cumbersome solution for a few reasonsp  ul lipConfiguring the codemavendependencyplugincode requires listing all artifacts that should be unpacked. One emcouldem use codeunpackdependenciescode instead of codeunpackcode, but that would also unpack all OSGi dependencies  having half of Eclipse unpacked in each project directory is not my idea of fun...pli lipAdding the class folder in Eclipse requires Maven codeinitializecode to be run once, so that the codetargetdependenciescode directory is created.pli lipThere is no source connection between the pure Maven projects and their depending Tycho projects in Eclipse. For a change to propagate from a Maven project to an Tycho project, so that e.g. Eclipse may show a potential compilation problem, one has to codemvn installcode the Maven project and then run codemvn clean initializecode in the Tycho project to remove the previously unpacked dependencies and pull in the current set. Then you have to refresh the Eclipse project and hope that Eclipse does the right thing.p  pIn the same vein, viewing the source of a dependency from a Tycho project will emnotem show the primary source file, but rather whatever is available in codetargetdependenciescode  quite possibly just a code.classcode file.pli ul  pI am thinking that there must be a more reasonable way to go about this  something that would allow Eclipse and Maven projects to integrate more tightly.p  pSo, what am I missing What is the recommended setup for this use case Is there a better alternative Preferably something that would not require setting a bunch of Nexus andor p2 repositoriesp

Negative 243 pIm trying to see if it is possible to extract from a pdf file the bibliography if it exists contained in it maybe in a .bib file format. I saw programs like a hrefhttpwww.mendeley.com relnofollowmendeleya  or a hrefhttpwww.molspaces.comdcb2biboverview.php relnofollowcb2Biba, but it seems to me that they only extract the bibliographical reference of the article itself but not the references contained in the article.

Negative 243 pThe simplest way to write specs checking that a controller is authorizing the signedin currentuser to use the said action is to explicitly write two specs checking that a user with permission can run that action, and another cannot. For examplep  precode  The controller action   def someaction    authorize dothisaction, someobject  end    The spec   it should work when authorized do    signin user    get someaction    response.should besuccess  end   it should not work when not authorized do    signin otheruser    get someaction    response.shouldnot besuccess  end codepre  pBut this is not great, as it requires a great amount of code two or more specs and doesnt actually test directly that the authorization is being checked codedothisactioncode in the example.p  pI would like to be able to write a simpler spec, e.g. an example using rr for mockingp  precode it should check the user can dothisaction do    mockcontroller.authorizedothisaction, someobject    get someaction  end codepre  pI think this would be shorter and directly test that the authorization check I want to be used is being run. But, I cant figure out how to write the mock. codemockcontrollercode isnt correct, nor does mocking codeApplicationControllercode or codeAbilitycode seem to work.p  pHow do I write this kind of mockp

Negative 243 pIf I recall correctly, in the good old C days MSDN used to be helpful in that it would show you not only the header file you needed to include to access a particular function, but also the DLL you needed to link to where that functionality was implemented.

Negative 243 pI have a master view model that contains various other view models, including lists of other view models. I can preserve the state of the master view model by using lots of codeHtml.HiddenForcode statements in views, however this seems untidy, especially when doing so basically reconstructs each member field with the view model. Is there a better way or is this the most common methodp  pIt would be great if a catch all codeHtml.HiddenFormodel gt model.viewModelcode automatically included all members.p
Negative 243 pI have asked a few questions before, however I have decided to go back to basics.p  pI am creating a maths android application, each page has three codeTextFieldcodes that the user can input a number into, I have parsed these codeTextFieldcodes into a double. However, say a user inputs a number into 2 of the codeTextFieldcodes, I would like the program to tell me the value of the third Text field.p  pAt the moment I can get the program to run one calculation, however when I add the if statements in for the remaining two codeTextFieldcodes, the program crashes when I click calculate. The Key behind the program is to discover which codeTextFieldcode is empty, so that the program can do the correct calculation. p  pI am currently trying code.getText.toString.isEmptycode, but this is not working, I have also tried .length  0, however this is not working either.p  pWhen I run the emulator and click the calculator button, the program crashes when I add more variables in, however it is fine with just one calculation.p  pCan anyone help me figure out why the If statements are not working, and if possible can anyone offer a solution p  pSorry if my formatting is off, Im relatively new to Java, below is the Java p  precodeButton calc1  Button findViewByIdR.id.currentcalculate      calc1.setOnClickListenernew View.OnClickListener           public void onClickView v               EditText Charge1  EditText findViewByIdR.id.numberinput2             EditText Time1  EditText findViewByIdR.id.numberinput3             EditText current1  EditText findViewByIdR.id.numberinput1             TextView Distancesanswer  TextView findViewByIdR.id.Distancesanswer             double charge  Double                     .parseDoubleCharge1.getText.toString             double time  Double.parseDoubleTime1.getText.toString             double current  Double.parseDoublecurrent1.getText                     .toString              Time is a class in Java             if current1.getText.toString.isEmpty                  Distancesanswer.setText  charge  time               else if Time1.length  0                   Distancesanswer.setText   charge  current                             codepre  pI have also supplied the XML in case it is needed  p  precodeltRelativeLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid xmlnstoolshttpschemas.android.comtools androidididRelativeLayout1 androidlayoutwidthmatchparent androidlayoutheightmatchparent androidbackgrounddrawablebackground1 androidgravityfill androidorientationvertical androidtextColorffffff toolscontext.CurrentPage gt  ltTextView     androidididCurrenthint     androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent     androidlayoutheightwrapcontent     androidlayoutmargin20dp     androidlayoutmarginTop33dp     androidtextWelcome to the Current Calculation page.

Negative 243 pI am currently building an image processing app for Android using OpenGL ES 2.0 and I was wondering about the use of shader programs in the app.p  pI am not sure if there is a max limit of shader programs was not able to turn up anything with google that can be loaded at once, but at this current time I am looking at between 10 and 20 shader programs within the app. The app is not a game, is for graphical editing of an image. I imagine a game would use a lot more shades than that so I am not sure if this is too much overhead for the app or if it means that I am currently wasting time optimizing code that does not need to be optimized. p  pThe unfortunate thing is that Id only ever need to use anywhere between 26 of these shaders at any one time. I had originaly tried to design the code so itll only load the shader programs that it needs at that specific time and delete the ones it does not, but so far it appears that I can not load a shader program on the click of a button.p  blockquote   pShader calls should be within a GL thread that is onSurfaceChanged, onSurfaceCreated or onDrawFramep blockquote  pThe glCreateShader method returns 0 when I try to create a shader outside any of the above methods on button click. I have tried calling it within a queueEvent which in theory should put it on the GL thread but it still returns 0.p  pSo am I right in thinking at the moment that I need to load all 1020 shader programs when I create my GL Surface or put them in my draw method with other ifs around it to determine if any shader programs do need to be loaded. Is there anything wrong with doing that even though Ill only use very few of them at oncep

Negative 243 pI am building a Node app that talks to an Xbee over serial and readscontrols several sensorsrelays that are also Xbee equipped. I would like to use Meteor for the user interface and data storage with the Node app simply sending sensor updates and controlling the relays when triggered by the Meteor app. What would be the proper way to communicate between the Node and Meteor app I know I can use a Node DDP client to insert sensor readings to the Meteor app. The part I am having problems with is sending commands from Meteor to the Node app to control the relays. I simply need to send a command that will execute certain code on the Node app to switch the relays. Maybe this is a simple question, but Im not sure of the best way to accomplish this. Thanks in advance for any input.p

Original file data will be printed to stdout and the data being scanned for to stderr.  The kqueues appear to be monitoring the log just fine, returning the correct number of bytes per change.

Once I am authenticated, i am brought to the splash screen splash also as expected. However, if I log in using the user credentials, I should be restricted from the inventory path. No matter what I try inventory, inventory, inventory, etc I cannot get the resource to be restricted. I have tested this configuration out on an application that accesses HTML pages directly from the application directory and it seems to work fine, thus I am convinced that it has something to do with the AngularJS controller routing the requests and using that hash mark.p  pAnother point of interest I discovered in researching this was that because we are using templates from multiple sources to compile each page we cannot use the locationProvider to set HTML5 mode without breaking the application.p  pIf anyone has any insight into this problem, it would be greatly appreciated. I am sure this has been somewhere, but for the life of me I could not find anything. Thank youp

Negative 243 pThis happens a lot I have a lot of controls laid out, and I decide Id like to put them into a panel for whatever reason  maybe to make it easier to disable them all at once without affecting other controls, or to isolate some radio buttons, etc.p  pI find it a cumbersome operation to add a codeSystem.Windows.Forms.Panelcode beneath my controls.  This usually involves resizing my parent control or form so I can add the panel in a temporary space adjacent to the collection of controls that will soon occupy the panel, then dragging the controls onto the panel, then setting the parent controlform size back to what it was before.  p  pOften I have anchors set in various ways on various controls so that simply resizing the parent doesnt happen without the carefullytweaked layout of the controls getting all messed up.  p  pThis is obviously a tedious process for what should be such a simple operation.  Is there a VS trick to doing this other than editing the designergenerated file by hand, which would mean Id have to handpick the controls by name that I want to reparentp

Downregulation of hSP56 in LNCaP cells that normally express hSP56 results in enhanced anchorageindependent growth. PC3 cells expressing hSP56 exhibit a significant reduction of hypoxia inducible protein HIF1 protein levels under hypoxic conditions without altering HIF1 mRNA HIF1A levels. Taken together, our findings strongly suggest that hSP56 plays a critical role in prostate cells by mechanisms including negative regulation of HIF1, thus identifying hSP56 as a candidate antioncogene product.                     ltAbstractTextgt                 ltAbstractgt                 ltAuthorListgt                     ltAuthorgt                         ltLastNamegtJeongltLastNamegt                         ltForeNamegtJeeYeongltForeNamegt                         ltInitialsgtJYltInitialsgt                         ltAffiliationgt                             Laboratory for Cell and Molecular Biology, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA Department of Biochemistry and Cancer Research Institute, Kosin University College of Medicine, Busan, South Korea.                         ltAffiliationgt                     ltAuthorgt                     ltAuthorgt                         ltLastNamegtZhoultLastNamegt                         ltForeNamegtJinRongltForeNamegt                         ltInitialsgtJRltInitialsgt                     ltAuthorgt                     ltAuthorgt                         ltLastNamegtGaoltLastNamegt                         ltForeNamegtChongltForeNamegt                         ltInitialsgtCltInitialsgt                     ltAuthorgt                     ltAuthorgt                         ltLastNamegtFeldmanltLastNamegt                         ltForeNamegtLaurieltForeNamegt                         ltInitialsgtLltInitialsgt                     ltAuthorgt                     ltAuthorgt                         ltLastNamegtSytkowskiltLastNamegt                         ltForeNamegtArthur JltForeNamegt                         ltInitialsgtAJltInitialsgt                     ltAuthorgt                 ltAuthorListgt                 ltLanguagegtENGltLanguagegt                 ltPublicationTypeListgt                     ltPublicationTypegtJOURNAL ARTICLEltPublicationTypegt                 ltPublicationTypeListgt                 ltArticleDate DateTypeElectronicgt                     ltYeargt2014ltYeargt                     ltMonthgt5ltMonthgt                     ltDaygt30ltDaygt                 ltArticleDategt             ltArticlegt             ltMedlineJournalInfogt                 ltMedlineTAgtBMB RepltMedlineTAgt                 ltNlmUniqueIDgt101465334ltNlmUniqueIDgt                 ltISSNLinkinggt19766696ltISSNLinkinggt             ltMedlineJournalInfogt         ltMedlineCitationgt         ltPubmedDatagt             ltHistorygt                 ltPubMedPubDate PubStatusentrezgt                     ltYeargt2014ltYeargt                     ltMonthgt5ltMonthgt                     ltDaygt31ltDaygt                     ltHourgt6ltHourgt                     ltMinutegt0ltMinutegt                 ltPubMedPubDategt                 ltPubMedPubDate PubStatuspubmedgt                     ltYeargt2014ltYeargt                     ltMonthgt5ltMonthgt                     ltDaygt31ltDaygt                     ltHourgt6ltHourgt                     ltMinutegt0ltMinutegt                 ltPubMedPubDategt                 ltPubMedPubDate PubStatusmedlinegt                     ltYeargt2014ltYeargt                     ltMonthgt5ltMonthgt                     ltDaygt31ltDaygt                     ltHourgt6ltHourgt                     ltMinutegt0ltMinutegt                 ltPubMedPubDategt             ltHistorygt             ltPublicationStatusgtaheadofprintltPublicationStatusgt             ltArticleIdListgt                 ltArticleId IdTypepiigt2831ltArticleIdgt                 ltArticleId IdTypepubmedgt24874852ltArticleIdgt             ltArticleIdListgt         ltPubmedDatagt     ltPubmedArticlegt ltPubmedArticleSetgt codepre  pMy intention is to reorganise the data in another webpage.

My problem is that I have no idea how can I figure out if my worker thread is currently busy or not.p  pI have a predicate condition with a conditional wait like sop  precodewhile  threadstuffgtpredcond  0       retval  pthreadcondwait ampthreadstuffgtworksignal, ampthreadstuffgtbusymutex     if retval 0            strerrorrretval, strerrorbuf, ERRNOBUFSIZE         printfcond wait error  thread u, error sn, threadstuffgtthreadid, strerrorbuf       codepre  pNow How can I make sure a thread is not busy. If I set a variable protected by a mutex AFTER it has woken up from the signal I get a race condition as I have no guarantee that the variable gets set before my consumer checks again for waiting threads. p  pthe only way I see what I could do is do a codepthreadmutextrylockcode on it with the same mutex that is coupled with the conditional wait however this seems kind of expensive and not elegant. p  pIs there some other way, better way to do something like this, that is figure whether a thread is currently waiting at the predicate conditionp  pregardsp

Negative 243 pIm using CSS counters to create a set of lists and subheadings.

However, if I use javascript to change the class from question to subheading Chrome wont reset the counters. This works fine in Firefox v19 and Internet Explorer 8p  pTheres a JSFiddle herep  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netNW43P1 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netNW43P1ap  pAs you can see the first subheading, which is loaded statically, correctly resets the counter. However, the second Heading, which is generated dynamically, fails to reset the counter.p  pIm not sure if this is a bug in chrome or a problem with my code Im betting the latter, but does anyone know of a fixp  pThanks for any helpp

Negative 243 pIn my application, I have an import data feature. Currently when someone uploads the CSV file and submits the page, they see the spinner indicating that the file is uploading. After about a minute or so, the page will refresh once the import is complete.p  pI wanted to make the page a little bit friendlier by adding a progress bar of the import. My import class loops over every line in the CSV to import the data, so I added a bit of code so that after every few loops, it will write the percentage to a file with the intent that I can use an AJAX request to read that file and display the percentage.p  pI came to the point where I wanted to read the file, but any AJAX request I send after submitting the form doesnt ever return back to me. It seems that the server knows that the page is going to be refreshed so it doesnt even bother. Looking at the requests in the Network tab in Chromes Developer Tools shows the Status of pending, and none of them ever change.p  pIs there some way that I can keep making AJAX requests after I submit a form As a side note, the application needs to support IE9 so using the File API to submit the file through AJAX is not an option.p

Negative 243 pMy problem is that I do not think I am able to refresh the magento redis cache from the admin page. I realize that the problem could come from many sources, but my gut tells me it has something to do with the backend being on a separate server. My magento installation is as followsp  ul liMagento CE 1.8li liBackend server and NFSmedia on an Amazon AWS EC2 at a hrefhttpadmin.example.com relnofollowhttpadmin.example.comali liDatabase on AWS RDS MySQL 2 app servers scalable to more on AWS Elastic Beanstalk at a hrefhttpwww.example.com relnofollowhttpwww.example.coma route53 li liregular backend cachedatabase 0, LestiFPCdatabase 0, and redissession database 1 on AWS elasticache redisli ul  pI originally had my LestiFPC configured to use database 2 on the redis cache. I thought it worked pretty well as far as I could tell, until I realized that I couldnt flush the cache at all from the admin SystemCache Management page. Flush Magento Cache, Flush Cache Storage, disable, and refresh did nothing. I could only flush it by rebooting the redis node or going in with rediscli and using redis commands.p  pI then tried configuring LestiFPC to use database 0 as described above. It worked better. Now, I could flush the FPC with Flush Cache Storage, although the other options still didnt work. At the time, I assumed it was an issue specifically with LestiFPC. But anyway, using Flush Cache Storage was good enough for me at the time, especially once I discovered that I could flush the cache through code usingp  precodeMageappgtgetCacheInstancegtflush codepre  pI just recently found out that the problem may not be specific to LestiFPC. While trying to fix the Lesti issue, I tried monitoring redis. I know nothing about redis or caching, but when I would try to refresh the FPC, I would see commands likep  precodedel zcti403FPC srem zctags 403FPC codepre  pBut those tags never existed. Doingp  precodekeys FPC codepre  pin redis would give mep  precodezcti109FPC codepre  pbut nothing with 403. SO this means that my fpc caches do not get invalidated like theyre supposed to after productcategory changes and reindexing. I got around this by manually flushing the cache after changes and running cron jobs to flush and prime the fpc every few hours. p  pBut it made me suspicious. I tried refreshing the other caches from the admin, and I found that magento would always try to delete and read the 403 keyssome of which existed and some of which did not but never any 109 keys of which there are many. p  pMy guess is that the 403 keys are specific to the admin server, and the 109 keys are specific to the app servers. The admin server, maybe because it is on a different subdomain, is not touching the app servers cached stuff. But the app servers are able to find its own keys fine, as demonstrated by the fact that the FPC is working very well.p  pDoes this make sense Is there something I could do to fix this Did I configure something incorrectly or is this a magento bug p
Negative 243 pIm working with C5.NET 4.5 in Visual Studio 2013 Pro on Windows 7.p  pId like to work with collections of items where the only requirement is that the items implement a specific interface.  The items in the collection will not necessarily be part of a common inheritance tree i.e. the collection will not be based on a common ancestor, they could be arbitrary classes but will all implement the specified interface so the goal is to base the collection on the common interface that they all implement.p  pIm having trouble with this.  If I have a collection of items which implement the desired interface, Im unable to pass that collection to a method which requires a collection based on the interface.p  pHeres some code to make this more concrete.p  precodeusing System.Collections.Generic  class Test      public interface IDrawable              void Draw           public class Shape  IDrawable              public void Draw            public void DrawItemsListltIDrawablegt itemsToDraw       public Test              ListltShapegt shapes  new ListltShapegt         DrawItemsshapes       codepre  pThe call to DrawItems generates a compiler error.  The method is expecting a collection of items implementing IDrawable.  Im passing in a collection of Shape objects.  Since the Shape objects do implement IDrawable, I was hoping I could get away with this.p  pLooks like this will not work, but Im trying to understand why.  I looked up info on covariance and contravariance, but didnt find anything specifically addressing this case.p  pAny ideas or info on why this doesnt workp

Negative 243 pAccording to some qampa I understand that iText text extraction tool is not capable to recognize underline and strikethrough font attributes due to the PDF specification not supporting it. To allow recognition I did update PdfContentStreamProcessor.java by adding shape subpath recognition. I did also add ShapeRenderInfo.java to contain graphics info.p  pFor instance recognizing underline means start from a TextRenderInfo object and scan all ShapeRenderInfo to try to match rectangle containsintersect ... etc the By reading qampa I did understand that  iText text extraction tool is not supporting  underline strikethrough, overstrike, ... font attributes recognitions due to PDF specification allowing underline only by drawing shapes under text. To achieve underline recognition I did update PdfContentStreamProcessor.java by adding shape subpath management, I did also add ShapeRenderInfo.java to contain graphics rendering parameters.p  pMy idea is to have  underline recognized by getting Rectangles2D from both TextRenderInfo and ShapeRenderInfo and by checking for containmentintersection between them.p  pWhat Im doing implies a noticeable change in how currently iText delivers events to RenderListener, because they are currently propagated as encountered in the pdf streams, on the contrary I need that XxxxxRenderObjects are collected first, then delivered at page end, thus allowing searching through rectangles.p  pIn brief  isUnderline method on TextRenderInfo, will start scanning into collected shapes trying to match graphic objects  rectangles against text rectangles.p  pBeside the need to update RenderListener.java to allow ShapeRender events propagation, I did identified the following possible solutions to implement the logic changep  p1 update PdfContentStreamProcessor implementing the new event delivery policyp  p2 shield PdfContentStreamProcessor and RenderListeners by inserting a new layer a new listener capable to handle the logicp  pMy question to the iText team is What is the best choice Have you any further suggestionp  pThank you beforehandp  pJQ.p

Negative 243 pI am wanting to make a web application which uses the Google Drive API to access a friends spreadsheet located on his Google Drive.  It will be readingwriting to the sheet but nothing more, and only that sheet.  Suffice to say, I have spent the last two days reading up documentation for the Google Drive API and have little to show for it.  I just cant make sense of it, no matter how many examples I read because the API doesnt match what the examples show.  There must be 45 different ways that I found of authentication with OAuth2.0 but none will work with the Drive API that I got off the NuGet package manager which is where Google said to get the latest API.  Nothing makes sense. The OAuth2Parameters class doesnt exist so I dont know how to authenticate with the examples google gives.  Similar ways end with the same result with other examples, like Googles DrEdit.  Can anyone provide some insight  The spreadsheet will be hosted by my friend me if necessary and the web application will be hosted by a free service, say AppHarbor.  Thank you very much.p

Negative 243 pIm trying to do an adaptation of the merge sort using a fork join. Im using this as a forkjoin example so I need to keep it basic. I want to edit the regular merge sort so that when the segment size goes below 101 100 or less it will use an insertion sort to sort that segment and then come out of the recursive call and start merging the segments back together. The sort is just simply not working. If I change the order of the invoke and jointo stop other code from running it works fine so Im assuming it is because my sorts are running concurrently that it is not correct.

How to expand the strings in it without executing any external programs, and without executing pipes which is dangerousp  pThe simple codelineecho linecode doesnt work at all.  When I try codelinebash c echo linecode I have better luck, but then I need to export ALL bash variables to the spawned bash which I have no idea how to do. And calling the external program for it seems like a overkill besides the bash will execute the pipes and external programs, if e.g. codelineecho rm r code. p  pIs there any way to do the variable expansion that will not involve writing a Bash parser from scratch   I only need it to work under Linux Ubuntu  14.04 to be precise.p  pFor a full picture I include the prototype of the functionp  precodefunction lognextline      if [ n log ] then         fileBASHSOURCE[1]  Takes path to the file, from where the function is called         linenrBASHLINENO[0]  1  Line number         linesed linenrqd file Reads this line number from the source file         lineecho line DOESNT WORK.

Negative 243 pI am trying to route stereo audio through a codechannelsplittercode to 6 channels with gain controls, and then back into a codechannelMergercode, to control all 6 channels of a 5.1 set. The set is connected through HDMI, and windows outputs to all 6 channels correctly a screen where you can let all 6 speakers play a sound separately.p  pThe only examples I could find have this piece of codep  precodeif context.destination.maxChannelCount gt 6      context.destination.channelCount  6  else      context.destination.channelCount  2  codepre  pWhen initialising the audiocontext, my channelCount defaults to 2 and the maxChannelCount is 6.p  pI use the following code to create the splitter, merger and gains inbetweenp  precodeif context.destination.maxChannelCount gt 6      context.destination.channelCount  6  else      context.destination.channelCount  2   context.destination.channelCountMode  explicit context.destination.channelInterpretation  discrete  var ammount  context.destination.channelCount  console.logAmmount of channels,ammount this outputs 6  window.channelSplitter  context.createChannelSplitterammount window.channelMerger  context.createChannelMergerammount  postGain.connectchannelSplitter postGain is the last node of the audio system channelMerger.connectcontext.destination window.channelGains  [] fori0iltammounti     channelGains[i]  context.createGain      channelSplitter.connectchannelGains[i],i,0     channelGains[i].connectchannelMerger,0,i  codepre  pI have tried this in chrome39.0.2171.71 m, where maxChannelCount is 6.

Negative 243 pIm running PHP commandline scripts as rabbitmq consumers which need to connect to a MySQL database. Those scripts run as a hrefhttpsymfony.comdoccurrentcomponentsconsoleintroduction.html relnofollowSymfony2 commandsa using a hrefhttpwww.doctrineproject.org relnofollowDoctrine2a ORM, meaning opening and closing the database connection is handled behind the scenes. The connection is normally closed automatically when the cli command exits  which is by definition not happening for a long time in a background consumer.p  pThis is a problem when the consumer is idle no incoming messages longer then the codewaittimeoutcode setting in the MySQL server configuration. If no message is consumed longer than that period, the database server will close the connection and the next message will fail with a codeMySQL server has gone awaycode exception.p  pIve thought about 2 solutions for the problemp  ol liOpen the connection before each message and close the connection  manually after handling the message.li liImplementing a codepingcode message which runs a dummy SQL query like codeSELECT 1 FROM tablecode each n minutes and call it using a cronjob.li ol  pThe problem with the first approach is If the traffic on that queue is high, there might be a significant overhead for the consumer in openingclosing connections. The second approach just sounds like an ugly hack to deal with the issue, but at least i can use a single connection during high load times.p  pAre there any better solutions for handling doctrine connections in background scriptsp

The browser makes a javascript request which does not fail and then sands a hash to the server in the HTTP header. I guess that procedure is working.p  pI guessed that it could be a malfunctioning OpenSSL configuration, but the install tool says PHP OpenSSL extension installed properly.p  pThe server is runs on CentOS 6.5 with SELinux in the Microsoft Azure cloud. PHP Version is 5.5.20. The Apache server runs in the version 2.2.22. Typo3 Version 6.2.6.p  pHas anybody an idea, what could be wrongp  pThanks in advance for your help.p

Negative 243 pIm used to creating Singletons to implement a globally shared state, and Im reading about how Singletons arent testable and that the Factory pattern should be used instead. The problem Im having is that I cant see where would be a good place to create the Factory object, in order for it to be accessible everywhere.p  pMost online examples of the Factory pattern show the object creation in the codeMaincode method. Im programming in the context of a Web application which is packaged in a WAR.p  pFor example, lets say I have codeServletAcode and codeServletBcode. codeServletAcode creates an instance of the codeFactoryClasscode but when codeServletBcode is invoked, it wont have access to the codeFactoryClasscodes instance.p  pIm new to trying to implement the Factory pattern and I want to try do it the right way, instead of using a Singleton. Also, I want to be able to write more testable code.p

Negative 243 pIve tried to look for a solution for this, however havent been able to so I thought Id start the a new question.p  pWhat Im wanting to do is to revert files that have been edited on a particular date, to revert back to its previous revision.  The reason for this is because a malware was found on my computer, where it had ENCRYPTED all of my files.  Since I had the Google Drive application on my desktop running, the malware Encrypted those files and Google Drive had synced it to the cloud...So currently I have a bunch of corrupted files sitting in Google Drive.p  pI can go into each file to manually manage revision and revert it back to the working version, however this has taken me hours and hours to do, due to the amount of files.  p  pIve done abit of reading about the Google Drive API which could possibily be used, but am no expert programmer, so Id just like to ask if anyone has any suggestionsknow of the best way to fix this problem.p  pCheers, Alfredp

Negative 243 pThe issue in question involves an codeAddItemViewcode which is presented modally by its delegate and contains a tableView.

The modally presented view containing the tableView cannot be dismissed after user selection because the user needs to be able to select multiple items from the table and, one by one, send them back to the delegate for processing.p  pCurrently, the UIAlerView is not being displayed and I suspect it is because the alreadypresented modal is preventing that.

Negative 243 pI have an MVC 5 website on .NET 4.5.  I also have 2 API on the same server both built on .NET.  The website makes asynchronous web service calls to the APIs on the same server.  It seems that these calls are leaving the ports open until they timeout even though I am disposing the client.  With the site usage growing this is starting to become an issue because I am running out of ports during high volumes of traffic.

Negative 243 pI am using android studio 1.1.0. I want to disable specific lint checks like Incomplete Translation. So, I went to File  Settings...

I would like to refactor most of our legacy ASM code in C in order to increase readability and modularity. p  pSo I am still puzzling with minor details which causes my hopes to vanish. The real problem is far more complex that this following example, but I would like to share this as an entry point to the discussion.p  pMy goal is to find a optimal workaround. p  pHere is the original example do not worry about what the code does.

Especially when the source code is about 300k lines long with almost 3000 global variables. p  pHere we are not facing a compiler problem, but a structural issue. Writing beautiful, portable, readable, modular and robust code will never pass the ultimate performance test because compilers are dumb, even is 2015.p  pAn alternative solution is to rather prefer codeinlinecode functions. Unfortunately these functions have to be located into a header file which is also ugly. p  pA compiler cannot see further the file it is working on. When a function is marked as codeexterncode it will irrevocably lead to performance issues. The reason is the compiler cannot make any assumptions regarding the external declarations. p  pIn the other way, the linker could do the job and ask the compiler to rebuild objects files by givin additionnal information to the compiler. Unfortunately not many compilers offer such features and when they do, they considerably slow down the build process. p  pI eventually came accross this dilemma p  ol lipKeep the code ugly to preserve performancesp  ul liEverythings globalli liFunctions without parameters same as proceduresli liKeeping everything in the same fileli ulli lipFollow standards and write clean codep  ul liThink of modulesli liWrite small but numerous functions with well defined parametersli liWrite small but numerous source filesli ulli ol  pWhat to do when the target architecture has limited ressources.

Negative 243 pI am using cancan with a straight forward ability.rb file. Most of my abilities are rather a rather simple combo of crud rights on models limited by a users role.

I dont know where to go from here any help would be appreciated p  pIts my belief that the first ability is using the company that the user belongs to to evaluate to true and for the read rule, its using the company thats passed into the block.

Negative 243 pI am looking for a way to compare a string which in this case will be a line from a text file to every element in an array and see if there is a match.  At a high level overview, I have a string array about 100 elements full of strings that are all contained somewhere in the file that need to be deleted.

Negative 243 pSo I was wondering, with the default game Xcode configuration.  How would you make another SKScene  Like lets say I wanted to have a menu or somethingp  pBasically how would I create another document titled title.swift and then programmatically be able to switch back and forth through them  That way I could go from a menu to the game scene without muddling up my codep  pI cant find where in the remade code code it actually tell swift to display the game scene that was premade with the game configuration.p  pI figure I make a new class and have it inherit SKScene.p

Negative 243 pIve been racking my brain against this program for a couple months now.  This was an assignment of a class I took last semester and while I passed, I could never make this one assignment work correctly Seg Fault.  I welcome any help or tips but I greatly appreciate explanations with answers to follow along.p  pThis program is supposed to receive a filename that contains a list of filenames 240 for my example.  Those files are located in a folder within the same directory as the list and the program.  This program is supposed to take this list and parse it for 4 threads, splitting the filenames evenly for each thread 60 per thread for my example.  Each thread then takes this list of 60 file names and opens each file one by one performing a emWordCountem function on each file.  Once the threads complete their tasks, they are supposed to print the results for each file in order with each thread in its own blocki.e. Thread1 Results  Thread2 Results  Thread 3 Results, etc....p  pIve debugged quite a bit and know that up until the threads are created everything works as it is supposed to.  My problem seems to be during thread launchexecution.  Ive tried adding mutex to the mix but sadly it hasnt helped.  I seem to be missing something or over thinking something as some of my class mates have shown me their much more compact code.  Please assist.

Ive also tried codedidSetcode and codewillSetcode but Xcode threw errors at me, as I think that is only available for primitives.p
