Positive 10593 pI need some help. I have to classify the wikilinks in Wikipedia articles based on their relative position in the article in best case on the rendered page. For each wikilink I would like to obtain the position in text i.e., a numbering ascending for each article or articlesection and if the link is contained in an infobox or a navibox. I need this information for a specific revision of every article in the English Wikipedia in the zero namespace. p  pSo far, I first tried  parsing the wikitext myself from a dump file, but there are  some problems with replacing the templates. For example, if a template is embedded with parameters andor with conditions, it is a bit difficult to know what exactly is rendered. Then, I tried out several parser from a hrefhttpswww.mediawiki.orgwikiAlternativeparsers relnofollowhttpswww.mediawiki.orgwikiAlternativeparsersa that claim to handle templates, but they did not work out mainly due the same problems that I had parsing wikitext myself. As a result, I am now considering parsing the html of a wikipedia article. For that purpose, I tried to use the MediaWiki API a hrefhttpswww.mediawiki.orgwikiAPIParsingwikitext relnofollowhttpswww.mediawiki.orgwikiAPIParsingwikitexta in order to retrieve the html for an article and parse it myself. However, the API is very slow for previous revisions of an article and it will take me forever. p  pThus, my question has two parts 1. What is the fastest way  to get the html of an article for specific revision or what is the best tool to setup local copy of wikipedia currently experimenting with xowa and wikitaxi from a dump. 2. Is somebody aware of a html Wikipedia parser that could provide e.g. the position of link or a classification of the links regarding position in text section, if a link is in a infobox and if it is in a navibox.p

Negative 10593 pIm developing a C application on Windows Mobile, and like most of my WM applications, I always get bogged down whenever Im deciding on a serialization strategy.   In the desktop world, Im not too worried about it because ive already developed a pretty robust custom xml serializer  however, in the WM world, I dont want to use it because of the reflection performance penalties.p  pSo I develop everything against Data Access Objects DAO interfaces, so I can easily swap out different implementations for serializing to xml, registry, sqlce, etc.    While developing in the beginning, I usually implement a nonpersistent inmemory DAO using Dictionarylt, followed by a XmlSerializer DAO when I want to persist data, and then when everythings completed, move to a fullblown sqlce DAO.p  pHowever, in my latest app, I cant use an XmlSerializer DAO because of how badly it doesnt handle properties that are interfaces.   IE, I have a Foo object which contains a Listlt IBar  Bars property, XmlSerializer cant serialize it although I was easily able to develop my own custom xml serializer which could  go figure.p  pAll that to ask this question   What DAO strategies have you found to help you develop applications for WM   Do you plan ahead for several different DAOs at different app maturity levels   Do you start at the fullblown sqlce DAO   What would you recommend for a quickandeasy persistent serialization DAO when XmlSerializer cant be usedp

Negative 10593 pOur development team has a number of semitechnical users that act as intermediaries between our developers and domain experts. One of their tasks is building forms using a very clumsy, antiquated system that makes their job much harder than it should be.p  pId quite like to create toolbox controls similar to the standard HTML controls that simply render an MVC partial e.g.p  precodelt Html.RenderPartialUserProfilePartial, ViewModel.UserProfile gt codepre  pbut presented as a friendly toolbox item with an icon. This way our developers can create reusable form elements that they can simply drag and drop around in the design view. While this may sound like anathema to most developers, theyre quite excited about the possibility.p  pCreating a custom server control does not appear to be the right approach, as it always insists upon adding a register statement to the head of the view, and it also seems to insist upon rendering controls with the codeltcc0...gtcode prefix.p  pHow can I create a Toolbox control that just renders arbitrary markupp

Negative 10593 pI originally built my site in MVC 1.0 using the NerdDinner tutorial as a basic outline.  Many of the early design decisions were made simply bc thats how NerdDinner did it  Since then, it has really grown and was converted to 2.0.p  pMy validation still works the way NerdDinner did it and is very minimal, so although Ive read about other ways, there was never any reason to change it.p  pI recently added some new fields of type decimal.  Upon release, the user tried to enter values 3000 and 3,000 and got a basic not valid error.  I explained to him that he could only enter numbers in the field.  I went into my validation, and added better validation for that field so that in the future they could get a more descriptive message.  However, the fields value is being passed to my validation routine as null.  If a valid decimal is entered, then it is passed to the validation routine.  I had a validation for my date fields already there as well, and realized that the same thing is happening for them.  All of my other validations are strings, and the validation is checking for things like characters which I dont allow, and that works great.  But, in those cases its not actually checking for something that the db would find to be invalid.p  pThis is a sample of my validationp  precode  public IEnumerableltRuleViolationgt GetRuleViolations               if String.IsNullOrEmptysubcontractno.Trim             yield return new RuleViolationSubcontract Number is required, subcontractno          if db.subcontracts.Counts gt s.subcontractno  subcontractno ampamp s.subcontractid  subcontractid gt 0             yield return new RuleViolationSubcontract Number already exists, subcontractno          if subcontractno.Contains  quick fix, needs better validation             yield return new RuleViolationSubcontract Number cannot contain , subcontractno         if isValidDateexpirationdate.ToString             yield return new RuleViolationExpiration Date is not valid, expirationdate          if isValidDecimalinsuranceGLminreq.ToString             yield return new RuleViolationInsurance GL Level must be a number, insuranceGLminreq codepre  pThe isValidDate and isValidDecimal routines work as I would expect, the problem is that if the value for insuranceGLminreq isnt a decimal, it gets passed as null rather than 3,000 or whatever.  Instead of the user seeing the Insurance GL Level must be a number message, they see The value 3,000 is not valid for insuranceGLminreq.  Id like the message to be more descriptive so they know why it isnt valid, also Id rather if they didnt see the actual field name but something that matched the label for the field.p  pIs there a relatively quick way to fix this that doesnt involve rewriting how validations are done  This section of the site only has 3 users, and Ive already explained to them to only input the number.  I want this to work properly, but at this point and for this minor issue, I cannot spend a lot of time redoing it to use another validation method.p

Negative 10593 pI have a client that communicates with a web service. The class that I communicate with is a C class that is generated through wsdl.exe. I now want to log all incoming and outgoing messages. p  pWhat Ive done so far is to write a class that inherits from the automatically generated C Class and I have overridden the GetReaderForMessage method. That way I can access the incoming message more or less like thisp  precodeprotected override XmlReader GetReaderForMessageSoapClientMessage message, int bufferSize      System.Xml.XmlReader aReader  base.GetReaderForMessagemessage, bufferSize     System.Xml.XmlDocument doc  new System.Xml.XmlDocument     doc.LoadaReader     string content  doc.InnerXml.ToString     System.Xml.XmlReader aReader2  System.Xml.XmlReader.Createnew System.IO.StringReadercontent      return aReader2  codepre  pObviously Im not too happy with this solution, because basically Im creating two xml readers. One to read the contents of the SOAP message and one to return to the method caller.

Is it for instance possible to read the contents of the SoapClientMessage object directly Ive read some articles suggesting that I should use SoapExtensions here, but from what I can understand, that would only work if the client that I am creating is itself a web service which in this case it is not.p  pAny suggestionsp

Negative 10593 pBasically Im looking for the best way to remove the need to hard code any actual URLs within views when two different URLs call the same controller action.  As shown below, two routes define different URLs, one for creating a new customer, whilst the other is for editing an existing customer.  Inside the controller action it determines what to do by checking the value of AccountNumber  if it was not provided null then it knows that it is creating a new customer.p  precoderoutes.MapRoute     CustomerEdit,     CustomerEditCustNum,     new  controller  Customer, action  Edit, AccountNumber  CustNum    routes.MapRoute     CustomerCreate,     CustomerCreate,     new  controller  Customer, action  Edit   codepre  pThe downside to this approach is that you cant use codeUrl.Action...code in the views to determine the URL because there are two different URLs mapping to the controller action. I had hoped that the call to codeUrl.Action...code would determine which to use by the RouteValues provided, but it just appears to use the 1st matching route defined.  So in this case if you callp  pcodeUrl.ActionEdit, Customer, new  CustNum  2 codep  pyou get  CustomerEdit2 as youd expect, but if you callp  pcodeUrl.ActionEdit, Customercodep  pthe view outputs the URL CustomerEditCustNum.  p  pIs there anyway using this configuration that you would not need to hard code URLs into the view  Or is it considered better practise to have a separate action for creating new customers and another action for editing customers, so you end up with the followingp  precodepublic class CustomerController  Controller       public ActionResult Create       return CreateOrEditnull        public ActionResult Editint custNum       return CreateOrEditcustNum        private ActionResult CreateOrEditint custNum      ....  codepre

Negative 10593 pI suppose much like standard arrays i.e integer arrays, when you pass an array of structs you must pass the size of the array with it.

I inspect the size of a single array element remember it will be one struct I get something like 28, but after Ive passed it into a function and yes by passed into the function I mean passed by value the address of the first element in my array, I only get 4. p  pNow Im guessing the sizeof is getting the first element of my struct in the array. So I have my array myArray of type myStructp  pmyStruct  String name String address String postcode p  pI presume sizeof is looking at name But I know for a fact that name isnt 4 bytes long  its 10.p  pWhat exactly is the sizeof looking at What does the memory structure look like of an array of structsp  pThanks Thomasp

Negative 10593 pI work on developer tools for a particular product.  There is a competing set of tools for the same product produced by a different company.  The userbase is split roughly 5050 between us.p  pRecently, the other company has introduced scripting to make their own tools extensible by endusers.  This is a feature that we have had planned for our tools for a while, but it is only now that we are able to start implementing it.p  pMy question is should we try as much as possible to collaborate with the developers of competing product so that enduser scripts can be shared between users on the different products  We would obviously require different implementations, but share the same syntax.  This would obviously be better for the community as a whole since there would be more interoperability.p  pThe downside of collaborating like this is that the competing products scripting language is slightly tailored towards their own implementation.  We would have to jump through a few hoops to create an implementation for their scripts on our platform.  Or, we would have to somehow convince our competitor to modify their scripts so that they are platform agnostic.p  pSo, to rephrase my question should we try to collaborate, thus making our community happier, or should we produce a competing scripting language that is more appropriate for our platformp  pI realize that this is a very general question with no single right or wrong answer.  What I am looking for is a good explanation of the pros and cons of each approach.p

Negative 10593 pIve been having a real issue trying to make Rpy2 play nice with my R install. I first tried installing the rpy2 MSI package, and this didnt appear to work. When I ran the recommended tests, it was giving me an error saying that it couldnt find the R.dll, because the new R installs post 2.11 install the DLLs into an i386 folder, where rpy2 cant find them because its looking in the bin folder instead of the bini386 folder.p  pThen I tried to build the install from scratch myself using the command line tools distutils included with python. This didnt work, because setup.py claimed to be unable to find the Rhome location. But I did work out that editing an environment variable PATH might show the rpy2 setup where to find the R installation. I then made a couple of edits to the environment, adding the Rhome variable pointing to the bini386 directory, and made a new entry under the PATH variable, pointing to the same spot.p  pUnfortunately, when it found the R path, I got this issue insteadp  precoderunning build running buildpy running buildext Traceback most recent call last   File setup.py, line 372, in ltmodulegt     [os.path.joindoc, source, rpy2logo.png]]   File CPython26libdistutilscore.py, line 152, in setup     dist.runcommands   File CPython26libdistutilsdist.py, line 975, in runcommands     self.runcommandcmd   File CPython26libdistutilsdist.py, line 995, in runcommand     cmdobj.run   File CPython26libdistutilscommandbuild.py, line 134, in run     self.runcommandcmdname   File CPython26libdistutilscmd.py, line 333, in runcommand     self.distribution.runcommandcommand   File CPython26libdistutilsdist.py, line 994, in runcommand     cmdobj.ensurefinalized   File CPython26libdistutilscmd.py, line 117, in ensurefinalized     self.finalizeoptions   File setup.py, line 111, in finalizeoptions     config  getrconfigrhome, about   File setup.py, line 264, in getrconfig     rc  RConfig.fromstringrconfig   File setup.py, line 252, in fromstring      nin stringn  string ValueError Invalid substring in string codepre  pSo I went back to trying to use the premade install, thinking that maybe the new edits to the environment might work but got this issue here p  precode Traceback most recent call last       File ltstringgt, line 245, in runnodebug       File CDocuments and SettingsUserDesktoprpy22.1.9rpytests.py, line 3, in ltmodulegt         import rpy2.robjects.tests       File CPython26libsitepackagesrpy2robjectsinit.py, line 12, in ltmodulegt         import rpy2.rinterface as rinterface       File CPython26libsitepackagesrpy2rinterfaceinit.py, line 56, in ltmodulegt         raise RuntimeErrorUnable to locate R.dll within s  RHOME     RuntimeError Unable to locate R.dll within CProgram FilesRR2.12.1bini386 codepre  pThis is REALLY weird, because as anyone can check on their own install R installs R.dll into CProgram FilesRR2.12.1bini386 and Ive checked and verified that its in there, and Ive pointed rpy2 to this directory in the windows default PATH I know for a fact that rpy2 is looking in the right place, but cant understand why its not seeing R.dll.p  pSo why cant rpy2 find it And does anyone know a way to get rpy2 working with R 2.12 Perhaps I should try the newer rpy2 2.2.0 version Its still in development though, and 1.9 is supposed to be able to handle R 2.12 according to this a hrefhttprpy.sourceforge.netrpy2doc2.2htmloverview.htmlrequirementswebsitea so I dont know what to do...p  pThanks to anyone who can help out...p  p[EDIT] Ive also tried these instructions over a hrefhttpwww.mailarchive.comrpylistlists.sourceforge.netmsg02817.htmlherea but they return the same cant find DLL error...

Negative 10593 pCan I create WPF controls by using XSLT to transform XML Datap  pIf I cant do that, then maybe I could use a web browser control in a WPF grid to display the controls I create from XSLT I am doing this in an ASP.NET application, so I am familiar with that process but, how would I respond to events triggered in the web browser control if the user clicks a button, etc Could I also do the same thing in a Windows Forms application p  pIf I can reuse the XSLT and XML from my web application and use it to generate the display in my desktop standalone, disconnected application then this would be the optitmum situation.

Negative 10593 pas a follow on from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5231579hibernateoptionaljoinhibernate optional joinap  pMany existing queries in the system rely on there being a mapped relationship between EntityOne and EntityTwo and changing this is not an attactive option, however I now need to start storing and retrieving values in codetblone.twoidcode which do not exist in the joined table.

Negative 10593 pIve been working on a simple frequency detection setup on the iphone. Analyzing in the frequency domain using FFT results has been somewhat unreliable in the presence of harmonics. I was hoping to use Cepstrum results to help decide what fundamental frequency is playing.p  pI am working with AudioQueues in the AudioToolbox framework, and do the Fourier transforms using the Accelerate framework. p  pMy process has been exactly what is listed on Wikipedias Cepstrum article for the Real Power Cepstrum, specifically signal  FT  abs  square  log  FT  abs  square  power cepstrum.p  pThe problem I have is that the Cepstrum results are extremely noisy. I have to drop the first and last 20 values as they are astronomical compared to the other values. Even after cleaning the data, there is still a huge amount of variation  far more than I would expect given the first graph. See the pictures below for the visualizations of the frequency domain and the quefrency domain. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comC2ExC.png altFFT a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comjaKLu.pngFFTa img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comsw3Ot.png altCepstrum a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comWoteg.pngCepstrumap  pWhen I see such a clear winner in the frequency domain as on that graph, I expect to see a similarly clear result in the quefrency domain. I played A440 and would expect bin 82 or so to have the highest magnitude. The third peak on the graph represents bin 79, which is close enough. As I said, the first 20 or so bins are so astronomical in magnitude as to be unusuable, and I had to delete them from the data set in order to see anything. Another odd quality of the cepstrum data is that the even bins seem to be much higher than the odd bins. Here are the frequency bins from 7786 p  precode77 151150.0313 78  22385.92773 79 298753.1875 80  56532.72656 81 114177.4766 82  31222.88281 83   4620.785156 84  13382.5332 85     83.668259 86 1205.023193 codepre  pMy question is how to clean up the frequency domain so that my Cepstrum domain results are not so wild. Alternately, help me better understand how to interpret these results if they are as one would expect in a Cepstrum analysis. I can post examples of the code Im using, but it mostly uses vDSP calls and I dont know how helpful that would be.p

Negative 10593 pI am designing a multitenant system and am considering sharding by tenant at the application layer level instead of database. p  pHypothetically, the way this should work is that for incoming request a router process has a global collection of tenants containing primary attributes to determine the tenant for this request as well as the virtual shard id. This virtual shard id is further mapped to an actual shard. p  pThe actual shard contains both the code for application as well as whole data for this tenant. These shards would be LNMP Linux, Nginx, MySQLMongoDB, PHP servers.p  pThe router process should act as proxy. It should be able to run some code to determine the target shard for incoming request based on the collection stored in some local db or files. To be able to scale this better, i am considering making the shards themselves act as routers also so that they can run a reverse proxy that will forward the request to appropriate shard.  Maybe the nginx instance running on shard can also act as that reverse proxy. But how will it execute the application logic needed to match up the request with the appropriate shard.p  pI will appreciate any ideas and suggestions for this router implementation.p  pThanksp

Negative 10593 pI have been reading a book called a hrefhttprads.stackoverflow.comamznclick0132350882 relnofollowClean Code A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanshipa. The author in the book motivates that a switch statement should be avoided and if it cannot be avoided it should be relegated to factory methods. I have a connection object which is receiving various PDUs protocol data units. The PDUs vary and they can be received in any order. So if I have a method for examplep  precodepublic BasePdu ReceiveNext codepre  pbecause I cannot tell what the packet type is until it has been fully received. In the header of the PDU is an identifier as to which type it should be. This means that the calling method is going to have figure out what the type of the PDU is and based on that call the relevant method to handle it. This sounds like a perfect example for a switch statement. The object that contains the connection I would ideally like to have two threads. One for receiving PDUs and another for servicing a queue of PDUs to be sent.p  pNow I know that you cannot follow every bit of good advice and that there are just some circumstances which are the exception to the rule. Is this one of them Or is there a way around this that I just have not yet thought of.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pI hear what a lot of people are saying by creating subclasses of response handlers. The issue is that the containing object has a lot of context and additional information that the handlers would need for example lookups and throttling etc etc. To inject all of this information into subclasses of handlers would be quite a chore to maintain and would also split a lot of logic up when it feels better to be encapsulated in the object that it is in now.p

Negative 10593 pIm working with an application that uses and manages a large amount of OSGi services and implementations for each service, with properties, dynamism and so. Using the command line of the Equinox console is useful, with commands like emservicesem or emlist cem . However, it is difficult to see specific implementations of services, and obtain a current snapshot of bounded or available services to consume. For example, you can see if the bundle references are satisfied, but you cant see which are the implementations of those satisfied references although there are another mechanisms, of course.p  pSo, the idea is to find a GUI with organized information for example, using graphs to increase the performance when you are developing in OSGi. Maybe there is one GUI in Eclipse plugin perspective, but I cant find it.p  pIf you dont know anything like this, Ive in mind to create my own for my thesis p

Negative 10593 pWell, the title is selfexplicative. But, let me elaborate a little better. First of all, I am using strongMongoidstrong, a Gem for using MongoDB with rails applications.p  p1 I have a large collection, which has information about a map. A map embeds a lot of tiles, and each tile references a terrain collection, a user collection, and has some other information. Therefore, if I obtain all tiles from a map, I will have a really large structure. However, I would like to cache a structure that comprises a matrix with only the terrain information. In order to do that, I select all tiles and hence, all their unneeded information and use only the terrain field. How can I select ONLY the terrain field on Mongoid I tried operating with select on several ways, but I did not manage to do it.. by the way, just for the sake of exemplification, I access the tiles array with the line Map.first.tiles.p  p2 Well.. I am already here, so, why not ask this. Should I really use the inverseof fields on my Models I did not use it anywhere, and everything seems to be working perfectly. I do not see why it is needed, as it is pretty much straight forward to determine where to put them, and what they are the inverse of.p  pThanks in advance. Fernando.p

Negative 10593 pGreetings each and all.p  pIve been struggling with OpenGL ES 2.0 and a particular problem for the last few days now. Im looking to implement a Geometry Wars clone, for the iPhone, for fun and to learn this technology. So, my background in 3d programming is fairly good, although mainly concentrated around vector mathematics rather then draw calls towards the graphical API, as Ive been working with DirectX on and off for the last couple of years. The problem, however, is that Ive mainly been working with bigger meshes, loading, translating and transforming them in several ways and now I find myself in a position where I want to handle small meshes, and lots of them.p  pThe objects are triangles, rectangles, hexagons etc. and I want the ability to modify them all separately eg making the other edge wavy or pulsating. When Ive worked with multiple big meshes Ive made separate draw calls for them, easily attaching shaders and their respective parameters, but in this case I would like to render it all in one call and theres where my knowledge fails me.p  pSo, to clearify my question. How are you to modify small meshes, preferably stored in one vertex array, individually and render them all at once using shaders with OpenGL ES 2.0p  pAlthough code examples are more then welcome, a simple explanation would be enough to get me started. I assume Im missing something trivial here and any help is greatly appreciated.p  pThanks in advance,p  pKarlp

Negative 10593 pIm trying to mirror a website for content, unfortunately large chunks of it is javascript based, including code that generates hrefs.  That wipes out most standard web scraping tools like httrack as their attempts at processing javascript, if they even do attempt it, are highly unreliable.p  pSo I decided to write my own in python and get the webkit engine to process the HTML.  The procedural logic seems pretty straight forward, generate a dict with urls found as the key and the value being 0 or 1 based on whether or not its already been processed.  I managed to get the base logic to work reasonably well with pyqt4 but it kept segfaulting at random times, enough to make me distrust it, and then I found this  a hrefhttpblog.motane.lu20090618pywebkitgtkexecutejavascriptfrompython relnofollowhttpblog.motane.lu20090618pywebkitgtkexecutejavascriptfrompythonap  pNeat script, it works, but Ive never dealt with gtk in python before.  Bolting my logic around it was fairly straightforward though, however its proving to be a bit of a memory hog.  Profiling it with meliae shows nothing taking up that much memory, even as python is reaching 2Gb.  The site has a fair few pages and the script eventually reaches the 32bit memory limit and segfaults.  My assumption is that the code is spawning more and more webkit windows.  Im at a loss how to get it to actually close or destroy those windows.  Ive tried destroy, there is a mainquit in there, nothing seems to be closing it.p  pHeres what should be the relevant parts I hope, but with destination url changed.  I was using dicts for url and foundurl but switched to anydbm in case they were for some bizarre reason the memory hog.  Ill probably be switching back to dicts at some pointp  precodeusrbinenv python import sys, thread import gtk import webkit import warnings from time import sleep from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup import re import os import anydbm import copy from meliae import scanner  warnings.filterwarningsignore  class WebViewwebkit.WebView     def gethtmlself         self.executescriptoldtitledocument.titledocument.titledocument.documentElement.innerHTML         html  self.getmainframe.gettitle         self.executescriptdocument.titleoldtitle         self.destroy         return html  class Crawlergtk.Window     def initself, url, file         gtk.gdk.threadsinit  suggested by Nicholas Herriot for Ubuntu Koala         gtk.Window.initself         self.url  url         self.file  file         self.connectdestroy,gtk.mainquit      def crawlself         view  WebView         view.openself.url         view.connectloadfinished, self.finishedloading         self.addview         gtk.main         return view.gethtml      def finishedloadingself, view, frame         with openself.file, w as f             f.writeview.gethtml         gtk.mainquit codepre  p..Various subroutines that just handle the BeautifulSoup end of things, processing the pages, pulling out links, tidying them up etc...p  precodedef main     urlsanydbm.open.urls,n     domain  stackoverflow.com     baseUrl  httpdomain     urls[]0     while checkdoneurls  0         count  0         foundurlsanydbm.open.foundurls,n         for url, done in urls.iteritems             if done  1 continue             print Processing,url             urls[strurl]  1             if re.search.,url                 outfiledomainurlindex.html             elif os.path.isdiros.path.dirnameos.path.abspathoutfile                 outfiledomainurlindex.html             else                 outfiledomainurl             if not os.path.existsos.path.dirnameos.path.abspathoutfile                 os.makedirsos.path.dirnameos.path.abspathoutfile             crawler  CrawlerbaseUrlurl, outfile             htmlcrawler.crawl             soup  BeautifulSouphtml.str             for link in hrefssoup,baseUrl                 if not foundurls.haskeystrlink                     foundurls[strlink]  0             delhtml     this is an attempt to get the object to vanish, tried delCrawler to no avail             if count5                 scanner.dumpallobjects filename                  count  0             else                 countcount1         for url, done in foundurls.iteritems             if not urls.haskeystrurl                 urls[strurl]0         foundurls.close         os.remove.foundurls     urls.close     os.remove.urls  if name  main     main codepre

Negative 10593 pAmazons EC2 service offers a variety of Linux and Windows OS choices, but I havent found a service offering a similar rent by the hour service for a remote Mac OS X virtual machine.  Does such a service exist  iCloud looks to be just a data storage service, rather than a service allowing remote login, etc.p  pSuch a virtual machine service would be very useful for testing software in a reproducible, neutral location.p  hr  pUpdate 1 Just to be clear, Im referring to services similar to EC2s ondemand or spot instances, where the machine or virtual machine is rented per hour, rather than typical web hosting services that involve a monthly subscription.  As Erik has pointed out, there are several good options for that route.  As my searches for queries for OS X hosting with terms like per hour or hourly rates are turning up very little basically, just labor fees for hourly repairs, I am inclined to believe that this doesnt exist for some reason.

Negative 10593 pSo I am working with a hardware device that utilizes A2DP, HFP, AVRCP, and SPP. The problem I am getting seems to be only on some phones but I want to resolve it.p  pWhile connecting the hardware device through Android pair.connect everything works fine. If I go into a default music player it streams correctly as well as AVRCP commands working. p  pHowever, in the app I am working on I use SPP.

Negative 10593 pI have a component that is used widely throughout my application code base i.e.  multiple applications.  I want to change one of the commonly used event handler properties.  I need a toolutility that would go through a Delphi 6 form source file DFM  PAS and do a search and replace for the currently defined event handlers for instances of the component on the form.p  pFor example.

When would this change Only on server restarts How do I test this behavior  I cant just set the config, the model file wont be read again.p  pPlease advise.p
Negative 10593 pIm working with a team that have had problems with random failing tests. The failing tests seemingly only failed on the buildserver TFS. But as I investigated the problem I was able to have them fail on my local machine as well.p  pIt seems that I have fixed the problem, but I need confirmation of my theory about the failing tests.p  pOne of the tests that failed had this TestInitialize methodp  precode    [TestInitialize]     public void TestInit              MockltILoggt loqMock  new MockltILoggt         Depend.RegisterInstanceloqMock.Object      codepre  pThe Depend class is a static wrapper around the Unity container. It has a local reference to the Unity container inside it. Some tests in this fixture fails seemingly at random.p  pMy theory is that the logMock variable is dereferenced, since there is no reference to either that or the Depend class after the Initialize method returns.p  pI fixed the problem by changing the code to thisp  precode    private MockltILoggt loqMock      [TestInitialize]     public void TestInit              loqMock  new MockltILoggt         Depend.RegisterInstanceloqMock.Object      codepre  pNow the logMock variable is referenced as long as the testfixture lives. I cannot get it to fail, as I could with the other setup.p  pPS I know that this use of an IOC container is a really bad idea and that it should be changed, but the project Im consulting, doesnt have the resources to make the change, and theres nothing I can do about it.p

Negative 10593 pIm installing Debian linux commandlineonly onto a flash drive for portability, and Id like some direction if you can offer it.

pI apologise if I gave too much information, but I thought if I gave all this information it would make things easier on people that want to help me out. I have spent a good 3 hours making adjustments to the DDL script but after spending that long I realised I need someone with more experience to help me. Ive showed the logical model to someone with industry experience in databases and they believe it conforms to 3NF. Doing the conceptual and logical models wasnt so bad for myself, it was trying to convert the logical model to working script and successfully inserting data I want to insert at least 10 records for each table that has become the biggest hurdle.p  pThanks in advancep

A player in this case, the human chooses one person among many possible ones, and the other player the computer starts asking yesno questions about some attributes of the person. Eventually, with the given answers, there will only be one possible person.p  pSo far, Ive been able to make a set of rules and predicates so that the computer can guess the person based on the questions that have been asked so far. I have a set of suspects  those are the people that, with the available clues, could fit.p  precodesuspectPerson 1  eyesblue , ageold , gendermale. codepre  pThe predicates for the attributes are defined so that they will be true either if the question regarding that attribute has not been asked yet, or if the question has been asked and the answer matches the attribute of the suspect.p  precodegenderX  notaskedgender  valueofgender, X. codepre  pThat way, if two suspects share the same eyes and age and different gender, as long as the gender remains unasked, both of them will be plausible suspects.p  pHowever, the hard part now is to automate the process of asking those questions. Basically, Im looking forward to a solution where Prolog were able to get the possible values for the attributes from the suspects predicates, instead of listing theme somewhere else. Im pretty sure there must be a way of doing this, given prolog is able to use the programs code as data itself.p  pHow could I do that p

Negative 10593 pIve been wondering how much memory does an Object occupy on Android. There are numerous resources like a hrefhttpkohlerm.blogspot.com200812howmuchmemoryisusedbymyjava.htmlthisa related to HotSpot JVM telling that an empty object takes 8 bytes and an empty array 12 bytes and that all objects are aligned to 8 byte boundary. Thus an object with no extra fields should take 8 bytes, the smallest object with at least one extra field  16 bytes, an empty array  16 bytes, rightp  pIve found no specific information about Dalvik on this matter and decided to figure it out by testing. Running the test had strongsurprising resultsstrong.p  pFew words about the method of calculation. Androids implementation of Object.hashCode simply returns the pointer to the object casted to int. seemed obvious and general, but [another surprise] as it turned out, it does NOT on HotSpot JVM for instance  run MemTest with HotSpot and see. So, Ive used the simplicity of hashCode on Dalvik to calculate the object size on Android by allocating two instances of the tested class in a row and the amount of the allocated space should be equal to the difference of their hashCode values assuming that it makes little sense for Dalvik to allocate those at completely random addresses. Just to be sure Ive allocated always 4 objects in a row per test class, which delivered always the same difference of hashCode. So, I believe there is little doubt about correctness of the method.p  pHere is the source code of the testp  precodepublic class MemTest      public static void run          Object o1  new Object

If it is correct then navigate to the menu.php page else if login is incorrect, display a message stating log in is incorrect, try again.p  pInstead what the code below is doing is that when the user enters in their username and password and clicks on Login button, no matter if username and password is correct or not it just refreshes the from, it doesnt navigate to menu.php page or display a login incorrect message.p  pSo my question is that why is this happening, why after logging in does it not navigate the user or display the incorrect login messagep  pBelow is the codep  precode ltphp      sessionstart       usernamexxx     passwordxxx     databasexxx      mysqli  new mysqlilocalhost, username, password, databaseor die Unable to select database      foreach arrayteacherusername,teacherpassword as varname              varname  issetPOST[varname]  POST[varname]                   gt      ltform actionltphp echo htmlentitiesSERVER[PHPSELF] gt methodpost idteachLoginFormgt             ltpgtUsernameltpgtltpgtltinput typetext nameteacherusername gtltpgt      lt Enter Teacher Usernamegt     ltpgtPasswordltpgtltpgtltinput typepassword nameteacherpassword gtltpgt  lt Enter Teacher Passwordgt      ltpgtltinput idloginSubmit typesubmit valueLogin namesubmit gtltpgt     ltformgt      ltphp     if issetPOST[submit]       query  mysqligtprepare     SELECT  FROM Teacher t       WHERE      t.TeacherUsername  .mysqlirealescapestringteacherusername.

Negative 10593 pI have a large system in Java, which basicaly consists of an user interface, the core engine of the application and a lot of other modules. I am trying to create an applet that will consist only of the core engine, without the other parts, so I need to share the same codebase to keep up with the updates. Ive done this and it works well, the problem is that there are a lot of external jars used in the other parts that I dont need, and the applet currently requires them all.p  pI dont call the part of the code that needs the external jar and the stack trace gives me an error when I am calling a constructor of a class, so what I am guessing is that it requires the jars as soon as this class that Im using the constructor is loaded. But Ive read on the internet that Java only loads classes when required, so Im not sure what is going on here. Could anybody give me some advice about how can I make it not need these jarsp  pPS Im sure the best approach would be to refactor it, separating the functionality into clear layers, so I could tackle this more easily. The problem is that this is a very old and big codebase and doing this kind of massrefactoring although I would like to is not viable right now.p  pEdit  adding one of the stack traces and more informationp  precodejava.io.FileNotFoundException httplocalhost3000appletjess.jar     at sun.net.www.protocol.http.HttpURLConnection.getInputStreamUnknown Source     at com.sun.deploy.net.DownloadEngine.getJarFileWithoutCacheUnknown Source     at com.sun.deploy.net.DownloadEngine.downloadJarFileWithoutCacheUnknown Source     at sun.plugin.PluginURLJarFileCallBack1.runUnknown Source     at java.security.AccessController.doPrivilegedNative Method     at sun.plugin.PluginURLJarFileCallBack.retrieveUnknown Source     at sun.net.www.protocol.jar.URLJarFile.retrieveUnknown Source     at sun.net.www.protocol.jar.URLJarFile.getJarFileUnknown Source     at sun.net.www.protocol.jar.JarFileFactory.getUnknown Source     at sun.net.www.protocol.jar.JarURLConnection.connectUnknown Source     at sun.plugin.net.protocol.jar.CachedJarURLConnection.connectUnknown Source     at sun.plugin.net.protocol.jar.CachedJarURLConnection.getJarFileInternalUnknown Source     at sun.plugin.net.protocol.jar.CachedJarURLConnection.getJarFileUnknown Source     at com.sun.deploy.security.DeployURLClassPathJarLoader.getJarFileUnknown Source     at com.sun.deploy.security.DeployURLClassPathJarLoader.access1000Unknown Source     at com.sun.deploy.security.DeployURLClassPathJarLoader1.runUnknown Source     at java.security.AccessController.doPrivilegedNative Method     at com.sun.deploy.security.DeployURLClassPathJarLoader.ensureOpenUnknown Source     at com.sun.deploy.security.DeployURLClassPathJarLoader.ltinitgtUnknown Source     at com.sun.deploy.security.DeployURLClassPath3.runUnknown Source     at java.security.AccessController.doPrivilegedNative Method     at com.sun.deploy.security.DeployURLClassPath.getLoaderUnknown Source     at com.sun.deploy.security.DeployURLClassPath.getLoaderUnknown Source     at com.sun.deploy.security.DeployURLClassPath.getResourceUnknown Source     at sun.plugin2.applet.Plugin2ClassLoader2.runUnknown Source     at java.security.AccessController.doPrivilegedNative Method     at sun.plugin2.applet.Plugin2ClassLoader.findClassHelperUnknown Source     at sun.plugin2.applet.Applet2ClassLoader.findClassUnknown Source     at sun.plugin2.applet.Plugin2ClassLoader.loadClass0Unknown Source     at sun.plugin2.applet.Plugin2ClassLoader.loadClassUnknown Source     at sun.plugin2.applet.Plugin2ClassLoader.loadClassUnknown Source     at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClassUnknown Source     at my.package.MyClass.ltinitgtMyClass.java187     at my.package.MyApplet.startMyApplet.java38     at com.sun.deploy.uitoolkit.impl.awt.AWTAppletAdapter.startUnknown Source     at sun.plugin2.applet.Plugin2ManagerAppletExecutionRunnable.runUnknown Source     at java.lang.Thread.runUnknown Source codepre  pMyClass line 187 is just MyClass2 obj  new MyClass2p  pAll other FileNotFoundException traces are identical, but missing other files.

Negative 10593 pThis question has pertinence beyond my own case because anyone who has a localized application and has to deliver a standalone EXE has this problem they will want to use ILMerge or Costura or some homebrew solution to put localization DLLs or any other assembly into their EXE but once they do that, they can no longer debug their code.  The VS debugger will just refuse to accept the original PDB file generated for the original EXE, presumably because the ILMerge step either updates the checksum or changes the GUID.p  pWhat I wonder is if theres any way around this.. like some little known ILMerge option, maybe  It strikes me as a very common and unnecessary loss of debugging ability.p  pI believe the only other way to debug such an app after localization is to maintain a parallel build option that uses the DLLs unILMerged, which is fine, unless you happen to want to debug the localization code itself for example, me.. then youre really out of luck.  Can anyone think of other optionsp  pI also tried using Costura, but because localization DLLs all contain resources that are identically named and are identical to the main resource AppName.resource, you can only add one such DLL to the References subsequent ones are not allowed.  Is there some way to gimmick Costura into working if it could be made to work though, the PDB problem might not occur as the combination is part of the the visual studio build..p  pEdit Im looking for ideas that result in a PDBEXE match.  I realize you can hack the pdb in a hex editor.  The question specifically asks about ways to make the system work as intended, though.p

Negative 10593 pMy aim is to have 3 images shrink, grow, and move along a horizontal axis depending on selection. Using Auto Layout seems to make the images jump about as they try to fulfil the Top space to superview  Bottom space to superview constraints. p  pSo to combat this I have put all the images inside their own UIView. The UIView is set to the maximum size the images can grow to, it is centred on the horizontal axis. So now all the images must do is stay centred inside their corresponding UIView. This has fixed my problem as the UIViews perform the horizontal translation, while the images shrinkgrow inside while remaining centred. My question is  is this the correct way to do this It seems very long and like I am perhaps misusing the ability of Auto Layout. I have to perform similar tasks with more images and so any advice is welcome Thanks. p

Negative 10593 pI have a class which contains a static member obj.  The static class member obj itself contains a static member which happens to be a mutex type of class.p  pNow when my program terminates it is crashes.  This happens when static object obj gets destructed.  The destructor of obj calls its static member my own mutex type following RAII idiom to destruct the underlying low level objects.  Unfortunatly this member happened to be destroyed already since initialization order  the opposite destructor order of static objects is undefined.p  pHow to survive from this cleanly  I am surpriced this has not happened more often.  Looks like it is quite dangerous to have static nonPOD members in general. Escpecially if you do not know their inner structure well.p

Negative 10593 pWe have a path defined which we would like to render in several hundred different positions during the OnRender override.  We know about the PushTransform method on the DC, but that seems to require a new TranslateTransform instance for each render, which means we end up with hundreds of TranslateTransform as well. That just doesnt seem efficient.p  pWeve also tried a single TranslateTransform, then just changing its X and Y locations with each render, but since WPF actually caches the drawing instructions and not the actual drawing, when its finally time to render, they all render in the same location because they are sharing the same TranslateTransform using its lastset offsets.p  pSo whats the best way to achieve thisp

Negative 10593 pI have a highperformance application Im considering making distributed using rabbitMQ as the MQ. The application uses a database currently SQLServer, but I can still switch to something else and caches most of it in the RAM to increase performance. This causes a problem because when one of the applications writes to the database, the others cached database becomes outofdate.p  pI figured it is something that happens a lot in the HighAvailability community, however I couldnt find anything useful. I guess Im not searching for the right thing. Is there an outofthebox solutionp  pPS Im sorry if this belongs to serverfault  Since this a development issue I figured it belongs herep  pEDIT The application reads and writes to the database. Since Im changing the application to be distributed  Now more than one application reads and writes to the database. The caching is done in each of the distributed applications, which are not aware to DB changes from another application. I mean  How can one know if the DB was updated, if he wasnt the one to update itp
Negative 10593 pOk so I have this interesting ASP.NET MVC 4 solutionproject structure, which creates pluggable application modules. I created it following this techniquep  pa hrefhttpgeekswithblogs.netcokobwarearchive20130115asp.netmvc4pluggableapplicationmodules.aspx relnofollowhttpgeekswithblogs.netcokobwarearchive20130115asp.netmvc4pluggableapplicationmodules.aspxap  pAs a result, I have a main application with an empty Areas folder in the project. I also have a Plugin project that resides in the Areas folder of the main application on disk, and it also sets its build output folder to the main application codebincode folder.p  pIn my pluggable module application, I decided to create an Areas section within it, and created an Area called Test. By default, the ASP.NET MVC 4 view engine doesnt support it as a pluggable module because it tries to look for the View in the incorrect location. p  pSo conceptually, we havep  precodeMain             lt Main application folder    Areas         lt Main application folder       Plugin     lt Plugin module application folder          Areas   lt Plugin module application folder             Test lt Plugin module application folder codepre  pTo fix this, I created a way to interpret the codeAreaNamecode property in a customized codeRazorViewEnginecode class to rewrite the URL the view engine is looking for to find the view files in these pluggable module areas.p  pFirst, I use the following convention to define my Area registration class for the Test Area belonging to my pluggable modulesp  precodeNamespace Areas.Plugin     Public Class PluginAreaRegistration         Inherits AreaRegistration          Public Overrides ReadOnly Property AreaName As String             Get                 Return Plugin.Test             End Get         End Property          Public Overrides Sub RegisterAreaByVal context As System.Web.Mvc.AreaRegistrationContext             context.MapRoute                  Plugindefault,                 PluginTestcontrolleractionid,                  New With .controller  Home, .action  Index, .id  UrlParameter.Optional,                 Plugin.Test.Controllers                      End Sub     End Class End Namespace codepre  pI then inherited the the codeRazorViewEnginecode and overrode some methods to parse and generate the views path in the pluggable modules Areas folderp  precodePublic Class MyExtendedRazorViewEngine Inherits RazorViewEngine   set the location format strings Public Sub New     MyBase.PartialViewLocationFormats                    Views10.cshtml,         Views10.vbhtml,         Areas2Views10.cshtml,         Areas2Views10.vbhtml,         ViewsShared0.cshtml,         ViewsShared0.vbhtml,         Areas3Areas2Views10.cshtml,         Areas3Areas2Views10.vbhtml,         Areas1ViewsShared0.cshtml,         Areas1ViewsShared0.vbhtml,         Areas2Areas1Views0.cshtml,         Areas2Areas1Views0.vbhtml               MyBase.AreaViewLocationFormats           Areas2Views10.cshtml,         Areas2Views10.vbhtml,         Areas2ViewsShared0.cshtml,         Areas2ViewsShared0.vbhtml,         Areas2Areas1Views0.cshtml,         Areas2Areas1Views0.vbhtml           MyBase.AreaMasterLocationFormats           Areas2Views10.cshtml,         Areas2Views10.vbhtml,         Areas2ViewsShared0.cshtml,         Areas2ViewsShared0.vbhtml,         Areas2Areas1Views0.cshtml,         Areas2Areas1Views0.vbhtml           MyBase.AreaPartialViewLocationFormats           Areas2Views10.cshtml,         Areas2Views10.vbhtml,         Areas2ViewsShared0.cshtml,         Areas2ViewsShared0.vbhtml,         Areas2Areas1Views0.cshtml,         Areas2Areas1Views0.vbhtml           MyBase.ViewLocationFormats           Views10.cshtml,         Views10.vbhtml,         ViewsShared0.cshtml,         ViewsShared0.vbhtml           MyBase.MasterLocationFormats           Views10.cshtml,         Views10.vbhtml,         ViewsShared0.cshtml,         ViewsShared0.vbhtml           MyBase.PartialViewLocationFormats           Views10.cshtml,         Views10.vbhtml,         ViewsShared0.cshtml,         ViewsShared0.vbhtml       End Sub  Protected Overrides Function CreatePartialViewcontrollerContext As ControllerContext, partialPath As String As IView      Dim area As String  controllerContext.RouteData.DataTokens.ItemArea     Dim areaname As String     Dim pp As String  partialPath      If Not area Is Nothing Then         areaname  area.Split.

Negative 10593 pIm currently making a small library which can access random.org and get random strings or integers.

Negative 10593 pI am relatively new to development so please correct me when digressing.  I have Flex 4.6 web application as front end for an application and a SQL Server 2008 R2 as the database on an IIS server. Currently it needs to be used over LAN but has to have the capability to be transferred over the Web. I needs a solution for the Flex web application to connect to the DB without making direct calls from the clients. To avoid that I thought of putting in a interface using the either SOAP or Web API using ASP.NET. Problem is MVC though a solid architecture is too complex for my needs and a lot of work in case of modifications.  My question is is Web API dependent on the usage of MVC for it to be implemented or can plain ASP.NET work If it does work on ASP.NET do I still need to create models and controllers in the plain ASP.NET project If I decide for an authentication, what approaches are available that I can look into that will be efficient Any other solutions or suggestions are welcome.p
Negative 10593 pI am having some trouble with a simple camel route that should be grabbing a message from an ActiveMQ topic that I have and then printing out the contents of the messages to the console through the use of log. p  pRight now all that it is is the camelcontext.xml, and a java class that is producing the topic in ActiveMQ and adding a simple string message to the queue.

Negative 10593 pI was reading through the a hrefhttpen.cppreference.comwcppthreadthreadthreadstdthread documentation at cppreferencea not always 100 accurate, I know and noticed the following definition for the behavior of codestdthreadcode when passed a pointertodatamember not pointertomemberfunction as its first argument codefcode and an object of the required class as its second argument codet1code after copying to threadlocalstoragep  blockquote   pIf N  1 and f is pointer to a member data object of a class, then it is accessed. The value of the object is ignored. Effectively, the following code is executed   t1.f if and the type of t1 is either T, reference to T or reference to type derived from T.   t1.f otherwise.p blockquote  pNow, I dont plan on using codestdthreadcode in this way, but I am flummoxed by this definition. Apparently, the only thing that happens is that the data member is accessed and the value ignored, which doesnt seem like it could have any observable sideeffects at all, meaning as far I can tell it might as well be a noop. I might be missing something obvious...p  pAt first, I thought this might be a misprint, and meant to say that the data member is accessed and then called since it might be a callable object, even if its not a function but I tested it with the following code in GCC4.7 and indeed there is no callp  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltthreadgt  struct S       void f          stdcout ltlt Calling f ltlt stdendl           struct          void operator              stdcout ltlt Calling g ltlt stdendl               g   int mainint, char      S s     s.f  prints Calling f     s.g  prints Calling g      stdcout ltlt  ltlt stdendl      auto x  ampSf  ptrtomemfunc     auto y  ampSg  ptrtodatamem      s.x  prints Calling f     s.y  prints Calling g      stdcout ltlt  ltlt stdendl      stdthread tx, amps     t.join      Calling f printed by now     stdthread uy, amps     u.join      Calling g not printed      return 0  codepre  pIs there any purpose to this definition which doesnt seem to accomplish anything Why not instead make passing a pointertodatamembercallable act just like a pointertomemberfunction, and make passing a pointertodatamembernoncallable an error In fact, it seems like this would be the easiest way to implement it, since calling a pointertodatamembercallable has equivalent syntax to calling as a pointertomemberfunction in other contexts unless theres something in the vagarities of template specialization and SFINAE rules which makes it difficult to treat them equivalently...p  pThis is not something I need for actual code, but the fact that this definition exists leaves me suspecting that I am missing something fundamental, which worries me...can anyone enlighten me about thisp

Negative 10593 pI have an strongSSRS reportstrong that employs strongRowGroupsstrong to group data. One of the fields used in the group is a field that stores a URL as text.

Negative 10593 pIve built my entity model in a separate C class library project than my web project. In my separate class library project I created some simple classes that are representations of the entity classes for passing to the client through AJAX. In the simple objects I create the context for querying the database. When I call methods in those classes from my web application, I cant seem I keep getting errors. At first it was because I had nothing in my web.config file referencing the connection string from the project with the entity model. I copied the three tags from the app.config file to my web.config file but now I see an error Keyword not supported metadata when trying to query the database.p  pOne thing Im not sure about is where to create the context. Should that be done in the web project then passed to methods in the class library project When I try this approach I get the following errorp  blockquote   perror CS0012 The type System.Data.Entity.DbContext is defined in an assembly that is not referenced. You must add a reference to assembly EntityFramework, Version5.0.0.0, Cultureneutral, PublicKeyTokenb77a5c561934e089.p blockquote  pIf I create the context in the class library project, when running the application and trying to query the database I get the keyword not supported metadata error. So Im not sure where to go here. What am I doing wrong Ive spent hours searching for an answer but there are so much info out there I couldnt find anything specific to this.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 10593 pIm writing a browser extension that inserts a banner on top of every page that the user visits. The banner must not be sticky and must not block any existing content. a hrefhttpschrome.google.comwebstoredetailawesomefactsbjkhdklfbghoadcamlpmkafgmehcmima relnofollowmy chrome extensionap  pCurrently Im doing this by adding the banner content to the DOM through the following javascript in a contentscript that is inserted on every pagep  precodecontent  ltdiv idlbbannergtblah blahltdivgt htmlfirst.addClasslbbanneradded.prependcontent codepre  pIm adding the content before body so that the banner is not affected by how the site is styled. Then, in order to push the main content of the page down while not affecting any potential site layout, Im using the following stylesp  precodehtml.lbbanneradded     position relative    margintop 32px  lbbanner     height 32px    width 100    position absolute    top 32px    display none    ... other styles...  .lbbanneradded lbbanner  display block  codepre  pThis pushes the whole html down while the banner is absolutely positioned to fill in the empty space in this case 32px.p  pI have tried other methods to add the banner on top of every page. However this method is compatible with the most sites so far even many of those with sticky headers.p  pHowever this is definitely not the best solution as I cannot get it working on facebook, twitter, linkedin works but is blocking some content, gmailgcalendargdoc works but caused some contents to be moved outside of the window, and many more. Furthermore, this method requires me to specify the height of the content, which is okay for now but I would prefer a more dynamic method.p  hr  pstrongNotesstrongp  pWithout the styling I showed above, the banner would still appear on top of every page. However doing so will also break layout on many sites such as google.com. For example on Google, the banner will just cover the black nav bar and there will be extra spacing right before the search results.p  pHeres the chrome extension that is in question a hrefhttpschrome.google.comwebstoredetailawesomefactsbjkhdklfbghoadcamlpmkafgmehcmima relnofollowhttpschrome.google.comwebstoredetailawesomefactsbjkhdklfbghoadcamlpmkafgmehcmimaap

precodeExample Four Panel Contour Plot with One Legend Author Carey R McGilliard September 2010  This code uses a modified version of filled.contour called filled.contour3 created by Carey McGilliard, Ian Taylor, and Bridget Ferris to make an example figure of four contour plots sharing a legend to the right. The example demonstrates how to use various color schemes for the contour plots and legend, but the user will want to pick one color scheme for all four plots such that the legend matches the plots. Changing the x and yaxis values will change the placement of text added to the figure using the text function and adjustments will be necessary   Source the following functions change the paths as

Ignore the blue rectangle, that was me having it selected in the F12 tools img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comtWVVz.png altBrands workingp  pAnd this shot shows what happens in IE9. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comMcLbW.png altBrands not workingp  pNow this only happens if the plugin is called, if its not then they line up as in the first shot albeit in the full colour version. Ever more annoying is that I have no idea how to start debugging it, because as soon as you do hover over one of the brands it corrects itselfp  pLooking at the css that the horrible IE F12 tools gives you shows no difference before or after the hover. but something is going onp  pSo, any ideas on how I could start to debug this, or an answer as to what it going on Below is the scriptp  precodefunction   .fn.hoverizr  function settings      var defaults                      Is the image tag wrapped in a link           If it is we will apply the effect on the           link becoming

                 effect    grayscale,                    How should we show the canvas element           top            Show canvased element by default            Show original image upon hover           bottom            Show original element by default            Show canvased element upon hover                   overlay   top,                    What class should we give the container           The container is created and wraps the           new canvas and image element                   container overlayed,                    What class should we give the canvas                   canvas    canv,                    What width should we give the canvas           Also affects the original image                   width     responsive,                    What height should we give the canvas element           Also affects the original image                   height    auto,                    Should we allow the container to stretch to fill           all available space                   stretch   no,                    How fast should the switch in be                   speedIn   slow,                    How fast should the switch out be                   speedOut  fast                  Merge the defaults and the new settings together to give us       the user options           var options  .extenddefaults, settings      this.eachfunction            var containerOffset         var

image.parent                       We wrap everything in .load because we cannot           access the image data if its not loaded yet                    image.loadfunction                                Sets the maxwidth of the image               Also, lets store a flag to say whether we               changed it or not                           var maxWidthSet  false             if

       and the image, then we know how to properly position               the canvas element                            containerOffset  container.offset             imageOffset  image.offset

               Lets store the image dimensions too, we will need to               give those to the canvas element                           var dimensions                   height image.height,                 width  image.width                          canvas.propdimensions                             We need the container to be relative so when we position               the canvas it is relative to the container                           container.cssposition, relative                             Now we position the canvas so it should exactly cover the image                           canvas.cssposition absolute, top position.top, left position.left, zindex 10, display block                             Now lets set the Zindex so it sits in the right zplane               relative to the canvas               Also, if the canvas is meant to be displayed only on hover               We might want to hide that too                           if options.overlay  top

While doing this, I realized that nothing was stopping me from instantiating this codeResourceManagercode class. This led me to tag it with the codeabstractcode keyword.p  pIve never used codeabstractcode in this way before Ive only ever applied it more conventionally for an inheritance tree.

But when reflecting and using the method hasMethod I doesnt have the method foo.p  pWhats the right way to see if somewhere in the inheritance tree the method is therep  pMy problem lays within checking for the constructor. Some children dont implement a construct method and I was expecting the construct method to be reflect by inheritance.p  pThanks in advance  p
Negative 10593 psorry if this might be a cheesy question, but unfortunately I cannot change the project setup.  I have a form on a php page, which is supposed to post some text fields and a file input to a MVC Controller Action. The posting part works, and I successfully receive the text data in my ViewModel. However, I have no idea how tto receive the file image, will be either jpg or png. The ID and NAME of the input type file is UserIcon.p  pIn the ActionResult I tried it with HttpPostedFileBase like thisp  precodepublic virtual ActionResult RegisterJsonRegistrationModels model, HttpPostedFileBase UserIcon codepre  pBut UserIcon is always NULL. Instead, if I have the file as part of the codeRegistrationModelscode Modelp  precode    [DisplayNameIhr Foto]     public string UserIcon  get set     codepre  pI receive the curl path codeCWindowsTempphpA03D.tmpfilenamePenguins.jpgcode as string.p  pBut from here I have absolutely no clue as to what I have to do next to save the file. I tried to add to the curl header the codeheader  arrayContenttype multipartformdatacode but then all the posted form fields are NULL. p  pId be so grateful if anyone could point me in the right direction I think Im having a main blackout here and doing something completely wrong Sp  pThis is the curl code which posts to the MVC Actionp  precode    postargs  array     foreach FILES as param gt file          postargs[param]   . file[tmpname] . filename . file[name] .           fieldsstring       urlify the data for the POST     foreachPOST as keygtvalue          fieldsstring . key..value.amp           fieldsstring . httpbuildquerypostargs      ch  curlinit      curlsetoptch,CURLOPTURL,url     curlsetoptch,CURLOPTPOST,countPOST     curlsetoptch,CURLOPTPOSTFIELDS,fieldsstring      result  curlexecch      curlclosech codepre  pThanks alotp  pCheers, Carolinep

Negative 10593 pif you want to cut to the chase, please skip down to the last two paragraphs. If youre interested in my predicament and the steps Ive taken to solve it, continue reading directly below.p  pI am currently developing portions of a C library as part of my internship. So naturally, there are some parts of code which should not be accessible to the user while others should be. I am basically developing several architectureoptimized random number generators RNGsuniform, Gaussian, and exponential distributed numbers. The latter two RNGs depend on the uniform generator , which is in a different kernel project. So, in the case that the user wants to use more than one RNG, I want to make sure Im not duplicating code needlessly since we are constrained with memory no point in having the same function defined multiple times at different addresses in the code segment.p  pNow heres where the problem arises. The convention for all other kernels in the library is that we have a two header files and two C files one each for the natural C implementation and the optimized C version which may use some intrinsic functions and assembly andor have some restrictions to make it faster and better for our architecture. This is followed by another C file a testbench where our main function is located and it tests both implementations and compares the results. With that said, we cannot really add an additional header file for private or protected items nor can we add a global header file for all these generators. p  pTo combat this restriction, I used strongexternstrong functions and strongextern const intstrongs in the C files which depend on the uniform RNG rather than strongdefinestrongs at the top of each C file in order to make the code more portable and easily modified in one place. This worked for the most part. p  pHowever, the tricky bit is that we are using an internal type within these kernels which should not be seen by the user and should not be placed in the header file. Again, for portability, I would like to be able to change the definition of this strongtypedefstrong in one place rather than in multiple places in multiple kernels since the library may be used for another platform later on and for the algorithms to work it is critical that I use 32bit types. p  pSo basically Im wondering if theres any way I can make a strongtypedefstrong protected in C. That is, I need it to be visible among all C files which need it, but invisible to the user. It can be in one of the header files, but must not be visible to the user who will be including that header file in hisher project, whatever that may be.p  pstrongemEditemstrong br I should also note that the typedef I am using is an unsigned int. sop  pstrongtypedef unsigned intstrong emmyTypeemp  pNo structures involved.p  pstrongemSuper Editemstrong br The use of stdint.h is also forbidden p
Negative 10593 pIm writing a module for Joomla. Its going to be displaying data that it gets through a SOAP request. The problem with the SOAP request is that it can take up to 5 seconds to retrieve the data. This Joomla module will be on a page with many other Joomla modules and other content. Im concerned that if this one Joomla module doing the SOAP request takes up to 5 seconds that it will delay loading the rest of the page. We have all been to websites which delay loading because of one part of the page and I dont want that to happen.p  pI am wondering if the solution is to have the Joomla module use AJAX which I have no experience with yet to do the SOAP request currently its being done with PHP and somehow allow the rest of the page to load while it might take up to 5 seconds for the SOAP request to return data so it can be displayed.p  pWhat is a good workable solution for this problem Caching the data isnt really an option because, its timely.

Negative 10593 pHere is the scenario that I am trying to implement There are some UI elements buttons that need to be disabledenabled basing on some validation rules. A button can depend on two or more validation rules. Also same validation rule can be bound to multiple buttons.  A rule evaluates to truefalse, but this depends on external factors and keeps on changing with time For example if the temperature is  100F the button needs to enabled, so the rule is to be hooked up with an interface which will send the input to rule the temperature basing on which the rule will set itself to true or false.p  pInitially I thought of using pubsub pattern with pull model where rules are the publishers and the UI elements are subscribers, when the rule changes its status i.e. true to false or viceversa the rule notifies its subscribers, and then the subscriber asks the rule for its statustrue or false and can enabledisable itself, but in this approach will not work if a button depends on two validation rules. In pubsub pattern can a subscriber maintain list of publishers it is tied up with, is this a good approach If my subscribers also maintain list of publishers, as soon as as it gets notification from a single publisher it will request status of all the publishers and then take decisions to enabledisable.p  pLet me know if this is a good approach for my scenario of if there is any other pattern that suits my scenario more.p  pThanks for going through my long post.p

Negative 10593 pI have a wpf custom control in AssemblyA that references a string resource from an resx file in an external assembly AssemblyB.p  precode    public override void OnApplyTemplate              try                      base.OnApplyTemplate               ...

Instead, the designer displays a nice big red cross with the message      FileNotFoundException Could not load file or assembly AssemblyB.  The AssemblyB was also added as a dll reference to AssemblyC.p  pRemoving the the references to the string resource in AssemblyA removes the error and allows the control to display correctly in the designer. Unfortunately, this is not an option as the string resources are used throughout the application for support reasons.p  pCreating an resx file in AssemblyA also removes the error but decentralises the resources which is not an option for on going development.p  pBased on the above, the designer is obviously not loading the resource assembly. Any insights would be appreciated.p  pTo Summarisep  pCustomControl in Assembly A in Solution 1 references a string resourced from a resx file in Assembly B in Solution 1. Assembly C in Solution 2 has a dll reference to both Assembly A and Assembly B. A UserControl in Assembly C uses CustomControl in Assembly A.

Negative 10593 pDo you have a problem understanding S3 IAM Policies and Directives   Cant quite wrap your head around their documentation  I did.  p  pI had a situation where I had to lock out several IAM users from a particular folder, and several buckets, except one, and most of their solutions and example solutions were about as clear as mud as far as I was concerned.

Mind you, you will not be able to block them from viewing the contents of the folder, nor will you block them from seeing that there are other buckets, that cant be helped.  However, they wont have access to the bucketfolder of your choice.  p

But I think we are supposed to make a class for all our data. I tried this and made them static and have the class abstract because I dont need to make copies of the class itself. p  pWhat I want to know is why dont people just make a list type that can do everything an arraylist and list can do in one, why is there different types What are the benifits of having different types Ps does a collection just mean a class for all your datap

Negative 10593 pI want to know what would be the best way to save objects to a file  Saving in the sense, the objects need to be appended.  When i searched the internet i found that printwriter saves an object in the format of its toString method, but then if it saves an object to a file in the toString format , how can the programer use it to access an instance in an object.  What i mean is, if i save a student object to a text file using printwriterThe object has a name, id and age , how can i use it in the future to compare the age of one student with another students age  search by id , etc.  Since the object is saved as a string , it can only be read as a string so how can i access the instances of an objectp  pThe other method i found out is serialization. Serialization looks like it does the job but then i found out that it cannot append objects to a file , because its stream header keeps on overriding. Is there a method to append objects to a file using serialization p  pCurrently these are the only 2 methods i found out for writing objects , but it seems i cannot use any of these methods since when saved using printwriter , it will be read as a string and if i use serialization i can store only one record.p  pThank you for your time.p

Negative 10593 pI am working with mysql database. I have a table of Person and I want one unique field for it to be a primary key so that one may search for a specific person in the db table, now consider this person table contains data of lost people in any disaster situation and we cannot select cnic or name as a primary key because in such situations cnic is impossible to search and name cannot be unique. Also later this table will be updated if that person is found and deleted too. Now my question is that, what to do with this situation, what should i do to handle this.p

Negative 10593 pOn my Mac OS X 10.8, Ive used the Apples OpenGL Profiler and as instructed on a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibrarymacdocumentationgraphicsimagingConceptualOpenGLProfilerUserGuideGettedStartedGettingStarted.html relnofollowApple docsa I set the GLENABLEDEBUGATTACH and loged outin. After setting that I immediately noticed that most apps that use OpenGL such as the browser became slower and thus I wanted to undo it.p  pThe problem is that even after removing the GLENABLEDEBUGATTACH from the .profile and from the .MacOSXenvironment.plist and restarting, it seems that the debug attach feature is still enabled somewhere, since the OpenGL Profiler does not present any error as it should if the GLENABLEDEBUGATTACH was not undefined. On the terminal, an echo GLENABLEDEBUGATTACH does not print anything.p  pDo I need to do anything else to disable OpenGL profilingp  pUpdate Another interesting finding is that when debugging with XCode, when I pause the execution of an OpenGL app there is an OGL Profiler thread in the threads list.p  pUpdate2 This does not happen on a new User on the same machine.p

Negative 10593 pI am using JPA in my project. Initially i havent any problem when i declared my entities without bidirectional relationship. because my requirement was like, we used jpa only for fetching the values from db. so, in design perspective we removed unwanted bidirectional fields. example strongEntity A has B as child but B havent Astrong.p  pThe second thing, we updated our code for requirement 2. it is persisting entities in database with UUID as a key. Since some of the tables related this UUID as a primary key. so i used codeGenerateValuecode and created a entity. it works for master table. but i not mapped to child table. strongthrowed cant not insert NULL exceptionstrong.p  pI googled and found a solution for this issue. Google said, using codeMapsIdcode will solve this issue. I used codeMapsIdcode. It dosent worked for me. Again googled and got a point that, if we use bidirectional relationship, then the codeMapsIdcode maps the UUID value. so, i introduced bidirectional with codeMapsIdcode and strongmappedbystrong attributes in codeOneToManycode. Then my entity got persist in the database.p  pNow my problem is, the requirement ones performance got down. because, due to my update bidirectional relationship each and every entity gives data from the database with bidirectional objects stronghuge numbersstrong  millions.p  precode My Code   Parent     mappedby  parent     PrimaryKeyJoinColumn     private SetltChildgt childs     Child     JoinColumnname  id     private Parent parent   codepre  pMy Questionsp  ul liHow to avoid parent object from child objects during fetchingli lipI will use child object for persisting but not for fetching. how to dop  pif i use parent.getChild, i need child values but, if i use parent.getChild.getParent i need null... how should i configpli ul  pThanks in advance.

To do that, I used this example from the cookbook  a hrefhttpsymfony.comdoccurrentcookbookformdynamicformmodification.htmlcookbookformeventssubmitteddatahttpsymfony.comdoccurrentcookbookformdynamicformmodification.htmlcookbookformeventssubmitteddataa p  pSo, here is my FormationType classp  precodeclass FormationType extends AbstractType   private em private context  public function constructem, context      thisgtem  em     thisgtcontext  context   public function buildFormFormBuilderInterface builder, array options      builder         gtaddname         gtadddate         gtaddtype, choice, array             mapped gt false,             choices gt FormationlistgetTypeTypesfalse,             emptyvalue gt false,                  gtaddcost         gtaddtravelCost         gtaddmaximum         gtaddlocation         gtaddschedule           formModifier  functionFormInterface form, type          formationList  thisgtemgtgetRepositoryCoreBundleFormationListgtfindByarrayyear gt 1, type gt type          formgtaddformationList, entity, array             labelgt Titre formation,              choices gt formationList,              class gt CoreBundleFormationList,              property gt title,                                  buildergtaddEventListener         FormEventsPRESETDATA,         functionFormEvent event use formModifier               data  eventgtgetForm             type  datagtgettypegtgetData              formModifiereventgtgetForm, type                     buildergtgettypegtaddEventListener         FormEventsPOSTSUBMIT,         functionFormEvent event use formModifier               type  eventgtgetFormgtgetData             formModifiereventgtgetFormgtgetParent, type                 public function setDefaultOptionsOptionsResolverInterface resolver      resolvergtsetDefaultsarray         dataclass gt EXAMPLECoreBundleEntityFormation        public function getName      return examplecorebundleformationtype   codepre  pSo, the two addEventListener work pretty well. The first time my form is displayed, the field in formModifier is not loaded, as expected. My controller class is the following one  p  precodepublic function createActionRequest request      em  thisgtgetDoctrinegtgetManager     contextSrv  thisgtgetexample.service.context     context  contextSrvgtgetContext      entity   new Formation     form  thisgtcreateFormnew FormationTypeem, context, entity     formgtbindrequest      if formgtisValid           emgtpersistentity         emgtflush          return thisgtredirectthisgtgenerateUrlformationshow, arrayid gt entitygtgetId           return array         entity gt entity,         form   gt formgtcreateView,       codepre  pSince one of my dynamic field cant be null, the first time the form is submitted, it cant be valid. So, the FormationType is loaded a second time. That means, if the field type was filled, my formModifier function can load the dynamic field formationList. Until there, everything works pretty well, and I got my new field.p  pBut, after a second submit on the form...nothing happen. The page is just reloaded, and no errors are displayed.p  pI checked the form content with p  precodevardumprequestgtrequestgtgetexamplecorebundleformationtype codepre  p Every fields including the dynamic one are filled with valid values.p  pI also try this  p  precodeforeachformgtall as item         echo itemgtgetName         vardumpitemgtgetErrors  codepre  p These lines dont show any error. But, the form is never valid.p  precodevardumpformgtisValid codepre  p It returns false. So the form is invalid.p  pFinally, if I remove the whole dynamic part, my form works. I dont understand whats wrong. There is no errors displayed by the form, and the csrf token seems right. Did I miss something  Thanks for your help.p

Negative 10593 pIm working on an enterprise ios application for the iphone that uses coredata as its persistence store.  We have a couple core data entities and one of them has 30 fields.  My data set exceeds 45,000 of these 30field entities.p  pI need to construct a query where my search string can match one of 12 different fields on the object.  My NSPredicate is basically a big rats nest of property  A  otherproperty  A ... etc where A is my search string.p  pWere just starting to tune this for performance because its pretty bad.  Are there any obvious things we should do  Would it be better to use compound predicates and just have each subpredicate be property  A p  pThoughts  Thanks in advance.p  pMy partial solution  I watched some wwdc videos on core data and basically did what Apple said.  Which was to create a relationship from my real object to another object to represent a searchtoken.  This new searchtoken entity had two fields  token and weight.  When I insert my main object into coredata I give him a set of these searchtokens.  One searchtoken per field I want to query over and the contents of the token property are some sort of normalized all lowercase data.  Then my predicate is simply ANY searchTokens.token beginswith .  So now were just searching one table over its indexed field and were not having to do any expersions in the right side of the where clause.  Coredata is really fast searching like this.  The only other thing I did was to put an NSTimer in shouldReloadTableForSearchString to only fire off the search after 1 second of inactivity.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9347369uisearchdisplaycontrollerwaitfornsecondsorforusertopresssearchbefUISearchDisplayController  wait for N seconds OR for user to press quotSearchquot before conducting searchap

Negative 10593 pI am new to oracle and oracle ebs and I need some help.p  pI am doing a report in oracle ebs r12 and I need to list flex values from fndflexvaluesvl view in a hierarchical way using a SQL query. It doesnt necessary has to be a hierarchial query. Any query will do. I just need a SQL statement that will return me flex values in their hierarchial way. p  pThere are two objects, that store information about flex values hierarchy. It is FNDFLEXVALUENORMHIERARCHY table and fndflexvaluechildrenv view. I assume one of these is enough, since fndflexvaluechildrenv is made using FNDFLEXVALUENORMHIERARCHY and some other objects.p  pHowever, the problem I faced is, that several parents may be listed for one flex value and that I need to find all top parents or leaves in order to do an upbottom or bottomup hierarchy. As far as I understand fndflexvaluechildrenv doesnt necessary store top parents stores only children. p  pAlso it seems that there is probably not one, but there may be multiple hierarchies if so, I need to list them all in one query.p  pYour help will be really appreciated. Ive been struggling with this one quite a while. Thank you very much for your attention. p  pBest regards, new user. p

Negative 10593 pSo thats the question...perhaps theres a regular expression for this Just to be clear, I dont want to remove ALL newlines and bunch all of the code together, only the extras.

Now Ive updated those source files on my PC, and their line endings are now messed up, with VS 2008 giving me a compiler error, telling me to fix my mac line endings. I found the a hrefhttpwww.grebulon.comsoftwarestripem.php relnofollowStripema VS addin, which fixes the compile error, but the code looks terrible, with tons of extra lines.p
Negative 10593 pWhen making automatically expanding arrays like Cs stdvector in C, it is often common or at least common advice to double the size of the array each time it is filled to limit the amount of calls to coderealloccode in order to avoid copying the entire array as much as possible.p  pEg. we start by allocating room for 8 elements, 8 elements are inserted, we then allocate room for 16 elements, 8 more elements are inserted, we allocate for 32.., etc.p  pBut coderealloccode does not have to actually copy the data if it can expand the existing memory allocation. For example, the following code only does 1 copy the initial NULL allocation, so it is not really a copy on my system, even though it calls coderealloccode 10000 timesp  precodeinclude ltstdlib.hgt include ltstdio.hgt  int main      int i     int copies  0     void data  NULL     void ndata      for i  0 i lt 10000 i              ndata  reallocdata, i  sizeofint         if data  ndata             copies         data  ndata          printfdn, copies   codepre  pI realize that this example is very clinical  a real world application would probably have more memory fragmentation and would do more copies, but even if I make a bunch of random allocations before the coderealloccode loop, it only does marginally worse with 24 copies instead.p  pSo, is the doubling method really necessary Would it not be better to just call coderealloccode each time a element is added to the dynamic arrayp

Negative 10593 pI have the following situation at work and wanted to hear some advice as im pretty much out of ideas and going out of my mind.p  pI have a solution that contains our serverside projects  Some Web Applications to be deployed to IIS and a couple of class libraries with logic. It was originally made as far as i know in VS2010 under .NET 3.5. The solution was upgraded over time and now contains some projects that are targeting .NET 4.0 as well.p  pThe solution builds and works as expected in runtime with VS2010 and VS2013 which Im mostly using now on my machine  a 32bit Windows 7 SP1 machine with a full VS2013 install, etc. The solution also builds perfectly through usage of command line MSBuild on my machine so 32 bit.p  pWhen built from our 64bit TFS 2010 server, The build fails citing indirect references from a .NET 3.5 assembly to .NET 4.0 base assemblies like mscorlib, etc.p  pThe clientside solution with a WPF shell and more class library logic projects, as well as the shared projects among both, are all .NET 3.5 and all build well on both my machine and the TFS server.p  pWhat Ive noticed so far after reading a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combvisualstudioarchive20101221incorrectsolutionbuildorderingwhenusingmsbuildexe.aspx relnofollowTHISa is that the build order on the TFS server is different. I tried the workarounds for the mainfirst issue mentioned, but none helped so far. Havent tried the second compiling forcibly on 32bit or to the affect as mentioned, But im going to. p  pEither way, Here are the server solution build orders simplified and named to what i thought would explain whats going on.p  pVS2010VS2013 p  ol liCommon.csproj  .NET 3.5 Sharedcommon code between client and server solutions.li liServer.Common.csproj  .NET 4.0 Serverside projects only sharedcommon code. References Common.li liClient.Common.csproj  .NET 3.5 Clientside projects only sharedcommon code. References Common.li liServer.DomainModels.csproj  .NET 4.0 Server side class library. References Server.Common and Common.li liAgents.csproj  .NET 3.5 Client side class library, used to call the serverside Web Application projects, A proxy of sorts. References Client.Common and Common.li ol  pThis order builds correctly.p  pHowever, When running on the aforementioned TFS2010 Server build i get this order insteadp  ol liServer.DomainModels.csproj which was 4 above  1. Common.csproj invoked to satisfy the reference by the above.  2. Server.Common.csproj also invoked to satisfy the reference above.li liProperOriginal ordered Common.csproj already built above, 1 beforeli liProperOriginal ordered Server.Common.csproj already built above, 2 beforeli liAgents.csproj 5 before  1. Client.Common.csproj 3 before and was built before 5 in the original orderli ol  pThe Client.Common.csproj project .NET 3.5 fails to build because it cant satisfy its reference for Common.csproj who is presumably Targeting .NET 3.5 because apparently it now has indirect references to .NET 4.0 assemblies  as it was built to satisfy the reference for the Server.DomainModels.csproj project strong.NET 4.0strong.p  pThis doesnt make sense to me, But it seems to be what happens.  Id appreciate any advice or suggestions to checkchange regarding this issue.p  pThank you in advance.p

Negative 10593 pI have a class, EventPresentationController, that displays data in an Event object. The class needs to be passed an Event object, but sometimes that object needs to be downloaded from a remote service first. I dont want the controller to have any knowledge of networking stuff, so I thought that instead of passing in an Event object, Id pass it a RAC signal. Then if the object exists I can send the signal immediately, but if the object needs to be downloaded, I can download it then send the signal. However, Id like for the controller to display an activity indicator if in fact a download needs to occur. p  pI see that RACCommand has an executing signal I can subscribe to, so I suppose I can pass that instead of an event, but semantically it seems weird to be initializing a view controller with a command vs. an event, or a signal that will deliver an event. Is using RACCommand the right thing to dop

Negative 10593 pI am stuck up in a situation where the database schema present in my SSDT  Database project has some less schema while the production database will have some more schema object. These additional schema object are create by customer only for his own purpose for e.g maintenance.  p  pin nutshell the SSDT  Database project contains all the schema related to application where as the product  customer environment contains application related schema as well as some more maintenance related schema object p  pNow i need to modify some of the application related schema object in the SSDT  database project but my worry is when i provide the build to the customer then the default nature of SSDT  database project is the compare the 2 database i.e source customer database and Target SSDT  database project and drop the object from source which are not present in target. therefore the object created by customer for maintenance purpose would get delete.p  pso is there any why where i can avoid such a case through SSDT  Database project setting.p  pThanks in advance p
Negative 10593 pConsider the following simplified domain model i am currently working onp  precodecase class Productval id  Long, val name  String, product  Option[Product], category  Option[ProductCategory]  case class Priceval id  Long, val amount  Double, val conditions  Seq[Condition]  trait Condition    def isTrueproduct ProductBoolean  case class ManufacturerNameConditionval id  Long, val name  String... case class DateConditionval id  Long, val validFrom  Date, val validTo  Date... codepre  pstrongWhat does this model representstrongp  pIt represents a simple price service, which allows to define multiple prices for a product or product category. The final price for a product is determined by checking all its matching prices and their associated conditions. E.g. there may be a normal price for a Product and one extra price, which is only active today, because it has a DateCondition.p  pstrongWhat is my problemstrong A Price may be associated with multiple Conditions. Each condition may be of another type. So i am asking myself how this should be solved with Slick polymorphic relationships. Basically i want to have a DAOlike interface which fetches the prices along with the associated conditions.p  pstrongMy Questionsstrongp  ol liIs it possible to implement this model with Slick probably yesli liPolymorphic Relationships Is it a good idea to solve this problem in Slick Slick states that it wants to overcome the object relational mismatch and here i have the feeling as if i was trying to fight the framework with this model. Does Slick not play well with such an objectoriented approach Should i choose another approachli ol  pstrongPlz notestrong Yes, i have no code to show of what i have tried, but right now i need some direction to look for. Currently i am somehow lost p

I oversimplified to the point of hindering.  Anyways I added more code that may help explain what I have going on.  p  pI changed the original codeWorkercode class to be codeManagercode and have a child list of codeWorkerscode.  The list of workers is created from the codeManagercode class and I construct them using the codeIServicecode which I would like to pass a Concrete OR Mock implementation.  I then will kick off the Workers to do something involving codeIServicecode and a variable that I provide it.

Negative 10593 pIm trying to syncrhonize two folders on two different nas. Sadly there is no chance, that the nas can replicate to the other or synchronize with the other nas. By now i synchronize the folder via sftp over a ftpclient which loads the file from one server and uplaods it to the other. Because one of the nas is in the local network, the speed is ok for downloading of the first nas.p  pFor this solution there is one lack. My Laptop or pc needs to be constantly on. Working on this i cam up with the idea to move this process to an raspberry pi.p  pCurrently i can mount both nas with sshfs and it works good. Also i can copy from the first to the second nas. Now im working on the sync. Therefore im willing to use unison. rsync seems to be designed to replicate all data and not to synchronize both ways.p  pThe problem i run into is, that using unison is quite slow. this si the config file i usep  precodeltfolders etc...gt batch  true auto  true perms  0 fastchecktrue ignoreinodenumberstrue codepre  pIt seems that the first check for changes needs a bit of time, but after the upload to the remote nas unisons seems to download the file again to check it.p  pIs there a possibility to fasten the synchronization between two remote folders Maybe with a additional parameter that i dont have found Thanks in advancep

Negative 10593 pDo region and language selections in the Windows OS actually have a set of characters associated to themp  pWhen you use the CultureAndRegionalInfoBuilder class to register a new culture to the system, the only characters associated to your new culture that you can set are the native digits. I need to register an obscure language that uses UTF8 characters that dont exist in the languages that come packaged with Windows or in any of the language packs. Im uncertain about the internals of Windows culture definitions and whether or not a character set is stored with them. My assumption is that the culture definition does nothing more than let you specify the native digits and various formats used in that culture and give applications a mechanism for localization and formatting and that it really has nothing to do with a specified character set. Can someone tell me if my assumption here is correct.p

Negative 10593 pFor a game in codelibgdxcode with codebox2dcode i would like to be able to let the codePlayercodebr crouch. Crouching should change its codeFixturecode to be a 11m hitbox instead of a 0.52m hitbox.br One possibility would be to store 2 codeBodycodes, one for normal and one for crouching. Then if the codePlayercode wants to crouch i could remove the first codeBodycode from the codeWorldcode and add the second codeBodycode, but this way seems to complex for such an easy task.

Negative 10593 pAt this point in the development of our web application we are slowly finding the needs of the application to differ from what the membership provider offers by default. As we implement new features we are overloading the default methods and changing a lot of things to the point that its getting confusing and the point of inheriting the MembershipProvider does not seem necessarry any longer.p  pMy question is besides the use of the custom controls like Login, CreateUserWizard which we are already not using, RecoverPassword, etc. what is the benefit of using the MembershipProvider I have already looked into such things as encrypting password and I feel that the Crypto helper class will provide that to us. What other things should I be aware ofp
Negative 10593 pIm working on a game with a few people. This game requires us to create subclasses of JComponent, which each have their own paintComponent method, invoked when it is added to a container. These subclasses are called Block, Goal, Spike, Ball, and Pit. Adding a single one of these components to a frame is no problem, since nothing else is being added along with it. I already added more than one JButton in the same JPanel in the main menu, and JButton also extends JComponent, so we all assumed our subclasses would work as well. However, when we try to add more than one of these even of the same type, only one of them, if any, show up in the frame. We also track mouse clicks and mouse motion which are used for drawing lines with the window for Balls to bounce off of, and adding a Line and another component does not work either. This so far is the only way we thought would fix our problem, but did notp  precodeContainer c  this.getContentPane c.setLayoutnull Block b  new Block200, 200 Block b1  new Block220, 200 b.setBounds200, 200, 20, 20 b1.setBounds220, 200, 20, 20 c.addb c.addb1 c.revalidate codepre  pThis method attempts to add two Blocks in the same container. Since I set the layout of the Container to codenullcode, I can specify the exact location and size of the Block. When initializing a Block, the constructor takes in the x and y coordinate of the top left of the block, and the default size is 20x20 pixels. I also call codesetBoundscode on both Blocks, so that they would be right next to each other, theoretically. However, when I compile and execute the code, Only the first one shows up. Any reason as to why, and how can this be fixed Also, how would you add a Line and, a Block, for example I have it so that creating two lines works, which creates an codeArrayListcode of Lines, and after a new one is drawn, it is added to the codeArrayListcode, after the previously added lines in the codeArrayListcode are painted in the container. When I tried to add a Block and draw a Line, I could not start drawing a Line, which I presume is because even though the Block only takes up 20x20 space, it takes up the entire container, so that nothing else can be added.p

Negative 10593 pIm having a weird problem in PhoneGap 3.5 in iOS 7.1 both simulator and device. A very similar perhaps identical problem happens in FireFox in MacOSX. p  pWhen I click on a jQuerydefined button that invokes a JavaScript function it fails because the function is not defined. If I load Safaris debugger and view the page  the  line for the included function is missing from . p  pBut if I hit the reload icon in the Safari debugger then all JavaScript files are loaded and the functions are defined. So  this tells me the files are all there.p  pThe same happens in FireFox  the first time the page is loaded no console messages appear after reload they work fine. p  pIt smells like a race condition or load order issue of some sort. But if it is load order why wouldnt JavaScript throw an errorp  precode ltheadgt     ltmeta charsetutf8gt     ltmeta nameviewport contentwidthdevicewidth, initialscale1gt     lttitlegtABR Practice Examination2lttitlegt     ltscript typetextjavascript src..jsjqueryjquery1.11.0.min.jsgtltscriptgt     ltscript typetextjavascript src..jsjqueryjquery.mobile1.4.2.min.jsgtltscriptgt     ltscript typetextjavascriptgt         console.logBefore jquery.mobile1.4.2.min.css load     ltscriptgt     ltlink relstylesheet href..jsjqueryjquery.mobile1.4.2.min.cssgt     ltscript typetextjavascriptgt         console.logBefore qmdemos.css load     ltscriptgt     ltlink relstylesheet href..cssjqmdemos.cssgt     ltlink relshortcut icon href..favicon.icogt     ltlink relstylesheet hrefhttpfonts.googleapis.comcssfamilyOpenSans300,400,700gt     ltscript typetextjavascriptgt         console.logBefore cordova.js load     ltscriptgt     ltscript typetextjavascript src..cordova.jsgtltscriptgt     ltscript typetextjavascriptgt         console.logBefore index.js load     ltscriptgt     ltscript typetextjavascript src..jsindex.jsgtltscriptgt     ltscript typetextjavascriptgt         console.logBefore DicomStudy.js load     ltscriptgt     ltscript typetextjavascript src..pluginsDicomStudy.jsgtltscriptgt     ltscript typetextjavascriptgt         console.logBefore ABRUtils.js load     ltscriptgt     ltscript typetextjavascript src..jsABRUtils.jsgtltscriptgt  ltheadgt codepre  pSo  the first time the page is loaded  none of the console messages are displayed in the console.

Negative 10593 pIn my program, I will be storing each block of data in a separate file. Multiple threads will both read from and write to various files, and I want to avoid possible problems from not synchronizing this properly. Essentially, I want a setup where each file behaves as if it has its own codeReadWriteLockcode Two threads can write to two different files concurrently, but not to the same file. I could do just this And do some optimizations where codeReadWriteLockcodes are only instantiated when they are needed and destroyed when not, but Im not sure that this is the proper thing to do. Is there a better way to do thisp  pIve read that using a codeFileLockcode would emnotem be the right thing to do in this situation, because it only matters between different processes, and would not do anything in this case because all of my threads are in the same process.p  pTo summarize What I want to avoid is having one thread reading from one file locking out every other thread from doing anything with the many other files.p

Negative 10593 pI have been researching dynamic content for MVC views and partial views but have not successfully found an architecture to fit my needs.p  pBasically I am required to create a landing page based on parameters pass by the URL. For basics a hrefhttpmydns.commyconrollermyviewlandingpageParam1 relnofollowhttpmydns.commyconrollermyviewlandingpageParam1ap  pThe controller will need to find the HTML that will be used to create the view. The view is going to be different based on the landing page. for the sake of the question, I am using landingpage as an example My goal is to be able to deploy a Landing page and based on the URL use that HTML Landing page in the view based on the landingpage parameter that is passed.p  pThere are other views that are working currently in the controller.  I am trying to add functionality to be able to add a new one time page without having to recompile.p  pI have searched through various ideas on how to load dynamic views but cannot seem to find a solution that fits this need based on what I have read.p  pI can possibly RedirectToAction but I am still in the dark on where to deploy and I am getting several problems with Razor as it is not in the shared directory and then I am stuck with deployment issues as I want to organize the landing pages differently than I am organizing the views.p  pstrongSolutionstrong I decided to take a different approach and use the ContentResult Action in the controller.

The View can then house all of the paths to load jQuery, CSS and other necessary javascript to integrate with the raw HTML and allow me to deploy the HTML files into any directory structure that I want.  The configuration XML file allows me to find XML elements and use those values for any HTML that I am looking for, like a welcome and thank you page.  The helper object will open the XML and find the configuration based on the parameters passed to the View.  p  precodeltContentLandingItem entrycode1 customerIDCutomer1gt   ltContentLandingPageSRCgtCustomersCustomer1Customer1Landing.htmltContentLandingPageSRCgt   ltContentThankyouSRCgtContentDefaultGenericThankyou.htmltContentThankyouSRCgt ltContentLandingItemgt ltContentLandingItem entrycode2 customerIDCutomer2gt   ltContentLandingPageSRCgtCustomersCustomer2Customer2Landing.htmltContentLandingPageSRCgt   ltContentThankyouSRCgtCustomersCustomer2Customer2Thankyou.htmltContentThankyouSRCgt ltContentLandingItemgt codepre  pThe view still performs its duties and works independently on it own letting the raw HTML decorate the View.  The model is still intact and can be used as I wish.  The FormCollection is there in case a form submit posts the values to the view and provides some things that I omitted from this question as it did not pertain to this subject.p  pI dont want to answer my own question and I found the pieces that helped me on another site, so I am putting what I did here in case anyone needs this functionality.p

Negative 10593 pI have some simple traits Entity in the example below that are extended by case classes in my app. I would like to create an EntityMapper trait that provides an interface for handling the case classes that extend the Entity trait Foo in the example below. I thought I should be able to do this fairly easily using generics and bounding but Ive spent a couple of hours on it already and I havent gotten it to work correctly. The code below is what I think I should be able to do but it fails with a compiler error.

If I comment out the line in question printlne.id, it compiles but that is not useful because I cannot access or modify any of the properties of Foo. p  pI have tried using a covariant argument to the mapper trait and then supplying the type to the FooMapper object definition but that yields the same error. The code for that attempt is belowp  precodetrait EntityMapper[Entity]      def create[E lt Entity]e E E   object FooMapper extends EntityMapper[Foo]  ...  codepre  pI have also tried achieving the same thing with simple inheritance but I cannot correctly restrict the type parameter in FooMapper to only take Foos, I have to make the method signature match the trait exactly which is why I started trying to implement it using generics with a type bound. The code for that attempt is belowp  precodetrait EntityMapper      def createe Entity Entity   object FooMapper extends EntityMapper      def createe Foo Foo           printlne.id         e       codepre  pThe error code returned isp  pTest.scala13 error object creation impossible, since method create in trait EntityMapper of type e experiment.Entityexperiment.Entity is not definedp  pNote that experiment.Entity does not match experiment.Foo class Foo in package experiment is a subclass of trait Entity in package experiment, but method parameter types must match exactly.p  precodeobject FooMapper extends EntityMapper          codepre  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.

Negative 10593 pI have created a method that is supposed to create a copy of an array of length up to the number of values stored in the original array.

It prints it out when I call this method in my main method. But when I comment out the print statement and use return temp it returns the memory location. How would I print the values in the copied array WITHOUT using the JCF or any built in methods I must use a return statement and the name of the method must remain exactly the same for the specifications our teacher provided. Any help would be appreciated.p

Negative 10593 pSo Ive been tracking a bug for a day or two now which happens out on a remote server that I have little control over.  The ins and outs of my code are, I provide a jar file to our UI team, which wraps postgres and provides storage for data that users import.  The import process is very slow due to multiple reasons, one of which is that the users are importing unpredictable, large amounts of data which we cant really cut down on.  This has lead to a whole plethora of time out issues.p  pAfter some preliminary investigation, Ive narrowed it down to the jdbc to the postgres database is timing out.  I had a lot of trouble replicating this on my local test setup, but have finally managed to by reducing the socketTimeout of the connection properties to 10s theres more than 10s between each call made on the connection.p  pMy question now is, what is the best way to keep this alive  Ive set the tcpKeepAlive to true, but this doesnt seem to have an effect, do I need to poll the connection manually or something  From what Ive read, Im assuming that polling is automatic, and is controlled by the OS.  If this is true, I dont really have control of the OS settings in the run environment, what would be the best way to handle this p  pI was considering testing the connection each time it is used, and if it has timed out, I will just create a new one.  Would this be the correct course of action or is there a better way to keep the connection alive  Ive just taken a look at this post where people are suggesting that you should open and close a connection per query a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8345133whenmyapplosesconnectionhowshoulditrytorecoverWhen my app loses connection, how should I try to recoverap  pIn my situation, I have a series of sequential inserts which take place on a single thread, if a single one fails, they all fail.

Negative 10593 pGood life for you guysp  pHere is what Im trying to do. I have a gridview filled by icons. I have a target drop view to which I want to drag icons to from gridview.

Negative 10593 pIt just seems like not of one mind in the design here, because integer data and character data of 16 bits is now differentiable but integer and character data of 8 bits is not.p  pC has always had the only choice for 8bit values a char. But the feature of recognizing wchart as an official, distinct type from unsigned short enables improvements, but only for widestring users. It seems like this is not coordinated  the language acts differently for 8bit and 16bit values.p  pI think there is clear value in having more distinct types having distinct 8bit char AND and 8bit byte would be much nicer, e.g. in usage for operator overloading. For examplep  precode This kind of sucks... BYTE m  59      This is really unsigned char because there is no other option cout ltlt m        outputs character data  because it assumes 8bits is char data.                   This is a consequence of limited ability to overload   But for wide strings, the behavior is different and better... unsigned short s  59 wcout ltlt s       Prints the number 59 like we expect wchart w  LC wcout ltlt w       Prints out C like we expect codepre  pThe language would be more consistent if there were a new 8bit integer type introduced, which would enable more intelligent overloads and overloads that behave more similarly irrespective of if you are using narrow or wide strings.p

Negative 10593 pI have a project that can read and write floats tofrom a text file. All was fine in XCode on Mac, but when I luckily tested it on Visual Studio I got some really weird results. It seemed that my floats were being written ok, but when I read them they were rounded off downwards, i.e. truncated.p  pAfter some major headache and hours of debugging, I finally realized that doing codesetlocaleLCALL, swedishcode affects codestofcode but not codetostringcode, which means that writing floats to file would use the dot . as a decimal point, but reading them would use a comma ,, and therefor anything after the dot was dismissed. p  pThis problem does not occur on XCode, only on Visual Studio. The solution was to change from codeLCALLcode to codeLCCTYPEcode because I still need to print some swedish characters.p  pIs this the way it should work How does one know which functions are affected by setlocale and which are not How would I write floats to a file using the localespecific decimal point, since codetostringcode always seems to use the dot . And why is none of this happening in XCode, only in Visual Studiop

Negative 10593 pSo first I have gone over a very large amount of other sources trying to look for a solution or an explanation of my error, but I havent found anything that helps me quite yet.p  pI have been learning all this stuff on my own so I am definitely lacking in some of the foundation knowledge and it has caught up to me. Basically the form I am having trouble with allows the user to generate three different reports based on the kind of criteria they care about. There are three different combo boxes cboCompany, cboProject, cboEmployee. I use the Nz command to change null values to zero and then use If Statements to  determine which report to use depending on what the user selects. I hope that kind of makes since. Its easier to show than explain. That part all works fine though.p  pThe problem Im getting is when I want to do a print preview for the report the user generates. I need the where clause to take the values the user selects to use in the print preview. I cant get the syntax right for the where clause to actually do this.p  pHere is how I call my variables. The Nz function as I understand require the variables to be variants, because of this Im not quite sure how to write the syntax for the where clause. I know integers, strings, and dates all have different syntax but I dont know what variant would be. p  precodeDim Company As Variant Dim Project As Variant Dim Employee As Variant Dim EndDate As String Dim StartDate As String  Company  NzcboCompany, 0 Project  NzcboProject, 0 Employee  NzcboEmployee, 0 StartDate  txtStartDate.Value EndDate  txtEndDate.Value codepre  pSo this next part is how I have written one of the report options with my best guess of the syntax for the where clause. It doesnt work so If you could help point me in the right direction I would greatly appreciate it.p  precode ElseIf Company ltgt 0 And Project ltgt 0 And Employee ltgt 0 Then     DoCmd.OpenReport ProjectReportEmployeeR, acViewPreview, , [cboCompany]  amp Company amp  And [cboEmployee]  amp Employee amp  And [cboProject]  amp Project amp  And [txtStartDate]  amp StartDate amp  And [txtEndDate]  amp EndDate amp , acWindowNormal codepre  pIf I dont explain things well enough or you need more code to help please let me know, and thank you in advance.p  pEdit Just to give a more complete picture this is the code behind the entire form. p  pPrivate Sub cboCompanyAfterUpdate     Me.cboProject.Requery End Subp  pPrivate Sub cmdSubmitClickp  precodeOpen Report With Filter Criteria Dim Company As Variant Dim Project As Variant Dim Employee As Variant  Company  NzcboCompany, 0 Project  NzcboProject, 0 Employee  NzcboEmployee, 0  If Company  0 Then     MsgBox Please Select At Least A Company To Generate A Report     cboCompany.Value  Null     cboProject.Value  Null     cboEmployee.Value  Null  ElseIf Company ltgt 0 And Project  0 And Employee  0 Then     DoCmd.BrowseTo acBrowseToReport, ProjectReportCompanyR, MainF.NavigationSubformgtProjectReportF.Child31  ElseIf Company ltgt 0 And Project ltgt 0 And Employee  0 Then     DoCmd.BrowseTo acBrowseToReport, ProjectReportProjectR, MainF.NavigationSubformgtProjectReportF.Child31  ElseIf Company ltgt 0 And Project ltgt 0 And Employee ltgt 0 Then     DoCmd.BrowseTo acBrowseToReport, ProjectReportEmployeeR, MainF.NavigationSubformgtProjectReportF.Child31  ElseIf Company ltgt 0 And Project  0 And Employee ltgt 0 Then     MsgBox Please Select A Project  End If codepre  pEnd Subp  pPrivate Sub FormCurrent  Me.cboCompany.SetFocus End Subp  pPrivate Sub FormLoadp  pSet Date Values    Dim EndDate As String    Dim StartDate As String         StartDate  FormatDateSerialYearDate, MonthDateAddm, 1, Date, 16, Short Date         EndDate  FormatDateSerialYearDate, MonthDate, 15, Short Datep  precodetxtStartDate.Value  StartDate txtEndDate.Value  EndDate codepre  pSet The Form Message on Open Child31     DoCmd.BrowseTo acBrowseToForm, ProjectReportMessageF, MainF.NavigationSubformProjectReportF.Child31p  pEnd Sub   PrintClick   Private Sub Command39Click On Error GoTo Command39ClickErrp  precodeDim Company As Variant Dim Project As Variant Dim Employee As Variant Dim EndDate As String Dim StartDate As String  Company  NzcboCompany, 0 Project  NzcboProject, 0 Employee  NzcboEmployee, 0 StartDate  txtStartDate.Value EndDate  txtEndDate.Value   If Company ltgt 0 And Project  0 And Employee  0 Then      DoCmd.OpenReport ProjectReportCompanyR, acViewPreview, , , acNormal  ElseIf Company ltgt 0 And Project ltgt 0 And Employee  0 Then      DoCmd.OpenReport ProjectReportProjectR, acViewPreview, , , acNormal  ElseIf Company ltgt 0 And Project ltgt 0 And Employee ltgt 0 Then      DoCmd.OpenReport ProjectReportEmployeeR, acViewPreview, , [cboCompany]  amp Company amp  And [cboEmployee]  amp Employee amp  And [cboProject]  amp Project amp  And [txtStartDate]  amp StartDate amp  And [txtEndDate]  amp EndDate amp , acWindowNormal  End If codepre  pCommand39ClickExit     Exit Subp  pCommand39ClickErr     MsgBox Error     Resume Command39ClickExitp  pEnd Subp

Negative 10593 pOver the last couple days I have been programming an android app With Android Studio, collecting JSON data to use through an externally provided API. However, I have found that, occasionally, my program refused to collect this information due to refusing to connect to the API service. This because I have found that likely due to authentication accessing the API can sometimes take time of up to 5 seconds to retrieve all data. While the app does seem to keep running trying to fetch the data, my logs state that connection is broken down after trying to connect for a few seconds.p  pAs I have no control over the external provider and my app requires their service, I am forced to find a way to increase the timeout before the connection shuts down. I fail to find what may be used to do this or what could be used to circumvent this problem.p  pAny help would be appreciated.p

Is ruby windows printing not a thingp  pIs there an easy attempt to do this or do I need to use some other language, perhaps make a python receipt printing backend or so Do I really need to do this from scratch, using trial and error and a printer documentationp  pThanksp
Negative 10593 pIm thinking of two solutions to create a resource manager for my SFMLGame. Both require templating Im new to templating, but I prefer one of those solutions, even if I dont really know how to make it work.p  pId like to do something like thisp  precodestdmapltstring, classgt resources  templateltclass Tgt T getResourcestdstring name     return T resources.findname  codepre  pIn other words, Id like to have all my resources stored in one class, and that there is only one function to get a resource, and this function should always return the type of the resource  So that, in order to load a resource, I can just dop  precodeTexture texture  resourceManager.getResourcemytexture.png codepre  pBut I cant figure out how to get this working.p  pMy second approach would be to template a class, and then instantiate multiple resource managers, one for each type of resource.p  precodetemplateltclass Resgt class ResourceManager      stdmapltstring, Resgt resources     ...     Res getstdstring name         return resources.findname Just to visualize. Of course there would be null checks etc in the real method       codepre  pIn my opinion, the second solution looks way cleaner codewise, but the first one would be easier to use And I could just make the methods static so I wont have to worry about decoupling.p  pI really dont know where I should put the instances of the managers from the second approach. Probably I would make the instances static and put them in my main class, but that just doesnt seem right.p

Negative 10593 pMySQL innodb table, partitioned on a datetime column, basically just a logging table.p  pWhen I attempt to reorganize or drop a partition, Which needs an exclusive metadata lock I want the query to timeout after a few seconds and throw an error, which I can then catch, and retry lateralert whoever is in charge of the serveretc. Is there a goodeasy way to do this, or do I need to spin up another thread to watch the partitioning thread, killing the query if it takes too longp  pBackground We had a problem where all queries to a table would hang on Waiting for table metadata lock. This was tracked down to a transaction that was never closed, preventing the hourly partitioning code from locking the table, while prevent anything else from getting access. The code at fault was modified, but I would like the partitioning system to stay up under those circumstances.p

Negative 10593 pBasically, I need a memory pool for fast allocation of small objects. Ideally, Id like to replace allocations on both the host, and for memory allocated on GPUs with cudaMalloc. I can write my own, and I will if I have to, but I wouldnt mind swapping in one of the solid opensource implementations.p  pThe only issue is that, with cudaMalloc, the memory pool cannot touch the allocated memory. My understanding is that many all of the common memory allocators, like those in the title, store a small amount of metadata in the allocated data. They therefore wouldnt work.p  pDoes anyone know of a memory allocator for which this is not the casep

Negative 10593 pHi postgresql experts,   I have already searched my problem, some of them seem relevant but actually not the same. I apologize first if there is a dup.   I am doing a text search with postgresql. Since I cant change the already defined sql files limitations from the project, all the updates or changes need to be done in a new file to alter the previous definition. In order to make it clear, I will list all the code I have which are related to the table which am doing full text search. I will list the codes in their execute order.p  pMy problem is, whenever I insert a row to mytable, the searchvector is not updated automatically.

Negative 10593 pIts kind of long story, sorry. So as ive been teaching myself python Ive been wondering how I could apply what im learning to my everyday life or work so im not just doing random exercises and tutorials. I figured i could write a script that could automate a portion of what i do at work.p  pIm a Food and Beverage manager for a hotel, so one thing i do is keep an inventory of all the liquor, beer, and wine we have. I figured i could come up with something that couldp  ul lipCheck my current inventory from an excel spread sheetpli lipCompare it to what my par levels should be quantities of liquor, beer, and      wine that I should always have available at the hotelpli lipIf my current inventory is less than what my par should be, the script will calculate the difference as well as the name of the liquor and export it to an email that would get sent out automatically.pli lipIt would do this twice a week Monday and Thursday at 9 am.pli ul  pIm not looking for solutions or an answer to this this is something i want to figure out on my own, but ive always had trouble imagining how to begin to structure a script like this. I am not a beginner but im nowhere near intermediate either. Should I use a bunch of functions, or maybe classes with some methods What would the skeleton, i guess i could call it, of the script be composed ofp  pAlso, if someone could point me in the right direction to read up and learn how to accomplish some of the things I want to do, likep  pexporting data to an email and sending it out.p  phow to read individual cells in excel, and just working with python and excel in general.p  phow to basically set the script up on a timer.p  pMy computer is always on at work so i have no issue with this script constantly running in the background.p  pI just started working on this today, i havent had much time because of work.

Negative 10593 pI am trying to write some Deterministic Finite Automaton related algorithms. So the obvious start is to define the entities codeDFAcode, codeStatecode and codeEdgescode. However, I though since the codeDFAcode is a kind of graph I should have basic classes codeGraphcode, codeNodecode and codeEdgecode each implementing codeIGraphcode, codeINodecode and codeIEdgecode. And then have codeDFAcode and codeStatecode extend codeGraphcode and codeNodecode.p  pSo the stripped down code of codeGraphcode isp  precodeclass Graph      ...     public void addNodeINode node              ...          ...   codepre  pNow the main difference between codeStatecode and codeNodecode is that codeStatecode adds properties codeisFinalStatecode and codeisStartingStatecode to codeNodecode. So I want codeStatecode objects to be added to the codeDFAcode not the codeNodecode objects through codeGraphcodes codeaddNodecode method. p  pI thought I can override and make this method codeprivatecode in codeDFAcode and have defined a new method codeaddStatecode which will accept codeStatecode objects. But reducing the visibility of parent class members in derived class is not allowed in Java. p  pSo what is the standard solution  approach followed in such scenarios. Or am I thinking this all wrongp

Negative 10593 pI am having some problems with coderake dbrollbackcode. Heres the setupp  pOne week ago I pulled some changes from the repository, which included a new migration. I ran coderake dbmigratecode and all was well with the world. Fastforward 7 days and multiple commits and pushes, and I started working on a new feature. I created a new feature branch and then created a new migration. I ran that migration, wrote some codes, then realized I had made a small error in the migration that I had just created. I thought I could just run coderake dbrollbackcode, make a few changes to that one migration, and then coderake dbmigratecode again.p  pBut heres the rub. When I ran coderake dbrollbackcode it rolled back strongtwostrong migrations instead of just one. Running coderake dbmigratecode then migrates both of those migrations. I can go back and forth all day long, but every time it always rolls back 2 migrations.p  pI did some searching around here on stackoverflow and found a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions19805637whydoesrakedbrollbackrollbackthreestepsthis questiona that is specifically referencing the STEP parameter that can be added to codemigratecode and coderollbackcode, but going through everything in that question has not helped me. At first nothing was returned when I ran codeecho STEPcode, so I specifically set it with codeexport STEP1code, but that didnt help coderake dbrollbackcode still rolls back 2 steps every time. And, even when I run coderake dbrollback STEP1code it still rolls back 2 steps.p  pAlso, I checked the version number in the schema, and just after running coderake dbmigratecode the version is consistent with the newest migration that I just created. After running coderake dbrollbackcode and it going back 2 steps, the version number is consistent with the 2nd most recent migration.p  pI want to solve this problem for 2 reasonsp  ol liI need to rollback only strongonestrong migration so I can commit my changes and then switch back to the development branch and not pollute the developement schema.li liI want to fully understand how coderake dbrollbackcode works. Maybe there is a way to hack this out and get things going, but I want to understand this at a deeper level.li ol  pIs there some sort of app config that determines this Have some wires gotten crossed and I need to manually reset something Thanks for your helpp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pAs per some comments and responsesp  pI explicitly set codeexport STEP1code in my .bashprofile and that hasnt made a difference and it still rolls back 2 steps.p  pI was aware of migrating to a specific version, and yes, that is a way to get to specific place for me. I can rollback the 2 steps that it is forcing me and then migrate forward 1 step by specifying the version. It works, but its not how this strongshouldstrong work and I really want to get to the bottom of all this.p  pThe output of coderake dbmigratestatuscode always returns this errorp  precoderake aborted ArgumentError invalid value for Integer  Userseliduke.rvmgemsruby2.1.0gemsactiverecord4.0.5libactiverecordrailtiesdatabases.rake98in  Userseliduke.rvmgemsruby2.1.0gemsactiverecord4.0.5libactiverecordrailtiesdatabases.rake98in block 4 levels in lttop requiredgt Userseliduke.rvmgemsruby2.1.0gemsactiverecord4.0.5libactiverecordrailtiesdatabases.rake98in map Userseliduke.rvmgemsruby2.1.0gemsactiverecord4.0.5libactiverecordrailtiesdatabases.rake98in block 3 levels in lttop requiredgt Userseliduke.rvmgemsruby2.1.0binrubyexecutablehooks15in eval Userseliduke.rvmgemsruby2.1.0binrubyexecutablehooks15in ltmaingt Tasks TOP gt dbmigratestatus codepre  pAnd the output of coderake dbversioncode might be acting strange. If I have just recently migrated all the way forward, it is code20150309194758code, which corresponds to my most recent migration. If I have just rolled back the 2 steps it is forcing me, the version is code20150203171351code, which corresponds to the migration that is strong3strong steps back. Is that normal Shouldnt it be code20150303192838code, which is 2 steps backp  pAlso, I now see a peculiarity in the output for coderake dbrollbackcode. It first shows the rolling back of the first migration like normal 1 step and then it looks like maybe the Apartment gem is chiming in and rolling back the next migration 2 step.p  precode 20150309194758 CreateFeeds reverting   droptablefeeds, idgtfalse    gt 0.0291s  20150309194758 CreateFeeds reverted 0.0293s   Rolling back development tenant  20150303192838 AddDisplayRankToEventPrizes reverting   removecolumneventprizes, displayrank, integer, indexgttrue, aftergtwinneruserid    gt 0.5963s  20150303192838 AddDisplayRankToEventPrizes reverted 0.5964s  codepre  pSee that codeRolling back development tenantcode line Could the apartment gem be causing the 2nd step rollbackp

Negative 10593 pIn my Unity project, I want to have a progress bar that starts loading when I import a .obj model during runtime.p  pHow I want to it work is when I press spacebar, the ObjImporter would start importingdrawing the assigned model and during that period of time while its drawing, there would be a progress bar somewhere that shows the completion of the importingdrawing progress, so the user could see the estimated amount of time neededto complete and not get impatient.p  pIm using a slightly modified ObjImporter.cs from unity wikip  precode This version of ObjImporter first reads through the entire file, getting a count of how large   the final arrays will be, and then uses standard arrays for everything as opposed to ArrayLists   or any other fancy things.     using UnityEngine using System.Collections using System.Collections.Generic using System.IO using System.Text  public class ObjImporter  MonoBehaviour       public GameObject spawnPoint     public GameObject emptyPrefabWithMeshRenderer     public string meshPath     public GameObject spawnedPrefab     public float progressPercentage      int noOfLines      void Start               progressPercentage  0           void Update               ifInput.GetKeyDownspace             Mesh importedMesh  GetComponentltObjImportergt.ImportFilemeshPath             noOfLines  TotalLinesmeshPath             spawnedPrefabInstantiateemptyPrefabWithMeshRenderer,spawnPoint.transform.position,spawnPoint.transform.rotation as GameObject             spawnedPrefab.GetComponentltMeshFiltergt.meshimportedMesh             spawnedPrefab.GetComponentltRenderergt.material.color  new ColorRandom.value, Random.value, Random.value, 1.0f                    private struct meshStruct              public Vector3[] vertices         public Vector3[] normals         public Vector2[] uv         public Vector2[] uv1         public Vector2[] uv2         public int[] triangles         public int[] faceVerts         public int[] faceUVs         public Vector3[] faceData         public string name         public string fileName            Use this for initialization     public Mesh ImportFile string filePath         meshStruct newMesh  createMeshStructfilePath         populateMeshStructref newMesh          Vector3[] newVerts  new Vector3[newMesh.faceData.Length]         Vector2[] newUVs  new Vector2[newMesh.faceData.Length]         Vector3[] newNormals  new Vector3[newMesh.faceData.Length]         int i  0          The following foreach loops through the facedata and assigns the appropriate vertex, uv, or normal           for the appropriate Unity mesh array.                   foreach Vector3 v in newMesh.faceData                      newVerts[i]  newMesh.vertices[intv.x  1]             if v.y gt 1                 newUVs[i]  newMesh.uv[intv.y  1]              if v.z gt 1                 newNormals[i]  newMesh.normals[intv.z  1]             i                   Mesh mesh  new Mesh          mesh.vertices  newVerts         mesh.uv  newUVs         mesh.normals  newNormals         mesh.triangles  newMesh.triangles          mesh.RecalculateBounds         mesh.Optimize           return mesh           private int TotalLinesstring filePath              using StreamReader r  new StreamReaderfilePath                      int i  0             while r.ReadLine  null                              i                          return i                    private static meshStruct createMeshStructstring filename              int triangles  0         int vertices  0         int vt  0         int vn  0         int face  0         meshStruct mesh  new meshStruct         mesh.fileName  filename           Read and retrieve all the text in the file.

Negative 10593 pIve been reading about and trying to use the CKSubscription feature for weeks, but I cant find info about some general questions.

What is the purpose of the subscriptionID The convenience init does not include it, so why is it needed in the designated init If you use it, is it the same for all users of the appp  p2. I saw someone mention here that you can unregister a subscriptionID. Why or how would you do thisp  p3. Can subscriptions be setup in both public or the users private databasep  p4. If I have a query based subscription that is the same for all users, will there only ever be 1 subscription listed in the databasep  pFor instance, Im having trouble getting notifications to work with my  specific use case.  Its not a problem in my setup, as I can get a True predicate to work and the notification comes. So I must not understand the fundamentals of how subscriptions work still. p  pIm trying to setup a subscription that fires whenever a new record is created when a different user makes a comment on a post. This new record will then contain a reference to the user who created the post. The only subscription I see in the database for both users is  Notifications.user equals reference.  So, Im assuming Ill only ever see this one subscription. But how does the server keep track of every users recordID or know when to send it to a specific devicep  pThe problem is I cant get the notification to work. I manually add a record in the dashboard, and I put the other users recordID as the CKReference. While Im adding the record, I have the app running in the background on a device under the users account whom I added as the CKReference in the field. Id expect the query to trigger and send a push notification since someone commented on this users post. p  pHeres my code to setup the subscription p  precodefunc subscribeuserID CKRecordID        let options  CKSubscriptionOptions.FiresOnRecordCreation      let userRef  CKReferencerecordID userID, action .DeleteSelf     let predicate  NSPredicateformat userRef  , userRef     let predicateTwo  NSPredicateformat read  ,      let compoundPred  NSCompoundPredicatetype .AndPredicateType, subpredicates [predicate, predicateTwo]      let subscription  CKSubscriptionrecordType Notifications, predicate compoundPred, subscriptionID subscriptionID,         options options     subscription.notificationInfo  CKNotificationInfo     subscription.notificationInfo.desiredKeys  [userPost]     subscription.notificationInfo.alertBody  Someone replied to your Pod post      publicDB.saveSubscriptionsubscription, completionHandler           subscription, error in          if error  nil               printlnerror subscribing error           else               printlnsubscribed                  codepre

The modified value is displayed correctly inside the component, but remains unmodified in the controller.p  pPlaying around with modifier buttons reveals that Ember expects the property set to be the property returned, at least as far as bindings are concerned.

I am stuck at one of the bugs related to user session handling. p  pCurrently, the user logs in to the app and does the transactions, but if the user kills the app without logging out, then the app should automatically log himher out when relaunched freshlyby which i mean NOT RESUMED FROM THE BACKGROUND. I have researched a lot about it for iOS application but have hardly found any solution for Titanium. p  pI have tried pause and resume event listeners but they are for, if the app is running in the background. But what I want is, if the user swipe closes the app then it should log out the user automatically.p  pThanks in advance for any help p
Negative 10593 pIm a .net developer with no perl experience. I have to set up a perl script as a scheduled task on my companys 64bit Windows Server 2012. The script was written by another department in the company, and now my department has to take over handling it. Strawberry Perl 64bit 5.20.2.164bit is installed on the server. Ive managed to figure out how to install perl, change the info in the program, etc, so that it all points to the new server. p  pWhen I try to run the script, I get this error when the program tries to read data from a csv and upsert it to a database IOHandlesync not implemented on this architecture.p  pIOHandle is installed on the server, but I cant install IOHandlesync. I think it has something to do with the server being 64bitp  pI dont know enough about perl to feel comfortable changing the script to use a different module, and I dont have enough time to learn the language before this has to be set up. Is there anything I can do to make IOHandlesync work on this system Can I install 32bit Strawberry Perl on the 64bit server and if so, would that solve the problemp  pHeres the function that Im having problems withp  precode Convert CSV data file to bulk insert format. sub convertdatafile       my omnituredbh, omnituremappings, feed, file, basename, table, rsid     Open CSV data file. print Processing data file file open my in, ltencodingutf8, file or die file n   Remember start time. my start  time   Discard byteorder mark if present. seek in, 0, 0 if sysread in, , 1 and  ne xFEFF   Initialize CSV parser. my csv  TextCSVXSgtnew binary gt 1, autodiag gt 2, allowloosequotes gt 1, allowlooseescapes gt 1, allowwhitespace gt 1    Read header row from CSV data file. my header  csvgtgetlinein or die Header line missingn   CSV row. my row     Bind CSV data to hash elements by header field name. csvgtbindcolumnsrowheader   Map CSV fields to database columns. my columnsource, hooks  mapcsvfields omnituredbh, omnituremappings, feed, header, row   Map database columns for bulk insert. my fields  mapdatabasecolumns omnituredbh, table, row, basename, rsid, feedgtfeedversion, columnsource   Use .data extension for bulk insert data file. my bulkinsertfile  basename.data   Open bulk insert data file. open my out, gtencodingUCS2LE, bulkinsertfile or die bulkinsertfile n   Write ByteOrder Mark BOM. print out xFEFF   Record counter. my records  0   Read data rows from CSV data file. while csvgtgetlinein       Call hooks as necessary.     gt foreach hooks       Create bulk insert data record from mapped data values.       join , map    fields       Unescape hex escapes.     sx[AFaf09]2pack C, hex 1eg       Strip ASCII control codes except newlinetab and invalid UCS2 characters.             no warnings        trntx0020xd7ffxe000xffffcd            Unescape backslashes, newlines and tabs.     snt1g       Write data record and record terminator to bulk insert data file.     print out n       Increment record counter.     records      Close CSV data file.  close in or die file     Flush output buffers.  outgtflush    Sync file to disk.  outgtsync    Close bulk insert data file.  close out or die bulkinsertfile     Print informational message.  printf  d records converted .2f seconds, records, time  start     Return variables of interest.  return columnsource, bulkinsertfile, records  codepre

In the nib, I need to set Files Owner class to a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibrarymacdocumentationCocoaReferenceQCPlugInViewControllerClassindex.htmlapplerefoccclQCPlugInViewController relnofollowQCPlugInViewControllera.

Negative 10593 pso I am making a game for IOS using xcode and spriteKit. Essentially what I am trying to do is have a bullet shoot out from the tip of a dynamic gun that randomly moves and rotates. I am having difficulty positioning the bullet node such that it appears at the tip of the gun, regardless of the orientation or position of the gun. p  pThe solution I have though of is to add an arbitrary node to the gun node itself and position it in the correct place on the gun then try and set the position of the bullet to match this arbitrary node. However, when I run the codep  precodebulletnode.position  arbitrarynode.position codepre  pit instead positions the bulletnode at the position of the arbitrary node relative to the gun and I instead want the position of the arbitrary node relative to the scene. in my code below it will position the bullet at the point 70,27p  pSo ensentially my question is if there is a certain command that returns the position of a strongchild nodestrong relative to the scene as opposed to its parent.p  pThank you for the help it is much appretiatedp  pThe following is my code the arbitrarynode is named gunTestingPointp  precodevoidspawnGun    gun  [SKSpriteNode spriteNodeWithImageNamedgun] gun.physicsBody  [SKPhysicsBody bodyWithTexturegun.texture sizegun.texture.size] gun.physicsBody.dynamic  YES gun.physicsBody.frictionNO gun.physicsBody.categoryBitMask  enemyCategory gun.physicsBody.contactTestBitMask  heroCategory gun.physicsBody.collisionBitMask  0 gun.name  gun  int sideNum  [self getRanNum10] int directionDeg gunIsOnScreen  TRUE   deals with the placement of enemies ifsideNumlt3     gun.position  CGPointMake[self getRanNumself.frame.size.width], self.frame.size.height20     directionDeg  [self getRanNum180]180     movingUp  FALSE else ifsideNumlt6     gun.position  CGPointMake[self getRanNumself.frame.size.width], 10     directionDeg  [self getRanNum180]     movingUp  TRUE  else ifsideNum6     gun.position  CGPointMakeself.frame.size.width15, [self getRanNumself.frame.size.height]     directionDeg  [self getRanNum180]90     if directionDeg lt 270 movingUp  TRUE     else movingUp  FALSE   else if sideNum 7     gun.position  CGPointMake15, [self getRanNumself.frame.size.height]     directionDeg  [self getRanNum180]270     ifdirectionDeg gt 360 movingUp  TRUE     else movingUp  FALSE  else ifsideNum 8     gun.position  CGPointMakeself.frame.size.width0.5, self.frame.size.height10     directionDeg  [self getRanNum180]180     movingUp  FALSE  else     gun.position  CGPointMakeself.frame.size.width0.5, 10     directionDeg  70[self getRanNum40]     movingUp  TRUE    CGVector gunDirection  degreesToVectordirectionDeg  [mainLayer addChildgun]  gunTestingPoint  [SKSpriteNode spriteNodeWithImageNamedblackCircle] [gun addChildgunTestingPoint] gunTestingPoint.xScale  0.1 gunTestingPoint.yScale  0.1 gunTestingPoint.position  CGPointMake70, 27   SKAction gunMove   [SKAction moveBygunDirection duration0.007]0.007 [gun runAction[SKAction repeatActionForevergunMove]]  bulletSpawnDelayTimer  [NSTimer scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval2.5 targetself selectorselectorspawnBullet userInfonil repeatsNO] 2    voidspawnBullet NSLogd,gunIsOnScreen  if gunIsOnScreenTRUE ampampgun.position.x gt 0ampampgun.position.xltself.frame.size.widthampampgun.position.ygt0ampampgun.position.yltself.frame.size.height     bulletNode  [SKSpriteNode spriteNodeWithImageNamedbulletSmall] bulletNode.physicsBody  [SKPhysicsBody bodyWithTexturebulletNode.texture sizebulletNode.texture.size] bulletNode.physicsBody.dynamicYES bulletNode.physicsBody.frictionNO bulletNode.physicsBody.allowsRotationNO bulletNode.physicsBody.categoryBitMask  enemyCategory bulletNode.physicsBody.contactTestBitMask  heroCategory bulletNode.physicsBody.collisionBitMask  0 bulletNode.physicsBody.usesPreciseCollisionDetection  YES bulletNode.name  bullet      bulletNode.zRotation  gun.zRotationMPI     bulletNode.position  gunTestingPoint.position     [self addGunshot gunTestingPoint.position]        change position of bullet later      CGVector rotationVector      rotationVector  radiansToVectorgun.zRotation     bulletNode.physicsBody.velocity  CGVectorMakerotationVector.dx270, rotationVector.dy270 [mainLayer addChildbulletNode]     gunIsOnScreen  FALSE    codepre

Negative 10593 pHow can I convert Plain Text .txt files to a string if the encoding type is unknownp  pIm working on a feature that would allow users to import txt files into my app. This means the file could have been created in any number of apps, utilizing any of a variety of encodings that would be considered valid for a plain text file.

Negative 10593 pI have an Ubuntu 14.04 LTS server running a few different programs under Supervisor. Many of the programs need to store sockets and other named pipes on the filesystem, and coderuncode seems like the ideal choice for these types of files. Unfortunately, coderuncode is tmpfs and removed on every reboot, and root privileges are needed to recreate the directories that each program can write to.p  pI need a way to create a few subdirectories in coderuncode and set the ownermode to something that each program can work with, and do so on each reboot before Supervisor tries to start them. It does not look like Supervisor supports a mechanism to run prestart commands before it starts a program.p  pMost other answers for this type of question suggest doing it in the init script, but that belongs to Supervisors package and I do not want to mess with it or have to maintain it when it changes upstream.p  pIf this machine had Systemd it seems like I could use codeetctmpfiles.dcode, but it does not.p  pThe best idea I came up with was to use a separate Upstart codeprestartcode script for each program that only creates the directories without actually launching any processes. Something likep  petcinitmyapp1.confp  precodestart on runlevel [2345]  prestart script     mkdir p m 0755 varrunmyapp1     chown app1user varrunmyapp1 end script codepre  p...without any codeexeccode line.

Negative 10593 pI am building a StackList. Which is a linkedlist of StackNodes. Each stack on StackNode is of constant size it is an int array.

I want to remove the element at index  25. Which means it is at 2ed StackNode of my StackList and 4th index in that StackNodes stack.

Is it possible to do this without iterating through the arraya stack on each StackNode because if I have n number of StackNode then I need to iterate thorough n  stack size. i.e. if my 3ed stack start at 0x8000 then actualy data starts at 0x8004 since I remove the first element and appended it to end of 2nd stack. So I need to put value 0x8004 to 0x8000 and so on until 0x8028 to 0x8024, then continue doing that for all other stacks. Is there a better solution than using a for loop to move every element.

Negative 10593 pIm working on a challenge from an online coding community. The object is to write a function that generate exact change from highest to lowestusing the denominations shown in the CID array cash in drawer. The function takes three arguments, price, cash, cid. Cid is cash in drawer.p  pIm trying to compare the cash amounts of the denominations in cid against the cash amounts of an exact change computation.p  pFor example, if change  96, then exact change from highest to  lowest would be p  precode[twenty, 80], [ten, 1], [five, 1], [one, 1] codepre  p. However, if CID shows [twenty, 60], [ten, 20], [five, 55] then the code must compute exact change using the amount in cid.

Negative 10593 pI am having trouble with figuring out how to use codengrepeatcode and codengifcode with JSON.

Negative 10593 pIm working on a site where the content has been important from an old site with a different domain. About half of the images have relative paths which work well. The other half have absolute paths hard coded in with the old domain. The old site has been taken down, so those images no longer work. These images did get imported however, and exist on the new server. Changing those paths to relative URLs corrects the issue.p  pThe long term solution would be to work through and each and every page to remove the old domain from these image src URLs.p  pBut as a short term solution, Id like to apply a javascript or jquery workaround that will loop through each img on the page, check the url of each image, and if it contains the old domain, remove it. So far, Ive not had much success.p  pHeres my sample HTMLp  precodeltpgtltimg srcsomepicture.jpggtltpgt lt this works gt ltpgtltimg srchttpswww.oldwebsitedomain.comsomeotherpicture.jpggtltpgt lt this doesnt gt codepre  pHeres the javascriptjquery that Ive written upp  precodeimg.eachfunction      if this.attrsrc.indexOfoldwebsitedomain.com gt 1          this.attrsrc.replacehttpswww.oldwebsitedomain.com,           codepre  pIf I console.log this, I am getting all of the img objects on the page properly. And if I console log this.attrsrc I get the URL of each image. I can verify that my if statement evaluates to true on the correct image URLs, but the trouble comes inside the if statement. The replace doesnt seem to run, and the addresses for the images arent modified.p  pWhat am I missingp
Negative 10593 pIn my application, I have a list of codeltselectgtcode controls. Change of selection in each of these controls can be made emonlyem after user confirmation. So I deal with it as followsp  precodeltselect onchangechangeSelectthis onmousedownclickSelectthisgt     ltoption value1 selectedtruegtAltoptiongt  here is default value 1     ltoption value2 gtBltoptiongt ltselectgt  ltselect onchangechangeSelectthis onmousedownclickSelectthisgt     ltoption value1 gtAltoptiongt     ltoption value2 selectedtruegtBltoptiongt  here is default value 2 ltselectgt   more select controls with arbitrary default values, they can be added and removed dynamically codepre  pWhen the user clicks the select to choose another option, the codeclickSelectthiscode method saves the currently chosen old selectionp  precodefunction clickSelectselect      globalScope.previouslySelected  select.val  codepre  pAnd now, if the user really tries to change the selection, I ask the user for confirmation, and if she does not confirm, I use the saved value to restore the previous statep  precodefunction changeSelectselect      var response  confirmCurrent changes to the threat log will be lost. Continue anyway         if response  false               change it back             select.valglobalScope.previouslySelected             return                codepre  pNow, on IE, Chrome and Opera it works just fine. However, when I use Firefox, it does not work. THe reason is that FF calls the codeonmousedowncode handler twice during the selection  first time when the user clicks to roll down the select control, and second time when she selects a new selection. Therefore the last remembered value of codeglobalScope.previouslySelectedcode will become the new selected value and not really the old one, as in other browsers.p  pI know using global variables is considered bad practice. This is not the issue here. Using any other storage will not make it work.p  pMy only idea right now is to write a Firefox specific piece of code in the codeclickSelectselectcode handler and ignore the second notification. However, for some reason the following code I found on stack overflow does not workp  precodeif.browser.mozilla       console.logOlalala  codepre  pE.g., in Chrome it throws following exceptionp  precodeUncaught TypeError Cannot read property mozilla of undefined codepre  pSo how can I make it work so that ti would only run in FF Or if any of you guys have a better solution to the problem of confirmation, I would gladly hear it. Just remember, there is a dynamic set of select controls, not just a single one. It has to work for all of them. Plus they can be added or removed dynamically, so in a single page request their number can vary. User loads page with a single select control, presses a  button and adds another select control, etc., but the solution has to work uniformly with all the controls.p

Negative 10593 pI have c code with embedded SQL for Oracle through ProC. p  pWhenever I do an insert or update below given an update example,p  precodeupdate TBL1 set COL1  v, . . . where rowid  v codepre  pTo manage bulk insertions and updates, I have allocated several memory chunks to insert as bulk and commit once. There are other memory allocations too going on as and when necessary. How do I better manage the memory heap for dynamic memory allocations One option is to have the heap size configurable during  the GNU linking time. Im using g version 2.95, I know its quite an old version, but have to use this for legacy. Since the executable runs on solaris 10, obce built, could run on several production environments with varied resources, onesizefitall for heap size allocation may not be appropriate. As an alternative, need some mechanism where heaps may elastically grow as and when needed. Unlike Linux, Solaris, I think, does not have the concept of overallocated memory. So, memory allocations could fail with ENOMEM if there is no more space left. What could be better strategy to know that we could be crossing the danger level and now we should either deallocate chunks that we are storing in case these are done using or transfer memory chunks to oracle DB in case these are still pending to be loaded and finally deallocate. Any strategy that you could suggestp
