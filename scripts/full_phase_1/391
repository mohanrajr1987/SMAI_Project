Positive 391 pWhen giving a talk I usually use two screens One is the wall showing the presentation to the audience, the other one is my Laptop screen with a mirror of the presentation, my speakernotes etc.  During the talks I pretty often do demos using a terminal. This requires that I turn around to check at the wall if everything works correctly. To avoid this I would like to have two terminal window, one on my laptop screen where I am typing and a mirror of it which is shown to the audience at the second screen. How can I do this p
Positive 391 pThis is a python question, but also a linuxBSD question.p  pI have a python script with two threads, one downloading data from the web and the other sending data to a device over a serial port. Both of these threads print a lot of status information to stdout using pythons codeloggingcode module.p  pWhat I would like is to have two terminal windows open, side by side, and have each terminal window show the output from one thread, rather than have the messages from both interleaved in a single window.p  pAre there file descriptors other than stdin, stdout amp stderr to write to and connect to other terminal windows Perhaps this wish is better fulfilled with a GUI p  pIm not sure how to get started with this.p  pedit Ive tried writing status messages to two different files instead of printing them to stdout, and then monitoring these two files with codetail fcode in other terminal windows, but this doesnt work for live monitoring because the files arent written to until you call codeclosecode on them.p

Positive 391 pI am writing a C program, which runs a long data analysis algorithm. It takes several days to finish running, so it is useful to have a prompt which outputs the percentage complete every time a new loop in the program starts so that the user me knows the computer isnt sitting in an infinite loop somewhere or has crashed.p  pAt the moment I am doing this the most basic way, by computing the percentage complete as a floating point number and doingp  precodestdcout ltlt Percentage complete  ltlt percentagecomplete ltlt   ltlt stdendl codepre  pBut, when the program has a million loops to run, this is kind of messy. In addition, if the terminal scrollback is only 1000 lines, then I lose the initial debug info printed out at the start once the program is 0.1  complete.p  pI would like to copy an idea I have seen in other programs, where instead of writing a new line each time with the percentage complete, I simply replace the last line written to the terminal with the new percentage complete.p  pHow can I do this Is that possible And if so, can this be done in a cross platform way Are there several methods of doing thisp  pI am unsure how to describe what I am trying to do perfectly clearly, so I hope that this clear enough that you understand what I am trying to do.p  pTo clarify, rather than seeing thisp  precodeRunning program.

Negative 391 pI have a clientserver app where the client is on a Windows Mobile 6 device, written in C and the server is on full Windows and written in C. p  pOriginally, I only needed it to send messages from the client to the server, with the server only ever sending back an acknowledgment that it received the message.  Now, I would like to update it so that the server can actually send a message to the client to request data.  As I currently have it set up so the client is only in receive mode after it sends data to the server, this doesnt allow for the server to send a request at any time.  I would have to wait for client data.  My first thought would be to create another thread on the client with a separate open socket, listening for server requests...just like the server already has in respect the the client.

Negative 391 pI have an application where the memory profile looks something like thisp  pimg srchttpkupio.comimagedumpspikeymem.png altJaggy p  pThe slow upwards crawl of memory usage is caused by the allocation of lots and lots of small, simple, transient objects. In lowmemory situations This is a mobile app the GC overhead is noticeable when compared to less restrictive memory amounts.p  pSince we know, due to the nature of the app, that these spikes will just keep on coming, I was considering some sort of pool of multitudinous transient objects Awesome name. These objects would live for the lifetime of the app and be reused wherever possible Where the lifetime of the object is short and highly predictable.p  pHopefully this would mitigate against the effects of GC by reducing the number of objects collected and improve performance.p  pObviously this would also have its own performance limits since allocation would be more expensive and there would be an overhead in maintaining the cache itself.p  pSince this would be a rather large and intrusive change into a large amount of code, I was wondering if anyone had tried something similar and if it was a benefit, or if there were any other known ways of mitigating against GC in this sort of situation. Ideas for efficient ways to manage a cache of reusable objects are also welcome.p

Negative 391 pI always come to the same problem when implementing new data object that some web site will use. It seem to me naturaly to fill the object ...p  precodeobject news news subobjects mediaItems, user, category codepre  pI usualy implement lazy loading of associated objects lists of objects and also have a static method to fill the news object data, media and category at oncefrom a joined sql query, as lazy loading requeres 3 queries. But sometimes, actualy quite common, I need extra parameters, for a specific view or aggregation, fetched beside the news object. To get this parameter, I would use a new sql query. At the same time I know I could have used one more complexed query to fetch the news object with this parameter included.p  pMy question basicaly is Do I do fetch data as a row of items and pass it to the view in the later case, or accomodate the news object with special loading and handling of the added parameter, needed only in this view and only for display.p

Negative 391 pIm working on a Java web application Adobe Flex frontend, JPAHibernateBlazeDSSpring MVC backend and will soon reach the point where I can no longer wipe the database and regenerate it.p  pWhats the best approach for handling changes to the DB schema The production and test databases are SQL Server 2005, devs use MySQL, and unit tests run against an HSQLDB inmemory database. Im fine with having dev machines continue to wipe and reload the DB from sample data using Hibernate to regenerate the tables. However, for a production deploy the DBA would like to have a DDL script that he can manually execute.p  pSo, my ideal solution would be one where I can write Railsstyle migrations, execute them against the test servers, and after verifying that they work be able to write out SQL Server DDL that the DBA can execute on the production servers and which has already been validated to work agains the test servers.p  pWhats a good tool for this Should I be writing the DDL manually and just let dev machines use Hibernate to regenerate the DB Can I use a tool like migrate4j which seems to have limited support for SQL Server, if at all p  pIm also looking to integrate DB manipulation scripts into this process for example, converting a Name field into a First Name, Last Name field via a JDBC script that splits all the existing strings.p  pAny suggestions would be much appreciatedp

Negative 391 pI have an ArrayList to store some data, but whenever I remove an item from the list, the size does not decrease, even when I call ArrayList.trimToSize. This is causing me nullPointerExceptions.p  pHow can I remove a single item from an ArrayList and have the lists size shrink accordinglyp  pEDIT All right, heres the code. Heres a bit of background youll need to know, since I cant post all the code. I have an ArrayList called dataHeap and a HashMap called dataMap. The ArrayList is a binary Heap containing a findable object, which has a Key. The HashMap bind from a Key to the index of the object in the ArrayList. This is so an item in the queue can be found by item using the HashMap or by index using ArrayList. The Key can be any Object, as long as it is unique for every item in the queue.p  pIve debugged this line by line, and the Heap contains the object, even down to the Hashcode. The problem is, the Object is never being removed from the ArrayList. This must mean that dataMap.getelement.getKey is not pointing to where it should. Ive checked it though, I used a test object outside of my implementation that maps from a String to a custom object with String as a Key.p  pI make one object, with String one as its key. I insert it, then try to remove it. Ive stepped through this, and everything checks out, except one thing The object is never removed from the queue. Its got the same Hashcode, the same Key, everything. It gets removed from the map just fine, but not from the ArrayList.p  pHeres the remove methodp  precodepublic T removeT element      Well need this data to return the proper value     T t  dataHeap.getdataMap.getelement.getKey            this Swap call is used to swap our target with the end       of the arraylist. This means that whenever we remove it,       we dont have a change in indexes of the other nodes.       After that, we downHeapify to fix the whole graph back       to its functional state.           swapdataMap.getelement.getKey,length1     Remove from the Heap     dataHeap.removedataMap.getelement.getKey     dataHeap.trimToSize     Remove from the Map     dataMap.removeelement.getKey     downHeapify     return t codepre  pI hope this gives you a better idea of what Im doing wrong.p  pEDIT THE SECOND Holy crap I finally fixed it I pulled the dataHeap.getelement.index into its own variable. That solved EVERYTHINGp

Negative 391 pI am trying to figure out the equivalent of foreign keys and indexes in NoSQL KVP or Document databases. Since there are no pivotal tables to add keys marking a relation between two objects I am really stumped as to how you would be able to retrieve data in a way that would be useful for normal web pages.p  pSay I have a user, and this user leaves many comments all over the site. The only way I can think of to keep track of that users comments is to 1 Embed them in the user object which seems quite useless 2 create and maintain a codeuseridcommentscode value that contains a list of each comments key [comment34, comment197, etc...] so that that I can fetch them as needed.p  pHowever, taking the second example you will soon hit a brick wall when you use it for tracking other things like a key called activecomments which might contain 30 million ids in it making it emcost a TONem to query each page just to know some recent active comments. It also would be very prone to emraceconditionsem as many pages might try to update it at the same time.p  pstrongHow can I track relations like the following in a NoSQL databasestrongp  ul liAll of a users commentsli liAll active commentsli liAll posts tagged with [keyword]li liAll students in a club  or all clubs a student is inli ul  pemOr am I thinking about this incorrectlyemp
Negative 391 pFor the last couple of days, I have been on a jQuery frenzy literally designing everything using this wonderful library. I am planning to design a webbased social game for deployment on social networks like Facebook from scratch and would like some pointers on understanding how to divide the tasks i.e. to what extent should jQuery be used. Following are my thoughts. Please let me know if I am heading in the right direction.p  pI am envisioning the game to be a simple multiplayer game where users can compete with each other and gain points and the game is more like rolebased or static rather than a dynamic mario style game. For this most of the pointslogic and book keeping should be done on the server side using PHP and MySQL. For client side rendering, I am planning to use jQuery and have no plans of taking the Flash route. So all the interactions will be handled on the client side using jQuery and the state will be saved on the server. p  pNow, this is a very naive process but I was wondering if there are any resources that explain the above in more detailed steps i.e. from the perspective of designing an actual game from a multiplayer perspective keeping scalability in mind. I dont need a very complex game... even a simple QampA game will suffice to boost my understanding of how to actually use these languages to create a good enough game. Any suggestions Also, is it recommended to use a gaming engine when doing the game in jQueryp

It doesnt have any mention of how to set up number of blocks and threads for when you have soemthing 2D.p  pI am thinking Id actually need to set it up like so, and this is where Id like someone to chime in and helpp  precodenumthreads1024 blocksX  numcolssqrtnumthreads blocksY  numrowssqrtnumthreads numblocks  numrowsnumcolsblocksXblocksY  dim3 dimBlockblocksX, blocksY, 1 dim3 dimGridnumblocks, 1, 1 codepre  pDoes this seem to make sense for the setupp  pAnd then in the kernel, to work on a particular row or column, id have to use p  prowidx  blockIdx.xblockDim.xthreadId.x colidx  blockIdx.yblockDim.ythreadId.yp  pAt least I think that would work for getting a row and column. p  pHow would I then access that particular row r and column c in the kernel In the cuda programming guide I found the following codep  precode Host code int width  64, height  64 float devPtr sizet pitch cudaMallocPitchampdevPtr, amppitch, width  sizeoffloat, height MyKernelltltlt100, 512gtgtgtdevPtr, pitch, width, height  Device code global void MyKernelfloat devPtr, sizet pitch, int width, int height  for int r  0 r lt height r  float row  floatchardevPtr  r  pitch for int c  0 c lt width c  float element  row[c]    codepre  pWhich looks similar to how youd use malloc in C to declare a 2D array, but it doesnt have any mention of accessing that array in your own kernel. I guess in my code, I will use that cudaMallocPitch call, and then perform a memcpy to get my data into the 2D array on the devicep  pAny tips appreciated Thanks p

Negative 391 pIm trying to come up with a way to define dynamic mixins at compile time. I currently have a very hacky solution that only partially does what I want, but Im not sure how to improve it.p  pIm aware of some more C like solutions using typelists, but they require all of the types to be defined statically which Im trying to avoid.  p  pThis is mostly just a thought exercise to learn C better, and Im sure that my current implementation is not very good C.  Any suggestions for improvements or different ideas to try would be welcome.p  pThe main problems with my current implementation arep  ul liEach mixin class is only aware of itself and classes lower then itself in the hierarchy.

In the example code below Id like codePrintOncecode to be able to have a method which returns a codePrintTwiceltPrintOnceltPrinterltint gt gt gtcode object.li liAny usage of this idea would need to have an order of header inclusion.  All the boiler plate code in the beginning would need to be in one header, then all of the mixin classes would need to be defined, and finally the codemakemixedcode function could be defined.  Currently any mixin defined after the codemakemixedcode function is ignored.  li liThe macros and general hackyness of the implementation.li ul  pI apologize for the length, but this is the most simplified example I could come up with.p  pThanks for any help.p  precodeinclude ltstringgt include ltvectorgt include ltiostreamgt  using namespace std  templateltclass Underlyinggt struct Printer      Printerconst Underlying ampval  valval       Underlying getval  return val     private     Underlying val   define CURRENTNUMBERMIXEDINCLASSES      MixinCountlt0, LINEgtvalue  define INCREMENTMIXINCLASSCOUNTER      templateltint idgt                                                    struct MixinClassCounterlt CURRENTNUMBERMIXEDINCLASSES, idgt                                                                                     static const bool isdefined  true                                   templatelt bool b, typename i, typename j gt struct selectvalue  templateltclass i, class jgt struct selectvaluelttrue, i, jgt      static const int value  ivalue   templateltclass i, class jgt struct selectvalueltfalse, i, jgt      static const int value  jvalue   templateltint igt struct IntToVal      static const int value  i   namespace      templateltint count, int idgt     struct MixinClassCounter              static const bool isdefined  false           templateltint count, int idgt     struct MixinCount              static const int value  selectvalueltMixinClassCounterltcount, idgtisdefined,                                               MixinCountltcount  1, idgt,                                               IntToValltcountgt gtvalue           templateltclass Underlying, int igt     struct MixinBuilder       templateltclass Underlyinggt     struct MixinBuilderltUnderlying, 0gt              typedef PrinterltUnderlyinggt type          INCREMENTMIXINCLASSCOUNTER   define DECLAREMIXINBEGINname      templateltclass Basegt      struct name  Base                                     templateltclass Underlyinggt                           nameconst Underlying ampval  Baseval   define DECLAREMIXINENDname                                                                     namespace                                                                                                templateltclass Underlyinggt                                                  struct MixinBuilderltUnderlying, CURRENTNUMBERMIXEDINCLASSESgt                                                                                          typedef namelt typename MixinBuilderltUnderlying, CURRENTNUMBERMIXEDINCLASSES  1gttype gt type                                                                                     INCREMENTMIXINCLASSCOUNTER                                                                                                                   DECLAREMIXINBEGINPrintOnce void printonce      cout ltlt Basegetval ltlt endl  DECLAREMIXINENDPrintOnce  DECLAREMIXINBEGINPrintTwice void printtwice      cout ltlt Basegetval ltlt endl     cout ltlt Basegetval ltlt endl  DECLAREMIXINENDPrintTwice  templateltclass Tgt typename MixinBuilderltT, CURRENTNUMBERMIXEDINCLASSES  1gttype makemixedconst T ampval      return typename MixinBuilderltT, CURRENTNUMBERMIXEDINCLASSES  1gttypeval   int main      string testthis is a test     auto printablestring  makemixedtest      printablestring.printonce     printablestring.printtwice  codepre

Negative 391 pSo I have an autocomplete field where a user can select an existing or create a new tag. If a user creates a new tag, he presses the form button, and it sends a POST request to the update action in the videos controller which processes the request as AJAX, and the tag gets displayed above the field.p  pNow, the problem is when a user selects a tag from the suggestion list. By default, the jQuery UI autocomplete plugin appends the selected element inside the field, and then the user has to press the form button. However, I want to save the user some effort by automatically adding the tag right when its picked from the suggested list. Therefore, I have this code in my application.js filep  precodeselect functionevent, ui             var url  .editvideo.attraction            var val  ui.item.topic.name            .ajaxtypePUT, urlurl, datavideotopicnamesval            return false          codepre  pThat successfully sends a PUT request to the update action when an element is selected from the list. However, the request is NOT processed as AJAX. The tag is successfully added, but only after a page refresh. I want the request to be processed as AJAX. How can I do thisp  pIm guessing that the problem has to do with the fact that when you press the form button, the coderemote gt truecode option tells rails to look for codeformat.jscode which I have in my update action, but when the button is not pressed, and an element is selected from the list, Rails does not know to look for JS. How do I let it knowp

Negative 391 pI read somewhere that the Salesforce API has a 10 request limit. If we write code to integrate with Salesforce  1. What is the risk of this limit 2. How can we write code to negate this risk p  pMy real concern is that I dont want to build our customer this great standalone website that integrates with Salesforce only to have user 11 and 12 kicked out to wait until requests 110 are complete p  pEdit  Some more details on the specifics of the limitation can be found at a hrefhttpwww.salesforce.comusdeveloperdocsapiContentimplementationconsiderations.htm relnofollowhttpwww.salesforce.comusdeveloperdocsapiContentimplementationconsiderations.htma. Look at the section titled limits.p  pstrongemLimitsstrong There is a limit on the number of queries that a user can execute concurrently. A user can have up to 10 query cursors open at a time. If 10 QueryLocator cursors are open when a client application, logged in as the same user, attempts to open a new one, then the oldest of the 10 cursors is released. This results in an error in the client application. Multiple client applications can log in using the same username argument. However, this increases your risk of getting errors due to query limits. If multiple client applications are logged in using the same user, they all share the same session. If one of the client applications calls logout, it invalidates the session for all the client applications. Using a different user for each client application makes it easier to avoid these limits.emp

Negative 391 pI found the concept as in a paper on dynamic instrumentation. But I couldnt find the explanation of this concept. Please explain, if possible... p  pEDIT or is there any tutorial on how to achieve lightweight dynamic instrumentation in user space, for syscalls and normal function callsp  pEDITAdded paper detailsp  pA code generation approach to optimizing highperformance distributed data stream processingp  pa hrefhttpportal.acm.orgcitation.cfmid1645953.1646061 relnofollowAbstractap  blockquote   pWe present a codegenerationbased   optimization approach to bringing   performance and scalability to   distributed stream processing   applications. We express stream   processing applications using an   operatorbased, streamcentric   language called SPADE, which supports   composing distributed data flow graphs   out of toolkits of typegeneric   operators. A major challenge in   building such applications is to find   an effective and flexible way of   mapping the logical graph of operators   into a physical one that can be   deployed on a set of distributed   nodes. This involves finding how best   operators map to processes and how   best processes map to computing nodes.   In this paper, we take a twostage   optimization approach, where an   instrumented version of the   application is first generated by the   SPADE compiler to profile and collect   statistics about the processing and   communication characteristics of the   operators within the application. In   the second stage, the profiling   information is fed to an optimizer to   come up with a physical data flow   graph that is deployable across nodes   in a computing cluster. This approach   not only creates highly optimized   applications that are tailored to the   underlying computing and networking   infrastructure, but also makes it   possible to retarget the application   to a different hardware setup by   simply repeating the optimization step   and recompiling the application to   match the physical flow graph produced   by the optimizer. Using realworld   applications, from diverse domains   such as finance and radioastronomy,   we demonstrate the effectiveness of   our approach on System S  a   largescale, distributed stream   processing platform.p blockquote

Negative 391 pI am researching and experimenting with a ThreadLocal variable in my Java Web Application.  I am using the ThreadLocal variable to store a username collected from the session before a request, and then removing it after the request.

The reason I do not simply retrieve the username from the session is because I have inherited a system with longrunning processes that sometimes take longer to run than the session timeout would allow.

Negative 391 pI am writing a system whereby everything visible to the user is translatable.

For example code[Tag 1]code may be Login or it could be changed to something else  its definable by the company itself.p  pI have this working perfectly. I am overriding the Render method in the Page class to replace all these tags. I have a regex to match all tags in the format code[tag x]code where x is 1 or more numbers, i.e. the ID of the translation in the database the regex I am using is code[TextTag [09]]code.p  pThe problem I am having is that, for example, if you have a tag within a tag  for example code[tag 69]code is defined as code[tag 70][tag 71][tag 72]code  when the text is inside a textarea it is still replaced, so tag 69 will appear as the other 3 put together. Id like to prevent replacements on tags contained within textareas. My first thought was that this would be easy  but then I realised that if you had codelttextareagt[tag 1]lttextareagt[tag 2]lttextareagt[tag 3]lttextareagtcode, tag 2 would not be replaced.p  pI have to admit I am no pro at regular expressions  I would like to be but I dont have the time on my hands at the moment. Can anyone suggest a way that I could achieve what Id like to achieve Thanks in advance.p  pRegards, Richardp

Negative 391 pHeres my situation.  I have a table with a bunch of URLs and crawl dates associated with them.  When my program processes a URL, I want to INSERT a new row with a crawl date.  If the URL already exists, I want to update the crawl date to the current datetime.  With MS SQL or Oracle Id probably use a MERGE command for this.  With mySQL Id probably use the ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE syntax.p  pI could do multiple queries in my program, which may or may not be thread safe.  I could write a SQL function which has various IF...ELSE logic.  However, for the sake of trying out Postgres features Ive never used before, Im thinking about creating an INSERT rule  something like thisp  precodeCREATE RULE PagesUpsert AS ON INSERT TO Pages   WHERE EXISTS SELECT 1 from Pages P where NEW.Url  P.Url   DO INSTEAD      UPDATE Pages SET LastCrawled  NOW, Html  NEW.Html WHERE Url  NEW.Url codepre  pThis seems to actually work great.  It probably loses some points on the code readability standpoint, as someone looking at my code for the first time would have to magically know about this rule, but I guess that could be solved with good code commenting and documentation.p  pAre there any other drawbacks to this idea, or maybe a your idea sucks, you should do it this way instead comment  Im on PG 9.0 if that matters.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong Query plan since someone wanted it p  precodeInsert  cost2.79..2.81 rows1 width0   InitPlan 1 returns 0     gt  Seq Scan on pages p  cost0.00..2.79 rows1 width0           Filter httpwww.foo.comtext  lowerurltext   gt  Result  cost0.00..0.01 rows1 width0         OneTime Filter 0 IS NOT TRUE  Update  cost2.79..5.46 rows1 width111   InitPlan 1 returns 0     gt  Seq Scan on pages p  cost0.00..2.79 rows1 width0           Filter httpwww.foo.comtext  lowerurltext   gt  Result  cost0.00..2.67 rows1 width111         OneTime Filter 0         gt  Seq Scan on pages  cost0.00..2.66 rows1 width111               Filter urltext  httpwww.foo.comtext codepre

Negative 391 pI am using the open source jqGrid plugin with EF4 and ASP.NET Web Forms. I need to set an input element in an inlineeditable grid row based on a column value from the DB.

Negative 391 pI am developing a single page site with vertical scroll for navigation.

Negative 391 pI just noticed a rather severe bug in my iPhoneiPad app I have a class called codeAppDelegatecode that implements the codeUIApplicationDelegatecode protocol  like every iPhone app has. Im using Core Data, and the codeAppDelegatecode sets up my managed object context I mostly just left the default methods of the Xcode template in place.p  pNow I need the managed object context in a few places in my app and I would also like to call the codesaveContextcode method from a few places. So I used the singleton pattern and added a class method code AppDelegate sharedAppDelegatecode that is implemented like thisp  precode AppDelegate sharedAppDelegate      static dispatchoncet pred  0     strong static id sharedObject  nil     dispatchonceamppred,         sharedObject  [[self alloc] init]          return sharedObject  codepre  pEverything worked fine so far. Now however, I tried to access the codesharedAppDelegatecodes codeUIWindowcode property and noticed it was codenilcode. At first I was quite confused, but then I realized that first my codemaincode method creates an instance of codeAppDelegatecode, which creates the codeUIWindowcode and view controllers in codeapplicationdidFinishLaunchingWithOptionscode and then, codesharedAppDelegatecode creates emanother oneem I find it very strange that my app seemed to work quite well so far, because for instance only the first instance calls codesaveContextcode when the app exists.p  pAnyway, I would like to change it so that the codemaincode method also uses the codesharedAppDelegatecode. Does that mean that I need to override the codeinitcode method How can I prevent an infinite loop codesharedAppDelegatecode also calles init after all Should I make the codesharedObjectcode variable of global scopep

Negative 391 pIve been struggling to get to grips with implementing a multimodule ZF application. Ive found a whole bunch of resources out there about multimodule applications, and the fact that in ZF lt v2.0 the whole module thing is less than optimal. Ive come to the conclusion that for the particular implementation well be using, all the existing methods Ive read about have some kind of drawback that is a showstopper for us, so I started thinking out of the box. p  pIve come up with a solution that works, and allows multimodule isolated bootstrapping, but Id like to get some input from some ZF gurus on whether there are potentially unforseen circumstances in doing it this way.p  pThe base domain is example.org. I also have admin.example.org, dashboard.example.org and api.example.org. I want each of those subdomains to map to its namesake module subdomain admin maps to module admin, etc. I configure the Apache virtualhost with the subdomains as serveraliases.p  pThen I also define the followingp  precodeSetEnvIf Host admin MODULETOUSEadmin codepre  pThen, in index.php, I have the followingp  precode ZendConfigIni  requireonce ZendConfigIni.php  config  new ZendConfigIniAPPLICATIONPATH . configsapplication.ini, APPLICATIONENV config  configgttoArray  module  config[resources][frontController][defaultModule] ifgetenvMODULETOUSE      module  getenvMODULETOUSE     config[resources][frontController][defaultModule]  module  module  ucfirstmodule config[bootstrap][path]  APPLICATIONPATH . moduleBootstrap.php   ZendApplication  requireonce ZendApplication.php   Create application, bootstrap, and run application  new ZendApplication     APPLICATIONENV,     config  applicationgtbootstrap             gtrun codepre  pThen, instead of the usual Bootstrap.php file, I have DefaultBootstrap.php, AdminBootstrap.php, etc etc... As far as I can figure, because in this case the modules are mapped directly to the subdomains, then using logic to check for those named subdomains in the virtualhost conf or .htaccess, for that matter shouldnt break anything. But Im not a ZF guru, so I cant be sure. p  pI would appreciate any feedback. p  pNote I know they arent real subdomains, just server aliases, but Ive called them subdomains to assist with future searches, as most people will search for subdomains as opposed to serveralisesp

Negative 391 pWere building an application for product support. The idea is to have multiple subdomains, each for supporting other organizations products. We call this Account  each account is tied to exactly one subdomain. Users also have roles  but, user can have one role on account1, and other role on account2.p  pBasically, there are two problemsp  p1 many validations are based on the role current user has. Since it depends on currentaccount which is session data, I cannot do these kinds of validations in the model. This leads me to some ugly controller code ugly, in the sense that it really feels out of place. I thought of storing currentaccount after in the model class variable, but I read that this is not thread safe. Any recommendationsp  p2 almost every database record is specific to the current account so, almost every table should have an accountid column and the model should have a belongsto account association. I want to avoid that. The first obvious thing is to have a seperate database for every account, but p  pa there are shared tables p  pb the boss says this solution is unacceptable there will be many accounts, with relatively low number of users.

Negative 391 pCannot undestand main idea of identifying relationshipsp  pAn identifying relationship is when the existence of a row in a child table depends on a row in a parent table. This may be confusing because its common practice these days to create a pseudokey for a child table, but not make the foreign key to the parent part of the childs primary key. Formally, the right way to do this is to make the foreign key part of the childs primary key. But the logical relationship is that the child cannot exist without the parent.p  pExample A Person has one or more phone numbers. If they had just one phone number, we could simply store it in a column of Person. Since we want to support multiple phone numbers, we make a second table PhoneNumbers, whose primary key includes the personid referencing the Person table.p  pBut how can for example Person can have multiples phone numbers if personid is primary key Or possible personid must be part of complex primary key and cannot separately identify items in tablep

Negative 391 pI appreciate that to find the precise error I will need to provide some code, but I am not sure which part of the code is at fault. Let me know and Ill paste it up.p  pSCENARIO I have a number of SVGs that are embedded as objects. They render fine in all browsers except Firefox is starting to render XML Parsing Error junk after document element then it tells me the problem is in the svg doc, it also tells me which line and outputs some svg vector numbers.p  pWell look there then you are telling me. BUT on one computer the 4th svg produces the XML Parsing Error and the 5th svg object is fine,  and on my OTHER computer its the 5th svg object telling me to check a different document and the 4th svg object is fine. This makes me think it is the html document. p  pAnother reason for me to doubt that it is the xml code is that I didnt hand code it, it has been produced  via inkscape, and the fact that in effect each svg works in all browsers and even occasionaly in Firefox, makes me think the problem lies else where. p  pEDIT THIS PROBLEM WAS RESOLVED BY CLEARING THE CACHE. HOWEVER IF SOMEONE FEELS THAT THERE IS A MORE SERIOUS PROBLEM BEHIND THIS BEHAVIOUR PLEASE ANSWER. I CANT SEE THE CONNECTION BETWEEN CACHE AND XML PARSING AND WOULD LIKE TO KNOW.p

It got rendered fine.p  pHowever, when I tried to do something similar, I found that it wasnt getting rendered. I referred to the help document on the a hrefhttphelp.adobe.comenUSFlashPlatformreferenceactionscript3flashdisplaySimpleButton.html relnofollowAdobe Sitea and pasted their sample code as a standalone file. It worked fine. However, the button was just coloured. I wanted to add some text on it  so I used the text field and overlaid it. Which looks fine.

Negative 391 pstrongIn briefstrongbr We need to switch from mysqli to mysql.

We faced some problems because our production PHP version was 5.2.6 and TeraWurfl uses a database connector TeraWurflDatabaseMySQL5.php which uses the following thingsp  ul limysqliconnecterror, which is not supported until php 5.2.9  we use php 5.2.6 li lipersistent connections which are not supported until php 5.3.0  we use php 5.2.6 li ul  pmysqli is not fully supported until php 5.3.0.p  pSo, we have two options p  ol lipUpgrade PHP  But, that would require significant amount of Regression testing since the OpenX version that we are using does not seem to have tested against these latest PHP versions. Our systems core lies around Openx.pli lipWrite a wrapper class to have the same Object oriented API as that of MySQLi. This is looking simpler.pli ol  pSo, we have decided to estimate the effort needed to come up with a wrapper class. Here is what we thought  p  pSince PHP provides only procedural interface for its mysql extension and codeTeraWurflDatabaseMySQL5.phpcode calls mysqlis functions in an object oriented manner, we will have to create a wrapper class which will provide the same interface as the mysqli class, in order to switch to mysql.p  pWe can create functions with the same names as in mysqli e.g. query, storeresult and return similar parameters so that we only have to change the object initiation in codeTeraWurflDatabaseMySQL5.phpcode file.p  pHas anybody done thisp
Negative 391 pInternet Explorer is giving me a serious headache...p  pWhat I want to do is  create a button upon clicking which an .csv file is getting downloaded to a client. This .csv file includes information stored in one of the result tables I am producing on the page.p  pBefore I create this button I am calling an internal function to create the .csv file based on the currently displayed table. I create this .csv file on the server. Ill inlcude this function here just in case, but I dont think it is of any help. Like I said I create this file, before I am creating the button.p  precode  Creates a .csv file including all the data stored in records    tableheaders   array storing the table headers corresponding to records    records         two dimensional array storing the records that will be written into the .csv file    filename        string storing the name of the .csv file created by this from  public function exporttablecsv tableheaders, records, filename               Open the filename and store the handle to it in csvfile     csvfile  fopen temp . filename, w        Write the tableheaders into csvfile as a first row     fputcsv csvfile, tableheaders              Iterate through records and write each record as one line separated with commas to csvfile     foreach  records as row          fputcsv csvfile, row        Close csvfile      fclose csvfile    end exporttablecsv codepre  pI have that working fine. I got the Export button and I am using its onClick event where I am using a onelinerp  precodewindow.open temp . exportfilename  codepre  pNow, it works as intended in all browsers, except IE. The file still gets downloaded, but then when I perform some filtering on the table I am displaying on the page the page gets reloaded whenever new filters are applied, and then press the Export button again, it somehow downloads an old version of the .csv file with the old filters applied, not the current ones, even though this .csv file is rewritten every time the new filters are being applied and the page gets reloaded. p  pIt is as if the .csv file I am exporting is stored in IEs cache or something... It is really annoying as the export works fine in all other browsers... Chrome and FF always download the latest version of the file from the server, IE updates the file randomly, sometimes only after I submit the page with different filters a few times...p  pI didnt include too many lines of my code as I rather think I am simply missing some kind of meta tag or something from my code, rather than have a logical bug in the lines I have already written.p  pI am really confused by this and annoyed to say the least... I really start to dislike IE now...p  pI appreciate any suggestions on this matter.p

Then I will strongrebuildstrong the strong.apkstrong file.p  pThe thing is I cant change anything with jdgui.p  pIf I try to compile a single .java file with javac, it will give me import errors there are a lot of imports in the file.p  pI have tried a hrefhttpwww.varaneckas.comjad relnofollowusing jada to decompile the class file, and this is what Im working with.p  pAlthough it gave a lot of cannot fully decompile errors.p  pWhat I think I want to do is just copy amp paste the entire java file content from jdgui into notepad, save it as .java, then compile it into .class, and reinsert it into the .jar file.p  pBut its easier said than done. I dont know how to compile this new .java file into a .class file, because of all the imports. eg. where do I get import android.content.intent etc and do i really need to keep the directory structures and so onp  pIs there an easier way I am just trying to change a single line. All the rest can be kept the same.p

Negative 391 pIm using codeRfc2898DeriveBytescode to securely generate encryption key and initialization vector from usersupplied string password, to use with symmetric encryption e.g. AesManaged.p  pIm taking the SHA1 hash of password as a salt parameter to codeRfc2898DeriveBytescode. Is that ok If not, then where should I get the salt from I will need the same salt when decrypting, right So I have to store it somewhere unencrypted  unsecured.

How do I properly use codeRfc2898DeriveBytescode to derive secure encryption key and IVp  pThanks.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pThanks for your answers. I now understand that the main maybe only purpose of salt is to make generation of rainbow tables impossible  you cant pregenerate the hash of Pw0rd because it will have a different hash for each possible salt value. I understand this perfectly, BUT... Is this really relevant to symmetric encryption Im not storing the hash anywhere right So even if the attacker has the rainbow table for all possible password combinations, he cant do much, rightp  pSo, my question now is Is there any advantage of using the random salt in each encryption operation, compared to using passwordderived or even hardcoded salt, strongwhen used with symmetric encryption algorithmsstrong like AesManaged of .NETp
Negative 391 pI am in an early stage of new project design and I contemplating with which datastores to use. br The project is a web platform which can be described as a large social online books library, book composed from pieces which will be edited by the users, each piece can be text,audio,video...brp  pAs you already figuring there are many relationships which should be considered,concepts like follows,likes,tags,categories and customization algorithms based on these,correct me if I wrong that kind of data is called semistructured data, The structured for the relationships between the entities  Profiles , Pieces , Books .. and the unstructured will be referring to the pieces content.brp  pI had a great experience lately on other project with NoSQL strongMongoDBstrong so I am trying to stick with NoSQL datastore solution if possible, The thing is I dont think mongo is built for that kind of data modeling because of all these relationships. brp  pAfter few hours of research storing these relationships in stronggraph based DBstrong like strongNeo4Jstrong  sounds like great thing to do, but regarding the unstructured data..

The problem is in line with codep  Pool10code, and only in one file processed so far. brbr The input is a txt file. Thats the essential part of the code. My problem is, that the input file gives 10 vars with getvars function. When the iteration starts, the first 6 cycles are processed properly, but at the seventh one, the script freezes. It drains 100 of one core and sits like that for 23 minutes then dies without any error report. I put markers to find faulty line and got to the fact, that in iteration 7., Marker1 is displayed, but Marker2 is not. The end display looks like thisp  precodeIteration 1 Marker1 Marker2 Iteration 2 Marker1 Marker2 Iteration 3 Marker1 Marker2 Iteration 4 Marker1 Marker2 Iteration 5 Marker1 Marker2 Iteration 6 Marker1 Marker2 Iteration 7 Marker1 codepre  pIt seems, that the process stops at assigning workers with Pool method, but i have no idea why. What is even more interesting, using other files does not result in this kind of situation. Im using Python 2.7.3 on Ubuntu 11.10p
Negative 391 pI am trying to use Burn and WIX 3.6 to make an installer for my app. The installer must be capable of installing .NET 3.5 SP1 from Microsofts web site. I am working from a working WIX project created with WIX 3.5. It works, if .NET 3.5 SP1 has been previously installed on the target machine. The first step appears to be to create a bundle, so I added a  element to my Product.wxs file. When I do that I get an error saying that the  is not valid in the schema, I must have a  instead. Does that mean that I have to transfer all the product definitions into a fragment Its unclear how I do that. Then the thing gets more complicated, since WixNetfxExtension only provides PackageRef for .NET 4.0 and 4.5. I am not ready to switch my app to that version of the framework. SO how do I get .NET 3.5 SP1 from a web source in my bundlep  pIs there a working example of doing this anywherep

Negative 391 pI have created an application and it runs fine on devices above a certain api level, however when I run it on a phone with an API level of 7 it doesnt work correctly. It doesnt crash though. If I change the min or target api value in the manifest the application still runs and I get no errorswarnings in eclipse. So my question is how am I supposed to tell what API level to use without installing every single android API, creating an emulator and seeing if it runs correctly. the erro happens when I use the following code  when I use the following codep  precode  cal  Calendar.getInstance              cal.setyear, month, day, hour,minute             current time               intent  new Intentthis, AlarmReceiver.class              intent.putExtravns, 1                sender  PendingIntent.getBroadcastthis, 192837, intent,              PendingIntent.FLAGUPDATECURRENT              Get the AlarmManager service              am  AlarmManager getSystemServiceALARMSERVICE              am.setAlarmManager.RTCWAKEUP, cal.getTimeInMillis, sender  codepre  pit does not correctly set an event instead it does nothingp

Negative 391 pOn my project, I currently use AspectJ not just Spring AOP due to some limitation with the weaving at the Compile Time. In order to speed up the development on Eclipse, I want to do the weaving at the Load Time. I succeed to do that but with one major constraint using an interface for my service that contained some transactional methods. strongIf I declare the service with its implementation instead of its interface, in the caller class, there is no weaving and so no transaction supported.strongp  pSo strongif it is supported by AspectJ, how to configure AspectJ with Load Time Weaving without Interface strongp  pI created a little project that reproduce the issuep  pThe following test fail.p  pThe following test succeed if p  ul lipthe injected service is declared with its interface instead of its implementation i.e. replace Inject MyServiceImpl service by Inject MyService service, the test succeed.pli lipthe weaving is executed during the compilation the configuration, POM amp Spring application context, is obviously different in this case. But my goal is to do the weaving at the LoadTime to avoid a weaving phase every time I save a Java file.pli lipSpring AOP txannotationdriven modeproxy, that is a proxybased solution, is used instead of AspectJ. But in this case, we encountered the selfinvocation issue, i.e. a method within the target object calling some other method of the target object, wont lead to an actual transaction at runtime even if the invoked method is marked with Transactional.pli ul  paspectjltwsrctestjavamycompanyaspectjltwMyServiceImplTest.javap  precodepackage mycompany.aspectjltw  import static

Negative 391 pIm having these troubles since almost 2 full days now and see this as my last chance to get a neat solution of my 2pageeditor before giving up.p  pPlease use strongFirefoxstrong first and have a look at a hrefhttptwopageeditor.bastianschulz.com relnofollowhttptwopageeditor.bastianschulz.comap  pSTEPSp  ol liset the caret into the last row Exiles, similes, and revilesli lipress the down arrow keyli ol  pRESULT the caret is in the first row on page 2p  pShort explaination about the implementation  The editor contains two separate contenteditable DIV elements.   In case of leaving a page by moving with the cursor within an contenteditable DIV element, we just swap the places and positions of the DIV elements but the caret stays in the same DIV element. The page 2 which is on the left side, is still the same DIV element that was on the right side when we were still on page 1.  When changes to the text are done, the unselected DIV element is blurred out because it might be outofdate. When the selected DIV element is deselected again, its content is fully copied into the other DIV element so that all changes that have been done are kept and therefore synchronized with the other DIV element.p  pNow use strongChromestrong or strongSafaristrong IE not at all, that will be my next issue... STEPSp  ol liset the caret into the last row Exiles, similes, and revilesli lipress the down arrow keyli ol  pRESULT the caret is in the first row 1 on page 2p  pBUT this row is not visible. Press down arrow key again and it appears in the second row of page 2. When you press the arrow up key now, the content moves again, the caret is in row 1 and page 2 is displayed as it should and like Firefox does it correctly.p  pREASON right after you pressed the down arrow key on the first page you will see for a part of a second that content in this DIV is automatically scrolled by the browser so that the position of the caret is still visible. This causes a displacement of the DIV element by 20px of its CSS top attribute. When setting thereafter the new absolute value of top520px e.g. the height of the page  viewport is 520px this weird shifting of 20px is still there. p  pI havent figured out a way how to stop this automatic scrolling of the content when its not visible anymore. Or at least to be able to kind of reset the contenteditable DIV back to its normal state.p  pAnyone ideasp  pCheersp

Negative 391 pI have a python application that in parallel spawns subprocesses bash scripts mostly. Some of the scripts may call other scripts. Im trying to work out the best way to handle termination edge cases for the application, and the subprocesses.p  pIf the application needs to quit, or receives a codeSIGTERMcode, then it should terminate codeSIGTERMcode, codewaitcode, codeSIGKILLcode all subprocesses and any processes they created. An approach for this would be to start as a new process group and kill the process group as part of the termination codekillpgcode.p  pIf any of the subprocesses takes longer than a specified time, I would like to kill them and and child processes they created. An approach here is to set application as a process group leader so that I may just killpg the group and rely on that to kill any other subprocesses.p  pThe hard bit is that these two solutions conflict with each other, and so I seem to only be able to satisfy one requirement.p  pSo, a final thought is to use tcsetpgrp, but Im not overly familiar with it. So, something like simulate an interactive terminal. This would mean that killing the application sends a codeSIGHUPcode i think to all processes, and I can use process groups to manage killing subprocesses that take too long.p  pIs this a good idea, or are there any other suggestions Im missingp  pBonus section If the application is killed via codeSIGKILLcode it is needed occassionally in this application, yes i know codeSIGKILLcode should be avoided, etc..., it would be amazing to have the subprocesses killed as well in the same way that bash sends a codeSIGHUPcode to its processes when it exits.p

Each version claims to be faster, at a minor precission cost.p  pTo my knowledge, theres no compiled material e.g. a book explaining what can be done, including the basics not anyone knows assembly, SSE, SIMD, MMX, FPU, etc..

Negative 391 pin the JSF2 application Im working on, I need to start a server side Timer when a user does an action.br This timer must be related to the application itself, so it must survive when the user session is closed.br To solve this problem, I thought to use java.util.Timer class instantiating the timer object in an Application scoped bean.br Could it be a good solution Are there other better ways to achive this Thanks p
Negative 391 pI understand the codegtgtgtcode fixes the overflow when adding two big positive longs you may endup with a negative number. Can someone explain how this bitwise shift magically fixes the overflow problem And how it is different than codegtgtcode p  hr  pMy suspicious I think it has to do with the fact that Java uses twocompliments so the overflow is the right number if we had the extra space but because we dont it becomes negative. So when you shift and paddle with zero it magically gets fixed due to the twocompliments. But I can be wrong and someone with a bitwise brain has to confirm. p

Negative 391 pIm trying to rewrite some code I wrote time ago with a functional language OCaml into C.p  pMy problem can be  shortened intop  ul liI have a stack of valuesli lia value can be of a variant type so a set of different kinds of values, eg codeintcode, codefloatcode, codestdstringcode, codestdlistcode whateverli liI want to define operators which work on the values eg an addition operation which pops two values and pushes the sum of themli lisome operators behaves differently according to the types which are found on the stack, ideally some operators even change the number of arguments according to the type a simple example addition operator could pop one value, if its a codestdlistcode then push the operator applied between all values of the list, otherwise pops another value and do the addition if theyre both floatli ul  pUp to now Ive been able to make it work by using templates eg. p  precodeclass Value    public     ValueType type  typetype        virtual string svalue const  0     virtual string lvalue      virtual bool equalsValue value const  0     virtual Value clone const  0      const Type type      virtual Value     template ltclass Tgt class TValue  public Value    protected     T value    public     TValueType type, T value  Valuetype, valuevalue       void setT value  thisgtvalue  value      T get const  return thisgtvalue    class Int  public TValueltintgt    private    public       Intint value  TValueltintgtTYPEINT, value        virtual string svalue const      virtual bool equalsValue value const  return thisgtvalue  TValueltintgtvaluegtget      virtual Value clone const  return new Intvalue   codepre  pand then operators are interpreted by doingp  precodeValue v1, v2, case OPPLUS    if vmgtpopTwoampv1, ampv2          switch v1gttype ltlt 4  v2gttype            case TYPESTYPEINT, TYPEINT vmgtpushnew IntIntv1gtget  Intv2gtget break       case TYPESTYPEFLOAT, TYPEINT vmgtpushnew FloatFloatv1gtget  Intv2gtget break       case TYPESTYPEINT, TYPEFLOAT vmgtpushnew FloatIntv1gtget  Floatv2gtget break       case TYPESTYPEFLOAT, TYPEFLOAT vmgtpushnew FloatFloatv1gtget  Floatv2gtget break           break  codepre  pNow, this works but I dont like the approach because it sounds quite clumsy, it requires a lot of type casts and it is not elegant at all compared to my functional implementation. Im starting to looking into emboostem library to see if I can find a better way to manage everything, before starting with it I was trying to define a different way of defining operators such asp  precodetemplate ltOpcode T, class X, class Agt class Unary  public   static A ptrX x        cout ltlt Missing instruction ltlt endl     return NULL       template ltgt class UnaryltOPMINUS, Float, Floatgt    public     static Float ptrFloat x  return new Floatxgtget    codepre  pSo that Im able to dop  precodeFloat a  new Float10 Float r  UnaryltOPMINUS, Float, Floatgtptrf codepre  pThis works but Im still unable to see how I am supposed to manage it in a generic way so that I can call the right function according to what is found on the stack and which operators is used.p  pWill boost help me somehow What I would like to have is a solution that is type safe and elegant at the same time but boost has so many different libraries that is hard for me to just understand what to look for. I dont need to use it if there is something easier that I am missing, I didnt think to find so many difficulties when dropping a functional language for this kind of task.p

Negative 391 pIm trying to use AngularUI directive calendar and set its source in callback function in my own directive so basically I wrap directive into directive. p  pSo use of my directive in html isp  precodeltcalendargtltcalendargt codepre  pI have this template form my wrapping directive calendar.htmlp  precodeltdiv classrowfluid gt  ltdiv datauicalendarheight 450,editable false classspan8 calendar datangmodeleventsgtltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pAnd declared this directivep  precode.directivecalendar, [calendarFct, functioncalendarFct      return          restrict E,         templateUrl partialsdirectivescalendar.html,         link functionscope, element, attrs               var mainScope  scope               load data from server              calendarFct.getEventsfunctiondata                   mainScope.events  data  DOESNT WORK                              mainScope.events  data  this would work, but I dont have data here                 codepre  pSo the problem is Im trying to set scope.events in the callback function but it doesnt show anything in browser but the code in callback function is executed. If I try it outside the callback, it would work but I have to load data from server first... How to make it work I would think that the trick with codemainScopecode would work or even directly codescope.eventscode but nope. Thanksp  pstrongIt looks like some issue with AngularUIs fullcalendar. I tried to change the directive template to simple input box and changed value binded with ngmodel in the callback function and it worked finestrongp
Negative 391 pI hope that I did my homework on this one, Im basically asking for a second opinion.p  pMy understanding is that the CCR and the DSS and the rest of the MS RDS tools cannot and will not run on a device that supports the .NET Micro Framework.p  pMy goal is to, as much as possible, use the DSS to talk to devices but some of the devices that I would like to talk to such as Camera modules will be connected to a Panda II Micro Framework board. Therefore, unless I write a DSSCompatible service on the Panda II board that publishes the camera, I will not be able to access the Cameras feed through most other means.p  pFrankly I find that the .NET MF does 50 of the solution great and MS RDS does the other 50 great  I just wish that I could have the DSS running on the .NET MF.p  pAm I mostly correct in my research Have I missed somethingp  pMy project involves creating a home automation system and I find the MS RDS compatible devices either difficult to find especially for some purposes or very expensive. While .NET Micro Framework compatible devices will give me a humidity sensor for around 20 and other great capabilities for just as low a price. And I dont have the knowhow to create a hardware solution, I just have ideas and Id like to make a prototype.p
Negative 391 pWe have a group of developers moving from C to C and WinRT. We used DOxygen as part of our C developer builds, and Id like to continue to have document generation as part of the developer build in CWinRT.p  pIts easy to turn on XML Doc generation, and I believe that will provide warnings for malformed tags, but without actual HTML output, I think our developers will be missing valuable feedback.p  pLooks like NDoc is now defunct, and I took a quick look at Sandcastle, but found it rather complex. Ideally, Im looking for something that doesnt unduly burden developers, or require them to remember extra steps as they edit, build, test, and commit. In other words, the best solution would be something that just happens, like a postbuild step, and doesnt add significantly to each developers build time.p  pIf anyone has had some experience doing this in CWinRT, Id sure like some advice.p  pThanks in advancep
Negative 391 pI had a sudden doubt yesterday. I have been programming in C for a long time. My question is thisp  pSuppose there is a variable p  precodestatic uint32t count  0 codepre  pThis variable should be stored in the data segment.For the sake of this example let us assume that data segment starts at offset code0x08000000code in the 4GB virtual memory space of the process.p  pI know that somewhere after the offset code0x08000000code there is 4 byte reserved for the variable count with the value 0.p  pMy question is how is this 4byte value in memory associated with the name count and the type uint32t or the fact that it is 4bytes long and not 6 bytes long for example.p  pFrom the answers below it seems that the mapping information is stored in the codesymbol tablecodep  pIt seems to suggest that it has to be a part of the final executable in memory.If so where is the symbol table stored is it in the codetext segmentp

Negative 391 pI have an app, listening for the .log file in chosen folder. I used there codeFileSystemWatchercode.p  pBut there is a problem. Other app responsible for making that file makes fallowing stepsp  ol liMake a .gz fileli liUnpack it to txt file some random file nameli liChange the .txt name to proper one with .log extention. li ol  pAnd I can not do anything with this behaviour. p  pSo I made 2 codeFileSystemWatchercodes for .gz, and .txt files. Why Because this app sometimes doesnt unpack gz file, and sometimes doesnt rename txt file to the final .log file. p  pcodeFileSystemWatcher2code catches txt file, then in the most cases it is renamed to the log in next 1000ms i need to wait some time to check if txt file exists if not it, it seems to be renamed to the final .log file. p  pQuestion is, how to check if file exists without codeThread.Sleepcode to prevent UI freeze  p  pI hope it is clear, if not i will try to describe it better.

Negative 391 pIm writing a serverclient architecture based game in Java.p  pFor design reasons, I would like to use asynchronous calls for passing client actions to the server, and also asynchronous callbacks for passing the results of said actions back to the client. Asynchronous calls allow buffering of client actions. Queued buffering allows simple, basically one threaded processing of client actions.p  pAt the moment, my server and client code is pretty symmetric. They create a registry, then export and bind themselves.p  pAsynchronicity is achieved by buffering the incoming actions or results in a ConcurrentLinkedQueue. Actual processing is done by a thread running at regular intervals.p  pHowever, this current architecture does not work when clients are firewalled or behind a NAT. In this case the server simply can not reach clients to push results to them.p  pFurthermore, in this current architecture the server does not know which client sent a given action, unless a redundant layer of authentication or session handling is introduced. This allows forged actions and cheating.p  hr  pIve been thinking about possible solutions but havent found a proper onep  ul lipClient pull instead of server push. There could be a method on the server that the clients call periodically to fetch their results. However, this approach seems very ugly, it introduces additional delays, bandwidth and timing issues. Does not solve action forgery either. Direct notifications are also very much preferred.pli lipTCP connections by themselves allow bidirectional communication, and can definitely identify clients, so RMI or JRemoting emmightem be hacked to support it, but Im dont know how, and Im not aware of any existing solution.pli lipMessage passing.

So each data item lets say it is a name and corresponding phone number should be same in the database and in the flat file. E.g. if one of the rows in database says for john the number is 220 343 123 then the row in the flat file for john must have number as 220 343 123. If not, I report a break and move on. p  pOf course I could pick up each row from database and try to match it to some row in the file horrible persformance.  Or I could, sort the table and the file somehow before I do that still clunky  Or ... something else p  pThe question to the forum is, do you know of any library  tool in java world that could be leveraged for this p  pThanks.p

Negative 391 pWe are building an application that consists of a web app and a strongnativestrong iOS client.  The web app is pretty straight forward with Meteor.  But on the Native iOS App was wondering if someone can give us some pointers on the best practices for that app to call into meteor.

Negative 391 pWe have a few 100s of SSIS packages in our environment.  Last night we moved our database from one server to another and renamed it.  We now need to go into all of packages and change the connection manager to point to the new database server name.p  pWe want to know if there is a way to create a variablename that we can store our new server name in it i.e. ELITEDB.SIRSdb in it so we can then put the variablename into the Connection Manager area.  This way if we move servers again in another year we only need to make this change once because the new variablename will be able to pull the new Server name.DBname.p  pI hope this makes sense to the masses out therep

Negative 391 pThe game Im designing uses multiple nested CCSprites, so that when the parent sprite moves, rotates, scales, etc. the child sprite does as well, automatically, and so do its grandchildren.p  pIt works great but bogs down very quickly since I havent implemented batch nodes, currently its making over 4000 draw calls at once which is obviously not optimal.p  pHowever as far as I know the only way to use batch nodes is to make all the sprites a child of the batch node.  I thought maybe I could add each parent to the batch node and then add the rest as children of that one but that doesnt work.p  pAny ideas  Id like to avoid having to manually calculate the position, rotation, scale, etc of each child sprite every time its parent moves, which at the moment seems to be the only way I can think of to make this work.p

Negative 391 pMine is a legacy code and somewhere long time back memory leak was introduced. I am using p  pcodeCrtSetDbgFlag  CRTDBGALLOCMEMDF  CRTDBGLEAKCHECKDF codep  pwhich implicitly calls codeCrtDumpMemoryLeakscode upon terminationexit from anywhere in code. I am aware of the fact that if we call codeCrtDumpMemoryLeakscode explicitly and some global object is there then memory leak will be reported. That is why not calling codeCrtDumpMemoryLeakscode directly.p  pGet memory leaks and since I am using new throughout thecode exact line number and file name are not coming inspite of declaring define CRTDBGMAPALLOC. I have 3 optionsp  precode1. Use VLD but it does not report any leaks. 2. Override new operator so that CRT works. But get error that new is redefined. actually since it is a huge code base, some other place has overriden it conflicts are arising 3. Use number in curly braces and use crtbreakalloc , but that number is not stable across runs. thus cannot use this strategy as well. codepre  pPlease help me resolve this issue. Any better mem leak detecting tools I used Valgrind on Linux as well. It also doesnot report any mem leak. Only CRT debug reports.p

Negative 391 pThere is a performance issue I am trying to debug as part of a more complicated code. It seems that codeappendcode function that I am using to create a dynamic, growable vector of codeInt,Int,Int,Intcode is causing one of the codeIntcode in the tuple to be boxed and unboxed before being written to the vector.

Negative 391 pI have a little problem with Firefox and forms.p  pI have a form that is dynamically loaded from an external file from the same server trough an XMLHttpRequest that has no set target and no direct submit button but sends its data trough a Javascript function, looks like thisp  precodeltform nameblahformgt     ltinput typetext nameblubbgt     ltinput typebutton valueBarfoo onclickreturn someFunctionthis.formgt     ltinput typehidden nameidgt ltformgt codepre  pThe problem is that Firefox sends this to the forms page, completely ignoring my Javascript code of course. It works if i dont press enter but use the button directly, but i want him to ignore the enter key completely or at least only call the Javascript routine and not try to send the whole thing into nirvana, reloading the page. And yes, there is a XMLHttpRequest waiting behind that Javascript function for that data.  p  pSo, how to tell Firefox to do what i want and not what he thinks is bestp  pBTW, i have started the form with submit instead of button and changed to button in the hope that this solves the issue, but no luck with that.p  pEDIT Solution, thanks to Mike and Riateche Used an onsubmitreturn false inside the lt form tag and it works like expected now.p

When viewing the zoo, the user can edit a tapir and replace it with another.  To do this a popup window is shown with a select form populated by tapir names and a span showing the currently selected GoofinessLevel.  p  pSo, when the select element changes this changes the TapirId in currentTapir.

Negative 391 pMy app is a map view where the user can enter an address which will put a purple pin on the map for the HQ. Secondly, the user can enter any address, which will put a red pin on the map. I would like to be able to change the pin color of the red pins to either red, green, or purple.p  pI stumbled across a tutorial that will allow the user to select an annotation pin and change its pin color by displaying a modal view. I followed the tutorial meticulously, but for some reason, it is not working correctly. The modal view with the pin selection is displayed, but when a pin color is selected, the pin color on the map view is not updated. Additionally, instead of using png images to display custom pins, I would like to use the builtin standard pins since thats all I need. How can I adjust my code below to achieve this I added my entire code.p  pFieldMapController.mp  precodeimport FieldMapController.h import CustomAnnotation.h define HQlatitude headquarterslatitude

Negative 391 pI cannot get tkinter to update a pair of simple application global boolean variables to match that of the associated checkbox.  The booleans are initialized, updated and stored in one file and are referenced readonly by another file.  Regardless of the checkbox state the booleans never change from their default value.  A side point of note The initial values of FalseTrue get changed into 01, presumably due to the problematic way tkinter impelements booleans. Curiously, there are NO problems with the similar application global TABLE of booleans that corresponds to a table of tkinter checkboxes.  The table is an instance of a class defined by a third file. The table resides in the same file and is treated in the same way as the simple booleans.br All boolean values are used readonly in one file File1.py and are only modified by the other file File2.py.  Explicitly returning the problem booleans from File2.py to File1.py did not work.p  pThe environment being used is Windows 7, Python 3.2.2 on Eclipse Juno 4.2.2, build M201302041200 with the Pydev 2.7.32013031601 plugin.  The application is being run from the Eclipse console.p  pBy the LEGB scoping rules everything seems OK the include and global statements are present and the dotted name form is being used for the externally defined application level global variables. As I see it, either all boolean updates should work or none should work.  So why does the boolean table work properly but not the simple booleans  and what is needed to get the simple booleans to work properlybr Speculating, could it have something to do with the way python implements variables that have basic values e.g. 0, 1, 2, 3, True False as shared values instead of separate variables  and this leads to problems when referencing these simple values from other modules  p  pThe sample application consists of 3 files each has been reduced as far as possible while remaining able to show the problem.

Negative 391 pIve been developing using GWT 2.3.0 and GXT 2.2.5. I was finally able to move up to GWT 2.4.0 and decided to look into what it would take to migrate to GXT 3.0, but right off the bat I hit a snag.p  pThe application does a lot of blocking the user by masking the browser. I use the following commands to do sop  precodeXDOM.getBodyEl.mask XDOM.getBodyEl.unmask codepre  pFirst thing I noticed was that in 3.0, XDOM no longer has the getBodyEl method, so I have no way of retrieving the top document widget from anywhere in the application. I do see there is now a Mask class, but since it requires an element parameter to work, Im still in need of a reasonably easy way to get the document body element.p  pIve tried searching through the Sencha forums with no success. Any suggestions as to how I could do thisp

Negative 391 pIt seems like passwords are always getting compromised. I want to write a program, preferably in CC or Python, that I can use to fill in my passwords on the various sites I visit but do so from a program I manage on my machine that stores my pws and logins locally. p  pThe reason a program is the best idea would be so that I can make very strong passwords and change them often. I would be able to choose my own encryption for the local storagedatabase. I would also be able to manage a schedule to keep passwords young.p  pI am asking the question because I havent had much luck looking for a starting point. For instance, can I use Python to ask my browser for a list textboxes on a page I have open in a browser Can I fill in the text boxes and click buttons from code that runs independent of the browserp  pIt didnt look like Google Python API was right, and I dont know that JS would act like a console app. Maybe Selenium and Pythonp  pA good answer for me would be languages and platforms that would meet these requirements. Im open to learning a new language or using a different browser, but I have no idea where to start.p  pThanks in advancep
Negative 391 pIm trying to to get my logo image to fadeout when the onLogoComplete timer stops and calls the onCompleteNukerLogo timer to run the Starling animation fadeTo on the logo image.

The logo fades in, pauses for a second for viewers to see it, and then the killtimers removal timers are called and when the last timer runs its supposed to fade the logo out and then it removes the child.

Is there any way to achieve this using only CSS3 [Without using Javascript] If not, can you please suggest best option to achieve same [Note  Im not using any javascript on the page, so adding anything like jQuery will add overheads on page load time]p  precodelthtmlgtltheadgt     ltstylegt .vKeyboardSplKeys      backgroundcolorDEDBE4      border1px solid 666666     displayinlineblock     color000000     fontfamilyarial       fontweightbold     padding3px 6px     margin  2px     cursorpointer  .vKeyboardSplKeysHover      backgroundcolor8cb82b .vKeyboardSplKeysactive      positionrelative     top1px   .vKeyboardKeys      width9px     backgroundcolorEEEEEE     border1px solid 666666     displayinlineblock     color000000     fontfamilyarial       fontweightbold     padding3px 8px     margin  2px     cursorpointer .vKeyboardKeysHover      backgroundcolorCEE9FC .vKeyboardKeysactive      positionrelative     top1px   .space      padding  3px 40px   vKeyboard     border  1px solid DDDDDDD     backgroundcolor  F4F4F4     padding5px     textaligncenter  ltstylegt ltheadgt ltbodygt     ltcentergtltinput typetext idanswer valuegt     ltdiv idvKeyboard stylewidth 100pxgtltspan classvKeyboardSplKeys vKeyboardSplKeysHover stylebordertopleftradius 6px bordertoprightradius 6px borderbottomleftradius 6px borderbottomrightradius 6pxgtBackspaceltspangtltbrgtltspan classvKeyboardKeys stylebordertopleftradius 6px bordertoprightradius 6px borderbottomleftradius 6px borderbottomrightradius 6pxgt7ltspangtltspan classvKeyboardKeys stylebordertopleftradius 6px bordertoprightradius 6px borderbottomleftradius 6px borderbottomrightradius 6pxgt8ltspangtltspan classvKeyboardKeys stylebordertopleftradius 6px bordertoprightradius 6px borderbottomleftradius 6px borderbottomrightradius 6pxgt9ltspangtltbrgtltspan classvKeyboardKeys stylebordertopleftradius 6px bordertoprightradius 6px borderbottomleftradius 6px borderbottomrightradius 6pxgt4ltspangtltspan classvKeyboardKeys stylebordertopleftradius 6px bordertoprightradius 6px borderbottomleftradius 6px borderbottomrightradius 6pxgt5ltspangtltspan classvKeyboardKeys stylebordertopleftradius 6px bordertoprightradius 6px borderbottomleftradius 6px borderbottomrightradius 6pxgt6ltspangtltbrgtltspan classvKeyboardKeys stylebordertopleftradius 6px bordertoprightradius 6px borderbottomleftradius 6px borderbottomrightradius 6pxgt1ltspangtltspan classvKeyboardKeys stylebordertopleftradius 6px bordertoprightradius 6px borderbottomleftradius 6px borderbottomrightradius 6pxgt2ltspangtltspan classvKeyboardKeys stylebordertopleftradius 6px bordertoprightradius 6px borderbottomleftradius 6px borderbottomrightradius 6pxgt3ltspangtltbrgtltspan classvKeyboardKeys stylebordertopleftradius 6px bordertoprightradius 6px borderbottomleftradius 6px borderbottomrightradius 6pxgt0ltspangtltspan classvKeyboardKeys stylebordertopleftradius 6px bordertoprightradius 6px borderbottomleftradius 6px borderbottomrightradius 6pxgt.ltspangtltspan classvKeyboardKeys stylebordertopleftradius 6px bordertoprightradius 6px borderbottomleftradius 6px borderbottomrightradius 6pxgtltspangtltbrgtltspan classvKeyboardSplKeys dataleft stylebordertopleftradius 6px bordertoprightradius 6px borderbottomleftradius 6px borderbottomrightradius 6pxgtamplarrltspangtltspan classvKeyboardSplKeys dataright stylebordertopleftradius 6px bordertoprightradius 6px borderbottomleftradius 6px borderbottomrightradius 6pxgtamprarrltspangtltbrgtltspan classvKeyboardSplKeys stylebordertopleftradius 6px bordertoprightradius 6px borderbottomleftradius 6px borderbottomrightradius 6pxgtClear Allltspangtltbrgtltdivgtltcentergt ltbodygtlthtmlgt codepre

Negative 391 pThere are some good posts on here such as a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions821637createabuffermatrixforcontinuousmeasurementsthis onea on how to make a circular buffer in MATLAB. However from looking at them, I do not believe they fit my application, because what I am seeking, is a circular buffer solution in MATLAB, that does NOT involve any copying of old data. p  pTo use a simple example, let us say that I am processing 50 samples at a time, and I read in 10 samples each iteration. I would first run through 5 iterations, fill up my buffer, and in the end, process my 50 samples. So my buffer will be p  precode[B1 B2 B3 B4 B5] codepre  p, where each B is a block of 10 samples. p  pNow, I read in the next 10 samples, call them B6. I want my buffer to now look likep  precode[B2 B3 B4 B5 B6] codepre  pThe catch is this  I do NOT want to copy the old data, B2, B3, B4, B5 everytime, because it becomes expensive in time. I have very large data sets. p  pI am wondering if there is a way to do this without any copying of old data. Thank you.p

Negative 391 pToday I had one of those android moments again, which left me absolutely clueless.p  pI have an app which consists of a DrawerLayout, which includes a RelativeLayout as container for a SurfaceView surfaceViewContainer and a second ViewGroup subclass of RelativeLayout as navigation.p  pWhen the app starts, in onCreate I inflate the layout and add a SurfaceView to the surfaceViewContainer.p  pOn a Samsung S2 with 4.1.2 and a S3 with 4.3 everything works fine, I can see the SurfaceView  drawn and I can open and close the drawer, by swipe gesture or home button. Then I tested on Android 4.4 with a Nexus 5 and a Nexus 10, on both devices the drawer will not appear. Even pushing the home button wont do a thing.p  pEven stranger  I can open the Drawer before adding the SurfaceView, when I do so I can interact with the Drawer even after adding the SurfaceView, even on Android 4.4, so openclose works then.p  pSo my question  Anybody experienced something like this before or has some advice or knows what might have changed from Android 4.3 to 4.4 p  pps I used DrawerLayout successfully in other apps already, just not with SurfaceView, so I assume the problem lies there.p  pThanksp

Negative 391 pThe problem I am facing lies in the fact a binding utilizing codeRelativeSourcecode does not update its target when element the bindings applied to changes its position in the visual tree.p  pSo, if one has the following fragment of codep  precodeltBorder TagBorder1gt   ltTextBlock TextBinding PathTag, RelativeSourceRelativeSource AncestorTypeBorder gt ltBordergt  ltBorder TagBorder2 gt codepre  pThen an attempt to remove the codeTextBlockcode from the first codeBordercode and adding it to the second will not result in the codeTextBlockcode changing its codeTextcode value.p  pThe easiest workaround I can think of is to recreate all bindings that use RelativeSource and are applied to the elements subtree simply calling to codeUpdateTargetcode does no good. Does anybody know how one can do so Calling to codeClearBindingcodecodeSetBindingcode is easy enough, but how to find all dependency properties that need to be recreated I cant find a way to reliably collect all dependency properties of an object including attached.p  pAnother theoretically possible approach is to subclass codeBindingBasecode and so it will track codeVisualcode elements in the path to the actual source. Though I am quite sure there be some internal sealed stuff preventing from accomplishing this.p  pAny thoughts and alternative solutions are welcome.p

Negative 391 pIve been badly bitten by this strange behavior of lambdas under XCode today  after trying to trace several memory leaks in iOS around the code, Ive narrowed it down to this and similar snippets where I assign the ownership of something to a deferred task using a shared pointerp  precodevoid DBStoragedisposestdsharedptrltDataChunkgtamp dc      backgroundQueue.queueTask[]          assert dc.usecount  1           if dcgtisDirty              store to disk                codepre  pNote that the shared pointers use count is always 1 when the lambda is runp  pAfter execution, this task is nullified with codependingJob  nullptrcode which I expected to call the destructor of all the capturedbyvalue objects, and consequently codeDataChunkcodes destructor.

Negative 391 pWhen exporting a multipage report from SQL Server 2008 Reporting Services to Excel, by default, pages in the report created by a page break are sent to separate worksheets in the Excel file.p  pWhile this is fine most of the time  sometimes its not. Right now, Id like to be able to prevent those page breaks from causing additional worksheets to be created  I really would like to export all my pages into a single Excel worksheet and basically just ignore the page breaks or replace them with codecode or something like that.p  pSo when exporting my list of locations for a customer to strongPDFstrong, I would like to put each location on a separate page the location details are rendered out as a subreport, inside a grouping on the main report. But if I export to Excel, Id like to keep all data together in one worksheet.p  pI did find that the stronggroupingstrong on the main report contains a Page Breaks Between setting  but I cant seem to find a way to dynamically e.g. by means of a parameter change that so that I could turn it on for PDF rendering, and OFF for Excel exports.p  pHow can I do that  if at all Any ideas I cant seem to find any properties to set or hooks to hook into to influence the Export export from SSRS ...p

Negative 391 pI have two datasets consisting of lists of nested lists such that each item in the list looks like codelist1[i] [a, x, y b]code and codelist2[j]  [c, x, y, d]code and where the length of the two lists does not necessarily match.

Negative 391 pI am using SXSSF to write 1 Millionworst case scenario records.p  pFollowing is the way i have coded it. I have to write the records to an already existing excel template.

Negative 391 pI have a ASP.NET WebApp that contains some ASMX webservices. We recently migrated to load balanced Windows 2008 servers from a Windows 2003 server. The new servers sit behind some F5 appliance for the load balancing thats all I know about it. p  pWe can reach the built in ASP.NET POST test example a hrefhttpwebapp.company.comwebservicesPerson.asmxopGetPerson relnofollowhttpwebapp.company.comwebservicesPerson.asmxopGetPersona but invoking it from that test page fails page not available. A new tab in the browser opens with the same url, but with a port number appended on the end a hrefhttpwebapp.company.com50831webservicesPerson.asmxopGetPerson relnofollowhttpwebapp.company.com50831webservicesPerson.asmxopGetPersona. When I put that URLwith port into my browser, it fails as well. Heck, a hrefhttpwebapp.company.com50831 relnofollowhttpwebapp.company.com50831a isnt reachable at all.p  pWe didnt get that on our previous server. I setup my own personal webserver on a personal Windows 2012 server and tested the same code on there and it worked. So Im thinking it has to do with the load balancing.p  pUnfortunately, I have no control over the web servers our company offers for hosting internal applications. I dont get to touch the IIS either. All I get is a file path to publish my files to. The hosting organization is telling me my ASP.NET WebApp code is appending the port number, but I dont think thats right. It only occurs on those load balanced serversp  pHas anyone else ran into this before when invoking ASMX or WCF thats hosted behind a F5 appliancep

Negative 391 pIm trying to send a video stream obtained via WebRTCs getUserMedia method to the server for additional processing. Latency is important, as I wish to detect changes in the video stream and update the client immediately.

There are no errors, and the ondataavailable callback is called every 500ms, as expected. However, for three out of four of these calls, the size of the data provided is zero. This suggests to me that the data is being grouped into chunks of about two seconds possibly due to constraints of the video encoding being used.p  pIs it possible to get MediaRecorder to provide data at a finer granularity If not, what is the best way to get video data from the userMedia stream to the server with low latency An interface specific to Chrome or Firefox would be fine, but one that worked in both would be even better.p  precodelthtmlgt   ltbodygt     lth1gtMediaRecorder Testlth1gt     ltvideo idvideo width640 styleborder 1px solid blackgtltvideogt   ltbodygt lthtmlgt  ltscriptgt   The variable that holds the video stream  var mediastream  null    Start video capture and provide a way to stop it  navigator.mozGetUserMedia   video true, audio false ,    functionstreamarg       mediastream  streamarg      var vendorURL  window.URL  window.webkitURL      video.src  vendorURL.createObjectURLmediastream      video.play      recordStream    ,    functionerr  console.logError starting video stream   err       Record the stream  var recorder  null  function recordStream     recorder  new MediaRecordermediastream    recorder.ondataavailable  functionev       console.logGot ev.data.size        recorder.start500   ltscriptgt codepre

Negative 391 pSo Ive been trying to make a pretty accurate clone of the good old Pokemon Yellow for quite some time now and one puzzling but nonetheless subtle mechanic has puzzled me. As you can see in the uploaded image there is a certain colour manipulation done in two stages after entering a wrap to another game location such as stairs or entering a building. p  pOne easy and sloppy way of achieving this and the one I have been using so far is to make three pngs for each image sprite tilemaps, town images all of them with their colours adjusted accordingly to match each stage of the transition. Of course after a while this becomes tremendously time consuming.p  pSo my question is does anyone know any better way of achieving this colour manipulation effect using java and Graphics2D p  pThanks in advance,p  pAlexp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comhRRJL.png altWrap transitionp
Negative 391 pMy use case is as simple as it can get  I want to give multiple users the possibility to increment a counter by 1. Now with optimistic concurrency strategy it can happen that two user try to update the counter at the same time and an OptimisticLockException is thrown. If I understood correctly the OptimisticLockException is wrapped into a System Exception if I dont explicitly call EntityManagerflush. Now when this happens the transaction is rolled back. But how can I accomplish that the transaction is retried until it finally succeeds  Since I only want to increment the counter by 1 I dont have to deal with merging the two updates or so. I only want to be absolutely sure that no increment gets lost and I also dont want to go back to the user and ask him to perform his increment again.p

Negative 391 pIve been searching around to find a straight answer to a problem Im facing and the information is a little scattered. Im not sure whether its possible or not based on the answers.p  pBasically Im using codeiBeaconscode as a component to my app. The scenario is this, you have a high street with numerous shops. Each shop has 1 beacon in their window facing to the street. A generic shopping app is on the users phone.p  pWhen a user walks up the high street I want a user to receive a notification when passing a shop. This notification would say something like Check out codeMyShopscode latest offers and discounts with a prompt to open the app. This is all as the app is in the background.p  pAll the beacons have a emconsistent UDID which tie to my appem. And each shop would have its own major identifier.p  pI want the notification to be specific to a shop with a specific beacon major and minor but I cannot find a way of determining which beacon was entered while in the background.p  pAlso some shops may be close and have broadcast overlap, will the background process for entering a region trigger for each beacon you get in range of if they have the same emUDIDemp

I would rather avoid this as it seems like an unnecessary call to the datastore. So my question is how to I get the GoogleAccount createdBy updatedBy and owner propertiesp
Negative 391 pin a recent discussion on StackOverflow I was trying to resolve an imageicon issue that didnt display images after compilation, only when ran in eclipse. This problem was solved by changing the location of my resources folder from my project folder to the src folder. I was also taught to get my resources with the following codep  precodeImageIcon img  new ImageIcongetClass.getResourceresourcespicture.jpg codepre  pWithout looking at how I had coded my audio method, I asked if the method of putting resources inside the src folder was the same for all types of resources, in which I was told, pretty much. Anyway, now I have got to my audio code, I am a little unsure of how to implement the getClass.getResource line into it.p  pAs it stands my audio works as intended, when ran in eclipse, but when compiled it has the same issue as the images used too. I know that the problem is very similar, but I believe it is a matter of coding, or lack of it. Any pointers, or examples will be greatly appreciated.

Negative 391 pI want to create a set of ActiveRecord style classes that support codehasmanycode and codebelongstocode mixins but I dont need them to be tied to the database. The purpose of this is to aggregate data with a more strongly typed object then just using a collection of nested hashes.p  pLet me know if this doesnt make sense an I can edit my question with some sample code. Essentially the end goal is use the code.buildcode and codeoperatorltltcode methods to build some associated data.p

Negative 391 pI have two fragments in one activity and there is a ViewPager element in mainactivity.xml. I have created two different classes  that exteds Fragment class for each fragments and overrided onCreateView methods. The first fragment is a channels list. So its a listview that its each row consist of a textview and a button. I want when the user click the button, get passed the row  to listView in second fragment. I created a interface in ChannelsFragment named strongFavButtonClickedListenerstrong and overrided this interface in strongMainActivity.javastrong. Then I added emonAttachem method into ChannelsFragment in order to reference MainActivity. In getView method of Adapter of ChannelsFragment class I have set the clicklistener to imageButtons in each row and I called emwhenFavButtonClicked.onFavButtonClickedem My code is working for SharedPreferences hovewer I need to restart the application to see changes in favorites list.

Negative 391 pIm developing a new ios 8 application using SpriteKit. Recently I read a lot about adaptive UI but found no way to implement it with SpriteKit. Suppose for example that I programmatically create a subclass of SKNode, call it MyNode. In interface builder there is nothing that lets me put on the screen the node I just created. I found on raywenderlich a snippet of code that checkes whether the app is running in iPad or iPhone and resizes a playable area of 320x480 opportunely. Is there a method to adapt the ui with ib Or should I do this programmatically via that snippet Thanks.p  pThis is an example of what I mean. These are the app screens in iPad and iPhone.

Negative 391 pI would like to fill the space available in the GridView control with images. In specific, I would like to make 4 columns, each column with an Image. No space between columns.p  pFirst thought GridView fills the whole space available in the page, so I just need a converter that binds to the ActualWidth property of the GridView and than divide it by four columns. This should give me four columns with the same Width. The problem is that unfortunatly Width is not a simple number and dividing by 4 it gives probably a not perfect number, so the sum of the 4 columns Width can go over the grid and the result is that I can see only three columns instead of four. Even if I set the margin and the padding to zero, the result doesnt change.

Negative 391 pThis is based off my other question. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions28031936whatisanarraylinkedstructureornodearrayWhat is an array linked structure or node arrayap  pI was trying to do this exercise  img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comxWdW7.png altenter image description herep  pOne of the responses to my other question asked me to ask my teacher to clarify what an arraylinked hierarchy is. After I asked her, she said that its just an array of nodes. p  pI think the array of nodes goes with what laune  said, in that  is a technique that is used if you have a limited set of nodes of a fixed type, held in an array Node[]  new Node[CAPACITY], one field of Node being an int  the index. The payload is anything, as usual. You have, initially, all nodes in an avail list, linked 012, with payload being the data that the node holds, which includes, the data and its links its holding .p  pSo from all of that, this is what the data structure looks like in my head p  precodepublic class NodeArray     private ListNode[] elementData     ...    private class ListNode          private int data         private ListNode next         ....       codepre  pWhat advantages dos this array of nodes data structure have to just regular linked list and array lists I cant see a situation of why you would want a data structure like this. To me, its just another from of ArrayList because array lists are generic, their arrays could work with any type, including a list node.p

Negative 391 pIm quite new to python and programming in general and im currently doing an online course at Grok Online. Currently i am stuck on the second course Robots in a line as the brief is to design a program that reads in a line of text and prints out whether the word robot appears, although it has to figure out whether the word is lowercase, uppercase or mixed case. This is my solution thus farp  precodetext  inputLine   if robot in text   printThere is a small robot in the line.  elif robot.upper in text   printThere is a big robot in the line.  elif robot or ROBOT  text.isupper and not text.islower   printThere is a medium sized robot in the line.  else   printNo robots here. codepre  pAnother thing is that the program has to distinguish the word as an individual string, so it would print True for robot but false for strobotron.p

I know why, because the header has already been sent out  meaning, browser has started to output and cant redirect. I got that part. But then, how do I use this function properly I cant wrap my head around this one.p  pI tried using the good old codeheaderLocation httpwww.example.comcode response. No luck with that either.p  pCan anyone elaborate on this Thanks.p
Negative 391 pIm working with a data table which has a column of results which begin as character values codechrcode. Because I need to do mathematical calculations with some of these values I copy the original column, but change the values which are nonnumerics to specific numeric values. For example I use 999 for a result value of Not reported and set up similar substitute values for the nonnumeric characters. Other collected values are numbers such as 7.3 or 238. Result values vary based on the instruments used in collection and the characteristic being reported.p  pHeres a small sample of the data table codedtcode other columns excluded.p  precodeRESULTVALUE    RESULTTRANSLATED 43.2               43.2000 Not reported      999.00000 0.19               0.19000 0.058              0.05800 codepre  pThe codeRESULTTRANSLATEDcode values are converted using codedtRESULTTRANSLATED lt as.numericas.characterdtRESULTVALUEcode.p  pOption values for codescipencode and codedigitscode are 0 and 7 respectively.p  pThe codescipencode was set to 0 to force a column of location identifiers separate column not shown above to display as nonscientific numbers e.g. 23434 vs 2.3434e04. codeDigitscode was set to 7 to enable display of recorded field data without truncating values or decreasing their significant figures.p  pWhat Id like to see is a result more along these lines for the conversionp  precodeRESULTVALUE    RESULTTRANSLATED 43.2               43.2 Not reported      999 0.19               0.19 0.058              0.058 codepre  pHere, the translated data reflects the significant figures for the results versus adding accuracy that doesnt exist. So values like 0.058 dont imply a measurement of 0.05800 or 0.19 doesnt imply 0.19000 .p  pUnfortunately its appearing I cannot have my cake the location identifiers without scinotation and eat it too have proper accuracysig figs in converted results values. While I emcouldem ignore the location identification scientific notation possibly changing it to a codechrcode vs a codenumericcode column, changing the accuracy of the measurements is something I need to avoid. p  pPerhaps someone can enlighten me as to whether this is possible, particularly when the result set includes results reported from instruments with varying accuracy. Ive searched through the various resources and found some related topics, but nothing that quite addresses the issue.p  pThanks for your kind assistancedirection.p

Negative 391 pIs there a standard or at least safe way to compare unions for equality in C andor C I expect that bitwise comparison would be useful in a number of scenarios emregardlessem of the lastassigned member in each union for instance, a particular bitpattern could be reserved to mean value is uninitialized, and it would be useful to be able to check if the union is uninitialized without needing to specify an active member.p  pAn example in C though I think the concept extends to C using nonmember functionsp  precodeunion MyData    public      Assume Im compiling this on a platform where the size of int      exceeds the size of char, or that Im using some combination      if ifdefs or similar to ensure that my numeric type is sufficiently      large, or that I include an extra member that is known to be      exactly the size of the larger member, just for the sake of      comparison.     int intmember     char ptrmember      bool isInitialized const            return this  INVALIDVAL           bool operatorMyData constamp rhs            return             private     constexpr MyData INVALIDVAL         ... later, in client code...  MyData d bool initializedd.isInitialized   false d.ptrmember  new char[32] bool initializedd.isInitialized   true codepre  pHere, codeINVALIDVALcode could probably be defined by setting codeintmembercode to the max negative int value, because thats an uneven value, so it wont be on a word boundary and therefore is highly unlikely to ever be assigned to the codecharcode  member assuming that assignments typically come directly from codenewcode.p  pOne possible implementation of codeoperatorcode would be simplyp  precodereturn intmember  rhs.intmember codepre  pEven though its not known whether codeintmembercode is the active member, I expect this to be safe, because I see no reason why a static cast from codecharcode to codeintcode should fail or be problematic. Is that correctp  pIf this implementation emisem unsafe, something like the following should be possible using Cstyle casts in C, of coursep  precodereturn staticcastltvoidgtthis  staticcastltvoidgtrhs codepre  p...though of course if codeMyDatacode is larger than the size of a pointer, youd have to start messing around with codesizeofcode to make this work.p  pDoes anyone do this Is the first simpler implementation safe Is there any reason emnotem to do itp

I am trying to transform that into ExpectedResults. Were reporting on changes to roleId and locationId. On each change, it needs to have a separate line for each column.

If both fields are updated in the same UPDATE statement, then that would result in two update rows in Expected.p  pI started with a Cursor, but was hoping there would be a more efficient way to achieve this. p

Negative 391 pIm building a map that plots cities, where the radius of the city dot is adjusted by population.  We want only the larger cities to be noticeably larger at a glance.  Ive tried using a logarithmic scale, but thats giving me the reverse where the radius scales up quickly.p  pIve tried using log.invert, but anything but the smallest numbers give a result of infinity.p  pAs a note I dont really know how logarithmic or other scales work mathematically.  Ive only ever applied them to my visualizations.p  pSimplification of my code     var radiusScale  d3.scale.log.domain[1,8000000].range[1,3]p  pEDIT What Ive ended up needing to do was use d3.scale.sqrt then adjusting the domain to exclude the outlier large cites, which brought the high end of the domain down to 800,000 from 8,000,000.  This is giving us the effect of cities slowly scaling up, with an acceleration of the scale where logarithmic was the reverse of quickly scaling with deceleration.p

Negative 391 pIm creating a module with several classes in it.

Negative 391 pSo heres the finished product, a statement of accounts with a working statement table, and an ageing analysisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com5L2xK.png altStatement of accounts samplep  pEverything works great. It basically populates itself row by row with data from another table.

Hence if its perfectly divisible, the result  0. j  12 helps to skip past the header logos, youll understand why in the next picture.p  pSo the line of code basically works if you didnt care about the subsequent table formatting ltp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comhzEPw.png altbad table formatting on other pagesp  pSo does anyone know how do I continue with the previous tables formatting, ie the green and white statement table in the original page in the second page Or is there some way to preload the table formatting in the second page bearing in mind that not all statements need a second page. Or perhaps even tinkering about the print settings when the pagebreak triggers Or any other creative solutionsp  pI have had zero experience with dealing with multiple pages using VBA, and quite frankly, I do not even know how to go about navigating between pages. I cant stress hard enough that this code is my amateur attempt to do useful things with excel, so there must be room for improvement p

Negative 391 pIve developed an AngularJS SPA application, Im seeing issues with my js files being mixed with the older versions because of cache even after the new deployment.

Negative 391 pIm using Bootstraps dropdown functionality with an input control to allow the user to either select  predefined values from a list or enter an arbitrary new one. Using jQuery Ive attached a blur event so that when the user clicks outside the input it can do a minimal syntax check to see if it is an allowed value. If so, an AJAX event is fired to updated that value in the users profile.p  pIf that input control is currently focused for typing in it which has opened up the Bootstrap dropdown, if it is clicked upon a second time, such as clicking to move the text cursor around for editing the value being typed in, that attached blur event fires even though the input control it is firing on is retaining focus. The same thing happens with a focusout event instead of blur.p  pIs this the expected result with events, that the input control is actually losing and then immediately regaining focus The event.target value is the id of the element on which I attached the event, indicating this isnt bubbling from some other element, but could Bootstrap still have doesnt something funky and stolen focus when the dropdown appeared without somehow triggering the blur event thenp  pRegardless of how this is happening, can I stop it or work around itp  pThe HTML for the dropdown looks like thisp  precodeltdiv classdropdowngt   ltdiv classinputgroup idlalbumdrop datatoggledropdowngt     ltinput classformcontrol idldefaultalbumgt     ltspan classinputgroupaddongt       ltspan classcaret dropdowntoggle stylefloatrightgtltspangt     ltspangt   ltdivgt   ltul classdropdownmenu styleheight auto maxheight 256px width 100 overflowx hidden border silver solid 1px padding 2pxgt     ltli classdefaultalbumselectoritem dataalbumNameEverypost Photos dataalbumID10154456500750072 dataalbumLinkhttpswww.facebook.comalbum.phpfbid10154456500750072ampid10154515744420072ampaid1073741841 dataalbumCoverPhotohttpsscontent.xx.fbcdn.nethphotosxtf1t31.0811807144101559081799950723021817604288183977o.jpggtEverypost Photosltligt     ltli classdefaultalbumselectoritem dataalbumNamePiquero Photos dataalbumID10155857109655072 dataalbumLinkhttpswww.facebook.comalbum.phpfbid10155857109655072ampid10154515744420072ampaid1073741850 dataalbumCoverPhotohttpsscontent.xx.fbcdn.nethphotosxpa1vt1.0911760176101558571096900726083087322575761598n.jpgohc9861bd544f33bfd9b77fe9550943914ampoe5649D88DgtPiquero Photosltligt   ltulgt ltdivgt codepre  pThe javascript for the event looks like thisp  precodedocument.readyfunction ldefaultalbum.on   blur,   functione      if typingLinked.newAlbumName        clearTimeouttypingLinked.newAlbumName          ldefaultalbum.closest.dropdownmenu.prev.dropdowntoggle     checkDefaultAlbumCharacters     codepre  pstrongEditstrong I am using Chrome Version 44.0.2403.130 64bit from the Google repo on Ubuntu 15.04 64bit.p

Negative 391 pI am trying to teach myself confirmatory factor analysis by working through examples in a textbook. The textbook only contains syntax for LISREL or SAS but Im trying to learn it with R. When I estimate models without any equality constraints or correlated errors, I get the exact same output as the book.

Negative 391 pI am currently working on STM32F3 Discovery Board. I wrote a basic program in C to see if it works at 72 MHz which is about 14 ns in time. Hopefully it worked at this frequency, but when I want to toggle just one random pin on the device, turning it ON or OFF takes 660 ns in an infinite while loop. Then I checked with an oscilloscope, how much each command takes. Values might not be exact, Here is what I found a while looponly for checking  120 ns, a for looponly for checking  160 ns One turn of a while loop  280 ns, one turn of a for loop  320 ns, which means each turn takes 160 ns. asmNOP  14 nswhich must be equal to operator frequency72 MHz, as expected, an empty function call  225 ns I dont think these values are same for other compilers, or other computers, but I am not even close to 72 MHz.

Negative 391 pIm working on a image editing software which includes a few classes. But I need my code to be more generic. But Ive got a big problem with my classes when it comes to connections.p  precodeQObjectconnectactionSmartContrast, SIGNALtriggeredbool, effectsWindow, SLOTaddSmartContrast QObjectconnectactionSaturation, SIGNALtriggeredbool, effectsWindow, SLOTaddSaturation codepre  pIve got a Menu called Effects, and when the user clicks the codeQActioncode codeactionSmartContrastcode, then the effect Smart Contrast is added to my effects window. The thing is, given that each effect has its own class, I have to create a function for each class as you can see in the code above. And this is very repetitive. I would like to avoid this problem by doing something like thisp  precodeQObjectconnectactionSmartContrast, SIGNALtriggeredbool, effectsWindow, SLOTaddEffectnew SmartContrast QObjectconnectactionSaturation, SIGNALtriggeredbool, effectsWindow, SLOTaddEffectnew Saturation codepre  pEverything would be fine for the function codeaddEffectcode because it expects a pointer to an Effect object and both SmartContrast and Saturation inherit from Effect. The only problem is that it is impossible to pass variables in codeconnectcode like this. So I thought of subclassing codeQActioncode and creating a signal which would return the class I like everytime but again, how to tell my new Action class what class it should return If I have a thousand effects, I wont subclass codeQActioncode a thousand times I need to create a function which would take for example a pointer to a codeSmartContrastcode object and it will guess that it has to return a codeSmartContrastcode pointer everytime the Action is clicked. And that would still be possible to do it because of the inheritance from the class codeEffectcode. But I really cant figure out how to do that. Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks in advancep
