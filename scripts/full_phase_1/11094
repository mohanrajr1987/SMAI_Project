Positive 11094 pI am new at this so I ask for some leeway and understanding. I am using VB.NET to screen scrape a table off a website and put it into a dataset. I can put it a codeDataGridViewcode and save the dataset to MS Access database using codeInsertcode. The problems occurs when I use the program the next day and new records are added. I cannot figure out how to add just the new records only.

We name the reports with the source in the name.  i.e. Report 1 UAT.  Users do not pay attention.  When a report is run and exported, you can no longer see the name so what looks like a production report could be a UAT copy.  What I am trying to do is add a placeholder in the title that lists the data source for the reports primary dataset.  I thought I would find a resource that said dataset1.datasource that returned the name I had assigned the data source at creation.  That does not appear to be the case. Any ideas how to accomplish the same thing.p

Positive 11094 pI am very new to using R and I am having a problem merging or joining two datasets. The first dataset has 47 columns and 143,473 and dataset two has 34  and 2243 rows. p  pThe first dataset consists of fishing hauls with a number of variables that are of interest pertaining to that haul. There is a column called link3 that is a value for a haul from a fishing trip.p  pThe second dataset consists of biological data where each row is a single instance for a seal. There is a column called link3 that is a value for a haul from a fishing trip. There can be several rows that have the same link3.

I was successfully able to do this portion.p  pI am having a problem merging or joining the results of summing the takes of seals by species into the first dataset. I need to add the columns I created for each seal species in the second dataset onto all of the hauls in the first dataset, but keep all of the information from the second dataset intact.

Negative 11094 pWeve found that the unit tests weve written for our CC code have really paid off.  But we still have thousands of lines of business logic in stored procedures, which only really get tested in anger when our product is rolled out to a large number of users. p  pWhat makes this worse is that some of these stored procedures end up being very long, because of the performance hit when passing temporary tables between SPs. This has prevented us from refactoring to make the code simpler.p  pWe have made several attempts at building unit tests around some of our key stored procedures primarily testing the performance, but have found that setting up the test data for these tests is really hard. For example, we end up copying around test databases. In addition to this, the tests end up being really sensitive to change, and even the smallest change to a stored proc. or table requires a large amount of changes to the tests. So after many builds breaking due to these database tests failing intermittently, weve just had to pull them out of the build process.p  pSo, the main part of my questions is has anyone ever successfully written unit tests for their stored proceduresp  pThe second part of my questions is whether unit testing would beis easier with linq p  pI was thinking that rather than having to set up tables of test data, you could simply create a collection of test objects, and test your linq code in a linq to objects situation I am a totally new to linq so dont know if this would even work at allp

So, each object member field would connect out to the reception connector on the object of the members type.  In and of itself those objects are fairly easy to build.  The problem I ran into is that the connector lines didnt respect the objects and ran over the top of them, making an awful, unusable mess.p  pThanks for any pointers.p

Negative 11094 pIve read a few answers on here that condemn the use of svnexternals.  I do see how they can be misused, and it does make us more dependent on Subversion, but I really dont see our group moving away from it anytime soon.  p  pAnyway, heres my dilemma.  We have Solutions that reference multiple Projects which are in their own section of the repository.  Many of these Projects are shared between multiple Solutions, and we also dont want to preclude the sharing of our Projects.  We also have several fixed version dependencies checked into our repository unit test frameworks, libraries, etc..  p  pI would like to configure several workspaces that use ONLY externals as far as Subversion is concerned they would just be empty directories, or contain maybe a single solution file to configure Solutions for our developers.  Checking out most Projects on their own wont be enough to build them, but checking out its workspace will be enough to build it because all its dependencies will come with it.  Has anyone else implemented a similar solution, and would svnexternals be a good way to go about this  What words of caution do you have for me if we go down this roadp  pBasically the structure would look like this trunkbranchestags omitted for brevityp  precodeprojects    project1    project2 dependencies    xUnit       1.5       1.4    NHibernate       2.1.0       2.0.1 workspaces    project1       project1 external to projectsproject1       xUnit external to dependenciesxUnit1.5       NHibernate external to dependenciesNHibernate2.0.1    project2       project2 external to projectsproject2       xUnit external to dependenciesxUnit1.4       NHibernate external to dependenciesNHibernate2.1.0 codepre

Negative 11094 pI am in the process of writing a diff text tool to compare two similar source code files.p  pThere are many such diff tools around, but mine shall be a little improvedp  pIf it finds a set of lines are mismatched on both sides ie. in both files, it shall not only highlight those lines but also highlight the individual changes in these lines I call this interline comparison here.p  pAn example of my somewhat working solutionp  pimg srchttpfiles.tempel.orgtmpdiffexample.png altalt textp  pWhat it currently does is to take a set of mismatched lines and running their single chars thru the diff algo once more, producing the pink highlighting.p  pHowever, the second set of mismatches, containing original 2, requires more work Here, the first two right lines added line ab were added, while the third line is an altered version of the left side. I wish my software to detect this difference between a likely alteration and a probable new line.p  pWhen looking at this simple example, I can rather easily detect this casep  pWith an algo such as Levenshtein, I could find that of all right lines in the set of 3 to 5, line 5 matches left line 3 best, thus I could deduct that lines 3 and 4 on the right were added, and perform the interline comparison on left line 3 and right line 5.p  pSo far, so good. But I am still stuck with how to turn this into a more general algorithm for this purpose.p  pIn a more complex situation, a set of different lines could have added lines on both sides, with a few closely matching lines in between. This gets quite complicatedp  pId have to match not only the first line on the left to the best on the right, but vice versa as well, and so on with all other lines. Basically, I have to match every line on the left against every one on the right. At worst, this might create even crossings, so that its not easily clear any more which lines were newly inserted and which were just altered Note I do not want to deal with possible moved lines in such a block, unless that would actually simplify the algorithm.p  pSure, this is never going to be perfect, but Im trying to get it better than its now. Any suggestions that arent too theoerical but rather practical Im not good understanding abstract algos are appreciated.p  pemstrongUpdateemstrongp  pI must admit that I do not even understand how the LCS algo works. I simply feed it two arrays of strings and out comes a list of which sequences do not match. I am basically using the code from here a hrefhttpwww.incava.orgprojectsjavajavadiff relnofollowhttpwww.incava.orgprojectsjavajavadiffap  pLooking at the code I find one function equal that is responsible for telling the algorithm whether two lines match or not. Based on what Pavel suggested, I wonder if thats the place where Id make the changes. But how This function only returns a boolean  not a relative value that could identify the quality of the match. And I can not simply used a fixed Levenshtein ration that would decide whether a similar line is still considered equal or not  Ill need something thats selfadopting to the entire set of lines in question.p  pSo, what Im basically saying is that I still do not understand where Id apply the fuzzy value that relates to the relative similarity of lines that do not exactly match.p

Negative 11094 pThis might be a dumb question to some of you and maybe I asked this question wrong, because I am new to c. But I notice when working in a lot of win32 applications, you use a lot of resources that are pointers. Why do you have to always acquire a objects pointer  why not initiate a new instance of the class. and speaking of that, I notice in most cases you never initiate new objects, but always call on methods that return that pointer. What if that pointer is being used somewhere else. couldnt you mess something up if you alter that pointer and it is being used somewhere else. p

Negative 11094 pI am using Cucumber as the BDD framework with rspecmocha mocking. Ideally we would not mockstub behavior in cucumber specs however the scenario is exceptional here. To give you the brief idea of problem here I have two features product feature and cart feature.p  pCart feature is currently mocking some of the product fetch from 3 party system. And in cucumber run cart feature runs before product feature. Product feature uses real call for some scenarios. Ideally we would expect that Class level stubs like Product.stubfind would be cleared once the scenarios are completed however that is not the case. Class level stubs linger on to the next cucumber scenario run and interfere with the call.p  pI interchangeably used mocha and rspec to induce the stubs but no avail in either case the stub remains and prevents my product feature to run after cart feature. Both of them run fine in isolation. p  pHas anyone faced similar issue of stubs not being reset in cucumber Is there a way, I can restore the original class behavior p  pAny help will be appreciated.p  pCheersp

The problem is, he is much more experienced than me, and hes kind of hate ORMs he didnt explain why, but he said that its confusing. Im on my own now, but im not encouraged enough to switch to an ORM. p  pThen, should I switch to an ORM or not if yes, please encourage me. p  pEDIT I dont know why someone need to close this question.

However I cant figure out what the problem is, and unless I do I cant move forward with my own code.p  pI will paste what I consider to be the appropriate code into this post but luckily all the code is available online at a hrefhttpexamples.oreilly.com9780596804831HelloCone relnofollowhttpexamples.oreilly.com9780596804831HelloConeap  pThe problem I am having is with their OpenGL ES 2.0 renderer, it does not show up in their ES 1.1 renderer. p  pSo what I have been noticing is that the cone does not render exactly in the correct position. To test this I changed the ModelViewMatrix to render exactly on the FrustumNear plane. So the cone should appear cut completely in two. When I do this with the ES 1.1 render this is the case, when I do the same in OpenGL ES 2.0 however it is not. The cone is for the most part there, but slightly shaved off. Meaning it is not landing exactly on the fustrums near face.p  pHere is the initialization code where the projection matrix is created and set upp  precodevoid RenderingEngine2Initializeint width, int height  const float coneRadius  0.5f const float coneHeight  1.0f const int coneSlices  40        Allocate space for the cone vertices.     mcone.resizeconeSlices  1  2       Initialize the vertices of the triangle strip.     vectorltVertexgtiterator vertex  mcone.begin     const float dtheta  TwoPi  coneSlices     for float theta  0 vertex  mcone.end theta  dtheta            Grayscale gradient         float brightness  abssintheta         vec4 colorbrightness, brightness, brightness, 1           Apex vertex         vertexgtPosition  vec30, 1, 0         vertexgtColor  color         vertex           Rim vertex         vertexgtPosition.x  coneRadius  costheta         vertexgtPosition.y  1  coneHeight         vertexgtPosition.z  coneRadius  sintheta         vertexgtColor  color         vertex              Allocate space for the disk vertices.     mdisk.resizeconeSlices  2       Initialize the center vertex of the triangle fan.     vectorltVertexgtiterator vertex  mdisk.begin     vertexgtColor  vec40.75, 0.75, 0.75, 1     vertexgtPosition.x  0     vertexgtPosition.y  1  coneHeight     vertexgtPosition.z  0     vertex       Initialize the rim vertices of the triangle fan.     const float dtheta  TwoPi  coneSlices     for float theta  0 vertex  mdisk.end theta  dtheta          vertexgtColor  vec40.75, 0.75, 0.75, 1         vertexgtPosition.x  coneRadius  costheta         vertexgtPosition.y  1  coneHeight         vertexgtPosition.z  coneRadius  sintheta         vertex         Create the depth buffer. glGenRenderbuffers1, ampmdepthRenderbuffer glBindRenderbufferGLRENDERBUFFER, mdepthRenderbuffer glRenderbufferStorageGLRENDERBUFFER,                       GLDEPTHCOMPONENT16,                       width,                       height   Create the framebuffer object attach the depth and color buffers. glGenFramebuffers1, ampmframebuffer glBindFramebufferGLFRAMEBUFFER, mframebuffer glFramebufferRenderbufferGLFRAMEBUFFER,                           GLCOLORATTACHMENT0,                           GLRENDERBUFFER,                           mcolorRenderbuffer glFramebufferRenderbufferGLFRAMEBUFFER,                           GLDEPTHATTACHMENT,                           GLRENDERBUFFER,                           mdepthRenderbuffer   Bind the color buffer for rendering. glBindRenderbufferGLRENDERBUFFER, mcolorRenderbuffer   Set up some GL state. glViewport0, 0, width, height glEnableGLDEPTHTEST   Build the GLSL program. msimpleProgram  BuildProgramSimpleVertexShader, SimpleFragmentShader glUseProgrammsimpleProgram   Set the projection matrix.

Negative 11094 pI have a native Delphi TFrame that emulates Roy Tancks Cumulus Tag Cloud viewer, a WordPress Flash plugin.  What that plugin does is create a 3D sphere of words that spin around on the surface of a virtual sphere.  You can see it in action herep  pa hrefhttpwww.roytanck.com20080306wordpresspluginwpcumulusflashbasedtagcloud relnofollowhttpwww.roytanck.com20080306wordpresspluginwpcumulusflashbasedtagcloudap  pIn my application structure each word has its own TBitmap and to render the sphere I print all the words bitmaps to a temporary TBitmap and then BitBlt that temporary TBitmap on to the Canvas of a visible TPaintBox.  The render operation occurs on a TTimer timer event that happens every 50 milliseconds.p  pHowever, no matter how hard I try there is a noticeable jitter to the movement of the words, especially in comparison to the silky smooth movement of the Flash player.  I thought increasing the frame rate might help and I even tried using a Multimedia timer that updated every 10 milliseconds with proper locking and unlocking of all the Canvases due to the multithreaded nature of the MM timer.  Still jittery.  The only thing I can figure is that the calculations I do result in discrete pixel locations for each word to render at and that causes jitter.  In contrast, and this is supposition, perhaps Flash potentially does dithering to facilitate between pixel rendering or maybe does antialiasing in realtime and thats why it doesnt jitterp  pIn any case, is it possible to get the silky smooth motion I am looking for using native Delphi code  Or is the only way to do it is to go all the way to something like a Direct3D or OpenGL solution  I dont want to waste time tweaking this thing to death if its a losing battle.  On the other hand, if you have any tips Id love to hear them.  My guess is that if I do have to go the Direct3DOpenGL route its a big job and learning curve so if I could find a way to get this done in native Delphi code Id love that.p  pFOLLOWUP EDIT Would printing to a much larger virtual bitmap and then using a resampling method like that given here help to print down to the actual visible Canvasp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1976116scaleanimagenicelyindelphihttpstackoverflow.comquestions1976116scaleanimagenicelyindelphiap
Negative 11094 pI know that codeAndAlsocode is equivalent to codeampampcode and codeOrElsecode is equivalent to codecode. But emwhat is the cleanest way to achieve the equivalentem of Visual Basics codeAndcode and codeOrcode in Cp  pFor example, consider the following VB.NET code. The codeValidateForControlcode method performs some validation and returns whether the state of the specified control is valid. The entire input form is valid if all controls are valid. However, each control must be individually validated even if one is invalid which requires the operator not to shortcircuit. Visual Basics codeAndcode operator is perfect for this situation, but unfortunately theres no equivalent operator in C as far as I know codeampampcode shortcircuits.p  precodeReturn      Me.ValidateForControlMe.firstNameTextBox And     Me.ValidateForControlMe.middleNameTextBox And     Me.ValidateForControlMe.lastNameTextBox And     Me.ValidateForControlMe.streetAddressTextBox And     Me.ValidateForControlMe.cityTextBox And     Me.ValidateForControlMe.stateComboBox And     Me.ValidateForControlMe.zipCodeMaskedTextBox And     Me.ValidateForControlMe.phoneMaskedTextBox And     Me.ValidateForControlMe.emailAddressTextBox And     Me.ValidateForControlMe.checkInDateTimePicker And     Me.ValidateForControlMe.checkOutDateTimePicker And     Me.ValidateForControlMe.rentalUnitsGroupBox codepre  pAlso, for booleans, is codecode in C equivalent to codeXorcode in Visual Basicp

I guess there maybe some magic stuff in the Object class, to make the base type, which  extends from, be different between derived types.

Negative 11094 pIm sorry if this question is a bit obvious, but Im new to BlazeDS and cant seem to find an answer. Im running Java on a BlazeDS server with a Flex frontend. Id like to be able to instantiate my Java class only once, then have the Flex use the setters and getters to play with the data in the Java class in a sense, treating the RemoteObject as if it were an instance of the class. As far as Ive read this seems to be the way BlazeDS works, but every time I call any Java method from Flex, it calls Java constructors again, resetting anything input by the setter methods. Is there a way to have the server hold the instance of the Java class between method calls Thanksp

Negative 11094 pHello all I have a piece of software that I would like to run many different times, each for a particular value of a class field that is set in the classs constructor.br E.g, somewhere in the code is something along the lines ofp  precodepublic class Stuff     private double importantVal    public Stuffdouble val           this.importantval  val        public double doStuff           return 4  importantVal      codepre  pThis class and method is very far down in the programcallstack, so I cant merely call doStuff several times by itself.br I would like to test the program for various values of importantVal, perhaps by placing them in a file and iterating over them.  I worked out the easy bit of running the program many times , but I have no good idea of how to substitute different values of importantVal.  If all else fails I can always write a script that modifies the source code, but that feels ugly and adhoc.  Is there a more elegant solution involving injection, or something along those linesp

Negative 11094 pIs it possible to write t4 template  or if it already exists  which will be able to generate DTO classes based on the data in the .edmx filep  pI have to write DTO classes for the current project, and this process is kinda tiresome.p  pWhat I trying to acquire is to get DTO classes which will have scalar properties defined as simple auto properties, and navigation parameters as incapsulated instances of other DTO classes.p  pExample p  precodepublic class SomeClassDTO      public byte Id  get set       public string Description  get set               public OtherClassDTO SomeProperty getset      public IListltAnotherClassDTOgt Objects getset  codepre  pThis is a good starting point, what is more desirable may look like following samplep  precode ltsummarygt  Employee details DTO.  ltsummarygt public class EmployeeDetailsDTO      [Key]      public long Id  get set       [Required]      public string FirstName  get set       [Required]     public string Surname  get set       ...      public long PhotoId  get set        Home address properties.       public string HomeAddressAddressLine1  get set   This is just name of field, not flattened list      public string HomeAddressAddressLine2  get set      public string HomeAddressAddressLine3  get set      public string HomeAddressPostcode  get set      public short HomeAddressCountryId  get set      public long HomeAddressCountyId  get set      public long HomeAddressTownId  get set        public short HomeTelephoneCountryId  get set              public string HomeTelephoneNumber get set      public string HomeTelephoneExtension  get set        public short PersonalMobileCountryId  get set            public string PersonalMobileNumber  get set      public string PersonalMobileExtension  get set    codepre  pAs you can see this is a flatten DTO which represent composite structure and may be injected back to entities through ValueInjector SameNameFlatUnFlat injections.p  pThis is the ultimate goal, though any advices would be appreciated.p

Negative 11094 pI am a bit confused because during my development i encountered a problem that was only solveable by downgrading the maven release plugin from 2.2.1 down to 2.0beta9.p  pBasically my project was using git on github, so my scm entries in the pom were like   p  precode    scmgitgitgithub.comltusernamegtltprojectnamegt.git codepre  pRunning releaseprepare always failed because upon tagging this command was usedp  precode    git push gitgithub.comltusernamegt lttagnamegt codepre  pAs you can see the project name was omited.p  pI looked in the web and eventually i found a hrefhttpwww.sonatype.compeople200909maventipsandtricksusinggithub relnofollowthis linka p  pThat example was using version 2.0beta9 and it had one big difference, instead of using the git url it just used originp  precode            git push origin lttagnamegt codepre  pAnd with origin everything works.p  pUnfortunatly i dont find a tagattribute for the release plugin to always use origin instead of itgithub.comp  pFunny thing is  before tagging a push of the modified poms is done multi module project. And there the correct url is used.p  pedit Basically version 2.2.1 is right in using the scm url instead of origin but the tagging operation must not remove the project name from the url.p  pRegardsp

Negative 11094 pIm working with Coldfusion because I have to and we use iPlanet 7 because we have to, and I would like to pass clean URLs instead of the queryparam junk for numerous reasons. My problem is I dont have access to the overall strongobj.confstrong file, and was wondering if there were strong.htaccessstrong equivalents I could pass on the fly per directory. Currently I am using emApplication.cfcem to force the server to look at emindex.cfmem in root before loading the requested page, but this requires a strong.cfmstrong file is passed, so it just 404s out if the user provides empathtofileem but no extension. Ultimately, I would like to allow the user to pass strongdomain.compathtofilestrong but serve strongdomain.comindex.cfmq1pathampq2toampq3filestrong. Any ideasp

Is this safe command to use when you want to spawn a thread and do something in parallel p  psystem spawns a subprocess.

Further I have been rebuilding the grid by calling the Adapter again and again on every case of pinch zoom in or out but one or the other moment I get out of memory exception. Also I have tracked the intensity of pinch by taking the difference of coordinates between the old touch point and new touch point using the trigonometry formulae [x2x12 y2y22]12 . p  pTo summarize I am looking for helpsuggestions on two points 1 The way I have been tracking the intensity of Pinch Zoom inout, is this a correct way 2 What will be an optimized way of rebuilding the grid after the detection of pinch zoom inout.

Negative 11094 pIm looking for a custom visual component for Delphi 7 which handles scheduling on a calendar. Im not looking for an actual calendar, and Im definitely not looking for some overhauled licensed component. I just want a simple visual component, with a trackbarlike list of items. For example, along the left, I could have employee names listed. Each of those records stretches across the control. To the right, the X axis represents time, and each employee Y Axis record could have multiple time periods start..finish, which are not only displayed to the right of the employee, but also user can resize each period, drag them, delete them, etc. Its obviously going to be used for that exact purpose, for scheduling employee hours. I dont need anything which is integrated with anything else, such as database, I can do all that work myself. I just want a simple control that can be used for visually creating such a schedule.p

Negative 11094 pSo I have my site at codehttpexample.comfoocode under a directory, the main domain is for something else. p  pUsing .htaccess, Ive set up my pages so the URLs look like codehttpexample.comfooaboutcode, codehttpexample.comfoopollscode, codehttpexample.comfooregistrationcode, etc. This works great and the site loads fine and can be traversed without any Javascript issues.p  pNow, Id like to add some AJAX functionality to the navigation. If Im on codehttpexample.comfoocode and I click the navigation for About, it changes the URL to codehttpexample.comfooaboutcode and dynamically loads the about page in one section of the site. I also have this working.p  pI have two problems which involve handling switching between AJAX and nonAJAX URLs.p  ul lipIf Im on codehttpexample.comfooaboutcode and I click on polls, it would look like codehttpexample.comfooaboutpollscode which doesnt look very pretty. Ideally, Id want every AJAX URL to be formatted with just the main directory and a hash, like codehttpexample.comfooaboutcode.br Should I handle it by forcing an actual nonAJAX redirect to the index page with a hash symbol then load it from there  pli lipThe other problem is the reverse. If I send codehttpexample.comfooaboutcode to someone who has Javascript disabled, or maybe if someone links to it and a bot crawls that link, is there any way to handle that to redirect to the correct nonAJAX page or is this just an unfortunate fact of life Ill have to deal withpli ul
Negative 11094 pI am right now evaluating our options to migrate a web application which uses really smelly JSP with scriptlets and many disgusting design choices to JSF2 with Facelets. As the application is too big to do it in one go, I will have to have both technologies working side by side for some time.p  pThe JSPs use codejspusebeancode a lot. In order to get the old smelly JSPs and my new shiny Facelets to work together I would need to also include the same beans.

If there is a solution that only works when converting to svn, I can do a twostep conversion.p  pI see three possible ways to approach thisp  ol lisome combinations of options andor custom code for the cvs2svn step to fill each nonHEAD branch with the files that existed on HEAD at the time of the revisionli lisome sort of postprocessing of the cvs2svn output before the import into gitli liuse gitfilterbranch to rewrite the git history after the import into gitli ol  pAm I missing an easy solution Should I just accept the imperfect import and move on There is only one active branch other than HEAD right now, but it would be useful to have a full and accurate history to refer too.p

Negative 11094 pI have a folder with 3 different php scripts in it. email.php txt.php android.phpp  pI pipe emails andor txts to their respective scripts, and use http POST to send data to the android script.p  pOriginally I only had the email and txt, and using this is was all okp  precodedata  data fields condensed into a single string obtained from email or txt filename output.php newFile fopenfilename, w fwritenewFile, data fclosenewFile codepre  pNo problems, the scripts could openwrite to the file, and if it didnt exits they would create it. the folder was not writeable.p  pNow I have the android.php script and originally it could NOT opencreate the output.php until I made the whole folder writeable. Now it can create output.php if need be.p  pThe problem now, is that either scripts can createwrite to output.php HOWEVER, once the file is created by one of the scripts, the other ones cannot write to it Ie if the android script creates output.php, the email and txt scripts return errors if the email or txt scripts create output.php then the android script return errorp  pthe error being unable to stream fopen or something along those lines.p  pLorenzo user here on SO started to mention something about the users ie the email being piped would be seen as a different user to an http POST command. The scripts create output.php with permissions 644 no execute and only owner can write and I am unable to manually change the permissions to 777  although I would prefer to get a way that allows the scripts to create it  so I can empty the folder periodically for backup reasons and not have to remember to put it back in etc...p  pI am thinking I could merge the 3 scripts into one hopefully but would prefer not too. Does anyone have any other ideasp  pThanksp  pUpdate Since I am a new user and couldnt answer my own question p  pOk, so with the help of everyone who responded, I have worked out a solution The email and txt scripts are run by user owner and the htmlPOST is run by user p  pI had to make the folder chmod 777 in order for user  to workp  pWhen each script runs, it checks for the file output.php. If it didnt exist, then after the fclose I added a chmod 777  that way the scripts run by other users could openwrite it later. If the file already existed, then I didnt add the chmod because if it was the wrong user it created an error.  So a simple example of itp  precodedata  data fields condensed into a single string obtained from email or txt filename output.php  if fileexistsfilename newFile fopenfilename, w fwritenewFile, data fclosenewFile  else  newFile fopenfilename, w fwritenewFile, data fclosenewFile chmodfile, 0777  codepre  pThanks for your helpp

Negative 11094 pIf I understand correctly, with set you can create class variables on the fly, which will be public, as well as access privateprotected properties.p  pIt seems like usingp  precodesetname,value    thisgtdata[name]  value  codepre  pORp  precodesetname,value    thisgtname  value  codepre  p... would both result in all kinds of garbage in and out.p  pWith individual setters mutators, 1 for each protectedprivate property, you have individual validation control, but you have to write a bunch of setters.p  pIs there some way to take advantage of magic set and still validate depending on the property.p  pE.g. lets sayp  precodeclass stuff     private name  alphabet, limit 10 chars   private size  integers 1  10   private price  decimals 0.000  999.999    setproperty,value      thisgtproperty  value       thing  new stuff thinggtname  1234 thinggtsize  b thinggtprice  40 codepre  pHow would you validate the bad assignmentsp
Negative 11094 pMy question is more oriented toward Python, but it may also be about JavaScript or other scripting languages.p  pI usually develop with statically typed languages Java, C, ActionScript, ....p  pI like to use from time to time Python, and I also need to sometimes use JavaScript. These are dynamic typed languages. Nothing wrong with that, but I usually have lots of headaches to understand which parameters are needed in a function or in a method. It happens even if it is my own code with some docstrings Maybe because the eye has to look somewhere else than in the definition of the function.p  pOf course, the answer should be in the documentation. But sometimes it is not clear at all, or because of the use of duck typing the documentation may be itself hard to write emthe first parameter is a function which must have a quack method and a feathersarg method where arg is a stringem. What I would very like is a kind of argument description inside the language itself even if it would be optionnal, like in ActionScript.p  pWhat are your best practices to unambiguously describe the arguments of a functionmethodp  pWhat about creating a special decorator if using Python which purpose would be to check the type of data when we use it but as it will be used at runtime and not at writing time, what would be the point anywayp  pDo you think it should not be an issue That doing more than current docstring would confuse a developer, or that my mind is too statictyping orientedp
Negative 11094 pThis is a wierd one so I will explain it the best I can. I have a dopostback function which is used to update content within an update panel. When the postback happens, jquery is used to hide one div and show another.p  pIn ie8 when the dopostback is triggered my page loses most of its css within the update panel. I am using several stylesheets so most are unaffected. At first I thought it was a javascript problem but the code still works, its just that the page looks unstyled.p  pIs there a way of readding a stylesheet after postback using javascript p

How can I make the calendar get the mouse activityp  pAlso, there is extraneous padding around the outside of the calendar, and when hovered over it turns orange.

Negative 11094 pYou know if youre working with Repeater Controls youre not able to access the controls the generic way as far as I know. So we try to use const strings for most situations we have to work with strings in C.p  pSo Ive made a class with const strings. They define the ID names of the Controls inside a repeater. That makes it possible to access the controls in a more generic way than using the plain strings in code.

Part of the data object is the element itselfp  precodeelement  this, codepre  pThen, after all of the initialization is done, I call a public method from the init lets say I do it for functionality reuse purpose.

However, what I am unsure about is the performance of acquiring the data of the plugin from within a private or a public method. To me, it seems that at the top of every public and private method I have to execute the following lines in order to get the datap  precodevar this  this,      data  this.datatooltip codepre  pOf course, I wouldnt execute them when I have no need for whatever is stored in data. However, my plugin performs quite a bit of animations and state tracking and almost all of the functions require access to the data. As such, it seems like accessing .data in almost every private and public call is a pretty big performance hit.p  pMy question is whether anyone uses this plugin structure Im hoping that yes since jQuery recommends it and has found a different way of referencing the data without hitting .data in every function call.p

Negative 11094 pIn Java, is there any way to view the complete, untruncated stack trace e.g. by increasing the number of frames recorded, or otherwise get at the embottomem of a stack trace  Normally the stack trace is truncated from the top at 1024 frames worth, but for a stack overflow problem this is fairly worthless as you really need to see who made the call that triggered the recursion, down near the bottom.  Much better would truncation in the emmiddleem of the stack, but evidently Suns JVM isnt smart enough to do this.p  pPerhaps even some special Sunspecific flags  I tried reducing the stack size to the minimum allowable Xss1000 but thats still more than 1024 frames worth.p  pIn my case, Im trying to debug a stack overflow that occurs in a Hadoop mapper, but only when running on really large input.  I assume the problem comes because a recursive operation Scalas codefoldRightcode is being done on a really, really large linked list, and I need to rewrite it nonrecursively ...  but I need to know who made the call to codefoldRightcode.  This is a basic routine called directly and indirectly in a lot of places and theres lots and lots of code out there that Im working with, so this is highly nonobvious.p

Negative 11094 pIm using an FTDI USBtoSerial converter on linux. Im writing an application that implements the standard functionality of changing settings like baud rate, etc... The only thing that Im not sure how to get is the buffer size, e.g. if the user wants to know.p  pFor example in the javax.comm SerialPort API theres a method getInputBufferSize, so I thought there must be a way to check this on the device being used. So if Im using a USBtoSerial converter, is it possible to query it for the buffer size I checked the termios documentation and cannot see such a setting.p  pAny suggestions on this pleasep

So what I know is that you create an instance of UIManagedDocument and make a URL for it and where it will save files.

Negative 11094 pI have a normal, boring old array which has a lot of data in it. Lets say the array is structured like thisp  pcodemyArray  array a,b,c,START,d,e,f,END codep  pNow, I need to select only the values that come after START, but before END. So, in this example, I need to select the values d, e, and f. p  pHeres the tricky part START will always exist, however END may or may not this is how the data is returned from the server. If START and END both exist, then I just need the values inbetween the 2. if only START exists, then just select all the values from START until the end of the array. START does not have a fixed index its location changes depending on the data supplied from the server.p  pSo what would be quick, relatively painless way to rip out these values in between 2 specified values, and then save them to a new arrayp  pEDIT The only implementation I was able to get functioning was the one provided by nickb, further down in the comments.

pfor simple image, for example JPEG image only,  code ResultHolder resultHolderWithCGImageCGImageRefimagecode and code UIImage bitmapcode methods are called. for some complicated ones,  codeResultHoldercode will extract codemBitmapcode to codemDatacode, and then combine with sub coderesultHoldercodes codemDatacode to get the image. these methods work well if I load image in my main thread, but if I use GCD or codeNSThreadcode to load image in background it is easy to crash, especially when loading complicated ones in background. when the app crashes, the main thread state a CGSConvertBGR888toRGBA8888 method error, one of other threads is running the code[ResultHolder dealloc]code method, actually is codefreemDatacode. It seems there is a memory conflict between the loading thread and the main thread.p  pwhen the app crashes, the error is like this img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comXJuiS.png altenter image description herep  pI have struggled for this bug for days, but still cannot find how to fix it.

Negative 11094 pFirst time poster here. Ive found some great answers to other issues Ive come across but this one has stumped me and Im not sure the best way to go about it. Ive done some searching but havent found anything that looks like it is a solution. p  pI am building a table that is a basic BOM display. The function takes the desired part ID and spaces just used to indent the results for readability and checks each result for any child parts by calling itself again and so on. p  pThis works great if I set ASYNC to emfalseem and I get the desired results but I thought there might be a way to make this asynchronous and achieve the same results in a shorter amount of time.p  pAnd yes, I will modify it so its not updating the DOM with each call. I will change it to a variable so there is only one call in the endp  pAny help appreciated. p  precode FUNCTION   Traverse the BOM                  Check each PID for child parts               function traversebomsearchterm, spaces           spaces  ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbsp     .ajax         async false,          url speccollectorajax.php,         dataType json,         data   dataretrieve databasequery,                  table ProductStructure,                  order ORDER BY COMPRT02,                  search searchterm,                          success functiondata2                               If there is data, then print it out to a table                  if data2  0                                               Iterate through each entry and list the results                 .eachdata2, functioni2,item2                                              print the BOM entry info                     tablebom tbodylast.append lttrgtlttdgt  spaces  item2.COMPRT02  lttdgtlttdgt  item2.QTYPER02  lttdgtlttrgt                       Check for children under this part                     traversebomitem2.COMPRT02, spaces                                                                  else                                   ,          Error handling         error function xhr, ajaxOptions, thrownError               Print error message for debugging             alertthrownError                 codepre

Negative 11094 pI would like to debug a portion of an Android application for which I do not have the original Eclipse project that was used to build it.p  pI have built a code.jarcode file that implements an Android Activity. I use Eclipse to develop and debug it, and codejavacjarcode to build the code.jarcode with the appropriate classes. The code.jarcode is shipped off to a client, who then builds it into their application.p  pNow they would like me to debug something, and have provided me a .apk for their application that calls codeandroid.os.Debug.waitForDebuggercode. I do not have their source code or project. I install and run the application, and when it hits that call, I see the process in the Eclipse DDMS tab waiting on attachment it has the red bug icon. When I try to attach to the process in Eclipse, by clicking the Debug the selected process button, I get this error messagep  pemNo opened project found for lttheirapppackagenamegt. Debug session failedemp  pIs there a way for me to attach to this process, without the original application project If not, I will resort to codeandroid.util.Logcode statements, but I would rather not, for obvious reasons.p  pAs I wrote above, I have my own project with all the source code used to build the code.jarcode that was incorporated into this application. I have tried changing the package name in my test project manifest, but that does not appear to change anything as far as Eclipse is concerned.p  pThanks for any helpp

The variable middle should be codefirstprivatecode instead of codesharedcode as it may be changed by threads executing the two tasks. However, if I set variable begin and end as codesharedcode as showed in the code, the program will fail. I wonder why they codebegincode and codeendcode should  be codefirstprivatecode instead of codesharedcode. In my view, as the threads executing the two tasks keep the variable codebegincode and codeendcode respectively, they will not affect each other. On the other hand, the codeParallelQuickSortcode function is recursive, and thus there is a race in the variable codebegincode or codeendcode for example, in the parent function and in the child function. I am not sure about this suspect as the variables are in different functios parent and child function.    p

Negative 11094 pIn a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma13546801150634a previous answer I gavea, I responded to the following warning being caused by the fact that codeu0B95code requires three bytes and so is a emmulticharacter literalemp  precodewarning multicharacter character constant [Wmultichar] codepre  pBut actually, I dont think Im right and I dont think gcc is either. The standard statesp  blockquote   pAn ordinary character literal that contains more than one emccharem is a emmulticharacter literalem.p blockquote  pOne production rule for emccharem is a emuniversalcharacternameem i.e. codeuXXXXcode or codeUXXXXXXXXcode. Since codeu0B95code is a single emccharem, this is not a multicharacter literal. But now it gets messy. The standard also saysp  blockquote   pAn ordinary character literal that contains a single emccharem has type codecharcode, with value equal to the numerical value of the encoding of the emccharem in the execution character set.p blockquote  pSo my literal has type codecharcode and value of the character in the execution character set or implementationdefined value if it does not exist in that set. codecharcode is only defined to be large enough to store any member of the basic character set which is not actually defined by the standard, but I assume it means the basic execution character setp  blockquote   pObjects declared as characters char shall be large enough to store any member of the implementations basic character set.p blockquote  pTherefore, since the execution character set is a superset of all the values a codecharcode can hold, my character may not fit in the codecharcode.p  pSo what value emdoesem my codecharcode have This doesnt seem to be defined anywhere. The standard does say that for codechar16tcode literals, if the value is not representable, the program is illformed. It says nothing about ordinary literals, though.p  pSo whats going on Is this just a mess in the standard or am I missing somethingp

When you make a VBOIBO, you still need the buffer, so why would you need a separate buffer for VBOs and IBOs Is it just a matter of performance, or are there other advantagesp  pI suppose this would all be strongleveragedstrong against the difficulty of adding VBOIBO code as wellp

Negative 11094 pI would like to ask is it possible to run the GA with different seed to generate the initial solution and make analysis . However, at the beginning of applying GA, you have to produce number of population solutions. For example, You run the genetic algorithm using seed 12345 to generate initial solution , and then you populate list of random solutions from this initial solution, and continue applying GA steps to solve the problem.p  pThen you run the genetic with another seed for example 5678 to generate initial solution , and then you populate list of random solutions from this initial solution, and continue applying GA steps to solve the problem..p  pThat means the populated list in first run may contain the initial solution that has been generated in the second run.p  pMy question is , Is there any way I can use GA with different seed to make comparison and analysis , If not, how can I compare and make analysis , should I only use different instance file for the problem p

Negative 11094 pI m not an experienced programmer so please bear with me. As a consequence I will need to be specific on my problem which is about building an architecture to represent a power plant hierarchyp  pIndeed, I m trying to construct a flexible architecture to represent contracts and pricinganalysis for multiple type of power plants. I am reading the alexandrescu book about generic design patterns and policy classes as it seems to me a good way to handle the need for flexibility and extensibility for what I want to do. Let s detail a bit p  pPower plant can have different type of combustible to run be of different types  coal or gas or fuel. Among each of those combustible, you can choose among different subtype of combustible ones of different quality or Financial index. Among those subtypes, contract formula describing the delivery can be again of different types times series averaged with FX within or via a division,etc... Furthermore, you can be in europe and be subject to emissions reduction schemes and have to provide co2 crdits enters in the formula of your margin, or not which depend on regulatory issues. As well, you can choose to value this power plant using different methodology etc... etc...p  pThus my point is you can represent an asset in very different way which will depend on regulation, choices you make, the type of contracts you agree with another counterparty, the valuation you want to proceed and CLEARLY, you dont want to write 100 times the same code with just a little bit of change. As I said in the beginning, I am trying to find the best programming techniques to handle my program the best way. But as I said, I m new in building software achitecture. It appears to me that Policy classes would be great to handle such an architecture as they can express the kind of choices we have to make. p  pHowever, putting it in practice makes me headache. I thought of a generic object factory where Powerplant is my abstract type where functions like  void price or riskanalysis would be pure virtual. Then I would need to make a hierachy based on this and derive elementsp

Negative 11094 pI am trying to learn about socket programming as well as the WebSocket protocol. I know that there are python web socket clients in existence but I am hoping to just build a toy version for my own learning. To do this I have created an extremely simple Tornado websocket server that I am running on codelocalhost8888code. All it does is print a message when a client connects.p  pThis is the entire server  and it works I have tested it with a small javascript script in my browserp  precodeimport tornado.httpserver import tornado.websocket import tornado.ioloop import tornado.web   class WSHandlertornado.websocket.WebSocketHandler     def openself         printnew connection         self.writemessageHello World      def onmessageself, message         printmessage received s  message      def oncloseself       printconnection closed  application  tornado.web.Application[     rws, WSHandler, ]   if name  main     httpserver  tornado.httpserver.HTTPServerapplication     httpserver.listen8888     tornado.ioloop.IOLoop.instance.start codepre  pSo once I start up the server I try to run the following scriptp  precodeimport socket  sock  socket.socketsocket.AFINET, socket.SOCKSTREAM sock.connectsocket.gethostbynamelocalhost, 8888  msg  GET chat HTTP1.1 Host server.example.com Upgrade websocket Connection Upgrade SecWebSocketKey dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ Origin httpexample.com SecWebSocketProtocol chat, superchat SecWebSocketVersion 13.encodeascii printlenmsg  sentcount  sock.sendmsg printsent this many bytes, sentcount recvvalue  sock.recv1 printrecvieved, recvvalue codepre  pWhat I am hoping is that the server will send back the response header as specified in the RFC. Instead the sock.recv is hanging. This leads me to believe the server isnt acknowledging the websocket initial handshake. This handshake is pulled off of the RFC as well. I know that the websocket key should be random and everything, but I dont think that would cause the server to ignore the handshake the websocket key is valid. I think I can figure the rest out once I can initiate the handshake so I am hoping that there is just some misunderstanding in either how websockets work or how to send the initial handhake.p

Negative 11094 pI am trying to build a simple Gtkada UI from examples found on elsewhere on the Internet. For instance a hrefhttplists.adacore.compipermailgtkada2012September004201.html relnofollowthis onea.p  pThe examples usep  precodeGtk.Widget.ShowAll GetWidget Builder, mainwindow codepre  pwhich seems reasonable enough, but I cannot find GetWidget.  The author of the example cited above says eventually resorting to Gtk.Builder.GetWidget in the procedure body.  However GetWidget is not in Gtk.Builder.  The only GetWidget I can find does not apply to Gtkada.Builder.GtkadaBuilder objects.  The most relevant seems to be in Gtk.UIManager is that the correct GetWidget  I havent managed to make it work, if it is.p  pEven the a hrefhttpdocs.adacore.comgtkadadocsgtkadarmgtkadarmgtkbuilder.ads.html relnofollowdocumentationa says Gtk.Builder includes a function GetWidget.  My question is, where can I find the appropriate GetWidget, or absent that, how can I get a GtkWidgetRecord to give Gtk.Widget.ShowAll.  Or am I missing the point entirelyp  pMy Gtkada is from gtkadagpl3.4.2src.tgz, downloaded from libre.adacore.com on 5 June 2013.p  pThanks a bunch,p  pPhilp

Negative 11094 pAs many of you may know, Google has provided us with a nice a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comaboutdashboardsindex.htmlDashboarda that shows us the current distribution of active Android devices along certain characteristics, such as platform version or screen size.p  pIt would be nice to have some similar information, but counting devices only in a specific region or country. For example, I am a Hungarian developer currently working on applications that are almost certainly only useful for people living here, in Hungary. Thus, I dont need to know the worlds statistics, only the Hungarian subset  which would be slightly different due to lesser and later availability of the devices and general economical reasons.p  pSo far I could not find such statistics, so I ask you, have you ever stumbled upon something like that Or shall I write to Google and ask for this seemingly not too complicated featurep

Negative 11094 pSay I have 3 threads A, B, and C that are waiting for the monitor on an object O. Thread D currently has the monitor for Object O. When thread D calls O.notify, which thread gets notified first A, B, or C Is it based off the first of those threads to call wait on object O Perhaps I am speaking about the difference between notify and notifyAll If I were to guess, notify would notify the first thread to call wait and notifyAll would notify all threads that called wait AND the next thread to get the monitor would basically be at randomp

So Im sending messages from the main user thread or any other thread to the thread that is design to dealing solely with activeX.p  pHere how it looksp  hr  pre  procedure MythreadActiveX.execute begin    CoInitializenil   Try    ComObject       CreateOLEObjectCOMID    While not Terminated do   Begin    If PeekMessageMsg,0,0,0,PMREMOVE then      Begin      TranslateMessageMsg       DispatchMessage Msg      end      If FEvent.WaitForTimOutMswrSignaled then    Wait for command     Begin        FEvent.ResetEvent        Try        Case COMOrder of           Oder1Begin                  .........                 end               Oder2Begin                  .........                 end           end        FEventComplete.SetEvent      end    end      CoUnInitialize end  pre  pThis works like a charm with most COM server, but fails with other COM DLLServer, especially written in visual basic, where the I have noticed with process explorer that the ActiveX code is executed into the main thread despite what I did above  The consequence result in   main thread holding up  main thread memory corruption with large array for instance...  my app crashp  pWhat is the cause  is this related to ActiveX threading model  I would like to understand and to correct my code to cope with that In that case, the COM shall run in the main thread....p  pThanks Since I spent time on this, im ready to provide more information in order to understand p

Negative 11094 pI would like to connect to LinkedIn and extract some information via their API. The LinkedIn API uses OAuth 2.0.p  pAll the documentation that Ive read about OAuth both in the context of LinkedIn and generically, seems to assume that there be a user interface in the form of the popup window which grants access.p  pHowever, in my case, I just want to export data via a command line application which will not have a user interface. What Im really looking for is a simple way to emauthenticateem, not emauthorizeem. The connection credentials will be in a config file.p  pIs OAuth what I wantneed, or am I really looking for something elsep

Negative 11094 pI have a multithreaded application with many forms, but I have to instantiate some classes and call some initialization stuff before the creation of the forms.  Of course I have to execute the corresponding finalization code.p  pHere is a simplified example of .dpr filep  precodebegin   .dpr project file   LoadDlls   try     Config  TConfig.Create     try       Application.Initialize       Application.Title  Foo       Application.CreateFormTMainForm, MainForm       Application.CreateFormTOtherForm, OtherForm       ...other forms...       Application.Run     finally       Config.Free     end   finally     UnloadDlls   end end codepre  pThe problem here is that the code inside codefinallycode blocks get executed BEFORE the codeOnDestroycode  codedestructorcodes of my forms.  This turns clear looking at the codefinalizationcode section of codeFormcode unit p  precodefinalization   if Application ltgt nil then DoneApplication codepre  pAnd codeDoneApplicationcode calls codeApplication.DestroyComponentscode which effectively Frees all codeApplicationcodes owned Forms.p  pSo, Forms created with codeApplication.CreateFormcode will be destroyed after any code inside the main codebegin..endcode block.p  pWhat I want is that after codeApplication.Runcode all the forms are destroyed, so that their codeOnDestroycode event handlers can see the codeConfigcode object and the external functions defined in my dlls. Ditto if an exception is raised.  But I also want to have the standard Applications exception handling if codeConfig.Freecode or codeUnlodDllscode raise Application must still exist.  p  pNote that p  ul liId prefer not to use a codefinalizationcode block would it be possible in .dpr to keep code clearer and debuggableli liFor now, I prefer not to change too much code e.g. dynamically create forms li ul  pI think the simplest solution is to explicitly call codeApplication.DestroyComponentscode after codeApplication.Runcode. Do you think is there any drawbacks  Is there a more elegant solution p  pThank youp

Negative 11094 pWe use protocol buffers for communication between native C apps, but also between native C app and .NET application all is VS2012 via protobufnet r666. We rely in C heavily on the has functions that are available for an optional element. p  pE.g. if we have a message with a field optional bool, it can be that it is not set, it is set to true, or it is set to false.p  pIn C this can be checked with the function hasfield and if set then the content can be fetched with getfield function. If not set, and getfield is called, then the get returns the default, which if not explicitly set is false for a boolean.p  pThis works perfectly in C, but, in protobufnet however, we cannot seem to find the equivalent of the has function, and, when the message is received, the field is added to the message and its content is set to the default, being false. Its not a disaster that the field is there with the default, but the problem is that there is no has function to check whether it was set in the message.p  pPlease advise whether this is a bug or whether we missed something in protobufnet and that this actually is possible p  pThx in advance.

Negative 11094 pThere is a need to periodically execute some operations. Major requirements are br1 dont start next update cycle while previous didnt finish br2 dont start update if data obtained in previous iteration is still valid, i.e. time since last refresh is smaller than TTL value br3 there are separate say 10 threads required to do such updates.br There are a lot of questions of same kind on SO, so Ive found this implementation of PeriodicTaskFactory a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma1494540780733herea by a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers222434jimJima. br It is working as expected, but when it came to spawning multiple such factories concurrently, Im starting to experience some overhead during refreshes which deform whole process cancels few iterations that were about to happen.

Negative 11094 pI am working on an implementation of one of the a hrefhttpbigflake.commediacodecCameraToMpegTest.java.txt relnofollowAndroid Test Casesa regarding previewTexture recording with the new MediaCodec and MediaMuxer APIs of Android 4.3.p  pIve managed to record the preview stream with a framerate of about 30fps by setting the recordingHint to the camera paremeters.p  pHowever, I ran into a delaylag problem and dont really know how to fix that. When recording the camera preview with quite standard quality settings 1280x720, bitrate of 8.000.000 the preview and the encoded material suffers from occasional lags. To be more specific This lag occurs about every 23 seconds and takes about 300600ms.p  pBy tracing the delay I was able to figure out the delay comes from the following line of code in the drainEncoder methodp  precodemMuxer.writeSampleDatamTrackIndex, encodedData, mBufferInfo codepre  pThis line is called in a loop if the encoder has data available for muxing. Currently I dont record audio so only the h264 streams is converted to a mp4 format by the MediaMuxer.p  pI dont know if this has something to do with that delay, but it always occurs when the loop needs two iterations to dequeue all available data of the encoder to be even more specific it occurs always in the first of these two iterations. In most cases one iteration is enough to dequeue the encoder.p  pSince there is not much information online about these new APIs any help is very appreciatedp

Negative 11094 pIve looked high and low for a solutions for this and Ive gotten nowhere.p  pI want to develop an iOS app that is pretty much a simple tap, animate and play sound.p  pSo Id have a map of say a farm and when I click the sheep, it will animate and make some noise.

When you mouse over a div in the first set, it should display its corresponding div in the second set.

Negative 11094 pIm building a Python application that interfaces with several hardware subsystems, each of which has its own interface thread.  The design was for the subsystems to be very independent, with only highlevel data provided to the main app.  I just found out that some of the subsystems interact in complex ways that require the interface for one subsystem to get lowlevel data from the interface to another subsystem.p  pThe data is deep within the interface, and I dont want to refactor the overall system just to share this data the main app couldnt care less about it.p  pWhat Id like to do is apply a decorator to the specific item needing to be monitored class attribute, instance attribute, or a simple variable that would send a message event  value to a listener or spooler whenever the items value is updated.  The listener should be able to sleep on the message, so it can react quickly in realtime to changes, but the listener interface should also provide buffering if the listener has to poll for the data.p  pI do know the item being monitored must have its codesetattrcode call wrapped.  I got some hints from this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions18812341decoratingaclasstomonitorattributechangesDecorating a class to monitor attribute changesa, but it doesnt look at the listening side.p  pThe data could be sent to something like a pipe or queue, so the listener can be slower than the writer and not miss any updates.p  pBut how would the writer and listener connect  They are independent threads of execution, and different modules, so the data items could be assigned a globallyunique string name e.g., HyperBleegRate that would be a parameter to the decorator and also known to the listener.  The first attempted write or read they would be asynchronous would cause a pipe or queue to be created, with the write end returned to the writer and the read end to the reader.p  pIve looked at the Python introspection tools, but they appear to be passive, and dont generate triggers when a data item is updated.  The profiling tools add too much overhead.p  pIdeally, the execution cost of the decorator should be as low as a simple value copy operation, but at worst a cpickle call could be tolerated.  In the future it should be possible to use different communication methods list, deque, queue, pipe, UDP socket, JSON, ....  But a zerocopy solution would be ideal when the writer and reader share the same memory space.p  pOn top of it all, it should work crossplatform, including under Windows.  It must be threadsafe.  I suspect it may eventually become useful for several items to be monitored by a single listener in a codeselectcodelike way.p  pWhats the simplest way to start  Im willing to do the heavylifting to get this written, but Im needing some major clues.p  pI suspect something like this strongemmustemstrong already exist, and Ive simply failed to say the right magic words to the Search Gods.p

Negative 11094 pThis may simply be the limitation of Tkinter being main thread op primarily.  Is there a way to codecanvas.deleteALLcode in Tkinter when also using threads.  I have the program running, the long way around because it wont do anything but write over what is already on the screen when I try to codedeleteALLcode.  If I try to eliminate codeself.line1, self.line2code concept of writing back over the line of text with the background color before replacing the line with the new valuelike below and replace it with codedeleteALLcode then the it doesnt do anything but write right back over the line and in time makes the value unreadable.  Granted I do notice a bit of a tint of the original text still showing up on the screen with the way the code is written below.p  pAlso, is there a short way of jumping out of the codeself.aftercode loop once the child threads are all done running.

Negative 11094 pI have a class that goes to get objects from a web service. My consumption of these objects is not order dependent so I issue my web requests in parallel and am adding the results to a codeConcurrentQueuecode.p  pAt the same time, as the requests are being made, we can process the responses.p  pSo I would like to be able to iterate over the contents of the codeConcurrentQueuecode while my items are being added to it.p  pHow can I have one class fill up the queue and the other class empty it. It will almost certainly be emptied faster than it is filler, so I cant just enumerate it without having a codeyieldcode because the collection will be empty and wont wait.p

Negative 11094 pI want to design a changelog for a few tables. Lets call it table coderestaurantcode. Every time a user modifies the list of restaurants the change should be logged. p  pstrongIdea 1strongp  pMy first idea was to create 2 tables. One which contains all the restaurants codeRESTAURANTVALUEcode coderestaurantId, restaurantValueId, address, phone, ..., username, insertDatecode. Every time a change is made it creates a new entry. Then a table codeRESTAURANT restaurantId, restaurantValueIdcode which will link to the strongcurrent validstrong coderestaurantValueIdcode. So one table that holds the current and the previous version.p  pstrongIdea 2strongp  pIt starts with 2 tables as well. One of them contains all current restaurants. e.g. codeRESTAURANTCURRENTcode. And a second table which contains all changes codeRESTAURANTHISTORYcode. Therefore both need to have the exactly same columns. Every time a change occurs the values of the current table are copied into the history table, and the new version in the current.p  pemMy opinionemp  pIdea 1 doesnt care if columns will ever be added or not, therefore maintenance and adding of columns would be easy. However, I think as the database grows... wouldnt it slow down Idea 2 has the advantage that the table with the values will never have any old stuff and not get crowded.p  pemTheoretically I think Idea 1 should be the one doneemp  pWhat do you think. Would you go for Idea 1 or another one Are there any other important practical thoughts I am not aware ofp

Negative 11094 pWhat Id like to do is to convert a string from one alphabet to another, much like converting numbers between bases, but more abstract and with arbitrary digits.p  pFor instance, converting 255 from the alphabet 0123456789 to the alphabet 0123456789ABCDEF would result in FF. One way to do this is to convert the input string into an integer, and then back again. Like so pseudocodep  precodeint decodestring input, string alphabet    int value  0   fori  0 i lt input.length i      int index  alphabet.indexOfinput[i]     value  index  powalphabet.length, input.length  i  1      return value   string encodeint value, string alphabet    string encoded     whilevalue gt 0      int index  value  alphabet.length     encoded  alphabet[index]  encoded     value  floorvalue  alphabet.length      return encoded  codepre  pSuch that codedecode255, 0123456789code returns the integer 255, and codeencode255, 0123456789ABCDEFcode returns codeFFcode.p  pThis works for small alphabets, but Id like to be able to use base 26 all the uppercase letters or base 52 uppercase and lowercase or base 62 uppercase, lowercase and digits, and values that are potentially over a hundred digits. The algorithm above would, theoretically, work for such alphabets, but, in practice, Im running into integer overflow because the numbers get so big so fast when you start doing 62100.p  pWhat Im wondering is if there is an algorithm to do a conversion like this without having to keep up with such gigantic integers Perhaps a way to begin the output of the result before the entire input string has been processedp  pMy intuition tells me that it might be possible, but my math skills are lacking. Any help would be appreciated.p  pThere are a few similar questions here on StackOverflow, but none seem to be exactly what Im looking for.p
Negative 11094 pI have searched to find a way that I can clear cookies from a browser for a specific site just by appending parameters to an end of a URL.

I spent yesterday afternoon trying to find a BigCommerce arguement that allowed for this. After talking with support, they dont have a clearCart function that other shopping cart platforms has. They only have a clear item functionparameter that you can append to the end of a URL. p  pIf I could clear all the cookies created by my site by a user clicking on a link, it would clear the contents of the cart.

Negative 11094 pI have a relatively simple PhoneJS app wrapped in PhoneGap 2.9, being built using PhoneGap Build.  The app is using the NavBar layout.  When I load the app in Safari on an iPhone 5, the nav bar looks perfect, icons above text.  However, in PhoneGap, only the icons show up, no text.  I cant tell if the text is not rendering at all or if the entire app or just nav bar is pushed down below the screen, to the point where the text isnt showing.  I doubt it is the latter, because it would have to be pushed down just the perfect amount so that the icons render neatly, but the text is hidden.

I have also been looking at linux filesystem files that might contain this information from the driver, but I have found none.p  pI read this nice article from ATT which explains about mobile networks p  pa hrefhttpwww.research.att.comarticlesfeaturedstories201103201102EnergyefficientfbidxEv4RTIfUL9 relnofollowhttpwww.research.att.comarticlesfeaturedstories201103201102EnergyefficientfbidxEv4RTIfUL9ap  pThanks.p

Negative 11094 pI have a moodle system. I want to call the codewpsignoncode function in my Moodle code. This auto signs in the user into WordPress from Moodle, so that the user can view our private blog posts. From his Moodle login, i know the users WordPress credentials. p  pTo call this function, I need to include the codewpload.phpcode file. I believe codewpload.phpcode includes all the wordpress functions. Both wordpress and Moodle have the codegetuserscode and codegetcontextcode functions in them. This throws an error, saying that that cannot declare 2 functions with the same name. Also, codegetuserscode and codegetcontextcode functions are not used by codewpsignoncode.p  pHow do I solve this problem Is there any other file that i can include instead ofcodewpload.phpcodep
Negative 11094 pI have a modal form that is generated using bootstrap 3. It doesnt look like there is a reliable way to determine when that form is being shown onscreen. I am attempting to create one.  I attached two events to my DOM element that signal when it is shown and when it is hidden.p  precodejqmodalloginform  modalloginform[0] jqmodalloginform.onshown.bs.modal, function       jqmodalloginform.activeonscreen  true  jqmodalloginform.onhidden.bs.modal, function       jqmodalloginform.activeonscreen  false  codepre  pI tried to give an attribute named activeonscreen to the DOM element above. When I look at the DOM element in the debugger later, the attribute is not present. p  pI should mention that I am VERY new to javascript.  Is attribute even the right word to use here It looks like attribute is a bit of a misnomer as well. It could be an attribute of the object but could also be an attribute of the object.attributes attribute, right I assume the later is where styling ect., goes and is not what I want to change. Does anyone have some insight as to what I should be doing herep
Negative 11094 pIm having a problem with a script that writes to a log file during a backup procedure. Tested perfectly when called from the root shell, but fails when run from the cron demon.p  pBackup is done over a series of partitions and the onsite admin will rotate the drives in the top dock weekly. In order to know where the most recent backup is located Ive included the following linesp  precodesudo hdparm I devsdb  grep Model Number sudo hdparm I devsdb  grep Serial Number codepre  pIve tried this with a codegtgt batchbackup.logcode and without.

On a table, I record some informations about users current location, like latitude, longitude AND timestampp  pI choose timestamp because it is format agnostic.

Negative 11094 pI want to build a Recommender System themed movie recommendations refer to study P. Massa and P.Avesani. I have my own opinion on this, that the user must give ratings first before going to the review page. In other words, users can only give a review after giving the rating. p  pHowever, there is also review can change ones perspective on a movie, so the user can review first and then give a rating. p  pBut I had to choose one, so Im confused.  I want to use both methods. But actually desired is a review of the movie can only be raised when the movie has been given a rating.p  pI would be very grateful if anyone can provide suggestions and opinions here for me. Which is better, give rate then review or the review first and then give ratings Thank you.p

Negative 11094 pWhile working on my Android application, I recently check a task manager to see how memory my application is racking up.p  pRight now my application has two ad banners being executed by AdMob services and then an interface fragment for a Google Map. Aside from all that I then have a menu in which I utilize a container to which I add views to it in Java code. I prefer this over a listview as it is more light weight and easier for me to structure what I want to do with the views and I can use Androids native animation system when addingremoving the views.p  pThe views being added to the container are being added by a loop structure based on conditions. The views in their interface structure also have a small imageview utilizing a small local drawable.p  pAll of this is somehow adding up to my application 44.8 MB in memory which seems abnormally high from previous development numbers.

Thank you p  pEDIT Im building a sort of a Main Menu to select different options on a GUI for a raspberry pi based system, running on Debian. Its roughly like a set top box. In equivalence to the GUI based buttons on screen, It should be able to acquire a hardware based interrupt from external buttons that are connected to the GPIO pins that causes a new page to loada new activity to begin.p  pIf I understand correctly, the c part of the code must capture this pin change, and relay it to the QML part. I need to be able to do this.p

Negative 11094 pI am developing a process that works as a facade for all clients to access data reports size vary from 100 kb to few MB, with few thousands run each day but exact number is unknown and may vary significantly from day to day.p  pThe motivations behind building faade is we have several servers behind the scene that can generate the data but we want to have some sort of load balancing to make best use of all servers we have also the clients dont need to know a individual server they need to hit.p  pSo the faade selects a server, round the report and send back the data to client. So there are two IO involved here for a given reportp  ol liBetween Client and Faade serverli liBetween faade server and the processing nodeli ol  pI know this is little vague topic but how can I estimate the total IO to see if the faade is going to become a bottleneck in itself as all IO goes  through it. Any insight, tips would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 11094 pi may be going about this the wrong way and would appreciate guidance on how it should be done. p  pI have a windows 7 computer on which i have installed thinVNC a hrefhttpwww.cybelesoft.comthinfinityremotedesktopworkstation relnofollowRemote desktop applicationap  pi liked it because its cross platform and does not need the clients to install anything on their devices to connect to the computer.They simply use a HTML 5 enabled browser to connect.p  pThe purpose of this is so that they can get to a Microsoft access database on the computer, log in to it and perform some transactions.p  pNow, when one person logs in they see the desktop and interact with it and thats fine. However, when another person connects to the computer, they basically watch as the first user goes about using the database. Which i think is the purpose of this kind of softwarep  pSo i guess what i want is that each user gets their own fresh session if you like, like having the file on a network drive. So users connect to the computer,dont see others using the system and theres a folder where i have granted access to external users and placed the database in it. They will then doubleclick the file icon and be able to login etc.p  pSo what is the best way to achieve this ideally i dont want the user to have to install any software to be able to connect, but if its unavoidable then so be it.p  pthanksp

Negative 11094 pIm trying to change the code that brings down a cpu, and got into something I dont completely understandp  pOne of the things that happen after a core is removed from cpuonlinemask, is the resetting of the interrupt affinities. This is being done in the fixupirqs function, found in a hrefhttplxr.freeelectrons.comsourcearchx86kernelirq.cL361 relnofollowarchx86kernelirq.ca. The function resets interrupt affinities, then calls to mdelay1 which simply waits for 1 millisecond, and finally turns to handle possibly lost interrupts.p  pMy question is why is the call to mdelay1 necessary what can happen without it  My guess is that it takes time for the rerouting in the APIC to take effect... but Im sure that there is a more convincing explanation for this.p  pThanksp

Negative 11094 pIm making a Today widget for my app. My widget contains a UITableView with 10 cells. Each cells height is 50pt. Function is simple. If I touch up a button on cell, reload DB from sqlite and show them on cells. It works very well on simulator and iPhone 4s, 5, 5s, 6 except only iPhone6. I did remove widget and add again over 10 times, but Its not helpful for me. I did check memory and zombie. but that is stabilized under 10M and no leaks. How can I solve my problemp

Negative 11094 pAssume I have a C iterator that not only traverses a data structure but also applies a transformation to the elements when it is dereferenced.p  pAs a realworld example, heres an iterator that goes over the pixels in a bitmap, transforming the bitmapspecific pixel format into a convenient structurep  precodeclass ConstPixelIterator     public struct Pixel      float Red     float Green     float Blue     float Alpha       public ConstPixelIteratorconst Bitmap ampbitmap     ...standard iterator functionality...    public Pixel operator        Read from memory and convert pixel formatspecific bytes into Pixel structure      codepre  pNow if I wanted to implement a nonconst iterator i.e. let the user modify pixels, what is the best way to go about thisp  pSome ideas I consideredp  ul lipI could put accessor methods in the codePixelcode structure instead of plain fields and give it a reference to its owner to phone home. emThis would however mean that if the user changed R,G,B and A, I would convert the pixel into the bitmaps pixel format 4 times and write to memory 4 times.empli lipI could return a Pixel reference from the iterator and provide it with an codeUpdatecode method that needs to be called if the pixel was changed. emThis would be nonintuitive and risk users forgetting to call codeUpdatecode.empli lipI could always return the codePixelcode by value and provide a special assignment operator. emDoes break the standard iterator pattern  assigning to an iterator without dereferencing should move the iterator, not update the element it is pointing atempli ul
Negative 11094 pI am encountering issues with the CSS borderradius property on a strongdiv elementstrong that strongcontains an OpenLayers OL3 mapstrong.

Negative 11094 pI am currently trying develop a mobile app using the ArcGIS Runtime SDK on iOS.  Right now users receive a pushnotification requesting feedback when they visit a location predetermined using a feature layer.  What I would like to add to the pushnotification is a way for users to answer a three question 5star survey.  Results would need to be averaged and then populated back to the feature layer to be displayed via callout box to users.i.e. name, address, and 5star results would display.  p  pIm not sure where to start so I am open to any advice, tutorials, or workflows on implementing this or good Samaritans willing to hold my hand. I have tried to piece together pieces of information found in different forums but I havent found how to link it all together. Maybe using PostGIS in some manner   My skill level is novice, yet dangerousp  pI know these forums are sometimes known for disregarding beginners, so thanks  for taking the time to read my post.p

I thought perhaps I could get some help here.p  pIm trying to make a CURL request via PHP.

Via PHP, I can make a similar request, but instead of sending an imageFile, I simply send a URL the image lives at and the service uses the externally hosted image. By adding the codeimageFilecode parameter, the service should instead create a local copy of the image and save it there, which is the goal. So thats the only field that is varying between a working example and a nonworking one.p  pSo heres my current PHP code that isnt workingp  precode                localfileabsolute  realpathlocalfile                 cfile  new CURLFilelocalfileabsolute cfile is valid, Ive checked                 creativefields  array                 ...add all the fields that are fine because they work for the external hosting strategy, match those in the given CLI CURL request...                 creativefields[imageFile]  cfile                     ch  curlinithttpstheapi.comcreate.do                     curlsetoptch, CURLOPTPOST, 1                     curlsetoptch, CURLOPTVERBOSE, true                     curlsetoptch, CURLOPTRETURNTRANSFER, true                     curlsetoptch, CURLOPTFOLLOWLOCATION, 1                     curlsetoptch, CURLOPTCUSTOMREQUEST, POST                     curlsetoptch, CURLOPTSSLVERIFYPEER, false                     curlsetoptch, CURLOPTPOSTFIELDS, creativefields                     verbose  fopenphptemp, rw                     curlsetoptch, CURLOPTSTDERR, verbose                     response  curlexecch                     rewindverbose                     verboseLog  streamgetcontentsverbose                      echo Verbose informationnltpregt, htmlspecialcharsverboseLog, ltpregtn codepre  pMy verbose log gives me a 400 error from the receiving server that says codeHTTP Status 400  commonsMultipartFilemust be image or flash filecode. This fails for .jpgs, .pngs and .gifs .gif being what the tech guy is using. Ive also tried using both the PHP codeCURLFilecode class and the path with codecode at the beginning  both get the same error.p  pLike I said, by omitting the codeimageFilecode field and using the externally hosted strategy, the request works just fine, and the CLI version from the tech guy also supposedly works.

Here is what I getp  ul liI get, that you can convert binary numbers to decimal numbers by reading them from left to right, starting with a decimal value of 0, iterating over the digits of the binary number, adding 1 to the decimal number for every 1 you reach in the binary number, and multiplying by 2, when you move on to the next digit as explained in the last link. ul liBut why does this lead to the doubledabblealgorithm We dont want to convert in decimal, we want to convert in BCD. Why are we keeping the multiplying shifting, but we drop the adding of 1 Where is the connectionli ulli liI get, why we have to add 3, when a number in a BCDfield exceeds 4 before shifting. Because if you want that the BCD number gets multiplied by 2 if you shift it, you have to do some fixups. If you shift the BCD number code0000 1000code 8 and you want to get the double code0001 0011code 16, you have to add 3 the half of 6 before shifting, because by just shifting you end up with code0001 0000code 10 youre missing 6. ul liBut why do we want this and where is the adding of 1 happeningli ulli ul  pI guess I am just missing a little part.p

Negative 11094 pI was wondering how I could map RGB values to xycoordinates. For example, in some applications, I have seen circles where moving the cursor within that circle would change rgb values evenly. p  pIn my case, I have a square area and I would like to map an xy coordinate within that area to rgb value. I would only expect that RGB values would ne in the range [0, 255] given the xy area which lets say the values for x and y would be in the range [0, 100]. Also expect a gradual change in color so for example 1,1 could be 255, 0, 0 and a change in xy to 1,2 would result in a similar rgb 254, 1, 0 rather than a completely different color 129, 244, 65p  pCan someone show me the math behind this Better yet, some c code p

Negative 11094 pIm currently weighing up whether I should make the jump to angularJS for our mediumsized web application. As the application grows and grows, it is becoming somewhat more difficult to maintain as a result of spaghetti jQuery and just general age. Ive read and played a little with AngularJS, and from what I used it is pretty awesome.p  pThe problem is that our web application is in constant use, and I cannot take it offline for any real period of time. Is it possible to progressively change pages from nonangular to angularJS i.e. say, a page a week we have about 6 or 7 data rich pages.p  pEach page is usually isolated, and they dont usually rely on data from other pages apart from cookies and the occasional querystring.p  pIs this a sensible approach Can AngularJS and nonAngularJS pages play nice together Or would it be better to stick with JavaScript and jQueryp  pEDIT I realise this isnt a great question for SO, my bad. I forgot you arent meant to ask for opinions p

Negative 11094 pIm new to the concept of object oriented programming in java and I often encounter the following design problemp  pI often create classes with instance variables which are not known at the moment of initialization. These variables are filled over time. This is not a real problem since these variables are null until they are filled, my question therefore is more about the best practice in such situations.p  pLet me explain it with an example. I have a class codeCarcode. Every codeCarcode has a codecolorcode, codevMaxcode, codeweightcode, codehorsepowercode etc. p  pWhen initializing the codeCarcode only its codecolorcode, codeweightcode and codehorsepowercode are known.  codeCarcolor, weight, horsepowercodep  pThe codevMaxcode can now be calculated lets say codeweighthorsepowercode. What confuses me is, that the codeCarcode, after initialization is incomplete, meaning that the codevMaxcode will only be filled over time.p  pI found this quite ugly, and of course the carexample is simplified. I often have classes with 10 properties where some are calculated over time, which themselves later in the code are used to calculate even more properties of that object. It then becomes difficult to know which variables are already filled at a certain point and which are not.p  pI just wondered whether this is normal and the way OOP works, or whether such situations should be avoided. If yes, Id be glad for some designhints.p  pMichaelp

Negative 11094 pLets take an example to make it easier. I build a list which the constructor takes an codeintegercode and a codeListltIntegergtcode. My list will contains all the elements of the given list multiplied by the codeintegercode. My list does not store the new elements but compute them on the flyp  pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecodeclass MyList extends AbstractListltIntegergt implements RandomAccess      private final int multiplier     private final ListltIntegergt list      public MyListint multiplier, ListltIntegergt list          this.multiplier  multiplier         this.list  list           Override     public Integer getint index          return list.getindex  multiplier           Override     public int size          return list.size       codepre  pThen we can call codenew MyList3, listcode with codelist  [0, 1, 2, 3]code to get code[0, 3, 6, 9]code.p  pI would like to limit the developer to give to the codeMyListcode constructor a list which is also codeRandomAccesscode, to be sure he will not ruin performances.p  pI tried to change the constructor withp  pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecodepublic ltE extends ListltIntegergt amp RandomAccessgt MyListint multiplier, E list codepre  pcodeMyListcode is not the issue but now we cannot invoke the constructor without using an implementation of both codeListltIntegergtcode and codeRandomAccesscode like codeArrayListltIntegergtcode. So someone who have this list codeListltIntegergt list  new ArrayListltgtcode cannot do codenew MyList3, listcode Because it is declared with codeListltIntegergtcode instead of codeArrayListltIntegergtcode.p  pThe other solution I have is this onep  pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecodepublic MyListint multiplier, ListltIntegergt list          iflist instanceof RandomAccess               Do something like log or throw exception                  this.multiplier  multiplier         this.list  list      codepre  pBut now I cannot check at compile time if the list implements codeRandomAccesscode, and I need to use codeinstanceofcode and I hate doing this.p  pIm pretty sure there is a better way but what is itp

Negative 11094 pUpdated question.  Im having difficulty reordering the items within a collection view when the view is scrolling.  The reason for this is that the code for reordering the items is within UIGestureRecognizerStateChanged of a UILongpress gesture.

Negative 11094 pI have a UITableView with Custom UITableViewCells. The Cells can vary between 200.0 and 300.0 and height.p  pNow if you open Facebook, youll notice the scrolling in the News Feed is awfully choppy. However, this is likely due to that various videos that are loaded on every cell, and that the time taken in cellForRowAtIndexPath is greater than 13.67ms 1s60frames. Hence the choppy flicker.p  pQuora on the other hand has cells that are varying heights, between probably 150.0 and 400.0. It scrolls pretty smoothly however.p  pNow, when I scroll my tableView its as though my screen is jumping. I will scroll down, and every now and then may every new cell dequeue but not quite, its as if something higher up in the tableview got a few pixels shorter in height, and therefore the screen im currently viewing jumped up a few pixels. This is not whats happening, Im just trying to paint a picture of what it looks like.p  pNow I know its not a time related issue. My cellForRowAtIndexMethod is nowhere near 13.67ms. Its always around 3ms, so thats not the issue.p  p2 questions...p  p1 Is this typically indicative of an auto layout issuep  p2 Is there an accuratesemiaccurate way to calculate estiamtedRowHeight when you have such varied cell heights, or would having an accurate number here not fix this issue anyway Just an idea.p
Negative 11094 pWrite the implementation of the function codeT findMedian constcode that computes the median value in the tree in On time. Assume that the tree is a BST but is not necessarily balanced. Recall that the median of n numbers is defined as follows If n is odd, the median is x such that the number of values smaller than x is equal to the number of values greater than x. If n is even, then one plus the number of values smaller than x is equal to the number of values greater than x. For example, given the numbers 8, 7, 2, 5, 9, the median is 7, because there are two values smaller than 7 and two values larger than 7. If we add number 3 to the set, the median becomes 5.p  pHere is the class of binary search tree nodep  precodetemplate ltclass Tgt class BSTNode  public     BSTNodeTamp val, BSTNode left, BSTNode right     BSTNode     T GetVal     BSTNode GetLeft     BSTNode GetRight  private     T val     BSTNode left     BSTNode right     BSTNode parent ONLY INSERT IS READY TO UPDATE THIS MEMBER DATA     int depth, height     friend class BSTltTgt  codepre  pBinary search tree classp  precodetemplate ltclass Tgt class BST  public     BST     BST      bool SearchTamp val     bool SearchTamp val, BSTNodeltTgt node     void InsertTamp val     bool DeleteNodeTamp val     int Countvoid const     T findMedian const      void BFTvoid     void PreorderDFTvoid     void PreorderDFTBSTNodeltTgt node     void PostorderDFTBSTNodeltTgt node     void InorderDFTBSTNodeltTgt node     void ComputeNodeDepthsvoid     void ComputeNodeHeightsvoid     bool IsEmptyvoid     void VisitBSTNodeltTgt node     void Clearvoid  private     BSTNodeltTgt root     int depth     int count     int index  0  Ive added this member data.      void DelSingleBSTNodeltTgtamp ptr     void DelDoubleByCopyingBSTNodeltTgt node     void ComputeDepthBSTNodeltTgt node, BSTNodeltTgt parent     void ComputeHeightBSTNodeltTgt node     void ClearBSTNodeltTgt node     int CountBSTNodeltTgt node const     T findMedianBSTNodeltTgt node const   codepre  pHere is the count codep  precodetemplate ltclass Tgt int BSTltTgtCount const      Countroot   template ltclass Tgt int BSTltTgtCountBSTNodeltTgtnode const      if node  NULL         return 0     return 1  Countnodegtleft  Countnodegtright   codepre  pAnd here is the findMedian codep  precodetemplateltclass Tgt T BSTltTgtfindMedian const      findMedianroot   template ltclass Tgt T BSTltTgtfindMedianBSTNodeltTgt node const      int counter  Count     if node  NULL         return     T tmp  findMediannodegtleft     if tmp  NULL         return tmp     if index  counter  2         return nodegtval     index     return findMediannodegtright  codepre  pWhen building it I get the following errorsp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comqCTGu.png altenter image description herep  pAnyone has any clue how to fix this And will this code work with an even number of elementsp

Negative 11094 pEnvironment  Visual studio 2013  Framework 4.0, IE11, Oracle 11gp  pI have an ASP.NET TextBox with TextMode  TextBoxMode.MultiLine that is getting filled with data from Oracle. The same data is getting added to a ViewState variable as well, as I need to find a difference between the original database value and multiline textbox value when a page is posted back upon Save button click. p  pIf I am changing the value in the textbox, it should be different. However, the values are equated to be different even if I am not changing anything in the multiline textbox while saving it.p  pThe strange part is, this only occurs in IE11. Google chrome is finep  pIve tried converting both values to ASCII upon save button click and found that multiline textbox has extra carriage return ASCII value  13 for new line.p  pThe string in ViewState converts the new line to ASCII 10, whereas same string in Textbox converts the new line to ASCII 13Carriage return and ASCII 10new line feed.p  pMy solutions to this is to remove the extra 13carriage return from textbox while comparing it and saving it. p  pI just wanted to see if anyone else has ever encountered this problem, is there a .NET fix to it or I am doing something wrong which I doubt as its working fine in chromep  pThank you for your inputs.p

Negative 11094 pI am trying to write a verilog code for FPGA programming where I will implement a VGA application. I use Quartus II and Altera DE2. p  pAt the moment, my aim is to get a 640x480 rgb image during compilation method doesnt matter as long as it works and is efficient. The best solution I came up with is to convert the picture into rgb hex files using matlab and to use readmemh to get them into a register. p  pBut as discussed here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions30418362verilogreadmemhtakestoomuchtimefor50x50pixelrgbimageverilog readmemh takes too much time for 50x50 pixel rgb imageap  pit takes too much time and apparently there is no way around it with this method. It would be fine if it was only the time but there is also the size problem, 640x480 pretty much costs most of the free space. p  pWhat I am hoping is some system function or variable type of verilog that will take and store the picture in a different way so that size wont be a problem anymore. I have checked solutions for verilog and quartus webpage but I believe there should be a faster way to do this general task, rather than writing something from scratch.p  pcompilation report for 200x200 readmemh attempt img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comJWDoA.png alt200x200 compilation reportp
Negative 11094 pSo I have a glew project.  And I am trying to create something that is basically a lifebar that overlays everything.  My problem is I can not figure out how to draw it because my camera defined as GLFrame cameraFrame is moving and rotating to accommodate the players movements.  Also even if it didnt pay attention to the camera I worry it would intersect with other geometry on the level.  How can I do this in glew p  pI have considered trying to get it not to intersect by using p  precodeglPolygonOffset1.0f, 1.0f codepre  pbut it doesnt workp  pCurrently I am defining the life bar as two triangles.p  precodeGLBatch bar1 GLfloat vSquare[6][3]   bar1.BeginGLTRIANGLES, 6 bar1.CopyVertexData3fvSquare bar1.End codepre  pAnd it draws perfectly, except just like all the other level geometry it follows the perspective of the camera.

We use Google for authentication via Oauth.p  pThere have been a handful of days over the last couple of months on which we have been intermittently unable to authenticate users.p  pThe redirect to and from Google is successful, but when we try to call the codetokenendpointcode at a hrefhttpswww.googleapis.comoauth2v4tokenhttpswww.googleapis.comoauth2v4tokena to validate the authentication we sometimes get the following exception codejavax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException server certificate change is restrictedduring renegotiationcode.p  pThis comment on another question led me to find a JDK bug that can manifest as this exception a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions27105004whatmeansjavaxnetsslsslhandshakeexceptionservercertificatechangeisrecomment4735419327359749What means quotjavax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException server certificate change is restrictedduring renegotiationquot and how to prevent ita.p  pMy working hypothesis isp  pThe bug a hrefhttpsbugs.openjdk.java.netbrowseJDK8072385httpsbugs.openjdk.java.netbrowseJDK8072385a means that only the first entry in the Subject Alternative Name SAN list is checked. The exception above is thrown when the hostname being verified is in the SAN list, but not at the top of the list.p  pYesterday 27th May 2015 from  we saw two different certificates being intermittently served from www.googleapis.com. The first serial code671ad610cd1a06cccode had an SAN list of codeDNS.googleapis.com, DNS.clients6.google.com, DNS.cloudendpointsapis.com, DNScloudendpointsapis.com, DNSgoogleapis.comcode whilst the second serial code61dbc852b477cf78code had a SAN list of codeDNS.storage.googleapis.com, DNS.commondatastorage.googleapis.com, DNS.googleapis.comcode.p  pDue to the bug in the JVM, we can validate the first certificate, but the exception is thrown with the second despite being perfectly valid as code.googleapis.comcode is not the first entry in the SAN list.p  pThe fix is in the yet to be released 7u85 no mention of when this will be available.p  pIve downgraded a single node of our cluster to 7u65, but the certificate seemed to be reverted at around the time we did this last error we saw was 2220GMT so its hard to pin down an affirmative fix.p  pHas anyone else experienced this or something similar and have any other workaround other than downgrading downgrading removes various other SSLTLS checksp

Negative 11094 pI am making an language app that needs audio as well as visual translations.

If its bigger than 1M, take 500, see the size. If the payload is bigger, take the first 250 items. If the payload if smaller, take 750 items. And so on, you get the logic.

Negative 11094 pI have a C based dynamic library that I have built for the big 3 OSs that relies heavily on boost. Currently, I am compiling it for the raspberry pi. It took me a while to find the magic words to get the library to even build frepo as a compiler flag was the key, but I confess that I am not certain why this is the case.p  pNow, when I try to link to the library, I get an undefined reference error to every boost call that my library makes, i.e.p  precodelibmylib.so undeifined reference to boostsharedptrltboostdetailthreaddatabasegtsharedptr codepre  pWhen I build codelibmylib.socode, I also build a custom version of boost as codelibboost.acode. This all compiles and links fine on other OSs and nonARM architectures so I tried putting codelboostcode as one of the flags, but I still get the same plethora of undefined reference errors form codelibmylib.socode. p  pNeedless to say, all my paths are correct.p  pIt seems like linking behaves a bit differently on the raspberry pi than it does on other linux systems. For example, I built a static library codelibmythread.acode that uses codelibpthreadcode. When I link to that codelibmythread.acode, I also get undefined reference errors unless I also use codelpthreadcode in the build recipe. On my Thinkpad running Fedora, I would never have to do this since I included codelpthreadcode in the compilation of the static library codelibmythread.acode. p  pI would love to find a tutorial or guide that explains these discrepancies. I would also love to overcome themp  pI also tried the same build on a conventional linux machine and everything linked fine, no problem. At least I know that my build process is OK. This does open up the possibility, though, that the codefrepocode flag is doing something funny that I dont understand and that this could be the root of the problem. p

Negative 11094 pI have following situation. Lets say i receive list of string values. I have to assign those values to specific type properties in Model. Model examplep  precode    public int ID  get set      public DateTime Date  get set  codepre  pThere is no problem in type conversion as i get array of property types with System.reflection and use Convert.ChangeTypestring value, type. However, i cant assignt Convert.ChangeType results to model properties because it returns object not my desired type of value.

It would be perfect if i could use Type[0]Convert.ChangeType... but it is not possible in Cp

Negative 11094 pI am writing a small program to perform realtime ambient noise removal using PortAudio. To do some of the necessary calculations like Fourier transforms, I need to supply the sample data, but I also need to know exactly how many samples I am working with at a given time.p  pstrongHow can I determine the number of audio samples in a bufferstrongp  pWhen attempting to solve this myself, two variables seemed particularly relevant and useful, namely the sampling rate and the frames per buffer. When I attempted to calculate the number of samples using the sampling rate, I ran into the issue of miscalculating the time between each callback invocation.p  precodeint ambienceCallbackconst void  inputBuffer,             void  outputBuffer,             unsigned long framesPerBuffer,             const PaStreamCallbackTimeInfo  timeInfo,             PaStreamCallbackFlags statusFlags,             void  userData      const SAMPLE  in  const SAMPLE  inputBuffer     PaStreamParameters  inputParameters  PaStreamParameters  userData     PaTime time  timeInfogtinputBufferAdcTime     int sampleCount  time  callbackTime  PaGetDeviceInfoinputParametersgtdevicegtdefaultSampleRate     callbackTime  time      extraneous ...  codepre  pwhere codecallbackTimecode is a variable declared in the header file, and initialized upon starting the audio input stream.p  precode extraneous ... error  PaStartStreamstream callbackTime  PaGetStreamTimestream  extraneous ... codepre  pHowever, the calculated time would always be zero. As a result, I could not make my idea to simply multiply the sampling rate by the elapsed time work. The other variable, codeframesPerBuffercode seemed like it could be useful for calculating the sample count if I could find how many samples were in a frame but, I flat out could not manage do that.p  pAgain, how can I strongdetermine how many samples are in the bufferstrong As a disclaimer, I am new to audio programming. I am probably mixing up some terms or concepts, causing the more experienced to scratch their heads. I apologizep
Negative 11094 pI was wondering if it was possible to autoscroll a specific column of cells left to right in a gridview in asp.netc.p  pI have a gridview filled from a database, and theres a column that can have certain cells anywhere from 1 character up to 100 characters. all other columns are pretty close in length varying only 23 characters maximum. For this column right now, i have it doing thisp  precode        ltItemTemplategt            ltdiv style overflow autogt            ltaspLabel IDLabel7 runatserver Textlt Bind[QA Msg] gt Width100gtltaspLabelgt            ltdivgt         ltItemTemplategt codepre  pWhich is fine if somebody wants to view it themselves, but this is up on a display and both the database and this page are updated automatically, so automatically scrolling text in this column would be the best solution that I can think of. If anybody knows how I could do this, or has another solution wrapping pushes some of the lower rows off the screen so that doesnt work it would be appreciated.p  pThank youp  pEDIT clarifying my question, Currently these gridview cells down this column have scrollbars to manually scroll if necessary. I am looking for a way to make the text scroll through automatically on a loop possibly with javascript p

However, my database and my codevarcharcode columns are codeUTF8unicodecicode.

I did a little digging and found that it is running montavista. p  pI thought I would install screen and a few other helpful small programs. p  pWhen I try to install screen, it said that there was no C compiler in path.

For example clicking to Workout button increases players power based on gold and energy. To do that, my code checks players gold and energy. Then if both checks are passed, it increases players power.p  pMy current database structure is like this Tablesp  precode resources       ID,       Energy,       ...   inventory       ID,       Gold,       ...   attributes       ID,       Power,       ... codepre  pI have to prepare and execute 6 different PDO statements for Workout button. Three times to get information that I need from tables and three times to update tables. For some other buttons, it gets up to 8  9.p  pI heard that using more than 3 or 4 prepared statements in a code really strains the code. But I also heard that creating tables with so many columns strains the database. I really dont know what to do. Can anyone lead me to right directionp

Negative 11094 pFirst, let me list a few facts.p  ul liI use a database that exports reports to separate instances of Excel 2007 amp 32 bit Windowsli liFourteen of these reports need to be moved to the same workbook to create a reconciliation report for each organisation every month closer to 20 at year endli liThere are 30 organisations that this is done for each month.li liI have no control over how the database outputs the reports Im stuck with what Ive gotli ul  pUsing ForEachLoops answer in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2971473canvbareachacrossinstancesofexcelthis thread on Stack Overflowa I devised a VBA macro that can pull together the reports into one workbook which resides in the same instance as my macro Ill call this instance1 simply by using copy and paste. Using this loop in ForEachLoops code p  precodeFor Each myWorksheet In objApp.Workbooks1.Worksheets     Debug.Print       amp myWorksheet.Name     DoEvents Next codepre  pI store the details of a report into a type called SheetIDp  precodeType SheetID     wbName As String     wsName As String     Object As Object     App As Excel.Application End Type codepre  pSo when ForEachLoops code finishes, I have an array of type SheetID that contains all the relevant details of each report which I simply need to loop through to perform any actions.p  pActions my code performs include Copy the sheet from the instance it resides in Paste the sheet into a new sheet in a workbook in instance1 Delete the sheet that I just copied from If no more sheets exist in the Workbook I just copied from, then close the workbook if no more workbooks exist in the instance I just copied from then quit the instance.p  pSo far, so good.p  pOK, so heres my issue. It seems that Excel forgets which instance is instance1. This doesnt happen until I close instance1 for the first time after I run the macro. So I could open the workbook in the morning, leave it open and be able to use it and any other workbooks all day with no issues with how Excel operates.p  pHowever, once I close instance1 and try to use Excel again, it starts throwing up errors. If I open a document from another application such as Outlook, or Windows Explorer I get Excel encountered a problem and must restart. The problem with this is that when it restarts it goes into document recovery mode and so changes the status of the document I was trying to open.p  pFor instance, when you open an Excel attachment from an email within the preview window so without opening the email in its own window first Excel defaults to read only for that document. If you open the email first and launch the attachment, Excel opens it as readwrite. This is normal behaviour. In the scenario above though, when Excel crashes upon its first attempt to open the attachment and restarts and then opens the attachment, its not opening the readwrite copy i was trying to open. So I never get the document as readwrite. The same happens when I open a document from HP TRIM a document management system, Excel crashes and releases control of the file while it is restarting, the operating system reports the file is no longer in use to TRIM and TRIM checks it back in again. The only way to remedy this is to do a full system restart.p  pEDIT ADDITIONAL PARAGRAPH The reason why I am saying Excel seems to forget which instance is the original is because when instance1 opens normally, any addins install properly, I have access to my personal macro workbook, and so on. When the other instances are started by the Database exports, those resources are not present which is as I would expect as they are already being used by instance1. After Excel crashes, those resources behave as they do in the export instances even when there are no other instances running. In fact when I try and run a macro in my Personal Macro Workbook from a Quick Access Toolbar Button, Excel warns me that the PERSONAL.XLSB is already in use and do I want to open a readonly copy.p  pI suspect its something to do with objects not being killed properly but my understanding is that an object only exists as long as the original reference to it exists and so certainly shouldnt exist after instance1 is closed.p  pThis leads me to the functions that are declared at the top of ForEachLoops code.p  precodeDeclare Function FindWindowEx Lib User32 Alias FindWindowExA ByVal hWnd1 As Long, ByVal hWnd2 As Long, ByVal lpsz1 As String, ByVal lpsz2 As String As Long Declare Function GetClassName Lib User32 Alias GetClassNameA ByVal hWnd As Long, ByVal lpClassName As String, ByVal nMaxCount As Long As Long Declare Function IIDFromString Lib ole32 ByVal lpsz As Long, ByRef lpiid As UUID As Long Declare Function AccessibleObjectFromWindow Lib oleacc ByVal hWnd As Long, ByVal dwId As Long, ByRef riid As UUID, ByRef ppvObject As Object As Long codepre  pI really have no idea how they work or if theres any housekeeping my code should do when I quit instance1.p  pI would appreciate somebody analysing ForEachLoops code on the link above to see if they can spot any issues with it or give me some pointers as to how I should best handle this. I had a vaguely similar issue with an Excel addin I created that uses a XRibbonUI object occasionally excel would lose the pointer to the ribbon. This was solved by saving the ribbon pointer to a worksheet and then using CopyMemory to get it back into Excel once it was lost. Could something like this be used herep  pMany thanks to anyone who can help me with this.p
