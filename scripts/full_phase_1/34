Positive 34 pIs there a way to display a simple text based UI via shell scripting that isnt interspersed with the prompts amp etc in the main bash process Essentially I want something that acts like codemancode, only it displays something that isnt a manpage and waits for a user input to get back to whatever the bash process was displaying. Is there a way to do this just using an existing shell command or should I be doing this portion with a compiled languagep  pI know how I can get the user input and print stuff, but Im unsure how to display said separate ui like codemancode is doing.p

Positive 34 pdo you recommend the Mono for high performance Unixbased TCP socket server with thousands of concurrent connections p  pWe are investigating the Mono platform for our Unixbased master server TCP socket server which should be able to handle at least 10005000 persistent connections. It must run on Unix platform because our tech infrastucture is already built on this ecosystem and ready to use. Another big benefit is that our game client is build in Unity, so using the same technology for client and server looks very prospective for us. p  pI already found and tried a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comArticles83102CSocketAsyncEventArgsHighPerformanceSocketCod relnofollowhigh performance implementation using SocketAsyncEventArgsa on Ubuntu and the results are pretty cool. It was able to process 4000 messages per second with 1000 opened connections. There is also a hrefhttpsgithub.comkerryjiangSuperSocket relnofollowSocketServer frameworka which looks quiet interesting. p  pHowever, I am little bit sceptical about other possible drawbacksp  ol liNot sure if the Mono implementation of the SocketAsyncEventArgs is fully replacable to .NET implementation on Windows. Is it ready for production in the current state li liNot sure if this is still issue with last versions but I found many hate comments targeting Mono performance. Is Mono comparable to other highlevel languages like JavaC.NET in the question of performance li liYou know it looks like there is not many people which are going this server way with Mono. Also we want to focus primarily on business logic rather then polish and hack core server functionality. So, is it possible to rapidly prototype relatively stable framework around Mono or we will need to solve many hidden secrets and issues li liLooks like the future of Mono is in crossplatform mobile market not servers. we are looking forward to next few years li liThere is also competition which have also its pros and cons e.g. JavaNetty, Node.js and is better in some aspects. li ol

If it reaches the data segment, the collision occurs. If it occurs, there is no more space to allocate for main function. So, it gets segmentation fault error. So using the above program I experiment it. On that program, the address of global variable a is 0x804a014. Each time main is called, the local variable i gets declared. So, I  expect, before the segmentation fault, the address of i is nearly to address of a. But, both the address are very different. So whats here going on. p  pWhy the address of a and i is not in the same range at the time of segmentation fault error.  So, how to cross check whether the main reaches the stack size and gets overflowed p

Negative 34 pDoes anyone have experience using makefiles for Visual Studio C builds under VS 2005 as opposed to using the projectsolution setup.  For us, the way that the projectsolutions work is not intuitive and leads to configuruation explosion when you are trying to tweak builds with specific compile time flags.p  pUnder Unix, its pretty easy to set up a makefile that has its default options overridden by user settings or other configuration setting.  But doing these types of things seems difficult in Visual Studio.p  pBy way of example, we have a project that needs to get build for 3 different platforms.  Each platform might have several configurations for example debug, release, and several others.  One of my goals on a newly formed project is to have a solution that can have all platform build living together, which makes building and testing code changes easier since you arent having to open 3 different solutions just to test your code.  But visual studio will require 3  number of base configurations configurations.  i.e. PC Debug, X360 Debug, PS3 Debug, etc.p  pIt seems like a makefile solution is much better here.  Wrapped with some basic batchfiles or scripts, it would be easy to keep the configuration explotion to a minimum and only maintain a small set of files for all of the different builds that we have to do.p  pHowever, I have no experience with makefiles under visual studio and would like to know if others have experiences or issues that they can share.p  pThanks.p  ppost edited to mention that these are C buildsp
Negative 34 pIm running into a perplexing problem with an ActiveX control Im writing  sometimes, Internet Explorer appears to fail to properly unload the control on process shutdown. This results in the control instances destructor not being called.p  pThe control is written in C, uses ATL and its compiled using Visual Studio 2005. The control instances destructor is always called when the user browses away from the page the control is embedded in  the problem only occurs when the browser is closed. p  pWhen I run IE under a debugger, I dont see anything unusual  the debugger doesnt catch any exceptions, access violations or assertion failures, but the problem is still there  I can set a breakpoint in the controls destructor and its never hit when I close the broswer.p  pIn addition, when I load a simple HTML page that embeds multiple instances of the control I dont see the problem. The problem only appears to happen when the control is instantiated from our web application, which inserts  tags dynamically into the web page  of course, not knowing what causes this problem, I dont know whether this bit of information is relevant or not, but it does seem to indicate that this might be an IE problem, since its data dependent. p  pWhen I run the simple test case under the debugger, I can set a breakpoint in the controls destructor and its hit every time. I believe this rules out a problem with the control itself say, an error that would prevent the destructor from ever being called, like an interface leak.p  pI do most of my testing with IE 6, but Ive seen the problem occur on IE 7, as well. I havent tested IE 8.p  pMy working hypothesis right now is that theres something in the dynamic HTML code that causes the browser to leak an interface on the ActiveX control. So far, I havent been able to produce a good test case that reproduces this outside of the application, and the application is a bit too large to make a good test case.p  pI was hoping that someone might be able to provide insight into possible IE bugs that are known to cause this kind of behavior. The answer provided below, by the way, is too general  Im looking for a specific set of circumstances that is known to cause this. Surely someone out there has seen this before.p

Negative 34 pI have a C program that stores some object in java store using JNI. Before someone ask, using java store is a requirment here and I have to write a client in C which would be able to add and retrieve objects from this store.p  pI made the program and tried to add 100000 object of size 1KB. But after adding only 50000 objects I am getting out of memory messages please note that I am printing these out of memory messages whenever I am unable to allocate a new string or byte array using NewStringUTF and NewByteArray functions. At that time my application is using only 80MB of memory. I dont why these methods are returning NULL. Is there something I am missing.p  pFurthermore, the memory keeps on increasing even though I am releasing byte array and string created for java.p  pHere is the source code.p  precode    void createjvmvoid  JavaVMInitArgs vmargs JavaVMOption vmoptions  vmoptions.optionString  Djava.class.pathcStore vmargs.version  JNIVERSION14 vmargs.nOptions  1 vmargs.options  ampvmoptions vmargs.ignoreUnrecognized  0  JNICreateJavaVMampjvm, voidampenv, ampvmargs  ifenv  null  jstore  envgtFindClassenv, comstore ifjstore  null  printfunable to find class. class name JStore     void addchar key, char value, int length  jstring jkey  envgtNewStringUTFenv, key jbyteArray jvalue  envgtNewByteArrayenv, length  envgtSetByteArrayRegionenv, jvalue, 0, length, jbyte value ret  envgtCallStaticBooleanMethodenv, jstore, methodid, jkey, jvalue  ifjvalue  null  envgtReleaseByteArrayElementsenv, jvalue, jbyte value, 0  ifjkey  null  envgtReleaseStringUTFCharsenv, jkey, key   codepre  pThe java side recieves the data in byte[] and stores it in a hashtable. The issue is that everytime the code runs the memory only adds up and is never released. I tried to add 1 MB object and debugged it.p  pThe process memory increases by 1MB when I call NewByteArray. But when CallStaticBooleanMethod is called the process memory increase by 4MB. And the call to ReleaseByteArrayElements do not release any memory at all.p  pIf I add another 1MB object after this, then process memory remains same when I call NewByteArray and it increase by 1MB when I call CallStaticBooleanMethod but remains the same when I try to release the byte array.p
Negative 34 pI have a table and in one of the cells I keep a UITextView. When the user taps it the keyboard appears. I was trying various ways to get rid of it. My first approach was to detect a tap on the table cell of the UITextView, but since the text view takes most of it, its not suitable. Then I tried to add a button to the toolbar and whenever the user presses it, the keybord disappears with resignFirstResponder, but it wont work. It seems that only when Im in the same view as the UITextView resignFirstResponder works. So how can I get rid of the keyboard from a different view p  pThanks.p

I cant figure out how to add an active class to the currently clicked codeltligtcode while removing the active class from whatever button currently has it set. I dont know how to make jQuery figure out which of the other two codeltligtcodes has the active class set before the new button is pushed. How would I go about doing thatp  pAlso I am not sure if adding a class will solve the problem since I am already setting the zindex by targeting the codeltligtcodes id. Maybe I would need to affect the inline css for the currently pushed button so it overrides the ids css, and also have it check to see which of the other two has the inline css zindex set to 999 so it can remove their inline css and have a larger zindex than the other two buttons and appear on topp

Negative 34 pWeve recently started using complied queries in order to improve performance on our Linq to SQL setup.

I dont see any other way to do that other than just keep it true, so that means any other code I create below this loop wont happen.  I didnt make the while loop a different function because I was using those variables codei and jcode.p  pSo I dont see how I can refactor beyond this loop.  p  pSo my main question isp  pHow would I pass the values of codei and jcode to a new method animateBall and how would I use  codeball.movevx  vx, vy  vycode in that new method if ball has been declared in the buildBall methodp  pI understand this is probably a simple thing of better understanding variable scope and passing arguments, but Im not quite there yet...p

Negative 34 pI need help with finding my aggregate root and boundary. p  pI have 3 Entities Plan, PlannedRole and PlannedTraining. Each Plan can include many PlannedRoles and PlannedTrainings. p  pSolution 1 At first I thought Plan is the aggregate root because PlannedRole and PlannedTraining do not make sense out of the context of a Plan. They are always within a plan. Also, we have a business rule that says each Plan can have a maximum of 3 PlannedRoles and 5 PlannedTrainings. So I thought by nominating the Plan as the aggregate root, I can enforce this invariant. p  pHowever, we have a Search page where the user searches for Plans. The results shows a few properties of the Plan itself and none of its PlannedRoles or PlannedTrainings. I thought if I have to load the entire aggregate, it would have a lot of overhead. There are nearly 3000 plans and each may have a few children. Loading all these objects together and then ignoring PlannedRoles and PlannedTrainings in the search page doesnt make sense to me. p  pSolution 2 I just realized the user wants 2 more search pages where they can search for Planned Roles or Planned Trainings. That made me realize they are trying to access these objects independently and out of the context of Plan. So I thought I was wrong about my initial design and that is how I came up with this solution. So, I thought to have 3 aggregates here, 1 for each Entity. p  pThis approach enables me to search for each Entity independently and also resolves the performance issue in solution 1. However, using this approach I cannot enforce the invariant I mentioned earlier. p  pThere is also another invariant that states a Plan can be changed only if it is of a certain status. So, I shouldnt be able to add any PlannedRoles or PlannedTrainings to a Plan that is not in that status. Again, I cant enforce this invariant with the second approach. p  pAny advice would be greatly appreciated. p  pCheers, Moshp

Negative 34 pIm using Google appengine for developing an web application that is meant to be used on both the browser and iphone. I have purchased a domain name for this application, so that I have a pretty URL. Ive used the a hrefhttpcode.google.comappenginedocspythonusers relnofollowUser APIa for authentication. This works just fine on desktop browsers and iPhone Safari.p  pThe user could add the application to the home screen by tapping the  at the bottom toolbar. However when thats done, it seems like the cookies set by Google are not in effect within this application, and the user is effectively logged out. To make matters worse, when the user clicks on the login link as generated by GAE, the app closes and opens safari to complete the login. Since the session is apparently not shared between the two, the login process is futile, and the homescreen version of the app continues to be logged out.p  pIt seems that the cookies are not shared between a homescreen app and Safari. It also seems that the homescreen app will only work within its own domain, and any redirect to any other domain will open Safari. Any idea how I can go about fixing thisp

The challenge I am faced with this type of data is like a scenario of logging a market price change with date. The real problem in mycase is to select all rows with the beginning and ending date if both A amp B matches in all these rows. Also to select the rows which are next to previously selected, and so on like that no data is left out in the table.p  pI can explain a real world scenario. A Hotel with Room A and B has room rates for each day entered in to table as explained in my question. Now the hotel needs to get a report to show the price calendar in a shorter way using start and end date, instead of listing all the dates entered. For example, on 20100701 to 20100702 the price of A is 200 and B is 300. This price is changed from 3rd to 4th and on 5th there is a different price only for that day where the Room B is price is changed to 350. So this is considered as a single day difference, thats why start and end dates are same.p  pI hope this explained the scenario of the problem. Also note that this hotel may be closed for a specific time period, lets say this is an additional problem to my first question. The problem is what if the rate is not entered on specific dates, for example on Sundays the hotel do not sell these two rooms so they entered no price, meaning the row will not exist in the table.p

Negative 34 pI am currently looking into codemalloccode implementation under Windows.

But then there are other implementation of codemalloccode, for instance a hrefhttpwww.nedprod.comprogramsportablenedmallocnedmalloca, which claim to be up to 125 faster than Microsofts codemalloccode.p  pAll this makes me wonder a few thingsp  ol lipWhy cant we just call codeHeapAlloccode for small blocks Does is perform poorly in regard to fragmentation for example by doing firstfit instead of bestfitp  ul listrongActually, is there any way to know what is going under the hood of the various API allocation calls That would be quite helpful.strongli ulli lipWhat makes codenedmalloccode so much faster than Microsofts codemalloccodepli lipFrom the above, I got the impression that codeHeapAlloccodecodeVirtualAlloccode are so slow that it is much faster for codemalloccode to call them only once in a while and then to manage the allocated memory itself.

So from this point I want to get the strongWin32DiskDrivestrong for the strongWin32PnPEntitystrong.p  pAny input would be appreciated.p  p EXTRA INFORMATION TO BETTER DESCRIBE THE ISSUEp  pThe steps I have got working so far are as followsbr  Listen to the InstanceModificaitionEvent for the Win32USBControllerDevicebr  Get the Win32PnPEntity from the TargetInstnace of the InstanceModificaitionEventbr  Get the DeviceId from the Win32PnPEntity which contains the PID, VID information.  p  pThe issue I have now is trying to find the Win32LogicalDisk ANDOR Win32DiskDrive ANDOR Win32DiskPartition OR some other ASSOCIATOR or REFERENCES link to the drive letter the USB device attached has been assigned for the Mass Storge instance.  p  pThe best way I can think of the issue is described in the following diagram  p  precode           USB DEVICE                                      Win32DiskDrive        Win32PnPEntity   codepre  pWhat I am trying to do, is figure out how to get from the Win32PnPEntity representation of the USB Device to the Win32DiskDrive representation.  p  pFollowing is a powershell script I run, while the device is attached.  It gives me all the instances that belong to the USB Device.

When the user buys the application, they supply their name and email address.   The web site hashes the users name and email address, signs the hash with your private key, and provides the result in Base64 to ease typing.   When the user enters the code into your application along with their name and email address, your application can verify that it was signed by your private key which only youthe web store has access to, and that it matches the name and email provided by the user.p blockquote  pMy website runs on linux server so that the program generating the licence will be written in php.

I do not know what the default encoding is in this case. It appears that it is not UTF8.p  pOn the java side, httpServletRequest.getCharacterEncoding shows null.

A common solution consists in importing withp  precodefrom dumper import C   Objects of class C can be imported  with openobj.pickle, rb as f     obj  pickle.loadf codepre  pHowever, this solution has a few drawbacks, including the fact that all the classes referenced by the pickled objects have to be imported there can be many furthermore, the local namespace becomes polluted by names from the codedumper.pycode program.p  pNow, a solution to this consists of fully qualifying objects prior to picklingp  precode New dumper.py program import pickle import dumper   This is this very program  class Cobject     pass  with openobj.pickle, wb as f     pickle.dumpdumper.C, f   Fully qualified class codepre  pUnpickling with the original codeloader.pycode program above now works directly no need to do codefrom dumper import Ccode.p  pstrongQuestionstrong Now, other classes from codedumper.pycode seem to be automatically fully qualified upon pickling, and I would love to know how this works, and whether this is a reliable, documented behaviorp  precodeimport pickle import dumper   This is this very program  class Dobject   New class     pass  class Cobject     def initself         self.d  D   NOT fully qualified  with openobj.pickle, wb as f     pickle.dumpdumper.C, f   Fully qualified pickle class codepre  pNow, unpickling with the original codeloader.pycode program also works no need to do codefrom dumper import Ccode codeprint obj.dcode gives a emfully qualifiedem class, which I find surprisingp  precodeltdumper.D object at 0x122e130gt codepre  pThis behavior is very convenient, since only the top, pickled object has to be fully qualified with the module name codedumper.Ccode.  But is this behavior reliable and documented  how come that classes are pickled by name D but that the unpickling decides that the pickled codeself.dcode attribute is of class codedumper.Dcode and not some local  codeDcode classp  pstrongPS The question, refinedstrong I just noticed a few interesting details that might point to an answer to this questionp  pIn the pickling program codedumper.pycode, codeprint self.dcode prints codeltmain.D object at 0x2af450gtcode, with the first codedumper.pycode program the one without codeimport dumpercode.  On the other hand, doing codeimport dumpercode and creating the object with codedumper.Ccode in codedumper.pycode makes codeprint self.dcode print codeltdumper.D object at 0x2af450gtcode the codeself.dcode attribute is automatically qualified by Python  So, it appears that the codepicklecode module has no role in the nice unpickling behavior described above.p  pThe question is thus really why does Python convert codeDcode into the fully qualified codedumper.Dcode, in the second case  is this documented somewherep

However, I was genuinely suprised at the actual behaviour encountered and am interested in any answers to my questions.p  pHeres some VBA to reproduce the behaviour just copypaste into any VBA module, no references need to be set and Access need not be installed e.g. use Excels VBA editorp  precodeSub ColumnOrderWrong    On Error Resume Next   Kill Environtemp amp DropMe.mdb   On Error GoTo 0    Dim cat   Set cat  CreateObjectADOX.Catalog   With cat     .Create          ProviderMicrosoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0 amp          Data Source amp          Environtemp amp DropMe.mdb     With .ActiveConnection        Dim Sql As String       Sql         CREATE TABLE Orders amp vbCr amp         amp vbCr amp  ID INTEGER,  amp vbCr amp         customerid amp         INTEGER amp vbCr amp               .Execute Sql        Sql         INSERT INTO Orders ID, customerid VALUES amp         1, 2       .Execute Sql        Sql         SELECT ,  amp vbCr amp               IIFTRUE, 55, 99 AS calculatedcol amp vbCr amp          FROM Orders       Dim rs       Set rs  .ExecuteSql        MsgBox        Fields0.Name   amp rs.Fields0.Name amp vbCr amp        Fields1.Name   amp rs.Fields1.Name amp vbCr amp        Fields2.Name   amp rs.Fields2.Name      End With     Set .ActiveConnection  Nothing   End With End Sub codepre

Negative 34 pQuick disclaimer, this is a contrived example meant to simulate an issue I am seeing in my homework problem. To that end, using strings is out of the question I can only use char arrays as per the instructor p  pWhat I am trying to do is continuously read input from the keyboard and store it in a codevectorcode . The problem is, whatever data I add to the codevectorcode is lost as soon as the codeaddDatacode function ends when I try to view it, I see code320366277377code. I believe this is due to the fact I am using a codevectorltchargtcode, so the codevectorcode can only use the data for as long as the codepointercode exists. However, my code cannot compile if I change it to a codevectorltchargtcode, as I get errors saying codecannot convert char to charcode.p  pSo, how can I save a strongchar arraystrong emnotem a single char to a vector element Or, is there perhaps a better approach to this that would avoid the problem altogetherp  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltcstringgt include ltvectorgt  using namespace std const int MAXBUFFERSIZE  80   class declaration class Example  public     void getData      void addData  char  newData      void displayData   private     vectorltchargt vec    main function int main       bool quitProg     int quit     quitProg  false     Example shoopDaWhoop  buffers cannot overflow if you shoop da whoop     while quitProg          shoopDaWhoop.getData         shoopDaWhoop.displayData         cout ltlt Type 1 if you want to exit...          cin gtgt quit         if quit  1              quitProg  true                   return 0   void ExamplegetData       char userInput [MAXBUFFERSIZE]      cout ltlt Enter text      cin.getuserInput, MAXBUFFERSIZE  1, n     if  cin.fail    data is invalid          clear and reset input stream         cin.cleariosgoodbit         cin.ignoreINTMAX,n          alert user they entered bad data         cout ltlt That was bad data ltlt endl          else           data is good, pass it to addData         addData userInput         void ExampleaddData  char  newData       vec.pushbacknewData     cout ltlt You entered  ltlt vec.back ltlt endl    void ExampledisplayData       for int i0 iltvec.size i          cout ltlt Item  ltlt i ltlt   ltlt vec[i] ltlt endl      codepre  pp

But now is the problem whats the best way to save this data in Java Saving the distance inside the person classs members is not good, because the distance is not relevant to the person object. I thought about creating a two dimenesional array which holds the person in the first column and the data in the other. Another option I thought is to create a container object with two values, the person and the distance.p  pWhat do you think is the most efficient and object oriented way of doing thatp

Negative 34 pOk, so I am fairly new to php and mysql.  I am creating a php front end to mysql database.  I am using PDO driver to access the database, since it prevents sql injection attacks.  So far it has been fine until I came to this problem.  I have a search function where a user can type company name full or partial to search for data about it.p  pHere is PDO statement I am using to carry out the search in databasep  precodeSELECT CompName FROM CompanyName  WHERE CompName REGEXP name  ORDER BY CompName ASC LIMIT 1 codepre  pSo then I can prepare, bind what user types in search field to parameter name and execute the statement.  As long as user does not type any metacharacters it works.  Here is the very basic regular expression I insert into the PDO statement instead of namebr whatusertyped since originally I am looking for a complete match.  Since some company names do contain periods and such I want to be able user to type those characters and my regular expression to take them as literals as opposed to metacharacters.  So far this is how I have been replacing metacharacters to get their literal meaningp  puser types   C.    to look for company name that starts with C.p  pphp function inserts  and   to get  an output of C.p  pmysql gets  C.  and searches for C. in the beginning of company name  where period is literal and not meant to say look for wild card character.  p  pSo I am trying for C. because there is a company in the database whose name starts like that and I should get a match, but I dont,  the PDO statement returns back an empty array.p  pI did try the queryp  precodeSELECT CompName FROM CompanyName  WHERE CompName REGEXP C.  ORDER BY CompName ASC LIMIT 1 codepre  pdirectly in mysql and got back a match and I also directly executed the query in PHP without prepare, bind and got back a match.  The problem seems to me is in preparing and binding the search term to a parameter, but I have not been able to figure out what it is exactly and how to solve it.  I really want to use bind and prepare like I said to avoid sql injection.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.  Hopefully I explained the problem clearly.p

Negative 34 pI am looking at alternatives to a deep search algorithm that Ive been working on. My code is a bit too long to post here, but Ive written a simplified version that captures the important aspects. First, Ive created an object that Ill call BranchNode that holds a few values as well as an array of other BranchNode objects.p  precodeclass BranchNode  IComparableltBranchNodegt      public BranchNodeint depth, int parentValue, Random rnd              nodeDelta  rnd.Next100, 100         depth  depth  1         leafValue  parentValue  nodeDelta          if depth lt 10                      int children  rnd.Next1, 10             branchNodes  new BranchNode[children]             for int i  0 i lt children i                              branchNodes[i]  new BranchNodedepth, leafValue, rnd                                 public int CompareToBranchNode other              return other.leafValue.CompareTothis.leafValue            private int nodeDelta     public BranchNode[] branchNodes     private int depth     public int leafValue    codepre  pIn my actual program, Im getting my data from elsewhere... but for this example, Im just passing an instance of a Random object down the line that Im using to generate values for each BranchNode... Im also manually creating a depth of 10, whereas my actual data will have any number of generations.p  pAs a quick explanation of my goals, nodeDelta contains a value that is assigned to each BranchNode. Each instance also maintains a leafValue that is equal to current BranchNodes nodeDelta summed with the nodeDeltas of all of its ancestors. I am trying to find the largest leafValue of a BranchNode with no children.p  pCurrently, I am recursively transversing the heirarchy searching for BranchNodes whose child BranchNodes array is null a.k.a a childless BranchNode, then comparing its leafValue to that of the current highest leafValue. If its larger, it becomes the benchmark and the search continues until its looked at all BranchNodes.p  pI can post my recursive search algorithm if itd help, but its pretty standard, and is working fine. My issue is, as expected, that for larger heirarchies, my algorithm takes a long while to transverse the entier structure.p  pI was wondering if I had any other options that I could look into that may yield faster results... specificaly, Ive been trying to wrap my head around linq, but Im not even sure that it is built to do what Im looking for, or if itd be any faster. Are there other things that I should be looking into as wellp

Negative 34 pAnother cry for help about this warning.p  pFirst of all I have looked at every and all questions on here elsewhere and none seem to fit my situation.  It has nothing to do with Alert boxes and resigning as first responder, nor performing any animation before views get displayed.  My problem occurs when instantiating a UIView based custom keyboard.p  pSecondly, I believe that I can make the warning appeardisappear at will.  I am just very confused as to why, so I am looking more for an explanation than a solution. p  pThere is too much code to post here, so Ill just give an outline of what is going onp  blockquote   pThe ViewController Calc instantiates a custom UIView based DataView in the VCs loadView method, and then adds it as a sub view of the VC.p      pThe DataView instantiates a custom UITextField based TextFieldKPD in the DataViews init methodp      pThe TextField instantiates a custom UIView based KeyPad in the TextFields init method, and assigns that KeyPad to the TextFields inputView.p      pThe KeyPad creates 13 UIButtons of type UIButtonTypeCustom, reads in and assigns a pressed and not pressed image for each button, as well as setting actions for the buttons.  It then adds each button as a subview of itself.  By controlling when in the UIView lifecycle  of the KeyPad that this construction occurs, is how I can effect the waitfences warning see below.p blockquote  pThe Calc ViewController is the one that is initially presented to the user. I have tracked down the waitfences warning as occurring after the end of the Calcs viewDidLayoutSubViews method and before its viewDidAppear method is called.  Note that the KeyPad is not visible when the Calc is displayed.p  pI appear to be able to control the action of the waitfences warning by changing how the Keypad is constructedp  ul lipIf the UIButtons are instantiated and added as subviews in the init method of the KeyPad, then I will get the warning, once and once only.pli lipIf, instead, the buttons are instantiated and added in the KeyPads layoutSubViews method, then the warning does not appear.  But the KeyPad doesnt effectively get constructed until I tap on the TextField  still, no waitfences warning then eitherpli ul  pThere is no animation or anything in Calcs loadView.  It is instantiate and assign all the way down.p  pSo any comments on this version of waitfences  p  pstrongEDIT 1, Jan 30th  Now With Even More Confusionstrongp  pI was bored this morning so I decided to play with my code to see if I could better isolate the generation of the warning. I narrowed it down to the following, totally useless code that with which I can now trigger the warningp  precodevoidloadImages      UIImage image      forint i0 ilt16 i          image  [UIImage imageNamedStupidFileNameThatDoesNotExist]       codepre  pIf I perform code[self loadImages]code in the init method of codeKeyPadcode then the warning appears.  But this code does nothing as the file does not exist.  I believe that if the loop counter is small enough that the warning does go away, but I havent qualified a lower limit. p  pIf I replace the actual loading of the image with p  pcode[UIImage imageWithContentsOfFileStupidFileNameThatDoesNotExist]code p  pand still call the method during the codeKeyPadcode init, then I do not seem to get the warning.  One obvious difference between these two ways of loading the image is that codeimageNamedcode caches the image internally.p  pSo I am leaning towards Georges answer that it is an internal Apple screw up. p  pstrongEdit 2, Feb 1  Its a warning Jim, but not as we know itstrongp  pSo I convinced myself that it was the caching in the UIImage class that was obviously causing the issue.  What to do about it  Well write my own image cache of coursep  pSo I started plugging away, rip out that code that attempted to load invalid images and got the point where I generated the file names I needed and passed them to my cache controller.  So to verify that things were starting to come together, within the cache controller, I generated a NSLog message for each attempt to cache an image  nothing more  just log the file name.p  pAnd guess what  I get the stupid warning again.  For doing no actual work at all.p  pI can only conclude that there is some sort of internal iOS race condition that I am triggering when I cram extra code into the init method of codeKeyPadcode.  And that there is nothing I can do to mitigate it.  All I can do is hope that this warning is benign.p  pstrongEdit 3, Hamlet Act 1 scene 4 Something is rotten in the state of Denmarkstrongp  pKeeping the same code as in Edit 2, I commented out the NSLog statement.  And the warning went away.  I put it back, and the warning appears.p  pSo the code I have isp  precodevoidloadImages       Iterate over button definitions and cache the required images     forint i0 iltnumKeys i           if [imageCache imageExistsForTagkeyTags[i]]              [imageCache addImageFile[NSString stringWithFormatsNP.png,keyNames[i]] forTagkeyTags[i]]                   if [imageCache imageExistsForTagkeyTags[i]pressedOffset]              [imageCache addImageFile[NSString stringWithFormatsP.png,keyNames[i]] forTagkeyTags[i]pressedOffset]                  codepre  pAndp  precodevoidaddImageFileNSStringimageFile forTaginttag      NSLogAdding tagd for file , tag, imageFile  codepre  pWith that NSLog statement controlling the appearance of the warning.p  pstrongEdit 4, Feb 2  Welcome to the Temple of Doomstrongp  pTaking Allens comments to heart I rebuilt my keyboard as a XIB and loaded that instead of manually trying to build the view.  Of course that didnt fix anything.  I had hoped that the Nib loading would happen outside of what ever it is that is causing the problem.p  pMy gut feeling is that I am butting up against a race condition within the loadView of Calc and some internal iOS activity.  If I do too much work inside loadView then I cross the line  and trip a waitfences warning.  And that the keyboard is a symptom and not the underlying cause.  IE it could have been any activity, it was just that the keyboard work was the last thing I did before the warning started appearing.  I just wish that I actually knew what the constraints were that I was actually crossing and not stumbling around in the dark.p
Negative 34 pI have a question about some foundational designing of coredata to make it future proof for my appp  pHeres the scenario, lets consider im developing a coredata model to track Body mass index, BMI, which is just one example and it will be listed in an entity named Category.p  pCategory has the following attributesp  ul liNSStringStringTitle       Weightli liNSNumberfloat upperMax    100 li liNSNumberfloat lowerMax    40  li ul  pNote Those upper and lower limits are completely hypothetical and have no scientific basis at all, im just using it for my example ahem..p  pAnother Entity  Trackerp  ul liNSDate timeStampli liNSNumber entryli ul  ptomany relationship exists here  codeCategoryltgtgtTrackercode.p  pUptil here, everything is well understood. The user enters inserts the tracker with the timeStamp and enters the valuecurrent recorded weight, the application then compares if its above or below or betweennormal the preset values in category.p  pWhat If I add another category  Body mass index BMI. BMI compares weight to height.p  pI can easily add them as a new cateogry in Entity asp  ul liName BMIli liUpperMax 23.5li liLowerMax 18.5li ul  pand user will add the track entries that compares the two.p  pBut I want to be able to add weight AND height and not the BMI index it self, this creates a scenario where the user will enter values to two textfields.p  pthe most obvious answer was to add another entry in Category called Height, but then Id have to create a new one to relate that with BMI.p  pInstead, im wondering about a new approach to design the cateogory entity in such a way that the Entry values can be user specified.  eg.  the Weight in Weight  required textfield input is ONE eg2. weight and height in BMI  required textfield input is TWO.p  pMaybe i should create a new entity with the name fields and store the category and specify the normal values number of required fields in this new entity.p  pIts pretty vague right now hope you get the idea of what im asking.p  pFROM A users perspective I want to be able to add customised categories in the app at runtime itself. Like in creating a new category, Ill add the Name and Add fields to the category using add button in the tableView.p  pIn BMI, Ill add two fields Name  1Weight UpperMaxLowerMax etc. 2Height etc..p  pThen when I tap new Entrys to track growth Two textFields should appear based on the count of Category.fields relationship.p  pIs this the right approach and how should i be connecting the Category entity with the Entry entity.

Negative 34 pI have a web application that has a phase listener. When the phase listener runs, it does a few things with the session map. Randomly usually not the firs request, but more frequently when requests are issued quickly I am getting a null pointer exception from SessionMap.put. After a bit of digging it appeared that when SessionMap.put was getting the session, it was getting back a null pointer even though it calls getSessiontrue. So I did a bit of debugging and discovered that indeed getSession and getRequestedSessionId are both returning null when invoked. However, if you check the cookies in the request request.getCookies the JSESSIONID cookie is included in the request and has the correct session. There doesnt seem to be rhyme or reason as to why the session and the requested session id some times comes back normal and sometimes comes back null. The only other piece of information that might be relevant here is that the JSF pages are living within the same application that some older JSPServlets are living in.p  pIve looked around online and others have said setting the cookie path to  has solved similar issues for them, but it doesnt appear to solve the issue here.p

Negative 34 pI wrote a simple alarmclock style application that I run on my jailbroken Nook Simple Touch aka NST, under Android 2.1.p  pWhen the scheduled alarm time arrives, my application needs to wake up the NST and display a page of HTML content.  I use AlarmManager to get a callback at the right time, and it seems to work as expected  almost.p  pThe problem occurs when enough idle time has passed that the NST has activated its lockscreen mode i.e. it is autodisplaying a caricature of a famous author.  I cant find a programmatic way to dismiss the lockscreen so that my HTML content will be visible.  I can see that my alarm callback routine ran at the expected time via the LogCat view in Eclipse, after I reconnect to the NST with adb, and after I manually drag to unlock with my finger, I can see that my apps window updated as expected, but I need to have the text become visible when the alarm event occurs, not just after the user unlocks the device.  I tried the code shown below based on other StackOverflow answers but it doesnt help.p  pAny ideas regarding a way to do this  One solution that technically works is to keep FLAGKEEPSCREENON set on my window at all times, so that the famousauthorlockscreen never appears in the first place, but that keeps the NST awake and therefore it uses up the battery rather quickly, so I want to avoid that if possiblep  precodeprivate void wakeUpTheScreen      Window win  getWindow     win.addFlagsWindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAGSHOWWHENLOCKED  WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAGDISMISSKEYGUARD     win.addFlagsWindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAGKEEPSCREENON  WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAGTURNSCREENON  codepre

Negative 34 pWe just set up a whole bunch of development MacBooks in our office.  We all set up the computers exactly the same as far as I can tell just installing xcode and not changing any settings.  We even distributed the exact same xcode project to everyone to test whether or not everyone was set up correctly.  For some reason though, my iPad simulator incorrectly renders the positions of Objects on the UIView controller. I can make a really basic application and slap down a UIView controller with the storyboard editor in xcode 4.3.1 newest version ATM, and add a button to it.  When I run this on the simulator, it will look fine on the iPhone one, but when I try to view it in the iPad, it seems that some elements will scale to the iPad resolution fine, but others will not.  The components that do not, seem to be in the place that they would be if they had been rendered on the iPhone. The weirdest part of this problem is that I cant find anyone online who has had this same issue.  I have already tried deleting and reinstalling xcode and the same thing still happens.

Negative 34 pI have a content provider which can query multiple other content providers via content resolver, and does some merging of contact data. p  pBasically I have extended asyncTask and handle the the data. In my main UI thread I do the followingp  precodecancelAllExistingTask  proiverTest1  new ProviderTaskgetActivity, MyActivity.this.callBack.executeSearchString, elementId1 proiverTest2  new ProviderTaskgetActivity, MyActivity.this.callBack.executeSearchString, elementId2 proiverTest3  new ProviderTaskgetActivity, MyActivity.this.callBack.executeSearchString, elementId3 proiverTest4  new ProviderTaskgetActivity, MyActivity.this.callBack.executeSearchString, elementId4 codepre  pSo I create 4 instances of my ProviderTask, as part of the ProviderTask constructor, I pass in an interface which is implemented in my instance of callBack class. p  precodeclass CallBackClass implements MyCallBackIF codepre  pThe ProviderTask during doInBackground fires off a ContentResolver.query to ONE provider. The same provider is used by all 4 Tasks. But based on the elementId it is returned to the interface via onPostExecute w the elementId of the cursor array it should be placed into see  below.p  pThe contentProvider parses the URI that is passed in, and based on the URI goes and queries 1 other ContentProvider for data. This could be local data, or remote from a server. Then depending on the source, it may merge it with other data local, and provide back a new cursor w merged data. The individual Content Provider  Content Resolver  Content Provider  Content Resolver is quite fast. And somewhat useful for providing search aggregation across a few different apps we have have. The provider does actually spawn an asyncTask to load the remote content provider data, and there is a synchronized block that waits on it to finish returning data before itself returning to the Activity. Part of the reason for this is that I could pass in a uri that has multiple providers to search amp merge where it fires off more than one content resolver query into its own Merge Cursor. But right now it is a Merge Cursor w 1 element that does run on an Async Task. p  p What I am doing is using a merge cursor amp Cursor[] to update a list view based on the merged data from the various different providers. You may be asking, why not allow the content provider just do that work for us We tried. It did not seem to work for us, but open to suggestions.p  pSo as it stands if our MergeProvider Queries  ContentProvider1, ContentProvider2, ContentProvider3, ContentProvider4 and say ContentProvider3 also has to query ContentProvider 1 to merge some data. ContentProvider 3 amp 4 are remote server basedp  pW a predictive search we want search results that return back fastest to show up first. And the others to trickle in as they come back, if a new letter is typed, we want to dump the entire result set, and wait for a new query.. This is what is happening, and it seems like we are being blocked somewhere we have tried upping thread priority of the AsyncTask, we have ExecuteExecutor w our own Executor amp pool upping the async task max of 10 to 100 w no results.p  pSo someone types in a letter  a  Content Provider 1, and Content Provider 2, return in say 0.050 seconds. Content Provider 4 returns in say 0.100 seconds. And Content Provider 3 returns in 5.00 seconds. The 5.00 delay is related to a test server we are testing on, but it has exposed the problem we are seeing w blocking.p  pnow if they continue to type, and the string shows albert It may have fired off a new AsyncTask for al which some return quickly, and others do not.. Say the Provider 3 is still waiting on a response.. Our code discards results if the predictive search has changed by the time the results come back. which is fine.  so then it fires off another round of AsyncTasks albert. Now remember Provider 3 is still off in its 5 second response. p  pWe added some logging in both the AsyncTask and in the Calling method handler.  What we are seeing is the AsyncTask getting created, but we are not seeing doInBackground get started until SearchProvider3 returns results and they are discarded. I am quite confused as to why this is happening. But it is basically blocking other AsyncTask objects. Not sure what would cause doInBackground to not be called until another AsyncTask came back unless it was because of the max limit of 10 AsyncTasks W our own implementation of ThreadPoolExecutor and even creating two different instances of ThreadPoolExecutor, we still see the same issue. p  pIt is VERY visible if in the query method of our Provider 3, we add a thread.sleep60000. Basically it looks like maybe 5 Async tasks get called before they start blocking. Our goal was to get local matching results back faster independent of other long running tasks. This would be more apparent on a slow 3g network.p  pMaybe we should not be using Async tasks for this, and just using runnables p  pThanks.p

Negative 34 pNot really sure how to phrase my question but heres my issuep  pI have a php template type site where the main navigation is in its own file.  Some of the navigation buttons point to anchors on the main page and some go to other pages completely. p  pMy original menu used links like index.php for the on page anchors and index.phppage for the off page links.  I had two issues with this 1. When I selected an on page link the page seemed to refresh and it was slow taking me to the place on the page the link was connected to. 2. Im using htaccess to redirect my url from mydomaincomindex.php to mydomaincom and found that my nav didnt work in Safari since my href addresses where index.phpvalue and Safari v5 wouldnt carry over the anchor links. p  pRather than turn off my redirect I just changed the urls to point to mydomaincomvalue. Not only did this work great for all browsers but it also made my page quicker.p  pNow however when Im on one of the other pages say index.phppagephotos and I use the nav it just tries to find the anchors on that page which makes sense but obviously not what I want. What its doing now   mydomaincomindex.phppagephotosp  pWhat I need it to do   mydomaincomp  pSince the same nav file is used for all pages do I need to create a nave link variable so that when the nav is on a nonindex.php page the link urls that hook to the index.php on page anchors uses the full url  p  pHopefully this makes sense.  Any suggestions  Also trying to keep this search engineGoogle friendly p  pThanksp

Negative 34 pIm trying to develop a SQL query to help me extract some data from my ASP.NET based website. Im working on a SQL compact database sdf on my ASP.NET based website using WebMatrix.p  pIm trying to implement a code in my website to do monthly spring cleaning of the database. I need to delete those accounts which were created by the user but never activated. So to free up the user IDs and manage database size, I thought Id run a query on the database to get me those accounts which have not been confirmed by the user yet and their creation date has passed 20 days.p  pThe database structure is that my users table is called Users. It has a UserID autonumber, Email, FullName, etc. fields.p  pThe table created by ASPs WebSecurity is called webpagesMembership. It has UserID autonumber, CreationDate, IsConfirmed whether account has been activated, etc. fields.p  pIm not good at developing SQL queries. The problem Im facing is that when a user is deleted using the Membership.DeleteUser method with argument set to DeleteAllRecords, it deletes the relevant users row in my Users table, whereas it does nothing in its own table webpagesMembership. When a user tries to signin, it simply checks if the Email the userid exists in my Users table. So in the long run, there are accounts appearing in webpagesMembership which do not exist in Users table because they were deleted. People who are familiar with the behavior of WbeSecurity mustve experienced all this above. p  pThats it for the database background.p  pIm trying to develop a query that will lookup the webpagesMembership table, get me those rows which have IsConfirmed field set to False meaning those accounts not activated yet, and ensure that the UserID field in webpagesMembership also exists in Users table this will ensure account is not previously deleted.p  pNeed assistance on that. Shouldnt be too hard for query veterans p  pThanks in advance Farazp

I ran some sample examples and found it easy to use because of my previous experience with qml.p  pCan someone share experience how empowerfulem it is compared to OpenGl itselfp  pMy basic question is how emlowem the drawing requirements should be that I should use OpenGl rather than some higher abstraction like QtOpenGl p
Negative 34 pPython optparse normally allows the user to specify an option more than once and silently ignores all occurrences of the option but the last one. For example, if the action of option codefoocode is codestorecode and the action of option codeflagcode is  codestoreconstcode, codestoretruecode or codestorefalsecode, the following commands will be equivalentp  precodemycommand foobar fooanother flag foolast flag mycommand flag foolast codepre  pUpdate argparse does just the same thing by default.p  pNow, I have a lot of options, and specifying any of them more than once doesnt make sense. If a user specifies the same option more than once Id like to warn them about the possible error.p  pWhat is the most elegant way to detect options that were specified multiple times Note that the same option can have a short form, a long form and abbreviated long forms so that codefcode, codefoobarcode, codefoobcode and codefoocode are all the same option. It would be even better if it was possible to detect the case when multiple options that have the same emdestinationem were specified simultaneously, so that a warning can be given if a user specifies both codequietcode and codeverbosecode while both options store a value into the same destination and effectively override each other.p  pUpdate To be more userfriendly, the warning should refer to the exact option names as used on the command line. Using codeappendcode actions instead of codestorecode is possible, but when we detect a conflict, we cannot say which options caused it was it codeqcode and codeverbosecode or codequiet quietcode.p  pUnfortunately Im stuck with optparse and cannot use argparse because I have to support Python 2.6.p  pP. S. If you know of a solution that works only with argparse, please post it, too. While I try to minimize the number of external dependencies, using argparse under Python 2.6 is still an option.p

Negative 34 pWe just implemented a new job on a medium traffic database involved in transactional replication, that will process inputs from an Excel spreadsheet and call a stored procedure to create records within various tables in that DB.  p  pOne of the fields involved is a text data type that can range from 10k30k characters. Within the job, a custom SQL server function parses out a URL from the large HTML body and writes it to a table.  p  pDue to the intensive nature, or what seems to be that of the process, we only process 35 records or rows from the spreadsheet per job execution every half hour. What we are seeing is that the transaction log is growing at an alarming rate and is thus causing considerable latency from the publisher to the subscriber because the log reader agent scans the entire transaction log and finds 0 records for replication.  p  pTo put it into perspective, the log sits around 30GB in size, and cannot be much smaller because running the job 56 times will grow it past that size. We are doing frequent backups of the distribution database every 5 minutes and the transaction log every 15.  p  pWe are in dire need of a solution where we can decrease the latency, or decrease the amount of reading IO from the log. I realize that there could be work that needs to be done on the appjob side, but is there anything within the replication configuration that can be done to help with this latency and wasted scanning from the log  p  pAny help would be much appreciated.  Thank you.p

Not very efficient, but it works.p  pIve tried clearing the stackpanels children, and making the images in the array null, but Im still getting the IOException telling me that the file is being used by another process.p  pIs there some other way to remove the file from my applications processesp

Negative 34 pI am new to Django and I have an application that has 60,000 project models in the database. p  pThis amount is always going to be growing, project is a Django model that we made.  Our application routinely needs to display these projects on our site in a certain order.  We have 3 types of projects, I will call them type1, type2, type3.  Theses projects also expire at a certain time and the amount is always growing so we cannot create a static list and use that, it has to be dynamic.  We need to display the projects like32 per pagep  precodetype1 type2 type3 type1 type2 type3 type1 type2  type3 type1 type2 type3 type1 type2 type3 type1 type2 type3 type1 type2 type3 type1 type2 type3 type1 type2 type3 type1 type2 type3 type1 type2  codepre  pWe also have implemented infinite scroll to display these projects so the list needs to keep going in the same order. In example page 2 from above would start with type3.p  ol liRight now we make 3 queries by each type.li liCreate a list of each.li liCreate another list.  li liThen iterate through and append the projects in alternating order onto the list in 3.li liCreate a Paginator and return the specific page.li ol  pI understand that this is VERY expensive, creating all of these list and iterating through them but I am struggling with a way to speed it up.  One way I have tried is a hrefhttpmemcached.org relnofollowMemcacheda, p  pI store 1500 of the projects in Memcached and the response is very fast.  But when the key expires the application has to go through all of that again.  One thing I have thought of is to create a management commanda hrefhttpsdocs.djangoproject.comendevhowtocustommanagementcommands relnofollowhttpsdocs.djangoproject.comendevhowtocustommanagementcommandsa and run it from crontrab to ensure this list is always in memory.  We already run some commands in crontabour data pulls so this wouldnt be awful.p  pI also have tried taking advantage of the fact that you can use filter to create a QuerySet and it does not go to the database until it actually needs to.  But since we display 32 projects per page I am running into trouble with actually implementing this.  This is because it will display 10 of one type, 11 of another and 11 of another.  p  pThe amount of the different types is not the same. There is aboutp  blockquote   ptype1 500br   type2 36,000br   type3 24,000brp blockquote  pBecause of this I ran into trouble about what to do when type1 ended and also when type2 endedvery unlikely someone would get this far but still need to account for it. p  pEDIT Thank you for the responses This is for my school capstone project.

Then iterating through and creating the projects list takes a while as well.p  pBefore our capstone client wanted the types alternating we were just returning likep  precodedef indexrequest      projects  projects.objects.all      paginator  Paginatorprojects, 32      page  request.GET.getpage, 1     rendertoresponsefake.html, projectspaginator.pagepage, RequestContextrequest codepre  pThese are simplified versions of this function just to demonstrate the concept.

The alternating way takes entirely way too long because everything is loaded into memory and then iterated through.p  pThis is the version that I tried to do to take advantage of Django QuerySet lazy evaluationp  precodedef indexrequest      type1Projects  project.objects.filtertypetype1     type2Projects  project.objects.filtertypetype2     type3Projects  project.objects.filtertypetype3      page  request.GET.getpage, 1      type1Pag  Paginatortype1Projects, 11     type2Pag  Paginatortype2Projects, 11     type3Pag  Paginatortype3Projects, 11      type1List  listtype1Pag.pagepage     type2List  listtype2Pag.pagepage     type3List  listtype3Pag.pagepage      projects  list      whilelentype1List gt 0 or lentype2List gt 0 or lentype3List gt 0          iflentype1List gt 0              projects.appendtype1List.pop0         iflentype1List gt 0              projects.appendtype2List.pop0         iflentype3List gt 0              projects.appendtype3List.pop0       rendertoresponsefake.html, projectsprojects, RequestContextrequest codepre  pThis version does work a lot faster and this is  a simpler version then was actually implemented because there was logic to tell which project type to start with and to limit it to 32 projects per page.  But then it misses 1 type of project per page.  Once you get to the farther pages I was struggling to implement the logic to start on say project 5 in the list of this type then go to the next page.p  pI hope this clarifies a little bit, sorry it was confusing last night...I am getting ready for finals and was tiredprobably not thinking straight last night.  I will look into raw SQL and NoSql.  p  pSaransh Mohapatra What exactly do you mean using Redis or Memcache directly  We use Memcache now to store the first 1500 projects from the list.  The problem is that we only want our key to be valid for 510 minutes.  So when the key expires and then someone goes to the site the response is slow for them.  That is why I was talking about creating a management command and then running it say every 4 minutes using crontab and letting the key be valid for 10 minutes.  If we did this then the list would always be in there but I am not sure this is the best way to go about this.  p

Obviously, the Susy Sass mixins and includes depend on Compass, so I extracted the Compass Sass definitions from the Compass distribution, and put them where they could be accessed by Susy. I then tried to compile my stylesheets withp  psass I scsscompass scssfoobar.scss CSSDIRfoobar.cssp  pWhen I do this, Susy throws a warning You need to provide either a valid layout number of columns or a valid mediaquery minwidth breakpoint length.p  pDigging into the code, it appears that the issue is that Susy calls the compact function provided by Compass. The actual call is something likep  pcompactfalse,false,false,...p  pwhich  I presume  should evaluate top  pfalsep  pBut compact isnt a Sass feature its a Compass function, implemented in Ruby as part of Compass. If Compasss Ruby extensions arent available, that call is left unchanged, so the Susy mixin is getting handedp  pcompactfalse,false,false,...p  pwhich is not false ... and so things go pearshaped. The trouble happens at line 93 of susygrid.scss.p  pIt looks to me as if using Susy without Compass is not actually possible. Whats my best solution to this issue Do I just use compass compile ... instead of sass to compile my stylesheet Or can I somehow provide the compact function to sass in some other wayp
Negative 34 pI am just starting with MOAI and I am trying to create a traditional game loop using MOAICoroutine. The problem is that when I pass it the function that is part of a class that is built using 30log, it returns an error. It seems to continue to function, but I would like to fix the error. My guess is that the MOAICoroutine is calling the function using the dot notation rather than the syntactical sugar method with a colon. Here is the codep  precodeclass  require 30log.30log GameSystem  class   function GameSysteminitName, Title   self.Name  Name   self.Title  Title   self.Ready  false end  function GameSystemRun   if selfInit then     self.Thread  MOAICoroutine.new      self.Threadrunself.Start     selfStart     return true   else     printInit failed.     return false       end end  function GameSystemInit   printInitializing Game System   if not selfInitTimer then return false end   if not selfInitWindow640,480 then return false end   if not selfInitViewport then return false end   if not selfInitGraphics then return false end   if not selfInitSound then return false end   if not selfInitInput then return false end   self.Ready  true   return true end  function GameSystemStart   printStarting Game System   while self.Ready do     selfUpdateTimer     selfUpdateGraphics     selfUpdateSound     selfUpdateInput     coroutine.yield   end end  function GameSystemInitTimer   return true end  function GameSystemInitWindowwidth, height   printInitializing Window    return true end  function GameSystemInitViewport   printInitializing Viewport    return true end  function GameSystemInitGraphics   printInitializing Graphics   return true end  function GameSystemInitSound   printInitializing Sound   return true end  function GameSystemInitInput     printInitializing Input   return true end  function GameSystemUpdateTimer     printUpdating Timer   return true end  function GameSystemUpdateGraphics   printUpdating Graphics   return true end  function GameSystemUpdateSound     printUpdating Sound   return true end  function GameSystemUpdateInput   printUpdating Input   return true end codepre  pIs the 30log class code causing this problem I have tried various things. I am pretty sure the self it is trying to access is the first argument i.e. mytable.myfunctionself, myarg. Any ideas to fix this nil value reference. The error actually occurred on the second line inside the Start function while self.Ready do.p

Getting the list, changing the attributes and validation is successfull.p  psaveflushtrue doesnt throw any errors and returns the updated domain object, as expected. However, checking the hibernate SQL statements, all I see is SELECTS, no update. In fact, if I directly call a delete on the domain object after the save, I get a concurrent transaction exception on the domain object.p  pMy controller method looks likep  precodedef doSomething            def results  CrawlerConfig.findAllbQ      results.each  crawlerConfigInstance gt              crawlerConfigInstance.needsReview  true              if crawlerConfigInstance.saveflush  true                  renderview show, model [crawlerConfigInstance crawlerConfigInstance]                 return                        redirectaction list  codepre  pPretty straightforward. If I check for the dirty fields, needsReview is marked as dirty before the save. save updates the version on the object.p  pI currently still use h2mem as database.p  pFor me it looks like the transaction is not finished.

Negative 34 pThe most heard advice in embedded programming is keep your interrupts short.p  pNow my situation is that I have a very long running task in my main loop writing large blocks of data to SDcard, which can sometimes take 100ms. So to keep my system responsive I moved all other stuff to interrupthandlers. p  pFor example, normally one would handle the incoming UART data in an interrupt, then process the incoming command in the main loop, and then send back the response. But in my case, the whole processinghandling of the commands also takes places in the interrupts, because my main loop can be blocked for relatively long periods.p  pThe optimal solution would be to switch to an RTOS but I dont have the RAM for it. Are there alternatives for my design where the interrupts can be shortp

In order to get information about the            USB device, get the parent device with the            subsystemdevtype pair of usbusbdevice.

If you guys know a way to do this please feel free to commentp  pSo my question is, how do i get a different inset shadow on the lilastchild which will change on hover instead of getting replacedp  pThe code on a hrefhttpcodepen.ioanonpenBFznK relnofollowcedepena p  precode        ltul classhoofdmenu menugt       ltli classmenuitemgtlta hrefgtMenu Item Iltagtltligt       ltli classmenuitemgtlta hrefgtMenu Item IIltagtltligt       ltli classmenuitemgtlta hrefgtMenu Item IIIltagtltligt       ltli classmenuitemgtlta hrefgtMenu Item IVltagtltligt       ltli classmenuitemgtlta hrefgtMenu Item Vltagtltligt       ltli classmenuitemgtlta hrefgtMenu Item VIltagtltligt     ltulgt       ltstylegt          .menu li              margin 0 0 0 4px             padding 15px 15px                     Menu Item Hover effect           .menu li              boxshadow     0 9px 5px 5px rgba0,0,0, 1 inset,      dark shadow                                   2px 2px 3px 0px rgba255,255,255, 0.2,       white  top                                   2px 2px 3px 0px rgba255,255,255, 0.2        white  bottom                      lilastchild.menuitem              boxshadow     9px 0px 5px 5px rgba0,0,0, 1 inset,   dark shadow right                              0px 9px 5px 5px rgba0,0,0, 1 inset,   dark shadow                                    2px 2px 3px 0px rgba255,255,255, 0.2,       white  top                                   2px 2px 3px 0px rgba255,255,255, 0.2        white  bottom                      lifirstchild.menuitem              boxshadow      0px 9px 5px 5px rgba0,0,0, 1 inset,   dark shadow                                   2px 2px 3px 0px rgba255,255,255, 0.2,      white  left                                   2px 2px 3px 0px rgba255,255,255, 0.2,      white  top                                    2px 2px 3px  0px rgba255,255,255, 0.2      white  bottom                      .menu lihover              cursor         pointer             boxshadow     1px 1px 10px 4px rgba0,0,0, 1 inset,  dark shadow                                   2px 2px 3px 0px rgba255,255,255, 0.2,       white  top                                   2px 2px 3px 0px rgba255,255,255, 0.2        white  bottom                      .menu lihovergta              textshadow    1px 1px 3px rgba0,0,0, 0.2              text shadow                         lihoverlastchild.menuitem              boxshadow     1px 1px 10px 4px rgba0,0,0, 1 inset,  dark shadow                                   2px 2px 3px 0px rgba255,255,255, 0.2,       white  top                                   2px 2px 3px 0px rgba255,255,255, 0.2        white  bottom                      lihoverfirstchild.menuitem              boxshadow      1px 1px 10px 4px rgba0,0,0, 1 inset,   dark shadow                                  2px 2px 3px 0px rgba255,255,255, 0.2,      white  top                                   2px 2px 3px 0px rgba255,255,255, 0.2,       white  top                                   2px 2px 3px  0px rgba255,255,255, 0.2       white  bottom                                Round corners                                                                                            lifirstchild.menuitem              mozborderradiusbottomleft  5px             borderbottomleftradius      5px             mozborderradiustopleft     5px             bordertopleftradius         5px                   lilastchild.menuitem              mozborderradiusbottomright 5px             borderbottomrightradius     5px             mozborderradiustopright    5px             bordertoprightradius        5px                             Color palette                                                                                             a                       color 0861a5         ahover                 color d98500         .menu lihovergta,         .menu a                 color dddddd          body                    backgroundcolor b8d3e2         .menu li                backgroundcolor 87a0af          .menu                   fontfamily       Arial, Helvetica, sansserif         a                       textdecoration   none  a, .menu ligta      transition         1.5s ease 0.2s     moztransition    1.5s ease 0.2s     webkittransition 1.5s ease 0.2s     otransition      1.5s ease 0.2s   ahover, .menu li, .menu lihovergta      transition         0.4s ease 0.6s     moztransition    0.4s ease 0.6s     webkittransition 0.4s ease 0.6s     otransition      0.4s ease 0.6s   ul, li, ol  margin 0 padding 0 border 0 verticalalign baseline   ul    margin 100px 50px    algemeen menu .menu ul      liststyletype none   .menu li      display inline      ltstylegt codepre

Negative 34 pIm fairly new to programming, so I apologize for what is, Im sure, a relatively simple question.p  pIm looking for an efficient way to make the link color within the codeltagtcode tags of each html page different i.e. one page will have green links, while another will have blue links without having to add codeclassgreencode or codeclassbluecode to every single codeltagtcode tag.p  pI understand that I could have separate css documents for each page, but Id like to keep the whole site on one css page, so I dont have to update each style sheet separately when I want to make overarching changes.p  pIs there a way of defining the style rules in the codeltagtcode tags in relation to the class of a higher tag For example, would it be possible to sayp  precodeltbodygt ltdiv classpage1contentgt ltpgttext here  lta hrefsomeurl.comgt link here ltagt  more text  lta hrefsecondurl.comgt second linkltpgt  ltdivgt  ltdiv classfootergt ltpgteven more text lta hrefthirdurl.comgtltagtltpgt ltdivgt ltbodygt codepre  pand then define the first two codeltagtcode tags without affecting the third codeltagtcode tag in relation to the codeltdiv classpage1contentgtcode Id then replace that with codeltdiv classpage2gtcode, codeltdiv classpage3gtcode, etc. for each page.p  pThe only other thing I could think of was to try using JavaScript, which Im not too familiar. I tried insertingp  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt var myObj  document.getElementsByTagNamea myObj.style.colorgreen ltscriptgt codepre  pinto a given page, hoping that it would make the text color within all the codeltagtcode tags on that page green, but it didnt seem to work.p  pBy way of comparison, I also tested my JavaScript by changing the a to a p as followsp  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt var myObj  document.getElementsByTagNamep myObj.style.colorgreen ltscriptgt codepre  pin the hope that this would turn all my codeltpgtcode text green, but that didnt work either, so clearly I miscoded the JavaScript, for starters. p  pAny thoughts on how to alter multiple codeltagtcode tags on a given page at once without putting a class inside the tag would be greatly appreciated. p  pThanksp

Negative 34 pI have a page loaded onto my codewebBrowsercode control, and I want to prevent navigation away to a certain URL, based on some condition.

What can I do to prevent this navigationp  precode    private void webBrowserNavigatingobject sender, Microsoft.Phone.Controls.NavigatingEventArgs e              MessageBox.ShowNavigating This gets executed during AJAX navigation, which means the Navigating event occurs even during AJAX navigations         if e.Uri.ToString.Containsrestricted                      MessageBox.ShowURL Found. Trying to cancel This also gets executed when navigating away to that specific link.

Disabling JavaScript isnt an option, as some other elements of the main page still require JavaScript.p  pThanks.p

Negative 34 pfirst of all, Ive been reading a lot about this issue, but its not clear in my mind.p  pIm developing a WPF app that implies loading large sets of information from databases, localremote files, webservices, and so on. Lets say, this data is loaded into datagrids and this kind of controls.p  pMy app is working fine, but the data loading process generates bad user experiences. Im going to focus in the main window, for example, which requests a lot of data, so it takes 23 seconds to be loaded and displayed in the grids.p  pWhat I really want to see in my app when I first execute it, is the GUI loaded inmediately, and then let the data loading work, displaying a spinner, waiting object, or whatever over the grids until these processes are asynchronously loaded.p  pIn this case in my tests, no matter where the order to load the data in the code, I mean is made inside the constructor, at the end of the several events initialized, load, etc, in an Init method just before the ShowDialog instruction... the GUI window does not appear until my grids have the stuff loaded.p  pI guess that I should deal with threads, having one for GUI and another asynchronous for loading the data, but Ive made some tests with Dispatcher, Delegates and so on and nothing successful. p  pTo sum up, the goal is to load the GUI as fast as possible, and then to load the data and refresh the GUI.p  pNow Im a little confused, I read issues about threads, dispatchers, etc, but I dont know if they are appliable to my needs. I hope you can tell me the way to follow.p  pRegards, Borja.p

Negative 34 pOne way to assemble fragments produced by DNA sequencing often called reads is to seek for the shortest common superstring that contains all the reads of a given set of reads. One model for this problem is the reconstruction model, which calculates the minimal edit distance between a possible superstring that contains all fragments and each one of the fragments. What I dont understand yet is the fact that when calculating the edit distance for a given fragment, its necessary to calculate the edit distance for the reverse complement of that fragment.br An example of a fragment and its reverse complement could bebrbr ACTGTCC fragmentbr TGACAGG complement the complementary strand as we knowbr GGACAGT reverse complementbrbr According to the book Im reading the ideia behind it is to find a superstring as short as possible that either the given fragment or its reverse complement must be an approximate substring of the superstring. I know that many mathematicalcomputational models dont have a biological sense for their way of soluting a biological problem, but this recontruction model I could think its biologically reasonable to find a string that contains all the fragments of a certain region of a DNA sequence, and all the complement fragments, after all when assembling we can find both strand sequence. But a reverse complement is not something that exist for a given sequence, unless it has suffered some kind of breakrecombination event, which is something not expected, mainly when talking about conserved regions. Do you any idea why this model takes into account the reverse complements  Thanks in advance.p

Negative 34 pI have a form that renders on several pages that is basically a fuzzy search that populates a dropdown UL with results to choose from as you type from a database. The functionality is there, however on focus a 6px, empty dropdown appears with no results. Upon inspection, it is the div that contains the ul for the search results see screen shots below. Unfortunately, I have come into this project half way through and have, so far, been unable to detect how or why the dropdown is appearing before there are results to populate it. I have checked all the classes, and inspected the JS files. None of them are creating the 6px, empty box, and one of the classes is actually setting the dropdown div to display none, which I am guessing gets overridden somewhere when focus is applied. Chrome inspector has been unable to provide me with any information as to what class is causing it, except that the div itself has a height of 6px. The site is utilizing a custom CSS stylesheet, jQuery 1.9 and jQuery UI 1.10.2.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comjLP4h.png altSearch without focus img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comHosJl.png altSearch with focus and 6px dropdownp

Negative 34 pFirstly thanks for your time. I have a serious concern about Live Connects OAuth2 API.p  pI follows this, and using DotNetOpenAuth to implementintegrate LiveId authenticationauthorization for our federated identity amp access management system.p  pa hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarylivehh243647.aspxauthcodegrant relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarylivehh243647.aspxauthcodegrantap  pEverything is working fine for quite a long time. But now Im having a serious trouble when fixing the replay attack issue for LiveId login module. Lets take a look at the Authorization code grant flow from the above article.p  p4. The user agent calls the client with the redirection URI, which includes an authorization code and any local state that was provided by the client. For example ...Callback.htmcodeAUTHORIZATIONCODE. 5. The client requests an access token from the authorization servers token endpoint by using its client credentials for authentication, and includes the authorization code that was received in the previous step. The client includes the redirection URI that was used to obtain the authorization code for verification.p  pRight after the step 4, Live Connect OAuth2 server returns to my callback endpoint with the authorization code amp state, like the followingp  pa hrefhttpsssss.myapp.com443liveidconsume.idpcode406dd5580cda50ccbd37d964ec29fbb3ampstateuvygsnd3gba0jwi315kdyccs relnofollowhttpsssss.myapp.com443liveidconsume.idpcode406dd5580cda50ccbd37d964ec29fbb3ampstateuvygsnd3gba0jwi315kdyccsap  pProblem is, that authorization code could be used more than once. So it leads to the serious replay attack issue, like the following scenariop  ol lipUser A when logging in to my application, chose LiveId to signin, then hes redirected to LiveId login page. He then logged in, Live Connect OAuth2 server returned to the callback endpoint with the codexxxampstateyyy...user A then used this authorization code to obtain the access token...pli lipUser B when logging in to my application, chose LiveId to signin, he then logged in at LiveIds login page. Live Connect OAuth2 server now return with codekkkampstategggpli ol  pIf I this time, use some tools like Webscarab to capture the responserequest, then change the return from OAuth2 server to codexxxampstateggg the old authorization code was given to user A, not B. Then after that, requesting for access token using this replay authorization code was going through smoothly. And guess what I received again the ACCESS TOKEN which was given to user A before...and finally, user B can logging into my application as user A.p  pPlease be noticed that, applying the same replay attacking like above for Google OAuth2 server, I received bad request error from the server, Google OAuth2 authorization code never could be used more than once. And the code flow or exactly, the implementation for Google login amp LiveId login are exactly the same.p  pI used  DotNetOpenAuth.OAuth2.WebServerClient to implement the OAuth2 authenticating flow for both of Google amp LiveId. Again, exactly the same code, but Google OAuth2 server returned bad request when authorization code is reused, but LiveId returned the old access token of the previous user.p  pThis is a serious security problem. Hope you guys have some ideas on this. Or hopefully Im wrong on some points. Please point it out.p  pThanks very much in advance, Phuc Le.p

Negative 34 pI have a listbox in WPF that will contain a list of codeResultsViewModelcode items, however the actual runtime type of these objects could be p  ul licodeCalculateResultsViewModelcode, li licodeScenarioResultsViewModelcode, li licodeGraphResultsviewModelcode etc etc, li ul  pall of which extend the base abstract class codeResultsViewModelcode. p  pEach of these view models should be rendered differently in the codeListBoxcode so needs a different codeDataTemplatecode. I can do that just with XAML easy enough. The difficulty is that when the viewmodels are either processing or when they have failed, I need them to display a codeDataTemplatecode for processing or errored which I can only so far do with codeTriggerscode. That however then means I cant use the codeDataTemplateSelectorcode or a basic XAML style. p  pThe only solution I can think of not clean I know is to set the codeDataTemplatecode programmatically in the codeSetResultcode method of each viewmodel class, which is what gets called when the processing completes either successfully or with an error. In that codeDependencyPropertycode I can look at the return code and then programatically set the codeDataTemplatecode depending on the sucessfailure result. The only problem is I cannot figure out how to p  ol lipObtain a codeDataTemplatecode resource from a codeResourceDictionarycode just using c code  bearing in mind Im calling all of this from the viewmodel class, not the window codebehind .xaml.cs file so it doesnt have access to the properties of codeWindowcodepli liphaving only a handle to the viewmodel class, somehow obtain a reference to the codeListBoxItemcode that contains it and then programmatically set the codeDataTemplatecode on this container.pli ol  pCan anyone point me in the right directionp

Negative 34 pI feel a little embarrassed to admit that I have trouble understanding TCPs slow start, which is supposed to be a very simple algorithm. Consider this scenariop  ul lisender has CWND4 and sends all 4 segmentsli lireceiver sends an ack for each received segment its not using any kind of delayed ack strategyli li4 acks quickly arrive at the sender side where they are queued in the senders network buffer ul lisender processes ack 1, increments cwnd to 5, and sends 5 segmentsli lisender processes ack 2, increments cwnd to 6, and sends 6 segments total sent 11li lisender processes ack 3, increments cwnd to 7, and sends 7 segments total sent 18li lisender processes ack 4, increments cwnd to 8, and sends 8 segments total sent 26li ulli ul  pBecause the acks were queued in the senders buffer the sender was able to send 26 segments while only having received an ack for 4 segments. This seems contrary to the intention of slow start of placing an upper bound on the sent traffic.p  pWhere am I wrong in my reasoningp  h3Updateh3  pa hrefhttptools.ietf.orghtmlrfc2581 relnofollowRFC 2581a defines CWND as followsp  blockquote   pAt any given time, a TCP MUST NOT send data with a sequence number higher than the sum of the highest acknowledged sequence number and the minimum of cwnd and rwnd.p blockquote  pThis confirms jmans explanation.p

Negative 34 pTwo somewhat related questions.p  p1 Is there anyway to get an ID of the server a table entity lives on 2 Will using a GUID give me the best partition key distribution possible If not, what willp  pwe have been struggling for weeks on table storage performance. In short, its really bad, but early on we realized that using a randomish partition key will distribute the entities across many servers, which is exactly what we want to do as we are trying to achieve 8000 reads per second. Apparently our partition key wasnt random enough, so for testing purposes, I have decided to just use a GUID. First impression is it is waaaaaay faster. p  pReally bad get performance is lt 1000 per second. Partition key is Guid.NewGuid and row key is the constant UserInfo. Get is execute using TableOperation with pk and rk, nothing else as follows    TableOperation retrieveOperation  TableOperation.Retrievepk, rk return cloudTable.ExecuteAsyncretrieveOperation. We always use indexed reads and never table scans. Also, VM size is medium or large, never anything smaller. Parallel no, async yesp

Negative 34 pI have an RGB image M x N x 3 matrix in MATLAB that I read in. I also have a Binary mask M x N matrix for the image, which is simply 0 for some region of interest and 1 everywhere else.p  pIm trying to figure out how to mask the RGB image with that binary mask. Ive tried changing datatypes around working with either double or uint8 to see if results change, but sometimes they dont or I get an error and Ive tried using various functions like conv2, immultiply, imfilter, and so on.p  pWhat I currently do is try to apply the mask individually as it is size M x N to each R, G, and B channel of the original image. Anywhere that the mask is 0, I wish to make exactly 0 in the original image, while anywhere the mask is 1 I just want to leave alone.p  pNone of those functions above have seemed to work so far. Obviously, the method I know that will work is if I just went through and did a forloop through all of this, but that would be terrible as MATLAB has these image functions, but I cant seem to get them to work.p  pSometimes imfilter or immultiply depending on how Im messing around with the images will just stall and crash MATLAB completely. Sometimes they finish quickly but I either get an allwhite image or an allblack image through both imshow AND imagesc.p  pIve checked to make sure that my image channels match up in size with the mask, and Ive checked the values in both the image and the mask and theyre correct. I just cant seem to get the actual masking operation to work.p  pAny ideas please Maybe Im missing something in MATLABs rulesp  pHeres a current attemptp  precode NOTE The code may not be elegant but Ill worry about optimization later.

Negative 34 pI have a specific application that requires the use of client certificates for mutual authentication of HTTPS requests.  The server has a flexible certificate validation policy that allows it to accept selfsigned client certificates that are not present in the servers certificate store.  This is known to work just fine using curl as a client.p  pWhat Ive determined via testing and packet sniffing is that Microsofts ASP.NET codeHttpClientcode tries to be overly smart during the SSL handshake.  This particular client will only use a client certificate from the codeWebRequestHandler.ClientCertificatescode collection if it has chain of trust to one of the servers trusted roots.  What Ive observed is that if there are no certificates with chain of trust then the client simply wont send a certificate at all during the handshake.p  pThis is understandable default behavior but is overly restrictive and there appears to be no way to turn it off.  I have experimented with various other codeWebRequestHandlercode properties, including codeAuthenticationLevelcode and codeClientCertificateOptionscode but to no avail.p  pIs there a way to force codeHttpClientcode to send a client certificate when it is available in the codeClientCertificatescode collection, even though it appears that it will not validate on the server side  Im open to both straightforward and dirty reflection hacks solutions as I really need this client to work.p

Negative 34 pI am new to programming so please bear with me. p  pThe basic thing I am trying to achieve is as follows. Prompt the user for text in a ModalViewController, add that text to the database using Core Data and display that text in a TableViewController. p  pI have done some extensive work with this and I have the Core Data Model and entities already set up. The ModalViewController is a UITextFieldDelegate and it calls the appropriate textFieldDidEndEditing and Ive set the self.delegate  self. p  pIve created a protocol in the ModalViewController which sends the text over to its presenting view controller. The Presenting View Controller calls that Delegate method and obtains the text. So this is where Im stuck. p  pUsing breakpoints and NSLog, I can see that when the presenting table view controller calls that delegate method, it HAS the right value whatever I added into the Modal View Controller is that value. The NSLog shows it too. p  pFrom this delegate method, I call a useDocument method which basically does 3 if statements, checking whether the document is created, checking the state of the document and whether it is closed and checking whether the document has an opened state. p  pI have a NSManagedObjectSubClass to represent the Person entity, so in that class, using categories, I have a method called personWithNamecodeNSString name inManagedObjectContextcode and from the useDocument method, I call a transactionInDatabase method which in turn calls this. p  pThe Person Category goes in and does the insertNewObjectForEntityForName. It goes foward and sets the value of person.name to  name that was passed in. p  pThe debugging shows that this works and the value of person.name which is of course an attribute in the Person entity gets set as the name, until the return person at the end of this method and suddenly the value is nil. p  pIn the modal view controller, the name property is nonatomic, copy but I have tried strong and weak with the same effect. p  pBasically, I want the user to add text into the modal view controller and have that text added to the database so in the presenting view controller, when I call and do an NSFetchRequest into that entity, the result appears in a TableViewController. p  pI understand this is a fairly complex set up but at the same time, I can imagine this is also very common so any light shed on this would be massively appreciated. p

Negative 34 pI have set up a few routing rules to make sure that a packet is sent over the same interface as the socket is bound to.

Negative 34 pThere are occasions when there is some code in a file that does not have any extension. Such files will have code written in a single language, but each such file may be written using a different language like C, C, assembly language, wiki markup, and HTML for example. Similarly, the problem also happens when there is a common extension in the file name, but different files use different programming languages.p  pThe problem I want to solve is to avoid making each individual developer that has checked out a workspace from having to figure out what kind of file a source file is there is either no extension, or the extension does not imply the source language used. To do so, the author of the file has the responsibility of putting the right magic in the file to let the file be opened properly. Since Eclipse has the ability to disable the formatter based on some embedded text in the file, I thought it should be possible to specify the file type as well. The codeOpen Withcode feature allows an individual developer to change how a file is interpreted, but must be done again each time a new workspace is checked out.p  pIn Emacs or Vim, I can place magic strings at the top of the file to indicate how I want the file to be rendered within the editor. For examplep  precode  c    vim set ftcpp  codepre  pemIs there some equivalent magic for Eclipseem My attempts at finding a solution constantly pointed out a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma3353765315052how to disable the formattera.

Negative 34 pIm creating a system to save and load objects from disk. I made a codeSavablecode interface that includes methods to read and write data, and that works correctly. Anything in my program that needs to be saved can implement this interface and use it to save and read whatever data they need to work with. The problem lies in actually creating the objects when reading them from disk. Right now, I save the class name of the objects, and then when reading them I instantiate them using codeClass.forNamesavedClassName.newInstancecode. The problem with this is it requires any codeSavablecode class to have a noargument constructor, but there is no way to force that in the interface itself. So if I, or someone working with me, tries to create a Savable object but forgets to include a noarg constructor, theres going to be exceptions way down the line, and we very likely wont even discover them for a long time. I am at a loss to solve this problem, since it seems there is no way to use an interface to require a predictable way to construct an object.p

Negative 34 pIn order to better define my problem Ill explain in stepsp  ul liI need to consolidate selected data from 4 databases into one.li liEach database logs data obtained from an industrial system sensors and switches, mainly.li liDBs are in .accdb format with encryptionli liEach source database has 3 columns ul litimestamp datetime formatli lipointid Variable name  text formatli liVAL Variable value  text format in two DBs, byte in the other two DBsli ulli liVariable value is logged in one row every time it changes 1second resolution, and all variables are logged once every 15 minutes to get a snapshot of the system every so often.

Negative 34 pIm envisioning a configuration in which one exchange is bound to several queues. Each of these bindings will be unique and thus targeted at particular messages. However, some, and perhaps most of the time Id like the incoming messages to be randomly distributed among the queues. My current thought is to simply have the publisher choose the routing key at random from among the choices. That, however, requires the publisher to have some knowledge of the sort of bindings that are available. It would be better if the random selection were made at the exchange level.p  pIs it possible to specify a routing key such that the exchange will make a random choice from among the available queue bindingsp  pthanksp

Do I need to manually call codeform.validatecode or something once the hidden field gets set or is there a way to have this clear without any extra javascript codep  pMy View Modelp  precodepublic class IndexViewModel      public string SchoolName  get set      [Required]     public int SchoolId  get set   codepre  pMy Viewp  precodemodel IndexViewModel  using Html.BeginForm      ltpgt         Html.LabelForm gt m.SchoolName         Html.TextBoxForm gt m.SchoolName         Html.HiddenForm gt m.SchoolId         Html.ValidationMessageForm gt m.SchoolId     ltpgt      ltpgt         ltinput typesubmit gt     ltpgt   section scripts      ltscriptgt         function                stop validator from ignoring hidden fields             var validator  form.datavalidator             validator.settings.ignore                 schoolname autocomplete             SchoolName.autocomplete                 minLength 1,                 source [                      label ABC University, value 1 ,                      label Oklahoma University, value 2 ,                      label Texas University, value 3                  ],                 select function e, ui                      e.preventDefault                     SchoolId.valui.item.value                     SchoolName.valui.item.label                                            ltscriptgt  codepre  pThanks in advance.p  hr  pstrongEditstrongp  pSparky, here is the rendered HTMLp  precodeltform action methodpostgt     ltpgt         ltlabel forSchoolNamegtSchoolNameltlabelgt         ltinput idSchoolName nameSchoolName typetext value gt         ltinput datavaltrue datavalnumberThe field SchoolId must be a number. datavalrequiredThe SchoolId field is required. idSchoolId nameSchoolId typehidden value gt         ltspan classfieldvalidationvalid datavalmsgforSchoolId datavalmsgreplacetruegtltspangt     ltpgt     ltpgt         ltinput typesubmit gt     ltpgt ltformgt codepre

Negative 34 pI used codeFileFindcode to traverse a directory tree and codeWin32Filecodes codeGetAttributescode function to look at the attributes of files found in it. This worked in a singlethreaded program.p  pThen I moved the directory traversal into a separate thread, and it stopped working. codeGetAttributescode failed on every file with The system cannot find the file specified as the error message in codeEcode.p  pI traced the problem to the fact that codeFileFindcode uses codechdircode, and apparently codeGetAttributescode doesnt use the current directory. I could work around this by passing it an absolute path, but then I could run into path length limits, and long paths are definitely going to be present where this script will run, so I really need to take advantage of codechdircode and relative paths.p  pTo demonstrate the problem, here is a script which creates a file in the current directory, another file in a subdirectory, chdirs to the subdirectory, and looks for the file 3 ways codesystemdircode, codeopencode, and codeGetAttributescode.p  pWhen the script is run without arguments, codedircode shows the subdirectory, codeopencode finds the file in the subdirectory, and codeGetAttributescode returns its attributes successfully. When run with codethreadcode, all the tests are done in a subthread, and the codedircode and codeopencode still work, but the codeGetAttributescode fails. Then it calls codeGetAttributescode on the file that is in the original directory which we have chdired out of and it finds that one Somehow codeGetAttributescode is using the original working directory of the process  or maybe the working directory of the main thread  unlike all the other file operations.p  pHow can I fix this I can guarantee that the main thread wont do any chdiring, if that matters.p  precodeuse strict use warnings  use threads use DataDumper use Win32File qwGetAttributes sub doit    chdirtestdir or die chdir n   system dir   my attribs   open F, lt, file.txt or die open n   print open succeeded.

Negative 34 pIt is my first attempt to setup a git server and I try to manage it through gitolite. The documentation is very detailed and really helped me set the first rules for a master branch.  Below is part of my conf file that describes the access on my master branch.p  precoderepo myrepos     RW master       maintainer     R   master       engineers        master       engineers     RW              engineers codepre  pWhat I want to do now is let the users create their own branches on demand in order to push their changes. I want these branches to follow certain access rules e.g. The creator can RW and the rest R. My initial thought was to follow the personal branches concept.p  pIn the personal branches page a hrefhttpgitolite.comgitolitespecial.htmlpers relnofollowhttpgitolite.comgitolitespecial.htmlpersa the author states that Personal branches exist in a namespace of their own. That made me think that I should enable the namespaces support as explained here a hrefhttpgitolite.comgitolitenamespaces relnofollowhttpgitolite.comgitolitenamespacesa . However, the entire namespace documentation refers into creating repositories under a namespace, not branches. p  pSo my question is should I enable the namespaces or the personal branches are created somehow that I havent learnt already or missed somewhere in the documentationp

Negative 34 pI have a reporting and statistics application that displays various query results in a basic table format. At the bottom of the report results page is an option for the user to download the report result they are viewing to a CSV file. Similar functionality to online banking where you can view your bank transactions, and then optionally download the transactions history to csv.p  pWhat is the best practice method for doing thisp  pa. A download button that triggers the report query to be rerun and subsequently streamed to csv download file.p  por p  pb. When query is first run and rendered in the view, the controller saves the report object in a session variable. The download button thus downloads to report object from the session variable versus having to rerun the query.p  pThe benefit I see with option B is twofold. 1. Report query does not have to be rerun, thus less load on database. 2. Report being downloaded from session variable is an exact match of the report displayed in the report result. With option a, the report downloaded could vary from the report being viewed if there are data updates between the time the report is viewed and the time the download link is triggered.p  pAre there any risks or drawbacks that I should consider if using the session variable approachp  pThanks in advance for any input or guidance.p

Negative 34 pIm using a UISearchDisplayController in my app. When the user selects an item in the search results returned I deactivate the UISearchDisplayController. Deactivating the controller clears the text the user has typed. I want to keep it there. I try to assign the text back into the UISearchBar by setting it again after the controller has been deactivated. The text does appear in the search bar but this will cause the UISearchDisplayController to active again even though I have disable the delegate This issue only happens on iOS 7. Before iOS7, the code below works charmingly. p  precode voidtableViewUITableView tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath NSUInteger row  [indexPath row] NSString term  [keywordSuggestion objectAtIndexrow]  [search resignFirstResponder] [self handleSearchForTermterm]   voidhandleSearchForTermNSString searchTerm   [searchDisplayController setActiveNO animatedYES] searchbar text will be lost  searchDisplayController.delegate  nil search.text  term searchDisplayController.delegate  self  codepre  pIs there are a way that I can set the text of the UISearchBar without having the UISearchDisplayController thats associated with become activep

Negative 34 pMy question is reasonably simple How do I obtain a pointer to the object calling a function, without passing codethiscode   p  pThe reason I am asking, however, is slightly more complex.  p  pI am led to ask this because I am writing a class named codeSubordnateRegistrycode, which contains a heterogeneous list of lists of function delegates  callable objects with different signatures.  p  pWhichever classes wish to have delegates called must register themselves, of course, with the type of data which they wish to receive, and either a pointer to the object or an alreadyconstructed delegate.  A call from inside a class codeBarcode might look like thisp  precodeARegistry.Subscribe ltFoogt amp Bar BarFunction, this codepre  pOr like thisp  precodeusing namespace std placeholders auto Func  std bind amp Bar BarFunction, this, 1 ARegistry.Subscribe ltFoogt Func codepre  pBecause codestd functioncode is more versatile you can bind any callable, including lambdas, I would prefer to use that over raw pointers.  p  pMy problem lies in the fact that I have to specify codethiscode all the time.  If I pass an invalid pointer, or end up registering an object which is not related at all, then I will end up invoking UB at some indeterminate point in the future with no idea where it came from or where the root of the error is.  Nasty  p  pNow, if youre wondering what happens if the caller is not an object a free function, then the element will simply remain registered forever, as I will never automatically remove unregister the callable, as it never destructs.p  pAny ideas, or is this impossible as I was led to believe  Is preprocessor magic an option  Is there a better way p  pOf course, any questions are welcome.  Thanks for your time .  p

Negative 34 pOkay this is my first question here on Stack Overflow, so bare over with it if Im not asking properly.p  pBasically Im trying to code some asynchronous sockets using std.socket, but Im not sure if Ive understood the concept correct. Ive only ever worked with asynchronous sockets in C and in D it seem to be on a much lower level. Ive researched a lot and looked up a lot of code, documentation etc. both for D and CC to get an understanding, however Im not sure if I understand the concept correctly and if any of you have some examples. I tried looking at splat, but its very outdated and vibe seems to be too complex just for a simple asynchronous socket wrapper.p  pIf I understood correctly there is no poll function in std.socket so youd have to use SocketSet with a single socket on select to poll the status of the socket rightp  pSo basically how Id go about handling the sockets is polling to get the read status of the socket and if it has a success value  0 then I can call receive which will return 0 for disconnection else the received value, but Id have to keep doing this until the expected bytes are received.p  pOf course the socket is set to nonblockedp  pIs that correctp  pHere is the code Ive made up so far.p  precodevoid HANDLEREAD      while true              synchronized                      auto events  castAsyncObject[int]ASYNCEVENTSREAD             foreach asyncObject events                              int poll  pollRecvasyncObject.socket.msocket                 switch poll                                      case 0                                              throw new SocketExceptionThe socket had a time out                         continue                                          default                                              if poll lt 1                                                      throw new SocketExceptionThe socket was interrupted                             continue                                                                       int recvGetSize  asyncObject.socket.mreadBuffer.length  asyncObject.socket.readSize                         ubyte[] recvBuffer  new ubyte[recvGetSize]                         int recv  asyncObject.socket.msocket.receiverecvBuffer                          if recv  0                                                      removeAsyncObjectasyncObject.eventid, true                             asyncObject.socket.disconnect                             continue                                                   asyncObject.socket.mreadBuffer  recvBuffer                                               asyncObject.socket.readSize  recv                          if asyncObject.socket.readSize  asyncObject.socket.expectedReadSize                                                      removeAsyncObjectasyncObject.eventid, true                             asyncObject.eventasyncObject.socket                                                  break                                                                   codepre

Negative 34 pI have an application that runs under 16 Weblogic instances, distributed on 4 servers. On top of that, I have 2 Apache servers, that are communicating with the application servers. And on top of that, I have a load balancing system CSS card, that is going to be replaced by another type of card  ACE card. This works fine.p  pBut my company would like to get rid of the 2 Apache Servers, and integrate one IIS instance which will communicate with one Weblogic instance. So basically, Ill have  16 IIS instances, speaking with 16 Weblogic instances, with a 11 relationship.p  pPersonaly, Im very skeptical about this architecture, becausep  ul lipwhat could happen if a Weblogic instance goes down  I mean, the IIS instance still continues to receive requests from the load balancing system. I know that the new load balancing system can first send a request to see if the application is responding, and if so, it will let the request go further. But, I can imagine that this is taking quite a lot of time, and its not good for performance.pli lipMoreover, if the application is responding meaning Weblogic is UP and running, but this time, IIS is not, the load balancing system will send the request to an IIS instance that is down. So users will have to wait foreverpli ul  pDo you see other benefits or big drawbacks of this new solution that I may have missed  Is it a good architecture solution p  pI need a lot of answers to see clearly if this is good or not.p  pThank you guys.

Negative 34 pI have a directory with files that cannot be removed because they are used by other applications or have read only properties. This means that I cant move or delete the files like Mule does as a natural file tracking system. In order to process these files through Mule once they arrive or when they get updated without deletingmoving them from the original directory I need some sort of custom tracking. To do this I think I need to add some rules and be able to track files that arep  ul liNew filesli liProcessed filesli liUpdated filesli ul  pFor this, I thought of having a log file in the same directory that would track each file by name and date modified, but Im not sure if this is the correct way of doing this. I would need to be able to write and read this log file and compare its content with current files in the directory in order to determine which files are new or updated. This seems to be a bit too complicated and requires me to add quite a bit of programming maybe as groovy scripts or overriding some methods.p  pIs there any other simpler way to do this on Mule If not, how should I start tackling this problem Im guessing I can write some java to talk to File EndPoint. p

Negative 34 pIm making an app in C, with a lot of forms and other stuff. I wanted to localize it, so I used the integrated localization functions in VS. The app was originally in French cause I am with English translation RESXes, but now that it is on Codeplex with some other developers who doesnt speak french, I want to change the default language in the app and the RESX files so they can translate to other languages without reading French. Cause when you choose another language in VS Form Designer, it shows the default language here, French. I tried to rename all the files, but the problem is all the form properties are stored in the default RESX, the French one, so if I rename, it will break all the stuff. Is it possible to change the default language to Englishp  pEDIT I think I need to be more precise. The app is originally in French. Then I localized it in English. There is now a MainWindow.resx that contains form properties  original french localization and a MainWindow.enUS.resx that contains ONLY english localization. So if in the Designer, in Language I choose default it shows me the MainWindow.resx FRENCH, and if I want to translate, It shows me the French texts. To make the translation more easy for the other developers, I want to make the MainWindow.resx ENGLISH localization and create a seperate MainWindow.frFR.resx. I also tried to change Neutral Language in AssemblyInfo.cs, no effect.p

Negative 34 pI am developing an Umbraco intranet site where I call wkhtmltopdf.exe to create some pdfs. Those pdfs are using a main page for the content and two additional pages for header and footer. Things worked pretty fine as long as I had the site without authentication. We want to use our Active Directory accounts to login to the site and thus I have enabled windows authentication. The routine for running this is to click a button that process the page and either shows the pdf on the browser or downloads it. In any case it is the same process. In visual studio when running with debugging when it comes to the first part of the code var p  ... it throws an exception Message  No process is associated with this object. because it fails to authenticate. I can see that when I pause the code just after its execution and using the visual studio inspector. The method runs to the end but because of the error I mentioned before it produces a blank pdf. If I hardcode username and password then it works fine.p  pSite is running in my local dev enviroment in iis express. Since Windows Authentication is enabled when I browse to the site the first time I have to login. Wkhtmltopdf.exe is located in the local drive  it is not on the website.

After reading throughout various forum posts the only suggested solution that I saw was to force loging in the process by using UserName, Password etc. But that is bad since the user is already logged in and we couldshould use something like CredentialCache.DefaultCredentials .p  pA workaround that I came too was to use DefaultCredentials in requests to save the htmls locally where I can access them without a problem and create the pdfs but even that is a painstaking process, since i need to create printable css and javascripts and download them etc etc. This is my last solution which I have implemented at 80 but seems nasty also. Here is another code sample how I grab the webpages.p  precode        var request  HttpWebRequestWebRequest.Createurl         request.Credentials  CredentialCache.DefaultCredentials         var response  HttpWebResponserequest.GetResponse         var stream  response.GetResponseStream codepre  pSo to sum up. Wkhtmltopdf fails to authenticate itself so that it can grab the desired pages and turn them to pdf. Is there any neat way to make the process able to authenticate itself with current users credentials that I am logged in to the site so that it can access the pages p

Negative 34 pId like to draw a coden x ncode  chessboard in Android, using fancy custom images drawn in GIMP. To do so, I resolved to use to use four ImageViews that represent the edges or border of the board, and coden2code codeImageViewcodes that represent the squares. The result should look something like this quick sketchp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.commLqug.png altenter image description herep  pThe squares are most naturally contained in codeGridLayoutcode, which is itself contained in a codeRelativeLayoutcode which also contains the codeImageViewcode edges.

Negative 34 pIm writing a mobile application using Delphi XE6 and found in one of the examples in their repository the ability to have a Master view and alternate fmx views for different devices.  The sample looked as it if would select the correct form based on compiler directives, but I cannot seem to get that to work.  The interface looks great as I can have the Master form with the basic content, then implement inherited changes based on screen size and capabilities.  There are icons when in this view such as Add View and Remove View.  When selecting Add View, the dialog of all Android and iOS devices comes up allowing selection, then when selected it shows the additional views with an icon of the device background such as iPhone5.  The unit then shows the multiple references like thisp  precodeimplementation  uses Math  R .fmx  R .iPhone5.fmx IOS  R .SamsungGalaxyS4.fmx ANDROID codepre  pThe alternate views then show inherited properties from the Master form allowing you to alter values and include specific styles that match the platform.  If this worked it would save so much effort.  Im currently having trouble with the TStyleBook as the iOSBlack style is not compatible with the Android and throws an error on the device. When using the AndroidDark style there is a similar issue on the iOS device.  Has anyone had experience with this multiple view modep  pThanksp

Negative 34 pCurrently my website has the scrolling function with a fixed nav bar page scrolls down when you click the differernt links on the navigation. I added the function that the page you are on the has an active link. The only issue is that when you click on a different link on the navigation bar, as it passes over the other pages those links highlight until you reach the page you want for example if you are on contact and click home it highlights portfolio, then experience, then about, and then finally home once it reaches it. I dont want it to highlight the ones it passes over. p  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netgigi2233e0jbvmyk6 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netgigi2233e0jbvmyk6ap  pHTMLp  precodeltnavgt  ltdiv idicongt     ltul classicongt         ltligtltimg srclogo.jpg altlogo classicongtltligt     ltulgt ltdivgt  ltdiv idnavgt     ltul classnavgt         ltligtlta hrefhome onClickgaq.pushtrackPageview, home classlinkgtHOMEltagtltligt         ltligtlta hrefabout onClickgaq.pushtrackPageview, about classlinkgtABOUTltagtltligt         ltligtlta hrefexperience onClickgaq.pushtrackPageview, experience classlinkgtEXPERIENCEltagtltligt         ltligtlta hrefportfolio onClickgaq.pushtrackPageview, portfolio classlinkgtPORTFOLIOltagtltligt         ltligtlta hrefcontact onClickgaq.pushtrackPageview, contact classlinkgtCONTACTltagtltligt     ltulgt ltdivgt   lthomegt  ltdiv idhomegt     ltimg srchomelarge.jpg classhomepositiongt ltdivgt   ltaboutgt   ltdiv idaboutgt     ltimg srchomelarge.jpg classaboutpositiongt ltdivgt   ltexperiencegt   ltdiv idexperiencegt     ltimg srcexperiencelarge.jpg classexperiencepositiongt     ltbrgtltbrgt     lta hrefgenevieveshahresume.pdf classresumegt DOWNLOAD PDF ltagt   ltdivgt  ltportfoliogt ltbrgt   ltdiv idportfoliogt     ltimg srchomelarge.jpg classportfoliopositiongt ltdivgt      ltcontactgt ltdiv idcontactgt         ltimg srchomelarge.jpg classcontactpositiongt ltdivgt  ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pjQueryp  precodehttpsajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjquery1.7.2jquery.min.js httpajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjquery1.10.2jquery.min.js jsjquery1.10.2.min.js codepre  pCSSp  precodebody     fontsize 12pt     fontfamily Century Gothic, CenturyGothic, AppleGothic, sansserif     marginleft auto     margin 0px     padding 0px       .wrapper     width 400px     margin 0 auto     position relative     padding 28px 0 0 0       .down     textaligncenter     positionrelative        nav    nav ul      margintop 0px     width 100     padding 25px 0px     backgroundcolor f2f2f2      bordertopsolid 8dacf9     position fixed     marginleft auto     textalign center     zindex 4         nav ul li       display inlineblock         nav ul li a      textdecoration none      padding 25px 35px      color 000000      backgroundcolor f2f2f2         nav ul li ahover      color 8dacf9      backgroundcolor ffffff       nav ul li a.active      color 8dacf9      backgroundcolor ffffff          icon   .icon     float left     height 50px     margintop 0px     position fixed     zindex 10       icon ul      margintop auto     padding 10px 30px     backgroundcolor f2f2f2      bordertopsolid 8dacf9     position fixed        icon ul li       display inline         icon ul li a      color 000000      backgroundcolor f2f2f2      margintop 0px           links   alink     color 000000     textdecoration none     fontfamily Century Gothic, CenturyGothic, AppleGothic, sansserif       avisited     textdecoration none     color 000000       ahover     textdecoration none     color 8dacf9       aactive     textdecoration none     color 8dacf9           home  home     heightauto     positionrelative     color 000000     fontsize1em     textalign center     marginright auto     marginleft auto     width auto       .homeposition     textaligncenter     margintop70px          about   about     heightauto     positionrelative     color 000000     fontsize1em     textalign center       .aboutposition     textaligncenter     margintop70px          experience   experience     heightauto     positionrelative     color 000000     textalign center       .experienceposition     margintop70px       .resumelink     color 8dacf9     fontsize 1.2em     textdecoration none     fontfamily Century Gothic, CenturyGothic, AppleGothic, sansserif       .resumevisited     textdecoration none     color 8dacf9       .resumehover     textdecoration none     color b4b3b3       .resumeactive     textdecoration none     color b4b3b3            portfolio   portfolio     heightauto     positionrelative     color 000000     fontsize1em     textalign center       .portfolioposition     textaligncenter     margintop70px         contact   contact     heightauto     positionrelative     color 000000     fontsize1em     textalign center       .contactposition     textaligncenter     margintop70px      codepre  pJAVASCRIPTp  precodedocument.readyfunction       window.scrollfunction           var y  this.scrollTop         .link.eachfunction event              if y gt this.attrhref.offset.top  10                  .link.notthis.removeClassactive                 this.addClassactive                               function    a[href]not[href].clickfunction      if location.pathname.replace,  this.pathname.replace, ampamp location.hostname  this.hostname        var target  this.hash       target  target.length  target  [name  this.hash.slice1 ]       if target.length          html,body.animate           scrollTop target.offset.top  0         , 900         return false                 codepre

Negative 34 pI have a .net application that runs under both the MS implementation and Mono. It requires .net 4.5 and also wont run on old versions of Mono e.g. its broken under 3.8.0, whereas 3.10.0 is fine. p  pI thought a good way of checking whether the application can run would be to write a short bit of code that can link against .net 2.0 libraries, and do the checks there. That way its easy to determine the Mono version, and I can reuse the same code in the main application as a safety check though it may not get as far as executing that code  e.g. the application just exists without saying anything under .net 4.0.p  pThe problem I have is finding the highest version of .net that is supported under whatever runtime is being used to execute the test code, as opposed to whatever version it was linked against which seems to be what System.Environment.Version returns. I can get the version of Mono by using reflection to execute Mono.Runtime.GetDisplayName. Perhaps there is some similar solution that would work under Windows .netp  pMany thanks.p

Negative 34 pthere are plenty protocols vs multimethods comparisions, but why not to use higher order functions Lets come with example We have some data record for example. And we have methods strongserializestrong and strongdeserializestrong. Say that we want to save it into file, into json, and into database. Should we create protocol called strongSerializationMethodstrong and records called strongdatabasestrong, strongjsonstrong, strongfilestrong that implement them It looks kind of hack to create records only to use protocol. Second solution  multimethod  could take string parameter with serialization output and decide how to do this. But I am not sure that is right way to go... And third way is to write function strongserializestrong and then pass there data and serializing function.

Negative 34 pI am developing an archiving module. To do so I use a SELECT query which includes many LEFT JOINTURE to combine data from many tables.

Negative 34 pI want to return a C pointer to Python using boost. But, I dont want Boost to call the destructor for me.  p  pThe first attempt used  codereturnvaluepolicyltmanagenewobjectgtcode. So my C looks as follows. I first declare a function codereturnsFooPtrcode, and then I expose it to Python. p  precodeFoo  returnsFooPtrstdstring param      return FooFactorygetFooFromParamparam   defreturnsFooPtr, ampreturnsFooPtr, returnvaluepolicyltmanagenewobjectgt codepre  pThe problem is that according to codemanagenewobjectcode, python takes over the object ownership. And therefore would free the object once it falls out of scope. My python code looks like thisp  precodefor param in allParams     print  calling returnsFooPtr with param  , param     someFoo  CppBinding.returnsFooPtrparam codepre  pThat means each time in my loop, the old codesomeFoocode falls out of scope. And would thus call the destructor of the C Foo. I added printout in destructor of Foo p  precodeFoo      cout ltlt SOMEONE TRYING TO CALL DTOR on FOO ltlt endl  codepre  pHeres outputp  precode.... .... calling returnsFooPtr with param param1 SOMEONE TRYING TO CALL DTOR on FOO codepre  pCan I tell Python to emnotem free objects The reason I want this is that my Foo object actually comes from a HashMap of Foo  codemapltstring, Foocode, and I might need to reuse them. For example, there might be repeats in my params in python. So say I create a Foo  for param1 that came from python. Later, in python, I get a repeat of param1, so I do codesomeFoo  CppBinding.returnsFooPtrparam1code again. Problem is, param1s Foo already got destroyed.p  pI think Im ok with never destroying any of the Foo objects. I know this will leak memory, but Id rather leak memory than try to access objects thats already been destroyed. p

Negative 34 pI want to move the values from each of four Numeric UpDown controls into the DataGridView columnsrows with a button.  For instance, the operator sets the values in the updown numeric controls and then clicks the button.  The program should then add a new row to the DataGridView and pass whatever values that are in the Numeric UpDown controls into the new cells of the new row.  As of now, I have the adding new rows part of it working as well as the delete button working delete last row of the DataGridView.  Now, how to pass the Numeric control values into the cell of the new row of the DataGridView with the button  Each new row created of the DatGridView has four cells to correspond to the four Numeric updown controls.

Negative 34 pIm doing some subsetting using codesubsetcode but having some issues with using the codeincode command for my logical statement. p  pConsider a simple data structure likep  precode  x11  x21 x12  x22 1  19 2000  32 2004 2  19 2000  20 2001 codepre  pI want a subset where it is true that codex12code is either equal to codex22x21x11code or equal to codex22x21x111code. For the example above, I want the second row, since the logical statement should evaluate to codeTRUEcode if and only if codex12code is 20 or 21, which is satisfied. For this simple setup, the following works for mep  precodegt test1 lt data.framex11c19, 19, x21c2000, 2000, x12c32, 20, x22c2004, 2001 gt subsettest1, x12 in cx22x21x11, x22x21x111   x11  x21 x12  x22 2  19 2000  20 2001 codepre  pThe problem arises when I introduce additional rows. Adding just one rowp  precode  x11  x21 x12  x22 1  19 2000  32 2004 2  19 2000  20 2001 3  30 1998  32 2000 codepre  pNow, I would like to subset this so that I get rows two and three. But using the same subset strategy as abovep  precodegt test2 lt data.framex11c19, 19, 30, x21c2000, 2000, 1998, x12c32, 20, 32, x22c2004, 2001, 2000 gt subsettest2, x12 in cx22x21x11, x22x21x111   x11  x21 x12  x22 1  19 2000  32 2004 2  19 2000  20 2001 3  30 1998  32 2000 codepre  pSo now I get the row which I did not get in the first example. My guess is that it is related to the vector which codex12code is allowed to be in, i.e. codecx22x21x11, x22x21x111code, but Im not sure how to construct this so that it is implied to be rowwise and not one vector for all rows.p  pIdeas are much appreciatedp  hr  px11 is the age of an individual at time point x21, and x12 is the age of a possibly different individual at time point x22. I want the subset containing the rows in which the age x11 at x21 is logically and physically compatible with the age x12 at x22 an individual who is 19 in 2000 is either 19, 20 or 21 in 2001 depending on birthdays but I discard the possibility of the individual being the same age here, for other reasons. Thus, the first row, in which we have age 19 in the year 2000, and age 32 at 2004, is not possible for the same individual.p

Negative 34 pI am using FluentValidation in my Asp.Net MVC 4 application. I have already known that some rules are automatically generating attributes for jQuery validation library. And this script library has already known what it must check for example in case of codedatarulerequiredcode, codedatarulerangecode and so on.p  pI know that there are some functions in FluentValidation, but these are not include for clientside. For example code.Equaltruecode. I have checked a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers29407darindimitrovDarinDimitrova answer a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9808794validatecheckboxontheclientwithfluentvalidationmvc39809485herea and implemented this without any problem.p  pBut, I dont want always to create new class which is inherited from codeFluentValidationPropertyValidatorcode. And we must add this to provider like that in global.asaxp  precodeprovider.AddtypeofEqualValidator, metadata, context, description, validator gt new EqualToValueClientRulemetadata, context, description, validator codepre  pIn this case codeEqualValidatorcode already implemented in FluentValidation. But, what if we have created a validator with codeWhencode keyword. For example, I havep  precodethis.RuleForphone gt phone.Digits     .Length7         .Whenphone gt phone.PrefixId  2         .WithMessageNumbers in 2nd city must contain 7 characters  this.RuleForphone gt phone.Digits     .Length7         .Whenphone gt phone.PrefixId gt 64         .WithMessageMobile number must contain 7 characters  this.RuleForphone gt phone.Digits     .Length5         .Whenphone gt phone.PrefixId  2         .WithMessageNumbers in other cities must contain 5 characters codepre  pOf course, I can check this with jQueryJavaScript without any problem. But, this approach is not good. And in other cases you have to write so much code for generating custom attributes in client side and add new function to adapter. Or, just use jQueryJavaScript Or any other thing May be we can add JavaScript function name to codeFluentValidationPropertyValidatorcodep  pWhat do you recommend mep

Negative 34 pWe have a single sign on portal application. Users log in to portal application and has access and multiple applications. I have a requirement to log user entry on accessing my portlet. Also log when users logout. p  pMy initial thoughts were to add a log entry in my portlets doView method, but whenever users navigate back to this portlet, its logging again which is not correct. I do not have much access to portal theme and I am responsible to develop only few portlets . eg  My application Home Portlet  My Application portlet 2   My Application portlet 3  My application Submit Portlet. On successful submission, the user is taken back to My application Home Portlet. So logging in doView of Home Portlet either needs some smart logic to figure out it was triggered from master application or I should not do it in Home Portlet.p  pLogout again is present on Masthead of master application and it pretty much logs user out of portal application. I need to log an entry for that too. If not exactly possible, I should at least do some thing on session timeout.p  pPlease suggest any options.p

So, for the iPhone, where you   see the problems, it looks like there is only one navigation   controller, but there actually are two.p blockquote  pAssuming that observation is correct, how can the secondary navigation controller be prevented from pushing onto the primary navigation controller The codeUISplitViewControllerDelegatecode methods only handle collapse logic for secondary view controller DIRECTLY linked to the codeUISplitViewControllercode. In my case, the secondary view controller to be collapsed namely strongDetail VC1strong is routed via emShow Detail e.g. Replaceem segue from the master view controller and the codeUISplitViewControllerDelegatecode methods doesnt execute during this transition.p  pWith the exact same setup on a brand new project, Apple doesnt insert the secondary navigation controller onto the primary navigation controller and I dont experience this problem on a new project.p  pMany thanks.p

Negative 34 pMTOM and x509 token authentication gives an out of memory in Metro jaxws client for large files. The client does uploads and downloads of files from an WCF web servicep  pThe MTOMx509 combination works well with the upload service, but doing downloads of files eventually gives an out of memory. Im able to do downloads without memory issues testing against an identical web service that only has MTOM and no certificate authentication. p  pIs the combination really possible We have been provided with a .net client application that also gives an out of memory error.  p  pIn the policy in the wsdl the body is set to be both signed and encrypted.

Negative 34 pI am new to Python and NLP. And I wanted to start NLP self learning. So heres what I did.  I had both Python 25 and Python 27 installed in my computer. Then I downloaded and installed Anaconda setup. When i open a python IDLE, always Python 2.5 IDLE gets open. To get a higher version of IDLE opened, I then installed Python 2.7.9. Then I could open Python 2.7.9 IDLE. Even though I have installed Anaconda and it has nltk 3.0.2, I get an errors saying ImportError No module named nltk when nltk is imported. So I downloaded and installed nltk 3.0.3. But still I get the same error. Can someone tell me what has gone wrongp

Negative 34 pIm working on some apps, and need to validate some results of random number generation. I can do it in PHP, the same as the source app, but its slow. Wed like to code the validator in C for speed. The issue is that every implementation of the MT algo in C produces different results than it does in PHP using the same seed.p  pThe big issue is the data from PHP has already been made, and has been database logged for over two months now  we cannot just change the generator in PHP to a class that I know matches standard C results.p  pI believe it has to do with integer size and the signedunsigned issue PHP has   our 32 bit implementation has the MAXRAND at 2.147billion or whatever the exact number is while the same datatype in C is 2.147bil to 2.147 bil if signed, and 4.3bil if unsigned.p  pIs there a way to restrict the max integer size in C Or does anyone know of an implementation where, using the same seed, we can produce the same results I really dont want to do this in PHP  its absurdly slow in comparison.p

Its uninitialized when I try to call the function directly on document load as well.p  pHere is the code Im currently using.p  pstrongcodebehindstrongp  precodeDateTime refreshTime protected void refreshHiddenInitobject sender, EventArgs e      refreshTime  DateTime.Now.AddSeconds60     refreshHidden.Value  refreshTime.ToString     int timeToFresh  intrefreshTime  DateTime.Now.TotalMilliseconds     refreshTimer.Interval  timeToFresh     refreshTimerJS   protected void refreshTimerJS      StringBuilder script  new StringBuilder     script.Appendltscript typetextjavascriptgt     script.Appendvar dt     script.AppendrefreshTime.ToString     script.Append     script.Appendltscriptgt     Page.ClientScript.RegisterClientScriptBlockthis.GetType, DateVars, script.ToString  codepre  pstrongthe pagestrongp  precodeltdiv idautopriseUpdate classcontentgt     ltaspTimer runatserver IDrefreshTimer Interval600000 OnTickrefreshTimerTickgtltaspTimergt     ltaspLabel runatserver IDrefreshLabel Text1m 0sgtltaspLabelgt     ltaspHiddenField runatserver IDrefreshHidden OnInitrefreshHiddenInitgt ltdivgt ltscript typetextjavascript srcjsjquery1.11.3.min.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript typetextjavascript srcjsjquery.countdown.min.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript typetextjavascript srcjsrefresh.jsgtltscriptgt codepre  pstrongjavascriptstrongp  precodedocument.readyfunction       refreshJS   function refreshJS     var dt  new DaterefreshHidden.value     refreshLabel.countdowndt.onupdate.countdown, function event              this.htmlevent.strftimeMS       codepre  pThe hiddenfield value is set and the aspTimer interval counts down and refreshes right on the dot, but the countdown timer doesnt start up.

Negative 34 pIm contributing to my first large project and am struggling with a design decision. I have two fragments that populate a ListView and set a custom ArrayAdapter. Lets say the list items are emails, and the two Fragments are MessageListFragment and SearchMessagesFragment. The ArrayAdapter uses a ViewHolder pattern to inflate each message and attach an onClickListener to the star icon.p  pNow, regardless of which fragment I am in, I want the onClickListener to do the same basic thing change the status of the email on the server to starred, and determine if the email needs its position moved in the list i.e. left alone if there are no filters, moved the to topbottom if the emails are sorted by starred messages, or removed from the current list if the filter is only nonstarred messages. p  pHow can I create this behavior in a reusable manner so that I do not have to repeat this code in both fragmentsp

I have the code behind working so that I can send the email, but Im also trying to disable the send button and fadeIn a result div, which would show either success or failure to send the email.

Negative 34 h1Backgroundh1  phr Im making a program in C that uses the default Kinect Fusion demo for 3D scanning. Ive added a lot of different stuff to this program, and Im almost done. It works perfectly via debug on VS2013. I have also created an installer, but when I run the installed application I get some errors, which Ill place here below. Im using a Japanese version of Windows 8.1 64 bit, which means I have to translate all the errors that get shown to me. This means that the errors I show here may not be 100 logical or correct. Im also not very experienced with C, so I could be overlooking some very basic stuff here. So please feel free to ask any question. I might very well be that, since I dont know too much about this stuff, I might have missed something very easy for someone more experienced.p  pJust a bit more information about the program  p  ul liIts active solution platform is x64 it still gets installed in x86, not sure if that mattersli liIt requires administrator access before runningli liThere is another directory in the Program Files x86 with the same name 3DScanner that contains a different application needed for floor removal. Does this maybe mess with lookupsearch possibilities My original plan was for them to go in the same map, but the system creates two of the same mapsli liThe default Kinect Fusion program Im using is 64 bit. I had some trouble with this before since my application wasnt able to create an installer with a 64 bit reference as a 32bit project. I switched it to a 64 bit project and the installer seems to work fine except for the missing dll reference. li ul  h1Errorsh1  phr When the application crashes and I start debugging it with VS2013 I get the following errorp  precodeAn unhandled exception of type System.IO.FileLoadException occurred in PresentationCore.dll  Additional information      file or assembly Microsoft.Kinect.Fusion, Version  2.0.0.0, Culture  neutral, PublicKeyToken  31bf3856ad364e35, or one of its dependencies could not be loaded.

This is kind of weird to me since it works in debugging. Anyhow I tried to set forth and try and find what it was that I was missing. Ive used a hrefhttpwww.dependencywalker.com relnofollowdependency walkera on the file to see what it would bring up, but I couldnt make much of it. It was such a huge amount of data, and I have not clue what Im looking for.  p  pSo I fired up a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarye74a18c4vvs.110.aspx relnofollowFuslogvw.exea to see if I could find some errors that way. It certainly got me closer. The output seems to be a lot more logical, but I still dont know what Im looking for.

Negative 34 pIm working on a C project where we have to write some binary files in a Embedded Linux environment 2.6.37. Normally we are able to write the files in something like 200300 ms, but eventually the file take up to 10 seconds to be written and we have no idea why  the occurrence is quite randomic with no special event happening in other parts of the system, such as in the UI app.p  pEither way we are revising or method to write to the file and doing some research on the web a hrefq23178191herea and a hrefq11563963herea and a hrefq10195343herea we concluded that writing using native Linux code would be better then doing it pure C even though that may not end up helping much with our problem. For now we are writing in a way strongsimilar to this, that is, with these functionsstrongp  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt const unsigned long long size  8ULL1024ULL1024ULL unsigned long long a[size]  int main      FILE pFile     pFile  fopenfile.binary, wb     for unsigned long long j  0 j lt 1024 j         Some calculations to fill a[]         fwritea, 1, sizesizeofunsigned long long, pFile          fclosepFile     return 0  codepre  pWell what I would like to know is emwhich would be the native Linux way to do an equivalent operationem and in the fastest way possible The links mentioned only tell about emcopyingem files, not simply writing to them, so I suppose there might be more specific functions to be used.p  pAny help appreciated as well as any tip regarding the original problem.p

Negative 34 pI was wondering if its possible to manipulate or change the names of files upon deploying the distribution.p  pReason for during this, is that we dont have the actual files on our own servers but is provided by a partner.
