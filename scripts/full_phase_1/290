Negative 290 pI am working on a Windows utility program which communicates with some custom hardware using a standard COM port. The communication protocol which is out of my control requires me to transmit and receive raw 8bit data bytes.p  pI am currently using the following Windows API function to send data to the COM portp  precodeWriteFilehFile, lpBuffer, numberOfBytesToWrite, ...codepre   pwhere codehFilecode is a reference to the properly opened COM port, and codelpBuffercode is an array of bytes that I have stored in memory. The code works perfectly until a null character ASCII zero needs to be sent to the device. codeWriteFilecode stops sending as soon as it detects the null character because it assumes that it has reached the end of the string. This happens even though I set codenumberOfBytesToWritecode properly.p  pHow can I send raw data to the COM port using the Windows API I would prefer to use a standard API call similar to codeWriteFilecode, but I am open to suggestions.p  pI am currently using a hrefhttprapidqwiki.altervista.org relnofollowRapidQa to build the utility, but all it does is call the Windows API function directly.p  pbEditb My setup consists of a Windows PC connected via serial port to the custom hardware module. The module has a small screen on which I am able to view the transmitted characters. I have tested this setup with another thirdparty utility program. I am able to communicate with the module using this third party program, and null characters show up properly. In my own program, when I use codeWriteFilecode, a null character anywhere in the transmit stream stops the rests of the stream from being sent.p

Negative 290 pI have a legacy Java application that uses class mypackage.Foo.  I would like that application to utilize a web service that returns instances of Foo.  To connect to this web service, I use wsimport on the WSDL to generate the artifacts, and it gives me another Foo.java file.  Ideally, I would like to tell wsimport to generate artifacts that use the original Foo and to not generate any additional Foo files, but I havent found way to do that.  How do I reconcile the two Foo files within the Java application  It seems my options arep  p1 put the generated Foo file in another package.  But then assigning otherpackage.Foo to a mypackage.Foo variable failsp  p2 use the generated Foo instead of the original Foo.  In some cases, this would seem the best solution, but the original Foo has functionality that is not in the generated Foo.  Besides, making an applicationwide change is not feasible.p  p3 use the first option and write a method to manually copy the fields of otherpackage.Foo into mypackage.Foo.  If all else fails, this will be what I do, but seems horribly inelegant.p  pIm sure Im missing a simple best practice out there.  Appreciate any insightsp
Negative 290 pI recently started a project, using Apples Utility Application example project. In the example project, theres an info button that shows an instance of FlipSideView. If you know the Weather.app, you know what the button acts like.p  pI then changed the MainWindow.xib to contain a scrollview in the middle of the window and a pagecontrol view at the bottom of the window again, like the Weather.app. The scrollview gets filled with instances of MainView. When I then clicked the info button, the FlipSideView would show, but only in the area that was previously filled by the MainView instance  this means that the pagecontrol view on the bottom of the page still showed when the FlipSideView instance got loaded.p  pSo, I thought that I would simply add a UIViewController for the topmost window, which is the one declared inside the AppDelegate created along side with the project. So, I created a subclass of UIViewController, put an instance of it inside MainWindow.xib and connected its view outlet to the UIWindow declared as window inside the app delegate. I also changed  the buttons action, so that it know sends a message to the MainWindowController instance. The message does get sent I checked with NSLog statements, but the FlipSideView doesnt get shown. Heres the relevant  codep  precodeFlipsideViewController controller  [[FlipsideViewController alloc] initWithNibNameFlipsideView bundlenil] controller.delegate  self  controller.modalTransitionStyle  UIModalTransitionStyleFlipHorizontal [self presentModalViewControllercontroller animatedYES]  [controller release] codepre  pWhys this not working from inside of MainWindowController, but the exact same code is working from inside of MainViewController Ive uploaded the entire project a hrefhttpwww.deviantart.comdownload161148956Cerisesbyryyst.zip relnofollowherea for you to be able to see the whole thing.p  pThanks for helpp  p Ryp  pEDIT I think it might be related to me attaching the UIViewControllers view outlet to an UIWindow instance.

Negative 290 pI have a question regarding nlayer architecture. I thought long and hard before asking this question as theres a lot of similar questions here already... however, after literally a day and a half looking at it and reading these other answers Im still unsure. The variety of seemingly similar terminology and different approaches has me confused.p  pIf I had a BLL and a DAL in different class libraries, one way to communicate between the BLL and DAL would be to utilise an interface, kind of like a DTO defined in another separate DLL that was referenced by both BLL and DAL. My domain model entities in the BLL would implement this interface and so would any ORM generated objects in the DAL. To save my business entities I could then pass them to the DAL which would accept them fine because they implement the shared interface. I could also pass objects back to the BLL that implement this interface. This seems reasonable as both BLL and DAL then only need to be aware of the basic interface, not each others concrete implementation. p  pMy question is what is whats the best method for creating the object on the other side For example if I had a Person object in the BLL that implemented IPerson, and a PersonDataObject or whatever in the DLL that also implements IPerson, I pass Person to a method in the DAL which takes a parameter of IPerson, then in the DAL Id have to reconstruct a PersonDataObject to persist. Is this even the best methodp  pSorry I probably havent explained this all too well as Im pretty confused. A best practice for dummies answer would be much appreciated.p

Negative 290 pI know Im probably going to be berated for not properly reading the HIG or some documentation, but after going through several training videos and building a number of small projects on the iPhone, Im now trying to put stuff together on the iPad and, well, my brain hurts.p  pI understood the idea on the iPhone that one view  one screen and one view  one view controller. But now Im dealing with a piece of hardware which can show multiple things at once, I dont really understand how Im supposed to work with it.p  pThe example Ill give is the current project Im on... Ive put together a bunch of different view controllers for different screens of content splash screen, menu, article view etc. But then some of the screens have shared content. For example, the menu and the article screens both have a menu bar like a toolbar which slides down from the top of the screen and provides navigation. Also, I have a navigation element which is supposed to slide up from the bottom of the screen to navigate to different articles. These are things Ive seen in many other iPad apps Wired is an example.p  pBut Im not supposed to put more than one view controller on the screen at a time, am I Not only that, but if I do then the autorotate functionality starts going a bit mental. But if I put everything into one view controller for one single screen, I end up with 1,000 lines of code, most of which needs to be copypasted into other view controllers. Seems like a pretty ugly solution to me.p  pSo Im obviously doing something wrong... But what should I be doing Even if someone could please point me in the direction of the information I should be reading, Id be very grateful.p  pThanksp  pJoe p

Negative 290 pI am usign Eclipse PDT Helios and it sometimes freezes for 23 seconds even when working with small PHP files, like 10 rows without any includes in them or any complex statement that may cause a problem while parsing.

So for a double, the field would be something like 55.7.p  pAll I do is do a int.TryParse on the value to see if I can cast the string SomeValue to an integer. If I can, I check to see if it is greater than 20. If not, I just assume false on the check. p  pDoes anyone have any suggestions on how I could this with any data type i.e. string, double, DateTime Would Generics work I have never used them so I dont know if they would be the best solution.

Negative 290 pHi guys Im a new to NHibernate. I just started development of my next project using NHibernate. One of the requirements is that entity classes should be localized. Im doing localization the following way   Every entity which should be localized is split into 2 table and 2 entities. For example, I have an entity Service which holds some information, and another entity ServiceLocale which holds localized properties, such as Name, description etc. Same goes for tables.p  ul lipService has a protected field which holds a list of ServiceLocales. ServiceLocale has a property Culture which specifies which language the object belongs. pli lipThe list of ServiceLocale is loaded eagerly from xml mapping file. So when Service is loaded from database, all ServiceLocales also is loaded for this service object.pli lipService has public properties, Name and Description. From this properties, I check whats current culture, load appropriate ServiceLocale object and return ServiceLocales Name and Description.pli lipService is persisted using a repository. The repository checks saves or updates the service, and also all of its ServiceLocale objects.pli ul  pSo my question is is there a better way to achieve this kind of transparent localization via NHibernate Thanksp
Negative 290 pIm fairly new on CakePHP and because of so, there are some basic things that I used to do with Zend Framework that Im beaten up with Cake. p  pIm working on a project where I have to pass a named parameter to a controller  action.

In another way, if I do controlleractionurlhttpwww.google.com it will work.p  pThe work around that I had used for this is to pass the value as a base64 encoded string, but it brings some limitations. For instance, if it is an API, there is no way that you can guarantee that the system using the API can encode base64 a string.p  pAnyway the best solution would be still passing a url encoded string to a named parameter. Question is, why CakePHP does not accept a urlencoded string as a parameter and why does it throws a 404p  pThanks all in advance.p

The custom object properties have the same name as the return columns from the custom procedure.p  pWhen I run my tests I get an exception likep  blockquote   pNHibernate.MappingException No   persister for   Proj.DataEntityTracker.Domain.Entities.CustomObjectp blockquote  pSo I guess the mapping under sqlquery section is not enough for NHibernate to map the return values to the object properties.p  pSo my question is  how do I set up a mapping for which there is no equivalent table in the database such that I can map the results of a stored procedure to that objectp  pre  ltxml versionquot1.0quot encodingquotutf8quot gt lthibernatemapping xmlnsquoturnnhibernatemapping2.2quot                    assemblyquotProj.DataEntityTracker.Domainquot                    namespacequotProj.DataEntityTracker.Domain.Entitiesquotgt    ltclass namequotTrackedEntityPropertyquot tablequotTrackedEntityPropertiesquotgt     ltid namequotIDquot typequotInt32quot unsavedvaluequot0quotgt       ltgenerator classquotnativequotgtltgeneratorgt     ltidgt     ltproperty namequotTrackedEntityIDquot gt     ltproperty namequotNamequot gt     ltproperty namequotCreatedDatequot gt     ltproperty namequotChangedDatequot gt     ltproperty namequotDataTypequot gt     ltproperty namequotCurrentValuequot gt     ltproperty namequotRequestPropertyValueQuestionquot gt     ltproperty namequotNullResponseIsAcceptablequot gt     ltproperty namequotDuplicationquot gt     ltproperty namequotFrequencyquot gt     ltproperty namequotIsActivequot gt     ltproperty namequotIsDeletedquot gt     ltproperty namequotLastUpdateTaskGeneratedquot gt     ltproperty namequotLastUpdateTaskCompletedquot gt     ltproperty namequotLastUpdateTaskCancelledquot gt   ltclassgt    ltsqlquery namequotuspGetTrackedEntityPropertiesDueForUpdatequot gt     ltreturn aliasquotuspGetTrackedEntityPropertiesDueForUpdatequot classquotTrackedEntityPropertyquotgt        ltreturnproperty namequotIDquot columnquotIDquot gt       ltreturnproperty namequotTrackedEntityIDquot columnquotTrackedEntityIDquot gt       ltreturnproperty namequotNamequot columnquotNamequot gt       ltreturnproperty namequotCreatedDatequot columnquotCreatedDatequot gt       ltreturnproperty namequotChangedDatequot columnquotChangedDatequot gt       ltreturnproperty namequotDataTypequot columnquotDataTypequot gt       ltreturnproperty namequotCurrentValuequot columnquotCurrentValuequot gt       ltreturnproperty namequotRequestPropertyValueQuestionquot columnquotRequestPropertyValueQuestionquot gt       ltreturnproperty namequotNullResponseIsAcceptablequot columnquotNullResponseIsAcceptablequot gt       ltreturnproperty namequotDuplicationquot columnquotDuplicationquot gt       ltreturnproperty namequotFrequencyquot columnquotFrequencyquot gt       ltreturnproperty namequotIsActivequot columnquotIsActivequot gt       ltreturnproperty namequotIsDeletedquot columnquotIsDeletedquot gt       ltreturnproperty namequotLastUpdateTaskGeneratedquot columnquotLastUpdateTaskGeneratedquot gt       ltreturnproperty namequotLastUpdateTaskCompletedquot columnquotLastUpdateTaskCompletedquot gt       ltreturnproperty namequotLastUpdateTaskCancelledquot columnquotLastUpdateTaskCancelledquot gt      ltreturngt      exec uspGetTrackedEntityPropertiesDueForUpdate TrackedEntityID    ltsqlquerygt    ltsqlquery namequotuspSomeCustomSprocquotgt     ltreturn aliasquotuspSomeCustomSprocquot classquotCustomObjectquotgt        ltreturnproperty namequotIDquot columnquotIDquot gt       ltreturnproperty namequotNamequot columnquotNamequot gt      ltreturngt      exec uspSomeCustomSproc TrackedEntityID    ltsqlquerygt  lthibernatemappinggt  pre

Negative 290 pI have an ActionFilter with an override on the OnActionExecuted method. The filterContext.Controller.ViewData.Model is always null on a POST operation. I did find the following article that seems to be saying that it should not be null but this must have been an earlier version of MVC. This is MVC3. What should I be getting p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2444956modelavailabilityinsideactionfilterModel availability inside ActionFilterap  pUPDATE p  pIve figured out the answer to the original question. I had a custom ActionResult that outputs JSON with a custom date formatter. The problem was that the model is not being set in the controller. p  pIn my custom ActionResult the ExecuteResult method get passed the ControllerContext which would be nice if I could set the Model therep  precodecontext.Controller.ViewData.Model  data codepre  pBut this is to late in the cycle and the result is still null in the ActionFilter. This seems to mean that I need to manually set the model in the controllerp  precodeControllerContext.Controller.ViewData.Model  model  codepre  pOr p  precodeViewmodel codepre  pWhich then means I need to remember to do this every time I use this custom ActionResult.

Negative 290 pI would like to build a website that has some elements of a social network.p  pSo I have been trying to think of an efficient way to store a friend list somewhat like Facebook.p  pAnd after searching a bit the only suggestion I have come across is making a table with two ids indicating a friendship.p  pThat might work in small websites but it doesnt seem efficient one bit.p  pI have a background in Java but I am not proficient enough with PHP.p  pAn idea has crossed my mind which I think could work pretty well, problem is I am not sure how to implement it. p  pthe idea is to have all the ids of your friends saved in a tree data structure,each node in that tree resembles one digit from the friends id.p  pfirst starting with 1 node, and then adding more nodes as the user adds friends. A bit like LempelZiv.p  pevery node will be able to point to 11 other nodes, 0 to 9 and X.p  pX marks the end of the Id.p  pfor example see this treep  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comJtYSJ.gif relnofollowAn Exampleap  pIn this tree the user has 4 friends with the following idsp  ul li0li li143li li1436li li15li ul  pstrongUpdatestrong as it might have been unclear before, the idea is that every user will have a tree in a form of multidimensional array in which the existence of the pointers themselves indicate the friends id.p  pIf every user had such a multidimensional array, searching if id y is a friend of mine, deleting id y from my friend list or adding id y to my friend list would all require constant time O1 without being dependent on the number of users the website might have, only draw back is, taking such a huge array, serializing it and pushing it into each row of the table just doesnt seem right.p  pIs this even possible to implementp  pWould using serializing to insert that tree into a table be practicalp  pIs there any better way of doing thisp  pThe benefits upon which I chose this is that even with a really large number of ids millions or billions the search,add,delete time is linear depends of the number of digits.p  pId greatly appreciate any help with implementing this or any suggestions for alternative ways to improve or change this method.p

Negative 290 pIm planning to create a WebGLbased, realtime strategy game, where players are able to play together. Ill use Node.js to create the game server, and websockets for realtime connections.p  pIve broken my mind about what would be the best concept to synchronize the clients.p  pOne possibility would be to send only the orders of the users moving units, building buildings etc. to the server, which sends them to all other clients. But here, I have the problem of the delay. I think that the games would get async this way.p  pAnother possibility would be to calulate the game on the server. The clients still send the instructions to the server, but the server sends now all changed states of all unitsampbuildings to the clients in a high interval.

Keep in mind that we are just starting the code review practice I know, I know and this is why I need to monitor and measure my team participation in it. Once it becomes second nature, this will of course no longer be required.p  pThank you in advance for your help.p

Negative 290 pThe short question is Given a library emwarrantsem using a particular IOC container for its internals, when an application consumes that library, given the app emwarrantsem using an IOC container for wiring its dependencies, given if the the two containers are different, how can they play well togetherp  pThe scenario is, the application has classes defined that depend on types from the library. So when the application container attempts to build such a class, it needs to know how to resolve the type that lives in the library. p  pHeres the long winded questionp  pThis question does seem to have been asked in different shapes and form before on SO, but I cant seem to find the answer I need so I am going to have a go at it with a hypothetical oversimplified concrete example. We want to write a library for logging that users can include as a package in their solution to get logging functionality out of the box.  The public interfaces the library exposes are..p  pcodepublic interface ILogger codep  pcodepublic interface ITarget codep  pConcrete implementations are p  pcodeinternal class Logger ILogger  public LoggerITarget target codep  pcodeinternal class FileTarget  ITarget codep  pRequirements are if the user includes our package and defines a class with a property of type codeILoggercode or has a ctor argument of type codeILoggercode then our library is responsible for injecting a concrete implementation for that interface into the user defined class. By default that injected logger will go to the file system for logging because the default implementation of an codeITargetcode injected into the codeILoggercode implementation is a codeFileTargetcode by our library.p  pIf the user decides to write a class implementing the codeITargetcode interface then our library will use that to inject into the codeLoggercode class and not use its default codeFileTargetcode implementation.p  pSO what I wish to demonstrate, is their is a bidirectional dependency here. p  ol lipOur library depends on the users assemblies, since it needs to scan the users assemblies to load any extension points i.e. an codeITargetcode implementation and inject those into its own objects ahead of any default implementations.pli lipThe users assemblies depends on the library, since if the user chooses to define a class with an codeILoggercode interface as a dependency, then that user object should get a concrete reference to that interface provided at runtime by our library.pli ol  pThe easy solution is if the user and our library are both using the same IOC container, then problem is solved. But this is a strong assumption. What I wish to do is p  ol liUse an IOC container with the library that caters best to the librarys requirement, in my case its Ninject.li liAt run time somehow provide a mechanism for the user to call via some API into my library that will ensure Ninject is fired up and it scans the users assemblies, and wires everything taking into account all extension points.li ol  pSo far so good, its perfectly achievable, but here comes the tricky part.p  ul liif the user is also using Ninject, then problem automatically solved, since Ninject already knows how to resolve Interfaces living in our library. But what if the user decides to use hisher choice of IOC container li ul  pI almost want to define some sort of child container functionality in the library with an interface like suchp  pcodepublic interface IDependencyResolvingModule  T GetltTgt []T GetAllltTgt codep  pand provide an implementation that uses our librarys choice of container i.e. Ninect to resolve the type requested in the two methods define above.p  pI want the users IOC container to have some functionality where if it cant resolve a dependency i.e. an codeILoggercode,  it should hook into the codeIDependencyResolvingModulecode implementation and ask for the dependency.p  pThis way our library gets to use its choice of IOC Container, and the users code has a way to resolve dependencies that its IOC container has no clue about. Wouldnt this solution work if IOC containers out there some how provided functionality to register singleton instances of any codeIDependencyResolverModulescode found in assemblies in the executing assemblys dir and when they cant resolve a type, ask any of the singleton modulesp  pBut barring a solution that requires every other IOC container to accommodate, how else can this be solved SO the problem in a few lines is, when a third party assembly chooses to use an IOC container for its internals, what is an easy solution such that this library can simply provide a mechanism for an IOC container sitting outside to hook into and resolve dependencies that live in the library. p

This other paper emisem using a different LaTeX template, but this would seem irrelevant since my understanding is that Sweave is basically ignoring all of this until all the code blocks are identified and executed though my understanding here could be very wrong.    p  pIm running R version 2.14.2 on a x8664pclinuxgnu 64bit machine.  p  pstrongUpdatestrong Investigating the answer from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers210673aaronhttpstackoverflow.comusers210673aarona , I found that in my alternate paper where SweaveInput does work, the error message generated when I try to call a nonexistent file does emnotem contain an extra space, i.e., p  precodegt Sweaveallocatingvisibility.Rnw Error in SweaveReadFilecifile, file, syntax, encoding  encoding    no Sweave file with name .nothere.Rnw found gt  codepre  pNow, I have no idea why this trailing whitespace thing is happening on one place but not another, but this does seem like the mostly likely cause of the problem. p  pstrongUpdate IIstrong So I think this turned out to be an encoding issue after all. When I originally created my master .Rnw file, I pasted in some text that was utf8 encoded. I converted the file back to ascii using a hrefhttpbillposer.orgSoftwareuni2ascii.html relnofollowhttpbillposer.orgSoftwareuni2ascii.htmla, and still got the white space error when I ran Sweave. However, when I deleted the original SweaveInput line and retyped it, the problem disappeared i.e., it builds correctly and the extra space in the error message is gone.    p

Negative 290 pI have a seesaw ui with a text editor. The editor content is backed by a record called Task which is contained somewhere in an atom called state. A keyreleased event on the editor should change the property desc of the Task. I use the following codep  precodedef state      atom tasks []             interval nil             style style foreground black background nil  defn ontextedited [ui listenerfn]   let [editor select ui [editor]]       listen editor keyreleased         fn [evt] listenerfn text editor  defn updatetask [task text]   let [newtask assoc task desc text         tasks replace task newtask tasks state]   swap state      assoc  tasks tasks  def textupdates ontextedited frame updatetask selectedtask  codepre  pemselectedtaskem is an atom referencing the current content model of the editor. Whenever the user edits text the updatetask function is supposed to be called. But nothing happens. The function seems not to be called at all. When I call it from the repl it behaves as expected.p  pI tested if the function would get called by letting it do a simple printlnp  precodedefn updatetask [task text]    println str task   text codepre  pNow the function works fine when I edit text in the editor. Then I changed it top  precodedefn updatetask [task text]   let [newtask assoc task desc text         tasks replace task newtask tasks state]      println str task   text codepre  pnow again, it would do nothing at all. So it seems that somehow the accessing of the atoms get in the way of the event handling. Is there maybe a conflict between the ui thread and the thread the atoms were defined inp

Any thoughts from the more seasoned devs out herep  pEDIT Heres where I currently am, but it never seems to get runp  precodeltform actionltphp echo siteurl gtwpadminadmin.phppageadmanageramppagetypeaddeditamppidltphp echo REQUEST[id] gt methodpost nameadsuccessgt     lttable cellpadding5 classwidefat post fixedgt         lttheadgt             lttrgt                 ltthgtltstronggtltphp ifREQUEST[id]    eEdit Ad  else  eCreate Ad  gtltstronggtltthgt             lttrgt         lttheadgt         lttbodygt             lttrgt                 lttdgt                     ltlabel forgtadconditiongt                         ltstronggtltphp eAd Condition gtltstronggt                         ltselect nameadcondition idadconditiongt                             ltoption valuegtSelect an option...ltoptiongt                             ltoption valueiscitygtIs Cityltoptiongt                             ltoption valueislocationgtIs Locationltoptiongt                             ltoption valueispagegtIs Pageltoptiongt                         ltselectgt                     ltlabelgt                     ltlabel forgtadlocationgt                         ltselect nameadlocation idadlocationgtltselectgt                     ltlabelgt                 lttdgt             lttrgt         lttbodygt     lttablegt ltformgt  ltscriptgt     jQuerydocument.readyfunction          adcondition  select[nameadcondition]         adlocation  select[nameadlocation]          adcondition.changefunction              if this.val  Is City                  select[nameadlocation] option.remove                 ltoptiongtTestltoptiongt.appendToadlocation                            ltscriptgt codepre

Negative 290 pI have a map with custom overlay and a bunch of markers. Because Im doing markers grouping when zoom change happens I have to clear overlay, regroup items for new zoom and lay then on map again. Im doing this in backround thread to get things smooth. So you click to zoom, markers disappear, busy indicator shows in corner and new markers appear on map. all is smooth as it should however I get concurent modification exception when you zoom twice in row or zoom in and zoom out immediatelly. Ive read plenty about this but none solutions are ok for me yet.

Negative 290 pI am building a desktop app using Qt, my dev machine is win 7 x64 with japanese locale, standard system font is a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiMeiryoMeiryoa. Most of win 7 UI is in this font, though classicolder programs such as ui font customization window itself uses different font which is MS UI Gothic.  This doesnt bother me until I found that QtCreator builds my app with MS UI Gothic in one place, and Meiryo in the other. For example, qlabels, qlineedits, qcombobox all uses MS UI Gothic, but a custom completer with a qtableview i add later uses Meiryo. p  pI made most of the UI in QtCreators Designer, and the completer I added in code. If I change all widgets font to Meiryo in The Designer, then of course the app will use Meiryo therefore look right, but in this case Id rather Qt pick whatever systems default font automatically for me because win 7 will not be the only platform Ill use this program. p  pWhat raised my concern even more is that QApplicationfont returns MS UI Gothic, which is false in my case. Of course I can set appwide font using QApplicationsetFont but that defeats the whole purpose of having the native looknfeel without micromanaging fonts.p  pSo my question is,p  ol lihow do Qt determine system default font and, li liif this is a Qt Bug how do I go about getting around itli lihow should I use .ui files and still have my UI use default system font in runtimeli ol  pstrongSome clarifications and facts I foundstrongp  ol lipI want my app to use system default font for EVERY text. pli lipa hrefhttpwww.qtforum.orgarticle15135sameuiforlinuxandwindowsresult.htmlThis discussiona said that Designer will add font info regardless whether you want it or not. So Qt will honor this info rather than system default font. At least someone mentioned removing this information manually should make Qt pick system default font in runtime. pli lipIn my dev machine QApplicationfont returns WRONG default font. BUT how come a QTableView I add later in code uses RIGHT font Where did it get this infopli ol  pSo if I find where QTableView finds this info, I can get it in main, and set it app wide with QApplicationsetFont. Then whats left is manually removing all font info, then HOPEFULLY it will work. But this is like why we use Qt in the first place isnt itp

However, when my app is returned or resumed from background, the alert box is not shown, yet I can see it is trying to do the popup as screen went darker  just like how before a normal alert box is displayed.p  pThe app looks freezed up to this point, but when I try pressing the iphone home button and then go back to my app, the pop up alert is displayed.p  pI have built a facebookUtil class with singleton instance to handle all FB related activities, and the webView is actually initiated in another rootViewController class, and is passed into the facebookUtil instance.p  pstrongInside RootViewController viewDidLoad methodstrongp  precode   [[FacebookUtil instance] setWebViewwebView] codepre  pstrongInside FacebookUtil.hstrongp  precodeinterface FacebookUtil  NSObjectltFBSessionDelegate,FBRequestDelegategt       Facebook facebook     UIWebView webView   propertyreadonly Facebook facebook     property nonatomic, retain UIWebView webView codepre  pstrongInside FacebookUtil.mstrongp  precode voidfbDidLogin        NSUserDefaults defaults  [NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults]     NSLogfbDidLogin facebook.accessToken ,facebook.accessToken     NSLogfbDidLogin facebook.expirationDate ,facebook.expirationDate     [defaults setObject[facebook accessToken] forKeyFBAccessTokenKey]     [defaults setObject[facebook expirationDate] forKeyFBExpirationDateKey]     [defaults synchronize]      NSString jsFullString  javascriptmyFacebookProtocolaccesstokenBAAGPxqGDC7cBAOAUaf0jtAEXXXXXXlAAAA5QZD,actiongetWallPost,facebookIdSomeTestingPage     NSLogfbLoginAppActiveNotificationFired jsFullString hardcode ,jsFullString        [webView stringByEvaluatingJavaScriptFromStringjsFullString]    dispatchasyncdispatchgetmainqueue, [webView stringByEvaluatingJavaScriptFromStringjsFullString]        codepre  pstrongJavascript function for getWallPoststrongp  precodeltscript srcjquery1.4.4.min.js typetextjavascriptgtltscriptgt ltscript typetextjavascriptgt  function getWallPostaccesstoken,facebookId document.writeWrite after SSO  alertAlert after SSO       codepre  pWhat I have tried and my guessp  ol liIt is able to run the javascripti.e. alert is popped up if it is NOT right after SSO.

I have tried to reproduce an example with random datap  precoderequirexts requireRcppArmadillo   Load libraries  data lt matrixsample110000, 1500, 1500, 5, byrow  TRUE   Random data data[10001500, 2] lt NA   insert NAs to make it more similar to true data data lt xtsdata, order.by  as.Date11500, origin  20000101  NR lt nrowdata   number of observations NC lt ncoldata   number of factors obs lt 30   required number of observations for rolling regression analysis info.names lt cres, coef  info lt arrayNA, dim  cNR, lengthinfo.names, NC colnamesinfo lt info.names codepre  pThe array is created in order to store multiple variables residuals, coefficients etc. over time and per factor.p  precodeloop.begin.time lt Sys.time  for j in 2NC    catpasteProcessing residuals for factor, j, n   for i in obsNR      regression.temp lt fastLmdata[iiobs1, j]  data[iiobs1, 1]     residuals.temp lt regression.tempresiduals     info[i, res, j] lt roundresiduals.temp[1]  sdresiduals.temp, 4     info[i, coef, j] lt regression.tempcoefficients[2]       loop.end.time lt Sys.time printloop.end.time  loop.begin.time   prints the loop runtime codepre  pAs the loop shows the idea is to run a 30 observations rolling regression with codedata[, 1]code as the dependent variable factor every time against one of the other factors. I have to store the 30 residuals in a temporary object in order to standardize them as codefastLmcode does not calculate standardized residuals.p  pThe loop is extremely slow and becomes a cumbersome if the numbers of columns factors in the xts object increases to around 100  1,000 columns would take an eternity. I hope one has a more efficient code to create rolling regressions over a large data set.p
Negative 290 pI have a little difficulty in finding out the average and worst case time complexity. So I made this BST node removal with the following logicp  pWhen you remove a node in a binary search tree , there are 3 casesp  precode1gt The node to delete has no children. Thats easy just release its resources and youre done. Time complexity O1  2gt The node has a single child node. Release the node and replace it with its child, so the child holds the removed nodes place in the tree. Time complexity O1  3gt The node has two children. Find the rightmost child of nodes left subtree. Assign its value  to root, and delete this child. Here time compexity can be maximum ON  To find the node to be deleted can be maximum ON codepre  pSo how do you calculate the overall average and worst time complexityp

Negative 290 pNot sure if I could be doing something wrong, or if I should just ditch the ASP.NET SQL Membership provider, and maybe roll our own.  Im working hard to optimize our web appservice performance by reducing the number of database calls.  To that end, Ive hooked up Entity Framework Profiler EFProf, which is awesome.p  pIt looks like from a single call to Membership.ValidateUserusername, password, I get 8 calls to the database.  4 selects, and 4 updates.  It seems the exact same sequence of selects and updates is repeated twice in a row.  It selects user data based on username, selects again based on userId, then updates the last login and last activity dates the last two being sent as two separate update statements.p  pThis becomes a somewhat bigger deal when we add in the fact that were running on Azure, and thus the database is not housed on the same machine or right next to the web server, so each db call takes 310 ms on average.p  pAny thoughts on this  Anyone noticed this behavior before  Seems like this might just be something MSFT needs to optimize, but thought Id ask anyhow.p  pThanks.p

Negative 290 pI am updating a Journaling app that was originally written in 2010 by someone else. I am implementing MVC, have eliminated  and combined multiple controllers to conform to MVC, and using Storyboard for all scenes. At present, I have almost everything working as expected.p  pI am having several issues with the cell, which, I think, are tied to the one I am struggling with at the moment. I need to get the correct cells data transferred to a Popover, which is used to edit the Journal listed in that row. I am not using codedidSelectCellcode as it is not the cell that is selected, but buttons within the cell. I have been developing for only a few years, so I could be looking at this incorrectly.p  pNote this particular view is a codeUIViewControllercode with a codeUITableViewDelegatecode and codeUITableViewDataSourcecode, and was originally two separate controllers.p  pThis views codetableViewcode has a custom codetableViewCellcode and loads the data correctly. It has three custom buttons. The Edit button calls a table view in a popover set up as a Form Sheet and will display and dismiss correctly. But, the Title shows only the last cells data.p  pI can see why it is getting the data from the current cell, I just cannot get it to pass the chosen cell.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.

Is this the intended behaviour or a bugp  pThanksp
Negative 290 pI have a complex project with many layouts approx 40 and to reduce duplication, I am using a lot of includes.p  pI have an activity layout in layoutxlargeland which includes another layout layout B which itself is just a set of more includes in a LinearLayout.  p  pMy emulator is set to XLARGE and landscape and sure enough, it picks up the activity layout.  Ive hard coded the activity title in the layout so I can confirm which one is being used.p  pThe problem is that if I put layout B in layoutxlargeland, the ADT will not preview my layout and gives a cannot render error.  if I move layout B to reslayout i.e. with no qualifiers it works.p  pMy understand is that Android will look for a layout in the qualified folder first then, if not found, use the one in the unqualified folder.  p  pIts a problem because layout B should be different for the various resolutions and orientations.p  pAm I misunderstanding something or is this a quirk of the ADTAndroid  If a quirk, any workaroundsp  blockquote   presp  precodelayout  layoutxlargeland     activitylayout.xml    lt correctly loaded     layoutb.xml            lt cannot render codepre      presp  precodelayout     layoutb.xml            lt renders OK layoutxlargeland     activitylayout.xml    lt correctly loaded codepre blockquote  p[EDIT] Im using IDEA but dont see any relevance to the IDE.p  p[EDIT] From the IDEA logp  ps.android.uipreview.RenderUtil  InflateException You must specifiy a valid layout reference.

Negative 290 pI use GIT to manage my projects source code, using SourceTree locally and BitBucket to host the code remotely. I made a new branch, called MyFeature. At some point I renamed the branch, say to featuresMyFeature, so that the branches would be better organized I now have many more branches than before. However, it seems that now on BitBucket, there are two branches  MyFeature, and featuresMyFeature. Is there a way to remove the old branch from BitBucket, so that there is only one branch, featuresMyFeature What is the best way to rename branches so that the branch names remain consistent across different checkouts of the GIT repositoryp

Negative 290 pcom.I have SWF app where user uploads image, and that image has to be displayed in the next flow state. The flow uses conversationscoped bean actually a JPA entity that stores all userentered data. I can upload the image, store it in the bean, but PrimeFaces graphicImage facelet will not render it. I did some research, and it appears that during rendering PF GI component stores the EL expression to be evaluated with the session, and subsequent call to ResourceHandler made by IMG tag in rendered HTML fetches the same EL expression and actually evaluates it. Problem is that ResourceHandler has no access to the flow variable where I store all my data and therefore cant render the image.p  pI extended PF GI component to store actual image with the session instead of EL expression, but that has obvious performance implications storing binary data in Session is not a good idea. Also, I would rather keep all data in flowconversation scope instead of session for security reasons.p  pIs there any clean way to make PF GI component access my flow variablesp  pSnippets of my code

Negative 290 pNote I will post an answer, actually, but any other suggestion is welcomep  pThis question needs a bit of context, to prevent comments questioning my goal... p  pWhere I work, we use lot of debug, mostly done with Eclipse. I know some people question the practice of debugging, asserting that good design and analysis and appropriate unit tests makes easy to dissect a bug.p  pWell, I work on a large code base Java  Swing of a legacy application designed when Java 1.2 or even 1.1 was the latest version, and the code has lot of cruft, and even after years of working on it, I cant pretend to know more than 10  of it And the JUnit tests we have covers perhaps 1  of the code, at best it is a recent practice here....p  pSo using a good debugger is important to examine classes, the data inside them, the behavior of the software with the kind of data we provide, etc.p  pYet, stepbystep has its limits it can be slow, we can miss stuff out, and it is impractical in some cases, like looking at a paint method or with multithreaded parts.p  pSo I took the habit, in these difficult cases, to sprinkle some codeSystem.out.printlncode statements here and there, to see what methods are called, with what parameters, in what order, etc. I could use logs, but it is somehow simpler this way, and I remove these lines after the problem has been solved.p  pOne problem with that practice is that we have to scrutenize the diffs to eliminate these lines before committing. Another problem is that we use Perforce as VCS, which is fine, but requires to check out explicitly a file changing its state from readonly to writable to add such trace. It is slow with the Eclipse P4 plugin and cumbersome .p  pSo, my question is is it possible to add contextual trace to some points of code, without altering the source code itself Something that can log I was here and I saw that each time a line is ran.p  pI initially searched an Eclipse plugin, found only a proposal for the C debugger, and found out in comment in SO, I think, but I lost the reference, alas a solution which I will post below, in the hope it can be useful to somebody else. As said above, any alternative is good to take.p

On the contrary, if I use a previously used variable like m or a instead of making a new variable for the for loop, it runs absolutely fine. The address of the head pointer doesnt change. Any clue on what might be happening here p
Negative 290 pIve been looking for this info for a loooong time. Never seen anyone asking stuff like this before. I know that we can use pointer in C inside unsafe code, but thats not the case. The problem isp  precodeMyClass beta  new MyClass MyClass alpha  beta beta  null codepre  pWhat I need to do now is set beta to null and ALSO set alpha to null. Lets say that i have returned alpha in a function, so I dont have access to it anymore, so, how can I set it to null In c if beta and alpha were pointer I could just free the memory that beta points to, but I dont know a way to do that in c.p  pIn a more basic way, lets say that I have to set both variables to null, but i have acces only to one of them.p  hr  pEditp  pI did see some answers that have nothing to deal with the question i did... Ill try to explain again. Im creating a class that do some motion effect and return a instance that can be used to pause or stop this motion. The programmers that use this class are used to test variables with code ifvariable  null code before using it.  What i need is when the motion is over the instance they have is turned into null, so they know that its not usefull anymore.p  pIs there any way of doing itp

Negative 290 pI want to process some files through a batch file via drag amp drop under Windows.p  pSome of the files have unicode characters in their names, e.g. Example.txtp  pUnfortunately, many of the nonASCII characters get mangled along the way. For example, with a simple batch file likep  precodeecho  codepre  pwhen I drag amp drop a file with the example name given above I getp  precodeCgtecho CExampleeo.txt CExampleeo.txt codepre  pand so the  has been converted to eo, and naturally the file cannot be found.p  pIs there any way in a Windows batch file to access the actual unicode namepath of the files dragged amp dropped onto the batch filep  hr  pANSWER Use chcp 65001, but to prevent the command terminating the bat file, its necessary to route any output from the command to nul. I also found it necessary to put the following commands on the same line using ampamp. So my sample bat file now readsp  precodechcp 65001 gt nul ampamp echo  ampamp pause codepre  pWhich shows the unicodeutf8 versions of the filenamespaths of files dropped on it.p

Negative 290 pIm curious why GitHub calls submissions to merge, Pull requests.p  pFrom my understanding, codegit pullcode will pull all changes, from a remote repository, into a current working branch.  Then merge those changes with codeFETCHHEADcode. a hrefhttpwww.kernel.orgpubsoftwarescmgitdocsgitpull.htmlGit Pullap  pSo taking a look at codegit pushcode... a push would actually push committed changes to a repository.  And isnt that what you are doing with a Git repo  Submitting a request to merge your code So why isnt it called a Push requestp

Ive verified that I have a shared library reference to Aspose and that the required .jars are in there, and that weblogic.xml has an entry for it.p  pWe saw this same error when initially deploying on WebLogic because the Aspose library was named incorrectly, but it ran fine locally on his Tomcat server.p  pIve tried cleaning and rebuilding the project to no effect.p  pAs best as I can figure, it has to be either a Tomcat issue, or maybe an Eclipse setting.p  pHas anyone encountered a similar situation  Any ideas on what to try to resolve thisp

Ive added the draggable functionality using a local copy of the KineticJS library Im using a local copy since there are one or two functions I wanted to edit slightly.p  pWhat Im looking to do at the moment, is create a couple of JS variables to store the current location of the cursor whenever it is on the canvas.

I deployed my C MFC application in windows XP computer that previously installed some of C redistribute packages and some security patches of runtime assemblies. So these preinstalled C redistribute packages automatically deployed some runtime policies in codeWinsxspoliciescode. those policies  force to use new runtime assemblies instead of the one uses and deployed by my application. But some times these newer DLLs not there because of some other application removal or assemblies can be corrupted.

Negative 290 pIve received a project from someone that includes an Arduino Uno board with some sensors and lights with an USB cable and a documented protocol for communicating with this board through a COM port. It works fine with some existing code, but I need to port the whole project to a Windows RT environment using an ARM processor and including the Metro interface for the application. And its going to be completely rewritten...br First of all, my Windows RT device does have an USB port so it can connect to the board. But the challenge is to communicate with the board to read out the sensors and manipulate the lights and I happen to have problems finding some useful libraries, tutorials or other information about how to make these work together.br This project works fine with other Windows versions, though. I just need something specific for Windows RTARMMetro.p

Negative 290 pMy current assignment is to move rows of data between 2 Kendo Ui grids when a user clicks a button in that row. I have code that actually works, but I dont understand why and was hoping someone could explain it. I am also wondering if there is a better approach or one that makes sense to accomplish this task. The environment is Winsows 7, VS2012, MVC4, Kendo UI, jquery 1.8. The part I dont understand is the moveTo function. The part starting with     var row  elem.currentTarget.closesttr and the whole toDS.add.... is very confusing. It seems like to me that Im looping through each cell in the row and adding that to the toDs, but why all the fields Seems like I should be doing something like what is commented out below that, but that doesnt work.p  pOther things to note. I have seen a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netOnaBai2qXKy relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netOnaBai2qXKya but the customer does not want to use selections in the grids, they want to have individual buttons.

Negative 290 pI was looking at the code my developers wrote. On one of the Http handlers, they receives multiple long IO requests, which they schedule by create Threads manually for each request and scheduling it instead of using ThreadPool. It makes sense to not queue these requests on ThreadPool as it might eat up the threads meant to serve web requests.p  pNot my question is, if I create a background thread in handler and my application doesnt receive any other http request for the idle time defined to kill the worker process. Then my worker process will be killed and what will happen to those threads p  pWill they also get terminated because they were not marked as foreground threadp

No dropdown, no autocomplete query results.p  pIf I set associatedcollectioncacheall to true, then I get a dropdown, but queries only search in the preloaded records and it doesnt hit the server.p  pIf I set associatedcollectioncacheall to false, I get no dropdown and no search results, regardless of what I try or dont try with associatedcollectionscope.  The rails logs show that it is receiving the query and returning a 200 pjax response of some kind, but the view does nothing with it.p  pHelpp  pThanks, Robp  precodeclass Show lt ActiveRecordBase   belongsto artist, inverseof shows    attraccessibleartist, artistid, as [default, admin]    railsadmin do     list do       field id       field artist     end      edit do       field id       field artist     end   end end codepre
Negative 290 pI was working on this class last night as a typesafe wrapper for memory aligned objects. I have the byte array and the math to access the byte arrays memory for reading and writing as codeTcode. I am curious, though, how I can provide the most efficient access to the aligned codeTcode.p  pI tried using a public codeT ampcode called codeValuecode which I would initialize to the aligned codeTcode in the constructor initializer list. Like thisp  precodetemplate lttypename T, sizet alignment  64gt struct Aligned  private     stduint8t bytes[sizeofT  alignment  1] public     T amp Value     AlignedT const amp value  T  ValuereinterpretcastltT gtintptrtbytes  alignment  1 amp intptrtalignment  1          Value  value       codepre  pThat increases the size of the class by codesizeofT code since codeT amp Valuecode needs to store the address of the aligned codeTcode.p  pMy other approach is to not store the address but to calculate it each time access is required, via accessor methods...p  precodeinclude ltarraygt include ltcstdintgt  template lttypename T, sizet alignment  64gt struct Aligned  private     stdarrayltuint8t, sizeofT  alignment  1gt const bytes public     T const amp value const          return reinterpretcastltT gtintptrtbytes.data  alignment  1 amp intptrtalignment  1          void valueT const amp x          reinterpretcastltT gtintptrtbytes.data  alignment  1 amp intptrtalignment  1  x          AlignedT const amp x  T          valuex       codepre  pThis approach will require pointer arithmetic and a pointer dereference I think for each access but adds nothing to the size of the class.p  pAre there any other approaches or tricks to get both advantagesp

Negative 290 pI think this is an error in my own django code but just wanted to make sure. p  pDoes the number of rows or models that I have in a database affect my django RAM consumption Suppose we had a mysql table called Model.  My django code only has lazy queryset evals in this formp  precodeModels.objects.filter.blah.blah[SOMENUMBER] codepre  pThe SOMENUMBER remains at a constant, so the data which is being brought to memory is also constant and unrelated to the total number of Models or at least I hope. However, in my processes tab, as my model count increases, the RAM also increases.. To a point where it becomes too highp  pIs this meant to be or is something else leading to this  Aside from queryset  db calls, what else can lead to high memory consumption amp leaks If there is nothing else, there must be somewhere in my code where I am querying a bunch of models and im not aware. My DJANGODEBUG settings are off.p  pThank you.p

Negative 290 pI am using JQuery UI to implement resizabledraggable elements. Now I would like to define a containment for these elements that limits the resizingdragging on exactly three sides. E.g. have a look at this a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netzuule2yfC5JSFiddle examplea. You can see that the contained element can only be resizeddragged inside the parents area. p  pWhat I would like to achieve is that the element can exceed the bottom threshold and be moved to beyond the bottom border of the parent. Nevertheless the resizingdragging should still be limited at the top, right and left sides as is prescribed by the parents according borders.p  pSo a hrefhttpjsfiddle.nete2yfC219this modificationa is what I came up withp  pre classlangjs prettyprintoverridecode resizabledraggable option resizedrag  functionevent, ui      expandParentparentElement, dragElement   function expandParentparentName, childName      var dragEl  childName     var dragElTop  parseIntdragEl.csstop, 10     var dragElHeight  parseIntdragEl.cssheight, 10     var dragElBottom  dragElTop  dragElHeight     var parentEl  parentName     var parentElBottom  parseIntparentEl.cssheight     ifparentElBottom lt dragElBottom  20          parentEl.cssheight, 2       codepre  pIf you play around with the bottom border you notice that the parents area is expanded if the child gets too close to the bottom border of the parent. Unfortunately this stops after 20 pixels. You then have to release the mouse button and resizedrag again to extend the area further. Do you have any idea why that isp

I dont get why the background only draws wrong when using codeandroidclipChildrenfalsecode and only on some devices. I need that though since my codeEditTextcodes can be dragged around and need to keep drawing outside their parent container.p

Negative 290 pi have a small visualization framework written in c and want to use Qt to have a proper GUI and control over my visualizations to interact with them. currently i am using GLUT to create a window and draw a view in it. so everything i do is initialize an object of the class Visualization which does everything for me holding model and views. view itself holds a controller to process user input and manipulate the model. my main loop looks like thisp  precodeVisualization vis  new Visualization visgtcreateModelsomefile.txt visgtcreateViewunknown   ...  void demoappdisplay     clear the framebuffer   glClearColor0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 1.0   glClearGLCOLORBUFFERBIT  GLDEPTHBUFFERBIT    vis.update  looks for dirty scenes to update   vis.render  draws all views which are stored in vis    glutSwapBuffers  codepre  pwith GLUT i have a single window in which i arrange multiple views. when i order the view to draw during the main loop i can execute glCommands and everything is fine.p  pso now my problem is i want to use Qt with several windows codeQDialogscodecodeQGLWidgetscode. i am familiar with Qt and i already ported the framework to Qt. but the problem is that i have to do too much Qt integration within the framework and this is not what i want. i want to control the visualization with Qt and its GUI elements, but the draw call for a view should be made by my Visualization class as shown by the GLUT example. So there must be a way to give an inherited codeQGLWidgetcode a pointer to a view object and whenever the view should be drawn the widget has to call codemakeCurrentcode so the glCommands can draw on the context. i also can use a texture in which my view paints the current scene and then draw the texture in the paintGL or codeglDrawcode function of the codeQGLWidgetcode, but how can i tell the Widget to codeupdatecode when the view has no knowledge about it. i will emulate the main loop with a codeQTimercode set to 0. all i want to do is to by able to trigger the rendering of the codeQGLWidgetcode from inside my framework. any suggestion links examplesp
Negative 290 pThe classic maximize stock profit questions involves an array with stock prices and you are required to return the max profit that can be madep  pI understand the logic for maximizing profit for given stock quotes. In a simple way, we can maintain a running min and a running maxsofar and we check if current elem is less than min or current elem  running min is greater than maxsofar and if yes, we update our maxsofarp  pWe finally return our maxsofar which is the maximum profit that can be made.p  pNow, how do we solve the problem for 2 shot strategy Basically you are required to return i0, j0, i1, j1 such that sum of arr[j0]arr[i0]  and arr[j1]arr[i1] is maximum and also i0ltj0 lt i1 ltj1p  pI was able to think to a certain extent but couldnt figure out later how I could generalize it. So, 1st I could get the single shot solution array containing all the maxsofar elems. Similarly, I could do a similar array but starting from arr[n1] to 0. This tells me if I have to sell after today, what is the max profit that I can make. If I add the corresponding elements in array in forward iteration and array in backward iteration and I get the max element out of it, then that corresponds to max i0,j0,i1,j1p  pBut can someone first explain the logic for k shot algorithm. I guess Ill then want to understand kshot strategy as to how I can extend the 2 shot strategy to k shot. p  pthanksp

Negative 290 pI have a SQL 2005 database which is published with dozens of mostly transactional publications and dozens of subscribers .  Currently we have a local distributor.  Im trying to improve our HA for this setup and am looking at mirroring the published database.  Best practices say to use a remote distributor, in case we have to fail over to the mirror so that replication can continue.  Ive tested that and it works fine.p  pBut what if the remote distributor fails  How do I eliminate that as the single point of failure, or better, how do I recover when it does failp  pFrom testing and what little I could find on the web, I need to completely undo my replication set up remove subscribers, articles amp publications, distributor and recreate it all with the new remote distributor specified. Id be fine with that emIFem I could add my subscribers back without needing to reinitialize them.  Ive successfully used the subscriptionlsn input of spaddsubscription for similar situations, where I want to resume replication without resnapshoting amp reinitializing them .  But by completely undoing replication, the minautosynchlsn is lost as are all the outstanding transactions that go with it.p  pI must be missing something fundamental.  I know clustering my distributor adds a layer of safety, but even that could fail.  So how, or can, I switch to a different distributor without reinitializing my data on themp

Negative 290 pI have a Java application and i would like to spawn a new processstart a .bat file, that will essintially do the same thing as by doubleclicking on it. p  pI have tried both codeRuntime.getRuntime.execcode and codeProcessBuildercode in order to spawn that process. Both those approaches work they can start the .bat file, ibbut my problem is thatib they do not actually do the exact same thing as by double clicking on it. p  pMore specifically, this .bat file starts up a JVM java.exe MyMainClass which is configured to run using Windows SxS side by side. Thus, i have created appropriate bjava.exe.configb and  bjava.exe.manifestb files. When i doulbe click on that, the java application starts and the appropriate .dlls are loaded succesfuly reason i need SxS.p  pMy problem is that when i start the exact same .bat file with the exact same arguments and process environment, either by using codeProcessBuildercode or codeRuntime.getRuntime.execcode, it doesnt seem to take into consideration my SxS configuration, thus the .dlls that i need are not loaded at all, resulting in errors. p  pDoes anyone have any clue how to launch this .bat file the same way as windows laucnhes it when i am double clicking on it  Additionally, does anyone have any experience with Java SxS deployment I cannot really understand why ProcessBuilder ignores my SxS configuration.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 290 pCan two threads use the same socket at the same timep  pfor example, first i open a socket that represents a connection between Android client and windows 7 server.  i want to send an integer that is the size of the file by using DataOutputStream, then after this i will use BufferedOutputStream to send the binary file, such as a pdfp  pthe server will get the size sent by the client and then check if the size of the file received is the correct size. it compares the send integer, file size number with the actual size of the file received.  if there is any difference than the server knows that the file is not complete and then it will send a message back to the client to request that the file be sent again.p  pi have an app where the file is received as incomplete about 5 of the time. it arrives smaller than the actual size.  the only way to fix this problem is to resend the file again if it is not completep  pif i send a file, it is required to have a port open and waiting to receive a message back from the server telling the client if the file was received complete or has to be resent.p  pso is it possible to have one thread using the socket and listening for any messages and on another thread sending a message.  so that if a message is being received back from the server at the same time one is being sent.p  pit is clear that using only one thread will block and that two threads are needed but to use the same socket are there possible problems with thisp

Negative 290 pI just learned about reverse indexing. The a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiReverseindex relnofollowwikipediaa page says that p  blockquote   pIn database management systems, a reverse key index strategy reverses   the key value before entering it in the index.a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiReverseindex relnofollow1a E.g., the value   24538 becomes 83542 in the index. Reversing the key value is   particularly useful for indexing data such as sequence numbers, where   each new key value is greater than the prior value, i.e., values   monotonically increase. Reverse key indexes have become particularly   important in high volume transaction processing systems because they   reduce contention for index blocks.p blockquote  pWhy is reversing the key value useful for indexing sequence numbers Also, why do reverse indexes help reduce contention for index blocks in high volume systems In short what is the point of reverse indexingp

Negative 290 pas for my understanding, part of writing unittestable code, a constructor should not do real work in constructor and only assigning fields. This worked pretty well so far. But I came across with a problem and Im not sure what is the best way to solve it. See the code sample below.p  precodeclass SomeClass      private IClassWithEvent classWithEvent      public SomeClassIClassWithEvent classWithEvent              this.classWithEvent  classWithEvent           1 attach event handler in ctor.         this.classWithEvent.Event  OnEvent           public void ActivateEventHandling               2 attach event handler in method         this.classWithEvent.Event  OnEvent           private void OnEventobject sender, EventArgs args            codepre  pFor me option 1 sounds fine, but it the constructor should only assign fields. Option 2 feels a bit too much.p  pAny help is appreciated.p

Negative 290 pSo what this program does is take two numbers as input using the Scanner class, and calculates the lowest common multiple of those two numbers. Everything seems to be working, except the lcm method wont return anything. I may have messed something up with my break statements, but I didnt know any other way to get out of the if statement that is nested in a while loop. One more question Is using a whileTrue loop good practice or bad practice Because Ive seen lots of mixed opinions on it. If anyone has any better alternatives to whileTrue loops Id be happy to hear them.

Negative 290 pI developed and tested an application as a War file, and very late in the game the company DevOps has dictated that the application I am working on will be deployed as a shared Jar file. The deployment environment is Tomcat6 on Windows Server 2008R2.p  pMultiple 100 instances of the web application are run as separate Tomcat instances.

Any ideasp  ul liEDIT li ul  pThe root of my problem seems to be the tomcat classpath. With the web application entry point being the servlet in tomcats common class loader, whatever it does find in the application context class loader isnt available to the app. Bummer.p  pI am trying to think of ways around this. What do you thinkp  p1 Refactor the servlet instance to be something very, very generic, so that it will never need to be changed for the life of the product. Im talking a bare shell of a servlet. This class would then be loaded by the application context loader and could find the rest of the application, which can be maintained, in a jar in a shared location.p  p2 Instead of the servlet, create an instance of a servlet lifecycle object, like a codeServletContextListenercode, which would, for instance, fetch a codeloggercode object. Again this would be coded as a bare minimum with the intent that it never, ever changes. This might be easier with a context listener instead of the servlet itself. In principle would this force the application context into scopep

Negative 290 pI have an application with various references which I upgraded from Visual Studio 2008 to Visual Studio 2010. In that application, the various references have Copy Local set to false in some instances to prevent VS from producing hundreds of object already defined error messages.p  pThat all worked fine in Visual Studio 2008 but after upgrading to 2012 it seems that we cant alter those properties any more. For example, I have an assembly which I want to disable Copy Local on but when I change it to False and click apply, the setting reverts to True.p  pWhat am I missing Is there a new setting in VS 2012 that supersedes that option or something else going wrongp  pstrongEditstrong  Irrespective of the use of Copy Local, there emdoesem seem to be some odd behaviour.

Negative 290 pI started learning ASP.NET MVC few days ago and Im just curious what features MVC offers as far as updating the view goes. I have a lot experience with codeWPFcode, which has the magical codeINotifyPropertyChangedcode interface that updates the UI component the property is bound to. As far as I know, there is no such interface that we can implement in the codeModelcode that would then update the codeViewcode strongasynchronouslystrong without refreshing the page.p  pSo my question is, what are the best practices for updating the view from the model without having to refresh the page I know in traditional ASP.NET we would use AJAX to make that happen, but Im wondering if MVC offers a cleaner, more .NETy way of achieving that.p  pSo for example in my scenario, I have a WebGrid that is bound to a list in the model and I have a timer that refresh the data in the model every few seconds. What would be the best way to push these changes to the view Is AJAX the only optionp

Negative 290 pAs we all know GPS system is far from perfect and when you go around with your app using the gps when the GPS loses the signal and it starts calculating again. And if you try to calculate the distance correctly it will start calculating and for example if you were 30 meters away from your destination it will calculate for example 130 meters. Which messes my how calculation of the distance up. So I found some suggestion that I should filter the GPS coordination using the speed.p  pI want to calculate the speed without the codelocation.getSpeedcode I want to calculate the speed by comparing the distance from the last known coordinates to the coordinates at some given point and I get the speed of the device moving. And if the speed is for example greater than 15 mh coordinates are invalid and dont recalculate the distance.p

Negative 290 pI have created a small applicaiton a stronggamestrong, that reuses the same set of images several times. SO i thought i should create a class that is responsible for loading all of the different images once, from which i can then access them statically from other classes. However, i believe this may have caused an issue with the Garbage Collector, which causes my App to lag whenever the GC is run. Here is What the ImgLoader class looks likep  precodepublic class ImgLoader extends View  public static Bitmap tree1  public ImgLoaderContext context      supercontext     loadImgs   public void loadImgs      System.gc  Manually Call GC       TREES     tree1  BitmapFactory.decodeResourcegetResources, R.drawable.tree     tree1  getResizedBitmaptree1, MainActivity.height  2,             MainActivity.width  10   public Bitmap getResizedBitmapBitmap bm, int newHeight, int newWidth      int width  bm.getWidth     int height  bm.getHeight     float scaleWidth  float newWidth  width     float scaleHeight  float newHeight  height      CREATE A MATRIX FOR THE MANIPULATION     Matrix matrix  new Matrix      RESIZE THE BIT MAP     matrix.postScalescaleWidth, scaleHeight      RECREATE THE NEW BITMAP     Bitmap resizedBitmap  Bitmap.createBitmapbm, 0, 0, width, height,             matrix, false     return resizedBitmap   public static Bitmap RotateBitmapBitmap source, float angle      Matrix matrix  new Matrix     matrix.postRotateangle     return Bitmap.createBitmapsource, 0, 0, source.getWidth,             source.getHeight, matrix, true    codepre  pNote, i only use one Bitmap for the question. Essentially, when i want to use an image in my application, i sayp  precodeobject.image  ImgLoader.tree1 codepre  pWhat is an alternative to doing this, that is not so memory intensive p  pThank youp

Negative 290 pThere is basically no problem, but a feature I want to add. Its working as its supposed to. I am using Edward McIntyres strongwpbootstrapnavwalkerstrong p  pa hrefhttpsgithub.comtwittemwpbootstrapnavwalker relnofollowhttpsgithub.comtwittemwpbootstrapnavwalkerap  pThe problem is if I make a page for example for the WooCommerce with this structurep  blockquote   blockquote     ul     li Shop li     li My Account li     li Logoutli     ul   blockquote blockquote  pThe only working link will be Logout 3rd level menu. All others will be removed. Well thats fine but Ive already made my menu to show up on hover. p  pSo the question is how to disable the click function I am not sure how to explain it better. Here is the code that made the bootstrap on hoverp  precodevar slideDuration slideDuration  100 jQuery.ddmenu li.dropdown.hoverfunction       jQuerythis.children.dropdownmenu.stoptrue, true.delay100.fadeIn duration slideDuration, queue false .cssdisplay, none.slideDownslideDuration , function       jQuerythis.children.dropdownmenu.stoptrue, true.delay200.fadeOut duration slideDuration, queue false .slideUpslideDuration  codepre  pI tried everything to disable the click event event.preventDefault .. etc, but it still opens the menu on hover and when you click on the link with submenu it adds an active class and does nothing. So the higher menu is yet unusable.p  pPS This is the latest version of the nav walker so it removes the link but this is not really a problem it was breaking this even with the old one.p

Negative 290 pIm using an ADOACE.OLEDB query to access data in an excel sheet. One of the columns in this sheet is a time stamp in the 000000 format.p  pMy select max query for this column works OK but it returns the wrong max time. For example, if I have the following time stampsbr 081500br 094500 br 100000brp  pThe SELECT MAX query will return 094500, and ignore any subsequent timestamps. If I go to the queried sheet, and convert all the cells in that column to Time using texttocolumns, the query will then return the correct value of 100000.p  pThe timestamp that is recorded in the excel sheet is updated very often by many different people throughout the day using their own ADO UpdateInsert query so its not feasible for me to open the sheet and convert the cells to the correct type manually. The updateinsert queries have the cell types set to General.p  pSo my question is this. Is there a way to eitherbr A Specify the data type in the updateinsert into ADO query so the cell has the correct data type Orbr B Force the SELECT MAX query to interpret the column as a timevalue rather than textp  pIf not any suggestions on how to procedep  pEDIT I looked closer at the excel sheet im querying. I noticed that each cell has a singlequote preceding it. I think if I can get that removed when entries are recorded excel might properly format the cell as time. Here is a basic example of wha is being used to write entries to the sheet. Update [Sheet1] Set StopTime094500 WHERE Date 3122014 AND StartTime93000p  pCan this be rewritten so a single quote inst included Note there is no end quote.p

Negative 290 pI have to merge into a single sorted collection various collections that are already sorted. This operation needs to be done for not very large collections around 5 elements and with not many sources maybe about 10, but the output should be calculated fast nonblocking server.p  pIn the case of two source collections its pretty trivial, but when the number of source collections increases, there are different strategies to consider codencode source collections, each with codemcode elementsp  ul liConcatenate, then sort. It has codeOnmlognmcode complexity quicksorting codenmcode elements.li liScan all heads, select the lowest, push it to the destination collection. I guess that it has codeOnnmcode complexity scan codencode heads codenmcode times, that is the total number of elements.li liDivide and conquer, merging collections in pairs until you have only one collection. I guess that it has codeOlognnmcode complexity do codelogncode merging phases, each phase with all codenmcode elements.li liKeep the collections in a minheap using the head as the key, removing the min and readding the collection with the next head in every step. I guess that this has codeOlognnmcode too the heap remove and insert operations are codelogncode and they are done codenmcode times.li ul  pSo, the computational complexity if I havent made any mistakes of doing subsequent binary merges and the more sophisticated heapbased selection of the min element every time seem to be the equally good. Memorywise the heap might be more garbagecollector friendly, as it doesnt need as many intermediate temporary collections.p  pHave I missed something mistakes calculating the complexities or missed any alternative way to do it My implementation is most likely to be done in Javascript or maybe Scala, so any runtime concerns that might apply to those execution environments are welcomep  pBTW this is strongnotstrong related a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15494225mostefficientwaytomergecollectionspreservingorderMost efficient way to merge collections preserving orderap

Negative 290 pwhat Im trying to do My app connects with a Bluetooth accelerometer and gets acceleration data every 50ms. I want to check for these with a Runnable. And this worked fine. However, for the complete app I added two CountDownTimers p  p1 introTimer, which runs in an AlertDialog and counts down from 3. OnFinish calls i my Runnable, that deals with new acceleration data and ii a second timer calledp  p2 mainTimer, which counts down from 20 and refreshes a TextView on the UI. p  pMy problem is, that my Runnable is only executed once when it is first called. Why is that Apparently I have not yet understood the threading principles behind this. My next step probably going to be complicated is to refresh ImageViews every 50ms or maybe less often, but still with a relatively high frequency on the UI, depending on the accelerometer data.p  pI have thought about deleting the Runnable and putting my calculations in the CountDownTimer, but this might be difficult or inaccurate with the timingfrequencyperiods.

Negative 290 pTo be clear im a newbie to GWT.I was looking around for samples to implement dynamic tabs, and found this link, a hrefhttpwww.java2s.comCodeJavaGWTAddingnewtabdynamicallyExtGWT.htm relnofollowhttpwww.java2s.comCodeJavaGWTAddingnewtabdynamicallyExtGWT.htma , in which they make use of GXT.But my question is,how can i implement dynamic views using UIBinder.I want to implement something similar to browser tabs.Each newly created tab has a split panel view, whose content will be populated making a rpc request.My question is , how is the history mechanism handled when user switches between tabs.Can anyone provide with samplesThanksp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comGsZD3.png altenter image description herep

Ive tried everything I can possibly think of to fix this issue but cannot seem to get a working solution.p  pAny ideasp  pThanks,p  pLiamp

Negative 290 pI have a java application and there are only two users that can utilize this application, and the difference between them is that one can use a printing menu from a menubar and the other one cannot do his. p  pSo to do this, i made this log in frame which contains obviously the user name field and the password, and three buttons, Connect Cancel And the third one is Change password.p  pThe problem of course lies in the last one.. The application should actually change the password periodically, saying for example every 3 months the user is notified, and can do it through a Jdialog with three text fieldsold password, new one and confirm password just by clicking on the Change password button.p  pWell heres the probably stupid question how can i make the application store the password and username, notify the user, and allow him to change the password, all this without having a database Since the database is ready to use, and i didnt make it and i dont have access to add anything to it...p  pBy the way the application is a desktop app and i searched for authentication plugins and whatnot, but i only found server app authentications, and i dont think theyre the same concept, but who am i to say that, im only novice in java.p  pHope i clarified the question enough. and thank you in advance.p
Negative 290 pIm trying to interpolate spherical harmonics to a cubic, Cartesian grid. p  pThe output data of my spherical, pseudospectral simulation has codeNrcode radial levels between coderMincode and coderMaxcode, each containing a set of finiteorder spherical harmonics for longitude and latitude.

I only want to interpolate emwithin the sphereem, however for points corresponding to coderltrMincode or coderMaxltrcode, the cubic grid should have codeOUTSIDEDOMAINcode values. p  pCurrently, I have to transform the data from its spectral representation spherical harmonics codefooNr,nlmcode to a physical representation spherical grid codefooNr,Ni,Njcode, and then use a a hrefhttpwww.qhull.org relnofollowQHULLa routine in IDL to interpolate from the physical, spherical grid to the physical, cubic grid codefooNx,Ny,Nzcode note that codeNxNyNzcode for a cubic grid. p  pThe size of my data is larger than my existing code written in IDL can handle, and converting to spherical space is unnecessary for my purposes. Id like a more direct method that is standalone  not dependent on IDL, for instance. p  pAny thoughts about how this could be done Im willing to use opensource libraries, but it would be nice to not have to. p  pThanks in advance p

Negative 290 pI have a naive question regarding to floating point numbers machine epsilon. p  pAs we know, a double floating point number has a machine epsilon around 1016, while the minimal, strictly positive value of a floating point number can be as small as 10300. Since the machine epsilon is the uppppe bound of the relative error, what is the sense of using this number 10300 which is much smaller than the machine epsilon p  pI must have misunderstood something abo floating point representation.

Negative 290 pI was writing a program which has a list of applications currently installed on the phone which is accessed from a secondary activity. This activity creates a list of applications which are currently installed, checks if any of them are in a static list, and if they are, these items get checked before any user interaction. The user can then interact with the list by tapping to check an item which then gets added to the static list. p  pI am using the simplelistitemchecked and the setItemChecked function to set a particular item as checked given an index number.

Negative 290 pI have a webpage that loads comments from a MySQL table, by appending comment divs one at a time into a collective comments parent div. However, this has caused some problems with scrolling in Google Chrome. Ive tested this behavior in Firefox and it works fine there.p  pIf I refresh the page anywhere above where the bottom of the page would be without any comment divs, the refresh works just fine and the scroll bar is where it should be.p  pHowever, if I refresh the page after scrolling beyond the first appended comment div, the page sets the vertical scroll position to where it would be if the comment divs werent appended at all. I cant scroll down with the mouse wheel, as if Chrome thinks the divs were never appended, even though they are clearly there and the scrollbar shows them to be there.p  pIf I scroll up one tick of my scroll wheel from there, the page scrolls up to where the scroll bar would be after scrolling up one tick from the actual bottom of the page, with all of the comment divs appended. Its like the scroll bar is in two places at once, the bottom of the page if the comments werent appended and the actual bottom of the page with the comments appended. Very confusing.p  pScrolling by clicking and dragging on the scrollbar works just fine. Likewise, scrolling up and then scrolling either up or down from there works too. I just cant scroll downward without scrolling upward first or starting the page refresh at a point other than one below where the bottom of the page would be without the comments appended.p  pIm not entirely sure whats going on or how to fix it, and the only other mention of this Ive seen on the internet doesnt have an explanation or a solution. Would anyone be familiar with whats happening, why its happening, and how to prevent itp

Negative 290 pI developed a Shiny App with RStudio that takes input, performs a search of a lookup table, and then returns a value.  The search is not supposed to be performed until the user hits the submit button.  However, upon launch, the App automatically performs and returns the first set of values from the lookup table.  After this initial search, the app works exactly as expected.  Is it possible to suppress this initial search or have a default value and perform the search ONLY when the submit button is pressed  I cant present reproducible code, but here is the structure of my input server.R and my userinterface ui.R codep  precodeserver.R snippet outputWord lt renderText     predictWord lt inputgram     predict.functionpredictWord   Userdefined function in global.r file        ui.R snippet  tabPanelWord Prediction,      sidebarPanel      textInputgram, Enter up to three words,      submitButtonPredict,  mainPanel     h4Word Prediction,     textOutputpredictWord codepre

Negative 290 pIm towards the end of deploying my first Rails app, and Im noticing some strange, seemingly inconsistent behavior from my queries. For some background, in development I stuck with the default SQLite database settings, and in production, Im using mysql. The first thing I noticed was that sqlite and mysql dont always accept the same strings as inputs to a group clause. For example, using double quotes around my table and column names works on my sqlite development database, but doesnt work on my mysql production databasep  precodeResponse.joinsclue [cluetags, value].groupcorrect, tagid, values.id.count codepre  pLeaving out the double quotes works on my mysql production database, but doesnt work on my sqlite development dbp  precodeResponse.joinsclue [cluetags, value].groupcorrect, tagid, values.id.count codepre  pOn the other hand, using backticks works on both dbsp  precodeResponse.joinsclue [cluetags, value].groupcorrect, tagid, values.id.count codepre  pAfter looking at that, I thought it seemed a little strange to use symbols for the two columns with unique names while using a string for the nonunique columns, so I decided to rewrite the query like so to be consistentp  precodeResponse.joinsclue [cluetags, value].groupresponses.correct, cluetags.tagid, values.id.count codepre  pWhile this works, it returns a different result than the previous query. My correct field is a boolean, and when written as a symbol correct, it returns true or false. When written as a string coderesponsescode.codecorrectcode, it returns t or f in development, and 0 or 1 in production, which is the underlying boolean representation in the sqlitemysql dbs, respectively, not a ruby boolean object.p  pSo, Ive looked through the a hrefhttpguides.rubyonrails.orgactiverecordquerying.html relnofollowActive Record Query Guidea, and it doesnt seem to touch on this at all. Ideally, it seems like Id want to write everything with symbols. They appear to be database agnostic, unlike strings, and they always return ruby objects, not however the database feels like representing true and false. Unfortunately, it seems like this isnt always possible, for instance, I cant come up with a way to pass codevaluescode.codeidcode as a symbol. id wont work since all three joined tables have a column called id, and the only other thing I could think of to try is to pass it in as a hash, like sop  precodeResponse.joinsclue [cluetags, value].groupcorrect, tagid, values id.count codepre  pThis doesnt appear to work at all, the raw SQL it produces is nonsense.p  precodeGROUP BY correct, tagid, nvalues idn codepre  pSo, can anyone guide me as to the correct way to write queries like this, or do I just sort of have to hack them together as I go along and hope whatever database Im using and query Im writing gets alongp

Negative 290 pMy dataset  contains multiple columns, among them are 6 called ID1, ID2, ID3, ID13, ID23, ID33 containing a multitude of IDs.

Negative 290 pIm modifying an app for performance gains. The app has a class with many properties. Typically this class is populated in its entirety by a primary key that pulls a large query from a database. The application is in great part slow because this happens constantly throughout, even though much of the time only one two properties in the class are needed in a given section of code. The existing large class has only a default constructor and all of its properties are nullable or have default values. In code below ignore lack of constructors and how these objects are populated.p  precodepublic class Contract      public enum ContractStatus              Draft, Active, Inactive           private Int32 contractId  DALC.DefaultInt32     private String name  DALC.DefaultString     private ContractStatus status     private ContractType contractType  null     private CurrencyType currencyType  null     private Company company  null  codepre  pAs you can see it has its own properties, and also references other classes e.g. ContractType, Company.p  pA few approaches Ive thought of in light of common design patternsp  p1 refactor this hugely and break up those smaller subsections into their own classes with their own properties. Then reconstruct that large class with all of the smaller ones when it is needed. This will be quite laborious, though even if it sounds ideal and consistent with SOLID OOD principles.p  p2 Create new classes that simply contain the large class, but only expose one or two of its properties. Im still creating a full blown version of the original, large class, but I will only populate the data I need. This will be via simple DB query, thus the bulk of the class will sit there unused and its null default classes its referencing wont ever be constructed.p  precodepublic class ContractName      Contract contract      public ContractName              contract  new Contract           public String Name              get  return contract.Name          set  contract.Name  value        codepre  p3 Add new constructors to existing large class with a parameter indicating what chunks of code I want to actually populate. This sounds messy and kind of nasty and wrong, and would leave me in the scenario where if Contract is created by a contract ID in one section of code it has different info than if created by contract ID elsewhere.p  pThanks for any ideasp
Negative 290 pIm interested in a hrefhttpc2.comcgiwikiContinuationImplementation relnofollowcontinuationsa, specifically in Pythons CAPI. From what i understand, the nature of continuations requires unabstracting lowlevel calling conventions in order to manipulate the call stack as needed. I was fortunate enough to come across a few examples of these scattered a hrefhttpsgithub.compythongreenletgreenletblobmastergreenlet.c relnofollowherea and a hrefhttpwww.nightmare.comrushingcopythoncoroutinemodule.c relnofollowtherea. In the few examples ive come across, this unabstraction is done using either clever C with assumptions about the environment, or custom assembly.p  pHowever, whats cool about Python is that it has its own interpreter stack made up of codePyFrameObjectcodes. Assuming singlethreaded applications for now, strongshouldnt it be enough to just switch inandout codePyFrameObjectscodes to implement continuations in Pythons CAPIstrong Why do these authors even bother with the lowlevel stuffp

Negative 290 pI have been tasked with creating a monthly backup of photos, these need to be moved from where they are to somewhere else, sorted by date into folders, then burnt to disk in monthly lots.br In theory this should be simple, even though its a new process and we have roughly a year worth of photos, once its been done once we can just run it every month from now on.p  pSo first thought isbr Copy from location A to location B, sort into subfolders based on created date MONTHYEAR, burn each folder to disk.p  pThis is quite simple and would have been done now if that was the case, my issue is thisbr All the photos are from other companies who we provide a service for, there are 15 companies and each have their own folder. Inside each folder is 5 more folders, ONE of which has the images, others have config files database backups etc etc.p  pSo as an example the structure is  p  blockquote   pDatabr     Company1br        IMAGESbr        Other1br        Other2br     Company2br        IMAGESbr        Other1br        Other2br     Company3br         IMAGESbr         Other1br         Other2  p blockquote  pSo within each IMAGE folder are the photos which emarentem sorted by date. I need to copy only those folders to a structure which looks like this  p  blockquote   pBackupsbr       0115br          Company1br          Company2br          Company3br       0215br          Company1br          Company2br          Company3br       0315br           Company1br           Company2br           Company3  p blockquote  pThat way I can simple burn each months folder to its own disk and in it all the images are sorted by company.p  pSo create a folder with name of MONTHYEAR then inside that, create folders for each company Company1 Company2 etc and then in each of those folders have the photos from that company and that month.p  pI have attempted to write this in batch to almost 0 success. Though I no longer have the codedeleted it in annoyance after it not working a few too many times  , it used a lot of nested IF statements and variables being set to maintain the name of the parent folder of the parent folder etc etc then looping around to do the whole process on the next folder...p  pSo long story short, I need some way to script the moving of images into folders based on date and the name of the folder two levels above it. Also if it could create the folders where its being copied to that would be great.br Even if someone could just provide some pointers of where to start in batchor VBS, or some psuedo code which I can work off of I would GREATLY appreciate it.p  pThank you very much,br this confused newbiep

Negative 290 pI am builing an MVC 5 web app and I am using entity framework 6 and I have MS SQL Server 2008 R2 as my database. I use connection pooling to ensure that I get a connection as fast as possible for db operations. My connection string in my Web.config is as followsp  precodeltadd nameMyConnectionPoolConnectionString connectionStringData SourceMyHOSTInitial CatalogTESTDBUser IdsaPasswordpassword1 Min Pool Size10MultipleActiveResultSetsTrue providerNameSystem.Data.SqlClient gt codepre  pI notice that  obtaining a connection from the connection pool is very  fast i.e. some tens to hundreds of millisecondsp  pHowever, what I have also noticed is that closing the connection which in a connection pool means the connection is returned to the pool takes a rather long time i.e. on the average between 2000ms and 5000ms 2  5 secs. p  pHere is an excerpt from my profiling log p  pTime taken to open connection p  precode20150218 210655,497 Opened connection at 18022015 210655 92.65 ms codepre  pTime taken to close  return connection p  precode Closed connection at 18022015 210701 2543.06 ms codepre  pNotice that opening the connection takes 92ms and closing the connection takes 2500ms. BTW, these stats are provided my the EF framework itself i.e. by setting the Log property of the Database prop on the EF context i.e. p  precodeMyTestAppDbContext.Database.Log  Logger.Debug codepre  pWhat I dont understand is why it is so fast to get a connection from the connection pool but it takes so long for EF to return the connection back to the pool i.e. close the connection and more importantly how to speed up the releaseclosing of the connectionp  pThis is quite important for me because the web app needs to be quite responsive and as I have to create the EF Dbcontext for every request, if EF adds an extra 2  5 secs overhead to just close  release a connection, it reduces the responsiveness of the app.p  pMyTestAppDbContext.csp  precodepublic partial class MyTestAppDbContext

Unfortunately, I learned the hard way that implementing a DLL in Qt is different than in other languages as I will explain laterp  pstrongProblem Statementstrong Implement a multithreaded DLL in Qt that can easily be used by nonQt applicationsp  pstrongBackground Infostrongp  pQt is the tool of choice because its inherent crossplatform compatibility The API makes use of callback functions to tell the calling application when certain events have occurredp  pstrongAssumptionsstrongp  pThe applications that will link to the Qt dll are compatible with Qt compilers cc mingw, C msvc Signalsslots are used to communicate from main thread to worker threads e.g. tell a worker thread to collect data as well as from worker threads back to main threads e.g. notify the main thread via a callback function that data collection has completedp  pstrongProblem Descriptionstrongp  pI learned the hard way that writing a multithreaded DLL in QT is different than other languages because of Qts architecture. Problems arise due to QT event loops that handle spwaning threads, timers, sending signals, and receiving slots. This Qt even loop QApplication.exec can be called from the main application when the main app is Qt Qt has access to QT specific libraries. However, when the calling application is not Qt, C for example, the calling application aka the main thread does not have the ability to call Qt specific libraries therefore, making it necessary to design your DLL with an event loop embedded inside of it. It is important that this is considered upfront in the design because it is difficult to shoehorn it in later because QApplication.exec is blocking. p  pIn a nutshell, I am looking for oppinions on the best way to architect a multithreaded dll in Qt such that it is compatible w nonQT applications. p  pstrongIn Summarystrongp  ul liWhere does the event loop reside in the overall architecture  li liWhat special considerations should you make in regards to signalsslotsli liAre there any gotchas that the community has come across when implementing something similar to what I have describedli ul

Negative 290 pI am playing around to show inline cells when one cell is selected, I have been reading for a lot, and after all used the DateCell example of Apple developers.p  pI have modified it to accept sections, avoiding the need of having one row below the inline row, accepting several types of custom cells, etc... at first I had one issue when retrieving the height of my inline cell on my iOS8 iPhone 5s simulator.p  pHere is the code of the DateCell samplep  precode obtain the picker view cells height, works because the cell was predefined in our storyboard UITableViewCell pickerViewCellToCheck  [self.tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifierkDatePickerID] self.pickerCellRowHeight  CGRectGetHeightpickerViewCellToCheck.frame codepre  pSimple, right ok, working on the same simulator for the DateCell app, but not for my app. I have set every settable item on my prototype cell and tableview like the DateCell sample on IB...but getting 0 as height.

Negative 290 pI am using SWIG to wrap a C extension module for Python. My module compiles and imports successfully. About 50 of the time the Python script that imports it is stable, running without error even when I leave it looping continual tests of the extension module for 10 hours.

Out of these bad runs, on occasion Python crashes, but the rest of the time I get a RuntimeError.

Negative 290 pI am using Zurb Foundation and I am looking at making a SERP preview tool for my CMS I am creating. p  pFirst of all I realize I am mixing Javascript with JQuery but that is because I could not get a basic JQuery alert working without putting it in the jsapp.js file and then it would not let me select element by id. So I have enclosed the JQuery inside a javascript onload function and it works fine. p  pThe script finds the focus keyword from the input and bolds all the matching words in the SERP preview. This all works fine, except when I create a new focus keyword the it bolds all the new matching words but keeps bold all of the old matching words.p  pFor instance if my description was Test me and the focus keyword is test then it will show as strongTeststrong me.

Negative 290 pIm trying to use Angularstraps affix service to programmatically attach affix behavior to 3 different elements two of these must respond to whether the target browser is roughly desktopwidth or greater in which case they MUST NOT affix, and the third must always affix.  A complicating factor is whether or not the receiving device is either a desktop browser or a mobile device amp further whether said mobile device is either in landscape or portrait mode, because there are stylistic adjustments required for various device breakpoints, and this drives changes to the affix offsets for these three elements.p  pTo this end Ive managed to put together some logic for handling these different cases, and to keep sane Ive located the logic for my use of affix within its own directive attached to my Angular app.  Ive also isolated logic for detecting orientationchange events in its own directive, and within my affix directive Ive got a callback setup to trip on orientchange, which calls my handleFixes function, which in turn calls my helper functions to recalculate the proper offsets and then calls affix on each affixed element to update its behavior.p  pIn theory this should work fine.  In practice it looks like the affix service is unable to attach callbacks to scroll, click or resize events, because its expecting targetEl to be an element but instead its undefined.  As a result, affix isnt working at all.p  pI emthinkem whats happening is my directive definition isnt properly communicating the intended target element the BODY tag into affix, but that may not be the end of it.p  pHeres my directive definition strongEDITEDstrongp  precode N.B.

Negative 290 pI am trying to develop a parallel random walker simulation with MPI and C. p  pIn my simulation, each process can be thought of as a cell which can contain particles random walkers. The cells are aligned in one dimension with periodic boundary conditions i.e. ring topology.p  pIn each time step, a particle can stay in its cell or go into the left or right neighbour cell with a certain probability. To make it a bit easier, only the last particle in each cells list can walk. If the particle walks, it has to be sent to the process with the according rank MPIIsend  MPIProbe  MPIRecv  MPIWaitall. p  pHowever, after the first step my particles start disappearing, i.e. the messages are getting lost somehow.p  pBelow is a minimal example sorry if its still rather long. To better track the particle movements, each particle has an ID which corresponds to the rank of the process in which it started. After each step, each cell prints the IDs of the particles stored in it.p  precodeinclude ltmpi.hgt include ltvectorgt include ltiostreamgt include ltrandomgt include ltstringgt include ltsstreamgt

Negative 290 pI would like to draw a scene to the default framebuffer, while also drawing some auxiliary data related to some of my drawn models to an offscreen buffer with the same image dimensions as the default framebuffer.p  pI understand I can do these two things separately, in two glDraw calls one rendering to an FBO, one not that will use two appropriate shader programs.p  pAnd I think still learning about this I can do them emmostlyem simultaneously, by attaching two renderbufferstextures to one FBO, doing one glDraw call with one shader program whose fragment shader will write appropriate values to multiple outputs corresponding to the multiple FBO attachments, and finally copying one of the two images in the FBO to the default framebuffer, by using it to texture a scenefilling quad or by calling glBlitFramebuffer.p  pBut can I make one glDraw call, with one shader program, and have my fragment shader write both to the visible framebuffer and some offscreen FBO  I am suspecting not, from what Ive seen of the relevant documentation, but Im not certain.p

Negative 290 pIm relatively new to the PayPal API. Im looking for a way to achieve preapproval process like gas stations. I dont know if its possible. Please give me some ideas good folksp  pProblem In a transaction at time emt0em, payment sender commits and preapproves payment up to emXem maximum to receiver at emt1em where emt0em lt emt1em. Depending on actual usage, the amount charged to the senders account at emt1em is emYem where emYem lt emXem. p  pExample I walk into a typical US gas station to prepay for 40 worth of gas. I may end up only filling 30 worth, so my account is only charged 30 after the fill.p  pQ Is the Adaptive Preapproval payment sufficient to achieve this Do I need to go through a special authorization process to obtain privilege for using this APIp  pMany thanks you good folksp

Negative 290 pIm working on a project where I want to redirect ethernet traffic through another interface. The setup is as followp  pI have a computer with a working internet connection. I also have a MBED LPC1768 board which I can connect by USB with my computer. I can upload a binary file to this device and run it. For example, I can let it act as a keyboard and send key strokes to the computer. I can also let the device act as a mouse and send mouse events.p  pNow I want the device to act as an ethernet interface. Since the device is connected using USB, I was thinking about an ethernetoverUSB protocol. Ive chosen for the USBCDCECM protocol which works on Linux and OS X. When plugging in the device, the device is correctly identified as an ethernet interface. Moreover, I run a DHCP server on the embedded device so the computer gets assigned an IP address. Note that the device does not have a working internet connection to the outside world the computer does have one.p  pSo the embedded device can capture internet traffic from the computer. When the device gets an packet, I want to analyze the packet, send it back to the computer and have it redirected through the working interface. p  pSo for example, I have a laptop and a working connection on interface codewlan0code. Now I plug in the device. It gets assigned to interface codeeth0code. codeeth0code is my preferred interface on the computer so all traffic goes to codeeth0code. I capture this traffic on the device and now I want to send the traffic back to the computer and route it over codewlan0code or any other working interface. So basically, I want to create a device that captures data and send it back to the computer, acting like a middleware USB device for internet traffic.p  pIs this possible to do I prefer to not modify settings on the OS and let the device manage it. My primary OS is Ubuntu 14.04 so I do not care about Windows or OS X at the moment. Also, are there any alternatives to do this Maybe USBCDCECM is not the best choice for this.p  pAny help would be highly appreciated.p

Negative 290 pIve got a pile of data in one worksheet that I am trying to save to individual workbooks based on values in several columns. The approach I am taking for better or worse is to copy the relevant worksheet and macros to a new workbook, save it with an appropriate name lets say codetemp.xlsxcode, and then to cleanse the data in that new workbook by deleting irrelevant rows function called codedeleteInfocode. This all has to be done without altering the original workbook, as per company policy.p  pI can copy the stuff over no problem, but Im having serious issues calling macros in the new workbook then.p  pI have triedp  precodeApplication.Run temp.xlsxdeleteInfo  ActiveWorkbook.Application.Run deleteInfo  Application.Run Cuser.....temp.xlsxdeleteInfo codepre  pBut none have worked.p

For example, a fairly big test class with 50 test methods takes something around 130m including context initialisation time to run. p  pOur basic Dev VM is something likep  ul liDualCore i5 processor with HyperThreading, so 4 virtual threadsli li8GB RAMli liMid Range, SATA HDD 5k or 7k2 RPMli liWindows 7 x64 running strongOracle JDK on Client modestrong clientli ul  pWe use Jenkins as our CI server and Maven 3.2 takes care of the build process.

Negative 290 pThis is not really a question, but more my solution after searching extensively and not finding the solution anywhere at least not directly. Hereafter I have written my situationproblem and the way I solved this, in the hope I can help others with the same problem. If you have any recommendations on fixing the problem in a better way, please let me knowp  pI had a slideshow using Slick Carousel and the Foundation Interchange responsive image functionality. However, for design purposes I did not use imgelements but divelements as slides which got a backgroundimage attribute assigned by Interchangep  precodeltdiv classparentgt   ltdiv classslide datainterchange[...]gtltdivgt    more divs... ltdivgt codepre  pOn some screen sizes or at some low connections the images would take some time to load, at which point I got the typical lineperline revelation of the image. Instead of this I wanted to have the image wait until fully loaded and then fade in. This turned out to be not so simple due to the combination of using a slideshow, interchange and divs as images, at least not to me, being a starting developer.p  pAfter extensive research and trialanderror, I have finally figured out a working solution with javascriptp  precodedocument.onreplace, function e, newpath, originalpath     var url  newpath.scenario[0]   var img  new Image   img.src  url    img.onload  function     .parent.animateopacity 1, 600       ifimg.complete      img.onload    else      .parent.cssopacity 0      codepre  pShort explanation from what I understand On every instance page load, resize,  the Interchange functionality triggers a replace. Upon this replace the url of the currently active image is used to make a new Image object. Onload of this image object meaning that the asset file has been downloaded the slideshow will fade in by changing the opacity to 1 with the initial opacity of the .parent div being 0. I have included the elsestatement so that when a new image is delivered at resize past a breakpoint the slideshow is first hidden after which it fades in again, but only after full load.p
Negative 290 pIm really new to programming and I know this may be the simplest of questions, but I wish to know how this would impact my coding when handling large volumes of data, and how I would construct my logic argumentsp  pTwo questionsp  p1 What are the main differences between IFELSE and Select CASE Does select case operate by evaluating all cases at the same timep  pIf I have a situation where, by nature of its construction, need to fulfill two or more cases at the same time, for e.g.p  precodeint  5 Select case int Case gt0 Case 5 Case lt0 codepre  pWhere I would need to trigger both Cases 1 and 2 for action, do I use CASE over IF ELSEp  p2 Now for the other case, if I have a variable that will trigger more one case but I would like to restrict to only one case by priority, say I would only like Case 1 for action and exclude the rest, am I right to say that IFELSE would triumph in this regardp  pEDIT  I realized that my question was phrased poorly.

Negative 290 pI want to allow users to search a sqlitebacked music database. The search should include both, artist and song title, and should be wordbased search for one or more wordprefixes and caseinsensitive. The solution should only use plain SQL, as it needs to work with different language bindings.p  pFor example Searching for hea should find both, Heart of Gold and Stairway to Heaven, but day wont find Yesterday. p  pCombining search terms should find only entries that contain both word prefixes e.g. hea led will only find Stairway to Heaven from Led Zeppelin.p  pSo how do I build the database in order to perform efficient queries and how should the language independent queries look likep  pI read about the a hrefhttpswww.sqlite.orgoptoverview.htmllikeopt relnofollowlike optimizationa of sqlite. I can perform efficient like queries, if there is an index on a column, and I query for a prefix. As I want to find all world of both, the title and the artist, I thought about a table with two columns one for words, and one for the corresponding index of the music table. When building the search index I would extract all worlds from the artist and title and create a new row in the query table for it. p  pWhat do you think about this approach Will it work It would lead to much duplicate entries for both, common words and words of artist names. But I dont care much about diskspace efficiency, if it leads to a better performance.p  pWhen I search for a single word prefix, I could create a query likep  precodeSELECT id from querytable where word like prefix codepre  pBut how can I generate a reliable and fast query when I search for e.g. 5 word prefixesp

Negative 290 pJust a heads up, I am new to how most of this works, so sorry in advance if it is a simple subject.p  pI am trying to setup a simple RESTful site using basic auth for logins with Flask. I have a page adminpanel that requires me to login and a login page login. If I go to the adminpanel, the browser make a pop up which allows me to enter my username and password. Once verified I believe it stores a token so that when I go to other pages I dont need to login again.

Say in another table codeScode, I have each IDvalue mapped to a string.    p  pSo ... lets say in codeScode we have       p  precode Table S  ID     Name   90     node 90  301    node 301    etc. even though the real names are different  codepre  pIs it possible to add a computed column here in codeTcode which gives for each child node, the textual representation of the path all the way up to the root of the tree in an appended form e.g.  p  pnode 1  node 2  node 3 for childleaf node 3 p  porp  pnode 10  node 20  for childleaf node 20 p  pIf its not possible through a computed column, then can I do it with a regular column and a onetime update of that column I was thinking of some recursive CTE but I cannot get my head around it for now. p  precodeTable T    ParentEventID   ChildEventID 90  301 90  302 90  303 90  304 90  305 90  306 90  307 301 401 301 402 302 403 302 404 302 405 302 406 302 407 303 408 304 409 304 410 304 411 304 412 304 413 304 414 305 415 305 416 305 417 305 418 306 419 306 420 306 421 306 422 307 423 307 424 307 425 307 426 307 427 403 501 403 502 403 503 403 504 403 505 404 506 404 507 404 508 404 509 404 510 405 511 405 512 405 513 405 514 405 515 406 516 406 517 406 518 406 519 406 520 407 521 407 522 407 523 407 524 407 525 415 526 415 527 415 528 415 529 415 530 416 531 416 532 416 533 416 534 416 535 417 536 417 537 417 538 417 539 417 540 418 541 418 542 418 543 418 544 418 545 420 546 420 547 420 548 420 549 420 550 421 551 421 552 421 553 421 554 421 555 422 556 422 557 422 558 422 559 422 560 codepre  pAny help is much appreciated.   p

Negative 290 pIve written a small program with the boost asio library to transfer files via TCP from a server to one or more clients.p  pDuring testing I found out that the transfer is extremely slow, about 10KiBs. Nagles algorithm is already disabled. If I transfer the same file via FileZilla from the same server to the same client, I get about 280KiBs, so obviously something was very wrong.p  pMy approach so far was to fragment each file into smaller packets of 1024 bytes, send one fragmenteach fragment1 asyncwritecall to the client and wait for the clients response. I need to fragment the data to allow the client to keep track of the download progress and speed. In retrospect I suppose this was rather nave, because the server has to wait for the clients response after each fragment. To check if this was the bottleneck, Ive increased the fragment size twice, giving me the following resultsp  precodea Fragment Size 1024bytes Transfer Speed 10KiBs b Fragment Size 8192bytes Transfer Speed 80KiBs c Fragment Size 20000bytes Transfer Speed 195KiBs codepre  pThe results speak for themselves, but Im unsure what to do now.p  pIm not too familiar with how the data transfer is actually handled internally, but if Im not mistaken all of my data is basically added onto a stream If thats the case, do I need to worry about how much data I write to that stream at once Does it make a difference at all whether I use multiple writecalls with small fragments as opposed to one writecall with a large fragment Are there any guidelines for thisp

Negative 290 pI have created an Android app based on Chris Banes a hrefhttpsgithub.comchrisbanescheesesquare relnofollowCheesesquarea demo. Instead of having RecyclerViews on one of the fragments inside of the ViewPager, I have a TextView and a NestedScrollView with some scrollable text inside it. When I scroll through the content on the fragments with only the RecyclerView on them, the toolbar collapses properly. On the fragment with the TextView, the toolbar doesnt collapse. If I remove the TextView from the fragment so I just have a NestedScrollView, then scrolling on the fragment will correctly collapse the toolbar.p  pHere is the CoordinatorLayoutp  precodeltandroid.support.design.widget.CoordinatorLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid xmlnsapphttpschemas.android.comapkresauto androidididmaincontent androidlayoutwidthmatchparent androidlayoutheightmatchparentgt  ltandroid.support.design.widget.AppBarLayout     androidididappbar     androidlayoutwidthmatchparent     androidlayoutheightwrapcontent     androidthemestyleThemeOverlay.AppCompat.Dark.ActionBargt      ltandroid.support.v7.widget.Toolbar         androidididtoolbar         androidlayoutwidthmatchparent         androidlayoutheightattractionBarSize         androidbackgroundattrcolorPrimary         apppopupThemestyleThemeOverlay.AppCompat.Light         applayoutscrollFlagsscrollenterAlways gt      ltandroid.support.design.widget.TabLayout         androidididtabs         androidlayoutwidthmatchparent         androidlayoutheightwrapcontent gt  ltandroid.support.design.widget.AppBarLayoutgt  ltandroid.support.v4.view.ViewPager     androidididviewpager     androidlayoutwidthmatchparent     androidlayoutheightmatchparent     applayoutbehaviorstringappbarscrollingviewbehavior gt ltandroid.support.design.widget.CoordinatorLayoutgt codepre  pHere is the layout for the fragment where scrolling collapse is not workingp  precodeltRelativeLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid xmlnstoolshttpschemas.android.comtools androidlayoutwidthfillparent androidlayoutheightfillparent gt  ltTextView     androidididheader     androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent     androidlayoutheightwrapcontent     androidtextHeader     androidlayoutmargin15dpgt  ltView androidlayoutbelowidheader     androidididheaderbar     androidlayoutwidthfillparent     androidlayoutheight1dip     androidbackground000000gt  ltandroid.support.v4.widget.NestedScrollView     androidlayoutwidthmatchparent     androidlayoutheightfillparent     androidlayoutbelowidheaderbar     gt     ltTextView         androidlayoutwidthmatchparent         androidlayoutheightwrapcontent         androidtextLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. ...gt ltandroid.support.v4.widget.NestedScrollViewgt codepre  pp  pIve spent some time troubleshooting this and it looks like the issue lies in the layout behavior on the AppBarLayout.

The reason is that the height of the scroll view must be greater than or equal to the height of the coordinatorLayout  the height of the AppBarLayout. If the scroll view has no siblings, then this will be the case, but if you add any other views to the layout, then it evaluates false and scrolling behavior is deactivated.p  pI have worked around this by returning true instead and it seems to fix the problem. I am wondering if anyone else has run into this and has any better solutions.p

My problem is, however, that the query is very slow. If I only run the subselect, it takes less than a second, and grouping 50 rows should be fast, but when I run the entire query it takes about 10 seconds My guess is that sql server does the select and grouping first, and afterwards does the top 50 and top 1, which in this case leads to terrible performance.p  pSo, how can I rewrite the query to be efficient  p

For example, the ID of my  button is addbutton in the XML, but when I try to write  codecase R.id.addButtoncode, I receive an error but codecase R.id.addbuttoncode doesnt return an error.p  precodeimport android.app.Activity import android.content.DialogInterface import android.os.Bundle import android.view.Menu import android.view.MenuItem import android.view.View import android.widget.Button import android.widget.EditText import android.widget.TextView   public class MainActivity extends Activity implements View.OnClickListener       Button addButton     Button subtractButton     Button multiplyButton     Button divideButton     TextView editText     EditText number1     EditText number2       Override     protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState          super.onCreatesavedInstanceState         setContentViewR.layout.activitymain          addButtonButtonfindViewByIdR.id.addbutton         multiplyButtonButtonfindViewByIdR.id.multiplybutton         subtractButtonButtonfindViewByIdR.id.subtractbutton         divideButtonButtonfindViewByIdR.id.dividebutton          editTextTextViewfindViewByIdR.id.dispNum         number1EditTextfindViewByIdR.id.num1         number2EditTextfindViewByIdR.id.num2           addButton.setOnClickListenerthis         multiplyButton.setOnClickListenerthis         subtractButton.setOnClickListenerthis         divideButton.setOnClickListenerthis           public void onClickView v          int num10,num20,result0          num1Integer.parseIntnumber1.getText.toString         num2Integer.parseIntnumber2.getText.toString          switchv.getId             case R.id.addButton                 resultnum1num2                 break             case R.id.subtractbutton                 resultnum1num2                 break             case R.id.multiplybutton                 resultnum1num2                 break             case R.id.dividebutton                 resultnum1num2                 break             default                 break                   editText.setTextresult       codepre  pThis is the XML file     p  precodeltLinearLayout     androidlayoutwidthmatchparent     androidlayoutheightwrapcontent     androidorientationhorizontalgt  ltEditText     androidlayoutweight1     androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent     androidlayoutheightwrapcontent     androidhintstringnum1     androidgravitycenter     androidididnum1gt ltEditText     androidlayoutweight1     androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent     androidlayoutheightwrapcontent     androidhintstringnum2     androidgravitycenter     androidididnum2gt  ltLinearLayoutgt  ltLinearLayout     androidlayoutwidthmatchparent     androidlayoutheightwrapcontent     androidpaddingTop20dpgt      ltButton         androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent         androidlayoutheightwrapcontent         androidlayoutweight1         androidtext         androidididaddbuttongt      ltButton         androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent         androidlayoutheightwrapcontent         androidlayoutweight1         androidtext         androidididsubtractbuttongt      ltButton         androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent         androidlayoutheightwrapcontent         androidlayoutweight1         androidtext         androidididmultiplybuttongt      ltButton         androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent         androidlayoutheightwrapcontent         androidlayoutweight1         androidtext         androidididdividebuttongt ltLinearLayoutgt  ltTextView     androidlayoutwidthmatchparent     androidlayoutheightwrapcontent     androidpadding30dp     androidgravitycenter     androidtextSize24dp     androidididdispNumgt codepre  pp  pThanks for any help in advancep
Negative 290 pI have a very interesting issue, using CKEDITOR. Im doing the followingp  pI have an instance of CKEDITOR, and I have a form with hidden inputs. Before submitting the form, the value of CKEDITOR is entered in a hidden input field. So I have p  precodeformhiddeninput.valCKEDITOR.instances.editor.getData   codepre  pWhen posting so submitting the form, I am able, to access the value of the input with codePOST[formhiddeninput]code. So far, so good. But when I now try, to insert the value I got into CKEDITOR again, it fails. What I do is p  precodeCKEDITOR.instances.editor.insertHtmlltPOST[formhiddeninput]gt codepre  pWhen I echo the content of codePOST[formhiddeninput]code everything seems to be fine, but with insertHtml, I get a Uncaught SyntaxError Unexpected token ILLEGAL, in Sources of of Developer Console or when clicking on the error, the line looks like thatp  precodeCKEDITOR.instances.editor.insertHtmlltpgtasfaltpgt  codepre  pBe aware, that codecode appears in the next line, anyway it should work, but I think, this is the only point, where the problem could appear...

Negative 290 pThere is a .Net Autocad plugin in which a WCF service is used to call a method on another process external to Autocad. Autocad entities are wrapped in custom classes and passed through WCF. Once the call returns the plugin needs to write the result back into Autocad database.p  pHere is the problem ObjectId is needed to fetch the object and write the result back WCF serialize the data and ObjectId is not serializable. So I dont have access to the object.p  pIs there any workaroundsolution for thisp

I have just joined a new team and therefore I am working on an existing code base. I am trying to get a feel for best practices.p  pAlso in PyCharm, modules written in .pyx files are show as unresolved references in the editor  I have just read about pyximport but I am not sure if PyCharm is set up correctly for cython I have the latest professional edition.p  pI am aware of the a hrefhttpdocs.cython.orgsrcuserguide relnofollowcython user guidea but I cannot find advice on testing. I am also aware of a hrefhttpwww.jetbrains.compycharmhelpcythonsupport.html relnofollowpycharms setup guidea but this suggests that cython support is out of the box, which seems to contradict what I experience.p

Negative 290 pIm trying to use AJAX to bring in some data and then modify it before sending the result to a controller. I had this all working in the controller but I was told that its better to do it in a service.p  precodeapp.factoryGameweekJsonFactory, [http,functionhttp             var promise             var service                   async function                      if  promise                           promise  http.getjsonsgameweeks.json.thenfunctionresponse                     return response.data                                                               return promise                                           return service         ] codepre  pThen in another factory I wanted to change the value of a variable dependent on the response of the AJAX call. Say for example if its gameweek 6 going by date, I want gwk to equal 6.p  precodeapp.factoryGameweekFactory,[GameweekJsonFactory,functionGameweekJsonFactory     var gwk    var obj          foo function             GameweekJsonFactory.async.thenfunctiond                 Code here to find out the current gameweek.                 gwk  6                 return gwk                                return gwk ]   controller functionGameweekFactory             console.logController Log GameweekFactory , codepre  pHow do I then modify the original gwk variable in the factorys scope I cant work it out and Ive been googling for agesp
Negative 290 pIm attempting to create a charting solution that takes series of data with multiple ranges and placing it into a range column chart. Each range in each column will have custom formatting as dictated by data coming from the database. To assist with visualizing what Im describing, heres a simple mockup of a column in the chart a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comAK9tn.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comAK9tn.png altRange Column MockUpap  pThe gaps between each range of data in the column is intentional as there will only be data for specific depth ranges. Is there a solution that will allow me to implement this using ASP.NET MVC 5 I am open to other charting solutions that will allow for customization of each range. Its also important that it allow me to place text on each range as I need to overlay the range with either a background color as shown above or with an Interdex Hatch Pattern font. p

Negative 290 pI have a web application which appears to be suffering from Sessions being locked for apparent random requests. Im aware of the limitations of sessions, that they are locked to make them threadsafe, so concurrent sessions are unavailable with the .Net session provider.p  pMy question however relates to the creation of threads within the TreadPool. My web application does a lot of background tasks which are sometimes triggered indirectly by user requests.p  pIve recently noticed that creating threads within the ThreadPool retains access to the users session which I suspect is causing the random session locking experienced on the site ie. the user cannot make any further subsequent requests until the initial request has completed and released the session. I have proved access to the session is possible by doing the following in a sample page and making multiple requests to see the results of the session variables changed via a thread, which it does.p  precodeprotected void PageLoadobject sender, EventArgs e    if Session[Cow]  null     Session[Cow]  Moo   ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItemx gt  threadedMethod    Response.WritestringSession[Cow]   private void threadedMethod     Detect if this has access to session   Session[Cow]  Grass   new Random.Next100  codepre  pWhen I create threads, I had previously assumed that session data was unable to be accessed Now I realise that this is automatically loaded if available, and is causing the session locking problems as a result.p  pDoes anyone know how to prevent the thread from being passed session and other client related details with the aim to prevent any Session locking problems that it may causep
