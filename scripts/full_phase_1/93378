Positive 93378 pSo I have multiple intranet website projects in one solution. All .net 4.6 MVC 5.

Bootstrap, jQuery, etc As well as several universal apps that deal with the other stuff Email queueing, Security, etc p  pI have been investigating the bundling feature again. I ditched it originally because it was across projects and it didnt like it. However Ive started looking again, and I love the minification only on release mode and separate files in debug mode  great. However across project I have to reference the bundles with a url which always minify and are cached to the point where the project needs rebuilding to update the css. This is playing havoc with my attempts to update styles and expect it to work with BrowserLink.p  pId rather not go back to an ugly list of links that change with debug mode or not, is there a way of bundling files from another project in the same solution, or from another URL in release modep

Positive 93378 pI have an asp.net mvc application that authenticates calls into another service.  In the event of a timeout or hitting a rate limit I want to retry the call.

I want to write to a log anytime a retry occurs with what the method being retried is and how many times weve tried.

This makes no sense to me given that when the first method is called loading the View for the first time, this linep  pcodevar thisRole  context.Roles.Wherer gt r.Name.EqualsRole, StringComparison.CurrentCultureIgnoreCase.FirstOrDefaultcodep  preturns the selected role out of the several that exist and that I can see when I add to watch codecontext.Rolescode. However, after the view is loaded, the textbox edited and the second method in the controller gets called, codecontext.Rolescode has nothing in it. Whyp

Negative 93378 pA coworker and I are disagreeing on this.  He thinks we have licenses for SQL Developer because we purchased VS 2005 Professional.  Its been a while since Ive installed it but I dont recall that being part of the installation whatsoever.  Its always been a separate install and license.  Been to the MS VS site and cant find anything about it coming with SQL Server anywhere.  I think he is referring to the MS launch events where VS and SQL came in a pack together as part of the launch.p  pAnyone know for sure  Thanks in advance.p  pI should add that there is a difference between sql express and sql developer.

Negative 93378 pGiven that Flex is still a relatively young technology, there are already a bunch of architectural frameworks available for FlexAIR and Flash development, the main ones being Cairngorm and PureMVC. The amount of architectural frameworks is remarkable compared to other technologies.p  pstrongI was wondering how many of you use an architectural framework for Flex development. If so, why, or why not if you dont use anystrongp  phr p  pTo share my own experience and point of view I have used Cairngorm and ARP for Flash development on a variety of projects and found that at times, we needed to write extra code just to fit into the framework, which obviously didnt feel right. Although I havent used PureMVC on many occasions, I have the same gut feeling after looking at the examples applications.p  pArchitectural frameworks equal religion in some way. Most followers are convinced that their framework is THE framework and are not open or very skeptical when it comes to using other frameworks. I also find myself hesitant and skeptical to check out new frameworks, but that is mainly because I would rather wait until the hype is over.p  pIn conclusion, Im thinking that it is better to have a sound knowledge of patterns and practices that you can apply in your application instead of choosing a framework and sticking to it. There is simply no right or wrong and I dont believe that there will ever be a framework that is considered the holy grail.p

Negative 93378 pIm developing an ASP.NET MVC application where the content for any page can be pulled from the database, if it exists, and displayed on the page.p  pThis is to make it possible for nontechnical persons to edit the content without having to go into the source code e.g. views and change things.p  pThe way Im doing this is, each controller derives from a base controller. The base controller  overloads OnActionExecuted and takes this opportunity to pull any content assigned to the current ActionController.p  pIf the action returns a ViewModel that derives from ContentViewModel, it populates the  Text property of the ViewModel with the text from the database.p  pAnd then the text gets rendered by the View.p  pCan you see any weakness to this designp  pWould it be better if, rather than having a base controller, I had HtmlHelper extensions for pulling content, which I call from the Viewp  pOne reason Im asking this is, having my own base controller seems to interfere with calling Html.RenderAction, which seems to expect the specified controller to directly inherit from System.Web.Mvc.Controller.p

Negative 93378 pIm implementing localization in my WCF application according to a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comKBWCFWSI18N.aspx relnofollowhttpwww.codeproject.comKBWCFWSI18N.aspxa and some other articles. Basicly Im attaching a message header with current culture info on client using IClientMessageInspector implementation and then applying the culture info on current thread on server side using ICallContextInitializer implementation. The probem Im currently facing is that my implementation of ICallContextInitializer isnt probably the best place to actually change the Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture according to message header, because resetting the threads culture in AfterInvoke occurs before other things which should still be in localized context. Currently Ive problem with IErrorHandler implementation  its called after ICallContextInitializer.AfterInvoke so the thread is already reset back to default culture and so I cant work with localized resources in my IErrorHandler.p  pIs there any better extension place than ICallContextInitializer I could use for localization based on message header Or better  is there any article describing execution sequence in WCF Id like to understand the sequence in which are different extension points processed...p  hr  pThe problem is solved, but Id like to get more information about WCF internal execution sequence etc  any tips what to read on this topicp
Negative 93378 pI seem to have a weird bug in Microsoft SQL Server 2005 where codeFREETEXTcode searches are somewhat casesensitive despite the collation being caseinsensitive codeLatin1GeneralCIAScode.p  pFirst of, codeLIKEcode queries are perfectly caseinsensitive, so p  precodeWHERE column LIKE word codepre  pandp  precodeWHERE column LIKE Word codepre  preturn the same results.p  pAlso, codeFREETEXTcode are infact caseinsensitive to some extent, for instancep  precodeWHERE FREETEXTcolumn, Word codepre  pwill return results with different cases.p  pBUTp  precodeWHERE FREETEXTcolumn, word codepre  pwhile still returning caseinsensitive matches for codewordcode, gives a different resultset.

Negative 93378 pI am using jQuery for a simple website and have a main page index.html which can load some content e.g. info1.html or info2.html via jQuery ajax requests, and display the result of these requests inside an element in the index.html page.p  pIf a user somehow visits say info1.html directly, is their a way to redirect or load the main index.html page or whats best practice for this type of thing as Google is indexing all the small html files used for the ajax requests and sometimes a user can click into the site via these pages.p  pThanks.p

Negative 93378 pI have a whole series of commands that I need to run on login, many of which require root privileges.

Negative 93378 pIve recently refactored my application with the following Linq to SQL db connection Objects to wrap the linq to sql classes Mappers to map back and forth between objects and Linq to Sql entitys Service layer to call the repository, handing up objects to the UI. p  pBefore I was just using Linq to SQL objects in my UI I know. But when displaying relations it was so easy. For instancep  pI have a able called SchoolProfile, and a table called School. A user has a SchoolProfile with GPA, Rank, etc.. , which links to a School. The School adding functionality was easy  because it has no foreign keys.p  pWhen creating a form for a user to list all SchoolProfiles  they dont want to see a SchoolId. Before in my view it would simply be schoolprofile.School.Name. Now a ShoolProfile is a flat object in my ViewData with no properties.

Negative 93378 pI am somewhat new to using JPA  Ill put that out there right off the bat.

However, the application also links into a thirdparty application, and I would like to add logic that gets executed whenever a certain type of Entity is removed from the persistence layer.p  pMy question is this.

Negative 93378 pAll,p  pIm working on a Flash AS2 project in which I have a choice of receiving a dataset in either XML or JSON.p  pThe dataset is probably about 1001,000 rows of data each row has roughly 50 fields most values are numeric.p  pIf I use XML, Ill be able to define the XML myself, to make sure its as compact as possible.p  pSo, I could use something like thisp  precodeltrowsgt     ltrow col01 col12 col23 ... col4950 gt     ...     ltrow col01 col12 col23 ... col4950 gt ltrowsgt codepre  pIn my initial tests, both the JSON and XML data weigh about the same in kbytes. However, I notice that Flash is able to parse the XML MUCH faster  it takes about 3x as long to parse the JSON. Im using the class from a hrefhttpwww.json.orgjson.as relnofollowhttpwww.json.orgjson.asa.p  pBased solely on that, Im inclined to use XML, even though JSON seems to be the much more popular choice these days.p  pIs the slower JSON parsing typical Is there a faster class than the one from json.org Is this because Im using AS2 instead of AS3 long story, dont ask...

Negative 93378 pI want to use a WebSocket to transfer binary data, but you can only use WebSockets to transfer UTF8 strings.p  pEncoding it using base64 is one option, but my understanding is that base64 is most desirable when your text might be converted from one format to another. In this case, I know the data will always be UTF8, so is there a better way of encoding binary data in a UTF8 string without paying base64s 33 size premiump  pThis question is mostly academic, as binary support will probably be added to WebSocket eventually, and base64 is a perfectly cromulent alternative in the meantime.p

Negative 93378 pWe are trying to Integrate SQLite in our Application and are trying to populate as a Cache. We are planning to use it as a In Memory Database. Using it for the first time. Our Application is C based.p  pOur Application interacts with the Master Database to fetch data and performs numerous operations. These Operations are generally concerned with one Table which is quite huge in size. We replicated this Table in SQLite and following are the observationsp  pNumber of Fields 60 Number of Records 1,00,000p  pAs the data population starts, the memory of the Application, shoots up drastically to 1.4 GB from 120MB. At this time our application is in idle state and not doing any major operations. But normally, once the Operations start, the Memory Utilization shoots up. Now with SQLite as in Memory DB and this high memory usage, we dont think we will be able to support these many records. p  pWhen I create the DB on Disk, the DB size sums to 40MB. But still the Memory Usage of the Application remains very high.p  pemstrongQ. Is there a reason for this high usage. All buffers have been cleared and as said before the DB is not in memoryemstrongp  pAny help would be deeply appreciated.p  pThanks and Regards Sachinp

Im hoping there is a way to get around this so I can set the ob handlers settings up how I want them to without actually needing to edit a configuration file.p  pIm sure my hosting will be willing to edit Tidys configuration file if needed, but Id rather not add to the barrage of support tickets Ive been sending them for various reasons as it is.p  pIf I need to create my own callback for output buffering I can do so I see some possibly useful methods using the OO approach to tidy but Id rather have it as slim as possible.p  pThanks for any inputp
Negative 93378 pI have 2 applications.First one is a web application through which we provision reference data.Second one is an ESB based application where the reference data is used.The reference data changes but not very frequently.We needed to cache the reference data.The web application I am not the owner used hibernate. But my ESB based application did not.We only used EHCache. When reference data is changed by the independent web application that needs to be reflected in ESB application.We implemented using message queue  that is when reference data changes web application sends a message to the message queue.Our ESB application listens to that message amp clears the cache amp caches the data once again.This works.But it is time intensive.How can I use Hibernate to improve the situationp  pRegards, Subhendup

Negative 93378 psorry if this issues been asked before but I couldnt find a reference to it, trying to start using andEngine and Im trying to use an image 3360x720, because its tiled with 7 columns.

Ive tested this out by resizing my image to 1024x720, 2048x720, and again to 4096x720. Kept my sprite size the same as 480x720 camera size and it worked just fine for any number of columns for the first two, but the 4096px simply shows the white screen. Oh well, if someone finds a way around this please let me know, as for now Ill probably just manually adjust my animation src image manually.p  pIve since found that when your texture gets above 1024x1024 you run the risk of it not being displayed, assuming each phone is different with this. So instead Im simply slowing down the framerate a bunch and using a smaller image to tile from.p

Negative 93378 pI have a Linux binary, without sources, that works on one machine, and Id like to make a selfcontained package that would run on a different machine of the same architecture. What is a way of achieving thisp  pIn my case, both machines have the same architecture, same Ubuntu kernel, but target machine doesnt have codemakecode and has wrong version of files under codelibcode and codeusrcodep  pOne idea I had was to use codechrootcode and recreate a subset of the filesystem that the binary uses, possibly using codestracecode to figure out what it needs.

The interpreter is hardcoded into the binary. One approach might be to patch the interpreter and run the binary as codepatchedinterpreter mycommandlinecode Problem is that when codemycommandlinecode is starts with codejavacode, this doesnt work because Java setsup codeLDLIBRARYPATHcode and restarts itself, which resorts to the old interpreter. A solution that worked for me was to open the binary in the text editor, find the interpreter codelibldlinuxx8664.so.2code, and replace it with samelength path to the patched interpreterp

Negative 93378 pCurrently we have a very simple but effective release process. We tag a new version in SVN. This version will is exported to a test environment. From there we rsync to the Acceptance environment and from there to Production. p  pNow we want to start minifying css and js files. I wanted to do this minifying on our testenvironment in the process of releasing to Acceptance, so that both on the Acceptance environment and Production environment we have minified files. However, if I minify the files there, the timestamps change, and rsync will every time transfer ALL css and js files, even though the minified content hasnt changed. p  pMy question is what is best practice to solve this  Should I use a different mechanism than rsync to release a new version  Should I put the minified versions in SVN already But I dont want minified files in development, so what is the best moment to minify and possibly combine them p  pWe use PHP 5.3.6 and I started looking at Yuicompressor because I can easily use it in scripts. p

Negative 93378 pin my nib file I have a UIImageView that I have linked to my variable codeIBOutlet UIImageView imgH6code  I need to play several animations therefore I have decided to play them on imgH6. for example if I want to start animating a group of images I will do code[self playAnimation1]codep  precodevoid playAnimation1     NSArray imagesArrayDilema     imagesArrayDilema  [NSArray arrayWithObjects                                  [UIImage imageNameddilema102.png],                                   [UIImage imageNameddilema103.png],                                   [UIImage imageNameddilema104.png],                                   [UIImage imageNameddilema105.png]                                    .....                                   there are several images                                  , nil]     imgH6.animationImages  imagesArrayDilema      I will then start the animation as    wait  double[imgH6.animationImages count]30    [imgH6 setAnimationRepeatCount1]    imgH6.animationDuration  wait    [imgH6 startAnimating]     void playAnimation2     NSArray imagesArrayDilema     imagesArrayDilema  [NSArray arrayWithObjects                                  [UIImage imageNameddifferentImage01.png],                                   [UIImage imageNameddifferentImage02.png],                                   [UIImage imageNameddifferentImage03.png],                                   [UIImage imageNameddifferentImage04.png],                                    .....                                   there are several images                                  , nil]     imgH6.animationImages  imagesArrayDilema      I will then start the animation as    wait  double[imgH6.animationImages count]30    [imgH6 setAnimationRepeatCount1]    imgH6.animationDuration  wait    [imgH6 startAnimating]    .....   ... void playAnimation8  etc... codepre  pso when I call code[self playAnimation1]code there is no problem. the animation animates fine. I may also call code[self playAnimation7]code and a different group of images animate. I am able to do this several times but eventually the application crashes In order to fix this I have done the following  I have a global BOOL variable called isAnimating and what that does is that every time there is an animation in place you will not be able to animate a different group of images until the animation is done. Before I used to have the methodp  precodevoid animateMain NSArray imagesArray         imgH6.animationImages  imagesArray          I will then start the animation as        double wait  double[imgH6.animationImages count]30        [imgH6 setAnimationRepeatCount1]        imgH6.animationDuration  wait        [imgH6 startAnimating]    codepre  pand the application still crashed after playing several times. I have noticed that it crashes when changing the animation several times. In other words if I alway splay the same animation it does not crash...p  palso I do not used the word alloc or init to instantiate the array so I dont think this has to do with releasing the array. p

Negative 93378 pWhat Id like to do is very similar to the ColorNote app. Basically I have app widgets that can launch EditNote activity and I want only one instance of the activity in the task Say if user 1. taps widget A which launches EditNote A, 2. goes to home, 3. taps widget B which launches EditNote B, 4. then taps BACK button, user should land on home screen. I store the rowIds in an sqlite database and pass the row id of interest in the intent to get the EditNote activity. p  pIve tried to set the launchMode to either singleTask or singleInstance, and Android would bypass onCreate and directly call onNewIntent which is expected as its documented, but the problem is each time the EditNote then gets the same intent which contains the same rowId, so step 3 above EditNote A would be launched instead. If the launchMode is set to standard, then the task would contain multiple EditNote activities with the correct ids.p  pThis is the code snippet in the appWidgetProviderp  precodeint rowId  dataAccess.getIdByAppWidgetIdappWidgetId intent.putExtraNoteColumns.ID, IntegerrowId.longValue   PendingIntent pending  PendingIntent.getActivitycontext, appWidgetId,                                  intent, PendingIntent.FLAGUPDATECURRENT views.setOnClickPendingIntentR.id.appwidget, pending appWidgetManager.updateAppWidgetappWidgetId, views codepre  pCode in the EditNote activityp  precodeOverride     protected void onNewIntentIntent intent          Log.dTAG, new intent               the rowId is getIntent.getLongExtraNoteColumns.ID, 1         super.onNewIntentintent      codepre

Negative 93378 pI have a function that listens for focusout event to clear out a form field. This works well by itself. The problem is jQuery Validation plugin binds to focusout event as well to run validations on the field. The validations are always run after I have a chance to clear the field, and so they are always wrong. I am trying to figure out a way to make sure my listener is always executed before the listener for the validation plugin. p  pSo I guess I am wondering if there is a good way of inserting something into a position in the callstack using jQuery Or perhaps to delay the execution of other binded functions until my function gets a chance to run.p

Negative 93378 pI am well aware of the fact that a multitude of similar problems already appeared on this board, however none of the solutions helped me.p  pI am trying to get Eclipse CDT running with MinGW toolchain on Windows 7 Service Pack 1. I already did that on Windows XP and thought that the same procedure will make it run smoothly on Windows 7, but it seems I was mistaken p  pAfter installing MinGW from the automatic installer just in case I installed a few things more than what I needed and adding the CMinGWbin to my PATH environment variable, I tried to compile a simple Hello, World program. Eclipse did not give me any errors, but it didnt want to give any output in the Console window. Alarmed, I tried to run the executable file outside of Eclipse and got the error thatp  pProgram cant start because libstdc6.dll is missing.p  pStrangely enough, this dll is in the CminGWbin directory, so the PATH variable should find it  but it does not. Copying the dll to the directory with the executable file helped, but it is obviously a shortterm solution and I would prefer to have a more normal one.p  pThe thing that makes my problem different, I think, from the others Ive noticed on this board is the fact that, for one, Eclipse does not find any errors with my PATH variable which it usually does, if the MinGW was not included in the Path variable or something, and besides the required dlls are where they should be, but it seems my Windows cant find them.p

Negative 93378 pI am creating a WinForm project that displays messages from a server and a client.  Client messages are added via standard UI events like Click and KeyPress.  Server messages are added via a background thread that is listening for messages and alerts the UI when they arrive.  The alert happens through an EventHandler that then makes use of the Invoke method since we are requesting to modify the UI from a thread that did not create it.p  pWhen messages are added from the client they appear as desired i.e. correctly sized, wrapping and resizing performs correctly.  When messages are added from the background thread via Invoke only the first message displays correctly and even then only initially.  Once the form is resized the wrapping stops working and the first message is clipped based on how much space is available.  Messages after the first get sized completely incorrectly in that it appears that their height gets set to 1 pixel or something very small so that only the tops of the characters from the first line can be seen.  Since I am new to WinForms I am suspicious that I am doing something wrong as far as the correct way to programmatically add controls to the UI.p  pBoth the client and the background thread call the same method to add the controls to the form only the background calls it via Invoke.  I am at a loss as to why the added controls behave differently based on the event they originated from because either way they are being added the exact same way.  My only thought is that I am missing something obvious because I am new to WinForms.p  pAnyway, enough of the explanation, here is the relevant codep  precodeprivate void AddMessagestring message      tableLayoutPanel1.SuspendLayout      RichTextBox rtb  new RichTextBox     rtb.AppendTextmessage     rtb.Multiline  true     rtb.WordWrap  true     rtb.Dock  DockStyle.Top      rtb.ReadOnly  true     rtb.BorderStyle  BorderStyle.None     rtb.ScrollBars  RichTextBoxScrollBars.None     rtb.BackColor  Color.LightBlue     rtb.Font  new FontTahoma, 8, FontStyle.Italic     rtb.Resize  rtbResize     rtb.MinimumSize  new Size150, 15     rtb.Margin  new Padding1, 0, 0, 5     rtb.Padding  new Padding3, 3, 3, 3     rtb.Height  rtb.GetPositionFromCharIndexrtb.Text.Length.Y      tableLayoutPanel1.RowStyles.Addnew RowStyleSizeType.AutoSize     tableLayoutPanel1.RowCount  tableLayoutPanel1.RowStyles.Count     tableLayoutPanel1.Controls.Addrtb     tableLayoutPanel1.SetColumnSpanrtb, 2      tableLayoutPanel1.ResumeLayouttrue     tableLayoutPanel1.AutoScrollPosition  new Point0, tableLayoutPanel1.VerticalScroll.Maximum   private void richTextBox1KeyPressobject sender, KeyPressEventArgs e      if e.KeyChar  13 ampamp String.IsNullOrEmptyrichTextBox1.Text              AddMessagerichTextBox1.Text         richTextBox1.Clear        public void PostMessageobject sender, MessageEventArgs e      BeginInvokenew AddMsgAddMessage, new object[]  e.Message    public delegate void AddMsgstring m  private void rtbResizeobject sender, EventArgs e      var rtb  RichTextBox sender     rtb.Height  rtb.GetPositionFromCharIndexrtb.Text.Length.Y  codepre  pOk, now some more explanation.  Client messages originate from richTextBox1KeyPress and server messages originate from PostMessage PostMessage is assigned to the EventHandler for the background thread when it gets a message.  Both as you can see call AddMessage which adds a RichTextBox with the message to the TableLayoutPanel.  The rtbResize method contains logic for a way I found online to get a RickTextBox to auto size since apparently it does not support this maybe this a possible source to my problem.p  pIll also provide the designer code below for the TableLayoutPanel since this seems to be helpful and relevant from other posts Ive seen on here.p  precode   tableLayoutPanel1   this.tableLayoutPanel1.AutoScroll  true this.tableLayoutPanel1.AutoSize  true this.tableLayoutPanel1.AutoSizeMode  System.Windows.Forms.AutoSizeMode.GrowAndShrink this.tableLayoutPanel1.BackColor  System.Drawing.Color.White this.tableLayoutPanel1.ColumnCount  2 this.tableLayoutPanel1.ColumnStyles.Addnew System.Windows.Forms.ColumnStyleSystem.Windows.Forms.SizeType.Percent, 100F this.tableLayoutPanel1.ColumnStyles.Addnew System.Windows.Forms.ColumnStyleSystem.Windows.Forms.SizeType.Absolute, 50F this.tableLayoutPanel1.Dock  System.Windows.Forms.DockStyle.Fill this.tableLayoutPanel1.Location  new System.Drawing.Point1, 10 this.tableLayoutPanel1.Name  tableLayoutPanel1 this.tableLayoutPanel1.Padding  new System.Windows.Forms.Padding5, 5, 12, 5 this.tableLayoutPanel1.RowCount  1 this.tableLayoutPanel1.RowStyles.Addnew System.Windows.Forms.RowStyle this.tableLayoutPanel1.Size  new System.Drawing.Size272, 276 this.tableLayoutPanel1.TabIndex  0 codepre  pThe TableLayoutPanel does contain an initial row since the designer does not allow you to have one with no rows, but I clear all the rows out in the Forms constructor after the standard call to InitializeComponent.p  pHopefully Ive provided enough here to give people the information they need but please let me know if you have any questions or need to see other parts of the code and I will provide them as quickly as possible.

And the other blackbox is the UIWebView. Nobody knows its internal limitations.p  pI have a few ideas how to optimize JavaScript and HTML aspect. For example Ive optimized structure and reduce memory allocations in scripts as I could. Ive also replaced IMG tags with DIV  backgroundimage. But crashes remains.p  pBelow is the insane solution to the problem.p  pstrongSolutionstrongp  pThere are memory warnings but I can release neither something native nor anything inside JavaScript, I thought. So I decided to do ridiculous thing  to allocate the dummy array of several megabytes and release it on memory warning.

Negative 93378 pIve taken over a wordpress ecomm although this question is more about profiling generally site which has a performance issue which seemingly only affects one specific area in the admin section of the CMS. When trying to edit one particular type of product, which has a large number of attributes attached to it, the page effectively causes the browser to crash 99 of the time. I expected this to be down to MySQL queries causing the bottleneck, however when I profiled the db, I got the following resultsp  pTotal Queries 174  Total Time Of MySQL Queries 0.11370p  pThis suggests the bottleneck is happening elsewhere, but Im not sure where it could be. If I run YSlow on the page, there is nothing drastic there which would explain the issue, although there are around 20 scripts and stylesheets loaded, so some optimisation could be done there. Im going to enable an opcode cache library which will improve PHP performance, but is there anything else I can do to try to identify the issue here Thanks.p

Negative 93378 pI am writing a mobile web application using Rails and jQuery mobile. I am reading all of my data at runtime from Amazon AWS S3 using HTTParty. p  pOne of the screens that I need to render is just straight html, which can and usually does have images embedded into it which are hosted in the same folder on S3. This is where my problem is. I can easily pull in the html with HTTParty and use the htmlsafe option to render it, but the images dont render as they are relative path names. So I have been trying to find a way around this.p  pI have tried multiple things, but I have mainly been looking into using an html  tag to get the images to point to the right location. The problem is that I cant specify a base tag and then have other links on the page, because they then use that same base and the links are not pointing atand the correct location. So I looked into framesets and frame and pointing the base tag only at the frame, which I believe I used correctly, but to no avail. I tried using  but to no avail. p  pSo basically I am looking for a way that I can set the base for relative path names in an html string that I read in from S3, if that wasnt clear. I am open to any suggestions And thanks in advance for even reading and try to solve this very specific problemp  pOh and one more thing, when I look at the page with Firebug, the first line in the header is a base tag with href set to the current page. I cant find out where it is coming from but I am guessing rails is throwing it in there I dont know if this matters since I then put another base tag below it with the yield introbase Or is that one of my problems since there is a conflict there p  pAnd then there was code My intro methodp  precodedef intro intros  [] appconfig.introscreens.each do introscreen   introscreenresponse      ApplicationController.getdiandrurlintroscreen[filename].html   intros ltlt introscreenresponse.body end intros.reverse introslength  intros.length respondto do format   format.html end end codepre  pMy intro.html.erb filep  precodelt pagenum  params[id].toi gt  lt contentfor introbase do gt   ltbase hrefhttpss3.amazonaws.comourbucketnameltdirurlgt targetintro gt lt end gt     lt contentfor mobileheader do gt   some jQuery mobile paging and header stuff is in here, shouldnt matter lt end gt   lt contentfor mobilecontent do gt    lt ltiframe srclt intros[pagenum] gt height100 width100gt  gt   lt   ltpgt This browser does not support iframes ltpgt gt   lt ltiframegt  gt    ltframeset cols100gt     ltframe nameintro lt intros[pagenum].htmlsafe gt   ltframesetgt  lt end gt codepre  pMy layouts header p  precodeltheadgt lttitlegt our Mobile App lttitlegt ltmeta nameviewport contentwidthdevicewidth, initialscale1gt lt These are the jQuery Mobile scripts gt  ltlink relstylesheet hrefhttpcode.jquery.commobile1.0jquery.mobile1.0.min.css gt ltscript typetextjavascript srchttpcode.jquery.comjquery1.6.4.min.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript typetextjavascript srchttpcode.jquery.commobile1.0jquery.mobile1.0.min.jsgt  ltscriptgt lt yield introbase gt lt stylesheetlinktag master gt lt javascriptincludetag defaults gt lt csrfmetatag gt codepre  pp

Negative 93378 pI am trying to scroll my textview using folling codep  precodeTextView text  TextView findViewByIdR.id.textView12         text.setMovementMethodScrollingMovementMethod.getInstance         int height  getResources.getDrawableR.drawable.picgroundpranic.getIntrinsicHeight         text.setLayoutParamsnew FrameLayout.LayoutParamsLayoutParams.FILLPARENT, height         text.setTextAs part of an Android App I am building a button set.For performance reasons and to keep the code simpler, the Android system uses pixels as the standard unit for expressing dimension or coordinate values. That means that the dimensions of a view are always expressed in the code using pixels, but always based on the current screen density. For instance, if myView.getWidth returns 10, the view is 10 pixels wide on the current screen, but on a device with a higher density screen, the value returned might be 15. If you use pixel values in your application code to work with bitmaps that are not prescaled for the current screen density, you might need to scale the pixel values that you use in your code If you need to control exactly how your application will look on various screen configurations, adjust your layouts and bitmap drawables in configurationspecific resource directories. For example, consider an icon that you want to display on medium and high density screens. Simply create your icon at two different sizes for instance 100x100 for medium density and 150x150 for high density and put the two variations in the appropriate directories, using the proper qualifiers For instance, suppose a device has a WVGA highdensity screen, which is 480x800 and about the same size as a traditional HVGA screen, but its running an application that has disabled prescaling. In this case, the system will lie to the application when it queries for screen dimensions, and report 320x533 the approximate mdpi translation for the screen density. Then, when the application does drawing operations, such as invalidating the rectangle from 10,10 to 100, 100, the system transforms the coordinates by scaling them the appropriate amount, and actually invalidate the region 15,15 to 150, 150. This discrepancy may cause unexpected behavior if your application directly manipulates the scaled bitmap, but this is considered a reasonable tradeoff to keep the performance of applications as good as possible. If you encounter this situation, read Based on the density of the current screen, the system uses any size or densityspecific resources from your application and displays them without scaling. If resources are not available in the correct density, the system loads the default resources and scales them up or down as needed to match the current screens density. The system assumes that default resources those from a directory without configuration qualifiers are designed for the baseline screen density mdpi, unless they are loaded from a densityspecific resource directory. Prescaling is, thus, what the system does when resizing a bitmap to the appropriate size for the current screen density. to match the unscaled bitmap source. The buttons are part of a nested set of LinearLayouts.The question then is How to resize the layout.I have tried several suggested techniques, and none come close to working. Here is a subset of the XML that builds the button set codepre  pall is working fine but my text view not scrolling smoothly.

Negative 93378 pIf you have a user entity, you could store hisher address in two ways.

I get that it can be more practical for other things, but the example specifically mentions a situation where you could do either.p  pIs a user something you would generally use an IdClass for, if you did something similar to what Ive described abovep  pFor an IdClass, must EVERY field simply be a key to another entity, or can you have concrete or transient fields there in addition Is usage of IdClass simply saying to expect multiple Id annotations, and the rest is up to youp  pThanksp

Negative 93378 pI have a few files in AppDataRoaming that my app is writing to.

Negative 93378 pAs a developer, if I want each and every vagrant box I build from any repository to include my customisations, how would I achieve thatp  pFor example, I have my own a hrefhttpwww.vim.org relnofollowvima config, my own a hrefhttptmux.sourceforge.net relnofollowtmuxa config, my own a hrefhttpgitscm.com relnofollowgita config, plus there are certain commandline tools I expect on every codeunixcode environment I use, such as the aforementioned plus a hrefhttpcurl.haxx.se relnofollowcurla and a hrefhttpbetterthangrep.com relnofollowacka.p  pI would hope a hrefhttpvagrantup.com relnofollowVagranta would include the ability to customise local versions of checkedout box configurations, but I couldnt find out how to do it.p  pI cant use the normal a hrefhttpvagrantup.comv1docsvagrantfile.html relnofollowVagrantfilea because this comes from the repository. I cant create a custom a hrefhttpvagrantup.comv1docsbaseboxes.html relnofollowbase boxa, because the codeVagrantfilecode that is checkout out from the repository specifies which base box it wants to use.p  pCurrently the best way Ive come up with is to create a a hrefhttpsgithub.comnottrobin.shellconfig relnofollowrepository containing my configsa and set it up when I first log in to a newly built Vagrant box by installing all the software I expect through codeaptgetcode and then importing my configuration files, but clearly this is frustrating if Im building a lot of boxes.p  pDoes anyone know how I can automate thisp

In this way I have a local Customer table and I have no problem making a foreign key column in my Orders.p  pIn future, developing new apps, this strategy will not be a good solution assumed that it is now... For every app, working in this manner, I will have local copy of customer table and a synching procedure..p  pSo Im thinking to implement a remote support application with springremoting with a remote interface in order to get customers. This remote application is connected to ERP database, and all my apps will call remote service to get data.p  pNow my questions is p  ol lipcould it be a good approach or there are better way to implement thispli liphow to reference the Customer entity in my Orders Following this solution I dont have local Customer table anymore.. I think I can do in domain classp  precodeEntity public class Order      ....      private Integer customerId       Transient      private Customer customer      ...   codepre  pand bind transient Customer every time I load Order object by calling remote service.

This is my main class Now what happens is this. Im trying to make it so that a person can choose what level they want to play on Level A or Level B. I then add a JPanel that contains that game level for the user to play If I add the game level in the main method, everything works finep  pWhen I click the button and THEN add the JPanel, however, the player cant move and thats about it all the monsters in the level work perfectly, however.p  pAny thoughts Does ButtonListener override KeyListener or something BTW, setFocusable is set to true in the game level panel class already, so I doubt thats an issuep

Negative 93378 pI have a question regarding rich internet applications with JQuery. Id like to create a simple, dynamic quizapplication that is implemented into a website. I plan on doing that with html5, css3 and javascript JQuery. Therefore Id like to create this app with a specific content size for example 1000x800 pixel, placed in the mainarea of a website, between the standardmenus in the middle. I have set up a little sample project, all the animations i created are visible on the whole screen, but Id like to achieve that these animations are only visible in my specified container in the middle of the website, which has a size of 1000x800 pixels. At the end, the application should look similar to a Flash or Silverlight application, but preferably written in JQuery.p  pDoes anyone have recommendations on what is the best approach to create such a web applikation with a fixed content size that does not affect the rest of the websitep  pId really appreciate any input, thank you p

Negative 93378 pDue to limitations of the experimental Search API Ive decided to use Apache Lucene for my fulltext search needs. I have looked at the AppEngine ports of Lucene but they do not suit my needs ones using RAMIndex will not support the size of my index and ones using the datastore are too slow performancewise, so Ive tested out Lucene using my local filesystem and found that it works perfectly for me.p  pNow my problem is how to get it to work on AppEngine. We are not allowed to write to the filesystem, but that is fine because he index is created on my dev machine and is readonly on the server periodically I will update the index and need to push the new index up. Reading from the filesystem is allowed so I figured that I would be able to bundle up my index along with my other static files and have access to it. p  pThe problem that Ive run up against is the AppEngine static file quotas a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comappenginedocsjavaruntime relnofollowhttpsdevelopers.google.comappenginedocsjavaruntimea at the bottom of the page. My index is only around 750MB so I am fine on the total files lt 1GB front, however some of my index files are several hundred MB and therefore would not be allowed on AppEngine due to the 32 MB max per file.p  pIs there any way to deploy and read static files larger than 32 MB on AppEngine Or will I be stuck having to setup some other server for instance Amazon just to read my Lucene indexp

Negative 93378 pIm working in a image processing project and I have to use a camera and a projector The project is programmed with javacv. I can access to the camera with a external URL and take snapshots. However, I need to calibrate both, cameraprojector so while I was looking for information in the red I found a code called Procamcalib that allow me to calibrate both and it also works. The problem is that the calibration program use the function  FrameGrabber for accessing to the camera and instead of open the external camera, it open the camera of my laptop.  The thing is, when is used FrameGrabber 0, the zero value determine the device number but I have to access to the camera with an external URL, and I cant put in the code the direction when is used OpenFrameGrabber. I would like to know how can I combine both functions or something similar to fix the program and open the correct camera. Thank youp

Negative 93378 pI found a memory leak in my XNA 4.0 application written in C. The program needs to run for a long time days but it runs out of memory over the course of several hours and crashes. Opening Task Manager and watching the memory footprint, every second another 2030 KB of memory is allocated to my program until it runs out. I believe the memory leak occurs when I set the codeBasicEffect.Texturecode property because that is the statement that finally throws the codeOutOfMemorycode exception.p  pThe program has around 300 large 512px textures stored in memory as Texture2D objects. The textures are not square or even powers of 2  e.g. can be 512x431  one side is always 512px. These objects are created only at initialization, so I am fairly confident it is not caused by creatingdestroying Texture2D objects dynamically. Some interface elements create their own textures, but only ever in a constructor, and these interface elements are never removed from the program.p  pI am rendering texture mapped triangles. Before each object is rendered with triangles, I set the codeBasicEffect.Texturecode property to the already created codeTexture2Dcode object and the codeBasicEffect.TextureEnabledcode property to codetruecode. I apply the codeBasicEffectcode in between each of these calls with codeBasicEffect.CurrentTechnique.Passes[0].Applycode   Im aware that Im calling codeApplycode twice as much as I should, but the code is wrapped inside of a helper class that calls codeApplycode whenever any property of codeBasicEffectcode changes.p  pI am using a single codeBasicEffectcode class for the entire application and I change its properties and call codeApplycode any time I render an object.p  pFirst, could it be that changing the codeBasicEffect.Texturecode property and calling codeApplycode so many times is leaking memory Second, is this the proper way to render triangles with different textures E.g. using a single codeBasicEffectcode and updating its propertiesp  pThis code is taken from a helper class so Ive removed all the fluff and only included the pertinent XNA callsp  precodesingle BasicEffect object for entire application BasicEffect effect  new BasicEffectgraphicsDevice   loaded from file at initialization before any Draw is called Texture2D texture1  new Texture2Dimage1.jpg Texture2D texture2  new Texture2Dimage2.jpg   render object 1 ifeffect.Texture  texture1  effect.Texture eventually throws OutOfMemory exception     effect.Texture  texture1 effect.CurrentTechnique.Passes[0].Apply effect.TextureEnabled  true effect.CurrentTechnique.Passes[0].Apply graphicsDevice.DrawUserIndexedPrimitivesPrimitiveType.TriangleList, vertices1, 0, numVertices1, indices1, 0, numTriangles1   render object 2 ifeffect.Texture  texture2     effect.Texture  texture2 effect.CurrentTechnique.Passes[0].Apply effect.TextureEnabled  true effect.CurrentTechnique.Passes[0].Apply graphicsDevice.DrawUserIndexedPrimitivesPrimitiveType.TriangleList, vertices2, 0, numVertices2, indices2, 0, numTriangles2 codepre  pIts an XNA application, so 60 times per second I call my Draw method, which renders all my various interface elements. This means that I could be drawing between 100200 textures per frame, and the more textures I draw, the faster I run out of memory, even though I am not calling codenewcode anywhere in the updatedraw loops. I am more experienced with OpenGL than DirectX, so clearly something is happening behind the scenes that is creating unmanaged memory Im not aware of.p

And when I browse the web, it appears that I am not the only one looking for thisp  pa hrefhttpswww.google.nlsearchqhtasleep relnofollowhttpswww.google.nlsearchqhtasleepap  pI bet that if you read this, you probably needed this as wellp  pThe best solution that I could find appears to be the one which uses the PING command. But especially for a situation were just need to pause the script for a few 100ms, this solution is quiet odd as it uses an external command and triggers all kind of network processes that unlikely have anything to do with the concerned .HTA script.p  pSo the first thing that came to my mind was to use the WMI Win32PingStatus class to avoid the external command but then I started to question why not completely basing it on WMI. It has taken me several hours to get the right WMI classes and methods in place, but finally I succeededp

If codeyieldcode is a special codereturncode, what is codereturncode doing herepli lipWhy do we have to return an codeIEnumeratorcodepli lipDoes codeStartCoroutinecode start a new threadpli lipHow many times has codeWaitAndPrintcode been called in the above example Did codeyield return new WaitForSecondswaitTimecode really returned If yes then I guess codeWaitAndPrintcode was called twice in the above code. And I guess codeStartCoroutinecode was calling codeWaitAndPrintcode multiple times. However, I saw a hrefhttpdocs.unity3d.comDocumentationScriptReferenceMonoBehaviour.StartCoroutine.htmlfromCoroutine relnofollowanother Unity documentationa that says The execution of a coroutine can be paused at any point using the yield statement. The yield return value specifies when the coroutine is resumed. These words make me feel that codeWaitAndPrintcode actually has not returned it was merely paused it was waiting for codeWaitForSecondscode to return. If this is the case, then in the above code codeWaitAndPrintcode was called only once, and codeStartCoroutinecode was just responsible for starting the function, not calling it multiple times.pli ol

Negative 93378 pIm currently looking at options for interfacing with an RS232 modem that only supports halfduplex communication.p  pAt first, I thought setting up a PPP connection would be viable, but it sounds like it anticipates a fullduplex connection even with hardware flow control enabled. The application Im looking into is mostly upload on the field side and Id like to have it configure the channel as such. IE the field side should mostly have a CTS during normal operations.p  pA few options Ive considered...p  pI may just try PPP once I have access to the modems and see how it behaves but looking through the code it appears it does not ever assert RTS.p  pCreate my own HDLC framed protocol handler stack in Netty.p  pCreate a TTY pair with PPP on one side and a halfduplex handling application on the other which communicates with the actual serial port and modem.p  pAny thoughts or best approachesp  pThanks.p

Negative 93378 pI have recently switched over from OpenOffice Base to MySQL community. In ooBase you can customize integers upon entering them into the database. For example I could type 201300000 and then every number in this column would be formatted in this way 201300001, 201300002, .... After playing around with MySQL community for a while I noticed that there is no obvious way to format a custom integer like this. I might be overlooking something basic, but if anyone knows how to do this please let me know. Thank youp

Negative 93378 pCurrently I am working on an XNA project and pimped up the codeMicrosoft.Xna.Framework.Audio.SoundEffectInstancecodeclass a little by creating a wrapper which provides events to signal the different states of the sound i.e. stopped, playing, paused.p  pNow I have the following situation I create an instance of my class EventSoundEffect as a local reference, e.g.p  precodepublic void func ... EventSoundEffect ese  new EventSoundEffect some sound  ... ese.Stopped  Callback     ese.playAsync method ends directly after ese.playAsync   private void Callbackobject sender, EventArgs e  do stuff  codepre  pI realized the eventfiring using the codeThreadPoolcode and a codewhilecodeloop. Not very nice, but it works. When the state of the sound changes, I find that in the codewhilecodeloop likep  precodePseudocode public void playAsync      sound.Play  starts playing sound asynchronously, returns immediately SoundEffectInstance      ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem obj gt          while...            ifsound.SoundState  SoundState.Stop            break                  ifSoundStoppedEvent  null             SoundStoppedEventthis, new EventArgs               codepre  pNow, could it actually happen that the GC will strike in between the end of codefunccode and codeCallbackcode and so actually collect the object on the heapbr The local reference to the object is lost after codeplayAsynccode, but the thread from the codeThreadPoolcode still works on it and eventually a reference will show up at codeCallbackcode sender. Could this lead to unforeseen consequencesbr Thank youp

Negative 93378 pI am working on my course homework for modifying the memory directory of Sysfs in Linux Kernel. I am seeking help from people here after taking permission from my prof. Heres what I exactly want to do.p  pBackground If I have a 4 GB RAM I can have 4 X 1 GB DIMMS or 2X 2GB DIMMS on my motherboard. NUMA is supported in Linux by dividing this 4GB physical memory into many chunks with specific starting and ending physical address for each chunk. The devices directory in Sysfs contains the global device hierarchy. This contains every physical device that has been discovered by the bus types registered with the kernel. Hence the details regarding the memory chunks are stored in the path sysdevicessystemmemory of Linux Kernel. In this directory, we have a file called blocksizebytes which decides how many parts my RAM can be split into. For example in my system it is 8000000 and hence the RAM is split into 32 memory folders from memory0 to memory43. Every memoryX directory will have a file called state which represents the onlineoffline state of the memory chunk. I can toggle between onlineoffline if I want to switch off that particular chunk off memory.p  pSo heres what I exactly want to do  p  pI want to modify this whole directory structure into 4 directories. Why 4 Because, I have 4 X 1GB DIMMS on my motherboard, so I want reduce these 32 memory chunks in to to 4 big chunks so that I can control whichever DIMM I want by toggling its state onlineoffline. So Basically I want to change the state of the memory on DIMM level. p  pThats pretty much my problem description. p  pMy approach I have read through the sysfs file system and tried to look up the kernel modules which are responsible for organizing the memory directory of sysfs. I want to find the module and edit it as per my requirement and compile that module. It got increasingly difficult to find the specific documentation regarding this topic which lead me to ask this question. All I could find was that there this C programming file libmodules3.8.019genericsourcedriversbasememory.c which has methods for setting the state of the memory chunks, showing the starting and ending physical address of each memory section and many other methods. But I am not able to figure out where exactly these methods are being called or which module is utilizing this C file to set all the attributes. p  pCould you please let me know which exact module I need to look for If you find my approach wrong, could you please point me in the right directionp  pThanks in advance   p

Negative 93378 pIm doing an encryption algorithm, DES Data Encryption Standard. A stretch of the problem Example Let K be the hexadecimal key K  133457799BBCDFF1. This gives us as the binary key setting 1  0001, 3  0011, etc., and grouping together every eight bits, of which the last one in each group will be unused K  00010011 00110100 01010111 01111001 10011011 10111100 11011111 11110001. The 64bit key is permuted according to the following table, PC1. Since the first entry in the table is 57, this means that the 57th bit of the original key K becomes the first bit of the permuted key K. The 49th bit of the original key becomes the second bit of the permuted key. The 4th bit of the original key is the last bit of the permuted key. Note only 56 bits of the original key appear in the permuted key.

This is part of implementing a MergeSort by linked list. And my testcase is this recursion and this Merge function is list1  2 and list2  4 , so the Merge function is designed to return the head of a linked list 2,4 which has a size of two nodes.p  pIn my code above, I declared a new node to travelnext in each of my if statement and I move travel one step further. Hence after the while loop, my linked list becomes 2,4,0 and I have a pointer travel pointing to ListNode0. However, it cannot be deleted I have tried both by delete resultnextnext and delete travel but it can still return resultnextnextval, which is 0 my last cout statementp  pWHYp  pI declared this new ListNode which is a struct in my heap memory. And I want to delete this ListNode out of the while loop. But my delete never works. Maybe the travel was in heap in the brackets, but came out as stack memory after the while loop because I declare the dynamic memory in my loopp

Negative 93378 pI am working on a program with a database that translates known strings. p  pFor example if i have the car is blue it looks in the database for this exact string and takes the corresponding translation and pastes it there if the string is stored in the database.p  pSo far all is working fine. p  pProblem is that many times I have a sentence like there are 3 blue cars in the park but my database has the sentence there are 2 blue cars in the park stored.p  pWhat i would need is that the program looks up the database for strings that are identical but with different numbers. Sqlite databasep  pSo far it should not be too difficult. It will return the translated text but with the wrong numbers. Now I would need to replace the numbers in the text to the coorect ones. this also wouldnt be too difficult. But the problem is that one sentence could have more than one number, and in the translated text the order of the numbers is different. p  pFor example the sentence there are 3 cars with 2 seats in the park once translated could become there are 2 seats in 3 cars in the park obviously in the proper Languagep  pthe numbers have switched and i need this to be taken into account when generating the new translation. How can this final part be solvedp  pThanksp  pEDITp  pI had an idea but i am not sure it worksp  pI have my original string there are 3 cars in the park with 2 seatsp  pi search for the string with no numbers and get the one with wrong numbers. p  pfor example there are 4 cars in the park with 5 seatsp  pI compare the two sentences and know that every 3 is replaced by a 4 and every 2 is replaced by a 5p  pi run a string replace on the returned translated text and replace all the numbers...p  pBUT while i am writing i am noticing a problem if i have the sentence there are 3 cars int he park with 2 seats and the returned sentence from the database is there are 5 cars in the park with 5 seats then it wont work as the result would be there are 3 cars in the park with 3 seats.. do you have an idea on how to overcome this last partp

Negative 93378 pI have MVC 4 Webapplication, which contains an API Controller for CRUD operations against a data source. To simplify what im try to do, Ill use a movie repository as example. Data source contains one Class, called MovieDataTitle,Genre,MovieId etc, which methods GetAllMovies, Update, Create,GetMovieByid. Calling the data source is costly, so I want to impement some sort of caching, espesially on the retrieval of the movie list.

Negative 93378 pIm using Python 3.3.5 and the logging module to log information to a local file from different threads. There are cases where Id like to output some additional information, without knowing exactly what that information will be e.g. it might be one single line of text or a dict.p  pWhat Id like to do is add this additional information to my log file, after the log record has been written. Furthermore, the additional info is only necessary when the log level is error or higher. p  pIdeally, it would look something likep  precode20140408 122401  INFO      CPU load not exceeded 20140408 122426  INFO      Service is running 20140408 122434  ERROR     Could not find any active server processes Additional information, might be several lines. Dict structured information would be written as follows key1value1 key2value2 20140408 122516  INFO      Database is responding codepre  pShort of writing a custom log formatter, I couldnt find much which would fit my requirements. Ive read about filters and contexts, but again this doesnt seem like a good match.p  pAlternatively, I could just write to a file using the standard IO, but most of the functionality already exists in the Logging module, and moreover its threadsafe. p  pAny input would be greatly appreciated. If a custom log formatter is indeed necessary, any pointers on where to start would be fantastic.p

Id prefer this to happen without the user having to launch my app and ideally, if the prior notification has not been dismissed, this new notification should replace the old one or perhaps show up in the list of notifications.p  pHow do you do something like this in iOS in the background without requiring the user to open the app to schedule and configure the next notificationp

So it essentially non functional.  p  pI can try to fix the clone, but I am hoping there is a better automated solution before I script something.p  ol liDoes anyone have a better methods for sshfs  I tried vagrantsshfs but that didnt workli liIs there a better way to use r10k to create a working copyli liIs there a better sandbox environmentli ol

Negative 93378 pSo far Ive had some success in calculating dynamic table cell layouts with auto layout. And so far, I have maintained different storyboards for iPhone and iPad. I would now like to consolidate them into a single storyboard per app. Im currently stuck at a point where my height calculations do no longer function.p  pThe trouble is apparently that the table view cell as dequeued from the storyboard is still at its fixed storyboard size relative to a specific device, i.e. iPhone in my case when the calculation is first required. It will be resized to fit the actual device iPad in my case when the table is displayed. But codetableViewheightForRowAtIndexPathcode is called before that and therefore does its calculation based on the wrong table cell width.p  pIs there a good way to solve this problem It seems as if a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions18746929usingautolayoutinuitableviewfordynamiccelllayoutsvariablerowheightsthisa accepted answer also isnt immune because its instructions also only mention the cell in isolation from its table view.p  blockquote   pFirst, instantiate an offscreen instance of a table view cell, one   instance for each reuse identifier, that is used strictly for height   calculations.p blockquote

Negative 93378 pI am just starting to learn android application development. I was looking through the checkbox and probing on various possibilities of dynamically creating it and much more.  Now, I have a small doubt out of curiosity.  QUESTION   Say I have 10 items in a string array with each one having their own names. Now , all I needed to know is.. I can implement checkbox manually for these 10 items. But my question is , Say I have 100 items listed with each one having unique name.I want to create checkbox dynamically on reading the number of items in my string array and also to set the text of each checkbox to the correspondingly read item in my string array. p  pExample say I have 4 names. Apple, Google, Microsoft, Linux.  Now in my activity i wanted to set 4 checkbox dynamically and set the text of each checkbox to these four values. A generalized solution i.e. to expand your code for any number of items for this question will be appreciated .p  pAny help on this is highly appreciated. Thanks to those genius developers out there and I am so happy to be a part of this forum as well. This forum has taught me so many things with those incredible developers out there.p

Negative 93378 pSo I just realized that onStop is getting called in my Activity when the power button is clicked to turn off the screen. Previously only onPause was called. Was this a KitKat change and are there notes about it anywhere was it intentional Is this a KitKat change or something that specific manufacturers implementedp  pstrongEDIT Ill be updating this soon with more infostrong. I think the change was more subtle than I first realized, possibly due to me holding a partial wake lock or listening for GPS updates. Regardless, all I know is that in my code, prior to KitKat, onStop  was not called when the power button was clicked. Perhaps this is also device dependent.p  pstrongEDIT New information. With the following settings, onStop is not called when the power button is clicked Android minSDKVersion4, and targetSDKVersion8, if using Android Studio, set compileSdkVersion8 as well. Verified this on 2 devices running KitKat and JellyBeanstrong So this issue is not KitKat as first mentioned in the original, but rather the min,target sdk settings. strongBounty will be awardedstrong to whomever can find references to when it changed or at least show the first mintarget sdk setting that changed the behavior to call onStop from a power button click.p

Negative 93378 pDocumentation tools like YUIDocs allow you to identify and describe Classes object classes using the codeclasscode tag in comment blocks. Each identified Class requires a codestaticcode or codeconstructorcode tag, defined as followsp  ul licodeconstructorcode  Indicates that the class is instantiable created with the new keyword.li licodestaticcode  Indicates that you should not instantiate the class with new. You can call all of the class methods statically.li ul  pIn Ember, you often create subclasses using codeextendcode. To the best of my knowledge, this does not create a new instance of a class. However, many of these definitions e.g. a routes controller are singleton even though you use codeextendcode to define them.p  pThus, my question is in which common situations of documenting Classes in an ember app would you use codeconstructorcode vs codestaticcode Such examples arep  ul liInitializersli liThe Routerli liAdaptersli liSerializersli liTransformationsli liRoutesli liThe Storeli liModelsli liControllersli liViewsli liComponentsli liMixinsli ul  pI dont include Handlebars helpers here because I believe they are actually methods, not classes, but if Im wrong I will correct this question.p

Negative 93378 pFirstly I shall note, my program needs only work on Linux, built with a modern version of GCC so portability concerns are not terribly relevant here the software is already using highly platform specific features for low level hardware functionality.p  pI have been having a problem by which I have a number of processes, a parent and some children. The parent has the receiving end of a POSIX message queue and the children each have a sending end. The children are in effect receiving messages over a network details irrelevant here and sending them to the parent which then processes the data and stores it. This is working fine for the vast majority of my use case.p  pHowever I have just had to add functionality by which clients over the network need to request small amounts of data as well as just sending it however sending will still be the main case.p  pMy initial plan was to use the codepipecode syscall in the child when it received this neq type of request and have it send a special message to the parent requesting the parent open the pipe and send some data back to the child. However this approach was cut short when I discovered that file descriptors can only be sent over domain sockets and not message queues.p  pI then realized while playing with a bash shell that it is possible to use procpidofchildfdpipefd where pidofchild is the PID of the child process and pipefd is the file descriptor of the write end of the pipe in the child to grab the childs pipe without it having to send it to us.p  pSo, my current plan is to have the child send its PID and the file descriptor of the write end of its pipe down the message queue to the parent, the parent can then open the pipe through the proc filesystem, write the message to the child and then close it again.p  pHowever, looking online I have not been able to find a single case of anyone using this technique for IPC in any program whatsoever so am becoming concerned that there is some huge caveat which I have not considered and is going to make this whole plan fail, what are the concerns I need be aware of when opening another processes pipe through the procxfdy interfacep  pHere is a snippet of my current code note error checking is removed for shortness, also irrelevant lines are removedp  precode Parent Code  static inline void ParentFuncvoid      struct EasySMessage IncomingMQMessage  mallocMQMESSAGESIZE  1      ssizet MQueueMesSize  mqreceiveGlobalsgtEasySMQueue         , IncomingMQMessage, MQMESSAGESIZE  1, NULL     switchIncomingMQMessagegtOpType              case WriteMessage              Process and write the message               SNIP              break         case ReadMessage             char  MyString  FormatProcFDStringIncomingMQMessage             OpenPipeAndReplyIncomingMQMessage, MyString             break         default             printfUnrecognised easys message type dn                 , IncomingMQMessagegtOpType             exit1          freeIncomingMQMessage    Child Code  static int ChildCodemqdt EasySChildMQueue, struct EasySMessage MessageProcessed      sizet SizeToSend  SizeOfMessageMessageProcessed     int Pipes[2]     pipePipes     MessageProcessedgtPipe  Pipes[1]     MessageProcessedgtPid  getpid     mqsendEasySChildMQueue, MessageProcessed, SizeToSend, 0     ReadFromPipeAndReplyPipes     return 0  codepre

Negative 93378 pMy app allows the user to create some objects called Meeting with a date field and a boolean field. I need to create a job to delete these objects exactly 1 hour before that date if the boolean field is False. I thought a Backgroundjob could be the solution but after i read the parse documentation im not so sure. After i created a backgroundjob i can schedule the job to start at a precise time and to repeat itself every, for example, 1 minute. Considering having thousands of objects wouldnt be a better solution to just plan a specific delete task on the date i want Is this possible with a backgroundjob The other solution i found is clientside, by checking the objects from the app itself and calling a deleteInBackground if needed but i would be happy to avoid this because i think a serverside solution would be more efficient.p
Negative 93378 pIm pretty new to .NET and C.p  pI recently took up the task of upgrading my application from .NET 4.0 to .NET 4.5 to keep up with other products in my team. p  pI would like to be able to run my application which has several projects, some web projects based on ASP .NET and some standalone app projects console application on .NET 4 and .NET 4.5. p  pAfter following instructions online regarding a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryw4atty6828vvs.11029.aspx relnofollowcodeltsupportedRuntimegtcode Elementa to upgrade from .NET 4.0 to .NET 4.5 by changing the target runtime I realized that the codecompilationcode elements codetargetFrameworkcode attribute is now code4.5code. I understand that this means the code will definitely work on .NET framework 4.5. p  pWhat if I have a set of nodes that are waiting for 4.5 upgrade which are still running .NET 4.0. Im pretty sure that my changes would break the application. p  pSo I did some research and after referring to some documentation online, Ive removed the codeskucode attribute from the codesupportedRuntimecode element in the code.configcode files of the projects in the solution. Though the codeversioncode attribute of the codesupportedRuntimecode element is still codev4.0code CLR version.

The aim is to upgrade to .NET 4.5. But the standalone script runs on a set of nodes that run on Windows Server 2003 that does not support .NET 4.5. Ive got my system admin team to allocate another node with .NET 4.5 for this process alone. So for the time being I cant really completely upgrade my existing code. Until after I test my existing code on .NET 4.5 and configure deployment to those new nodes. Thanks to that comment from hvd which lit a bulb in my confused brain. Now I know how to proceed.p

Negative 93378 pIve been learning php for a fair while now. Recently I moved to oop programming in php and yet even more recently, Ive been trying to learn MVC structuring whilst doodling around and studying and putting things together... One question that Ive been having problems with recently, is working out just how this whole autoloading, using namespaces and autoloading files from multiple directories work. For example, Ive in the passed been using this technique to autoload from multiple directories...p  precodefunction autoloadclassName  extensions  array.lib.php, .controller.php, .model.php paths  arraylibs, controllers, models foreach paths as path      filename  path . DIRECTORYSEPARATOR . className     foreach extensions as ext          if isreadablefilename . ext              requireonce filename . ext             break                codepre  p splautoloadregisterautoloadp  panyway.. one problem im having though, is how I could instead use namespaces or something because Ive heard that its not new practise to name files as such as for example... index.controller.php or index.model.php or index.view.php or once again index.lib.php but rather use namespaces or something rather which I havent been able to properly grasp how to tie together with autoloading now... For anybody curious. Just for the sake of autoloading and learning this, Ive currently got my directories set up like this. p  pMYMVCbr  controllersbr  libsbr  modelsbr  viewsbr  .htaccessbr  index.phpp  pbr br  Im sorry that Ive really probably worded this pretty poorly and I really hope that somebody at all can really even understand where Im coming from or see what Im getting at even at all...

Thanks guys for even taking the time to read this if youve actually read this far  have a great day toop  pAside from this.

Negative 93378 pRecently I am learning how to use tree to solve the longest common substring problem.

If you have multiple nodes at the same depth, you have to compare the length of the string represented by that node. i.e. ABC, BC, and C all have the same depth, so you have to compare the length of ABC, BC, and C strings to see which is longer which is ABC obviously.p blockquote  pHere I thought the process of finding deepest internal nodes which have leaf nodes from all strings is actually the process of finding longest common prefix of all suffixes from all strings.p  pSo heres a question Why dont we build prefix tree which store all suffixes from all strings Then we can search prefix tree to find longest common prefix of these suffixes. I cannot tell the difference between these two. Could anyone give me some clues why we use suffix tree instead of prefix tree to solve this problemp

Negative 93378 pIm building a custom ASP.NET Identity 2.0 implementation that uses our own data model, another ORM, other business logic, etc. By default, a user is logged in by setting the codeApplicationCookiecode, after which the codeAuthorizeAttributecode recognizes the cookie and logs the user in. For our own implementation, I  want to add more ways to log in. For examplep  ul liImpersonationli liPassword reset tokenli liGoogle Authenticator twofactorli liSMS twofactorli ul  pIn all these scenarios the user must be logged in, strongbutstrong what actions the user is allowed to perform depends on the way he logged in. For example when the user logged in using a password reset token, he may change his password but not do anything else. When the user logged in with username  password, he may do basically everything, except for the actions that need a higher permission level where the twofactor methods come in play. In order to do this, I want to build a custom codeAuthorizeAttributecode that checks what login method was used, and then decides whether the user may perform the action or not.p  pThe problem Im facing is that I can set other cookies than codeApplicationCookiecode e.g. the codeTwoFactorCookiecode that is being set by going through the SMS process, but those cookies are not recognized as authentication cookies. Thus, when I have a codeTwoFactorCookiecode, I cant use that cookie to log in. Only having an codeApplicationCookiecode results in a log in.p  pThe issues Im struggling withp  ul liDo I always need to use codeApplicationCookiecode to log in or can I use custom cookies to log in as well so for example I can log in using codeApplicationCookiecode, codeTwoFactorCookiecode and codeXYZCookiecodeli liShould I have different cookies for each authentication method or should I have only 1 cookie and store the authentication methodtype in a different way for example in a Claimli liIf I should use different cookies, should I also write custom authentication middleware for each authentication methodtype or can I use the default codeCookieAuthenticationMiddlewarecode As far as I know, the only thing that has to be done is set a cookie, and flag it with the correct authentication method so I can see how the user was logged in.li ul  pstrongEditstrongp  pAs per Hao Kungs suggestion I made a couple of extension methods that look like thisp  precodepublic static void UseSmsSignInCookiethis IAppBuilder app, TimeSpan expires      if app  null         throw new ArgumentNullExceptionapp      app.UseCookieAuthenticationnew CookieAuthenticationOptions              AuthenticationType  ApplicationAuthenticationTypes.Sms,         AuthenticationMode  AuthenticationMode.Passive,         CookieName  CookiePrefix  ApplicationAuthenticationTypes.Sms,         ExpireTimeSpan  expires,       codepre  pI try to log someone in by calling codeAuthenticationManager.SignIncode with a custom codeClaimsIdentitycode that has my custom AuthenticationType SMS.

Negative 93378 pSo I am quite the beginner in the world of web development. I have been working on a django application, and now that my application is running pretty well I am staring into the face of the monster that is deployment, and wondering which direction to take. p  pMy application is running Django 1.7 and Python 3.4. I want to use PostgreSQL with Postgis as my database. I was originally thinking of using Amazon AWS for deployment, using their Elastic Beanstalk PaaS service, although now I am wondering if something like Heroku may be better for me as a beginner to all of this. I need my application to scale easily, without me having to dive into too much configuration that I am very likely to mess up. p  pWhat I am wondering is which service would be best for a newcomer developer deploying an application running the platforms I mentioned above. Heroku seems like it is a bit easier to use than AWS, but I am concerned that the pricing with Heroku would ramp up more quickly than with AWS. How difficult would it be to initially deploy using one service and migrate to another as I become more familiar with the process of maintaining web applications andor as my needs changep  pAny recommendations or info to help me decide on a service to go with would be very much appreciated.p

Negative 93378 pThis is a good theory discussion. I have a VBA heavy workbook that pulls information from a database for a specific item. Lets pretend that that item is a sales invoice.

The goal is to provide a hyperlink I build that when a user clicks it, the cell value is set then the data refreshed. I am not sure where to look for this answer.p  pThank you.p

Negative 93378 pI want to match a string which may contain a type of character before the match, or the match may begin at the beginning of the string same for end of string.p  pFor a minimal example, consider the text coden.b.code, which Id like to match either at the beginning of a line and end of a line or between two nonword characters, or some combination. The easiest way to do this would be to use word boundaries codebn.b.bcode, but that doesnt match similar cases happen for other desired matches with nonword characters in them.p  pIm currently using code[w]n.b.[w]code, which works satisfactorily, but will also match the nonword characters such as dashes which appear immediately before and after the word, if available. Im doing this in grep, so while I could easily pipe the output into sed, Im using greps codecolorcode option, which is disabled when piping into another command for obvious reasons.p  pEDIT The codeKcode option i.e. codeK[w]n.b.K[w]code seems to work, but it also does discard the color on the match within the output. While I could, again, invoke auxiliary tools, Id love it if there was a quick and simple solution.p  pEDIT I have misunderstood the codeKcode operator it simply removes all the text from the match preceding its use. No wonder it was failing to color the output.p

Negative 93378 pI am familiar with codestdsharedptrcode and codestdweakptrcode and know how they work. However, I would like the codestdsharedptrcode to emit a callback, like a boost signal. This would allow codestdweakptrcode, who still refer to the deleted object, to be cleaned up right in time.p  pIs there maybe already some smart pointer implementation, which will report the destructionp  h2Explanationh2  pI think there might be a small design flaw in codestdweakptrcodes, that can lead to false memory leaks. By false memory leak I mean an object, that is still accessible by the program, but whose reason of existence is not valid anymore. The difference to a true memory leak is, that the true memory leak is completely unknown by the program, while the false leak is just a part that wasnt cleaned up properly.p  pAnother description can be found at a hrefhttpwww.codingwisdom.comcodingwisdom201209referencecountedsmartpointersareforretards.html relnofollowcodingwisdom.comap  blockquote   pUse Watchersp      ol   lipOne of the problems with freeing an object is that you may have done so while other things are still pointing at it.  This introduces dangling pointers and crashes  To combat the evil of dangling pointers, I like to use a basic watcher system.  This is not unlike the weak reference discussed above.  The implementation is like thispli   lipCreate a base class Watchable that you derive from on objects that should broadcast when theyre being deleted.  The Watchable object keeps track of other objects pointing at it.   Create a Watcher smart pointer that, when assigned to, adds itself to the list of objects to be informed when its target goes away.pli   ol      pThis basic technique will go a long way toward solving dangling pointer issues without sacrificing explicit control over when an object is to be destroyed.p blockquote  h2Exampleh2  pLets say we implement the observer pattern using boost a hrefhttpwww.boost.orgdoclibs1580dochtmlsignals2.html relnofollowBoost Signals2a. We have a class codeObservablecode, that contains one or more signals and another class codeObservercode, that connects to codeObservablecodes  signals.p  pWhat would happen to codeObservablecodes slots, when a observing codeObservercode is deleted When we do nothing, then the connection would point to nowhere and we would probably receive a segmentation fault, when emitting the signal.p  pTo deal with this issue, boosts slots also offer a method codetrackconst weakptrltvoidgtamp trackedobjectcode. That means, if I call codetrackcode and pass a codeweakptrcode to codeObservercode, then the slot wont be called when the codeweakptrcode expired. Instead, it will be deleted from the signal.p  pWhere is the problem Lets we delete an codeObservercode and never call a certain signal of codeObservablecode ever again. In this case, the tracked connection will also never be deleted. Next time we emit the signal it will be cleaned up. But we dont emit it. So the connection just stays there and wastes resources.p  pA solution would be when owning codesharedptrcode should emit a signal when it is destroying its object. This would allow other other objects to clean up right in time. Everything that has a codeweakptrcode to the deleted object might register a callback and false memory leaks could be avoided.p
Negative 93378 pIm using ActiveAdmin as a CMS.

So I assume there should be a way to rebuild just that one route instead of meddling with resetting resources and readding menu items.p

Negative 93378 pThe unwind segue to the menu view is no longer working on XCode 7 with iOS 9.p  pThe only way I got it to work is by changing the type of segue in the storyboard to an codeECSlidingSeguecode from the default codeUIStoryboardSeguecode. the ability to change this in the storyboard for unwind segues seems to be new to XCode 7. When changed to the codeECSlidingSeguecode it only shows the menu view itself and the view it was supposed to shift to the right but still keep on the screen disappears. All other segues seem to be working and I can confirm that all was working correctly in iOS 8 and XCode 6.p  pAny ideas why this would not be workingp

Negative 93378 pMy SSRS report has the requirement to filter the report based on a cashiers variance to balancing to 0.  My variance is a calculation based on two different datasets and values within those data sets.  p  pIve used some custom code in order to pull some of the data from a second data set and then I use ReportItems expressions to calculate the variance with it all combined in one chart.  The requirement is to only show those cashiers that are off balancing by more than 10.  Ive tried to put the ReportItem expression in the filter for the tablix, but the filters wont take a ReportItem expression.  My next thought was to just hide the rows that dont meet my criteria, but when I do this one of my toggled rows unhides itself because its parent is hidden now based on my row visibility expression.  Is it possible to hide all child rows of hidden rows Ideally, Id turn this into a parameter so that the end user can change the range of what data to look at.p

User1 and User2. Both of them could open a form but the first user User1 must open it read only while the second user User2 could make changes in the data. Is it better here to have the same form for both of them and when it loads check if user1 or user2 has open it and disable the or enable the fieds accordingly or have two different forms for the same thing but form1 has fields disabled by default and form 2 controls are enabled by default.p  pThe above situation is really simple and I think that the answer is a single form. But what if the situation is more complicated Some fields must be enabled to one, others to the other one, different sql queries for both of them, different datatypes between users, etcp

Negative 93378 pHi i need help to configure haproxy for conditional tcp routing and http , https and tcp will be functinal there but https and tcp will work on same portp  pCurrently the connector is pointing to 192.168.104.109. When the connector windows service OpsPRD is started on fdev2 server it will first make a http URL call to the server 192.168.104.109 with the URL ispringFileReaderServletfileNamelibpropertiesispringproperties.xmlampprj274006AB183748D1A59748A29B86A52Dp  pHere prj274006AB183748D1A59748A29B86A52D is the parameter which will help us decide where we want to route the tcp traffic. Lets say, if the parameter prj is equal to 274006AB183748D1A59748A29B86A52D then it should get routed to prdappc2n2. For anything else it should go to prdappc2n1.p
