Positive 114 pSo Im hooking into an application api that returns a flat array of values  the order of the values defines the specific structure of data, and Id like to be able to transform this array into an object that reflects this underlying structure.p  pWorking backward, this is what Id like to end up withp  precodeappnameappX,  affectednodes  [                        nodenamenodeX,nodeidxxx,                        nodenamenodeY,nodeidyyy                     ]  codepre  pBut this is what Im givenp  precode[appX,2,nodeX,xxx,nodeY,yyy] codepre  pThe actual data is much more complex, with multiple tiers of attribute arrays nested within each other. As you can see, Im given the length of each nested attribute in the original flat array, represented in my example as code2code. Ive started wrangling with transforming the flat array into a proper object structure and the whole business seems very inefficient and difficult to maintain. My approach currently looks something like thisp  precodevar arr  [appX,2,nodeX,xxx,nodeY,yyy] var obj    obj.appname  arr[0]  var numnodes  arr[1]  obj.affectednodes  []  var position  1  forvar i  0 i lt numnodes i     var subobj       subobj.nodename  arr[position  1]     subobj.nodeid  arr[position  2]     obj.affectednodes.pushsubobj     position  position  2  codepre  pThis is working, but I feel like there may be a more efficient solution out there that hasnt occurred to me. Is there a better algorithm or perhaps library function to accomplish this sort of taskp

Positive 114 pI have been attempting to wrap my head around an idea that I am certain is possible, I just am not sure if I am going about it in the right way. My intention is to create an array and then fill it with as many values as the user wants. However my goal is to not use any defined value per se. I would like to be able to continue increasing it the amount of values it can contain indefinitely.p  pThis is the test code I have been using to try and figure this outp  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt  int mainvoid          int i         int Up         int Ary[0]          printfPlease enter the number of integers you want to input          scanfd, ampUp         fori  0 i lt Up i                          printfPlease enter a number                  Ary[i]  int mallocsizeofint                 scanfd, ampAry[i]                  fori  0 i lt Up i                          printfd , Ary[i]                 ifi  10  0                                          printfn                                   return 0  codepre  pThis may be a poor way of attempting to figure this out and I may also be doing this is a completely wrong way However I get a segmentation fault sometimes. If I use small values such as only entering 4 or 5 values it works fine, however if I enter 10 values it gives me a segmentation fault. If I enter 50 values, it lets me enter all 50 but gives me a segmentation fault after printing out the 41st value. p  pThe code itself is simply a means to an end. Ultimately what I would like to know is how I can set up an array of anything that can have values added to it indefinitely while retaining previous values using dynamic memory allocation p  pemPS. I hope this defines my question well enough, however if it does not I would like to refine my question so it is more clear. Please make a comment if this is unclear and why.emp

I also tried doing simple tests which also failed.  p  precode returns an empty array object. this object should have the following    methods  pushval adds val to the end of the array  pop removes a value from the end and returns it  the goal of this problem is to reverse engineer what array methods are actually doing and return an object that has those methods function createArray      CODE HERE     var array  []     array.push  functionval          array[array.length]  val         return array             array.pop  function         return array[array.length1]        createArray console.logarray.pushhey codepre  pAnd the error messagep  precodeconsole.logarray.pushhey              ReferenceError array is not defined     at Object.ltanonymousgt UsersFoxDocumentsProgrammingCodesmithprecoursepart1Level2Intermediatesrcmain.js6713     at Module.compile module.js46026     at Object.Module.extensions..js module.js47810     at Module.load module.js35532     at Function.Module.load module.js31012     at Function.Module.runMain module.js50110     at startup node.js12916     at node.js8143 codepre  pI realize array is a local variable.

Negative 114 pI have a pretty monstrous Java app in development here. As of now, its only ever been deployed on my locally installed TomcatMySQL setup.p  pFor completeness, the app is an online game server written using Spring, Hibernate with MySQL currently on the backend.p  pNow, I can easily package up the WAR and get that on the remote server.. The problem is the database. Right now its generated with an ANT script that uses Hibernate specifically, the HBM2DDL Ant task to generate the schema, and then populates the db with a combination of static SQL and a couple of antbased parsers that read from other data XML mostly. After that, I have a fully created DB populated with the game servers starting data set.p  pThe issue is being a bit green in Java I have no idea what the right way to deploy this is. p  pShould Ip  ol liExport the SQL from my local MySQL and manually import it on the new server Eww.li liMake the ANT script less grody its got lots of hardcoded directories in it right now and run it on the serverli liThe elegant option I dont know aboutli ol  pThe other complication is that the WAR will be going to different servers than the MySQL db will be on. Is there a Java book or web resource that comprehensively addresses these kinds of deployment issuesp

Negative 114 pSuppose you have a system on the other side of a network that sends events and data that needs to be cached to some intermediate broker.p  pInstead of giving every component of your application that needs to be informed of such events a new subscription to the broker, I decide for performance and simplicity the third party library that handles broker subscriptions isnt pretty I should have only one Event Processor that subscribes to the broker and programatically fires events as it receives them to subscribed listeners provided by the components.  The cached data can also be shared from this singleton.  This will greatly reduce network connections.p  pHowever according to most discussions about singletons, they are always evil PERIOD unless for concurrency reasons or hardware reasons you need only one access point.  This is not my situation since every component could have their own subscription and their own personal cache of data since all the data can be requested over the broker.  However this could easily add 200 more network connections.p  pBecause singletons are evil does that mean 200 more connections to a broker with 200 copies of data is better than using singleton I dont need to use  After all this slows things down quite a bit but its not game breaking, the application is still usable.p

Negative 114 pIm trying to find the best pragmatic approach to import functions on the fly... let me explain.p  pSay I have a directory called strongemfunctionsemstrong which has these filesp  precodearrayselect.func.php statmediam.func.php statmean.func.php ..... codepre  pI would like to load each individual file which has a function defined inside and use it just like an internal php function.. such as arraypop, arrayshift, etc.p  pOnce I stumbled on a tutorial which I cant find again now that compiled user defined functions as part of a PHP installation.. Although thats not a very good solution because on sharedreseller hosting you cant recompile the PHP installation.p  pI dont want to have conflicts with future versions of PHP  other extensions, i.e. if a function named X by me, is suddenly part of the internal php functions even though it might not have the same functionality per se I dont want PHP to throw a fatal error because of this and fail miserably.p  pSo the best method that I can think of is to check if a function is defined, using functionexists, if so throw a notice so that its easy to track in the log files, otherwise define the function. However that will probably translate to having a lot of includerequire statement in other files where I need such a function, which I dont really like. Or possibly, read the directory and loop over each .func.php file and includeonce. Though I find this a bit ugly.p  pThe question is, have you ever stumbled upon some source code which handled such a case How was it implemented Did you ever do something similar I need as much ideas as possible p

Negative 114 pIm working on a WPF application which must handle multiple screens two at this this time.p  pOne view can be opened on several screens and user actions must be reflected consistently on all screens.p  pTo achieve this, for a given type of view, a single DataContext is instantiated. Then, when a view is displayed on a screen, the unique DataContext is attached to it. So, one DataContext, several views same type of viewxaml.p  pSo far so good. It works quite well in most cases.p  pI do have a problem with a specific view which relies on ItemsControl. These ItemsControl are used to display UIElements dynamically build in the ViewModelDataContext C code. These UIElements are mostly Path objects.

Negative 114 pOur team is in a spike sprint to choose between ActiveMQ or RabbitMQ. We made 2 little producerconsumer spikes sending an object message with an array of 16 strings, a timestamp, and 2 integers. The spikes are ok on our devs machines messages are well consumed.p  pThen came the benchs. We first noticed that somtimes, on our machines, when we were sending a lot of messages the consumer was sometimes hanging. It was there, but the messsages were accumulating in the queue.p  pWhen we went on the bench plateform p  ul licluster of 2 rabbitmq machines 4 cores3.2Ghz, 4Gb RAM, load balanced by a VIPli lione to 6 consumers running on the rabbitmq machines, saving the messages in a mysql DB same type of machine for the DBli li12 producers running on 12 AS machines tomcat, attacked with jmeter running on another machine. The load is about 600 to 700 http request per second, on the servlets that produces the same load of RabbitMQ messages.li ul  pWe noticed that ibsometimesbi, consumers hang well, they are not blocked, but they dont consume messages anymore. We can see that because each consumer save around 100 msgsec in database, so when one is stopping consumming, the overall messages saved per seconds in DB fall down with the same ratio if let say 3 consumers stop, we fall around 600 msgsec to 300 msgsec.p  pDuring that time, the producers are ok, and still produce at the jmeter rate around 600 msgsec. The messages are in the queues and taken by the consumers still alive. p  pWe load all the servlets with the producers first, then launch all the consumers one by one, checking if the connexions are ok, then run jmeter.p  pWe are sending messages to one direct exchange. All consumers are listening to one persistent queue bounded to the exchange. p  pThat point is major for our choice.

Negative 114 pOk... this is sort of a twoparter here.  Sort of.  May actually just be one.  Thats what Im hoping anyway.p  pFirst, more generally, is it possible to target, via XAML only, a named item in a controls emtemplateem  For instance, if a controls template has a ContentPresenter named PARTFoo and we want to specifically set the HorizontalAlignment on that specific item to Stretch via pure styling, can it be done  I know we can do this in the OnApplyTemplate override of a subclass where we explicitly search for the control by name then set the property in code, but again, were hoping for a XAMLonly solution so we can do this strictly via styling and not subclasses, which are mostly discouraged anyway except for specific usecase scenarios.p  pAlso, we do emnotem want to have to manually specify the template for the control as we want the current theme to determine what that template is and thus how the control appears.  We just want to say In whatever template the theme has chosen, if theres a part named foo, set this property on it via pure styling.  If a part with that name isnt found, do nothingp  pThe desire for a XAMLonly approach is more because of the second part, which is were targeting a generated container object, not the control itself, meaning it wouldnt be a straight subclass anyway as wed have to muck around with ItemcontainerGenerators and such, which is a real pain in the a, especially when the ItemsControl is virtualized.p  pFor specifics, our ultimate goal is to single out the Border named Bd in a TreeViews TreeViewItems template and set its attached property Grid.ColumnSpan to 2 instead of its default of 1.  Thats it  It amazes me how something so simple seems damn near impossible without manually replacing the entire TreeViewItems template or resorting to a codebehindbased solution.p

Negative 114 pHey all, have managed to finish the database but have run into a problem with something I did in the beginning. Basically, the calculations in the database are done using VBA code. Now Ive run into a problem where instead of slecting just the last two years worth of data, it is now slecting and using data from more than two years ago. The data it should pick is from the HistoricalStockData table and the HistoricalCurrency table.p  pNow the reason I need to set the two year limit is for the index that we use at work which does some calculations based on just two years worth of data. I wont put all the code here because it might be too much, but if you want I can, Ill put the SQL part of the code here which SELECTs the tables to put into the Recordset.p  precode    Set rst  db.OpenRecordsetSELECT Location.ID, Location.Location, CompanyLocation.StockCode, CompanyInformation.CompanyName, CompanyInformation.NOSH,  amp   CompanyInformation.[CEP NAV], CompanyInformation.CompanyDescription, CompanyInformation.CurrencyCode, HistoricalStockData.StockCode, HistoricalStockData.Dates,  amp   HistoricalStockData.SharePrice, HistoricalStockData.Volume, HistoricalCurrency.Rates  amp   FROM Location RIGHT JOIN HistoricalCurrency RIGHT JOIN CompanyInformation ON HistoricalCurrency.CurrencyCode  CompanyInformation.CurrencyCode  amp   RIGHT JOIN CompanyLocation ON CompanyInformation.StockCode  CompanyLocation.StockCode LEFT JOIN HistoricalStockData ON  amp   CompanyInformation.StockCode  HistoricalStockData.StockCode ON Location.ID  CompanyLocation.LocationID  amp   where CompanyLocation.StockCode amp strStockcode amp  AND HistoricalStockData.Dates[HistoricalCurrency].[Dates] AND HistoricalStockData.Dates gt amp Date amp   730  amp   ORDER BY HistoricalStockData.SharePrice codepre  pNow the thing is I tried using the DateAdd function as well but again no luck I tried placing the SELCT query in Access and it still picks more than two years worth of data so Im not really sure what to do. The reason this is important is because as they start using it daily the index has to change and the 24 month High and Low values will have to change as well, so it needs to work. Funny thing is, it was actually working before, but I cant seem to figure out what I added to the database or what happened that made it not work. p  pI can paste the full VBA code here if itll help out more.p

Negative 114 pI noticed that when I store a double value such as e.g. codex  0.56657011973046234code in an sqlite database, and then retrieve it later, I get codey  0.56657011973046201code. According to the a hrefhttpwww.sqlite.orgdatatype3.html relnofollowsqlite speca and the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.double28VS.8029.aspx relnofollow.NET speca neither of which I originally bothered to read  this is expected and normal.p  pMy problem is that while high precision is not important, my app deals with users inputtingselecting doubles that represent basic 3D info, and then running simulations on them to find a result. And this input can be saved to an sqlite database to be reloaded and rerun later.p  pThe confusion occurs because a freshly created series of inputs will obviously simulate in slightly different way to those same inputs once stored and reloaded as the double values have changed. This is logical, but not desireable.p  pI havent quite come to terms of how to deal with this, but in the meantime Id like to limitclamp the user inputs to values which can be exactly stored in an sqlite database. So if a user inputs code0.56657011973046234code, it is actually transformed into code0.56657011973046201code. p  pHowever I havent been able to figure out, given a number, what value would be stored in the database, short of actually storing and retrieving it from the database, which seems clunky.

Negative 114 pLet me start with my question and then explain what Im trying to do in case people dont understand the question.p  pI want to use the Notification Center to catch an event from a UITabBarController.  Im trying to determine when the tab has been changed.  In the documentation I can see that I can get that event if I use a delegate.  However, I have two separate view controllers in my TabBarController and both need to know if they are active.  Is there some way to find out if that corresponding event sends out a notification  Should I create my own delegate, and send out the notification myselfp  pThis all started when i decided that my program needed to have a different view depending on the orientation.  Ive written my program to have a tab bar at the top level with two tabs.  One is the program, the other is an about window.  When I rotate the device I need the view to change in the first tab and the second tab.  I managed to get this to work by listening for device notifications that alert you when the device has rotated.  I then change the view in the controller based on the orientation.  The problem Im seeing is that both controllers are getting these notifications and I have not found a way for the unselected tab to no longer receive such notifications.  My idea was to listen for which tab was selected and then remove the other one from the rotate notifications.  Thats not working yet.p  pSo, I have no idea if this makes any sense, but curious to see what people say and suggest.p  pRecap How do I find out what notifications are available Should I create a delegate and fire off my own notifications Is there a better way of swapping your view on rotatep

Negative 114 pHey, is there any way to store negative flags in C For example I have the following flags enum that represents some stylesp  precode[Flags] public enum Styles      Default  0,     Bold  1,     Italic  2  codepre  pNow I have multiple objects, those styles can be applied to, and later all related are combined i.e. other object may inherit some previously set styles. In addition to that, I would like to define negative flags, that basically undo inherited styles. So if the style was previously set to codeStyles.Bold  Styles.Italiccode and the object inherits that style but has a negative codeStyles.Boldcode flag set, then the result should be just codeStyles.Italiccode.p  pIs there any mechanism that already does this I basically though of two ways now First is defining codeNotXYcode enum values, that are then somehow parsed to eliminate the codeXYcode values if set.p  pThe other is simply defining two fields, positive and negative flags, where the negative flags are specially defined in an extra field and I get the resulting flags by simply doing codepositiveFlags  negativeFlagscode.p  h3edith3  pIf this wasnt clear, I need to store each of those intermediate objects styles. So it could be for example like thisp  precodeobject1 Default object2 Bold object3 Bold Italic codepre  pAnd if object3 also inherits the values of 1 and 2, then the final result should be just codeItaliccode.p  pAnother example in response to Kieren Johnstones question, and per my statement in the comment that negative values only apply on the current levelp  precode1 Bold 2 Bold Italic 3 Italic codepre  p2 eliminates both Bold and Italic from previous objects, but then shouldnt apply any further positive values should though, so the final value would be codeItaliccode again.p

Negative 114 pI wrote a basic program that takes strings and counts the incidences of unique ones by inserting them into a stringinteger hash map.p  pI use stdtr1unorderedmap for the storage, templated for a custom hash function and a custom equality function.

The program got 33 faster.p  pGiven that when I was using tr1unorderedmap I presized the hash table so it never had to grow, and that I was using exactly the same hash and comparison routines, what is tr1unorderedmap doing that slows it down by 50 as compared to the most basic hash map imaginablep  pCode for the hash map type Im talking about as simple herep  precodetypedef struct dataitem      char item     sizet count  dataitemt  dataitemt hashtable[HASHTABLESIZE]  NULL,0  Start off with empty table  void insertchar item      sizet hash  generatehashitem     sizet firsthash  hash     while true          hash amp HASHTABLESIZEMASK  Bitmasking effect is hash  HASHTABLESIZE         if hashtable[hash].item  NULL   Free bucket             hashtable[hash].item  item             hashtable[hash].count  1             break                  if strcmphashtable[hash].item, item  0   Not hash collision same item             hashtable[hash].count  1             break                  hash  Hash collision.

Negative 114 pIve seen this functionality in many apps in the market, such as ADWLauncher. You install an app but then you can then download apps that only serve to theme the first app. Id really like to do this in an app Ive made but I have no clue how to do it.p  pThe simplest solution would be to simply include all possible themes into the main application and then unlock them based upon what other apps are also installed. This is a nonpreferred solution because the addition of more themes will make the app bigger resulting in wasted space.  This also prevents 3rd parties from coming up with their own themes.p  pAnother solution would be for the resources and classes from the themed app to be loaded in by the vanilla app, but I have no clue how this could be accomplished.p  pIs there another way that this could be accomplished  What is the suggested mechanism to do this  Any input will be greatly appreciated.p  pSimilar questions have been asked before but with no responsep  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3772440androidhowtoallowthirdpartydeveloperstoskinmyappAndroid How to allow thirdparty developers to skin my appap  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3771923androidpossibleforoneapptoprovidestylesthemesforanotherappAndroid Possible for one App to provide StylesThemes for another Appap

Negative 114 pI have an AspxGridView and it has a Button inside of a columns DataItemTemplate. When the value of this column is 0, the image of button is X, when its 1, the image is a tick. Like yesno.p  pSo my system is working this way I click on the button, there comes an edit form, when I edit it, I change the value from 0 to 1, then the image becomes tick. Like editedunedited.p  pIve placed the edit form inside of an AspxPopupControl, it works normal but slow. Because the grid has too many rows and the button causes postback before the popup appears. Thats because Im setting the PopupControl.ShowOnPageLoad to true.p  pI tried also javascript window.open function to avoid from this postback. But since its a button, it makes postback anyway. If I disable postback from Button properties it has no action.p  pI used an imagebutton, or imagelink, but I also have to get the ID with Eval, couldnt figure how to do that.p  pSo, I need to open an edit form, doesnt matter with popup control or new popup page, and I need to do this without postback. I can use a different control inside of DataItemTemplate, just need to get the key value of the row.p  pAny suggestionsp

Ive been given a task by my project architect to create a helper method that sorts a drop down list in an MVC View. I have a View that retrieves various data from a Controller and Im returning some values that I want to appear in a drop down list. Ive been told not to sort it in the Controller and also to pass the field that we want to sort by into the helper method.

Negative 114 pI am making another MineCraft clone, and Ive run into an interesting problem. I have a public enum that lists all the cube types a particular cube can be, and I have a 3d array that holds cubes. Each cube has a specific type, and I iterate through this array to get the vertices for each cube, then pass those vertices to a vertex buffer designated for a particular cube type. When I create a random array of cubes, or a single cube, and tell it what texture it should be everything draws as expected. Im now trying to figure out how to draw a random surface of grass cubes, and fill everything below those on the yaxis with dirt cubes. The strangest thing is happening though, the top most cube is dirt and it fills all the bottom ones with grass cubes When I disable the loop to fill the underground with dirt, the top most cube is displaying grass as intended.p  pHere is what I believe to be the relevant parts of the code.

Negative 114 pIm working with dependency injection at the moment. Effectively this involves the UI layer e.g. a web application including a DI container which has a whole bunch of data about interfaces it will work with, and which implementation to use for each.p  pHowever, because of the need to satisfy dependencies, the DI container also needs to know about interfaces and classes it would not otherwise need access to. For examplep  pThe UI layer needs to work with an codeIWidgetManagercode interface. The configured implentation is codeConcreteWidgetManagercode. This is registered in the DI container.p  pThe codeConcreteWidgetManagercode has a dependency on codeIWidgetRepositorycode. The desired implementation for this is codeConcreteWidgetRepositorycode. Thus the DI container must also know about codeIWidgetRepositorycode and codeConcreteWidgetRepositorycode.p  pHad I simply hardcoded codeConcreteWidgetManagercodes dependency on codeConcreteWidgetRepositorycode, then codeConcreteWidgetRepositorycode could be made internal and therefore invisible to my UI layer. No UI code could bypass the manager layer and work directly with the repository layer.p  pTherefore it seems that the use of DI, although an awesome pattern in many respects, defeats encapsulation from the point of view of the UI layer.p  pAm I right in thinking this, and is there any way to mitigate the situationp

Negative 114 p1 Once Ive bookmarked a particular point in a work flow is there a way for a client to ask the work flow where it is at and retrieve its viable options So like lets say I have 5 buttons labeled 1 through 5... If I Im in step 3 I have the option of going to step 4 or step 5... I want the ability for the client to ask the work flow where Im allowed to go next... The work flow would say these are your options and based on that the client would show buttons 4 and 5 and everything else would be greyed out... I guess in work flow terminology if the work flow is say at a pick waiting for a trigger is there some way the client can be informed of the available pick options....  p  p2 is there any native support for roles that I could also integrate with this So user account manager can click 4 or 5 but call center can only click 5.p  pBasically I have a work flow that needs to model a process obviously and this process is managed at each stage by different departments in the company. But at certain points in the work flow an account manager could be allowed to transition the work flow in 2 or 3 directions where as a call center rep is only allowed to transition it in one direction.... But I need a way for our call center client to ask the work flow what stage something is in and what the user logged in is allowed to do and then based on that the client software will present them with what options they have....p

Negative 114 pIve been using Git for a while, and Id like to convert my usual workflow to Mercurial. In particular, Im interested in converting the workflow I would use to contribute to a Git project in order to be able to contribute to a Mercurial project.p  pTypically, for a project on GitHub, I would fork the project on GibHub from the original project, and then fetch both locally, with two different remote namesp  precode Clone the initial repository and call the remote repository githuborigin git clone o githuborigin gitgithub.comorigauthorproject.git   Add the forked GitHub repo as an additional remote repo githubmine cd project git remote add githubmine gitgithub.commeproject.git git fetch githubmine codepre  pWhen I list the branches with codegit branch acode, I get something like thisp  precode master   remotesgithubminesomefeature   remotesgithubminemaster   remotesgithuboriginHEAD gt githuboriginmaster   remotesgithuboriginsomefeature   remotesgithuboriginmaster codepre  pI can create my own local branches using codegit checkout b newfeaturecode and then push it back to my GitHub repository, thus adding two referencesp  precode myfeature   remotesgithubminemyfeature codepre  pI can then contact the original author to discuss this feature, submit a pull request and so on. All this workflow is actually quite independent from the original authors working time line. This makes it quite easy to discuss experimental features without poluting the main projects repository.p  pIf the original author has commited more changes, I can keep up with codegit fetch githuborigcode and possibly merge or rebase my local changes accordingly. As a quick test assuming by current branch is codemyfeaturecodep  precodegit fetch githuborigin git checkout b temp git rebase githuboriginmaster codepre  pAn essential point of this workflow is to be able to know where each repositorys branch is located compared to my own branches. In particular, its important to know that my branches are not the same as the remote branches with the same name even between the two GitHub repositories, the two codemastercode branches dont need to be the same, for example. Seeing all this is something quite easy using codegitk allcode.p  pIm not sure how to do the same on a Mercurial project e.g. on BitBucket.p  pHere is what Ive tried to do, based on this a hrefhttpmercurial.selenic.comwikiGitConceptsCommandequivalencetable relnofollowCommand Equivalence Tableap  precodehg clone httpsbitbucket.orgorigauthorproject   Edit .hghgrc and add bbminehttpsbitbucket.org...project to [paths]   Apparently equivalent to git fetch. hg pull bbmine codepre  pThis seems to work, and it pulls the remote commits in fact, Ive tried this on a repository where Ive already pushed one of my branches. I can see all the branches using codehg branchescode, but no indication as to where they came from. codehg viewcode doesnt really show anything. More importantly, my codetipcode is now the latest of my commits, but I dont have an equivalent of the codegithuboriginmastercode label that I would have whether its before my own commits or its after if another author has made more changes.p  pI would like to be able to do an codehg pullcode equivalent of codegit fetchcode at any point in time in the future to see what the differences between my local copy and the new changes made by the other authors are without necessarily changing anything in my local repository or in my BitBucket repository at least until Ive fixed potential conflicts due to those changes.p  pOn top of this, I also tend to have my own codebackupcode repository when I use Git which is an SSH server where I can push all branches, even work in progress that is not meant to be published yet.p  pI realise that the Mercurial way of branching isnt quite the same as the Git way. However, is there an equivalent workflow for Mercurial, or will I just have to change my approach How can I see where each of the repositories Im using are up to with their respective branches some of which they may have in commonp
Negative 114 pThis is most likely a very dumb question, so my apologies in advance.  p  pI have a potential client that has had others make the claim that the values we receive from certain Android devices magnetic sensor can be put through a formula using Time to actually calculate nearby voltage.  The idea is to test fairly small voltage amounts around 57v using the device when held near it.p  pI have looked through documentation after documentation, and we have played around with existing calculations that some people have offered, but nothing seems to solidly work.  It does seem interesting that the XYZ values do indeed change dramatically when held close to the voltageproducer they seem to go into the negative for the most part, but there doesnt seem to be a solid way to convert the values to voltage, when I take into account what those xyz values are when held away from the source of voltage they stay around the same, but only positive. p  pI understand that the actual magnetic field can be found via the formula SQRTx2y2z2, but I have not found a solid algorithm for converting that to voltage.p  pSorry again for the dumb question, but is something like this even possible  I figured this was the right place to ask.  Thanks so much in advancep

Negative 114 pI have been trying to write code to generate the XML output from a Junit Result object using the standard schema for Junit reports.p  pI am triggering my tests using Junit 4, hence I am using a JunitCore instance to execute my tests. So, it will not make sense in my case to duplicate the execution by using a JunitTask instance.p  pI am overriding the testRunfinishedResult method available in Junit4. I want to write the transformation logic here so that it generates the XML which can then be viewed using the standard XSLT.p  pOne way would be to write a transformer which creates a document object and then programmatically add nodes and hence create the XML. But this would hardwire the report strcture.p  pAll the classes exposed by Ant seem to work with Junit3 and does not seem to separate the concerns of executing tests and reporting results, hence they force execution XMLResultAggregator.p  ol liIs there a standard way of doing this A library exposed by Ant or Junitli liIs there an alternative approach Ant is not an option for meli ol  pThanks in advance.p
Negative 114 pIn xcode 4.2, if you set up a new project for both iPhone and iPad and choose to create a new iOS MasterDetail Application Xcode will set up a lot of template code for you. The iOS version of the application has a different simpler storyboard. I want the detail view of my application to also be a Table View controlled by a table controller and I want the cells of this table view to automatically resize with an orientation change. The problem is that while this works for the iPhone version of the application, it doesnt work for the iPad version.p  pPreconditions p  pIf you edit the detail view on the iPhone storyboard so that it contains a Table View Controller and define the table view to contain a single prototype cell  set the prototype cell to be of a custom type and add some subviews to it then define those subviews with auto resize properties for example two buttons  one fixed to the left side of the view, the other to the right margin of the view. Do the same for detail view of the iPad storyboard which of course is contained in a more complex split view controller arrangement. p  pDouble check all the view controllers have resize view from NIB selected which they do by default and all the views have Autoresize Subviews selected.p  pExpectedp  pWhen the application is compiled for either iPhone or iPad, in both cases the table cell and its subviews should resize on orientation change. p  pActual Resultp  pOn the iPad version of the app the table cell does not relayout to match the changed size of the UITable view. The table cell on the iPhone version of the app behaves as expected.p  pIts clear the chain of subview layout for nested views is broken such that relayout subviews is not occurring or getting called all the way down to the table view cell when an orientation change occurs. Anyone know if this can be fixed in Interface Builder or if not what code is required to reestablish the chain I know how I can fix this using willRotateToInterfaceOrientationduration , in my own custom subclass of UITableViewController but Im not sure doing it this way is clean and I would prefer not to have partial automation of orientation changes with scraps of code providing workarounds for stuff I think it should be possible to automate.p
Negative 114 pIm attempting to use Maven to deploy my Javadocs which are created successfully to a Sharepoint server, which requires NTLM authentication.  Im using the Maven Wagon plugin with the WebDAV provider to do this.  I am using m2eclipse to set up a run configuration to execute goals within a specific profile.p  pIve essentially pieced together a solution from various solutions Ive found regarding these tools.  It sounds as though NTLM may not be supported at all with Maven currently, but other pages have suggested that the  tag may allow for this.  Ive also seen solutions where the deployment site is specified in distribution management, contrary to Apaches usage page for it.  At any rate, Im encountering a number of problems.p  pFirst of all, when I run from the run configuration menu which executes clean and package within the release profile, the Wagon plugin, which contains an execution of the wagonupload goal within the package phase, the execution is ignored. It creates the project jar and the Javadocs, and attaches the sources, but the Wagon plugin does not execute.p  pIve also attempted to run the wagonupload goal on its own once the Javadocs have been created separately, but I encounter this error in debugp  precode[DEBUG] Configuring mojo org.codehaus.mojowagonmavenplugin1.0beta3upload from plugin realm

Negative 114 pI has searched extensively so forgive me if I am asking a duplicate question. I cannot find an answer to the following.p  pI am using the Xcode repository GUI with the latest version of Xcode instead of the command line. I did an initial pull of the rep without a problem. I made some changes to the local files. At the same time, my other developer made some changes. I committed my changes to the local rep but needed his changes to  do a proper build. We only have 1 branch.p  pI tried to pull and the Xcode UI reports 6 conflicts which is what I would expect as I need the 6 files to do the proper build. p  pMy question is how to resolve the conflicts I read online I should be able to use the left and right button at the bottom of screen to let me pick which file version. I went through all of the 6 files and used the proper buttons to choose which changes I wanted.p  pHowever the Pull button in the lower right hand corner is disabled and greyed out.p  pCan anyone help me outp  pThanks G p

Negative 114 pI want to create a chart and i am using the charts from the toolbox in Visual studio 2010. This is the first time i am trying to do this and so far i have learned the basics of the chart like how to create datapoints and add them to the series in order to get the chart. What i wanted to know is that if its possible to make the datapoints visible to the user like the dots in a point chart and the user to be able to click on a datapoint and get a specific result. What i was thinking is that since i am creating the datapoint is there an option to make it clickable or do i have to create seperate mouseclick events for every datapoint. Excuse me for my ignorance but i am new to this. Where can i find a guide that will help me to create the chart. Here is a part of my code so farp  precodechart1.Series[0].IsVisibleInLegend  false chart1.Series[0].ChartType  SeriesChartType.FastLine  DateTime sday  Convert.ToDateTimeearnings1.dataGridView1[0, 0].Value.ToString chart1.Series[0].XValueType  ChartValueType.String int i  0         foreach DataGridViewRow dgvr in earnings1.dataGridView1.Rows                      decimal testing  Convert.ToDecimalearnings1.dataGridView1[1, i].Value             testing  decimal.Truncatetesting              var point  new DataPointi1, Convert.ToDoubletesting              point.Label  testing.ToString             point.Font  new FontCentury Gothic, 8, FontStyle.Bold             chart1.Series[0].Points.Addpoint             chart1.Series[0].Points[i].AxisLabel  sday.ToStringddMMyyyy             sday  sday.AddDays1             i            codepre  pwhat i am doing is that i have a datagridview with 2 columns. One with the date and the other column with a decimal number. I created a chart with the dates on the x axis custom labeled since the dates are from a mysql database and the format is yyyymmdd and i convert it to ddMMyyyy and on the y axis the values. I am creating a datapoint a each day with its value aand i plot them on the chart. How can i click now on the points so that for example when i click on the value at 24May2012 to do something like show some other information from the database at that specific date. Thank you in advance for your support, any help will be truly appreciated. Sincerely George Georgioup

Negative 114 pstrongBackground informationstrongp  pI have just started learning HLSL and decided to test what I have learned from the Internet by writing a simple 2D XNA 4.0 bullethell game.p  pI have written a pixel shader in order to change the color of bullets.p  pHere is the idea the original texture of the bullet is mainly black, white and red. With the help of my pixel shader, bullets can be much more colorful.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comyeAUh.png altIdeap  pBut, Im not sure how and when the shader is applied on spriteBatch in XNA 4.0, and when it ends. This may be the cause of problem. There were pass.begin and pass.end in XNA 3.x, but pass.apply in XNA 4.0 confuses me.p  pIn addition, it is the first time for me to use renderTarget. It may cause problems.p  pstrongSymptomstrongp  pIt works, but only if there are bullets of the same color in the bullet list. If bullets of different colors are rendered, it produces wrong colors.p  pIt seems that the pixel shader is not applied on the bullet texture, but applied on the renderTarget, which contains all the rendered bullets.p  pFor an example img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com6snGY.jpg altScreenshot Here I have some red bullets and blue bullets. The last created bullet is a blue one. It seems that the pixel shader have added blue color on the red ones, making them to be blueviolet.p  pIf I continuously create bullets, the red bullets will appear to be switching between red and blueviolet. I believe that the blue ones are also switching, but not obvious.p  pstrongCodestrongp  pSince I am new to HLSL, I dont really know what I have to provide.

Negative 114 pI have some problem that bother me for few days..p  pI need to do the following.. start a process with some arguments, find the window of the process, take a picture of that window, and kill the process and I need to repeat this operation X times..p  pI can start the process, using user32 find its main handle, get the window size, so I know the size of the image, set the window position to 0,0, and make it topMost, and than copyFromScreen metod to capture that image.. from 0,0, to size of the window..p  pSo it look like everything is ok, but there is one problem that I cant solve..p  pwhen the process is started, I notice that to use the setWindowPos native function, some time should pass so I use Thread.sleepx seconds, but that time is different on every system.. and that is the problem.. I must know how long delay to make on every system.. and I cant let big unnecceary delay because the process repeats hundreds of times.. and every millisecond is important,p  pPlease if You have some solution, I will be happy to hear..p  pthe process is opera mobile emulator.. other solution is to use sendMessage, and change the url, instead of starting the process over and over.. and I will wait once, but that also doesnt work.. using Spy I try to find details about the process, like className .. and it says invalid window.. so I probably cant use sendMessage too..p

Negative 114 pIm new to iPhone programming. And, im trying to make a game with like 200 levels. I want to use modal segueing because i dont want the naviagational bar at the top, and also i want the cross dissolve animation. Say I have vc one. And then I have vc 2p  pok, so vc 1 segues modally to vc 2p  pand then i have a button on vc 2 to segue back to vc 1p  pso, does the program know to pop vc 2 off the stack or did i just create a memory leak so that now vc1, vc2, and vc1 are on the stack instead of just vc1.p  pand then still also if i had vc1 to vc2, and vc2 to vc3, and in vc3 i have a button that goes back to vc 1, will the program pop both vc 2 and vc 3 off the stack or will 4 be on the stack And  anyways, since with a modal segue theres no real back button like in a navigational push segue theres always a back button on the navigational bar, does modal segueing even have a stackp  pI mean, or is it independent Like, say vc segues to vc2, and vc2 to vc3. Now, is vc 2, and 1 even on the stack or is it just vc3p  psorry, im just a little confuzzled about all this, and im not sure how to make my game. Because if i have 100 view controllers with different levels, then surely in order to have modal segueing I would need to code some popping off vcs off the stack each time i segue right, so that i dont end up with 100s of controllers on the stack And i dont even know how to tell my program how to pop off view controllers.p

I have a div that has 2 things occur when you hover over it  1  It gains some CSS formatting via the hover pseudo class, and 2 an overlay with some information about the image pops up on the bottom of the image via jQuery.p  pThis works just fine in all the modern browsers, but open it up in IE 7 or 8.  Mouseover the frame.  If you mouseout over the top of the frame, there are no problems  the overlay disappears and the CSS formatting gets removed.  But if your mouse passes directly over the overlay while youre mousing out, the hover formatting stays.  jQuery knows that you moused out because the overlay gets removed, but IE doesnt because the CSS hover formatting remains.  Any thoughtsp

I introduced another BitmapData, that is scaled to a round number, than draw the moviclips frame on itscaled, and than that object is drawn on the sprite sheet.   I updated the function with the new code. If someone has another solution, I would really like to know.p
Negative 114 pAfter a cursory inspection, it seems like SLF4J and Guice well, any DI framework, really are sort of conflicting philosophies. SLF4J takes the approach emhey, we wont know until runtime what classes were going to bind to, and thats OK.em Guice, on the other hand, seems to say emhey, we need to know at compiletime exactly what classes were binding to.em.p  pSo I ask is it possible to use GuiceSpringwhatever DI framework to configureinject SLF4J bindingsp  pThe kicker is that the Java codeClassLoadercode is what is really injecting SLF4J at runtime with the proper LoggerLoggerFactoryetc. objects, so I cant figure out how to inject those ClassLoaders so that they returns the codeorg.slf4j.impl.Loggercode that I want at runtimep  pI ask because I like the benefit of SLF4J and logging against an API, but also like the benefits of DI. Is there a way to make this work Thanks in advancep

Negative 114 pIm creating an app based on storyboard, where each of the views has quite a lot of large images. The app crashes not a lot, it usually crashes after 1015 minutes of intensive use after having displayed a few memory warning.  Ive checked instruments, and its not reporting any single memory leak. Also, the allocation seems to be reasonable Ive only got 1 or 2 peaks in the game when I load some very xib containing very big images  around 8mo for the iPad retina version.  I dont really have any objects I can release when I receive a memory warning, as all the stuff from the previous view has already been deallocated. p  pIve seen that similar problem, but it seems to be related to a specific line of code, which is not my case  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10698055iosappcrashingaftermemorywarninginstrumentsshowingnoleaksiOS  App crashing after Memory Warning  Instruments showing no leaksap  pIs there a way to force xcode to clean the images that are cached Otherwise, what can I do to prevent these crashesp  pThanks for your help p
Negative 114 pI have made simple UDP Client  Server application. The client send server a text message. All works fine. My question is when I open Wireshark, i see that total length of the packet  is bigger then I see it in code and I assume that this is because of the header that being append to the data. Is there any way to get the full packet header  payload on server side I seen multiple threads on winpcap but its not what Im looking for. I need UDP listener that will receive data with header as byte array.p

Negative 114 pI have a div the has overflow hidden and webkitoverflowscrolling touch. The problem is that zindex is being ignored on elements some elements. This seemed to start with iOS6 on the iPad 2. I dont remember this being a problem with iOS 5. Heres a jsfiddle link You will need to scroll horizontally to see the whole page.p  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netvkt9U relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netvkt9Uap  pThe full code is also below the textp  pNow to see the problem, swipe horizontally across the black squares. You should see the off screen content come into view, BUT the yellow boxes that were off screen are no longer below the black box  until they scrolling has come to a complete stop. Then the yellow boxes obey the zindex that is set for them.p  pThis is a pared down code from a site in development. I tried to get just the parts that are relevant to the problem. Any idea on this would be greatly appreciated.

Negative 114 pAs a SharePoint developer I am reviewing a browserenabled InfoPath 2010 form published to a SharePoint Online Office 365 environment.br The InfoPath form contains several controls  textboxes, rich textboxes, dropdown listboxes, multipleselection listboxes, date pickers and persongroup pickers  and is published to a SharePoint Form Library. The users are facing the issue that whenever one control has been changed and loses focus, the form is getting a postback. Some of the postbacks are as expected, because another field will be updated because of a rule conditional validation, formatting or action. But other postbacks I cannot explain. Trying to set the controls property Browser forms  Postback settings to Never will not solve the issue.br Additional information  the dropdown listboxes and the multipleselection listboxes receive their data by using a data connection that is bound to a SharePoint list adapter. On several dropdown listboxes and multipleselection listboxes a filter is set.br Maybe you can give me a clue p

Negative 114 pIm trying to implement the ActiveDirectoryMembership provider so I can use forms authentication against active directory.  p  pI can browse to the application, and be redirected to the signin page.  If I enter the incorrect password I get the correct error.

So I know for sure that it is authenticating against AD correctly, but still taking me back to the signin page.

Negative 114 pCreate a shell script sorter.sh that loops through all items in a directory given by the user using the read builtin. This input needs to be able to accept directories using a tilde. The script must validate the input and use a loop to only allow the script to proceed after the validation is complete. It must validate that the directory given is a directory.p  pThe script, while iterating over the items in the directory, should test the items to see if they are directories or files. If they are directories then they need to be renamed to add the current date to the end of the directory name. If they are files they need to be copied into another directory given by the user and force testing purposes must be the path Desktopsorted. Note that you can not hard code this directory path into the program, you must use the variable taken in from the user. Inside this other directory your script must also create directories named with the starting of cis90 and the ending of a through z. So the first three directories would be cis90a, cis90b, cis90c. The files that are getting copied need to be copied into the folders alphabetically. All files beginning with the letter a go into the cis90a folder, files beginning with the letter b go into the cis90b folder, files beginning with the letter c go into the cis90c directory. In order to save you some extra work after you get to c all additional files should go into the cis90d directory. p  pIve got as far as where i need to go over the items for directories and files.

Negative 114 pOne of the modules in an app Im working on is intended to be used as a longrunning process on Linux, and I would like it to gracefully handle SIGTERM, SIGHUP and possibly other signals.

Negative 114 pI have relatively small index about 1 mln documents for high load site. Im running relatively complex function queries against it and performance is not acceptable. So Im hesitation about moving current masterslaves topology to SolrCloud with at least 3 shards and n replicas so all function queries will be distributed across shards and response time should be at least 3 times smaller plus small footprint on merging result setsIs it true.  So my question is it worth shardingand adding complexity to solve performance problems not index size problemsmost common reason to shard your index. p

Negative 114 pIm building a MVC4 app, Ive used EF5 model first, and kept it pretty simple. This isnt going to a huge application, there will only ever be 4 or 5 people on it at once and all users will be authenticated before being able to access any part of the application, its very simply a place order  dispatcher sees order  dispatcher compeletes order sort of application. p  pBasically my question is do I need to be worrying about repositories and ViewModels if the size and scope of my application is so small. Any view that is strongly typed to a domain entity is using all of the properties within that entity. Im using TryOrUpdateModel in my controllers and have read some things saying this can cause a lot of problems, but not a lot of information on exactly what those problems can be. I dont want to use an incredibly complicated pattern for a very simple app. p  pHopefully Ive given enough detail, if anyone wants to see my code just ask, Im really at a roadblock here though, and could really use some advice from the community.

They run windows. Occasionally my forget to disable wireless networking on their laptop when theres a cable to the machine. I have been told that this may cause trouble. Occasionally remember to disable wireless, but then they will disconnect their laptop from the network altogether to go to a meeting where they reconnect.p  pI need help to figure out which exceptions should be ignored by the program, and which are important enough to let the program crash. And if I should bother retry the operation before letting the program crash.p  pSo.. basically I would like to know the difference between the two exceptions. p

Negative 114 pIm pretty new to elasticsearch and have been banging my head trying to get this sorting to work. The general idea is to search email message threads with nested messages and nested participants. The goal is to display search results at the thread level, sorting by the participant who is doing the search and either the lastreceivedat or lastsentat column depending on which mailbox they are in.p  pMy understanding is that you cant sort by a single childs value among many nested children. So in order to do this I saw a couple of suggestions for using a customscore with a script, then sorting on the score. My plan is to dynamically change the sort column and then run a nested customscore query that will return the date of one of the participants as the score. Ive been noticing some issues with both the score format being strange eg. always has 4 zeros at the end and it may not be returning the date that I was expecting.p  pBelow are simplified versions of the index and the query in question. If anyone has any suggestions, Id be very grateful. FYI  I am using elasticsearch version 0.20.6.p  pIndexp  precodemappings      messagethread          properties              id                  type long                          subject                  dynamic true                 properties                      id                          type long                                          name                          type string                                                                participants                  dynamic true                 properties                      id                          type long                                          name                          type string                                          lastsentat                          format dateOptionalTime                         type date                                          lastreceivedat                          format dateOptionalTime                         type date                                                                messages                  dynamic true                 properties                      sender                          dynamic true                         properties                              id                                  type long                                                                                                id                          type long                                          body                          type string                                          createdat                          format dateOptionalTime                         type date                                          recipient                          dynamic true                         properties                              id                                  type long                                                                                                                      version                  type long                             codepre  pQueryp  precode   query      bool        must [                    term  participants.id 3785          ,                    customscore              query                filtered                  query  matchall  ,                 filter                    term  participants.id 3785                                              ,             params  sortcolumn participants.lastreceivedat ,             script doc[sortcolumn].value                           ]        ,   filter      bool        must [                    term  messages.recipient.id 3785                 ]        ,   sort [ score ]  codepre  pstrongSolutionstrongp  pThanks to imotov, here is the final result. The participants were not properly nested in the index while the messages didnt need to be. In addition, includeinroot was used for the participants to simplify the query participants are small records and not a real size issue, although imotov also provided an example without it.

At each of these steps, there are possible user inputs e.g., weights, selecting relevant rows, etc.. Ive got the basic analysis set up, but my goal is to deploy this in a multiuser environment. What I dont want to have happen is for one user to set their inputs, have another user change some inputs, and both get unexpected results.p  pWhen a user enters an application, Id like them to get a copy of all of the main database tables as they stand when beginning a session, then be able to change all of the inputs possibly even adding raw data, running an analysis and generating output that is kept separate from all other users output.

Then, if the user wants to make the changes they made to the actual database tables which all other users will see, they can commit some or all of their changes.p  pIm an Oracle and APEX newbie and have been reading all the documentation and books I can lay my hands on, but need help identifying good approaches to this problem, or at least relevant reading.p

At the same time we created a branch of our code base, one that we needed to work on in VS 2010 for legacy support and bug fixes, and the current version that would be worked on 2012.

In regards to the property I have 2 tablesp  ul liproperty stores the idproperty, iduser, name, description, address, etc...li lipropertyimages stores idproperty, idimage, path, uploaddateli ul  pWhat I need is AJAX code that will show the images, one at a time, until the user clicks on the image itself or on a strongnextpreviousstrong  button underneath it, creating a slideshow, and automatically fill in a hidden textbox with the idimage of the current image, so the user can click on a buttonlink that will delete the image from the database.p  pstrongThis is my code so farstrongp  precodeltphp

Negative 114 pI want to send different XML message strings based on the time. I have thought of implementing a data structure in JAVA and put all the XML messages in it with the time when they should be sent out. I want to use sorted data structure so that everytime the message comes inside the data structure, it gets sorted and while sending out I can check their respective times and take the messages out. I want to know which data structure would be most efficient and how can I implement it.  Also how can I put time in secounds with each XML string.p  pIt is likep  precodeMessage 1, time to send T  1   put to the data structure Message 2, time to send T  4   put to the data structure Message 3, time to send T  3   put to the data structure.... codepre  pThere will be a separate thread that will check the messages in the data structure every second and remove all the messages which qualifies to come out.p

Negative 114 pI am getting stuck with images not displaying with their products. When I create a product and insert an image with that product manually through manage products the image shows which is great.  However we have over 1000 product images which need to be uploaded, all the product information is already up I just need to add the images  I have exported the products CSV file and the working image address is ngimage1.jpg I have then copied that but change the image to image2.jpg, image3.jpg etc. I then uploaded the new images into that folder directory on our server thinking thats enough. I then upload the CSV file blow the cache and reindex the data however no new images show and worse the working image doesnt display. I have filled in image, smallimage and thumbnail details in the CSV. All images are correctly sized etc.p  pFurther more can allow tell me where I can just have 1 image folder in the directory where all my images are stored Thanksp  pIm using Magento version 1.7.0.2p

Negative 114 pI have recently transitioned from Java to C, and I am having some difficulties working out how class inheritance works exactly. Currently, I have the class codeWeaponcode and the class codeMiniguncode. codeMiniguncode inherits the class codeWeaponcode, which means it should have the methods and variables that codeWeaponcode defines. My issue is that I have a private constant static int inside codeWeaponcode called coderatecode, and a public method that returns an integer called codegetRatecode. codegetRatecode simply returns the rate variable as defined in the class. When codeMiniguncode extends codeWeaponcode, and I set the rate inside codeMiniguncode, the codegetRatecode method still returns the constant from the codeWeaponcode class, even though it is being called on the codeMiniguncode class. I thought it would act like Java, and the intherited method would use the modified variable inside codeMiniguncode. Currently I have to do the followingp  pstrongWeapon.hstrongp  precodeifndef WEAPON define WEAPON  class Weapon      public         virtual int getRate                      return rate              private         const static int rate  0   endif codepre  pstrongMinigun.hstrongp  precodeinclude Weapon.h  ifndef WEAPONMINIGUN define WEAPONMINIGUN  class Minigun public Weapon  public     int getRate  I have to define this here, and create it inside Minigun.cpp private     const static int rate  30   endif codepre  pstrongMinigun.cppstrongp  precodeinclude Minigun.h  int MinigungetRate  Is there a way so I do not need to type this out for every class that extends Weapon      return rate  codepre

Negative 114 pIm writing an application that is intended to embed audio or preferably video in a windows form.p  pRight now I am using the standard MediaPlayer class xWMPLib.AxWindowsMediaPlayer MediaPlayer  and am finding that it may not have some of the functionality that I am hoping for.p  pOne of the features I would like to have in this application is unadulterated scrubbing of said audio or video... Which in this context I would define as the ability to scrub the video without stopping playback  or otherwise, continuing to play audio or video While scrubbing...p  pExamples of this can be seen in programs such as Adobe Premier in which you can scrub the position of your video on the timeline, and at whatever rate you are scrubbing, it will play back some garbled audio. p  pThe intention in this feature is to grant someone the ability to  using a foot pedal, in one instance  roll back in the media and know exactly where they are, based on audio feedback...p  pThis particular feature is very specific and debatable in its ability to be achieved, but the core of the question here is this What would be your suggestions for a more fully featured media player that can be utilized in a C windows formp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 114 pI suspect the answer to this is very simple, but for whatever reason, Im a bit baffled by it.p  pI am trying to generate a unique 20 char alphanumeric hash value.  I have tried multiple ways to generate a random value via PHP, but I am still getting duplicates.  I was temporarily trying a process in which I query the table before the insert, pull the most recent primary key value, increase it by one and then use that as part of the generated hash value.

Negative 114 pI manage a site www.abc.com which already has a SSL certificate which is expiring in 2 weeks. So I created a .CSR from the existing .JKS file and sent it to the CA. I got back a .PEM and imported the pem file to the existing jks and deleted the old certificate in jks.p  pWhen I installed the new jks in web logic server 10.3.6 it threw exception saying the keystore does not have the private key. What would have caused this Deleting the old certificate using its alias would have deleted the private key as well Is there a way to check the validity of jks before installing it p  pRegards, Arunp
Negative 114 pI have a library written in C that I need to turn into a DLL. This library should be able to be modified and recompiled with different compilers and still work.p  pI have read that its very unlikely that I will achieve full binary compatibility between compilersversion if I export all my classes directly using declspecdllexport.p  pI have also read that pure virtual interfaces can be pulled from the DLL to remove the issue of name mangling by simply passing a table full of function pointers. However, I have read that even this can fail, because some compilers may even change the order of the functions in the vtable between successive releases.p  pSo finally, I figured I could just implement my own vtable, and this is where I am atp  pstrongTest.hstrongp  precodepragma once include ltiostreamgt using namespace std  class TestItf extern C declspecdllexport TestItf cdecl CreateTest  class TestItf  public     static TestItf Create          return CreateTest          void Destroy          thisgtvptrgtDestroy          void Printconst char something          thisgtvptrgtPrintsomething          TestItf          cout ltlt TestItf dtor ltlt endl          typedef voidTestItfpfnDestroy     typedef voidTestItfpfnPrintconst char something      struct vtable          pfnDestroy Destroy         pfnPrint Print          protected     const vtable const vptr     TestItfvtable vptr  vptrvptr   extern Cdeclspecdllexport void cdecl GetTestVTableTestItfvtable vtable codepre  pTest.cppp  precodeinclude Test.h  class TestImp  public TestItf  public     static TestItfvtable TestImpvptr     TestImp  TestItfampTestImpvptr            TestImp          cout ltlt TestImp dtor ltlt endl          void Destroy          delete this          void Printconst char something          cout ltlt something ltlt endl        TestItfvtable TestImpTestImpvptr        TestItfpfnDestroyampTestImpDestroy,     TestItfpfnPrintampTestImpPrint,   extern C      declspecdllexport void cdecl GetTestVTableTestItfvtable vtable          memcpyvtable, ampTestImpTestImpvptr, sizeofTestItfvtable          declspecdllexport TestItf cdecl CreateTest          return new TestImp       codepre  pmain.cppp  precodeint mainint argc, char argv[]      TestItf itf  TestItfCreate     itfgtPrintHello World     itfgtDestroy      return 0  codepre  pWere my above assumptions correct about not being able to achieve proper compatibility with the first two methodsp  pIs my 3rd solution portable and safep  pSpecifically, I am worried about the effect of using the casted function pointers from TestImp on the base type TestItf.

Negative 114 pI have an MVC3 project wherein Id like to use custom validation attributes for client and serverside processing.  Ive followed the steps found at a hrefhttpthewayofcode.wordpress.com20120118customunobtrusivejqueryvalidationwithdataannotationsinmvc3 relnofollowhttpthewayofcode.wordpress.com20120118customunobtrusivejqueryvalidationwithdataannotationsinmvc3a.  That was a great tutorial and it actually works perfectly.p  pThe only problem Im having is that my validations dont seem to trigger until strongafterstrong the form has been submitted.  I have client and serverside validation.  The serverside validation is a combination of validation attributes and custom validation sometimes I have to check the input value against something in the database, for example.  The first time I click the Save button on my form using Ajax.BeginForm the post happens to the server, the serverside validation kicks in and returns validation messages because the input is invalid.  If I leave the form inputs exactly as they are and I click the Save button again, the clientside validation works properly and prevents the post from happening.p  pWhat could be causing the clientside validation to be skipped until after the form is postedp  pMy custom validation attributep  precode    public class RequiredIfContainsAttribute  ValidationAttribute, IClientValidatable

Negative 114 pI originally couldnt think of a way to append an additional class to an li element which had a class that other li elements had. I wanted to only add a class to that specific li element that I clicked a select button on and the solution was On the click of the button, you can use .closest to find the ancestor li element. The solution was a jquery solution and it works fine but now Im having an additional problem. First, heres what I originally posted and the solution I was given along with the fiddle and then I will explain what my new problem is and would appreciate the help. So my original postp  pOk so my script allows me to input text in a textarea element and add it to a li element within an ordered list with the id Glist. Not only is text added to each li I add to the ordered list, but the additional things below are added as well and they all just display additional images using CSS. One of the classes, Selimg displays a sprite image of a button that says select. Now each li element I add to my ol has all of the elements below as well as the classes. So each li element will have a div with a Selimg class that displays an image of a button that says select for example. When I click this div with the class Selimg, a new class named Selected will be added to the div which will change the background color of the li to indicate that it has been selected. The problem is, I want to only add the Selected class to the div with the Selimg class that Ive clicked, not all li elements with Selimg classes. How can I do that with an onclick event handler or any other way using js or jquery Heres the htmlp  precodeltol idGListgt    ltli classMyListgt       ltp classbulletpgtltpgt       ltThis Selimg class displays an image of a button that says selectgt       ltdiv classSelimggtltdivgt       ltWhen a user presses this select button, I want to append a class only to the specific li element the user has pressed the select button on. gt       ltdiv classedit1gtltdivgt       ltdiv classDelgtltdivgt       ltdiv classprogressgtltdivgt       ltdiv classShowMoregtltdivgt       ltdiv classCheckedGoalgtltdivgt       ltdiv classPCompetePercentgtltdivgt       ltdiv classShowMoreBlockgtltdivgt       ltdiv classgoalTxtgtltdivgt    ltligt ltolgt  The solution I was given   On the click of the button, you can use .closest to find the ancestor li element  .Selimg.click function     this.closestli.addClasssomeclasss    or this.parent.addClasssomeclasss since the li is the parent of the button  codepre  pheres the fiddle demonstrating the solution a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netarunpjohnyfSMDv2 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netarunpjohnyfSMDv2ap  pAnd now for the new issue. For some reason, the jquery solution was not working on its own. Somehow, the jquery code above only worked when I placed it into a js function like this p  precodeltscriptgt   function runSel       var li  .Selimg.closestli.addClassliselected      li.siblings.removeClassliselected    ltscriptgt codepre  pI also have a function thats called whenever I want to add another item to the list. p  precodeThis is only the part of the code that creates the div that I style to look like and be used as a button that says select. Theres more code that also creates the li element itself and a few additional things but all for design. Nothing important.  var Selimg  document.createElementdiv  Selimg.setAttributeclass, Selimg Selimg.setAttributeonclick, runSel entry.appendChildSelimg codepre  pWhat this does is, create the div with the class Selimg which will be an image of a select button added to my list item and then its given the onclick attribute that calls the runSel function above as you can see. It works. However it only works once. The fiddle example demonstrates what Im looking for. So now, when I add an item to the list, and click the select button on it, the function runSel is called which adds a class called liselected and liselected just changes the background color because the rules for each property in the css, have important so the background color overrides the current one. It works, but like I said it only works once. After I add another item, and press the Select button on that one which is made from the styles from the Selimg class, the liselected class is removed from the other li element yet the second li element that I just clicked the select button on, only causes the liselected class to be removed from the first but its not added after that to the second li item, the current one. So, when i add multiple li, they will contain things like text and a div styled to look like a button that says select and so when I click select on an li, I want then for that specific li to have the liselected class appended and when I select the select button on another li, I want the class liselected to be removed from the other li element it was on and added to that one. p

Instead, it appears that the realtime API thinks it is in a valid state and makes modifications locally, but does not resync with the remote server.p  precode Valid Auth Token Object state , accesstoken ya29.AHES6ZS38RR9kVXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, tokentype Bearer, expiresin 3600, clientid XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.apps.googleusercontent.com aa 1 accesstoken ya29.AHES6ZS38RR9kVXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX clientid XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.apps.googleusercontent.com cookiepolicy undefined expiresat 1381916402 expiresin 3600 gusercookiepolicy undefined issuedat 1381912802 responsetype token scope Array[3] state  tokentype Bearer   Current Time Date.now 1381912845180 [Wed Oct 16 2013 014045 GMT0700 Pacific Daylight Time]   ltltComputer Sleep For Hoursgtgt Uncaught Error Authentication error No token set api462  Drive Realtime API Error tokenrefreshrequired The OAuth token must be refreshed. api464 Doc Load Error  Rw type tokenrefreshrequired, message The OAuth token must be refreshed., b false, isFatal false    ltltRefresh OAuth Tokengtgt   Current Time Date.now 1381959164975 [Wed Oct 16 2013 143244 GMT0700 Pacific Daylight Time]   Valid Auth Token Object state , accesstoken ya29.AHES6ZRkwocCBwxjh7Zx2XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, tokentype Bearer, expiresin 3600, clientid XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.apps.googleusercontent.com aa 1 accesstoken ya29.AHES6ZRkwocCBwxjh7Zx2XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX clientid XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.apps.googleusercontent.com cookiepolicy undefined expiresat 1381962143 expiresin 3600 gusercookiepolicy undefined issuedat 1381958543 responsetype token scope Array[3] state  tokentype Bearer   Current Value LOCAL.data.gett 0.502 Beta 3   Editing Value LOCAL.data.sett, 0.502 Beta 4 Mm a 0.502 Beta 3, Ma Object, K function, oa function, J function   Edit Worked LOCAL.data.gett 0.502 Beta 4   ltltRefresh Pagegtgt   Current Value LOCAL.data.gett 0.502 Beta 3 codepre  pMaking edits to the realtime model works after the OAuth refresh, but the edits do not persist.

Negative 114 pTo start off this was a homework assignment, keyword was, past due now and unfortunately submitted as is.

I have then rewind the file and began to copy the contents line by line into a separate variable named temp. Then this is where it gets a little muddy, although I thought I was doing this correctly, perhaps my calloc isnt quite right, Im not sure, but I thought the items were then copied into the appropriate array through for and if statements. All that seems to work finewithout fault but when I attempt to print out the array I get a Segmentation Fault. p  pIm not sure in what part I am messing up.

Negative 114 pI tend to start projects that are far beyond what I am capable of doing, bad habit or a good way to force myself to learn, I dont know. Anyway, this project uses a postgresql database, python and sqlalchemy. I am slowly learning everything from sql to sqlalchemy and python. I have started to figure out models and the declarative approach, but I am wondering what is the easiest way to populate the database with data that needs to be there from the beginning, such as an admin user for my project How is this usually donep  pEditp  pPerhaps this question was worder in a bad way. What I wanted to know was the possible ways to insert initial data in my database, I tried using sqlalchemy and checking if every item existed or not, if not, insert it. This seemed tedious and cant be the way to go if there is a lot of initial data. I am a beginner at this and what better way to learn is there than to ask the people who do this regularly how they do it Perhaps not a good fit for a question on stackoverflow, sorry.p

Negative 114 pI have a Google maps widget that includes html, css, and javascript that will need to be present everywhere that this map is used.

Negative 114 pI am completely new to OWIN authentication, and I must be misunderstanding how everything works, but I cant find this mentioned anywhere.p  pAll I want is to be able to use a central domain for authentication. If someone tries to access codeapps.domain.comcode when not authenticated, they will be redirected to codeaccounts.domain.comlogincode so that all the authentication is separated into its own domain and application. This was very easy with MVC 4 forms authentication where you can specify a full URL, but doesnt seem to be with OWIN.p  pIn codeStartup.Auth.cscodep  precodeapp.UseCookieAuthenticationnew CookieAuthenticationOptions      LoginPath  new PathStringaccountlogin  codepre  pIts easy to specify the domain when setting the cookie with the codeCookieDomaincode option. However, when you specify the login path to redirect to, it has to be relative to the current application, so how do I go about accomplishing what was so easy in MVC 4 forms authenticationp  pWithout getting too deep into what OWIN authentication is all about, I could not find anything addressing this after a couple hours of searching.p

Negative 114 pI have a codeJavacode thread with a run method that computes many things. You can think of it as a series of math statements as follows. Note that each computation may utilize other methods that in turn might have additional loops and such.p  precodepublic void run     [computation 1 goes here here that takes a few seconds]    [computation 2 goes here that takes a few seconds]    ....    [computation 30 goes here that takes a few seconds]  codepre  pThere is a codeGUIcode that prints the output of these statements as they produce their results, and Id like the user to be able to say Stop whenever they want. Here are two methods I thought ofp  hr  pstrongMethod 1 Many Boolean Checks [LOOKS TERRIBLE]strongp  precodeprivate boolean stop public void run     ifstop        [computation 1 goes here here that takes a few seconds]    ifstop        [computation 2 goes here that takes a few seconds]    ....    ifstop        [computation 30 goes here that takes a few seconds]  codepre  pIn this method, once the stop flag has been set to true, the computations will end. Note how silly this looks, having 30 codeifcode statements. Importantly, the critical question here is how often to put these conditions. Note that the computations on each line are not necessarily a single line. Taken to the extreme, does EVERY line in the coderuncode method deserve a codeifstopcode call above it This doesnt seem like good design.p  pstrongMethod 2 Generalizing Computations [CANNOT DO THIS]strongp  precodepirivate boolean stop public void run     forint i  0 i lt computationsN ampamp stop i         computuations.geti.compute  codepre  pI imagine that this method will be suggested, so Id like to simply state that it is impossible in my case, given the sheer variation in the lines that I am calling computations for simplicity. I have typically done this for threads that are basic codewhilecode loops, and it works great for such. But not in this case when the coderuncode method is simply a huge method of variable code.p  hr  pAny other solutions out there Seems like this should be a universal problem. Thanks in advancep

When they log out, it will then clear out the codelastSeencode field.p  pWhen the user is idle, I plan to use JavaScript to poll the server every 60 seconds or so to ensure that the record keeps getting refreshed.p  pThree questionsp  ol liWill this work If not, why notli liCan you see any potential security holesli liFor the JavaScript, is there any need for some kind of csrfprotection If so, how should I go about handling thisli ol  pIm pretty concerned about security, so I really would like to know if theres anything Im missing here that could open up security holes.p
Negative 114 pI am trying to figure out the best MQ option for my requirements. I need to have the ability to transfer both text and binary messages within and across geographically diverse data centers with high reliability. Fast is nice but scaling is an option as well. Support is nice to have as with RabbitMQ.p  pHere are some assumptionsp  ol liUse federation or shoveling messages to push identical messages across data centers. li liUse AMQP to transfer binary messages and since we are a .NetPython shop.li ol  pI want to make sure my assumptions are valid and need help with which MQ to pick. I have used ActiveMQMySQL in the past but I like the option of Mnesia for messaging with persistance. Also, is it alright to use AMQP 0.9 instead of 1.0. Looks like RabbitMQ support 1.0 via a plugin.p  pAppreciate any alternate suggestions I can get.p

Negative 114 pI am a bit confused about time complexity of Dynamic Arrays. In this article a hrefhttpbigocheatsheet.com relnofollowherea it states that the time complexity of  insertion and deletion of Dynamic Array is On. I wanted to know why that is the case for insertion and deletion of dynamic array.p  pMy understanding of why the insertion of Dynamic Array might be On is because once an element is inserted the other elements need to be moved back and that is On. However I read somewhere else the reason for this is because in case you run out of space then extra space is reallocated the previous items copied and pasted into the new memory location.I wanted to know which reasoning is correct. Also my reasoning for an array having a time complexity of On for deletion is that once an element is deleted other elements are moved forth to cover the deleted items space.However again the article gives another answer and states that since searching is On in Dynamic array thus deleting is On in dynamic array since an element is searched before its deleted. I would appreciate it if someone could clarify this confusion. Thanks.p

The only difference is the win 8 is installed in a vm. but one of the win7 is also installed in vm.p  pbut if I used p  plist.uNumOfEntries  0p  pthen it is connecting but but not to the bssid I desire.p  pOne thing i noticed when I saw the exported function of the dll wlanapi.dll for both win7 and win 8 using DLL Export Viewerp  pThe number of function in win7 is lesser than in win8.p  pin win7 there is onlyp  precodeWlanConnect codepre  pbut in win8 there is also p  precodeWlanConnect WlanConnectEx WlanConnectWithInput codepre  pbut in the header file wlanapi.h I m using Visual Studio Express 13 WlanConnectEx and WlanConnectWithInput are not there.

The wifi didnt have Win8 driver but only win7 driver. Changed the adapter to one which had a win8 driver and its working now. Though its a little strange that functionality working in an older os will not work in new system no backward compatibility. Or maybe it loaded the xp driver as a generic one. And xp does not support the BSSID list. Unfortunately I checked the original adapter chipset and its an atheros one. The adapter is manufactured by another vendor but chipset is atheros and the required driver is for AR9170. And they are yet to release win8 driver. I tried to find one but couldnt find so far.p  pBut the questions for header file for new function is still applicable. p

Negative 114 pIn my Android app I use the Temboo library to post on users Facebook wall. Everything is OK except when the message contains nonASCII characters. For example, if I try to publish the String Odo, I get on Facebook Odo. I suppose I would need to set the charset for the Temboo library if UTF8 is not the default charset, but I find nothing on the documentation or I am missing something.p

Negative 114 pMy team and I have a problem with the codification of the strings that we are using in our delphi softwarep  pThe string follows the next processp  pDelphi StringSOAPMessageInternetNuSoapSQLServerp  pThe collation of the SQLServer is ModernSpanishCIAS because we are Spaniards. The SOAPMessage has the ISO88561 encoding. p  pSo the fun starts with the specials characters as ,,,etc... p  pWhen we introduce one of these characters in the DB    becomes in    for instance.p  pWe guess that the problem is in the nuSoap parser and PHP because before the message processing in the server we introduce the raw data in a SQL server table and the characters are readable.p  pAll the posts that I read so far related with codification in NuSoap become from people who want to use the Utf8. But the problem is that we want to use ISO88561 encoding. Any idea to introduce this special charactersp
Negative 114 pWPF controls dont seem to have a code.Culturecodeproperty, or any other obvious way of controlling how text is localised.  Worse, on my test machine it doesnt even respect the system locale.  My application needs to work for Germans, so the test machine runs a German version of windows and C respects this.  Thus    p  precodeString.Format0, 3.5  3,5 codepre  pBut if I leave the localisation to WPF, e.g. by binding a numeric property directly to a label or a datagrid cell, I see some kind of American formatting.  So if I format code3.5code as currency then I would see code3.50code onscreen.p  pSop  ul liWhy does WPF use the wrong locale li liHow do I fix it li ul  pIdeally fix means making it respect the system locale by default, while giving me explict control over particular things.  Thus if I have a German invoice opened on an Australian PC, the ideal thing would be for a price to look like code3.50code. p

Negative 114 pI am currently working on a very complex program that has multiple different components, and is deployed on Client site at different stages. Release management is in place, but is a bit fiddly, and I need to change a fairly fundamental component that will impact all other libraries that will be built with it.p  pMy question is, rather than announce it as a breaking change, and forcing all libraries to update to the new component for the next release, Im thinking I could use reflection to see if the new class I am adding exists, if so use it, otherwise carry on using the old method. Then in a couple months time, I will go through and remove this, and remove the old method. This means that the various client teams that are at different stages of deployment wont suddenly find they have to upgrade everything at the same time, or nothing at all.p  pDoes this seem like it would have any obvious drawbacks, is it considered terrible practice to use reflection to detect version, or does this sound okp

Something like thisp  precodevectorltBgt bvec  bvec.emplacebackampobj1.x  obj.x implements C bvec.emplacebacknew YCAdapterampobj2.y  obj.y doesnt implement C bvec.emplacebacknew ZCAdapterampobj3.z  obj.z doesnt implement C ...  510 more of these codepre  pWith these disparate objects collected under a single vector, I can now do useful operations in a consistent way.p  pBut, this code has an obvious memory leak, in that the Adapters are leaked. These are pretty tiny little classes with barely any functionality, and Id prefer not to have to keep a list of these adapters just so I can destroy them later.p  pHow can I have codeBcode can hold pointers or references to codeCcode objects, while owning and destructing adapters but not C base classes Should I disintermediate codeCcode from codeCAdaptercodes with another base class Or should I use some form of smart pointer Or some other solution that my limited C knowledge has failed to providep

Negative 114 pstrongThe problemstrongp  pOk, sorry that my question is somewhat abstract and subjective, but will try to make it as specific as possible. So, the situation I am in is simple  I am remaking a very old MS Access application on a new website using ASP.NET MVC. As currently the MVC site is using SQL Server 2008 for many well known reasons I need to find a way to migrate the tables AND the data, because the information in the old database will be used in the new application. p  pAlright, so far so good, however there are a few problems. The old application is written in a different language, meaning that I want to translate table names, field names, and all other names that are there to English. Furthermore, I will be making some changes on the models themselves change the type of some fields, add additional fields to some tables, remove old unnecessary ones and more. So technically Ill be having my way with everything. p  pstrongResearched solutionsstrongp  pWith those things in mind I researched for the ways to migrate data from Access database to a SQL Server. Of course, there is a lot of information on the matter, in Stack Overflow alone there are more than a few questions and solutions. So why am I struggling to find the answer  Well I found a few solutions that will be sufficient to some extend actually will definitely solve my problems but I am writing to ask if someone experienced has a better perspective on it than I do. Alright, the solutions and why I am still looking for advice Ill be listing just a couple of the most common and popular ones that I found, many of the others share the same capabilities andor results p  ol lipUpsize Wizzard Access  this is a tool devised specifically for migrating tables and data from Access. It is my most favourite one for the moment as I find it kind of straightforward to work with and it provides good overall results. I was able to migrate the tables to SQL Server along with the data of course which more or less is what I am intending to do. It is fast, it seems like it allows you to migrate indexes, primary keys and even to my knowledge foreign keys table relationships. The downsides of this tool, however, include that it ignores your queries which I dont really need honestly and it doesnt provide a way to change the model, names or types of the properties of the table you migrate  which is the thing I kind of prefer, because I will have to make more than a few changes, adding, renaming, deleting, etc. And then continue with the development process of the application which will lead to a few additional minor changes. And finally I would need to apply all changes migration  all changes on the production server, which overall is prone to mistakes as I will be doing it by hand and there are more than a few tables. pli lipSQL Server Migration Assistant SSMA  ok, this is a separate tool not included in Access with again the same idea  to migrate data from Access to ... possibly everywhere, havent researched that. Overall it offers more functionality and customizing from the Upsize Wizard, but of course it does it in a more complicated way. I havent put enough effort to make a migration with this tool yet, as it involves a lot of installations and additional work, but according to my research it provides almost all if not all of the functionality I require. The downside however comes with the naming. As I mentioned it allows you to apply changes on the tables, schema, fields, indexes, keys and probably everything, but the articles advice that I change the names in Access first, as it will be easier and the migration process will run more smoothly. I am not allowed to make changes on the original Access database, as it will remain functional until the publish of the renewed project, and the data inside it is being used, so a mere copy of the file is a solution I am not particularly fond of, because I might loose new records. Also I cant predict the changes I would want to make in the development process as I said I believe I would wantneed to apply some additional changes later on when I find weaknesses in my data design in the development process so I find it to be a little half baked solution. pli ol  pstrongConclusionstrongp  pThe options presented, the way I see them, are two p  ul lipUse the Upsize Wizard to migrate the access tables, then write a script that applies the changes I want to make. Then in the development process add any additional changes to the script. When ready to publish on the production server, reapply the migration with the wizard, run the changes script and pray everything is fine. pli lipGet more involved with the SSMA tool and try producing an updated version of the tables with the migration process. See how efficient the renaming is and decide whether to use copied file to rename and then find a way to migrate only new records or do it all in the SSMA. Then again write a script for the changes that occur in the development process and redo and apply it all on the production server when ready and then pray everything is fine. pli lipOption I have not yet seen, apply it and then pray everything is fine.pli ul  pI have researched the matter for a couple of days now, and found a few more solutions that I do not believe are better by the mentioned. However I include the possibility of missing the big red X on the map, a practical and easy solution which seems like it was designed specifically for me though I doubt that a little. Anyway, reducing all the madness that I have written so far to a few simple questions will look like p  ul lipIs anyone aware if my conclusions are correct I am leaning towards option one as it is easier to accomplish. pli lipHas anyone experiencedfound a better way to do that, or just found some logicleaps in my writings as I am overthinking the entire thing a little and may be doing some obvious miscalculation. pli ul  pVery sorry for asking a trivial question and one that includes decision making that may involve deeper understanding of my project and situation, yet I am working with rather sensitive data and would appreciate feedback, even if only to improve my confidence into the chosen approach. p

Negative 114 pI have a bat script which is rather complex and runs every 15 minutes. It opens a browser, runs an iMacro to sign in and download a file, closes the browser, extracts the file, initiates a javascript which verifies that the downloaded file is more recent than the one downloaded 15 minutes earlier, opens Excel, imports the downloaded file, triggers a very involved VB Script, exports a csv file, closes Excel, opens a new browser, logs in to a 2nd site, uploads the csv file and closes the browser again.p  pMeanwhile Im doing my job, which requires many browser tabs open in several different browsers, and web development software.p  pWhile the script is running, my computer will frequently come to a near standstill, preventing me from doing any other work  presumedly because the CPU usage is maxed out. Not only can I not do other work, but my script frequently fails to complete because the browser is so slow it times out before the page loads.p  pTask Manager tells me that my CPU usage while running the script is 98100 and Im using 7 out of 8 MB of RAM. Obviously, Im pushing my computer to its limits. Is there anything I can do to help minimize the slow down, such as allocate some RAM, partition my hard drive, make a sacrifice to the processor gods, etc. My computer is a 64bit running Windows 7 Pro with 8MB of RAM and a 3.00 GHz processor.  I cant get a new computer but I can probably ask for additional RAM if it would help.p  pI dont know very much about performance optimization, so any suggestions are welcome. I cant stop using the script, run it less often, or run it on a different computer.p

In doing this I bust the highlight functionality.  p  pI have experimented with setPickOnBounds, but from what I understand that only controls whether or not the mouse sees invisible portions of a given Node.  If my understanding is correct that wont work in this case as the drag routine needs to ignore the visible areas of the seriesfalling through to the chart background but not ignore the black Xs XYChart.Data nodes.p  pIs there anyway short of rewriting the mouse handling to make that set of series visible to the mouse without making everything else visiblep

Negative 114 pI have a website that receives quite a bit of usage 600 users a day, so the issue I describe below is not common.  Truth be told, its been reported to me on a few occasions, but I have yet to reproduce the issue myself.  Ive used browserstack.com to test in all various browserOS combinations, but this code has just worked every time...p  pSo heres the scenario.  My website involves vehicle warranties, and the whole process begins with the user entering a Vehicle Identification Number VIN.  VINs are an unholy mix of numbers and letters, but there are always 17 of them.  When the user enters a VIN, I perform some logic that validates the VIN, returns the details of the vehicle, and allow them to validate that theyre working with the intended vehicle.p  pFor the past 6 months, the code below has worked and continues to do so.  When the user enters 17 characters, I call a method called lookupVIN, passing the pertinent information, and returning the validation information to the user.  p  pThe issue is, Ive had a few reports that when the user enters the screen txtVIN is the only textbox on the screen when the page initially loads, the browser immediately locks up.  Ive asked what browsers, and Ive been told IE11Win 8 and ChromeWin 7.  My thinking is that this code below is entering a loop  even though the user has yet to enter a single character in the txtVIN textbox.p  pAre there any reasons this code should be altered based on the scenario described above Are there any safety checks I could be performing to ensure a loop isnt enetered  Any thoughts are welcome, thanksp  precodeNote, all code below is using jQuery 1.10.2 var VinLength  17  txtVIN.bindinput propertychange, function e      if e  e  window.event      Ignore konami code...     if e.keyCode  undefined  e.keyCode  37 ampamp e.keyCode  38 ampamp e.keyCode  39 ampamp e.keyCode  40 ampamp e.keyCode  8 ampamp e.keyCode  46          scrubVINtxtVIN performs trim and such..          if this.val.length  VinLength              lookupVINtxtVIN.val, hidDIN.val Performs VIN lookup                codepre

Negative 114 pI have a C project in Eclipse which the base part of all include directories is different depending on a chosen platform. For example, including includecTable directoryp  ul liabcplatform1includecTable li liabcplatform2includecTableli liabcplatform3includecTableli ul  pSo, what i want to do is to create next build variables windowpreferencesCbuildbuild variablesp  ul liPLATFORMNAMEPLAT1  platform1li liPLATFORMNAMEPLAT2  platform2 li liPLATFORMNAMEPLAT3  platform3li liPLATFORMSELECTED  PLATFORMNAMEPLAT1li liINCLUDEDIR  abcPLATFORMSELECTEDincludeli ul  pThen, using the project properties, C generalpaths and symbolsincludes, add include directories that wayp  ul liINCLUDEDIRcTableli liINCLUDEDIRcRowli liINCLUDEDIRcComponentBaseli liINCLUDEDIRcTimersli ul  pThat way, when changing the platform, i only have to edit the PLATFORMSELECTED build variable, setting it to the PLATFORMNAME i want, even without remembering the platform directory name.p  pThe problem is that the INCLUDEDIR variable is not expanded and i have lot of errors like invalid project path include path not found abcincludecTable. I think that the problem is the type of the build variables. INCLUDEDIR has Path type, but ive tested using both path and string types for the other without any success. I would like to ask if someone can point me to a good approach for the creation of these build variables. I dont use eclipse for compiling, but just for code editing, so what i want is to use the code completion and syntax highlighting.p

Negative 114 pWe have some algorithms optimized using Cuda that we would like to unit test in our automated build system running TeamCity.

In addition, I cant animate the navigation items associated with each level. In other words, when I click a link at the top level, I would expect the subnavigation items to animate in.

I dont want to load my app when it initially loads, instead, I want to defer loading of content until its needed.p  pCan anyone recommend a SPA framework to help me address this challenge I dont think I can tackle this problem with Angular 1.3. The router in Angular 2.0 look like a potential option. For now though, it does not look viable.p  pThanksp

I have a table named employees that lists there name and has a check box for different work assignments they are trained in, as well as what team they are assigned to.p  pI built a schedule form that when I select the team it only shows me the employees that are marked for that team.

Negative 114 pIm trying to figure out why codeemcode font sizing is not behaving the way it should when codebodycode font size is set to 10 pixels. in other words its like theres a 9px minimum font size applied to elements unless I overwrite it with a pixel value. Can anyone explain why is this happeningp  pFor more clarification Ive set codehtmlcodes codefontsizecode to code62.5code for accessibility, which on default settings on most browsers is equal to code10pxcode. I also set codebodycode font size to code1emcode which inherently is equal to code10pxcode. I have 3 paragraphs which have codeemcode font sizes. If you try to inspect the codepcode elements in chrome and go to the computed tab in dev tools, youll see that the first paragraph that has a codefontsizecode of code1emcode is computed to code10pxcode as expected. But the other two paragraphs codefontsizecode is computed to code9pxcode, which I expect them to be code8pxcode and code6pxcode. Its like theres code9pxcode minimum font size applied and the only way to overwrite it is to apply a codepxcode font size to it.p  pP.S Ive experienced this in Chrome Version 40.0.2214.111, this also happens in latest safari on OS X Yosemite.p  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodecss langcss prettyprintoverridecodehtml    fontsize62.5   padding3em  body  fontsize1em   .10    fontsize1em  .8    fontsize0.8em  .6    fontsize0.6em codepre pre classsnippetcodehtml langhtml prettyprintoverridecodeltp class10gt1x10  10ltpgt ltp class8gt0.8x10  9 ltpgt ltp class6gt0.6x10  9 ltpgtcodepre div div p

Negative 114 pWith missing background in informatics I have difficulties to understand the differences between codeaescode and codeaesstringcode in ggplot2 and its implications for daily usage.p  pFrom the description codeaesstringcode I was able to understand that both codedescribe how variables in the data are mapped to visual properties aesthetics of geomcode. p  pFurthermore it is said that codeaes uses nonstandard evaluation to capture the variable names.code whereas codeaesstringcode uses coderegular evaluationcode.p  pFrom example code it is clear that both produce the same output codea list of unevaluated expressionscodep  precodegt aesstringx  mpg, y  wt List of 2   x symbol mpg   y symbol wt gt aesx  mpg, y  wt List of 2   x symbol mpg   y symbol wt codepre  pcodeNonstandard evaluationcode is described by a hrefhttpadvr.had.co.nzComputingonthelanguage.html relnofollowHadley Wickham in his book emAdvanced Rema as a method to not only call the values of a functions argument but also the code that produced them. p  pI would assume that coderegular evaluationcode in opposition only calls the values from the function, but I did not find a source to confirm this assumption. Furthermore it is unclear to me how those two differ and why this should be relevant to me when I use the package. p  pOn the a hrefhttpwww.insider.orgpackagescranggplot2docsaesstring relnofollowinsideR websitea it is mentioned that codeaesstring is particularly useful when writing functions that create plots because you can use strings to define the aesthetic mappings, rather than having to mess around with expressions.codep  pBut in that sense it is unclear to me why I should ever use codeaescode and not opt always for codeaesstringcode whenever using codeggplot2code... In that sense it would help me to find some clarifications on those concepts and a practical hint for daily usage. p

Negative 114 pIm using the cocoapod a hrefhttpcocoapods.orgpodsSWRevealViewController relnofollowSWRevealViewControllera with a hrefhttpsgithub.comVandborgSWRevealViewControllerXamarinBinding relnofollowXamarin .net bindinga in my current Xamarin project. I made a new static library locally using XCode and added the SWRevealViewController pod to also build for arm64 architecture. I build the new library both for simulator i386 and x8664 and device armv7 and arm64, and used lipo to combine the two initial libraries into one universal library. Using file lib.a, I can see that the new universal library contains all four architectures. p  pWhen I replace the original library SWRevealViewControllerSDK.a with the new static library in the Xamarinproject, I get two issuesp  po For simulator I get a runtime errorp  precodeUnknown class SWRevealViewController in Interface Builder file. codepre  po For device I get a build time error p  precodeMTOUCHTASK error MT5211 Native linking failed, undefined ObjectiveC class OBJCCLASSSWRevealViewController.

Negative 114 pIve been trying to learn C lately, and Im working on making a linked list of intervals that have no intersection, but ive been getting some really weird errors. My integers obtained from getbi or getbs give some pretty ridiculous values after I run the reuinion function the second time. Since those values lead to some unintended behaviour, I get segmentation faults. I thought that was the root of the problem, but Im not sure how to fix them. I dont think Im accessing pointers that point to nothing or whatever is causing that.p  precodeinclude ltcstddefgt include ltiostreamgt  using namespace std  class Uinter            Regrouping class

Repeatedly create terms and add them to the result until all the numbers on the sequence are equal. Get it to print out the polynomial so you can see the result. Call  allEqual, nextTerm, and updateSequence to achieve this most likely. I have written the allEqual, nextTerm, updateSequencewith extreme amounts of help from the awesome community herep  pAlso, i need to make a constructor so i can split a string which has numbers seperated by commas so string might be 1,2,3,4,5 and seperate it so i have just numbers, convert them to double and then store in an array called sequence. I dont know at all this can be done. I think String.split and Double.parseDouble might be something i can use but i dont know how to use it.p  pPLease help.  I was wondering if someone can help me out with this method. i really have no idea where to start.p  h2Thanks guys,h2  pBasically, the solveSequence method is suppose to perform the following steps over and over again till we get a polynomial that can describe our sequence of numbers.p  pThe algorithm that i am trying to implement is iterative. Each iteration derives one term of the polynomial. For example, starting from the sequence of numbers [1, 1, 5, 13, 25]p  p1 Repeatedly calculate the differences between adjacent numbers in the sequence, until every number in the sequence is the same p  p[1, 1, 5, 13, 25]      [0, 4, 8, 12]      [4, 4, 4]p  p2 The exponent of the new term is the number of steps above, i.e. 2.p  pThe coefficient of the new term is the number on the final sequence divided by the factorial of the exponent, i.e. 42  2. Thus the new term is 2x2.p  p3 Subtract the new term from each element of the original sequence. From the first element subtract 2  12, from the second subtract 2  22, from the third subtract 2  32, etc. This leaves [1, 7, 13, 19, 25], which is the sequence of numbers to start the next iteration.p  pThe second iteration with this example yields the term 6x, and leaves the sequence [5, 5, 5, 5, 5]. Now all of the numbers in the sequence are the same, so the iteration terminates. The final term in the polynomial is the number on the final sequence, i.e. 5, and the complete polynomial is p  p2x2  6x  5 p  pSo solveSequence is supposed to use the methods allEqual, nextTerm, and updateSequence and then find out the whole polynomial and return it or print it. p  pPlease help. Kinda desperate now.p

Negative 114 pEvery week, my analysts have a spreadsheet of invoices which they need to update with a check number and check date. The checks table exists in SQL server. p  pIve written them a macro that iterates through each row of the spreadsheet, opens an ADO recordset using a statement like thisp  precodeSELECT CheckNumber, CheckDate FROM CHECKS WHERE InvoiceNumber   amp cells i,2 codepre  p... and then uses the fields from the recordset to write the number and date to the first two columns of that row in the Excel spreadsheet.p  pThe code performs acceptably for a few hundred rows, but is slow when there are thousands of rows.p  pIs there a faster way to update an Excel spreadsheet than with a rowbyrow lookup using ADO  For example, is there a way to do a SQL join between the spreadsheet and the table in SQL Server p  pEdit In response to Jeepeds questions, heres a bit of clarification.p  pWhat Im really trying to do is find a way to batch update an Excel spreadsheet with information from SQL server, instead executing SQL lookups and writing the results a row at a time. Is there a way to do the equivalent of a join and return the entire results set in a single recordset p  pThe Invoice example above really represents a class of problems that I encounter daily. The end users have a spreadsheet that contains their working data e.g. invoices and they want me to add information from a SQL server table to it.  For example, Using the invoice number in column C, add the check number for that invoice in column A, and the check date in column B.  Another example might be For each invoice in column b, add the purchase order number to column a.  p  pThe Excel source column would be either a number or text. The match column in the SQL table would be of a corresponding data type, either varchar or integer. The data is properly normalized, indexed, etc.  The updates would normally affect a few hundred or thousand rows, although sometimes there will be as many as twenty to thirty thousand. p  pIf I can find a way to batch rows, Ill probably turn this into an Excel addin to simplify the process.  For that reason, Id like to stay in VBA because my power users can extend or modify it to meet their needsId rather not write it in a .NET language because then we need to dedicate developer time to modifying and deploying it. The security of the Excel application is not a concern here because the users already have access to the data through ODBC linked tables in an MS Access database and we have taken appropriate security precautions on the SQL Server.  p  pMoving the process to SSIS would require a repeatability that doesnt exist in the actual business process.  p

Negative 114 pMy objective is to get relationships from database A to database B.
