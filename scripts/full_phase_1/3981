Positive 3981 pFor this program, I am trying to set up a payroll for inputted employees. The program has the user enter the employees name, tax ID, and wage, and automatically generates an ID number for each employee entered. After this information is inputted, the user is asked to give the number of hours worked for 2 weeks. To do this, the employee ID number is entered to give reference to the employee that worked a certain number of hours. Next, either week 1 or 2 is entered to determine which week they worked. Finally, the number of hours worked that week is entered. Once the information is finished, the user enters 0 to stop entering the data, and the payroll is printed in a chart. The main issue I am having is that you MUST enter the ID, week, and hours for EACH employee added to the list, regardless of whether or not they worked in the 2 week period. I want to try and figure out how to set the Hours Worked and Total pay numbers to 0 if I do not enter any information for a certain employee. For example, if I enter 1, for employee 1 1, for week 1 20, for hours worked in week 1 press enter 1, again for employee 1 2, for week 2 and 30, for hours worked in week 2, this information will print in the table. Say I have another employee, employee 2. I do not want to enter all of this information for employee 2 if they did not work at all in week 1 or 2, so the table should print 0 for Hours Worked, and 0 for Total Pay if I decide not to enter the ID, week number, and hours worked. Instead, however, it gives me an outOfBoundsException Index 1 Size 1 Error when I try to do this. I was wondering if anyone had a solution to this. The 3 classes of my code are posted below. An example of the executed program with the outOfBoundsException is given in the main class.p  precodeimport java.util.Scanner import java.util.ArrayList     A class that contains methods for prompting a user for ACME employee information including names, tax IDs, and wages.   public class EmployeeRecord       ArrayLists used in methods.

I am getting a codeRuntimeError maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object.code If I try to run it using Pyinstaller I get the error codeTypeError iteration over nonsequencecode which seems like it relates to the same thing that is wrong using py2exe. Im not sure where it is coming from.p  pI have gone through the steps creating a setup.py filep  precodefrom distutils.core import setup import py2exe setupconsole[MyFileName.py] codepre  pThen running codepython setup.py py2exe helpcode from the command window, then codepython setup.py py2execodep  pI understand that the RunTimeError happens when the code encounters infinite recursions, but my .py file does not have this error.

I had this all working, or so I thought, until I noticed that the special tags in the headers and footers werent being replaced.  So, I turned to this artical a hrefhttpword.mvps.orgfaqscustomizationReplaceAnywhere.htm relnofollowhttpword.mvps.orgfaqscustomizationReplaceAnywhere.htma and found that working with a range of ranges or cycling through all available Story Ranges in the document I was able to do this.  So, I improved my code, just like it was recommended in the link above and it worked, so long as my code was embedded in my Normal word file, thereby using my VBA code from Word to operate on another Word document.  However, the goal is to use VBA Excel to operate the replacements while reading an Excel file.  When I moved the code to Excel, it seems as if it isnt quite working and Im getting hung up on an Automation error which reads, Runtime error 2147319779 8002801d Automation error  Library not registered..  Ive looked and looked for answers from reviewing the Registry to using Word.Application.12 in place of Word.Application, but to no avail.p  pI currently have a Windows 7, 64Bit machine, with Microsoft Office 2007.

Anyone known why this is  For Each StoryRange In WordObj.Documentsa.StoryRanges      Do         All you need to know about the following function call is that I have a function that works to replace strings.  It works fine provided it has valid strings and a valid StoryRange.

Please throw anything at me  I dont mind learning from my mistakes, but finding an answer to the core problem is a must for me.  All I ask is that your comments remain construtive.  With me, you cant provide too much detail toward what you are thinking.  I am just looking for someone to help me gain a more thorough understanding into my problem.p  pThank you for your timep

Negative 3981 pDoes anybody have a known reliable way to create a video from a series of image files  Before you mod me down for not searching for the answer before posting the question, and before you fire off a simple message like use FFMPEG, read the rest of this message.p  pIm trying to create a video, it doesnt matter too much what format as long as its widely supported, from a series of images .jpg, .bmp, etc..  My platform is Windows Server 2008, 64bit.  If I can make the video from within my C program, thats great, but Im not averse to writing a series of image files to a directory and then firing off an external program to make a video from those images.p  pThe only constraints are it must work on my Windows Server 2008 system, and be scriptable.  That is, no GUI programs that require operator intervention.p  pI found a number of similar questions on StackOverflow, and have tried several of the solutions, all with varying degrees of frustration and none with anything like success.p  pFFMPEG looks like a great program.  Maybe it is, on Linux.  The two Windows builds I downloaded are broken.  Given this command linep  precode  ffmpeg r 1 f image2 i jpeg.jpg video.avi codepre  pOne of the builds reads the images and then crashes due to data execution prevention.  The other reads the first file and then spits out an error message that says cannot find suitable codec for file jpegimage2.jpg.  Helpful, that.  In any case, FFMPEG looks like a nonstarter under Windows.p  pOne answer to a previous posting recommended a hrefhttpwww.codeplex.comsplicerSplicera .  It looks like pretty good code.  I compiled the samples and tried to run, but got some cryptic error message about a file not found.  It looks like a COM class isnt registered.  I suppose I need to install something DirectShow, maybe, although I thought that was already installed.  Depending on whats required, I might have a difficult time justifying its installation on a server.  What  Why do you need that on a serverp  pAnother answer suggested the a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comKBaudiovideoavifilewrapper.aspxAviFilea library from Code Project.  That looks simple enough  a wrapper around the Windows AviFile subsystem.  Except that the AVI files the package creates appear to have all of the frames, but only the first frame shows when I play the AVI in Windows Media Player.  Well, that and if you try to create a compressed video, the program throws an exception.p  pSo, Im left wondering if there is a good, reliable way to do what I want on a Windows system, create an AVI or other common video file format from a series of images, either through a .NET API or using an external program.

Negative 3981 pFolks, p  pFor the nth time in a row, im hitting the same old problem again. Its about how do I map OOP structures to database tables in a painless way.p  pHeres a scenario I have several types of actors in my system  workers, employers, contacts. They have certain pieces of functionality in common other pieces are vastly different. The entities that all actors deal with are communications, notes admins like to leave notes on customers, and a few more. There are tons of types of other entities that each actor type deals with, while the others dont. p  pCurrently, my database schema includes tables forp  pActorsp  ul liworkerli liemployerli licontactli ul  pEntitiesp  ul licommunicationli linotesli lietc.li ul  pAssociation tables between entities and actorsp  ul liworkercommunicationassnli liemployercommunicationassnli liworkernotesassnli lietc, you get the drill. li ul  pThis feels like a code smell to me. Whenever a customer changes their role i.e. promoted from contact to employer, a bunch of crazy scripts need to be run. Yuck... On the other hand, if i was operating in a purely OOPdriven world, this would be much easier  have a base class for all entities with common properties, and be done with it...p  pIn the DB world, that option seems theoretically possible, but sounds very messy... I.e. if I understand this right, Id have a new baseactor table, and each other actor would have a baseactorid, and then the associations would be between baseactor and the entities... But then, how do I do reverseassociation queries I.e. show me all communications with just actors of type workerp  pAny advice Any general thoughts on the subject of mapping OOP structures to relational DB p

Negative 3981 pI am currently developing a WPF application for a Single Board AMD Geode Computer touch screen.p  pWindows Embedded Standard installs fine on the device and it has .Net 3.5 loaded. The application runs fine for the most part but I am getting some anomalous behavior and I am suspecting it coming from the framework, as the problems cannot be reproduced on my development machine.p  pA short description of the problemp  pI have this on screen keyboard. As you touch the buttons it displays what you are typing inside this text box at the top of the on screen keyboard. The user key presses are handled by a mouse down event handler on the buttons. Pretty simple. Inside this handler Ip  ol liPlay a sound for the key press.li liDo some shift and caps logicli liDetermine what key was pressed via senderli liUpdate the keyboard textli ol  pNow, this works pretty obviously on my development machine. No problems. On Windows Embedded standard I get this weird lag on my keyboard. Basically I press a key, the sound plays but the key that you pressed is not updated in the text box at the top of the keyboard. It only updates much much later, randomly.  Either seconds later or 30 seconds later, its pretty random and keeps track of all the keys I pressed p  pNow, I have placed a log entry at the bottom of my mouse down handler, and have established that my handler does complete. The text is simply not updated. Also, I can keep on hitting buttons and the sounds play as I hit them, but the text is not update for long times, then suddenly all at once. p  pThe other weird thing is this behavior is not always present. It seems that the longer the OS is up, the more likely it becomes that the keyboard will lag. No other programs are running on the device. Usually after a fresh restart the lag is not there for about 520 mins. I have checked the CPU, its pretty much idle through the lag spikes. Application restarts does not solve the initial lag hypothesis. The OS must be restarted to get rid of the problemp  pNow, I have tried almost everything I can think of but I think this place is my last hope.p  pPlease help me.p  pRegards,p

Negative 3981 pI am trying to get some C code originally written in Microsoft Visual Studio VS 2003 to compile under VS 2008 and I am having trouble finding an efficient solution to assigning a vectoriterator to the beginning of a char array.  I know that iterators went from being a defined as a simple pointer type T to a class type between VS 2003 and VS 2005.  Here is a simple example of what I am talking aboutp  precodetypedef stdvectorltchargt       CharContainer typedef CharContaineriterator InputIt  int FindNumMsgs InputIt inputIter, int len   int ProcessBufferForMsgs char buf[], const sizet maxlen       int numMsgs  FindNumMsgs InputItbuf, maxlen      ...  codepre  pSo, in VS 2003, this compiles and works with no problem since iterators are defined as T.  In VS 2008, this errors with C2440 functionstylecast since I can no longer just assign the iterator with the buf pointer.  What would I do to get this to work in VS 2008 now that iterators are a class type  I could copy the buffer into a vector, then pass in myVec.begin, but I have to think that I can avoid this overhead.p

Negative 3981 pIm having a problem and hope, someone knows whats going wrong and why and is able to give me the explanation of what Im missing out right now to make that thing work as suggested.p  pI have a JTree which is build upon a custom TreeModel WRTreeModel, see below. The data structure this model shall be used for is build of an root object which contains some fields and furthermore a list which is backed by the ArrayListModel shown below. The tree looks fine when I build it using the WRTreeModel. Im able to expand and collapse the nodes which represent the lists and fields contained in the objects. I can expand and collapse these lists and see their contents as well and so on.p  pNow I want to remove a child of one of the lists and  as I already know  do it by removing it from the model calling the remove method of the ArrayListModel. To make the WRTreeModel aware of that remove, the first thing is to call its fireIntervalRemoved method is called, so far so good.p  pIn the WRTreeModels inner class ArrayModelListener the intervalRemoved method prepares the call of fireTreeNodesRemoved which then builds a TreeEvent which is forwarded to all registered TreeModelListeners and therefore the JTree which registers itself automaticall when its connected to the model.p  pNow I would expect that the tree reflects the change and updates its internal and visual representation to show the new state. Unfortunately this doesnt seem to work that way. Something happens. But when I click on the node I just have changed some EventHandlerExceptions are thrown. Obviously something got really confused.p  pI know its not easy to answer such a question on the fly but I would really appreciate a fast answer.

Negative 3981 pI have a list of about 60 stores with physical addresses and geocodes.  I would like to make a simple interface where a user can enter a zip code, or city and state, or even a street address and have the list sort in order of proximity to the entered address.  This is a very common feature of websites as I understand.p  pMy plan to do this is to use the Google Maps API to find the geocode of the entered location and use the Pythagorean Theorem to calculate the distance from each location and sort the list by the distances and return the result or maybe the top 5 of the result set....p  pIs this the correct way to do this  Is there a more optimal method or a function builtin the Google Maps API that will do this  Since this is something so common, I would imagine there has been tried and tested in many ways and there are probably several correct answers.  I am just looking for some advice if I am going about this the correct way.p  pThank you.p

Negative 3981 pWe usually blacklist IPs address with codeiptablescode. But in Amazon EC2, if a connection goes through the Elastic Load Balancer, the remote address will be replaced by the load balancers address, rendering codeiptablescode useless.

Negative 3981 pMy code, used to work, but I recently updated jqueryui to 1.8 and jquery to 1.4 because emsomeem things werent working. Once I did that, those things started working, however, now I notice this one dialog is positioning itself topcenter, instead of middlecenter.p  pLet me explain the code a bit first. The code queries an AJAX request every x minutes to see the last time the session was hit. If its been 10 minutes since they last hit their session, a jquery ui dialog div appears, with a warning that their session is about to expire, and there is a button that lets you rehit your session via a separate inline AJAX GET request without reloading the whole page.p  pHeres the actual trouble. After 15 minutes or more, its supposed to close the warning dialog it checks if its already open, which in this situation it likely is and then creates a new dialog with an inline login form that lets you re validate your login without reloading the page and losing any unsaved, halfway filled out formsp  pHere is the function that is supposed to close the warning, create the relogin divp  precodefunction renderReLogin  if logOutWarning.dialogisOpen       logOutWarning.dialogclose close warning dialog as session has already expired   if logOutReLogin.dialogisOpen  true      noticeContainers.htmlltdiv idlogOutReLogin titleYouve been logged outgtltdiv idlogOutReLoginTextgtltdivgtltdivgt   logOutReLoginText.htmlThis session has expired.

But the relogin dialog snaps to the very topcenter of the viewport, rather than the middlecenter.p  pWhen I manually call logOutReLogin.dialogoption, position, center  via firebug in FireFox after its already opened, it does go to where it should be. It just seems to be the open behavior within the function above.p  pI appreciate any helpp

Negative 3981 pIm building a large Lucene index and each document I insert requires a little bit of putting together before it can be inserted.

The FSM will call a states Execute function. At the end of the function, the state will post an event, and the FSM will determine which state to go to next. In state A, it will call rand.

Negative 3981 pSo the title is somewhat misleading... Ill keep this simple Im comparing these two data structuresp  ol liAn array, whereby it starts at size 1, and for each subsequent addition, there is a realloc call to expand the memory, and then append the new malloced element to the n1 position.li liA linked list, whereby I keep track of the head, tail, and size. And addition involves mallocing for a new element and updating the tail pointer and size.li ol  pDont worry about any of the other details of these data structures. This is the only functionality Im concerned with for this testing.p  pIn theory, the LL should be performing better. However, theyre near identical in time tests involving 10, 100, 1000... up to 5,000,000 elements.p  pMy gut feeling is that the heap is large. I think the data segment defaults to 10 MB on Redhat I could be wrong. Anyway, realloc is first checking to see if space is available at the end of the alreadyallocated contiguous memory location 0[n1]. If the nth position is available, there is not a relocation of the elements. Instead, realloc just reserves the old space  the immediately following space. Im having a hard time finding evidence of this, and Im having a harder time proving that this array should, in practice, perform worse than the LL.p  pHere is some further analysis, after reading posts belowp  p[Update 1] Ive modified the code to have a separate list that mallocs memory every 50th iteration for both the LL and the Array. For 1 million additions to the array, there are almost consistently 18 moves. Theres no concept of moving for the LL. Ive done a time comparison, theyre still nearly identical. Heres some output for 10 million additionsp  precodeArray time .a.out a 10,000,000 real    0m31.266s user    0m4.482s sys     0m1.493s LL time .a.out l 10,000,000 real    0m31.057s user    0m4.696s sys     0m1.297s codepre  pI would expect the times to be drastically different with 18 moves. The array addition is requiring 1 more assignment and 1 more comparison to get and check the return value of realloc to ensure a move occurred.p  pstrong[Update 2] I ran an ltrace on the testing that I posted above, and I think this is an interesting result... It looks like realloc or some memory manager is preemptively moving the array to larger contiguous locations based on the current size.  For 500 iterations, a memory move was triggered on iterations 1, 2, 4, 7, 11, 18, 28, 43, 66, 101, 154, 235, 358 Which is pretty close to a summation sequence. I find this to be pretty interesting  thought Id post it.strongp

Negative 3981 pIm trying to code a progress bar in JS.p  pI have the bar coded but have problems with the math to get it to work correctly. When a user clicks on the bar Im grabbing the pixel position they click on...this is working correctly. So my bar is 80px wide and if i click in the middle the clicked value returns at about 40...if i click right at the end of the bar i get back 80. p  pSo I thought I needed to divide the click position by the total width of the bar and then times this by the total volume...which is 100...p  pso clicking in the middle of the bar  40  80  0.5. This is correct...the user has clicked halfway so 0.5 makes sense....but then if I times this by 100 it gives me 50 obviously...which isnt right...if i do the scenario where a user has clicked for full volume i get 80  80  1  100  100p  pWhat calculation do i need to make to get this working p

Negative 3981 pIve implemented an EJB3  JPA web service without any major problems, and now Ive moved on a SpringWSJPA web service. Both are being deployed to Glassfish.p  pMy understanding of JPA is limited, but by default transactions are container managed How do you change this With EJB3 things were straight forward as I could just inject the codeEntityManagercode in to the DAO a discussion for another time with codePersistentContextcode and the container would take care of transaction demarcation. In terms of basic configuration thats about it. As the container uses JTA then Ive specified the transaction type JTA on the persistence unit. In my very simple example application with one persistence unit I do not have to care about its name  Do things get more complicated if you have multiple persistence units or will the container take care of thisp  pNow Ive built an equivelent web service with SpringWS and have reused my entitiesdaos, but Ive struggled to get it working.

The issue were having is that when clicking on this audio link in a Windows 7 system with an IE8 browser, the user gets an Enter Network Password prompt. They will get this prompt every time they click on it, regardless of whether they enter their credentials or not. This issue was just noticed a few weeks ago, though they were able to access these links without a prompt before, from the Windows 7 system. We originally thought it was a code change, but after stripping the page to what you see above and still having the issue it shows that its independent of our code and was probably introduced by a recent Windows 7 update. p  pWhen these users log in from an XP system theyre able to listen to the audio and do NOT get the prompt. Also, if the user has QuickTime as their default audio player then the above link works fine in Windows 7, without prompts, so it seems that its the Windows 7 and Windows Media Player combination that is causing this Enter Network Password prompt. Another part of this puzzle is that if the user is an admin on the server where the web app is, then they do NOT get the prompt. Obviously we cant make all the users Admins on the server to resolve this p  pI hope Ive included enough information. Has anybody run into anything like this Anybody have any idea how we can get around this Thanks in advance. Ben.p

Negative 3981 pWe have a system that uses SQL Server 2008 in tandem with MongoDB, using the latter for a lot of adhoc reporting features.  They dont intersect emmuchem, but there are one or two places where they do actually need to work together.p  pI was always slightly concerned about the transactional implications but figured it was not really a big problem if the application did the Mongo work first, and it technically emisntem that big of a problem if a transaction fails in the middle once in a while.

What would be ideal rather then targeting categories would be if there were a tag to simply look for if a single.php page amp subpage of a parent in the menu was in use...couldnt really find anything that worked however so Im hoping some phpwordpress guru can point in the right direction hopefully p  pHere is my current markupbr strongHTML MENUstrong   p  precodeltul idnavgt     ltligt         lta href idlogogtltagt     ltligt     ltligt         lta href idhome ltphp if  isfrontpageevents  echo  classhomehighlight   gtgtltagtlt HOME gt     ltligt     ltligt         lta hrefartists idartists ltphp if  ispageartists  echo  classartistshighlight   gtgtltagtlt ARTISTS gt     ltligt     ltligt         lta hrefmedia idmedia ltphp if  ispagemedia  echo  classmediahighlight   gtgtltagtlt MEDIA gt     ltligt     ltligt         lta hrefblog idblog ltphp if  ishomeblog  echo  classbloghighlight   gtgtltagtlt BLOG gt     ltligt     ltligt         lta hrefstore idstore ltphp if  ispagestore  echo  classstorehighlight   gtgtltagtlt STORE gt     ltligt     ltligt         lta hrefcontact idcontact ltphp if  ispagecontact  echo  classcontacthighlight   gtgtltagtlt CONTACT gt     ltligt ltulgt codepre

Any pointers or comments would be appreciated. Note that I dont want a custom progress bar, but just a structure so that I can poll progress with javascript during loading.p  pCheers.p  pEdit amol I will bring to your attention that JNLP deployed applets and application, during their loading, call a generic DownloadServiceListener classs method progressjava.net.URL url, java.lang.String version, long readSoFar, long total, int overallPercent whenever one of the jars required is downloaded. Knowing the total numbers of jars and the number of jars yet to be downloaded will serve as a perfect progress indicatior. I want also to bring to your attention that if you debug the JNLP deployment, you will see these methods being called and logging as network level events. So, my question is how to get a hang of these methods using javascript so i can have some estimate about progress as I dont want the user to look at java console to estimate progress. I dont want to also show an indeterminate progress loader, as it is a breeze to implement that, but no practical use whatsoever.p

Negative 3981 pHow can I append files to an existing zip file  I already have the code that can create a zip file and it works great except for one big problem.  The way it works now, the user takes a bunch of pictures, and at the end, all the pictures get added to a zip file, which can take quite a while if you take enough pictures.    So Im thinking, I have a very good and efficient solution.  As the pictures are taken, I will simply add the each new picture to the zip file right after its taken.  Then when theyre done taking pictures, finish up the zip file so its usable and export it.  p  pThe problem is, I can not get it to add files to an existing zip file.   Heres what I have so far.  Also, please keep in mind, this is just a proof of concept, I do understand that reinitializing everything for every iteration of the for loop is very dumb.  Each iteration of the loop is supposed to represent another file being added which will most likely be a long time later, maybe even an hour later, which is why I have everything resetting each iteration, because the app will be shut down between adding files.  If I can get this working, then I will actually ditch the for loop and put this code into a function that gets called every time a picture gets taken. p  precode        try               forint i0 i lt files.size i                  beginning of initial setup stuff                 BufferedInputStream origin  null                 FileOutputStream dest  new FileOutputStreamzipFile,false                  ZipOutputStream out  new ZipOutputStreamnew BufferedOutputStreamdest                 byte data[]  new byte[BUFFER]                 out.setLevel0 I added this because it makes it not compress the data                  at all and I hoped that it would allow the zip to be appended to                 end of initial setup stuff                  beginning of old for loop                 Log.vCompress, Adding   files[i]                  FileInputStream fi  new FileInputStreamfiles[i]                  origin  new BufferedInputStreamfi, BUFFER                  ZipEntry entry  new ZipEntryfiles[i].substringfiles[i].lastIndexOf  1                  out.putNextEntryentry                  int count                  while count  origin.readdata, 0, BUFFER  1                       out.writedata, 0, count                                    origin.close                      end of for old loop                  beginning of finishing stuff                 out.close                 end of finishing stuff                        catchException e              Log.eZipCreation, Error writing zip, e             e.printStackTrace          codepre  pAlso, I have experimented around with p  precodeFileOutputStream dest  new FileOutputStreamzipFile,true codepre  pIf you notice, I set append to true, which will actually append the data to an existing file.  And whats interesting is, it actually does append the data to the original file, however, after the file gets extracted on my computer, the last file written is all that gets extracted, which is bad.    So is there some way to start writing a zip file, and then later, add on to it, and finish up the zip file  Ive even thought about possibly taking ZipOutputStream and modifying it to fit this model that I need.  It should logically be possible somehow p  pThanks in advance for the help Dp  pJaredp

Negative 3981 pIm working on a trivia like app and wondering how is the best way to store all of the questions and answers. Right now, I just have a random number and using a whole lot of if statements. For example, if randomNum  25, then question is THIS and choices are THIS. This seems to work fine, but my file is starting to get very large and this seems like it should cause performance issues. Space is also starting to become an issue. I have started to look into just putting all of the data into database and use a random number to just retrieve a row. Anybody have any suggestions on which would be the best practice or have any other ways of doing thisp

Negative 3981 pIm writing a class which is used to work against a codebyte[]code buffer. It contains methods like codechar Peekcode and codestring ReadRestOfLinecode.p  pThe problem is that I would like to add support for unicode and I dont really know how I should change those methods they only support ASCII now.p  pHow do I detect that the next bytes in the buffer is a unicode sequence utf8 or utf16 And how do I convert them to a codecharcodep  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pYes, the class is a bit similar to the codeStreamReadercode, but with the difference that it will avoid creating objects like codestringcode, codechar[]code etc until the entire wanted string has been found. Its used in a high performance socket framework. p  pFor instance Lets say that I want write a proxy that will only check the URI in a HTTP request. If I where to use the codeStreamReadercode I would have to build a temp char array each time a new receive have been completed just to see if a new line character have been received. p  pBy using a class that works directly against the codebyte[]code buffer that codesocket.ReceiveAsynccode uses, I just have to traverse the buffer in my parser to know if the next step can be completed. No temporary objects are created.p  pFor most protocols ASCII is used in the header area and UTF8 will not be a problem the request body can be parsed using codeStreamReadercode. Im just interested in how it can be solved avoiding to create unnecessary objects.p

Negative 3981 pApparently you can create services that are run with Twisteds twistd in two different ways. On the one hand you can create services using the a hrefhttptwistedmatrix.comdocumentscurrentcorehowtoapplication.htmlTwisted Application Infrastructurea and in the other you can create a service using the a hrefhttptwistedmatrix.comdocumentscurrentcorehowtoplugin.htmlTwisted Plugin Systema.

Negative 3981 blockquote   pThe capacity of a Queue is the number of elements the Queue can hold. As elements are added to a Queue, the capacity is automatically increased as required through reallocation. The capacity can be decreased by calling TrimToSize.p blockquote  pThis is written in a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.collections.queue.aspxMSDN Queue Documentap  pNow the question is that in a queue if we add around 20 thousand items then one by one that queue is Dequeued until the queue is empty. If we dont call TrimToSize function then the queue size will remain to that 20 Thousand but the data is removed by the garbage collector so technically there is no memory leak and if we check the count or serialize the queue the size is of an empty queue. strongSo why should we call TrimToSize function strongp

Negative 3981 pI have worked with a custom php framework and django templates in the past, both of which support what I can describe as base templates.

Would this be good practice or should a domain POCO be limited to simple properties I am concerned that this is really part of the validation and that by placing the method in the POCO I am seperating the validation between Service and POCO.p  pWhat I am trying to ensure is that my application is easy to maintain and test. Any suggestions on how I should tackle this would be most appreciatedp

Negative 3981 pIm using the simple objectgraph mapping in Spring Data Neo4j 2.0, where I perform persistence operations using the Spring Data repository framework. Im working with the repositories rather than working with the Neo4jTemplate. I inject the repositories into my Spring Web MVC controllers, and the controllers call the repos directly. No intermediate service layermy operations are generally CRUDs and finder queries.p  pWhen I do read operations, there are no issues. But when I do write operations, I get NotInTransactionException. My understanding is that read ops in Neo4j dont require transactions, but write ops do.p  pWhats the best way to get transactions into the picture here, assuming I want to stick with the simple OGM Im wanting to use Transactional, but putting that on the various repository interfaces doesnt work. If I introduce an intermediate service tier in between the controllers and the repositories and then annotate the service beans with Transactional, then it works, but Im wondering whether theres a simpler way to do it. Without Spring Data, Id typically have access to the DAO repository implementations, so Id be able to annotate the concrete DAOs with Transactional if I wanted to avoid a passthrough service tier. With Spring Data the repos are dynamically generated so that doesnt appear to be an option.p

Negative 3981 pIm trying to stream data using TCP from a client to a server. My client application is generating data every tick. The data is buffered for transfer, and every 500ms the whole buffer is sent to the server.  So far, so good. The data Im getting from the client is valid, and the throughput is high, around 30KBs. After about a minute, though, the throughput quickly drops to zero. If I wait for awhile, sometimes the throughput increases again, but eventually drops back to zero. p  pIm generating data every tick, so if the receiving end slows down, theres more data to receive than usual, which takes longer to receive, and so on.p  pThe maximum send buffer I can use on the client a phone device is 217 bytes, and RTT time is around 50ms.

Negative 3981 pI have this Problem and solving it is not the problem, more like what is the fastest way doing it. So i am asking the more experienced of you to help me find a fast solution.p  pI have People, each defined as a Integer between 1000 and 3000. Every of these people can be assigned to someone else, this would look like ltInteger for p1, Integer for p2 There are some rules for these connections, there will be not more than 10000, but at least one of them  and each pair of people can only occur once, so lt1000,2000 and lt2000,1000 are not allowed At the Moment i store all of these connections in a LinkedList where Connection is a Class containing the two Integers of the two people.p  pI then need to find the person occuring the most times in all connections, if there are more than one, i would need to have all of them unsorted.p  pAfter that, i will iterate through the LinkedList and delete all connections where these people participated and redo the process until the list is empty.p  pSome problems i encountered are Concurred Access or use of the wrong MapsLists and a slow method of sorting.p  pI have no code at the moment, since i saw the performance of my old one and started from scratch with now nothing other than processing the input witch is already optimized p  pWhat would help me most is someone looking at my case and telling me his experiences of how fast different solutions with different Datatypes are. I want to write the code mostly myself, i just need some hints how to do it right.p  pThanks for the attention and hopefully for an answer. If something is unclear, i appologise for that and will clarify it upon asking p
Negative 3981 pDisclaimer  Im not the database designer. Im just the poor developer what has to make this work.p  pThere are 17 at the moment tables with identical structure  name, address, phone number.p  pGiven a phone number, I have to check to see if theres a matching entry in any of the tables, then return that address.p  pSo, I created a view to get the list of tables theres a ref table that holds that info, then I created a stored procedure to p  ol licreate a temp table, li liusing cursors, check each table in the view for the phone number, using sql concatenation. If a record is found, insert it into the temp table. li lireturn the rows from the temp table. li ol  pThis all works in straight TSQL. p  pNow, Im trying to use Entity Framework 4 to call the stored procedure. But the function import interface wont generate columns. It says return type  none, and the LINQ code expects an int and wont compile. p  pAny ideas on how to make this work p  pI know I can move the check tables part to code, if I absolutely have to, but Id rather have the above method work. p

I could use a file producer to copy the files from some remote directory to a local directory and then use the route. My route would be something like this thenp  precodeltroutegt             ltfrom urifilecCTestInboxnooptrueampamprecursivetrueampampdelay3000gt             ltto urifilecoutboxgt             ltto uribeanfileToSQLgt             ltto urijdbctimlogdbgt  ltroutegt codepre  pHowever since I have access to the files content in the message from the files consumer I should be able to theoretically be able to access the bodycontent of the string and build a SQL command that does NOT use the LOADFILE function. p  pThe only way I know how to build such a string is by using the prepared statement of JDBC. This would be first prize if I could somehow build a insert statement with the content from the file consumer. p  pCan I create a prepared statement in my fileToSQL bean and pass it to my jdbc component  Or how do I build a INSERT statement without the LOADFILE functionp  pSince I have to use the LOADFILE function I would now have to cater for both unix and windows filepaths. While this should not be difficult I just dont like the idea of putting OS specific code into my applicationsfeels like a work around. p  pAnybody here ever uploaded binary files to a MySQL database using Camel who can give me some guidance on the points above. While I could work around the problems I just want to make sure I dont miss a obvious way of doing things.p  pI had a look around here and only found people working with mostly text files. Guys please dont even go down the route of me storing the file on the files system and linking it to the database. We have some very specific disaster recovery requirements and legal requirements that enforce the need for me to store it in a database.p

Negative 3981 pIm working on a clientserver application .NET 4, WCF that must support backwards compatibility. In other words, old clients should be compatible with new servers and vice versa. As a result, our client code is littered with statements such asp  precodeif serverVersion gt new Version2, 1, 3      showhide something or call method Foo...  else     showhide something or call method Foo2...  codepre  pObviously, this becomes somewhat of a maintenance nightmare. Luckily, were allowed to break backwards compatibility with every minor release. When we get to a point where compatibility can be broken, Id like to clean up the code thats in the form of the example above.p  pMy questionsp  p1 Is there a way to easily identify code blocks such as these when they are no longer valid My initial thoughts were to somehow conditionally apply an Obsolete attribute based on the assemblys version. When we get to a new minor version, the Obsolete attribute would kickin, and all of a sudden we would have several compiler warnings pointing to these code blocks... Has anyone done anything like this Or is there a better way to manage thisp  p2 I cringe every time I see hardcoded versions such as codenew Version2, 1, 3code. What makes things worse is that during development, we dont know the final Version thats being released, so the version checks are based on the current build number  1 when the developer adds the check. Although this works, its not very clean. Any ideas on how this could be improvedp  pThanksp

Negative 3981 pfirst question from newbie. Havent needed to post a question for months now  so many great answers already posted. I am stuck on this one, though.p  pDeveloping on a Mac, Python 2.7, Django with the djangononrel project, GAE datastore. Up to and including GAE SDK 1.6.3, all goodness. After upgrading to GAE SDK 1.6.4, noticed 3 strange thingsp  ol lipDev server python manage.py runserver fails immediately with Error No module named webob. No other errors or output. I rooted around under usrlocalgoogleappenginelib... and, indeed, no module named webob. There are two close matches  webob09 and webob111. I made a symlink webob  webob111 to get past the error.pli lipStartup messages from the dev server include an INFO message that the SDK version is later than the advertised version. Google has 1.6.4 on their download site, so not seeing how my 1.6.4 is later than the latest.pli lipDjangos syncdb command python manage.py syncdb will no longer create the .gaedatadatastore file. It says its creating tables, it prompts me for the superuser creds, it even says it installed a bunch of objects from my fixture file. It gives no errors, but when it completes, it has done none of these things  the .gaedatadatastore file doesnt even exist.pli ol  pPrior to 1.6.4, syncdb worked great, including loading fixture data. I tried starting a fresh project with only bare bones files in it and a simple model one class having one field to see if some complexity I had introduced might be the cause of the problem. Even in simpleland, syncdb wouldnt create the datastore.p  pMy only solution was to fall back to GAE SDK 1.6.3  everything works once again. Anyone else seeing similar symptoms with SDK 1.6.4 Are there obvious diagnostic steps I should be takingp

Negative 3981 pContext Many of the operations Im doing require lengthy web accesses.  Sometimes a web access fails and the process needs to be restarted.  And its a pain to restart the process from scratch.p  pSo Ive written a number of adhoc approaches to checkpointing when you restart the process, it looks to see if checkpoint data is available and reinitializes state from that, otherwise it creates fresh state.  In the course of operation, the process periodically writes checkpoint data somewhere to a file or to the db.  And when its finished, it cleans up the checkpoint data.p  pId like a simple, DRY, generalpurpose checkpointing mechanism.  How would you write it  Or is there a module that already does this  Though its not an issue yet, extra stars awarded for threadsafe implementationsp

Negative 3981 pIm currently brainstorming a financial program that will deal with over time fairly large amounts of data. It will be a cQt gui app.p  pI figure reading all the data into memory at runtime is out of the question because given enough data, it might hog too much memory. p  pIm trying to come up with a way to read into memory only what I need, for example, if I have an account displayed, only the data that is actually being displayed and anything else that is absolutely necessary. That way the memory footprint could remain small even if the data file is 4gb or so.p  pI thought about some sort of searching function that would slowly read the file line by line and find a tag or something identifying the specific data I want, and then load that, but considering this could theoretically happen every time theres a gui update that seems like a terrible way to go.p  pEsentially I want to be able to efficiently locate specific data in a file, read only that into memory, and possibly change it and write it back without reading and writing the whole file everytime. Im not an experienced programmer and my googling for ideas hasnt been very successful.p  pThanks in advance for any ideasp  pEdit I should probably mention I intend to use Qts fancy QDataStream related classes to store the data. In other words the file will likely be binary and not easily searchable line by line like a text file.p

The reason this doesnt happen before the first two clicks is that the first undo tries to remove the most recent point, whereas the second undo simply pops the polygon off the objects stack. My question is why the codePointcode that codeactions.undocode tries to remove the same point twice, even though the first point should have been popped off the codeself.undoscode stack and pushed onto the codeself.redoscode stack Thanks very much for any feedback.p

Negative 3981 pI have a mobile app that accesses a server running a Rails 3.x app. The data is exchanged in JSON format.p  pI have a rather complicated issue, that I going to try and simplify here.p  pIn one scenario, the mobile app posts a new strongsalestrong record to the database which includes an update to an existing strongorderstrong record.  To achieve this as a single HTTP request, it passes the strongorderstrong record attributes update as part of the new strongsalestrong record via nested attributes.p  pThe Rails model for Sales includes the followingp  precodeattraccessible productid, orderid, orderattributes acceptsnestedattributesfor order, updateonly gt true codepre  pThe Rails routings are standard.p  pAs the http request to post the strongsalestrong will create a new record i.e. it does not include an existing saleid, I use HTTP POST.p  pI can post a new strongsalestrong record without the strongorderstrong record update just fine.p  pHowever, when I include the nested attributes to update the strongorderstrong record, I get 404 not found.p  pI emsuspectem that this is because the nested update of the existing strongorderstrong includes an id and therefore should actually be a PUT to route correctly.p  pTo help diagnose the issue, Ive tried changing existing working nonnested POSTs of strongsalesstrong that dont include an id to be PUT requests, and in that case, it does break the functionality, and I do get a 404.  This suggests to me that the server would indeed report PUTPOST confusion as a 404.p  pTo be clear I can successfully post updates using nested attributes in other circumstances using the same code, so Im confident that its not the actual attribute encoding that is the problem.p  pId appreciate thoughts on whether this could be the issue, and if so what I can do about it.p  pThank you.p

Negative 3981 pWe are departing from our typical native application development and are developing some new webbased application services.  We are using .Net and WCF and most likely hosting on IIS.p  pOur services will need to use a database to persist data.  In all cases we intend to make the database server a different box than our host.  Most of the resources we find seem to indicate storing the database connection string in the web.config or app.config file for selfhosting. Our concern is that since the service is webfacing the box it is running on is a more likely to be hackedcompromised.  If that happens, the attacker now had the DB connection string and will have full access to all of the data.p  pAn initial thought was to make the WCF service simply proxy to a server application that lives on another machine that holds the connection information and does all the processing logic. That way, if the the webhost is compromised they would have to figure out how to communicate with our server application, or compromise that machine as well, to gain database access.  Though we do have concerns of the performance costs of proxying and possibly having a bottleneck at the server application.p  pThe concern with that approach is that we are not finding much in the way of WCFIIS literature that recommending on such an approach, but we might just not know what it is called in order to find such information.  The question is proxying like that a good practice and whywhy not or where might I find more information on this topic, or is there a better practicep

With striping, the database is spawned across multiple segments   where each segment can have multiple stripes.    Format of the lines below     Segmentltnumbergt  ltsizegt, ltstripe file namegt [, ltstripe file namegt .. ]    ltnumbergt must be ordered from 1 up.    The ltsizegt is the total size of the segment which is equally divided   across all stripes forming  the segment. Its specification can be in   gigabytes g, megabytes m, kilobytes k or in database blocks   b, the default    Note that the segment size must be a multiple of the database page size   which is currently 8k. Also, the segment size must be divisible by the   number of stripe files forming  the segment.    The example below creates a 200 meg database striped on two segments   with two stripes of 50 meg and one of 100 meg.    You can always add more segments to the configuration, but once   added, do not change the setup.

Negative 3981 pI would like to implement dragndrop feature for Android 2.2. I override onTouchListener for each my control. But all my controls are inside ScrollView. When all my controls are visible on in ScrollView, then drandrop works fine. But when not all controls are visible on screnn and scrolling appears, I cant use drandrop. All events come to ScrollView and only scrollview proceed them. Contols didnt get touch events and as result, I cant drag my controls. Does anybody know how to resolve this issue I suppose, that scrollview should proceed self touch event, but then it should transfer this touch event to the children controls. How can I do it Or any other solutions Thanks.p

Negative 3981 pI am reading .obj files for my program, and doing curvature computations on them. The present .obj files are triangle meshes, with vertices and faces. They dont have any associated .mtl file. Based on the curvature, I have to assign a color to each vertex, and they are different for all the vertices. I want to display the .obj file now, but I want the vertices to be colored based on the color I assign to them. What is the best way of displaying such a filep  pInitially I thought of writing my own .mtl file and modify my input .obj file as well. But as the number of vertices are of the order of 50000, each having its own color, specifying a .mtl file with 50000 materials seems to be very daunting indeed.p  pI read somewhere that .ply files can handle colors more easily, but am not sure how to go about doing this.p  pThanks in advance for any help.

Negative 3981 pI have decided to try and make my websites more accessible to screen readers and other assistive technologies. At the moment Im really focussing on my navigation.

Negative 3981 pstrongEDITstrong p  pFrom poking around more Im almost positive that the problem is that when I inflate the layouts in my codeFragmentActivitycodes onCreate method, there are different views inflated within the ViewPager. So when I try to access them using the codexml1.findViewByIdcode its looking at a different View. How can I access the views that are being used in the codeViewPagercode Looking into my codeFragmentPagerAdaptercode it looks like the Fragments are created as new objects every time they are more than 1 swipe away. I want all 4 views to be intialized once. Then every time I call codeupdateUIcode the four views are altered at once. So I can swipe between all four views with them newly updated. p  pI tried using codepagerAdapter.getItemindex.getView.findViewById code, but it returns a codeNullPointerExceptioncode. After I got the exception, I tried overriding the codegetViewcode method in my codeFragmentcode classes. All I put in the method was codereturn viewcode, where view was a saved instance of the View returned in the codeonCreateViewcode method. This resulted in my ViewPager showing 4 blank screens to swipe between.p  pI added my codeFragmentPagerAdaptercode implementation to the bottom of the question. p  pstrongEnd Editstrongp  pI tried to implement a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidsupportv4viewViewPager.html relnofollowcodeViewPagercodea by using codeFragmentscode.

There are codeLogCatcode calls throughout my codepopulateSpinnerscode method that show me what I expect, but the codeSpinnerscode themselves are not populated.p  pThe strongSECONDstrong problem arises in the codeupdateUIcode method. The comments below all of the codefindViewByIdcode calls are where I do certain calculations to determine what text to put in the codeTextViewscode, what index to set the codeSpinnerscode to, and whether or not to check the codeCheckBoxescode. I have codeLogCatcode calls showing the values found, and they are all what is expected.  When the code.setText, .setSelection, and .setCheckedcode methods are called, no errors are shown, but none of the items are set at all. Everything stays blank. p  pThe strongTHIRDstrong problem is what is confusing me the most. The codeTextViewscode now all have unique IDs. When I first tried implementing this codeViewPagercode, I had the codeupdateUIcode method deal with TextViews without the codexml.code prefix to the codefindViewByIdcode calls.p  precodeview1a  TextView findViewById R.id.viewonea  view1b  TextView findViewById R.id.viewoneb  view2a  TextView findViewById R.id.viewtwoa  view2b  TextView findViewById R.id.viewtwob  view3a  TextView findViewById R.id.viewthreea  view3b  TextView findViewById R.id.viewthreeb  view4a  TextView findViewById R.id.viewfoura  view4b  TextView findViewById R.id.viewfourb   There is work done here to determine what to set  the different TextViews text to. view.setText whatever  codepre  pThis method resulted in a codeNullPointerExceptioncode, but only when calling code.setTextcode with the codeTextViewscode on the THIRD and FOURTH page. The first two pages did not throw any exceptions. So I commented out the third and fourth pages. The program ran and the first two pages showed the correct values in the correct TextViews. I then tried adding codexml.code to the codefindViewByIdcode methods, and now there are no exceptions thrown, but no Views are updated at all.p  pstrongFinal Notestrong The codeViewPagercode functions correctly, and I can swipe between the proper layouts very nicely. The problems occur when I try to update the Views with the values I want. I am assuming the problem has something to do with how I am inflating the layouts, or how I do it too many times. The third problem really perplexes me. I cannot find any differences between the firstsecond page and the thirdfourth page, but they are clearly acting differently. ALSO, the first code block shown is represented as an codeActivitycode, and the second code block I switched to a codeFragmentActivitycode.p  pstrongEDIT to add FragmentPagerAdapterstrongp  precodepublic class MoreParmsFragmentPagerAdapter extends FragmentPagerAdapter      final int PAGECOUNT  4      public MoreParmsFragmentPagerAdapter FragmentManager fm           superfm           public Fragment getItem int arg0           if arg0  0               xmlOneFragment xml1Frag  new xmlOneFragment             Bundle data  new Bundle             data.putInt currentpage, arg0              xmlOneFrag.setArguments data              return xmlOneFrag          else if arg0  1               xmlTwoFragment xml2Frag  new xmlTwoFragment             Bundle data  new Bundle             data.putInt currentpage, arg0              xmlTwoFrag.setArguments data              return xmlTwoFrag          else if arg0  2               xmlThreeFragment xml3Frag  new xmlThreeFragment             Bundle data  new Bundle             data.putInt currentpage, arg0              xmlThreeFrag.setArguments data              return xmlThreeFrag          else              xmlFourFragment xml4Frag  new xmlFourFragment             Bundle data  new Bundle             data.putInt currentpage,  arg0              xmlFourFrag.setArguments data              return xmlFourFrag                    Override     public CharSequence getPageTitleint position          if position  0               return xml1          else if position  1              return xml2          else if position  2               return xml3          else              return xml4                    Override     public int getCount           TODO Autogenerated method stub         return PAGECOUNT   codepre  pstrongEDIT 2strongp  precodeprivate ViewPager mViewPager private MoreParmsFragmentPagerAdapter pagerAdapter private FragmentManager fm private AntiPumpFragment apFrag private RelaxedCloseFragment relFrag private MiscParmsFragment miscFrag private DNP3Fragment dnpFrag  public void onCreate Bundle savedInstanceState       super.onCreate savedInstanceState      mViewPager  ViewPager findViewById R.id.pager      fm  getSupportFragmentManager     pagerAdapter  new MoreParmsFragmentPagerAdapterfm     mViewPager.setAdapter pagerAdapter       apFrag  AntiPumpFragment fm.findFragmentByTag androidswitcher  R.id.pager  0      relFrag  RelaxedCloseFragment fm.findFragmentByTag androidswitcher  R.id.pager  1      miscFrag  MiscParmsFragment fm.findFragmentByTag androidswitcher  R.id.pager  2      dnpFrag  DNP3Fragment fm.findFragmentByTag androidswitcher  R.id.pager  3  codepre  pEverywhere in my code, all of these Fragments return null.

Negative 3981 pThis is more of a theory question. I have a page with a bunch of various textfields, dropdown boxes, etc. Each user has hisher own page that can be updated via this update page that I am referring to. He updates the fields at his choosing. It passes about 30 variables if every field is inputted to a preview page. If the person likes the preview page, then they click an update button at the bottom of the preview page and all the various variables are updated into the appropriate MySQL table and their own page that others see is updated dynamically. let me know if this explanation isnt clear.p  pInserting this information for the first time is easy. However, when a user wants to update only a few of the fields for his page later, this is where I am confused. How do I make the MySQL update query dynamic to recognize an update to ONLY the fields on the page that the user wants to update while he leaves the other fields blank, thus leaving the old information intact for those columns, and they are disregarded in the update query.p  pLet me know if what Im asking doesnt make sense and Ill try again.p  pThanks for your help.p

Negative 3981 pProblemp  pI have a conceptual problem with reusing an old controller instance when the user reenters the route. In many examples, the controller stores the state of user interaction in instance variables. When the user reenters the controller those should be reset, but there is no clear mechanism for doing so.p  pSo, there must be a good reason to use a single controller instance. What is itp  pHow I arrived at this issuep  pI ran into a bug in out Ember app, where the controller keeps local state that got out of sync based on the user actions elsewhere. The controller maintains a state whether the user is editing the name of a case. When the controller is instantiated, that is set to true, but when the user cancels, its set to false. Then the user goes away to a different route and comes back to the same route. I get the same controller instance that already has false for editing the name. I would expect to have true instead.p  pEmber v.s. Railsp  pIm coming from Rails perspective where controller is instantiated for every request. There is no shared controller state between requests. All instance variables are local to the request, so they can be used safely.p  pBack to the question Why does ember use the same controller instance on separate visits to a routep

Negative 3981 pI have some sampled univariate data  but the clock driving the sampling process is inaccurate  resulting in a random slip of less than 1 sample every 30.  A more accurate clock at approximately 130 of the frequency provides reliable samples for the same data ... allowing me to establish a good estimate of the clock drift.p  pI am looking to interpolate the sampled data to correct for this so that I fit the high frequency data to the lowfrequency.  I need to do this real time  with no more than the latency of a few lowfrequency samples.p  pI recognise that there is a wide range of interpolation algorithms  and, among those Ive considered, a spline based approach looks most promising for this data.p  pIm working in Python  and have found the scipy.interpolate package  though I could see no obvious way to use it to stretch n samples to correct a small timing error.  Am I overlooking somethingp  pI am interested in pointers to either a suitable published algorithm, or  ideally  a Python library function to achieve this sort of transform.  Is this supported by SciPy or anything elsep  pUPDATE...p  pIm beginning to realise that what, at first, seemed a trivial problem isnt as straightforward as I first thought.  I am nolonger convinced that naive use of splines will suffice.  Ive also realised that my problem can be better described without reference to clock drift... like thisp  pA single random variable is sampled at two different frequencies  one low and one high, with no common divisor  e.g. 5hz and 144hz.  If we assume sample 0 is identical at both sample rates, sample 1 5hz falls between samples 28 amd 29.  I want to construct a new series  at 720hz, say  that fits all the known data points as smoothly as possible.p  pI had hoped to find an out of the box solution.p

Negative 3981 pIm converting html page for Kindle. The page have multiple CSS files.

Negative 3981 pWhen an event fires that should act on the focused control not the control that fired the event, how do you handle this in the ModelGUIMediator MGM pattern I suspect this question also applies to the closely related a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiModelE28093viewE28093presenter relnofollowMVP patterna if you have more than one model.p  pI titled this delegating events because I think the mediator for the eventoriginating control has to delegate the event to the mediator for the selected control or to its model  but the question is, howp  pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pThe MGM pattern is a bit like a hrefhttpmartinfowler.comeaaDevPassiveScreen.html relnofollowMVP Passive Viewa, except that you have a separate mediator for each control rather than one presenter per form. A controls events are all handled by its mediator, and the mediator calls methods of its particular model in response. The mediator is an a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiObserverpattern relnofollowobservera of the model and updates its control when the model changes. Its particularly suitable in a RAD environment where your controls dont have data binding and you dont want to subclass them. It also has the advantage that theres very little boilerplate code to hook up events, unlike Passive View.

Only one of these views can be selected at a time. Imagine a multidocument editor if you want something concrete.pli lipA user invokes a command from a menu. This calls the Execute method in the particular menu items mediator object. The menu item is a control, so it has a corresponding mediator.pli lipThe command is supposed to perform an action on the currently selected control.pli lipSo the menu items mediator needs to find either the mediator belonging to the selected control and delegate the action there, or it needs to find the model associated with the selected controls mediator and call that directly.pli ol  pBut how does the menu items mediator find the selected controls mediatorp  pIn MGM, mediator objects are supposed to be selfcontained, so dont know about other mediator objects. The controls are not allowed to know anything about the models to maintain clear separation of concerns. The only thing the controls know about their mediators are the event handlers.p  pstrongHacky workaroundstrongp  pThe best Ive come up with so far is to examine an event field in the selected control, which will be an object method pointer to that controls mediator. In Delphi I can cast this to a TMethod and hence extract the object pointer for the controls mediator. I can then cast this to the mediators type and call the required method.p  pBut this seems to rely heavily on a language feature TMethod and also creates dependencies between the mediator classes.p  pPerhaps Im on the wrong track entirelyp  pP.S.

Negative 3981 pI realize this question has been asked a million times but I cant seem to find the answer Im looking for.p  pThe first question I cant find a straight answer for is am I able to use category.php to display custom post typesp  pIf so then howp  pI have a singlecustomposttype.php  works perfectly, same with an arhcivecustomposttype.php but as Im sure you experienced WordPress developers know once I click on customposttype category it list normal post types and not the custom post types.p  pFor instance I have a custom post type called portfoliopost I currently have two categories called book covers and theatrical. I know I can create categorycustomposttype.php pages but I am trying to avoid having to go in and create a new page every time my client decides to create a new portfolio category.p  pSo it would be ideal if I could just modify category.php to handle custom post types. Im somewhat new to WP development and I really need to get this down because this will be a great tool for future projects.p  pANYWAY, any help would be much appreciated Also on an another note is there anyway to only show categories associated with a custom post type in admin Currently if I select categories under Portfolio Post it displays your standard blog post categories as well.p  pThank you so muchp

If I am just working with this single object then I can graph it fine by just skipping that element and the line will just be inaccurate on that day.p  pThe problem I get is when I have multiple sources, and at least one of them succeeded in reporting its results for that day. I have a queryset that gets a sum of the all the daily countsp  precodeDailyCount.objects.valuesdate.annotatecountSumcount.orderbydate codepre  pThe results from this show a much lower number on the entry for the 12th. Making the graph look very wrong whenever this happens.p  precode date         count   10112013    65  11112013    71  12112013    17  13112013    83 codepre  pIs there a way to have my queryset use the previous dates count if it doesnt exist I thought about adding the previous days count to the database, but it doesnt seem right to be adding some probably wrong data to the database when I cant verify it.p  pideally I think it would look likep  precode date         count   10112013    65  11112013    71  12112013    69  13112013    83 codepre
Negative 3981 pIm trying to set an account activity to display as a result of an onItemClick and am storing the account information in a SQLite database that I am hoping to have displayed according to the respective Account name clicked in the listview.

Negative 3981 pIm trying to write a function in Node to recursively retrieve Wikipedia category trees.

That is working without issue.p  pRight now the only way to remove filters is to click the codeClearcode link, which should replace all of the codespancodes that have codesetfiltercode classes either with the original category names or with existing sort actions.p  pThe trouble I have been having is with being able to select all of the spans with codesortfiltercode on them at once and then cycle through to change text and class accordingly. I currently have coffeescript code that does thisp  precodetarget  event.target  this will be the clear button categorySpan  target.parents.menubar.eq0.find.setfilter ltlt code to perform actions on categorySpan gtgt codepre  pright now this obviously doesnt work, it will only perform a blanket action on all selected spans rather than cycle through each span individually. I originally tried it as this insteadp  precodefor categorySpan in target.parents.menubar.eq0.find.setfilter codepre  pbut then I wasnt able to get access to key attributes of the span, like text.p  pWhat is the correct way to do this kind of cycling operationp

Negative 3981 pIve installed Microsoft SQL Server 2012 Express with Advanced Services on Windows 7 64bit. During installation I chose to configure the SQL Server instance as the Default instance, and as a result I am able to connect to it using TCPIT by specifying either localhost, local, MyComputerName, or . in the Server name field in Microsoft SQL Server  Management Studio in each case the connection shows up on the lefthand column of SQL Server Management Studio as SQL Server 11.0.3128  MyComputerNameMyUserName. However when I access the Services window from the Control Panels Administration Tools, I can see that the installed SQL Server instance is running using the connection name NT ServiceMSSQLSERVER. This corresponds to the Instance ID MSSQLSERVER which appeared automatically during installation when I chose Default instance. What I would like to ask isp  pGiven this configuration, why cant I connect by specifying MSSQLSERVER or alternatively NT ServiceMSSQLSERVER in the server name field in SQL Server Management Studio How can I get this alternative connection mechanism to work without recreating a new SQL Server instancep  pPerhaps I dont fully understand how connections, connection strings, and connection types work under Winodows, and what the underlying Windowsspecific connection protocols are. Perhaps someone can point these details out and sort out any confusing issues related to these which arise when someone know about TCPIP but not so much about proprietary Windows network protocols.p  pThanks.p

Negative 3981 pstrongBackgroundstrong I have a fairly simple codebashcode script that Im using to generate a codeCSVcode log file.  As part of that bash script I poll other devices on my network using codenetcatcode.  The codenetcatcode command returns a stream of information that I can pipe that into a codegrepcode command to get to certain values I need in the codeCSVcode file.  I save that return value from codegrepcode into a codebashcode variable and then at the end of the script, I write out all saved codebashcode variables to a codeCSVcode file. Simple enough. p  pThe change Id like to make is the amount of codenetcatcode commands I have to issue for each piece of information I want to save off.  With each issued codenetcatcode command I get ALL possible values returned so each time returns the same data and is burdensome on the network.  So, Id like to only use codenetcatcode once and parse the return value as many times as I need to create the codebashcode variables that can later be concatenated together into a single record in the codeCSVcode file Im creating.  p  pstrongSpecific Questionstrong Using codebashcode syntax if I pass the output of the codenetcatcode command to a file using codegtcode versus the current codegrepcodemethod I get a file with each entry on its own line presumably separated with the codencode as the EOL record separator  easy for perl regex.  However, if I save the output of codenetcatcode directly to a codebashcode variable, and echo that variable, all of the data is jumbled together, so it is cumbersome to parse out not so easy.p  pI have played with two options First, I think a perl oneliner may be a good solution here, but Im not sure how to best execute it.  Pseudo code might be to save the codenetcatcode output to a a bash variable and then somehow figure out how to parse it with perl not straight forward though.p  pThe second option would be to use codebashcodes codegtcode and send codenetcatcodes output to a file.  This would be easy to process with codeperlcode and Regex given the codencode codeEOLcode, but that would require opening an external file and passing it to a codeperlcode script for processing AND then somehow passing its return value back into the codebashcode script as a codebashcode variable for entry into the codeCSVcode file.p  pI know Im missing something simple here.  Is there a way I can force a newline entry into the codebashcode variable from codenetcatcode and then repeatedly run a perlone liner against that variable to create each of the codeCSVcode variables I need  all within the same codebashcode script  Sorry, for the long question. p

Negative 3981 pI have to find the shortest path from point D to R. These are fixed points. This is an example of a situationp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com6nXd3.png altenter image description herep  pThe box also contains walls, through which you cannot pass across them, unless you break them. Each wall break costs you, lets say a points, where a is a positive integer. Each move which doesnt involve a wall, costs you 1 point.p  pThe mission is to find out of all the paths of minimum cost, the one with the least number of broken walls.p  pSince, the width of the box can go up to 100 cells, its irrelevant to use backtracking. Its too slow. The only solution I came up is this onep  ol liGo east or south if there are no wallsli liIf south has a wall, check if west has wall. If west has wall, break south wall. If west doesnt have wall, go west, until you find a south cell without wall. Repeat this process with south and east until you exceed the cost of a broken wall in this order. If path from west goes into the same place as if I had broken the south wall and costs the same or less than a points, then use this path, else brake south wall.li liIf nothing above encounters, brake a south or east wall, depending on the box boundary.li ol  pRepeat steps 1, 2, 3 till the passenger arrives in point R. Between these 3 steps, there are elseif relations.p  pCan you come up with a better problem algorithm I program in C.p

Negative 3981 pI have an Xcode 5 CI server running my XCTest unit tests.p  pMy test cases rely on breakpoints to trigger specific actions. These actions are essential to the running of the tests.p  pEverything passes if I run the tests locally. The problem is when a bot runs the tests on the server it seems as though breakpoints are ignored.p  pI tried a sample breakpoint, with an alert sound, just for testing. I shared the breakpoint  and committed the shared breakpoint to the projects git repository. The bot correctly checks out the project with the breakpoint included I can verify this by examining the project in LibraryServerXcodeDataBotRunsCache....p  pHowever, when the bot runs the breakpoint is NOT triggered. I dont hear the sound and execution does not pause.p  pThis behaviour obviously makes sense for most cases, but in my specific case  is there any way to configure the bot so that breakpoints are not ignoredp

Negative 3981 pAt work we lost our team member who did all the wpf and I have picking up where he left off. This is the first time I have worked on wpf so I really dont know too much.p  pI have a two dimensional array of doubles that have a dynamic number of rows and columns.

Negative 3981 pIm planning on making a MVC5 application that has the functionality to record a 2 second video from a users webcam and store it in a separate storage.p  pI have done some searching but cannot find a clear way on how to collect a video from a webcam. Some options that I found are via Flash e.g, a hrefhttpwww.red5recorder.com relnofollowRed5 recordera, a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryff60228228vvs.9529.aspx relnofollowSilverLighta or a hrefhttpwww.xarg.orgprojectjquerywebcamplugin relnofollowjQuery webcam plugina. The latter only seems to record images, SilverLight seems a bit of a hassle and Red5 seems to fill my needs. p  pI also found some C frameworks with might be best since it will be a MVC5 application. Maybe a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comArticles202464HowtouseaWebCaminCwiththeNETFramework4 relnofollowExpression Encodeda or a hrefhttpwww.aforgenet.comaforgeframework relnofollowAForge.NETa are good choicesp  pMy goal it to collect two seconds videos of users where the user can control when it starts recording and when it finishes. If good means that it is easy to use, customizable and that it has a fast performance, then what is according to you a good way to accomplish thisp
Negative 3981 pIm trying to build this project using Caliburn for the first time and also the MEF structure, that I didnt fully understand.p  pI need to use both the Conductor and the EventAggregator. The Conductor because i have an AppViewModel which displays 3 buttons that move the user to 3 different views UserControls inside AppView. p  pAnd I need the EventAggregator because one of these 3 views has a button inside of it that must load 4th view that must be a Window I think, not a UserControl, because it has to be full screen.

But var[foo] will complain saying RuntimeError Value is not callable not TYPECODEFUNC. I believe the value type will be gdb.TYPECODEMETHOD not sure, but var[foo].type.code returns 16 in my case.

Negative 3981 pI noticed when trying to code a CLR procedure for SQL Server that HashSet is not allowed due to being attributed with code[HostProtectionAttributeSecurityAction.LinkDemand, MayLeakOnAbort  true]code. SQL Server CLR procedures do not allow the use of objects where codeMayLeakOnAbortcode is set. Okay, so there are some classes to avoid in CLR procedures, and maybe even think twice about using outside of CLR procedures. The strange thing is that codeDictionaryltK,Vgtcode is emnotem similarly restricted. Now based on my understanding of what a HashSet is and what a Dictionary is, I expect that a Dictionary should have all the complexity of a Hashset and emthenem some. Why is it, then, that Dictionary is not similarly restricted Im doing my think twice about using codeHashSetltTgtcode and seriously considering using a Dictionary instead even though Im not writing a CLR procedure and need nothing more than a collection that can be quickly tested for membership of a complex key object reference for an object that has no comparison, hashing or equality interfaces defined. Am I better off using a Hashset or Dictionary Is Hashset different in that it will allow the use of classes with no comparison or equality interfaces based purely on memory addresses or something which might be why a HashSet is less cleanp

Negative 3981 pIm blocked since a few days with Hibernate caching in a Spring context using Transactional annotations.p  pI tried all the solutions found on the web without success...p  pThe single solution that work is to use the Cacheable Spring annotation from springcontextsupport, but Im not satisfied because I cannot use the Hibernate Cache annotation on my entities.

I wont do it for all my referential data classes...p  pA real solution is just to have a working Hibernate Cache annotation to put on the ChannelEntity.p  pTo get it functional, I even have developed my own SingletonEhCacheRegionFactory class initialize with the Spring class EhCacheManagerFactoryBean as cache manager.

Negative 3981 pLets say we have two classes, codeBasecode and codeChildcode. codeChildcode inherits codeBasecode. codeValuecode is a constant variable or a enum value defined in codeBasecode, so it can be accessed by codeBaseValuecode.p  pNow we are dealing with some variables of type codeChildcode. I notice that in many documents and sample codes, people tend to use codeBaseValuecode instead of codeChildValuecode though they are dealing with codeChildcode instances. For example, in Qt library there are codeQIODevicecode and codeQBuffercode the later is a child of the former, and codeQBuffercode has a method codeopencode. The documents tend to use something like codebuffer.openQIODeviceReadWrite, ...code instead of codebuffer.openQBufferReadWrite, ...code. There are many other examples I believe you all have seen frequently.p  pIm a bit curious why people tend to use the base classes to access those values, since sometimes we dont know for sure in which classes is the value defined, and more importantly, it is possible that the child classes may override the values defined in base classes. So isnt it the best to access constant values through the current class codeWhateverClassBeingUsedValuecodep

Negative 3981 pOne of the projects Im currently working on includes a Java Swing application for field users to input data about equipment parts scattered all over the companies facilities. Most of the data collected is measured field validation is required or some value the operator can choose from a predefined list.The software then does some calculation and displays back instructions to the operator.p  pso for example for part number 3435AfB, engineering requires the operator to measure  the diameter of some bolt and choose the part maker from a list. the application then compares the measured diameter to the stock diameter and tells the operator if it should be replaced this is obviously not a real world example, but you get the ideap  pThe problem is there are over 200 known equipment parts and these are pretty old and heterogeneous so the engineering team has a limited idea of what they would like to measure on each part in the future. It doesnt seam reasonable to have the development team write and maintain over 200 different classes but doesnt seem realistic to have the engineers use a complicated system of form builders and BPM like drools im getting sweaty just thinking about it.p  pWere currently trying to make a poor mans solution that would allow the engineers to build forms with a simple GUI having limited features and outputting the forms to XML files. The few complicated cases not covered by the GUI solution would be custom made by the developers very few cases. For the calculation part, we would use Java Expression library JEL, the expressions to evaluate would be generated by the same GUI.p  pBefore we commit to this solution, I was wondering if there is something we could do differently to have a more robust system. I know that some people will consider this too much softcoding and I agree that it is going to be difficult extracting and treating the data.p
Negative 3981 pSuppose I have a large alist, where there are multiple items with the same key but same or different valuesp  precodea . 1   b . 2   a . 3   a . 4   b . 5   b . 6 codepre  pUsually when you use alists, you access items with codeassoccode, which returns the first matching item in a list and ignores the rest. So the idiomatic way to treat alists is that every time you want to replace an item in alist with a new value for an old key, you just add a new dotted pair and ignore the old one. So no matter how many duplicates you have, codeassoccode will ignore them. You work via alist API and ignore the implementation details, so to speak. But what if I honestly want to have an alist with all duplicates physically removed With only the newest dotted pairs remaining in the list, so the above alist would become codea . 1 b . 2codep  pAny solution for both Common Lisp or Emacs Lisp is acceptable.p

This seemed like the right approach, although now I have built it I can see that the shared variable is accessible throughout the entire application.p  pSo like this for instantiation and assignment.p  precode    Questions.QuestionnaireUID  CIntquestionnaireUID codepre  pI dont even need to instantiate the class. So I now just have a global variable. to get around this I would use a class level variable instead of.

Is there a step I am missing.p  pThanks for any advice.p

Negative 3981 pI have a wpf application that needs to pop up in front all other windows based on certain conditions. I am trying to accomplish this in an MVVM compliant manner. After a lot of research, the best solution involves using the windows activate event and interfaces behavior. I was able to get the activate function to work using the second solution found on a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11941401howtobringwindowtofrontwithwpfandusingmvvmmvvm activatea . However, once I style my GUI using Mahapp Metro control MetroWindow based on the  a hrefhttpmahapps.comguidesquickstart.html relnofollowquickstart guidea, the GUI messes up. Whenever the XAML interaction behavior section is added, the GUIs original Window object appears, resulting with 2 title bars one from Window and other from MetroWindow. I tried designing my own window using Metro stylings but so far unable to implement the Metro title bar cant find any guides or documentation on doing so.

Negative 3981 pIs it faster to allocate large data structures like OpenCV images or stdvectors outside a loop, that are used in every iteration of a loop, but need to be reset e.g. set OpenCV Mat to Scalar0 Or should one just instantiate a new one inside the loop p  pEdit I was looking for a rule of thumb, if creating a new default constructed OpenCV Mat containing zeros, is as fast, faster or slower than resetting the Mat in every loop. If there are too many different compiler behaviors affecting the outcome, so that one has to measure it, this would be an answer I was looking for too. Thanks to everybody, who are giving this a thoughtp

Negative 3981 pI realise this question probably doesnt suit the QampA format of SO, though I figured this is by far the best community to provide some insight into this. What is the difference between Forms Authentication, MembershipProvider, SimpleMemberShipProvider and Sessions when it comes to tackling authorisation and authenticationp  pI wont ask which is better as that would obviously depend on the purpose of its implementation. I am of the understanding that managing this data through sessions is generally not applicable for this, though the list I provided most likely is not an exhaustive one.p  pI am unsure as to the benefits and limitations of each and how best to implement them. Ideally I would be making a web forms application using VB.NET but am fine with C and MVC as well.p  pAny help or online resources that can clear this up would be a great help.p

I have attached an image, of my idea. Anybody can suggest something p  pAfter a lot of Googling I found that getting the screen resolution and subtract from height and width of the window will give me the desire result.

Negative 3981 pI am wanting to make a web application which uses the Google Drive API to access a friends spreadsheet located on his Google Drive.  It will be readingwriting to the sheet but nothing more, and only that sheet.  Suffice to say, I have spent the last two days reading up documentation for the Google Drive API and have little to show for it.  I just cant make sense of it, no matter how many examples I read because the API doesnt match what the examples show.  There must be 45 different ways that I found of authentication with OAuth2.0 but none will work with the Drive API that I got off the NuGet package manager which is where Google said to get the latest API.  Nothing makes sense. The OAuth2Parameters class doesnt exist so I dont know how to authenticate with the examples google gives.  Similar ways end with the same result with other examples, like Googles DrEdit.  Can anyone provide some insight  The spreadsheet will be hosted by my friend me if necessary and the web application will be hosted by a free service, say AppHarbor.  Thank you very much.p
Negative 3981 pI am trying to write a taskrunner for command line. No rationale. Just wanted to do it.

Negative 3981 pUnfortunately, I cant reproduce the issue in jsfiddle, but this test file reproduces the issue a hrefhttpsgithub.comkaneseechromedialogbackissueblobmastertestdialogback.html relnofollowgithub fileap  pBasically, I have a standard popup and a close button inside that popup. I can open the popup. I can close the popup. I can do this over and over again without a problem.p  pHowever, when I bind the popupafterclose event to the popup, which reopens the popup after receiving that event. Now something weird happens. On my iPhone 5Ss Chrome v38.0.2125.67, after the second close, the page goes back beyond the popup and to the previous page, as if it was hitting back twice.p  pThis only happens on my phones chrome. The test page works fine on my phones safari. it also works fine on my macs chrome v38.0.2125.104.p  pI suspect this may be some sort of bug prevention mechanism like preventing too many popups or infinite loops, but wanted to confirm. Im hoping Im just doing something wrong in my code.p  pIf you comment out the popupafterclose event, youll see that you can openclose the popup again and again in every browser including mobile chrome. But automatically reopening the popup and closing it leads to backing out twice.p  pYou may be wondering why I would want to immediately open the popup after I just closed it. My app has a play function that initiates the popup. Upon closing it, I want it to continue to play after the popup closes, and some time later, the popup may initiate the popup again. After closing that second instance of the popup, my app backs out of itself.p

Then, even more frustratingly, Im going to want to grab the next 7, and then again the next 7 with a provided offset.p  pWhats the best course of action Is there way to query the DB in such a way as to return an amalgamated result set thatll allow me to easily offset by 7 to grab the next 7 Theres gotta be something more clever than, say, keeping track of the createdAt date or some other malarky. p

If you use VS2010 and maybe newer, do not open the  ltatgt c .sln file, but      ltatgt c .dsw file for older Visual C since it does not contain mobile targets     preventing from import.  Create empty file  ltatgt c pjlibincludepjconfigsite.h     or copy it from  ltatgt c configsitesample.h and add following code  ltatgt code define PJDLL  1 ifdef LIB    define PJEXPORTING 1 endif  ltatgt endcode     This will build PJProject using shared libraries.

At project  ltatgt c pjsualib, set Configuration type to DLL and check  dependencies     to the same values as in  ltatgt c libpjproject.     Add  ltatgt c ws232.lib into linker input libraries.

Negative 3981 pIm writing some code to format a hex number, and currently it accepts an unsigned 64bit value.

Specifically, a better way that works with C03 and C11.

Negative 3981 pDjango adds add, change, and delete permissions to every model by default.  You can override this on a permodel basis by the new codedefaultpermssionscode option in Django 1.7.

Negative 3981 pI have an excel workbook that interacts with a webservice that has authentication. The first time I make a webservice request using VBA with XMLHTTP I have to enter my userid and password in a popup box from the webservice. Excel remembers the userid and password for each successive xml request that I make up until I close the Excel application. The REST webservices authentication tool is stateless so Im not keeping a connection. I have a need to capture the userid entered by the user to use it in the webservices URL for a GET request. Is there a way to capture the users userid from Excel using VBA so that I dont have the prompt the user twice for the same informationp  pstrongKatzstrong, Thank you for the response. I am familiar with these functions. My scenario is different in that I am interacting with an external secure webservice that requires a different userid than my windows domain. In my case the webservice is stateless and each time I call it, it requires the useridpassword unique to the service. When sending requests to this webservice through Excel using VBA, Excel somehow remembers the userid and password and as long as I dont close the instance of Excel, I do not need have to enter the useridpassword interactively. I need to be able to extract just the userid from where ever Excel is sourcing this information so that I can place it in the GET request as userid can be used in the GET request as filtering criteria for the response from the webservice. p  pThis userid has to be stored somewhere in excel or in the system enviroment to be reused when subsequent GET requests are sent to this webservice in order to suppress the logon window after the first request. Any help would be appreciated.p

Negative 3981 pHello everyone I am having a issue with a method that I am trying to create. My method is supposed to take the month, day, and year that are previously defined in the class, and then split them up with  marks. So if the values for month, day, year in that order were 1, 2, 14 it would print out as 1214 I am using a separate class to test if it works. So far I have this for my methodp  precodepublic String DateTest     DateTest  month  day  year     return DateTest  codepre  pwith public String DateTest being defined above it with the rest of the values. How can I create a method that returns the three integer values with s dividing them I am not sure on how to get the s in therep  pHere is the code where I would be initializing the variablesp  precodepublic class Date  public int month public int day public int year public String DateTest  public void setMonthint month     this.month  month  public int getMonth     return month   public void setDayint day     this.day  day  public int getDay     return day   public void setYearint year     this.year  year  public int getYear     return year  codepre

Negative 3981 pWhats the other way of creating a digital signature using a private key thats on a smart card, with certificate installed in local certificate store in .NET Framework other than this one, for I have no clue as to how to find out the key container name and it seems like no one else doesp  precodeCspParameters cspa  gcnew CspParametersProviderType, ProviderName, keyContainerName, cryptoSecurityKey, securityString  RSACryptoServiceProvider csp  gcnew RSACryptoServiceProvidercspa  csp.SignHash codepre  pThe way I understand it, if one initializes CspParameters with no keyContainerName, Crypto Provider has no way of telling what certificate one wants to use for signing, so it just wont work. Ive searched the net for info and none found except for a couple unanswered questions. The only examples I have found use strings like example, test for keyContainerName. In case of a program which is going to be used by lots of people with lots of certificates and smart cards, this is useless because you need a method that looks at a chosen certificate and determines its container name like certutils.exe does and then creates CspParameters, RSACryptoServiceProvider and then signs. So this is out of question now.p  pSo what are other ways of generating a digital signature with a smart card in .NET Frameworkp

Negative 3981 pIm working with a data table which has a column of results which begin as character values codechrcode. Because I need to do mathematical calculations with some of these values I copy the original column, but change the values which are nonnumerics to specific numeric values. For example I use 999 for a result value of Not reported and set up similar substitute values for the nonnumeric characters. Other collected values are numbers such as 7.3 or 238. Result values vary based on the instruments used in collection and the characteristic being reported.p  pHeres a small sample of the data table codedtcode other columns excluded.p  precodeRESULTVALUE    RESULTTRANSLATED 43.2               43.2000 Not reported      999.00000 0.19               0.19000 0.058              0.05800 codepre  pThe codeRESULTTRANSLATEDcode values are converted using codedtRESULTTRANSLATED lt as.numericas.characterdtRESULTVALUEcode.p  pOption values for codescipencode and codedigitscode are 0 and 7 respectively.p  pThe codescipencode was set to 0 to force a column of location identifiers separate column not shown above to display as nonscientific numbers e.g. 23434 vs 2.3434e04. codeDigitscode was set to 7 to enable display of recorded field data without truncating values or decreasing their significant figures.p  pWhat Id like to see is a result more along these lines for the conversionp  precodeRESULTVALUE    RESULTTRANSLATED 43.2               43.2 Not reported      999 0.19               0.19 0.058              0.058 codepre  pHere, the translated data reflects the significant figures for the results versus adding accuracy that doesnt exist. So values like 0.058 dont imply a measurement of 0.05800 or 0.19 doesnt imply 0.19000 .p  pUnfortunately its appearing I cannot have my cake the location identifiers without scinotation and eat it too have proper accuracysig figs in converted results values. While I emcouldem ignore the location identification scientific notation possibly changing it to a codechrcode vs a codenumericcode column, changing the accuracy of the measurements is something I need to avoid. p  pPerhaps someone can enlighten me as to whether this is possible, particularly when the result set includes results reported from instruments with varying accuracy. Ive searched through the various resources and found some related topics, but nothing that quite addresses the issue.p  pThanks for your kind assistancedirection.p

Negative 3981 pI have added 6 different dropdown buttons to my Python code.  They all work just fine if you fire up the .py and use the interface.  However, when I resize the window, you can no longer interact with the lists.  This includes setting the app to run in full screen which is the end goal.  Is this a bug with Kivy or have I done something wrong  Also, what is the best way to add padding between the buttons.  They are populating a BoxLayout with a vertical orientation.  Basically, Id like them to match up with the corresponding label on the left.  I figured another series of BoxLayouts and setting heights would do it, but I am looking for an attribute for ease.

Negative 3981 pI am making a calculator. The UIButtons I am using for the numbers are being sluggish in that they do not accept a second tap for at least half a second while the button has finished its default glow animation after a tap.br For example, if I quickly tap a number is only adds every other tap to the calculator display.br Is there a way that I can get the button to respond quicker or do you think the glow animation on touch is responsiblebr If I tap different buttons quickly they are responsive, so that rules out inefficient coding.br Thanksp

Negative 3981 pI am working on a project that has an external API that I need to submit an image through, and the requirement of that API is that the image be a TIFF with Group 4 Compression.  I have tried several different approaches to convert my Bitmap to a TIFF including using JAI imageio in Android, porting libtiff into NDK and using OpenCV.  JAI imageio is commonly recommend on here as a possible solution, but I found that even when I found a standalone version of JAI imageio that I still had an unmet dependency on javax.imageio and as a result could not build my app.  Porting libtiff should work, and I have a branch in my code where I have begun this process, but due to the time required to do this I would prefer an alternate solution.  OpenCV I also started to implement, but I decided the requirement to install a secondary OpenCV Manager APK in order to use it is not acceptable for my app, in addition to this being significant overkill for solving a simple problem.p  pCurrently I have been working with the Android port of ImageMagick found here a hrefhttpsgithub.compaulasiimweAndroidImageMagick relnofollowhttpsgithub.compaulasiimweAndroidImageMagicka and this appears to be a promising approach.  So far I have set it up in my app and am able to output the image to a file in order to verify the image.  I am able to use it to convert to a couple different image formats, but when I try to convert to a TIFF I receive a SIGSEGV and the app crashes.p  pThe relevant code snippet isp  precodeMagickImage image  MagickBitmap.fromBitmapsizedImage image.setMagickTIFF image.setImageFormatTIFF image.setDepth1 image.setCompressionCompressionType.Group4Compression  ImageInfo info  new ImageInfo info.setMagickTIFF info.setCompressionCompressionType.Group4Compression  image.writeImageinfo codepre  pI have tried various permutations of the different calls to setMagick and setCompression, all of which yield the same result.  If a call to setMagickTIFF is made, then when it reaches image.writeImageinfo the app will crash with the following outputp  precodeFatal signal 11 SIGSEGV, code 1, fault addr 0x0 in tid 2283 codepre  pHas anyone used ImageMagick in Android to convert to a TIFF, or does anyone know of a clean method of converting to a TIFF in Android that is verified to actually work.  I know that it must be possible because there are apps on the Play Store for converting image formats which include converting to TIFF, including one from Paul Asiimwe, who published this Android port.p  pEDIT 1p  pBy using the following code I am able to get an uncompressed TIFF that appears to be correct in all other regards, but it just will not compress it to Group 4 compression.p  precodeMagickImage image  MagickBitmap.fromBitmapsizedImage image.setDepth1 image.setNumberColors2 ImageInfo info  new ImageInfoEnvironment.getExternalStoragePublicDirectoryEnvironment.DIRECTORYDOWNLOADSoutput.tiff image.setCompressionCompressionType.Group4Compression image.writeImageinfo  info.setColorspaceColorspaceType.GRAYColorspace info.setMonochrome1 info.setCompressionCompressionType.Group4Compression image.writeImageinfo  byte[] blob  image.imageToBlobinfo codepre

I believe the MobileServiceClient.UserId also exposed this as well.p  pNow, after Ive migrated to the new App Services Mobile App and Im using the Preview Portal now, which for the most part is pretty awesome, there is no longer a uid claim, but rather a single sid session id claim, something like sidABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ, no matter which provider I log in with. When I looked on the clientside at the MobileServiceClient.UserId value, it also gives this sid value.p  pThe point is that previously the uid token could uniquely identify a user. Now it is the same for all users across all providersp  pHow can I get the provider token with the App Services Mobile App that I was previously able to get with Azure Mobile Servicesp  pAlso, could anyone point me to the source code for the Azure Mobile Services 2.0.0beta Is it open source I cant seem to find it on GitHub. p  pEdit Here is a screenshot of the User on the server side img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comHO9p7.png altenter image description herep

Negative 3981 pIm working on a mapping tool based ol3 using GeoServer backend. I will have to publish many GeoJSON base vector layers and WMS raster tiles in it, but a little bit confused about selecting from them. In the examples, there are really good ones for one vector or WMS layer ol.interaction.Select and map.onsingleclick..., but cannot find solution for more complex situations. My questionsp  pIf you have strongmultiple vector layersstrong, using the ol.interaction.Select, is there a way to determine for each selected feature where do they come from which layer does they belong to I have to style them and present information about them based on their type its not my case but for example do other thing if you select a road or a city. For now, I attach a property to each feature before loading them to the ServerVector source, so when they selected, I can determine what to do with them. Without going into details I have a working solution this problem but wondering, is there any other officialpreferred way to do this p  pThe other one what can I do if the map has strongvector and raster layersstrong too I want it to be transparent for the users they click and get the information and its for the code to decide how to do this. Is there any solution for this Maybe ol.interaction.Select and the maps singleclick event together The interaction for vectors and the latter for the WMS layersp  pThanks in advance, Balazs Eignerp

Negative 3981 pA little backstory Some years ago, I was on a algorithm contest. By that time, I was learning C, and I didnt know how to write or read files using the normal methods.p  pIn order to no get confused by new methods and syntax, a C wizard, told me to add a couple of lines after the includes, and presto, any program that printed to the screen using printf and getting the input from the keyboard using scanf, would read and write to separate files declared in those lines.p  pThose codes only ran in Windows, so I dont know if it was portable.

Negative 3981 pI was wondering how pandas handles memory usage in python I was wondering more specifically how the memory is handled if I set a pandas dataframe query results to a variable. Behind the hood, would it just be some memory addresses to the original dataframe object or would I be cloning all of the datap  pIm afraid of memory ballooning out of control but I have a dataframe that has nonunique fields I cant index it by.  Its incredibly slow to query and plot data from it using commands like df[df[]  x amp df[]  y]. p  pTheyre both integer values in the rows. Theyre also not unique, hence the fact it returns multiple results.p  pIm very new to pandas anyway, but any insights as to how to handle a situation where Im looking for the arrays of values where two conditions match would be great too. Right now Im using an On algorithm to loop through and index it because even that runs faster than the search queries when I need to access the data quickly. Watching my system take twenty seconds on a dataset of only 6,000 rows is foreboding.p

Negative 3981 pI have the following controller actionp  precodepublic JsonResult AcceptChangesRoomPricing currentData, RoomPricing lastSaveData  ...  codepre  pThis controller receives JSON encoded objects from my AJAX requestp  precode.ajax      type POST,     url controllerURL,     data JSON.stringify currentData currentData, lastSaveData lastSaveData ,     ...  codepre  pThe AJAX request data is derived from a form in my partial view, which uses a ViewModel of type codeRoomPricingcode.  Current and lastSave data are respectively the updated and stale serialized versions of the form.  The purpose of these objects is to do form update checks serverside.  Serverside because the codeRoomPricingcode model includes an enumerable and other junk that would make reliable update checking complex and obnoxious to perform clientside.p  pNow, when the controller receives the currentData and lastSaveData, it automagically creates the RoomPricing objects, BUT both objects are identical, taking on the values of currentData.  To be clear lastSaveData is created, but only in name, as its contents are identical to that of currentData and so ignoring the data that was passed by AJAX, which I assume goes into the void.p  pI expect that this behavior is a side effect of MVC trying to be helpful with Model Binding.  Does anyone have a suggestion for getting around this problem  Making a superViewModel with two RoomPricing objects to use as the controller argument did not resolve this issue.p  pThanks in advancep  pemEdit The current and lastSave data comes from the following JQuery codeemp  precodevar lastSaveFormData  null     function AjaxSubmitForm          var lastSaveSerialized  lastSaveFormData  null  null  lastSaveFormData          var form  MyForm          submitOverrideForm             form.serialize,       currentData             lastSaveSerialized,     lastSaveData             form.attraction,                       lastSaveFormData  form.serialize      codepre  pThrough the above Im able to keep a record of all changes since the last save.  Although the models are somewhat complex, the size of the data being sent is quite small so I figured Id compare the data serverside, and here we are.  Last thing of note is that Ive verified that at this point  codeJSON.stringify currentData currentData, lastSaveData lastSaveData code  the encoded data is as expected...currentData and lastSaveData are unique if form updates have taken place.p  pemEdit I just noticed something else.
