Positive 2904 pIm trying to use dynamic memory allocation with a 2D array and I cant seem to get my function to work as intended. I want to pass my function a long string of characters, break up and store certain parts as individual strings in their own character arrays, then add them to a 2D array and return the final thing. The part of the function that splits the string up and stores what I want works fine. The memory allocation is what Im doing wrong.p  pFor example, I pass my function the string  0,,10000,10000,Albany Hwy After Armadale Rd,,32.1479054960,116.0201957650,4 and it pulls out 10000, 32.1479054960 and 116.0201957650, stores them in their own arrays, then adds it all into one array called stop. What Im attempting to do is allocate memory for my 3 strings that I will store, then as I add the strings I allocate memory for them as they are added.p  pHere is my functionp  precode char getStopDatachar line[]  int commas  0 int len  strlenline char stop  malloc3 Block of memory for each string char stopid[20] Temp array to build stopid string  char lat[20] Temp array to build lat string char lon[20] Temp array to build lon string int counter  forint i  0 i ltlen i       ifline[i]  ,           commas         counter  0         continue          switchcommas  Build strings here and store them  works fine         case 2              stopid[counter]  line[i]              ifline[i1]  , stopid[counter]  0             break         case 6               lat[counter]   line[i]              ifline[i1]  , lat[counter]  0             break         case 7               lon[counter]   line[i]             ifline[i1]  , lon[counter]  0             break       Assign memory for each string to be added to stop amp add my strings to stop stop[0]  mallocsizeofstopid stop[0]  stopid stop[1]  mallocsizeoflat stop[1]  lat stop[2]  mallocsizeoflon stop[2]  lon  return stop  codepre  pAnd my mainp  precodeint mainint argc, char argv[]  char  niceRows  getStopDataargv[1] for int i0 iltsizeofniceRows i          printfdn,niceRows[i]     freeniceRows[i]  freeniceRows return 0  codepre  pWhen I run my function I get a bunch of runtime errors to do with my memory allocation. error for object 0x7fff5266bb70 pointer being freed was not allocated  set a breakpoint in mallocerrorbreak to debugp
Positive 2904 pI am trying to move a gameobject with a defined path.

Positive 2904 pOur library a hrefhttpapinatomy.orghome relnofollowApiNATOMYa renders a treemap to navigate a hierarchical space like human anatomy, for instance. We used to use nested codeltdivgtcode elements for every tile, but the reflow process was a constant source of slowdown. Weve now switched to pure WebGL Three.js, and got a remarkable performance boost.p  pHowever, this did lose us the convenience of HTMLlike markup. It now requires 1020 lines of code to draw a box, and another 1020 to render some text. Having things stay centered when the box is resized is also a manual job, and I dont even dare dream of automatic linebreaks. Then theres the problem of codeTHREE.FontUtilscode being an incredibly slow way to render text. Ive found a way to do it with a a hrefhttpstemkoski.github.ioThree.jsTextureFromCanvas.html relnofollowseparate canvasa, but that also requires a lot of manual code, and is more inflexible w.r.t. sizing.p  pSo my question is Is there some library of utility classesfunctions to make these sorts of 2D jobs in Three.js easier and more robust Alternatively, any general tips or referencesp  pNote There will still be 3D aspects to ApiNATOMY, so a pure 2D renderer is not an option.p

Positive 2904 pIm using Three.js to render a number of 2D objects codeTHREE.PlaneGeometrycode arranged in layers.

Positive 2904 pI am building a 2D space game with SpriteKit.  I am going to have multi stage rockets, and I am using SKPhysicsJointFixed to connect the stages.  The game works great, until I am orbiting the Earth.  When the rocket moves around the Earth, the graphics jump every rotation at the same point.  By jump, I mean that the planet and rocket graphics looked jumbled for s brief moment, then everything looks normal.  This doesnt seem to happen when I am not using a physics joint.  I have posted my code for the space scene where this happens.  I would so greatly appreciate any suggestions  I have looked everywhere, and cant seem to find a solution.

Negative 2904 pI have a C base class that I was to associate information with on a pertype rather than perinstance basis.  Essentially I want all child classes to present an Icon and a FriendlyName that represents the type.  Id like to emnotem have to create a type instance to get this information and I want to require that all child classes provide this information.  Ideally it would be in the interface that the base derives from.p  pI tried to use a class Attribute, but it requires a constant value, so while I can set the FriendlyName, I cant set the Icon, and I cant see a way to make the Attribute required anyway, so child classes could get away with not having it until run time.p  pI added a static Property to the base that children can hide, but thats kind of ugly and the values from the base are really nonsensical.  It cant know what the name would be for a child.  I could have the base throw in the Property, but again, that wouldnt get caught until run time.p  pAnyone have any ideas on how I might implement something like this  Is there a pattern Im missing Any outofthebox thinking is encouraged as well.p  pstrongEditstrong Really what I need to the ability to require class Attributes along an inheritance tree and be able to use an embedded resource to set those attributes.

Negative 2904 pI always thought that a emlookbehindem assertion in Javas regexAPI and many other languages for that matter must have an obvious length.

Negative 2904 pbr  I have run into a problem... Im trying to use QTKit in an application that we have at work. The only problem with that is the app is written in C, not ObjC. I have looked through Apples documentation for answers, but I havent found anything useful. p  pBasically what Im looking to do is write a single controller class in ObjC that has its methods exposed through a C interface to my app. Ive written all that code already, but when I try and link it to even a sample C app, it finds the ObjC symbols in the lib and complains about them being there. I thought about hiding the symbols using compiler flags, but I saw in Apples docs that ObjC isnt affected by that, since classes and messages are bound by the runtime and not the linker.p  pHas anyone successfully done thisp  pThanks, Robbiep

The code itself is straightforward and similar to that in another Stackoverflow post a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions356464localizationofdisplaynameattributelink textap  pThe code works for global resources but not so well for local resources. I have a registration screen and used the Visual Studio Generate Local Resource command to create my local resource file. The generated file is named Registration.aspx.resx and the AppLocalResources folder is created relative to the actual Registration.aspx page  as one would expect.p  pHowever, when I attempt to get the localized string usingp  pcodeResourceManager.GetStringresourceKeycode p  pI receive the following error message.p  blockquote   pCould not find any resources   appropriate for the specified culture   or the neutral culture.  Make sure   FullAssemblyName.Views.Account.AppLocalResources.Registrationaspx.resources   was correctly embedded or linked into   assembly FullAssemblyName at compile   time, or that all the satellite   assemblies required are loadable and   fully signed.p blockquote  pUsing reflector, I can see that the file is actually Registration.aspx.resources and not Registrationaspx.resources  the underscoreperiod being the subtle differencep  blockquote   pFullAssemblyName.Views.Account.AppLocalResources.Registration.aspx.resourcesp blockquote  pI have toyed with the code quite a bit but no matter what I do, the file being requested is always different than that copiled in  the assembly.

Negative 2904 pI am building a very dynamic webbased application using a lot of Javascript to handle user events. I am in the process of making things a little more usable and came across a problem that Ive never had before.p  pI am using jQuery, so factor that in to your answers. Thanks in advance.p  pI have a set of button elements defined as p  precodeltinput typebutton titleMy useful text here. disableddisabled gt codepre  pI have these buttons with a default style ofp  precodedivoptionbuttons input       cursor help  codepre  pThen, using jQuery I run something like this as a clickevent on a select boxp  precodewindow.currentcolumn   select.reportoptioncolumns.liveclick, function      var column  this.val     if  column  window.currentcolumn            clear our our previous selections         window.currentcolumn            make this option no longer selected         this.val          divoptionbuttons input.attrdisabled,disabled         divoptionbuttons input.attr             title,             You must select a column from this list.                  divoptionbuttons input.csscursor, help      else          window.currentcolumn  column         divoptionbuttons input.attrdisabled,         divoptionbuttons input.attr             title,             Add this option for the column   column                    divoptionbuttons input.csscursor, default       codepre  pSo, as you can see, when a column is selected in the select box not shown here, I want the button to be enabled and behave like a button would with my own clickevents. But when a column is not selected including the default load, I want the button disabled. The usability developer in me wanted to give the users subtle contextual clues as to what they can do to enable the button through the native rendering of the title attribute as a lightweight tooltip. I do this already in other areas of the application this is a crazy beast of a project and our usability tests have shown that the users are at least capable of recognizing that when the cursor changes to help that they can hover over the element and get some information about what is going on.p  pBut this is the first time Ive ever tried this with a form element. Apparently when I put disableddisabled in the element, it completely ignores the title attribute and will never display the tool tip.p  pNow, I know I have a few options at least the ones I could think ofp  ol liWrite my own custom tool tip plugin that is a little bit more robust.li liDont disable the element, but style it as disabled. This was the option I was leaning on the most in terms of ease to develop but I hate having to do this.li liLeave the button as enabled but dont process the click event. I dont like this option as much because I like to leave things natively styled as they should logically be. A disabled button feels the most correct and the look of a disabled button is instantly recognizable as a disabled button.li ol  pSo, with all that said, am I missing something Is there something easy that I can do that I just havent thought of Google searches have failed me on this topic, so I thought Id toss this out on StackOverflow to get some fresh eyes on this.p  pstrongEditstrong p  pI just found another StackOverflow question on this same topic, though that person used a very different set of terms describing his problem probably why I didnt find it.p  pThe url to the question is a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2034820firefoxdoesnotshowtooltipsondisabledinputfieldshttpstackoverflow.comquestions2034820firefoxdoesnotshowtooltipsondisabledinputfieldsap  pBoth of the answers on that question are pretty good, though Id like to see if anyone has any other suggestions. Maybe something more jQuery specific Thanks again.p

Negative 2904 pFor many years I have used the old strongSAP DCOM Connectorstrong to communicate between Microsoft based applications and SAP. Unfortunately this old but good and performant technology is no longer supported by SAP since years. Therefore I want and must migrate to another newer technology.p  pFirst there is the strongSAP Connector for .NET 2.0strong. At first glance it seems to be a good replacement. But this connector can only used with .NET 1.1 with a workaround also with .NET 2.0 and there is no further development in the future. Shame on you SAP  SAP says, in the future we should use the strongEnterprise Services Explorerstrong for Visual Studio. But this technology is only available for ECC6.0 and not for 4.6C. And thats the point. I need a modern technology, which is available for 4.6C and ECC6.0  p  pSo I did some investigations and discovered the product strongERPConnectstrong from strongTheobaldSoftwarestrong. It looks really nice and they have a good and cheap license model. The first problem with this product is, that it is not allowed to give the source code of applications, which are based on ERPConnect, to the customer. Thats strange, because often customers also buy the rights for the application sources. The second problem is, that this product is not from SAP and is also not certified from SAP . Many customers dont want a product from a third party. p  pSo now my question is are there further possibilities to connect the strongMicrosoft Worldstrong with the strongSAP Worldstrong  and does somebody know alternatives to the above mentioned methods  Especially I need alternatives for using RFCs. p

And when your DVCS knows itself how to strongemfind common ancestoremstrong, you dont need to provide it as an argument, as for example in CVS.br .br Note that there might be more than one common ancestor of two or more commits. Git makes use of so called recursive merge strategy, which merges merge bases common ancestor, till you are left with one virtual  effective common ancestor in some simplification, and can the do simple 3way merge.  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers46058jakubnarebskiJakub Narbskias a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2613525whatmakesmergingindvcseasy2614937answerali olli ul  pCheck as well a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2471606howandorwhyismergingingitbetterthaninsvnHow andor why is merging in Git better than in SVNap

Negative 2904 pI am setting up an application using the MVC model and I have a query regrading the flow of information from the UI to the data model. What I need to do is place data from the UI in the model, what I have done is write a method in the view which collects the required data in an object and then passes it to the model. The model then takes ownership of the data so that the view can release its ownership. Does this sound sensiblep

Negative 2904 pI have n pages with formviews, all sharing a similar layout inside their itemeditinsert templates.p  pFor example all item and edit templates have a header and body part inside where i put the fields. The header has a certain style and the body part too.p  pMy question is how can i enforce this style in all my formviews without repeating the same bulk css styles all the time.p  pNow im using masterpages for this with multiple formviews on 1 page.  Thats not good i think. I want one 1 page for editinsertitem and 1 formview.p  pI would prefer somehow to define the style for edit template once and load it into every formview. Ofcourse not all the formviews have the same fields, so like masterpages i would like to have areas where i can put my fields.p  pThe perfect way i suppose would be to have a formview span a complete masterpage based page including the contentplaceholders inside its editinsertitem templates.p  pAny ideas are more than welcome.p  pEdit I read its possible in .Net 4 using dynamic data.

Negative 2904 pI searched all over place for an answer to this but couldnt find anything. Perhaps this is just a stupid question or a really tricky one. Here it isp  pLets say my model is this pseudo django codep  precodeEvent   type  ForeignKeyEventType   name  CharField   datestart  DateField   dateend  DateField  EventType   name  CharField codepre  pWhat I want to know is the average duration time for each event type. What I do now is calculate the average duration whenever a new event is created save method and have that stored in an averageduration column in EventType. The problem with this approach is that I cannot answer questions like what was the average duration time for events of type X, emduring the year Yem. So instead of adding more columns to answer questions like these I would prefer to have it done in realtime.p  pCan this be done by annotating the queryset First I would have to get the date differences for each event type, then come up with their average, and then annotate the Event queryset with that average, I assume.p

Negative 2904 pIm writing a .net WCF service.  Ive written a few classes that I want to return to the calling code from the WCF service hence, I decorate them with the codeDataContractcode attribute.p  pLets suppose that my WCF service is called codeFooServicecode.  It contains a method called codeFooMethodcode which returns an object of type codeFooDatacode which is decorated with the codeDataContractcode attribute.  Suppose that codeFooDatacode contains a list of numbers and a method called codeFooAveragecode which returns the average value of the numbers.p  pIn Visual Studio, I create a new application to consume the service.  I add a new Service Reference to my WCF Service and give it the namespace codemyWcfServicecode.  In my client code, I instantiate a proxy class and get a connection to the service.  To get the codeFooDatacode object from my proxy, the method call is codemyWcfService.FooMethodcode.  It returns an object of type codemyWcfService.FooDatacode, which is a type determined from the codeFooServicecode metadata.p  pNow that I have my object of type codemyWcfService.FooDatacode, how can I get this data into an object of type codeFooDatacode as the original type from the service code so that I can call codeFooData.FooAveragecodep  pbEditb I am entirely aware of the fact that data comes down the pipe in XML format and that the logic of the methods in a class decorated with codeDataContractcode does not get returned by the service it isnt serializable.  What Im asking is if I can reference the class that contains the codeDataContractcode class used in the service, is there a straightforward way to deserialize the data into the class that it was serialized fromp  pI am willing to accept the answer that it is not possible with the current .net framework.p

Negative 2904 pI am currently writing some unit tests for an ASP.NET MVC 2 controller and having some issues with the MVC 2.0 validation attributes.

Negative 2904 pstrongA little backgroundstrongp  pIm building an application which uses a plugin architecture to access specific devices. These devices have fields, which I named Attributes, that can be read, written or both. This is done using a WPF frontend running in its own thread and a MVVM like structure in the back end which wraps specific plugin to expose its attributes in a generic way.p  pstrongSome details about the threading structurestrongp  pI have two host objects, one initiates the plugin structures eventually exposes two views a view of available plug ins and if a plugin was selected a view of all attributes known by a single plugin. The other eventually starts a STAthread and runs the a main window in a WPF application. The second host uses BackgroundWorkers to do select, initialization, update and submit tasks. The DoWork eventsdelegatesI believe they are called delegates are defined in a ViewController class which is in the MVVM structure and provides a functional interface for updating etc. and implements the INotifyPropertyChanged interface.p  pstrongSome more detailsstrongp  pUpon creation of the mainwindow its context is set to the view controller object. The GUI then binds two list boxes to both views.p  pstrongThe problemstrongp  pWhen I call the selectPlugin method from within the UI thread it freezes until the connect operation is complete and every single attribute is loaded into the list contained by the ViewModel. However it does work and afterwards the ListBox itemssource binding is updated and all attributes are shown.p  pHowever I dont want the UI to freeze up on every operation, so I implemented backgroundworkers. It all works fine, the objects get updated and the binding source is replaced by a new View instance. But the binding itself doesnt update.p  pI tried allot off different solutions using the Dispatcher.Invoke or the DoWorkComplete event in the UI thread. I found that the PropertyChanged event itself stays null using the following property setterp  precode    public IAttributesViewModel AttributesView              get                           StaticLogger.WriteDebugLoglog,                                            String.FormatExecuting 0,                                                          System.Reflection.MethodBase.GetCurrentMethod                 return currentAttributes                  set                       currentAttributes  value             OnPropertyChangedAttributesView               codepre  pThe implementation of INotifyPropertyChanged looks like thisp  precode    region INotifyPropertyChange implementation      ltsummarygt      Occurs when a property value changes.      ltsummarygt     public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged      ltsummarygt      Called when [property changed].      ltsummarygt      ltparam namenamegtThe name.ltparamgt     protected void OnPropertyChangedstring name              StaticLogger.WriteDebugLoglog, String.FormatExecuting 0, System.Reflection.MethodBase.GetCurrentMethod         var handler  PropertyChanged         if handler  null                      handlerthis, new PropertyChangedEventArgsname                   endregion codepre  pThe PropertyChanged event as declared above is always null. This could or should have something to do with the actual binding in XAML, however i did set de datacontext of the main window in the UI thread like thisp  precode    private static void Hostobject viewControler              var controler  viewControler as IViewController         instance.main  new MainWindowcontroler  DataContext  controler          var gui  new App         if instance.main  null throw new ArgumentNullExceptionviewControler         gui.Runinstance.main      codepre  pI use a Singleton instance off the UI host object, in case that makes a difference.p  pIn XAML I use a custom dependency property on a UserControll containing the AttributesListbox and some styling code. The actual ListBox binds to this property for its own ItemSource property. Dont think this should be different from using the list box directly, but just in case this causes the issue with the PropertyChanged event being null, and is implemented in the following wayp  pstrongCstrong            Interaction logic for AttributesListBox.xaml           public partial class AttributesListBox  UserControl              private static readonly UIPropertyMetadata sourceMetadata  new UIPropertyMetadataString.Empty,              SourceChangedCallbackp  precode    public AttributesListBox              InitializeComponent            ltsummarygt      The dependency property that gets or sets the source of the ListBox to render.      ltsummarygt     public static DependencyProperty sourceProperty  DependencyProperty.Register         Source, typeofIEnumerable, typeofAttributesListBox,sourceMetadata      ltsummarygt      Gets or sets the nsource of the image to render.      ltsummarygt     public IEnumerable Source              get  return IEnumerableGetValuesourceProperty          set  SetValuesourceProperty, value            private static void SourceChangedCallbackDependencyObject d, DependencyPropertyChangedEventArgs e              var box  AttributesListBox d         box.List.ItemsSource  e.NewValue as IEnumerable       codepre  pstrongXAMLstrongp  precodeltListBox NameList VerticalAlignmentStretch HorizontalAlignmentStretch ItemsSourceBinding Source BorderBrushxNull gt codepre  pstrongThe first questionsstrongp  pWhat is wrong with the way I use the ViewController object in conjunction with the UI And thus why is the PropertyChanged event always null This should mean I messed up the binding process somewhere doesnt itp  pstrongThe second questionsstrongp  pHow do I get the OnPropertyChanged event to notify the UI thread, specificity the Binding in the UserControllAttributesListbox p  pWhat route does the event follow p  pfor instance I use a DoWork delegate and this method changes the property directly from within the instance, which is not in the UI thread. Does this cause the event never to reach the UI thread because is it raised in the other worker threadp  pI cant get my head around the event bubblingtunnelling, is a event restricted to the thread which created the instance or the thread which called the specific methodusing a dispatcher or whateverp  pstrongHypothesisstrongp  pI suspect there are two issues in my case 1. The PropertyChanged handler stays null because the object is either not bound or because it is not created in the correct thread. 2. The event, if it where actually fired, never reaches the correct thread because it gets stuck in either the BackgroundWorker thread or the back end host thread.p  pemThis is the first question I have asked here, so if your missing some pieces off the puzzle please do inform me.emp  pThanks for taking the time to read about my little problem situation, I hope we can come to a solution.p

Negative 2904 pEssentially what I am liking to do here is make a templated function call where the caller essentially requests a given type and either a pointer or a reference will be passed back.

Negative 2904 pIm trying to implement Comet XHR Streaming with Node.js. Since, XHR Streaming make client side XHR.responseText keep growing, it is necessary that client side close current XHR and restart XHR Streaming again.p  pIn server side, for each XHR streaming, the http.ServerResponse object should be held until the HTTP session is over.p  pThe problem is How can Node.js detect browser side has ended one HTTP sessionp  pI thought, ideally, there is one callback argument to http.ServerResponse.write. So that writing to a closed HTTP session would trigger the callback and let us know it is aborted. But, there is no such callback argument.p

Negative 2904 pExample RSS feed link a hrefhttptwitter.comstatusesusertimelinetwitter.rss relnofollowhttptwitter.comstatusesusertimelinetwitter.rssap  pDoes anyone know if Twitter limits calls to a public RSS feed This is not using an API but a simple call to a URL. p  pI am unable to find anything official or even speculative. I know the API has access limits of x requests within y minutes. I am wondering if the public RSS feeds follow a similar pattern. I am seeing behavior in a mobile app that makes me think that this may be the case.p  pDevice 1 receives an empty response while device 2 still gets updates for identical feed. Have also seen it on from my computer running a simulator for a while. Simulator stopped getting updates, then I couldnt pull up the feed in a web browser on same machine that was running the simulator. I am suspicious that Twitter is limiting RSS feed access by device. I think this because in the previous example, all RSS feeds were inaccessible form the web browser while the Twitter site was functioning properly in the same web browser.p  pThe RSS URL is being queried every 10 minutes.p  pAny insight is appreciated.p

Negative 2904 pGood day to everyone. Im here today to seek help about Flash CS4 and ActionScript 3.0. The story starts when one day, my boss asked me to make a flash presentation about their upcoming user training for a newly developed software. I was enthusiastic and excited about it because its been a long time that I did not use Flash note that I dont have any experience in ActionScript 3.0. At first, everything was a bit rough as I need to recall how to properly use the frames to create a successful animation. As I was about to finish the project, my boss approached me again and asked if I could insert a menu page in front so that the users wont have to replay the whole thing again just to look for a little something on that part of the movie. So yea, at first I was abit hesitant to accept. I said that it will work with Powerpoint. But shes a total pusher and I was forced to say yes. Now Im having this problem about how to make a flash button load a swf movie. Ive tried searching all over the net for tutorials but most of the times the getUrl and other stuff are said to be outdated. Help pleasep

These FK relationships are all included in the linq query so we have a complete object graph.p  pThe views in the client use previously fetched entities for static data such as lookup tables for performance.  If we have say a Customer object with a FK to User this will be loaded when retrieved from the service.  If we now add another entity to the object graph e.g. Order and set a User property on this object which has the same Id as in the Customer object but the entity was retrieved at a different point and therefore using a different ObjectContext i.e. the objects have the same Id but are not the same instance of the object I get this error.p  pThe link to the other question demonstrates ways to avoid this but I am looking to find more information about which entities are causing the problem so I can track down the error.p

Negative 2904 pI have a customer that has the following data structure... for each patient, there may be multiple samples, and each sample may, after processing, have 4 million data objects.  The max number of samples per patient is 20.  So a single patient may end up with 80 million rows of data, and of course there will be many many hundreds of patients eventually.p  pIn setting up a database to store the objects which each contain about 30 fields of statistics and measurements the challenge is pretty clear how to manage this vast amount of datap  pI was thinking that I would have one database, with a table for each sample so each table may have at most 4 million records.p  pA colleague of mine had an interesting suggestion which was to take it one step further create a new database per patient and then have a table per sample.  His thinking was that having 1 log per patient, being able to move databases on a per patient basis, etc was good.

Negative 2904 pI wrote a .NET 4.0 web service that sends back data from an applications data storage.  Basically, it is accessing remote, structured text files.  The request for data would take between 1014 seconds on average.  Within the last 34 weeks, the server is now taking about 4 minutes to access that same data.  In an attempt to remove the network as an issue, I moved the files I was accessing to the IIS 6.0 server on Windows 2003 and it is still taking about 4 minutes to return data.p  pI have a .NET 4.0 web service making calls to COBOL access code that accesses the data files.  None of the access code nor the files have been changed.p  pThe problem appears to be the IIS server.  I can run this web service from my developer work station to access the files at the remote application server, it runs within the 1014.p  pPerformance The web service isnt going beyond 50 utilization processorwise.  I havent looked that closely at the disks, but the server sits idle most of the time.p  pIm looking for suggestions on figuring out where to start troubleshooting from. p  pThanks, Martinp

The menu is working just fine, how ever, printing it isnt. Problem is, Im using recursive method to print out all the submenus, but it keeps on printing the very first menu over and over again.

Theres always a subMenu, even if there wasnt, since the menu self doesnt find a submenu, it checks for its metatable, which has subMenu, and then on line 11, it does the for loop for its metatables submenus. Which means, itll draw itself again. And again. And again. So is there a way to bypass a metatable, in just one place Or am I even right, is the repeated printing caused by thatp

Negative 2904 pI would like to implement word boundary matches within a DFA based regular expression matcher.  Can someone tell me how this is donep  pTo give some background, Im currently using the dk.brics.automaton library, but it does not support assertions e.g. codebcode, word boundary.  I need to use a DFA based engine because my main goal is actually determining equivalence of regular expressions, not doing the actual matching.p  pAdditionally, the answer to the following question seems to indicate this is possible a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1217189dfabasedregularexpressionmatchinghowtogetallmatchesDFA based regular expression matching  how to get all matchesa by sayingp  blockquote   pAgain, we manage this by adding an epsilon transition with special instructions to the simulator. If the assertion passes, then the state pointer continues, otherwise it is discarded.p blockquote  pI cant quite figure out what this means, however.  Is it suggesting that it can only be done with a special type of epsilon transition that looks at its endpoints and can only be traversed if its endpoint meet the assertion, or can it be done with normal epsilon transitions configured in some way  If I need these special type of epsilon transitions, then how can these be determinized i.e. converted to a standard DFAp  pPointers to any descriptions of how to actually implement this are greatly appreciated.p

Negative 2904 pI have a pretty large codeCAShapeLayercode that Im rendering. The layer is completely static, but its contained in a codeUIScrollViewcode so it can move around and be zoomed  basically, it must be redrawn every now and then. In an attempt to improve the framerate of this scrolling, I set codeshouldRasterize  YEScode on the layer, which worked perfectly. Because I never change any property of the layer it never has a rasterization miss and I get a solid 60 fps. High fives all around, rightp  pUntil the layer gets a little bigger. Eventually  and it doesnt take long  the rasterized image gets too large for the GPU to handle. According to my console, codeltNoticegt CoreAnimation surface 2560 x 4288 is too largecode, and it just doesnt draw anything on the screen.

Is there an easy way to do this Can I create a new layer that renders a rectangular area from another layer Or is there some other solution I should explorep  h2Edith2  pCreating a tiled composite seems to have really bad performance because the layers are rerasterized every time they enter the screen, creating for a very jerky scrolling experience.

Create multiple tile layers using subrectangles from that image, and actually put those on the screen.p  precode CALayer getTiledLayerFromLayerCALayer sourceLayer withHorizontalTilesinthorizontalTiles verticalTilesintverticalTiles      CALayer containerLayer  [CALayer layer]     CGFloat tileWidth  sourceLayer.bounds.size.width  horizontalTiles     CGFloat tileHeight  sourceLayer.bounds.size.height  verticalTiles       make sure these are integral, otherwise youll have image alignment issues     NSLogtileWidthf heightf, tileWidth, tileHeight      UIGraphicsBeginImageContextWithOptionssourceLayer.bounds.size, NO, 0     CGContextRef tileContext  UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext     [sourceLayer renderInContexttileContext]     CGImageRef image  CGBitmapContextCreateImagetileContext     UIGraphicsEndImageContext      forint horizontalIndex  0 horizontalIndex lt horizontalTiles horizontalIndex          forint verticalIndex  0 verticalIndex lt verticalTiles verticalIndex              CGRect frame  CGRectMakehorizontalIndex  tileWidth, verticalIndex  tileHeight, tileWidth, tileHeight             CGRect visibleRect  CGRectMakehorizontalIndex  CGFloathorizontalTiles, verticalIndex  CGFloatverticalTiles, 1.0f  horizontalTiles, 1.0f  verticalTiles             CALayer tile  [CALayer layer]             tile.frame  frame             tile.contents  bridge idimage             tile.contentsRect  visibleRect             [containerLayer addSublayertile]                    CGImageReleaseimage      return containerLayer  codepre  pThis works great...sort of. One the one hand, I get 60fps panning and zooming of a code1980 x 3330code layer on a retina iPad. On the other hand, it takes 20 seconds to start up So while this solution solves my original problem, it gives me a new one how can I generate the tiles fasterp  pLiterally all of the time is spent in the code[sourceLayer renderInContexttileContext]code call. This seems weird to me, because if I just add that layer directly I can render it about 40 times per second, according to the Core Animation Instrument. Is it possible that creating my own image context causes it to not use the GPU or somethingp

While the view of your modally presented view controller is transparent, there is nothing underneath it except the app window, which is black.  iOS 7 introduced a new modal presentation style, codeUIModalPresentationCustomcode, that causes iOS not to remove the views underneath the presented view controller. However, in order to use this modal presentation style, you must provide your own transition delegate to handle the presentation and dismiss animations.

Negative 2904 pIm trying to find a method to take a URIURL string from a user and determine a working, canonical form or failing if the resource isnt valid. Simultaneously, it should also verify that the URL exists. So were checking for both valid syntax and also existence.p  pFor instance, a string like codegoogle.comcode should be turned into codehttpwww.google.comcode, and a string like codegoogle.cominsightscode should be turned into codehttpwww.google.cominsightscode. A string like codehttpthiswebsitedoesntexistatall.comcode should return some sort of error or exception.p  pI believe a portion of the solution may likely be calling an HTTP codegetresponsecode method and following redirects until I get a code200 OKcode status.p  pIt seems like the codeURI.parsecode method is not forgiving of leaving off the codehttpcode. I realize I could write a simple thing to try adding codehttpcode in front, etc., but I was hoping there was some existing gem or littleknown library function that would be really forgiving about URLs and canonicalize them for me.p  pBoth the built in codenethttpcode and codeHTTPartycode seem to be too strict for what Im looking for.

Negative 2904 pI am beginner for HBase. I am currently not sure what influences HBase performance.  First, I ran Hbase in a stand alone mode. I used a single machine to run a Mapreduce program to process 2 million text lines and output the results to a HBase table stored in local file system. it took about 1h40min. Then I changed to the pseudo distributed mode. Htable file is then stored in HDFS.All other things including program remain the same. Then it took more than 3 hours I am totally confused. Can anyone tell me why this happanedp  pAnother question, since I create 5 virtual machines as the virtual cluster on a Linux machine which is not very powerful8G ram. 3GHz 4 core CPU. When I ran Mapreduce program month ago, I saw no big difference when I ran it on a single master or with 5 more slaves. So I assumed that the CPU might be the bottleneck but still I am not sure. Can anyone give answers for sure since I am not much familiar with Operating System I am not sure whether its a IO bottleneck or CPU bottleneck. And I just run the program on the 6 machines cluster for inserting records into HBase table on a  fully distributed mode. It was too slow so I killed the job. p

Negative 2904 pMy question is similar to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10762133changingsensorcoordinatesysteminandroidChanging sensor coordinate system in androidap  pI want to be able to compare a users movements with each other regardless of device orientation. So that when the users holds out the phone in portrait orientation and bends his arm, acceleration readings are the same as when he holds out his phone in landscape and then bends his arm in the same direction.p  pThis is what I call the user coordinate system. It is different from the world coordinate system since it should not matter what wind direction the user is facing. It is different from device coordinates since it should not matter how the user holds his device.p  pIt is acceptable in my application to do a calibration step before each movement so the baseresting orientation matrices can be determined. Is it perhaps just a matter of multiplying the matrix of the first movement with the inverse of the second and then with the new valuesp  pThe answer in the question mentioned seems about right, but I need a more concrete explanation, actual code samples would be ideal.p  pNote remapCoordinateSystem wont suffice, it only accepts right angles. I need to be able to work with small deviations since the device is strapped to a wrist, which might not always be at right angles with the arm.p

Negative 2904 pIm working on a push architecture that needs to support applications which allow for multiple users. This means more than one user can log into the application with their credentials. The problem Im running into is what if user A allows push notifications, then logs out, then user B logs in and starts getting user As push notificationsp  pWhat are some best practices for handling this type of thing One thought I had was you could remember the last user who logged in and only display push notifications to the logged in user. You would have to send some sort of user context in the message payload so it could be checked against the logged in user. However this feels a little funky. p  pAnyone else ran into this Its seems like a really relevant problem, especially for tablets where families tend to share the device. p

If it is strongWorkerstrong object user must enter ID and hoursworked. If it is a strongMachineWorkerstrong object user must enter ID,hoursWorked and pieces. Once these values read search through the array to locate the object with the given ID before calling the strongaddWeeklystrong.The number of arguments either1 or 2 to be passed to strongaddWeeklystrong depends on the type of objects being referred.

Negative 2904 pIs it possible for a visitor to a page to run an arbitrary function specified in the javascript for that page from their browserp  pFor a simple example, if the page has a function to hide a particular element when a button is clicked, can a visitor trigger that function and hide the element without clicking the button, but by calling the function directly somehowp

Negative 2904 pI have a ListView control and 2 ObjectDataSources. By default the ListView is not linked to the ObjectDataSources through the DataSourceID property. So that when the page loads, I have nothing displayed.p  pDepending on what button gets clicked on the page, I programmatically attach the ListView to one ObjectDataSource, or the other. I can switch back and forth between the ObjectDataSources and it works fine.p  pBut there is also a button to detach the ListView from the ObjectDataSource entirely.

Negative 2904 pMy problem, i create one Class A which updates and handles values.

Negative 2904 pWe have requirement to develop server side push infra for real time web applications. For this, I have been considering using Cometd since this supports both long polling as well as web sockets based implementation. p  pHowever, I recently came across links like a hrefhttpactivemq.apache.orgajax.html relnofollowhttpactivemq.apache.orgajax.htmla and a hrefhttpactivemq.apache.orgwebsockets.html relnofollowhttpactivemq.apache.orgwebsockets.htmla that say even ActiveMQ provides support for server side push using long pollingComet technique as well as web sockets. My understanding is that ActiveMQ implementation for this does not conform to Bayeux protocol. p  pIs there any advantagebenefits of ActiveMQ over the Cometd for server side push solutions Are there any additional features that one of these provide Which is these is more popular and stable p  pThanks, Deepakp

Ive already triedp  ol lipZendControllerRouterRoute with Chains, in the config .ini file, but since both the controller and the action have to be specified, when accessing a hrefhttpapi.example.comprofessorsprofessorIdsubjects relnofollowhttpapi.example.comprofessorsprofessorIdsubjectsa it always pointed to the same action i.e., whatever the call method was  POST, PUT, GET, DELETE  it always pointed to the action specified in the config .ini file. For example, had I specified the getAction in the config file, using chains it would always call the getAction, no matter what was the method Ive used. Currently, when having a POST call, it actually calls the postAction similarly happens for PUT, GET, DELETE, PATCH, HEAD and OPTIONS. My Controller file looks like thisp  precodeclass V1ProfessorsController extends RESTController          public function optionsAction                           code goes here                   public function headAction                           code goes here                   public function indexAction                           code goes here  list of resources                   public function getAction                           code goes here                   public function postAction                           code goes here                   public function putAction                           code goes here                   public function patchAction                           code goes here                   public function deleteAction                           code goes here            codepreli lipSubclassing the ZendRestRoute and overriding the match function as pointed out a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma94741711988372herea. The thing is, that while this does work when calling codehttpapi.example.comprofessorsprofessorIdsubjectscode, it still uses the same ProfessorsController that is used when calling codehttpapi.example.comprofessorscode. Im not sure about this, but I believe that it would be best having its own controller e.g. ProfessorsSubjectsController.pli ol  pAlso, Ive got a question. How should the hierarchical routes work Would it be better to have different controllers for different resourcessubresources E.g., having ProfessorsController for codehttpapi.example.comprofessorsprofessorIdcode and ProfessorsSubjectsController for codehttpapi.example.comprofessorsprofessorIdsubjectssubjectIdcode p

Negative 2904 pFirstly I am not asking the same question as a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5450353csharpalternativetothreadsleepthisa, or a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9118414alternativetothreadsleepincthata. I dont think I am using it incorrectly and need a genuine alternative for specific situations.p  pDuring a code analysis run I saw a surprising violation coming up p  blockquote   pUsage of Thread.Sleep is a sign of flawed design.p blockquote  pThis violation leads to Peter Richies article on why exactly this constitutes bad design a hrefhttpmsmvps.comblogspeterritchiearchive20070426threadsleepisasignofapoorlydesignedprogram.aspxhttpmsmvps.comblogspeterritchiearchive20070426threadsleepisasignofapoorlydesignedprogram.aspxap  pWe all know thread creation is expensive and blocking in threads means contention on the pool. We also know that each thread will allocate a meg of memory so it should have a short lifespan, blocking on the UI is evil, using sleep for timing is unreliable etc etc etc. Which leads me to my point, if you really need to perform a sleep, what should you be using if not Thread.Sleepp  pPeter goes on to mention that a zero sleep is the only correct use of Thread.Sleep effectively giving up the threads timeslice and allowing other threads to process. And then even more scary is that this is only a because of limitations on unmanaged threads and if reimplemented in the CLR will create side effects of using Thread.Sleep in your applications. All the points on common bad usage are, in fact, good examples of bad usage.p  pI have the following situations in production code that uses Thread.Sleep quite successfullyp  ul liWaiting for a file lock to be relinquished by the operating system catch file lock problems, strongwait for a secondstrong, try again, give up after a while.li liKilling a process and waiting for it not to show up in the process list kill it, check its not running, strongwait for a secondstrong, check it not still running, force it closed.li liWaiting for copy buffers to flush check a file size, try to access it, strongwaitstrong, check if size has changed.li ul  pWithout using Thread.Sleep in situations like these, what other options do I have Tight loops tend to make things worse and I dont believe this makes its usage a design flaw especially since nothing is on the UI and only in background threads. It is just the nature of software to wait for other things in a multithreaded environment with external factors affecting your code, sometimes you need to wait...p

Negative 2904 pI had an issue recently where I called an asynctask from an activity and returned some data. My UI would freeze up and I was getting an ANR. I seemed to have resolved it by using a combination of solutions for both things I thought it could be, both the asynctask and the arraylist I was implementing. p  pI had a callback on the asynctask to load the data asynchronously. I guessed, though I had a hard time figuring out, that the asynctask was being retained after onpostexecute In any case, I called this.cancel in onpostexecute. p  pAfter reading up a bit on it, it seems that the cancel function on schedules the task to be cancelled and that it can possibly persist after the request is made. So I must ask is there a better way to cancel the asynctask after you are finished with it Will cancel be sufficient in most cases Are there ways to avoid having to call cancel at all while implementing a call back. p

Negative 2904 h2Backgroundh2  pI am storing table rows as MongoDb documents, with each column having a name. Lets say table has these columns of interest codeIdentifiercode, codePersoncode, codeDatecode, codeCountcode. The MongoDb document also has some extra fields separate from the table data, represented by codetimestampcode. Columns are not fixed which is why I use schemafree database to store them in the first place.p  pThere will be need to do various complex, but so far unspecified queries. I am not very concerned about performance, though query performance may conceivably become a bottleneck. Once inserted, documents will not be modifed a new document with same codeIdentifiercode will be created instead, and insertions are not very frequent lets say, 1000 new MongoDb documents per day. So amount of data will steadily grow over time.p  h2Exampleh2  pThe straightforward approach is having a collection of MongoDb documents likep  precode    id XXXX,    insertDate ISODate20121015T212617Z,    flag true,    data         Identifier AB002,        Person John002,        Date ISODate20131116T212617Z,        Count 1      codepre  pNow I have seen an alternative approach for example in accepted answer of a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15268063mongoqueryonsubfieldsthis questiona, using array with two fields per objectp  precode    id XXXX,    insertDate ISODate20121015T212617Z,    flag true,    data [         field Identifier, value AB002 ,         field Person, value John001 ,         field Date, value ISODate20131116T212617Z ,         field Count, value 1     ]  codepre  h2Questionsh2  pDoes the 2nd approach make any sense at allp  pIf yes, then how to choose which to use Especially, are there some specific kinds of queries which are easycheap with one approach, hardcostly with another Any rules of thumb on which way to go, or procon lists for both Example reallife cases of one aproach being inconvenient would be especially valuable.p

Negative 2904 pI have a very strange bug going on that I cant seem to figure out. Throughout my app in iOS 7 the navigation bar looks exactly how I want it to gradient background, sits below the status bar. But, when a video or MFMailComposeViewController is presented modally, then subsequently dismissed, the navigationbar for that view stack reverts back to the iOS 7 way of sitting behind the status bar, and there is an extra bar underneath.

Negative 2904 pThe filter code snippet below does something very simple. If a top level SVG group is tagged with a label contained in a matchlist, its visibility is enforced lt g styledisplay and the group, as well as non grouped code, is copied emas isem to standard output flush. Else, the group is removed from the stream purge.br The question is this As I understand it, each whole group which may be large is parsed in turn and stored in memory, which is not necessary as only the start tag is examined and modified. What would be the code modifications to stop reading the file after the start tag and then to fly down to the matching lt g end tag, copying the traversed code or not, without parsing anything than the nesting of tagsbr I read that starttaghandler is supposed to do that, but I couldnt manage to use flush or purge correctly.

Negative 2904 pIm using a AFHTTPSessionManager subclass as a Singleton, like most tutorials recommend to do.  But Im coding also in that singleton absolutely ALL the app requests from login to fetching users details and posting to walls etc.. everything using blocks, so methods can be called from other locations in the app using this singleton.p  pSo my client .m file is getting very big. Im doing this just to keep using the same AF Client singleton all across the app.p  pI was thinking, each model class should have its own networking methods. Ex. User class should have its own methods to update name, birthday, etc.. but then what happened to the singleton p  pSo whats the best practice to use a singleton or to have requests be managed by each model classp

Negative 2904 pThere is a maze of size NM, consisting of unit blocks. At the start Alice has K percentage of energy. Now Alice start from 1 st row and move towards N th row. From the present block she can move to a block in the next row, which is either on right or on left side of the present block. On moving to a block in i th row j th column, her energy  will reduce by Ci,j percent if Ci,j is greater then 0, else it will be recharged by Ci,j percent.p  pFor Example if she has 50 percent of energy, on moving to block with Ci,j  15, she will have 35  50 15  percent of the it remaining.p  pNow the task is to find out the status of the Alice energy in the end, if she moves optimally to save maximum energy. p  pNote  Her energy will not exceed more than 100 percent, and she will not move further if her energy goes down to 0 percent .p  pEXAMPLE  Let us suppose a grid of 44 as follow  p  p2 2 2 2p  p2 2 2 2p  p1 1 1 1p  p1 1 1 1p  pAnd if K 10 meaning she has 10 percent energy at start. then after reaching 4th row she will be having 16 percent energy.One of the optimal move will be lt1,2  lt2,1  lt3,2  lt4,1p  pSo here answer is 16.p

I want to have the ability to modify the input field and post to a txt file. But just for now, I cant seem to get how to use one query and in the html code separate from what is a column name and what is a value. That seems intensive logic going on, there has to be a simpler way of doing it. Could I use a variable from the first query that is inputted into a second query statement that retrieves this value and appears in an input form I do not know how to integrate this. Any help would be most appreciated. My php and html code is posted below. You will see that queryAlarms and queryAlarmsL is practically the same. This is where I am unsure as to what is more efficient using one query or two.

Negative 2904 pI have eleven tables.p  pCall one of them the Parent table, and the other ten are Child tables, perhaps ChildA, ChildB, etc through ChildJp  pConsider the Parent table to be abstracting a piece of electronics. Every piece of electronics has some common columns, like a name, but each different type of electronic device has widely differing properties. The columns needed to represent a TV are greatly different than, say, a cell phone.p  pThe parent may have one and only one child that exists in one of the Child tables, but will not be associated with more than one.p  pErgo, if Parent has a ChildA, it wont have a ChildB through ChildJ.p  pThe way that I have currently implemented this is through one ChildType column, one ChildId field, and ten persisted computed columns.p  pFor example, I assign arbitrarily the value 1 for the ChildType of ChildA, 2 for ChildB, etc. there is a CHECK constraint on ChildTypep  pI then create persisted columns using CASE to give the Parent table a ChildAId, ChildBId, etc by using the Type column.  p  pthat is, p  precodeChildAId AS CASE WHEN ChildType1 THEN ItemId END PERSISTED, ChildBId AS CASE WHEN ChildType2 THEN ItemId END PERSISTED, codepre  p.... etcp  pThese computed columns are persisted, as I need to use them in codeFOREIGN KEYcode constraints.p  pThe contents of the various Child tables are so different as to be completely unrelated to one another.p  pIn this way, I have effectively managed to represent a variant type in SQLp  pOther ideas I had considered, and why I rejected themp  ol lipUse the Id of the Parent table in the ChildX tables. Rejected because it allows more than one Child per Parent.pli lipxref tables between Parent and the various ChildX tables. Rejected because it, too, would allow multiple children per parent and more importantly, multiple parents per childpli lipCreate a bunch of columns that represent a superset of all of the data needed for all of the child types. rejected because it is stupid also, this is what the system I am in the process of replacing did, and one of the things I am trying to avoidpli ol  pNow to the actual questionp  pWhile this was a great idea when there were only 2 types of children, I started to get worried when it suddenly jumped up to 10. While this will likely not get as high as 50, it might get up to 25 different child types before were done.p  pAlso, this works really well when brought down into C through entity frameworkp  pEffectively a Parent row associatd with a ChildA row becomes a Parent object. It is a beautiful thing really, and one of the main reasons I picked what I picked.p  pIs there a more standardized way that data of this type basically a variant gets represented in SQL in a way that is controlled through constraints and allows me to query it and consume it with things like entity framework  Is the addition of many fields all but one of which will always be NULL the tradeoff cost of how Im doing this  Am I not seeing a red flag that I should be seeingp

Negative 2904 pBefore I elaborate on the problem, I should let you know that Ive successfully installed ffmpegthumbnailer on herokus bash heroku run bash.p  pIm trying to build ffmpegthumbnailer using a custom Heroku buildpack Ive written, but when I run .configure ampamp make install in the bincompile buildpack file, ffmpegthumbnailer tells me that it cant find the ffmpeg libs util, format, codec, scale and suggest that I set the PKGCONFIGPATH. So I set the PKGCONFIGPATH and it still cant seem to find the libraries.p  pIve tried setting the PKGCONFIGPATH every which way. echo export, export, directly set it via PKGCONFIGPATHapp... Ive always set it inline with the .configure command. I even set PKGCONFIGPATH as a heroku config var, and tried to acces it via the ENVDIR variable thats passed into the buildpack as the third parameter, but I soon realized that I was simply setting a variable PKGCONFIGPATH to the contents of the file called PKGCONFIGPATH, i.e. I was setting PKGCONFIGPATHappvendor..., which Ive already done None of these have worked. Also, as you can see in the compile file and the log, echo PKGCONFIGPATH prints the correct path.p  pWhat more debugging can i do What is going onp  pBelow is my bincompile buildpack file, and the log after I deploy my app to heroku.p  precodebinsh  indent    sed u s          echo gt Install ffmpegthumbnailer BUILDDIR1 VENDORDIRvendor DOWNLOADURLhttpsffmpegthumbnailer.googlecode.comfilesffmpegthumbnailer2.0.8.tar.gz  echo DOWNLOADURL   DOWNLOADURL  indent  cd BUILDDIR mkdir p VENDORDIR cd VENDORDIR curl L silent DOWNLOADURL  tar xz cd ffmpegthumbnailer2.0.8 export PKGCONFIGPATHPKGCONFIGPATHappvendorffmpeglibpkgconfig echo PKGCONFIGPATH .configure prefix appvendorffmpegthumbnailer ampamp make install  echo exporting PATH and LIBRARYPATH  indent PROFILEPATHBUILDDIR.profile.dffmpegthumbnailer.sh mkdir p dirname PROFILEPATH echo export PATHPATHvendorffmpegthumbnailerbin gtgt PROFILEPATH echo export LDLIBRARYPATHLDLIBRARYPATHvendorffmpegthumbnailerlib gtgt PROFILEPATH codepre  pAnd my heroku deployment log...p  precodeFetching repository, done.

Negative 2904 pIve inherited a simple small business network which has a single SBS 2003 server running Exchange. Its currently set up so that the domain name codemail.company.comcode maps to the server IP, so email can be accessed outside the network.p  pI dont want to mess with the SBS 2003 setup too much, however, I would like for them to be able to host codeintranet.company.comcode on the same IP, but mapped to a machine running their Apachebased intranet site so that road warriers can access it too it would basically become a public website.p  pWe have a single static IP address, an allinone firewallgatewayrouter and a single Windows SBS 2003 server with DNS and DHCP. The Apache machine is just a Windows 7 box on the network.p  pAssuming applicationlevel security is as good as it will be for now, so that turning their intranet application into a website application has minimal risk for them, what should I be looking at to actually make it work Thanksp  pOriginally posted on ServerFault, but more relevant herep  pPS I should say that SBS 2003 runs IIS 6.0 and I know that if the Apache machine was listening on port 80 instead of the SBS machine, it would be easy to setup up using virtual hosts.p

Negative 2904 pKinect Fusion requires the client code to specify what is effectively a boundingbox and voxel resolution within the box before initialisation. The details of the reconstruction within the box are held in GPU memory, and therefore one runs into limits rather quickly. Certainly for a space the size of, say, a standard residential house at high resolution the amount of GPU memory required is way too high.p  pThe Fusion SDK allows one to copy the data tofrom GPU memory, and to reset the bounding volume, resolution etc at any time, so in theory one could synthesise a large volume by stitching together a number of small volumes, each of which a normal GPU can handle. It seems to me to be a technique with quite a few subtle and difficult problems associated with it though. p  pNevertheless this seems to have been done with a hrefhttpswww.youtube.comwatchvD3yYjaLmiqU relnofollowkintinuousa.

Negative 2904 pI am writing a tool which is written in python and C. The python script reads a configuration file, performs some validation makes several calls to the C program.p  psystem RHE 5.7, python 2.7.6, gcc 4.5.2p  pSome of the parameters to the called C program are the paths of input files. There is one case where the input file path is the same for several C program invocations. In this case only the first call succeeds, and the returncode from the python subprocess module is 11.p  pI am not sure how to progress this. For a start, I cannot find documentation indicating what 11 might mean as an exit status. It does not appear to be in the standard codes in usrincludesysexits.h. I am guessing that the code could also be interpreted as 0xf5 or 245, since exit codes are I believe really signed 8bit values.p  pI have added debug to the start of the C program to print out the arguments it was called with, but nothing appears for the failed invocations. I can understand how the C might fail reopening a file which was read on the previous invocation perhaps, but the code doesnt even get that farp  pSo, where is the exit code coming from Is it from the bash environment which the python subprocess module presumably uses to invoke the C program Is it from the C runtime for the C program before it even reaches mainp  pI suppose I could progress this by moving the loop down into the C, so that it only gets called once for each input file path, but that still does not explain this behaviour.

Negative 2904 pThis is probably a noob question, but Im trying to hideshow a popup video based on the associated thumbnail a sibling div to the popup div because for the site we want to be able to have multiple popup videos for some pages without coming up with unique idsclasses for every thumbnailpopup video pair. Ive been using jquery to navigate the DOM in order to hideshow the correct popup video. So far, Ive gotten that much working, but I need to be able to get the YouTube videos to stop playing whenever the popup is closed.p  pSince I dont think jquery has a builtin postMessage, I guess I have to use javascript for this task But Im having trouble figuring out how to navigate to the iframe thats within the right div.p  pBasically, for every video we have on a page, the html is set up like thisp  precodeltdiv classsmVidBoxgt   ltimg alt stylefloat right margintop 5px titlegitinyvideo srcsfimagesarchitectvideocalloutprof.jpgsfvrsn0 gt ltdivgt  ltdiv idoverlayBGgt      ltdiv idpopupVideoBoxgt          ltdiv idpopupVideoTitlegtCommercial Residentialltdivgt          ltdiv classpopupCloseBtngt             ltimg srcsfimagesdesignvideoclosebtn.jpgsfvrsn0 titlevideoclosebtn gt         ltdivgt          ltdiv idpopupVidContainergt             ltiframe width605 height340 frameborder0 srchttpwww.youtube.comembedurlgtltiframegt          ltdivgt     ltdivgt  ltdivgt codepre  pSo every thumbnailpopup pair is organized in this way. The current jqueryjavascript looks like thisp  precode.popupCloseBtn.clickfunction       this.siblings.hide     this.parent.hide     this.parent.parent.hide     this.hide      var div  document.getElementByIdpopupVidContainer     var iframe  div.getElementsByTagNameiframe[0].contentWindow     state  hide     func  state  hide  pauseVideo  playVideo     iframe.postMessageeventcommand,func  func  ,args,  codepre  pBut the javascript portion used to pause the video doesnt know which popupVidContainer to go to it just goes to the first popupVidContainer it finds, which wont work for anything but, well, the first popupVidContainer.p  pSo how can I navigate to the right popupVidContainer based on this popupCloseBtnp  pAnd yes, I know its bad practice to have multiple IDs on a page. All that will probably be changed to classes at a later date.p  pEdit Answer has been found. Thanks for the helpp

Negative 2904 pIm dealing with UDP and sending some messages. One message contains binary XML and Im using KXML2 with the following a hrefhttpwww.virtualzone.de201102creatingparsingwbxmlwithjavausing.html relnofollowcodea. It runs fine. On UDP, I have to take a fixed buffer at the DatagramPacket.

Negative 2904 pI wrote a program in Java and made a test for it, which tests the program a few billion times with different test data. The program itself only does calculation and is working with strings I cant provide the source code, sorry. To speed things up, it uses a thread pool with 15 threads on a 8 Core CPU with 16 threads, where it takes up to 12 hours to finish.p  pThe problem is, the performance of the whole test differs from start to start. After a little warmup, I normally get 3 millions tests per second, but sometimes only 2 million tests per second. This performance difference stays for the whole test time 812 hours, so it has nothing to do with the JIT. If I cancel a slow test and run it again with the exact same command line, there is a good chance it is faster the second try. So far I noticed a difference of up to 50 from start to start.p  pAm I doing something completely wrong or what could be the causep

Negative 2904 pFirst things first. Theres a good chance what I want to do should really be done with VB and not VBA. But as long as it is possible I would rather use VBA.p  pI have a userform of essentially a big diagram made of hundreds of labels. I want to separate these labels into groups. And then separate these groups into subsystems. The idea being I have some form of heirarchy to work with. The label groups need to change color based on what I have selected in a combo box, and if I click on one of these labels I want to bring up a user form showing details of the subsystem using click events.p  pIm pretty sure I need to use multiple classes to do what I want but am fairly new to using class modules. Though I get the concept. p  pBasically I want some functionality that goes subsystem  label group or part  color with click events for the whole subsystem and combo box events for changing label group colors. I saw a thread online about grouping labels or text boxes but it only works to trigger the even for a group, not change the properties of the whole group once the event is triggered. I would like to set this up in classes as well so I can export the system for use in other future userforms.p  pI was able to create groups of labels and change them together like I wantedp  pCPart Class Module 1 This is meant to handle the event triggering of the labels and includes some color code that I used to test functionality of the groups changing together and functionality of changing colors. Public WithEvents trigger As MSForms.Labelp  precodeDim pLabels As Collection  Property Set triggersc As Collection     Set pLabels  c End Property  Private Sub triggerClick     For Each obj In pLabels         obj.BackColor  RGB255, 0, 0     Next obj End Sub codepre  pCTrigger Class Module 2 This took a collection of labels which were passed in through a collection variable in the userform and then stored each label as a trigger in a separate class variable, along with the whole collection of labels in that group. This way when any trigger fires the event, all of the labels change.p  precodeDim CTrigger As New CPart Dim pLabels As Collection Dim i As Integer  Property Set Labelsc As Collection     Set pLabels  c     For i  1 To pLabels.Count         ReDim Preserve CTrigger1 To i         Set CTriggeri.trigger  pLabels.Itemi         Set CTriggeri.triggers  pLabels     Next i End Property  Property Get Labels As Collection     Labels  pLabels End Property codepre  pI really dont like the way it works, partly because I am losing myself in the logic of it constantly, and partly because it means that in order to use this I have to make collections of labels in the userform module anyway just to run it. It is very inefficient code, but I am putting it up so you get an idea of what I am trying to accomplish.p  pWhat I would much rather do instead is have one class variable to hold my custom collection of labels a LabelGroup. Another class variable is likely required to hold the labels themselves I think. And then all I would have to do is go through and write methods for the LabelGroup class such as changecolor, and it could handle that. But I can handle that part, for now what I really need help with is setting up the class framework in a neat way, so that the module I will eventually run could just say things likep  precodeLabelGroup1.Add Label1 LabelGroup2.Add Label2 codepre  porp  precodePrivate Sub buttonclick     LabelGroup1.ChangeColorRGB...

Negative 2904 pI am working on an IOS application. It launches a codeWebViewcode and loads an HTML page under that using codeNSURLRequestcode.

Is it the codeNSURLRequestcodecodeWebViewcode etc. I dont set any timeout value for the initial codeNSURLRequestcode.

In order to keep the question short, I will just post the part where I interact with Alarm Managerp  precodeAlarmManager mgr  AlarmManager context                 .getSystemServiceContext.ALARMSERVICE         Intent notificationIntent  new Intentcontext, BudgetAlarm.class         PendingIntent pi  null         if bm.getReminderNotify.equalsY                 ampamp percentage gt 90              Calendar calendar  Calendar.getInstance             calendar.setTimeInMillisSystem.currentTimeMillis             calendar.setCalendar.HOUROFDAY, 0             calendar.setCalendar.MINUTE, 1             notificationCount  notificationCount  1               Set request flag to 1 so that the same pending intent in broadcastReceiver             notificationIntent.putExtraNotifyCount, notificationCount             pi  PendingIntent.getBroadcastcontext, 1,                     notificationIntent, PendingIntent.FLAGUPDATECURRENT             mgr.setInexactRepeatingAlarmManager.RTCWAKEUP,                     calendar.getTimeInMillis, AlarmManager.INTERVALDAY, pi codepre  pWhat I am trying to do here is to check if the expenses exceed the budget. And inside the BudgetAlarm class, I am prompting the notificationp  precodeprivate NotificationManager mNotificationManager private Notification notification  Override public void onReceiveContext context, Intent intent      mNotificationManager  NotificationManager context             .getSystemServiceContext.NOTIFICATIONSERVICE     PendingIntent contentIntent  PendingIntent.getActivitycontext, 1,             new Intent, 0     notification  new NotificationR.drawable.iclauncher, Notification,             System.currentTimeMillis     notification.setLatestEventInfocontext, Budget Reminder,             Your monthly expenses nearly exceed the budget,             contentIntent     mNotificationManager.notify             Integer.parseIntintent.getExtras.getNotifyCount                     .toString, notification  codepre  pMy problem now is it does set and trigger the alarm manager every day.

But after a while, I launch the app, then it prompt me again. p  pI wonder is there any way to set the notification to just notify once per day regardless of how many times I launch the apps.

Negative 2904 pIm having issues with NuGet prerelease packages and was wondering what others had done in this situation. NuGet functionality seems completely different, and frankly, strange, from expected behavior in Maven. For a quick example, lets say we have assemblies FooAssembly and BarAssembly, with classes defined as followsp  pFoop  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodenamespace Foo      class FooClass           public void TestA                 codepre  pBarp  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodenamespace Bar      class BarClass           public static void Mainstring[] args              FooClass foo  new FooClass              foo.TestA                 codepre  pWhen I build Foo, its versioned such that it generates Foo1.0.0SNAPSHOT.nupkg. NuGet installs this into Bar when I add it as a dependency, placing it in both my local cache under APPDATA and a packages folder in my source tree. Now, if I add method TestB to Foo, and rebuild, it also generates Foo1.0.0SNAPSHOT.nupkg. My build places this new nupkg file into my APPDATA cache as expected. However, when I try to do a rebuild of Bar, NuGet doesnt detect that my nupkg in APPDATA has changed, and therefore doesnt have the new TestB method available. I have to manually delete the srcpackages folder or at least the Foo subdirectory in packages for it to reacquire the package from my cache.p  pIn Maven, if I were to rebuild Foo with the TestB method added, it would place Foo1.0.0SNAPSHOT in my .m2 cache, and Bar would link against the new version of the jar and would know about TestB.p  pMy question is, firstly, am I missing something with NuGet Secondly, if Im not, what have people done to work around this shortcoming Add an MSBuild prebuild step to wipe out the project package cache Append build numbers to the end of SNAPSHOT e.g. SNAPSHOT42...this seems like it would be problematic with more than one developer on the projectp  pAny insight is appreciated. Thanks.p

Negative 2904 pSometimes I need to hold a reference to object in memory during some time. Weak reference allows this but the time is limited by the garbagecollection cycle. The question is similar to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12971530weakreferencewithaconditiontimeoutthis onea but is related to .NET.p  pI know that there are many caches that have such feature built in but I dont need to utilize a full cache which is a KeyValue map to store only one object. It would rather be a single expirable reference.p  pI know that I can implement this myself but Im looking for a standard implementation ideally integrated in the framework, in case Ive missed itp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pBased on the answers from Jeroen Mostert and dariogriffo I add more details to the question.p  pOk, so there are two ways either use keyvalue cache or timerbased callback. Lets assume there is a tree of objects each having a reference to a cached value. These values have an expiration timeout. Assume count of tree nodes is large. If I store each value in the MemoryCahce this requires to assign unique keys to the nodes and access to their values is made by hash table search. Also it has some computation complexity of adding new keys to the table. From the other hand if I use my custom codeWeakReferenceByTimeOutcode as dariogriffo suggests then It doesnt have such problems. Instead, there is an overhead because I need to create one timer object per value object or Task object that is using timer internally, I guess. From my point of view the second approach is better but Im not sure.p

Negative 2904 pI currently have 3 tabs connected to a common UITabBarController. When one of the tabs is selected the user is taken to a UITableView with 3 cells which can be selected. When a cell is selected the user is taken to a new page with a UINavigationBar at the top. My understanding is that the UINavigationBar is supposed to include some sort of back button and I couldnt figure out how to enable it.p  pIn place of the default back button, I dragged a UIButton to the corner and connected it to the Show Detail property of the previous view but when I press the UIButton I am taken to the right UITableView but the tabs are missing for navigation.

The problems only on initial start.p  pIs there a mechanism within codeNEventStorecode to either simply append without opening, or to determine the head revision without opening the whole stream so I can then open from the last version and append. Of course I could also go direct to the database and query, but thats taking on a dependency I feel I shouldnt need.p

However I am particularly looking to ASCIIprint the graph, or at least come as close to displaying the graph in a human friendly way as possible.p  pWhat is the easiest known way to do this It looks like a really unusual thing to do, considering how much help is available online.p
Negative 2904 pI am trying to add a waveform visual to my already functioning app that will record a sound, and then play it back. The recordingplayback code works fine, but when I tried to add the a hrefhttpsgithub.comfelixpalmerandroidvisualizer relnofollowcom.pheelicks.appa visualizer, and record my own sound, then try to play it back, I get a crash when I hit my own play button. p  pIn his visualizer app, he provides his own mp3 sound files, which play through MediaPlayer. But since I also play my recorded sound through MediaPlayer, I figured it should be easy to adjust my code to include his visualizer part. But something is wrong.p  pThe strange part is that his code runs perfectly in my Android phone Samsung Galaxy 5, I can see the visualizer to the music.p  pI have tried to research similar problems, but I dont find answers there. I have tried a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions20400541javalangillegalargumentexceptionwidthandheightmustbe0whensettingbithisa and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17605662illegalargumentexceptionwidthandheightmustbe0whileloadingbitmapfromthisa, both similar errors, but I did not find a solution. p  pThe error seems to be coming from his code, the strongVisualizerView.javastrong in the Bitmap part where codegetWidthcode and codegetHeightcode is called from codeCanvascode in the codeonDrawcode method. I also tried to log these values, but they are not showing up in my codeLogCatcode. Im using Android Studio. Thanks for your helpp  pEDITp  pAh, I see my codeLogcode statement did not work because it was placed after the point of the crash. I placed it right before the crash pointp  precodeif mCanvasBitmap  null          mCanvasBitmap  Bitmap.createBitmapcanvas.getWidth,                 canvas.getHeight, Config.ARGB8888      codepre  pAnd I get this from LogCat codeValue of getWidth is 924 and value of getHeight is 0code.

Negative 2904 pI am doing a project on recognizing objects using only depth information from Kinect depth images. The idea is to have some objects trained into my system and recognize them whenever I scan them again with the Kinect camera. I have found some algorithms that extract features from depth images or point clouds, such as NARF, SURE, 3D SURF etc. However, being a beginner in this topic, I am quite confused and dont really know if those are the ones that would do the job for me.

Negative 2904 pThis is a bit of a complex request and there is very probably not an easy way to complete this. I am trying to create a stacked area between two series. p  pI have two metrics, Y1 and Y2, that need to be graphed. The graph needs to show Y1 as an area for series 1, and the difference between Y1 and Y2 as an area for series 2 with Y2 always being positive  therefore, series 2 will always be more positive than series 1. That means the area for series 2 should not be from its line to the axis, but to series 1.p  pMy best attempt has been this graph a hrefhttpi.imgur.comd8syYu1.png relnofollowhttpi.imgur.comd8syYu1.pnga. The goal Im trying to achieve is to have the the black series 2 underneath the blue series 1 to shade in the inverse of what is overlapped by the blue. If the blue series 1 is positive, the black series 2 would be even more positive and the area would be between its line and the blue series 1 line.p  pThe data for 52015 here are 600,000 for Series 1 and 500,000 for Series 2, so I would want the 500,000 difference between the two values to be colored by the black, rather than the 100,000.p

Negative 2904 pI am setting up refresh tokens in a web service that is based on the Web API 2 template. It is going to be consumed by both our own website as well as external clients. p  pAfter researching for some time, the general recommendation on securing the refresh token from XSS attacks is to store the identifier within an encrypted cookie.

Now i just want the name to be relevent with the amount of bottles input by the user. ie, if I put in 20 bottles i want the name of the text file to be Twenty Green Bottles rather than Ten Green Bottles Codep  precodenum1intinputPick a number between 10 and 30   def main     numbers [ no, One, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six, Seven,      Eight, Nine, Ten, Eleven, Twelve, Thirteen, Fourteen, Fifteen,     Sixteen, Seventeen, Eighteen, Nineteen, Twenty, Twentyone,      Twentytwo, Twentythree, Twentyfour, Twentyfive, Twentysix,         Twentyseven, Twentyeight, Twentynine, Thirty ] textone  green bottlesnHanging on the wall texttwo  nAnd if one green bottlenShould accidentally fallnTherell be textthree  n   with open Green Bottles.txt, w as a     for l in rangenum1, 0, 1         a.writenumbers[l]           if l  1             a.writetextone   n         else             a.writetextone  s n          a.writenumbers[l]            if l  1             a.writetextone     n          else             a.writetextone  s   n         a.writetexttwo            a.writenumbers[l1]            if l  1 1              a.writetextone  n         else             a.writetextone  sn         a.writen  n    if name  main main codepre

The javascript simply grabs the last job on the list and uses that as its jobs name. So in essence it is grabbing the input box correctly its just placing it in the wrong row. p  pHere is the javascript that handles this change.p  precodevar job  document.getElementsByNamesjobname.value var comment  document.getElementsByNamesjobdesc.value var url  ltphp echo FILENAMEORDERSEDITAJAX gtactioninsertcommentinstallampoIDltphp  echo GET[oID] gt ampnewcomment  value  ampjobname  job codepre  pI know I should be grabbing the elements with getElementByNames but I just dont know how to pair up the comment with the proper job that its supposed to go with. So if someone comments next to the input box for Granite Job the comment should be paired up with the job name Granite Job in the database. Instead currently it will just be paired up with the last job on the list which is Cabinet Assembly.p  pAny help would be appreciated.p

Negative 2904 pI am a C windows developer. I recently started to work with WinJS. Working with WinJS, I have noticed some challenges and limitations. Can face some new challenges as the community support for WinJS is very less. Below are the few points mentioned regarding this concernp  pa. WinJS does not support Visual Studio features like Finding References of Classes and Variables which is very useful to code productively.p  pb. WinJS is not strongly typed as C. So we will get to know about the errors at runtime only instead of compile time which is difficult to Debug and time taking process.p  pc. WinJS does not support feature What you see is what you get. Visual Studio designer is not available for WinJS. We can see the application design only after we run the application which is again time taking thing.  p  pThere are very less chances of availability of Ready to Work on WinJS resources. Because most of the developers in Windows community work on C, XAML languages.p  pd. Direct compatibility of third party libraries for WinJS might not be available. p  pHave anybody experience in WinJS and faced similar issues Or Are there any solutions exists for this What is the scope of improvement in Windows 10 version for WinJSp

Negative 2904 pI am filling a CursorLoader for an app that has been in the play store for over a year now.  There is no trouble with it crashing or any complaints about it.  The trouble is, without the use of stored procedures, it has a massive SQL statement to fill the loader.  To make this a little more manageable, I used string variables to build it up.  Without the string variables, it would unfold to several pages of unmanageable SQL statement.  The app is CardioLogger in the play store.

Negative 2904 pIn my lighting scene, for some reason the ambient lighting isnt working at all. The whole model is the same brightness, no matter which way it is facing.

It is supposed to shine based on player position.

Negative 2904 pso Im reasonably new to Robot Framework and have run into various forms of this issue a number of times now.  Essentially I create a suite of tests which eventually pass and check for the things I expect, they then go through a CICD pipeline and on the dedicated test runners I hit some failures.  In essence this seems to be because the test runners do things a little faster, whether due to hardware or selenium speed, it doesnt really matter.p  pTo avoid these failures I end up adding to the tests to slow them down at certain points to ensure success, basically bloating them or just being a little more protective.  So for those with more experience, how do you handle this situation  Id like to stick with best practice as far as I can, i.e. Im not just using sleeps everywhere but using implicit waits, still I dont know what the best approaches are.p  pHeres snippet of an issue Ive hit recentlyp  precodeWait Until Page Contains Element STATICTABLEXPATHsomepath 10 imagetext  Selenium2Library.Get Element Attribute STATICTABLEXPATHsomepath secondparagraphtext  Selenium2Library.Get Text STATICTABLEXPATHsomepath codepre  pSo basically despite these being functionally correct, they pull back nothing sometimes when run on the test runners.  I figure this is because things are happening too quickly, so I added a Wait Until Page Contains Element, unfortunately the same problem still exists.  Is there a best way to handle this situation so it consistently passesp  pI thought adding a wait until keyword succeeds on the expected variable value would be pretty horrible but happy to be proved wrongp

Negative 2904 pIm developing an application with time series data with Dynamodb and Node.js My data comes from temperature at 1 measuremin. At first Ive created a unique table with hash device id and range ISO 8601 date format. Im now able to display a 24h d3 chart of this data per device though Id like to increase granularity of my chart allowing me to display 1 week, 1 month and even 1 year data. Processing all the data on each access is impractical so the idea its to create other tables for this data. Like 1 hour, 1 day and 1 month averages data. Actualizing the data simultaneous in all tables would made it expensive.

Negative 2904 pIm creating FrameLayouts and Fragments at runtime.  I have a LinearLayout R.id.presentationRight in my xml file.  Every time I need a new fragment within that layout, I do the following.p  ul liCreate a new FrameLayout and add it to the LinearLayoutli liGenerate an ID for the FrameLayout so FragmentTransaction can reference itli liCreate a new Fragmentli liPerform a FragmentTransaction to place the new Fragment in the new frame.li ul  pThe code looks like thisp  precodeLinearLayout presentationRight  LinearLayout findViewByIdR.id.presentationRight FrameLayout bluRayFrame  new FrameLayoutMainActivity.this bluRayFrame.setIdView.generateViewId presentationRight.addViewbluRayFrame  BluRayFragment bluRayFragment  new BluRayFragment  FragmentTransaction fragmentTransaction  getSupportFragmentManager.beginTransaction fragmentTransaction.replacebluRayFrame.getId, bluRayFragment fragmentTransaction.commit codepre  pIt works perfectly.  I can run as many copies of this method as I want and it always adds another instance of this fragment to the LinearLayout, which is exactly what I want.p  pThe problem comes when the screen rotates.  When I had a single existing frame in the layout and I was just replacing the existing frame, rotation worked perfectly.  You could view the app in portrait or landscape and it always reloaded the fragment perfectly.  However, now that the framelayout Im addressing isnt actually in the XML file, it crashes the app and gives me a null pointer within the Fragment itself when it tries to reference container.getContext.  Im assuming that since the Fragment isnt actually tied to the xml file that when the Activity reloads on rotate, the container isnt there so the context isnt there, but I dont know how to fix it.p  pIm not doing anything special to handle the rotation right now, just letting the activity do everything on its own.p  pThoughts  Id really like to avoid creating a bunch of framelayouts in code and referencing them individually because i dont know how many of these fragments will eventually be necessary, so writing it open ended seems like the best way to handle things if I can figure out how.p
