Positive 40 pI want to create a website using python without cms system, that is, say no to Django, Plesk, and the etc. I want to use fusion table to do sql search on page urls. And print out html and JavaScript files to the public  folder by python. I dont mind to reinvent the wheel. What is the strategy here. Can someone point to me to some web which implements this. Simply use google api as an interface. I also consider create a json server and use my own api to get and post data if fusion table api is limited. However its not at this stage. I simply dont like the idea of cms. Basically, you can not change specific pages layout in cms. Why is it so prevalent Can someone give me some guidance here. Another reason cms is bad is because of size limit. Database is a file. How big can a file be 16Tb is the limit possibly. I am aiming for 1000Tb with 100 millions pages here.p

Negative 40 pWhat is the best way to trigger an animation while using the MVVM pattern More specifically, I have a form which has several fields. When a user clicks the save codeButtoncode, I would like to show an animation. I have been able to achieve this by exposing a property strongShowMessagestrong and setting it to True and a codeDataTriggercode picks up this value and starts an animation. However, while the animation is still active, I would like to reset the form to a clean state. So far Ive done the reset by subscribing to the codeCompletecode event on the codeStoryboardcode and resetting the view models state on that event. p  pIdeally I would like to be able to somehow trigger an animation from the view model because the save would be an asynchronous operation and let the animation run to completion. The way I have it now wouldnt work because once I change the value of the strongShowMessagestrong property on the reset, the animation stops and doesnt run to completion.p  pDoes any one have a better solutionp  pThanksp

My question is, what data type do I set True, False and Unknown to Right now I havep  precodestruct Tribool      True, False, and Unknown public constants     public static readonly Tribool TRUE, FALSE, UNKNOWN      Constructors     public Tribool              Tribool  FALSE use ValueType instead      codepre  pbut Im not sure if thats correct, since it looks like Im just setting a Tribool to another Tribool. Should I use ValueType instead It popped up when I was typing in VS, and it sounds sensible, but I wasnt able to find a lot of information on it from Google. p  pAlso, the Tribool needs to be able to operate with regular bools, which means true and false need to be overloaded. Would this require an operator overload Or should it just be a method that returns a boolp  pThanks in advancep  pEdit Sorry, I should have mentioned this was for an assignment. So I cant use bools even though its a lot more practical as many of you have pointed out. p

Negative 40 pI am currently working on a C sparse matrixmathiterative solver library, for a simulation tool I manage.  I would have preferred to use an existing package, however, after extensive investigation, none were found that were appropriate for our simulator we looked at flens, it, PetSC, eigen, and several others.  The good news is my solvers and sparse matrix structures are now very efficient and robust.  The bad news is, I am now looking into parallelization using OpenMP, and the learning curve is a bit steep.p  pThe domain we solve can be broken into subdomains, which come together in a blockdiagonal format.  So our storage scheme ends up looking like an array of smaller square matrices blocks[] each with a format appropriate to the subdomain e.g. Compressed Row Storage CRS, Compressed Diagonal Storage CDS, Dense, etc.., and a background matrix currently using CRS that accounts for the connectivity between subdomains.p  pThe hot spot in most all iterative solvers is the Matrix Vector multiplication operation, and this is true of my library.  Thus, Ive been focusing my efforts on optimizing my MxV routines.  For the block diagonal structure, the pseudo code for Mxb would be as followsp  precodebbackgroundmatrixx startindex  1 endindex  0 fori1number of blocks      endindexstartindexblocks[i].numRows     b.rangestartindex, endindex  blocks[i]  x.rangestartindex, endindex     startindex  endindex1  codepre  pwhere backgroundmatrix is the background CRS matrix, blocks is the array of subdomain matrices, and .range returns the portion of the vector from a starting index to an ending index.p  pObviously the loop can be and has been parallelized, as the operations are independent of other iterations of the loop the ranges are nonoverlapping.  Since we have 1015 blocks in a typical system, 4 threads actually makes a significant difference.p  pThe other place where parallelization has been seen to be a good option in is in the MxV operation for each subdomain storage scheme calls in lines 1 and 6 in the above code.  There is plenty out there on parallelizing CRS, CDS, and dense matrix MxV operations.  Typically a nice boost is seen with 2 threads, with greatly diminishing returns as more threads are added.p  pI am envisioning a scheme, where 4 threads would be used in the block loop for the above code, and each of those threads would use 2 threads for the subdomain solves.  However, I am not sure how, using OpenMP, one would manage the pool of threads is it possible to limit the number of threads in an openmp for loop  Is this multilevel parallelism something that in practice makes sense  Any other thoughts on what Ive proposed here would be appreciated and thanks for reading all the way to the endp

Negative 40 pI am developing a UserControl, call it CoolControl, that is meant to act somewhat like a window, with a few special features.  So far, it can be resized and dragged all around the screen.  If I add multiple CoolControl objects to my application window using XAML, the last one that was declared is always in front.  This is fine, but I want to make it so that if I click on one of my CoolControl objects during runtime, that control will put itself in front of all the other controls.p  pIve tried using codeCanvas.SetZIndexcode, but unless Im simply unable to come up with a clever enough solution, I dont see how that can help me. Because once I set one controls ZIndex to 9999, over time every other control I click will have the same value of 9999. And then, once again, the control declared last ends up in front.p  pIf you were given the task of writing a BringToFront method for someones UserControl, how would you do it in the simplest way possible  Id prefer a better solution than getting the parent window, looping through all the controls, finding the maximum ZIndex, and then setting the ZIndex of the CoolControl accordingly, if THAT is even a valid solution.p

However, with the .Distinct it takes upwards of 4 minutes to complete.  There are a lot of rows in the tables, and some of the where clause fields do not have indexes.  However, the number of records returned is fairly small a few dozen at most.p  pThe confusing part about it is that if I get the SQL generated by the Linq query, via Linqpad, then execute that code as SQL or in SQL Management Studio including the DISTINCT it executes in about 3 seconds.  p  pstrongWhat is the difference between the Linq query and the executed SQLstrong  p  pI have a short term workaround, and thats to return the set without .Distinct as a List, then using .Distinct on the list, this takes about 2 seconds.

Negative 40 pI know it is possible to assign an unsigned char to an unsigned short, but I would like to have more control how the bits are actually assigned to the unsigned short.p  precodeunsigned char UC8 unsigned short US16  UC8  0xff US16  unsigned char UC8 codepre  pThe bits from UC8 are now placed in the lower bits of US16. I need more control of the conversion since the application Im currently working on are safety related. Is it possible to control the conversion with bit operators So I can specify where the 8 bits from the unsigned char should be placed in the bigger 16 bit unsigned short variable. p  pMy guess is that it would be possible with masking combined with some other bitoperator, maybe leftright shifting. p  precodeUC8  0xff US16  US16 amp 0x00ff  UC8  Maybe masking codepre  pI have tried different combinations but have not come up with a smart solution. Im using ansi C and as said earlier, need more control how the bits actually are set in the larger variable.p  pEDIT My problem or concern comes from a CRC generating function. It will and should always return an unsigned short, since it will sometimes calculate an 16 bit CRC. But sometimes it should calculate a 8 bit CRC instead, and place the 8 bit on the eight LSB in the 16 bit return variable. And on the eight MSB should then contain only zeros. p  pI would like to say something like p  precodeUS167 downto 0  UC8  US1615 downto 8  0x00 codepre  pIf I just typecast it, can I guarantee that the bits always will be placed on the lower bits in the larger variable On all different architecturesp

Negative 40 pI have a page thats very imageintensive. This is by client request  its a list of merchants with a logo for each one. The list is quite long over 500, and yes  the client insists on displaying all of them. We do have an ajax typeahead search to help users find what theyre looking for without scrolling, so its not a total disaster. p  pHeres the issue the client is just now realizing that it takes a long time to load this page because of all the logos. Even if each one is only a few kb, it still adds up pretty quickly. Hes now decided he wants a progress bar to display while the images are loading. Ive never done that before, so I starting looking around, and most of the ones Ive seen rely on getting an array of img tags and looping through to check the complete property. The problem Im having at least I think this is whats causing the problem is that the image tags are generated by a database query, and I think the javascript to get the image array is loading before the image tags are finished loading. Obviously this isnt an issue on pages where the images are hardcoded.p  pCan anyone point me in the right direction of how I can implement a progress bar on img tags that get loaded dynamically My site is written in PHP, so Im perfectly happy to do something serverside if that would work better.p

Negative 40 pIm having a strange problem when resizing a canvas parent, which happens to be a ChildWindow.p  pFrom a high level, this is what Im trying to do when a user clicks on a buttonp  ol liUnhide a row, by setting the RowDefinition height from 0 to something larger.li liResize the canvas, since everything inside is taller.li liResize the canvas parent a ChildWindow, since the canvas is taller.li ol  pSteps 1 and 2 work fine. The problem is with step 3 when I step through the FSilverlight code, all of the sizes appear to be set correctly.

Whats more, is that when the user clicks the button again to toggle the row visibility, the row disappears but the extra space at the top of the window remains. Initially, this empty space is not there. See this imagep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comoLWP2.jpg altalt textp  pAny thoughtshelp would be greatly appreciated. Thanksp

Negative 40 pNew Rails programmer here.  There is probably a pretty simple solution to this, but I just cant figure it out.  Heres the deal lets say I have many posts on a single page. Each post has a content field, and some of those content fields contain hashtags within the content.p  pI want to develop an algorithm that scans the content of every single post say, every 2 seconds and displays a list of every hashtag.  Im thinking AJAX will be necessary, because the posts feature AJAX editinplace.  Thus, if a post is changed and a new hashtag is created, the hashtag list should be updated automatically to reflect this.  Also, each hashtag on the hashtag list should be clickable, sending a search query and in turn displaying the posts that contain the selected hashtag.p  pThis end result is similar to tagging and a tag cloud, but should be dynamic and integrated as opposed to having a tag field for each post.  I dont want to attach any tags to the posts as a database column.  I just want the application to scan the content of every single post and display a clickable hashtag list.p  pAll suggestions are greatly appreciated.p

Negative 40 pIs it possible to write a program that serves both as a Server and a Client Suppose I have three instances of the program P P1, P2, and P3. p  ol liIn one use case, P2 requests file from P1. li liWhile P1 is serving the file to P2, P1 requests file form P3. li liP3 serves the file to P1. At this point, P3 is able to uploaddownload from P1 or P2.li ol  blockquote   pConceptually, I should be able to do   this by running the server part in a   thread every time a request comes in.   Is there a different approach to thisp blockquote  pEDITp  hr  pI have some initial code that allows me, as a Client, to request a file from a Server provided the server port number and file name. The same code also starts up a Server thread that listens for incoming requests alongside. So, in effect, this code base serves as a Peer both client and server.  p  pBut, my issue now is after making the first request for a file, the code loops forever in the Server part, effectively not allowing me to make any additional request as a Client. My question then is Can I keep a socket open while the server listens to the port strongwithoutstrong needing for the Server to loop infinitely This way, I can run the Server in the background and be able to send commands to the Client as needed.p
Negative 40 pI bumped into something unexpected just now, and it reminded me that there is still much I do not know about SQL.p  pI have a reporting query which uses codeUNION ALLcode to concatenate results for different date ranges and store them, in HTML form, in a temp table.  The query gave a NULL value for the MTD range today, as there was no activity on the 1st.

However, if I add a field to the SELECT clausep  precodeSELECT     70000,     lttrgt      dbo.FormatAsHTMLRowHeadMonth to date      dbo.FormatAsHTMLCelldbo.FormatIntegerSUMLeads, R      lttrgt FROM     RawResults WHERE     Date  20110501 codepre  pThen I get a single row with a NULL valuep  precodeSequence HTML   70000    NULL codepre  pQuerying codeSELECT Field FROM RawResults WHERE Date  20110501code returns no results, so it seems that a UDF acting on a nonliteral causes SQL to return a row even when theres no matching value in the codeWHEREcode clause.  Is this some weird edge case, or does this make perfect sense for some reason that escapes me this morningp

Negative 40 pIm trying to create a set for an object in PHP that works with multidimensional arrays. Is this even possiblep  pI would like to be able to something like the following codepostgtcomments[0][uid]3code. However, comments is actually going to be a key in a private cache variable codecache[comments]arraycode. Itd be nice if the set function could somehow get both the base key comments and the index 0 as well as the keyvalue it is setting uid3. However, thats not possible.p  pIve thought about making codecache[comments]code and array of ArrayObjects but that wouldnt let me define a custom emgetemset overload. Instead, I think that I might end up having to create a new Comments object and then fill the array with those. However, I really wouldnt like to do this and itd be sweet if somehow PHP could handle nested arrays in set overloads.p  pIm using Mongo and would like if I could just have one single object for each document. However, arrays objects in Mongo are creating a bit of a problem for me. I would like to just handle them as an array in PHP but that doesnt seem possible. The setter needs to take codepostgtcomments[0][uid]3code and update both the cache as well as setting codethisgtdata[comments][0][uid]3code. p  pI know that if comments was an array of objects I could do thisp  precodepostgtcomments[0]gtuid3  Sets cache[comments][0]gtuid3 codepre  pAnd it would work because the getter for comments would return the array of objects and allow it to access the uid property. I could then have a gettersetter within the comments object that would somehow edit the codepostgtdatacode through a pseudo friend functionhack. However, I dont see an easy way of accomplishing this with arrays....p  pAny advicep

Negative 40 pI have a web application STS with Login.aspx form with usernamepassword TextBoxes. In the code behined I process the textbox controls to sign in the user. It is custom security token service and other web applications use it for single sign on. Normaly it works through redirects.p  pFrom another web app MyApp I would like to sign in passing in usernamepassword values collected on MyApps page. So I wrote a POST method request trying to emulate sign in on STSLogin.aspx. The request looks well but the solution does not work. The text box controls values are not set. Fortunately I can modify STS application and read the data from Request.Form collection. However, I would like to know if this is correct behavior or if it could be configured so that the Login.aspx form could get the data transparently in text box controls.p  pI examined the postback request generated by submit button directly from Login.aspx and my own generted POST request and they differ only in requests Referer and VIEWSTATE but viewstate is disabled for the page. Therefore I guess that asp.net checks the Referer and decides if it considers the rquest as postback or not and only if it is postback then it loads the data into controls. But its just guess and I would like to know.p

Negative 40 pHere is the situation I need to deal with. I appreciate any kind of input. There is a tennis court all wired with sensors. The net, the lines all have builtin sensors. All these sensors are sending signals to a USB device which is connected to a laptop computerCOMP1. There are also 2 projector screens in the court for the spectators. Projectors are connected to a separate computerCOMP2 and they can act as external monitors. I want to develop an eventdriven application and run it on COMP1 which will be monitoring the sensors. When it gets a signal, it would send a message to COMP2 which then displays the info on the projectors in a web browser. Both computers are wifi enabled. How would you design such a system Would you use ajax , web services, wcf, javascript Obviously, it will have a server COMP1 and a client COMP2. I dont want to run a timer on COMP2 to poll the sensors. I want it pure eventdriven. Sensor  COMP1  COMP2  screenp  pThanks for your help, in advance.p

Negative 40 pI was wondering if an API exist that would allow me to dump a synergy database through java.

Any body know of a possible way to do thatp

I know I can iterate the collections using the same indexer to correlate the values, but this seems error prone since it may be possible for one of my h2 elements to not have a adjacent table element rare but possible.p  pstrongExample HTML markupstrongp  precodelth1gt     Results Pagelth1gt lth2gt     Updated Daily  1000 AMlth2gt ltdiv classsomeClass1gt     lt Results gt     ltdiv classsomethinggt     ltdivgt     lth2 styledisplay inlinegt         lta hrefhttpwww.somesite.comgtTable 1ltagt     lth2gt     ltdiv classclrgt     ltdivgt     ltdiv classresultBlockgt         lttable classstockfeedgt             lttheadgt                 lttrgt                     ltthgt                         Part                     ltthgt                     ltthgt                         Description                     ltthgt                     ltthgt                         Stock                     ltthgt                     ltthgt                         Price                     ltthgt                 lttrgt             lttheadgt             lttbodygt                 lttr classrow1 valigntopgt                     lttdgt                         A 1234567890                     lttdgt                     lttd classdescriptiongt                         Part Description                     lttdgt                     lttdgt                         1,000,000                     lttdgt                     lttdgt                         1.99                     lttdgt                 lttrgt                 lttr classrow1 valigntopgt                     lttdgt                         B 1234567890                     lttdgt                     lttd classdescriptiongt                         Part Description                     lttdgt                     lttdgt                         1,000,000                     lttdgt                     lttdgt                         1.99                     lttdgt                 lttrgt                 lttr classrow1 valigntopgt                     lttdgt                         C 1234567890                     lttdgt                     lttd classdescriptiongt                         Part Description                     lttdgt                     lttdgt                         1,000,000                     lttdgt                     lttdgt                         1.99                     lttdgt                 lttrgt             lttbodygt         lttablegt     ltdivgt     lt Results gt     ltdiv classsomethinggt     ltdivgt     lth2 styledisplay inlinegt         lta hrefhttpwww.somesite.comgtTable 2ltagt     lth2gt     ltdiv classclrgt     ltdivgt     ltdiv classresultBlockgt         lttable classstockfeedgt             lttheadgt                 lttrgt                     ltthgt                         Part                     ltthgt                     ltthgt                         Description                     ltthgt                     ltthgt                         Stock                     ltthgt                     ltthgt                         Price                     ltthgt                 lttrgt             lttheadgt             lttbodygt                 lttr classrow1 valigntopgt                     lttdgt                         A 1234567890                     lttdgt                     lttd classdescriptiongt                         Part Description                     lttdgt                     lttdgt                         1,000,000                     lttdgt                     lttdgt                         1.99                     lttdgt                 lttrgt                 lttr classrow1 valigntopgt                     lttdgt                         B 1234567890                     lttdgt                     lttd classdescriptiongt                         Part Description                     lttdgt                     lttdgt                         1,000,000                     lttdgt                     lttdgt                         1.99                     lttdgt                 lttrgt                 lttr classrow1 valigntopgt                     lttdgt                         C 1234567890                     lttdgt                     lttd classdescriptiongt                         Part Description                     lttdgt                     lttdgt                         1,000,000                     lttdgt                     lttdgt                         1.99                     lttdgt                 lttrgt             lttbodygt         lttablegt     ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pstrongCurrent code to parse the values separatelystrongp  precode    HtmlNodeCollection titles  doc.DocumentNode.SelectNodescomment[contains.,Results]followingsiblingh2     for int tit  0 tit lt titles.Count tit               Do Something           HtmlNodeCollection tables  doc.DocumentNode.SelectNodestable[classstockfeed]     for int tab  0 tab lt tables.Count tab               Do Something      codepre
Negative 40 pI am starting work on a large project in Rails 3.  I want to build the app using both MySql and MongoDB.  I already know how to use Rails with MySql, and have found a lot of info about using MongoDB and rails.  But what I have not been able to find is any good information on using both MySql and MongoDB together.  I was looking at the Mongoid project, and thought it would be good to use, thought I dont know if it is the best solution.  p  pOn the Mongoid site under the InstallationConfiguration section it talks about using both Mongoid and ActiveRecord together, but it does not explain how.p  pSo, I was hoping someone could tell me either how to set Mongoid and ActiveRecord to work together, or a better solution all together.p

Negative 40 pHaving a javascript issue and was wondering if you could help me at all please. The problem Im having is with variables not being picked up, thinking its possibly a scope issue but cant figure it out.p  pIm trying to set up a google maps based app using jquery mobile and have been using a hrefhttpwww.mobiledevelopersolutions.comhomestarttwominutetutorialstmt4part1 relnofollowhttpwww.mobiledevelopersolutions.comhomestarttwominutetutorialstmt4part1a tutorials but adjusting to suit my needs.p  pThe overall plan is to have a list of links which when you click on them open up different locations on a map and a trail finder from your current location to the new destination.p  pSo Ive a function set up to pull in info from a hrefs dataidentity.p  precodelta hrefpagemap classdestinationlink datarolebutton dataidentity53.37677497506021, 6.274824142456055 dataiconstargtLocation linkltagt codepre  pThe info its pulling in is latlong coordinates.

Negative 40 pI have been tasked with updating our internal framework we use inhouse. One of the things the framework does is you pass it a query and it will return the number of rows the query has in it The framework makes heavy use of DataReaders so we need the total before hand for UI things. p  pThe query that the count needs to be done on can be different from project to project SOLinjection is not a issue, the query is not from user input, just hard coded in from another programmer when they use the framework for their project. and I was told that just having the programmers write a second query for the count is unacceptable.p  pCurrently the solution is to do the following I did not write this, I was just told to fix it.p  precodeexecutes query and returns record count public static int RecordCountstring SqlQuery, string ConnectionString, bool SuppressError  false       SplitLeft is just myString.Substring0, myString.IndexOfpattern with some error checking. and InStr is just a wrapper for IndexOf.     remove order by clause breaks count     if Str.InStr0, SqlQuery.ToLower,  order by  gt 1         SqlQuery  Str.SplitLeftSqlQuery.ToLower,  order by       try              execute query         using SqlConnection cnSqlConnect  OpenConnectionConnectionString, SuppressError         using SqlCommand SqlCmd  new SqlCommandselect count from   SqlQuery   as a, cnSqlConnect                      SqlCmd.CommandTimeout  120             return Int32SqlCmd.ExecuteScalar                   catch Exception ex              if SuppressError  false             MessageBox.Showex.Message, Sql.RecordCount          return 1        codepre  pHowever it breaks on queries like again, not my query, I just need to make it workp  precodeselect [ClientID], [Date], [Balance]  from [Ledger]  where Seq  select top 1 Seq               from [Ledger] as l               where l.[ClientID]  [Ledger].[ClientID]               order by [Date] desc, Seq desc        and Balance ltgt 0 codepre  pas it will removes everything after the codeorder bycode and breaks the query.

We write apps to pull data from a clients old database and move it in to our database format when a customer buys our a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiCustomerrelationshipmanagement relnofollowCRMa software. Often we are working with source tables that are poorly written and can be several Gigs in size. We do not have the resources to hold the whole table in memory so we use a DataReader to pull the data out so everything is not in memory at once. However a requirement is a progress bar with the total number of records to be processed. This RecordCount function is used to figure the max of the progress bar. It works fairly well, the only snag is if the programmer writing the conversion needs to order the data output, having a codeorder bycode clause in the outer most query breaks codecountcodep  hr  pstrongPartial Solutionstrong I came up with this while trying to figure it out, it will not work 100 of the time but I think it will be better than the current solutionp  pIf I find a order by clause, I then check to see if the first thing in the query is a select and no Top following I replace that beginning text with codeselect top 100 percentcode. It works better but I am not posting this as a solution as I am hoping for a universal solution.p

Negative 40 pFirst, Id like to say that Ive spent a lot of time searching for an explanationsolution.  Ive found hints of the problem, but no way to resolve my particular issue.  Hence the post on a topic that seems to have been beaten to death in at least some cases.p  pI have a Java test class that tests for proper encodingdecoding by a Mime utility.  The strings used for testing are declared in the source file and we use assertEquals to test equality after processing the input string.  Heres an examplep  precodeString test  S2, iso88591QFE4ltstrF6m iso88591Q,Patrik S3 String expected  S2, Fltstrm, PatrikS3 codepre  pIn my editor and other external editors such as Notepad and UltraEdit, the input strings are properly displayed if I choose to read it as windows1252 or ISO88591 encoding UTF8 displays the expected string as Fltstrm.p  pWhen compiled and run on a Windows 7 machine, I get the following outputp  pExpected S2, Fltstrm, PatrikS3p  pActual   S2, Fltstrm, PatrikS3p  pI get this behaviour in a command shell as well as in my code editor.  Bizarrely, it works on a Windows XP machine.  Yet I checked the codepage using chcp in a command shell and I get the same output in both cases.  The only way I got this to work is to compile the class using encoding windows1252, which I dont want to be doing for a variety of reasons.p  pSo the questions are 1 whats different between XP and Windows 7 that makes this fail  Has the default platform encoding changed 2 how can I fix so that it will work both on a Windows 7 machine and a Linux machinep  pThanks a lot for any insightp
Negative 40 pLets say youre implementing your own version of stackoverflow once again, yesp  pYou have a service that provides all the required functionality like thisp  precodeclass Question  ...   EF entity class Answer  ...   EF entity  interface IStackoverflowService      void PostQuestionQuestion question     void PostAnswerAnswer answer     void UpdateQuestionQuestion question     ...  codepre  pThat seems to be pretty simple and generally I believe its a good idea. The only thing that I dont like here is that client code ASP.NET MVC controllers has direct access to codeQuestioncodes and codeAnswercodes. Pretend we have some tough BL related with posting questions and answers. Its good idea to have this logic concentrated in a single place  on a service layer. In case your client code has access to codeQuestioncodes, its possible that someday somebody will decide to add just a little bit of logic to one of your controllers which is basically bad idea.p  pIm thinking about defining a number of DTOs which will be the part of service interface, so the client code will only be able to work with these DTOs that contain just the right amount of details.p  pLets say your question entity is defined like thisp  precodeinterface Question      int Id  get set      User Poster  get set      DateTime Posted  get set      DateTime Edited  get set      string Title  get set      string Text  get set      IQueryableltAnswergt Answers  get set      ...  codepre  pWhen posting the question, the request should only contain codeTitlecode, codeTextcode and codePostercode. So, Ill define a codePostQuestionDTOcodep  precodeclass PostQuestionDTO      User Poster  get set      string Title  get set      string Text  get set   codepre  pWhen somebody opens the page to check the question, theres a little bit more details like codePostedcode and codeEditedcodep  precodeclass QuestionDetailsDTO      User Poster  get set      string Title  get set      string Text  get set      DateTime Posted  get set      DateTime Edited  get set   codepre  pAnd so on. Is it a good practice or do you think its overengineering What are the common approaches herep

The comments would then be entered below the video.p  pAny help on trying to make something like this either using javascript or flash would be appreciated. p  pthaknsp

Negative 40 pIve just been given my first real C application on the job after working through some books learning the language. It was my understanding that your cpp source files required the cooresponding header, yet one of the libraries in my project is building fine with a number of cpp files that DO NOT include the cooresponding header. This particular cpp implements a class found in a header that has a different name and a number of other pieces of code beyond just the original class declaration.p  pHow is it that the cpp can compile functions belonging to a class that it has no knowledge of p  pCan the implementation of these functions be compiled independently and are simply called when a client application using the library and including the header with the class declaration calls the corresponding member function If this is the case, how is the implementation binary referenced by the client application I assume this is the linker...but I would love to have this cleared up.p  pI anticipate the answer may expose a misunderstanding of mine with regard to the include and compilation process, and Id really like to learn this aspect of C well.

Negative 40 pI would first like to admit that I am an extremely novice developer, so Im doing my best to give all of the relevant information to make this question answerablep  pSo Im trying to do some unit tests for NxBRE before I start attempting further work with the engine. Ive downloaded both NxBRE and NUnit version 3.2 and 2.6 respectively and Ive tested NUnit to make sure that it is working properly using a simple example that I could post here, but seems irrelevant to do so. Whats important was that I was easily able to reference the nunit.framework.dll in the example, and the tested attributes compiled and the GUI ran the tests perfectly. Im using SharpDevelop by the way.p  pI then opened up the provided NxBRE solution, which has two projects NxBRE and NxBREUnitTest, added the same reference in the UnitTest project to the nunit.framework.dll, and attempted to build the solution. I got a compiler error along with the host of associated errors stating thatp  blockquote   pCS0246 The type or namespace name nunit could not be found are you missing a using directive or an assembly referencep blockquote  pWell, I was pretty sure I wasnt missing either, so I double checked the reference, and it seemed good in that I readded it in the way that I had for my test example. I even manually copied the .dll to the directories that were being accessed. I dont think it was an issue with NUnit itself, because I went back to my crafted example and it still ran fine.p  pDo you have any suggestions for troubleshooting ideas or techniques that I should tryp

Negative 40 pI have to attend a software engineering exam this Friday, but theres a little thing I cant understand, and my teacher is unavailable for explaining.p  pI must make a project based on the BoundaryControllerEntity BCE pattern, with persistence database or sequential file, but Im going to use SQLite.

Negative 40 blockquote   pWe have already seen that spanning trees and cuts are intimately related. Here is another connection. Lets remove the last edge that Kruskals algorithm adds to the spanning tree this breaks the tree into two components, thus defining a cut S,S in the graph. What can we say about this cut Suppose the graph we were working with was unweighted, and that its edges were ordered uniformly at random for Kruskals algorithm to process them. Here is a remarkable fact with probability at least 1n2, S,S is the minimum cut in the graph, where the size of a cut S, S is the number of edges crossing between S and S. This means that repeating the process On2 times and outputting the smallest cut found yields the minimum cut in G with high probability an Omn2 log n algorithm for unweighted minimum cuts. Some further tuning gives the On2 log n minimum cut algorithm, invented by David Karger, which is the fastest known algorithm for this important problem.p blockquote  ul lipDoesnt this depend on the fact that there are n2 unique ways to process the graph through Kruskals algorithm I mean if there are emonlyem 3 unique ways for Kruskals algorithm to process a graph with 10 nodes, repeating the process n2 times will not produce n2 unique last edges. How would it work in a scenario where there are fewer than n2 unique final cuts that is less than n2 unique last edgespli lipWhat if there are fewer than n2 edges in total For example you could have a connected graph of 10 nodes with only 9 edges, meaning regardless of how many times you repeat the algorithm, you wont have n2 unique last edges. How would it work in this situationpli lipWouldnt it be easier to just loop through every edge and check if the edge is the minimum cut In a graph of n nodes, the maximum number of unique edges is n  n1  n2...  1 edges, which is less than n2. And considering n2 is less than n2 log n, why not just loop through all edges since this is fasterpli ul

Negative 40 pSuppose theres a sensor which records the date and time at every activation.

Negative 40 pI have a quick question about HTML and CSS. I thought this would be easy to track down, but its turning out to be quite the challenge.

But theres a catch, I want to be able to dynamically hide the right DIV at any time using jQuery and have the left one fill its space.

Negative 40 pI have been tasked with trying to monitor activity in all GUI programs spawned from an initial program and killing them when they become inactive for a set period of time. This cannot be system activity as we must close the programs even if the user is just using another program for a while not spawned by the initial program. The application spawning processes is a .Net program and that will not change. I was able to use codeSetWindowsHookExcode to set low level hooks codeWHKEYBOARDLLcode and codeWHMOUSELLcode from .Net but was unsure of how to associate the messages with the processes Ive started Using codeSystem.Diagnostics.Processcode. I could hook events from the application doing the hooking, but it would always fail when I tried to hook to a specific thread for a spawned program.p  pThe closest I was able to come was by creating a C dll that calls codeSetWindowsHookExcode on behalf of the .Net program. Using this method I am able to hook into the first thread of a spawned notepad.exe, but the callback function is never called. If I specify a thread id of 0 the callback is called when there is activity in the original application so I know the codeSetWindowsHookExcode works in that case.p  pI dont fully understand hooking yet, but from what I have read this will not work because the dll callback function address will be meaningless to the hooked process. Is that the issue I am running into If so, is there a way around this or can somebody please suggest an alternative to determining if a spawned process is actively being usedp  p.Net C code p  precodeprivate const int WHMOUSE  14  [DllImportTestHook.dll, EntryPointInitializeHook,  SetLastErrortrue, CharSetCharSet.Unicode, ExactSpellingtrue, CallingConventionCallingConvention.StdCall] private static extern bool InitializeHookuint hookType, int threadID  private void HookEm      ...

Negative 40 pIm right now setting up a web application based on ASP.NET MVC 3 Razor. Its going to fetch its content mainly by Ajax. The site menu is built by a mvc sitemap provider and uses Ajax.ActionLink to create and hook up the click events. Thats already working like a charm.p  pThe menu is part of a shared layout. The layout shall be used only once  when the application is being loaded into the browser also known as landing page, Index of the default controller, referred to as Home as of now. p  pThe default controller returns a view with the default layout containing the menu. In the menu there is also a link to Home. Every link in the menu aside from the link to Home is also working like a charm by now. p  pThe link to the landingpage however returns Ajax content containing another instance of the menu because it is part of its layout. p  pSo how do I distinguish between a full page request the user enters the url into the address line of the browser or clicks an external link to my Home and provide a full view and an internal ajax request and just provide a partial view of the Home page content p  pThanksp

Negative 40 pIm not concerned about the case when multiple threads try to acquire a CS. What about a case where one threads locks and unlocks a CS Im particularly interested how it works in current multicore CPUs in x86 and ARMs.p  pBased on my simple guess, I think there is a lockcount and when a thread tries to acquire a CS it does interlocked exchangeadd. Does this exchangeadd affect other coresthreads in any way For example, cores have their own memory caches am I correct and interlocked exchangeadd would need to interact with all other cores to make sure that the piece of ram isnt cached somewhere else.p  pI assume, that its better to add a CS in place that isnt going to have multiple threads to access data, than to miss a CS in place that might rarely use multiple threads. But Id like to verify that if there is a thread that entersexists for a CS in a loop, then other coresthreads wouldnt stall because of intercpu synchronization going on behind the scenes.p  pthanksp

Negative 40 pI will start by saying that this is a 2part question. I have a an activity with 3 buttons and a listview. One button opens a dialogfragment with a datepicker, and the button text displays the selected date. The other 2 buttons allow you to go to the previousnext days respectively. The ListView should show the the records that correspond to the selected date.p  pCurrently, when loading the activity, the button shows todays date and the listview shows todays records from the database. Ive managed to create a method that restarts the loader and call it within the previousnext buttons, so when navigating one day at a time, the listview updates to show the correct records, but when I change the date by calling the datepicker dialog, I cant seem to find a way to get it to update correctly  This is the first part of the question.p  pThe second part is a little harder to explain. When I select a date with 4 records 4 lines in the listview all 4 records show, but then for example, if I go to the next day which only has 2 records 2 lines in the listview it will correctly show the first 2 records, but then the next 2 rows still show the data from the previous date. To explain this better, lets assume each row in the listview shows the DB records id number. On date 1 which has 4 records I have ID 1,2,3,4 showing, but when changing to date 2 which has 2 records it shows ID 5,6,3,4.p  pI assume by incorporating a method that clears the listview contents completely and then repopulates with the new date, I can solve both issues at once.

Negative 40 pI have always run erlang applications on powerful servers. However, sometimes, you cannot avoid such memory errors, especially when users are manypre Crash dump was written to erlcrash.dump eheapalloc Cannot allocate 467078560 bytes of memory of type heap. pre What makes it more annoying is that you have a server with 20GB of RAM, with say 8 cores. Looking at the memory which erlang says, it could not allocate and that is why it crashed, is also disturbing , because it is very little memory compared to what the server has in stock.brbr My question today i wish it is not closed , is that, what Operating system configurations can be done consider RedHat , Solaris, Ubuntu or Linux in general, to make it offer the erlang VM more memory when it needs it  brbrIf one is to run an erlang application on such capable servers, what memory consideration outside erlang should be made as regards the underlying operating system  brbrbProblem Backgroundbbr Erlang consumes Main Memory, especially when processes are in thousands. I am running a Web service using codeYaws Web Servercode. On the same node, i have Mnesia running with about 3 coderamcopiescode tables. Its a notification system, as part of a larger Web application running on an intranet. Users access this very system via JSONP from the main application running off a different web server and a different hardware as well. Each user connection queries mnesia directly for any data it needs. However, as users increase i always get the codecrash dumpcode. I have tweaked the application itself as much as possible, clean up the code to standard, used more binaries than strings e.t.c. avoided single points like genservers between yaws processes and mnesia, so that each connection, just hits mnesia directly. The server is very capable with lots of RAM and Disc Space. However, my node crashes when it needs a little more memory, thats why i need to find a way of forcing the Operating system to expand more memory to erlang. Operating system is codeREDHAT ENTERPRISE 6codep

Negative 40 pIn the course of my reading I came accross a hrefhttpwww.openstd.orgjtc1sc22wg14wwwdocsdr051.htmlWG14 Defect Report 51a written in 1993 or perhaps 1893, they left off the century and millennium. In the code sample there, apparently an operator spelled codegtgtcode is used on a pointer to a codestructcode. I cant find it in any operator precedence tables Ive found, so I am wondering, is or was it ever an operator, and if so, what does or did, as the case may be this operator dop  pAt first I thought it was a typo, but it is reproduced twice more in the text and another time in the code sample in the response to the question, and I have a hard time believing it just slipped past at least two C experts without being noticed, when it jumped out at a novice like me. Its also at the focal point of the code, very easy to notice, and was never corrected.p  pHere is the code with added indentationp  precodeinclude ltstdlib.hgt  struct A      char x[1]   main      struct A p  struct A  mallocsizeofstruct A  100     pgtgtx[5]     This is the key line [for both them and us]      return 0  codepre  pI tried to compile this code with both a C and C compiler and it failed to parse in either one. Perhaps this was some operator in an early version of C that isnt used any morep  pThis feels suspiciously like the a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1642028whatisthenameofthisoperatorWhat is the name of this operator a question, but I dont think this is a combination of two other operators, I dont see how it can be divided up and be valid.p

Negative 40 pI know there are many topics and resources about this, but Im wondering about a very specific question and it might take a very long time to check all sources for a emdefiniteem answer. p  pI know that JVMDalvik guarantees that by the time you access a static field of a class except for codefinal staticcode primitive values, the static fields of the class are already initialized. Is the opposite true as well If I emneverem access a class at all e.g. because the codeswitchcasecode code in another static method never reaches a certain branch, is it guaranteed that the VM does strongnotstrong initialize statics of this classp  pAssume I have a class such as thisp  precodepublic class Boo        public static int[] anything  new int[]  2,3,4        private static int[] something  new int[]  5,6,7   this may be much bigger as well        public static final int[] getAndClear             int[] st  something            something  null            return st         codepre  pMy application is a very special one not typical in some aspects, and it may hold hundreds of classes such as codeBoocode generated by a code generator, where codesomethingcode may be an array of varying element count so it may contain very many elements as well sometimes.p  pDepending on application input, many of these pregenerated classes might never get accessed. I emdo notem want that a lot of codeint[]code objects get initialized unnecessarily, eating up much memory.p

Negative 40 pIs it a common practice to create an HTTP POST end point with the header applicationxwwwformurlencoded that takes in a JSON string as the value of the keyvalue POST data instead of having a list of fields as the POST data Regardless of being common or not, is it considered bad since it requires more work to stringify the fields into a JSON stringp  pExample userusernamebob, age1 vs usernamebobampage1 in the POST form data.p

If you have any questions or need clarification, please let me know.p
Negative 40 pI am reading the syntax for using a hrefhttpdojotoolkit.orgdocumentationtutorials1.8declare relnofollowdojos declarea for class creation.  The description is confusingp  precodeThe declare function is defined in the dojobasedeclare module. declare accepts three arguments className, superClass, and properties. ClassName  The className argument represents the name of the class, including the namespace, to be created. Named classes are placed within the global scope. The className can also represent the inheritance chain via the namespace. Named Class   Create a new class named mynamespace.MyClass declaremynamespace.MyClass, null,        Custom properties and methods here    A class named mynamespace.MyClass is now globally available within the application.  Named classes should only be created if they will be used with the Dojo parser. All other classes should omit the className parameter. Anonymous Class   Create a scoped, anonymous class var MyClass  declarenull,        Custom properties and methods here    The MyClass is now only available within its given scope. SuperClasses  The SuperClass argument can be null, one existing class, or an array of existing classes. If a new class inherits from more than one class, the first class in the list will be the base prototype, the rest will be considered mixins. Class with No Inheritance  var MyClass  declarenull,        Custom properties and methods here    null signifies that this class has no classes to inherit from. Class Inheriting from Another Class  var MySubClass  declareMyClass,        MySubClass now has all of MyClasss properties and methods      These properties and methods override parents   codepre  pThe syntax is exactly the same for creating a nonnamed class and a class with no superclassp  precodevar MyClass  declarenull,       Custom properties and methods here    codepre  pI expect the syntax for a class without any super class and without any name to be like thisp  precodevar MyClass  declarenull, null,       Custom properties and methods here    codepre  pI am coming from a typed language background, so perhaps Ive misunderstood how this works in JavaScript.  I fail to understand how someone reading the code without any comments would know the difference between the two, if the tutorials syntax is correct.p  pI would have expected the syntax to be something like thisp  precodeclass without a name declarenull, SuperClass,   class without a name or super class declarenull, null,   class with a name but no super class declareClassName, null,  codepre  pMaybe this is verbose, but at least it is easy to tell what each parameter is for.p

Negative 40 pIm developing a SPA application where Backbone.js is the main piece of the architecture.p  pWe also have some Twitter Bootstrap flavor among which we have Button groups[1].

I mixin the behavior I need in Backbone.View so the specious JavaScript is injected in an unobstrusive way.p  pSo Im telling those buttons that they are not buttons anymore.

Negative 40 pSay I have a user list and an id is associated with each row. There is an edit button associated with each row. Upon clicking the edit button, I want to display the user information. Right now I am passing the id as paramater in the url. I want to avoid that for security reasons, as not all ids should be viewed by all. I am thinking I should be able to set a session variable on the click of edit button so that when my view loads, it can get the id to load from the session. Any idea how to set the session variable when the edit button is clicked. Is there is better alternativep  pThanks in advance. SKp

Negative 40 pI have an application which uses slf4j as the logging facade. Now I would like to intercept all the error messages before the transfer is handed out to the underlying logging system. Is it possible to do that for slf4j I looked through the documentation and see that we can change the Appenders in the implementation like log4j to achieve this but can we do this at the facade level itself The intercept does basic stuff like incrementing a global counter for the number of error messages etc.p

Negative 40 pIm trying to load an embedded swf which acts as a sound library. Since its a large swf I want to load it at runtime and have a loaderbar indicate how much is loaded.p  pDoing some research online I found that using codemimeTypeapplicationoctetstreamcode would be the way to do this.  The result however is that the embedded swf is still loaded at the same time the mainwrapper swf is loading. So for some reason the entire embedded swf is already loaded when I get to the first line of code in this case the LoadTest constructor.

Negative 40 pIve looked through Tastypies documentation and searched for a while, but cant seem to find an answer to this.p  pLets say that weve got two models codeStudentcode and codeAssignmentcode, with a onetomany relationship between them. The codeAssignmentcode model includes an codeassignmentdatecode field. Basically, Id like to build an API using Tastypie that returns codeStudentcode objects strongsorted by most recent assignment datestrong. Whether the sorting is done on the server or in the client side doesnt matter  but wherever the sorting is done, the codeassignmentdatecode is needed to sort by.p  pIdea 1 just return the assignments along with the students.p  precodeclass StudentResourceModelResource     assignments  fields.OneToManyField         AssignmentResource, assignments, fullTrue      class Meta         queryset  models.Student.objects.all         resourcename  student codepre  pUnfortunately, each student may have tens or hundreds of assignments, so this is bloated and unnecessary.p  pIdea 2 augment the data during the dehydrate cycle.p  precodeclass StudentResourceModelResource         class Meta         queryset  models.Student.objects.all         resourcename  student      def dehydrateself, bundle         bundle.data[lastassignmentdate]  models.Assignment             .filterstudentbundle.data[id]             .orderbyassignmentdate[0].assignmentdate codepre  pThis is not ideal, since itll be performing a separate database roundtrip for each student record. Its also not very declarative, nor elegant.p  pSo, is there a good way to get this kind of functionality with Tastypie Or is there a better way to do what Im trying to achievep

Negative 40 pI made a working program for LPC1857 which enables interrupts and each systick interrupt then calls some function. It works perfectly with LPC1857. When I try to run the same program on LPC1850 the program execution jumps to 0xFFFFFFFE and stops whenever the interrupt occurs. The function called in the SystickHandler never gets called. It looks like the program gets wrong address for the handler, but I dont understand how that could be. LR points to 0xFFFFFFF9 when that happens. Both of the addresses are reserved.p  pI changed the linker file the only difference from LPC1857 project besides the initialization of some unrelated ports for LPC1850 and it looks like thisp  precodeENTRYstart                      INPUTamp amp   MEMORY      FLASH rx  ORIGIN  0x1C000000, LENGTH  16M     SRAM rwx  ORIGIN  0x10000000, LENGTH  64K   SECTIONS      .text               text  .

Negative 40 pCould you please tell me how you I might structure the following tableclasses to avoid circular references I have the following defined in a Bachelor degree classp  precodeEntity public class Bachelor  ...

If the applicant specifies theyve completed a bachelor degree they can then specify one or more prior and exchange studies. An example of a bachelor degree plus one prior degree results is the followingp  pre bachelor  id          fkbachelor  10003       10000 pre  pre study  id          title               fkprior  10000       Bachelor of Arts    10001       Prior Degree        10003 pre  pThis seems to work fine except if I need to delete items from the tables. I also received a warning about having circular references from the compiler. So I cant first delete from Bachelor because Study references it by fkprior, and I cant first delete from Study because Bachelor references it. Im guessing this isnt good practice to structure it like this.p

Negative 40 pI think we have gone slightly wrong on the way we have used Azure storage in a SAAS system. We created a storage account per client Securtiy was prime consideration and containers per system area e.g. Vehicle, Work etcp  pHaving done further reading it seems a suggestion would be that we should have used one account for all clients. Each client should have a container so we can programmatically create it which we then secure. Then files should just be structured using virtual folder structure e.g. Container called Client A. Then Files for the Jobs in Work area of system stored like WorkJobsentity idblah.pdf. Does this sound sensiblep  pIf so we now have about 10 accounts that we need to restructure. Are there any tools that will let us easily copy one accounts contents to another containers account I appreciate we probably cant move the files between accounts as we set them up ages ago so cant use native copy function so I guess some sort of copy. There are GB of files across all the accounts.p

Negative 40 pI have been creating a Java program to encode a message received from the user. Just for some background into how it does this It is supposed to get the input, split it into characters, then get a set of random numbers from Random.org true random number generator equal to the length of the message and then shift the characters of the input by their corresponding shift, or random number, then output the coded message and the shifts. So far I have gotten input, converted it into a string array, checked the quota Random.org has a quota and gotten the random numbers. I am getting this error when trying to output the converted shifts from Strings gotten at the website to ints, I think it is because of a CRLF on the last number I tried using a regex to fix this, but it didnt work.

Negative 40 pI started to write some unit test for an app in zend framework. Looking around I came to the PHPunit and then to the ZendTest which in turn extends the PHPunit.p  pSo I opted to write tests with ZendTest since it gives me some zend framework specific assertions...p  pAll went fine until I had to check in a test the response headers... My intuition was to use the codethisgtassertHeaderheaderNameToCheckIfItExistscode assertion. Unfortunately it strongfailedstrong. So I started to look around why it fails... I checked that my application sets the header in the response and it sets it correctly and after that I checked with codecurlcode the raw response Http headers. It appears that the setted header by the application is present in the responsep  pemSo what is the problememp  pThe problem is that in zend application the headers can be set with codethisgtsetHeaderheaderName, headerValuecode method as well as with codethisgtsetRawHeaderheaderNameAndHeaderValuecode method. There is also the codethisgtgetHeaderscode and the codethisgtgetRawHeaderscode to get the headers as an array of key value pair or as an array of plain string, respectively. Looking in the source code I discovered that there are 2 distinct arrays of headers  one with key value elements and other with plain string elementsp  pIn my app I used the codethisgtsetRawHeaderheaderNameAndHeaderValuecode and the codethisgtassertHeaderheaderNameToCheckIfItExistscode fails. If I use codethisgtsetHeaderheaderName, headerValuecode the codethisgtassertHeaderheaderNameToCheckIfItExistscode does not fail...p  pSo it appears that the codethisgtassertHeaderheaderNameToCheckIfItExistscode checks if the codeheaderNameToCheckIfItExistscode header name exists by looking only in the codethisgtgetResponsegtgetHeaderscodep  pPlease, if some one knows something about this drawback answer at this post.p  pThe workaround I made is to overload the codethisgtassertHeaderheaderNameToCheckIfItExistscode in my test case filep  precodepublic function assertHeaderheader, message      allheaders  array     foreach thisgtgetResponsegtgetRawHeaders as str          components  explode, str         allheaders[]  arrayname gt components[0],                 value gt trimcomponents[1],                 replace gt false          allheaders  arraymergeallheaders, thisgtgetResponsegtgetHeaders      foreach allheaders as h          if h[name]  header             return thisgtassertTruetrue, message      thisgtfailno header with name .header      codepre  pMy zend framework versionp  precodezf show version Zend Framework Version 1.10.6 codepre

Negative 40 pI currently develop a Web application that can be accessed over HTTP by an Android application or a Web browser. Both user agents basically provide the same functionalities. The Android app calls RESTful Web Services built with JAXRSJersey, while Web pages are Facelets backed by JSF managed beans.  I thus consider that there are two types of possible entry points to the Web app. The Web services do all the necessary work accessing the resources, performing the database operations within DAOs, etc. and most importantly, they must act on their own. Therefore, they constitute an independent layer.p  pstrongIn order to reuse the code, is it a good practice to call a Web service from a managed bean Are their life cycle compatiblestrongp  pThe idea is to inject the Resource object into the managed bean with CDI, but not necessarily and to call its methods strongprogrammaticallystrong. The Web service would act as a business delegate  to the underlying services.p  pI widely googled the question but I didnt get a clear answer. I saw some pieces of code where the managed bean invokes a Web service with its URL, but since all my components are located in a single server app, I dont see what prevents me from linking them emdirectlyem.p  pSubsidiary question on error handling I am also annoyed with the idea of catching WebApplicationExceptions from the Web service into my managed bean for returning error messages back to the view with FacesMessage. My father always told me that I should never catch runtime exceptions...So, is there a good way to handle them correctly   p

Negative 40 pI am generating quite a lot of Alloys specifications .als files. For a mediumsize problem I am trying to solve, I generated 1536 .als files.

The good news is, I always managed to run those 1536 commands, usually after several attempts. The bad news is that I usually end up freezing my PC i.e having up to 4 cores running up to 100 after all these Alloy commands have completed Note that my program an Eclipse plugin does not terminate at this point and continues executing.

Negative 40 pI have been asked to implement a div mouseover transition as it is in USAToday at time of writing.p  pBasically the web site has some boxes with this structurep  precodeltdiv classassetgt    ltdiv classfrontgtimage and some textltdigt    ltdiv classbackgtsome other textltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pAt page loading only the front divs are shown.

Negative 40 pMy ASP.net MVC Application contains a DevExpress DateEdit extension, with that Im able to choose the date a hrefhttpmvc.devexpress.comEditorsDateEdit relnofollowhttpmvc.devexpress.comEditorsDateEdita, now I like to send, every time the user changes the date, the date back to the controller by reacting on the handler of my DateEdit extension.p  pI set ClientSideEvents.DateChanged on a javascript function and now my questions starts, usually I send data with a form and a submit back to the controller and the binder binds them to my model...p  pbut now I would like to call in the javascript function a method on my controller like writeDateDateTime date, a ActionLink would probably do the trick, because I know that it is possible to call the controller by a link like myControllerMethodParameters, but I do not know how to realize that without an action of the user.p  pMy Codep  precodeHtml.DevExpress.DateEditsettings gt                                              settings.Name  Date                         settings.Properties.UseMaskBehavior  true                         settings.Properties.EditFormat  EditFormat.Custom                         settings.Properties.EditFormatString  MMMM dd, yyyy                         settings.Properties.DisplayFormatString  MMMM dd, yyyy                         settings.Date  DateTime.Now                         settings.Properties.ClientSideEvents.DateChanged  OnDateChanged                     .GetHtml                 Html.DevExpress.Buttonsettings gt                      settings.Name  sendDate                     settings.ClientVisible  false                     settings.UseSubmitBehavior  true                   function OnDateChangeds, e       Call Controller   [HttpPost, ValidateInputfalse]     public ActionResult onDateChangedDateTime date               Do something      codepre  pSo I think my general question is how do I pass data to the controller without a form and only by reacting on a client side event  p
Negative 40 pIm trying to jump through some hoops at the moment in dealing with WPFs codeSizeChangedcode event on a Window. I have some custom code that I need executed strongafterstrong a user completes resizing the window, unfortunately there is no event that I have been able to come across for this so I have created a solution using Reactive Extensions to throttle the SizeChange eventsp  precodeIObservableltSizeChangedEventArgsgt ObservableSizeChanges  Observable     .FromEventPatternltSizeChangedEventArgsgtthis, SizeChanged     .Selectx gt x.EventArgs     .ThrottleTimeSpan.FromMilliseconds200  IDisposable SizeChangedSubscription  ObservableSizeChanges     .ObserveOnSynchronizationContext.Current     .Subscribex gt          SizeChangedx      codepre  pBasically what this does is ensures that 200 milliseconds of no SizeChanged events must pass before it will call my custom code. This works fine however I have run into a problem that if the user drags the window handle out and continues to hold the mouse button down the code will still be executed. I want to be able to make sure that the custom code strongcannotstrong be executed while the mouse button is down. I tried plugging into codePreviewMouseLeftButtonDowncode but it is not fired when the window handle is clicked, only when the mouse is clicked inside the windows frame. Is there any similar event I can plug into for a mouse down that applies to the window handle Or can anyone think of a suitable workaround for the problem that Im havingp

Negative 40 pSo I worked on an iPhone game several years ago that uses CGPointMake calls hundreds of times for some OpenGL stuff. That was back when 480 was the only size for landscape phones, but now Id like to support the 568 point size display. The problem is things arent centered now and theres this big empty black vertical bar on the right side of the screenp  pI was wondering what the best way to fill the screen again would be without rewriting these hundreds of CGPoint calls. I was thinking if I could overload CGPointMake somehow to offset each one by 44,0 it would help to center things. Or maybe theres a way with OpenGL to shift everything in one direction Im not overly familiar with OpenGL so Im not sure where the best place to start would be  any help is greatly appreciatedp

Negative 40 pI have a production db that Id like to copy to dev.

Negative 40 pI have been using ANTLR with Eclipse for some time using the ANTLRv3IDE plugin. While it is not perfect, and a bit outdated, it does its job reasonably well.p  pNow I am looking to switch to ANTLRv4 for another DSL that I am creating. However, Eclipse support seems to be extremely thin. I decided to try out ANTLRWorks, which is a NetBeans plugin, but I could not get it to install it seems to be locked to specific dated versions 201302132200 while I have something newer, still 7.3 as docs say of dependencies.p  pSo, the question Has anyone set up emanyem Java IDE preferably Eclipse, but I could be persuaded to switch if support is good for something else to integrate with ANTLR With integrate, I mean code generate on savekeyboard shortcut and syntax coloring at the very least. Code completion and other features are of course nice to have, but I could live without them for now.p  pI am well aware of Xtext and I have had great success using it for some projects, but unfortunately it does not fit the needs here need no IDE support, need my own DSL model not based on ECore, etc.p  pI know ANTLRWorks can be run as a standalone application without a Java IDE, but that I consider to be a lastresort solution as it is extremely cumbersome to work this way switch between application, files out of sync, no VCS support etc. I tried the other way around to install the Java parts into ANTLRworks which itself is a NetBeans distro, but it did not end well it seems basic project support etc was stripped out of ANTLRworks.p

Negative 40 pIn my java program I query a database and get a resultset. The fields retrieved are as followsp  ul liserveridli lithreatlevelli liclientidli linumofattacksli ul  pwhere each record represents an attack from a certain IP. I do not need the IP but would like to know the total number of attacks on a specific server to plot along an x axis based on threatlevel, and also the total number of attacks on ALL servers for a specific client to organize along a y axis in descending order.p  pAfter the query, I then store the fields of the resultset into a hashmap of objects with the key being serverid after checking the hashmap if that key already exists if it does then the total number of attacks is updated. By doing this I am able to take repeating records of servers, keep it as one object, and just total the field called numofattacks. Now my next step is the final step to organizing the data to allow me to graph it but I am unsure of the correct approach due to my inexperience. My database mind is telling me to create another type of list or collection with the fields clientid and totalnumattacks, where clientid is the key and totalnumattacks represents the sum of all attacks on all servers for that client, and this can somehow be linked to the hashmap of servers through the clientid. So clientid is the primary key in one set and a foreign key in another which will allow me to first organize the clients, and then plot their servers. p  pMy question is, is this possible Ive looked into LinkedLists but Im not sure if it could completely meet my needs. Is there another data structure better suited for my needsp

Negative 40 pI am using JDBCRealm to do authentication and authorization in my web app. In regard to authentication, I am using FORM with jsecuritycheck service. I have configured everything including a HTTP Status 403 error page where the user is going to be redirected if heshe does not have the required permissions to access a resource. Up to this far, everything is working fine. The problem comes in when a HTTP Status 403 error is returned. It seems to me that despite the user not having been authorized, a JSF session is still created for this user as long as heshe has been successfully authenticated. Now when I try going back to the login page and enter the password and username of a user who has permission to access the resource, it fails to authorize because authorization is still being applied to the user holding the current session who apparently does not have the required permission. Now what I need to know is how to destroy or invalidate such a session created when a HTTP Status 403 is returned. thanks  p  pUPDATE I think its important to mention that when the session is timed out, I am now able to login user who has the required permissions. just a tip...p

For example Product code1code has 6 different combinations 3 colors  2 materials and Product code2code only has 3 different combination 3 sizes  1. p  pIve thought about storing the combinations as a text, i.ep  precode  productid  combination      price  SKU     1           redwool         50.00  A121   1           redpolyester    50.00  A122   1           bluewool        50.00  A123   1           bluepolyester   50.00  A124   1           greenwool       50.00  A125   1           greenpolyester  50.00  A125   2           small            4.00   CD12   2           medium           4.00   CD13   2           large            3.50   CD14   codepre  pBut there must be a better, normalized, way of representing this data.  Hypothetical situation I want to be able to search for a blue product that is less than 10. With the above database structure it is not possible to do without parsing the text and that is something I want to avoid.p  pAny helpsuggestions are appreciated p

Why is that an issue Hasnt Ruby tried to be only backward compatible That is, if code written in Ruby 2.0 can be parsed by Ruby 2.1 interpreter, isnt that enough Why does code written in Ruby 2.1 have to be parsable by Ruby 2.0 interpreterp

Negative 40 pI want to merge two lists in python, with the lists being of different lengths, so that the elements of the shorter list are as equally spaced within the final list as possible. i.e. I want to take code[1, 2, 3, 4]code and code[a,b]code and merge them to get a list similar to code[1, a, 2, 3, b, 4]code. It needs to be able to function with lists that arent exact multiples too, so it could take code[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]code and code[a, b, c]code and produce code[1, a, 2, b, 3, c, 4, 5]code or similar. It needs to preserve the ordering of both lists.p  pI can see how to do this by a longwinded brute force method but since Python seems to have a vast array of excellent tools to do all sorts of clever things which I dont know about yet I wondered whether theres anything more elegant I can usep  pNB Im using Python 3.3.p

Negative 40 pIm using Google App Engines datastore and looking for a design solution for like functionality for users status similair to facebook likesp  pIve gone through the Sharding Counters concepts a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comappenginearticlesshardingcounters relnofollowhttpsdevelopers.google.comappenginearticlesshardingcountersa and found its good and suitable for counting number of likes where you can increment or decrement the count.

So I tried the same sharding concepts to store userIds but facing the below issues,  first of all is it good to shard userId list like count  If so when the user dislike it, I have remove the user id from shared list. To achieve this I need to traverse all the sharded datastore and do a userId check and removep  pAny suggestions on this or alternative solutions to achieve itp  pThanksp

Negative 40 pI am creating an app that shows a moving picture on top of camera preview. And the way I am doing it is adding two SurfaceView, one holding camera preview and one holding my moving picture, in a framelayout inside my main activity. So basically there are three public classes, and one inner thread class inside the moving picture class to control the animation.p  pIt worked fine upon starting the app  camera is previewing and picture is moving. But then strongif I pause the activity, by going to home screen or by redirecting into another activity with clicking the picture, and resume, the camera preview would black out.strong The wierd part is if I rotate the phone into a different mode landscapeportrait, thing comes back to normal.p  pIve read several post about camera not resuming, but the solutions were all about opening camera. Im pretty much sure my problem is not about the camera instance after examining. And actually if I pause activity by going to home screen, when I resume the camera would appear for a second and then black out.p  pIve been trying all kinds of things including removing all views from my layout in OnPause and specifying index number when adding the views. But the only method that kind of got a little progress was when I comment out the canvas lock in the following block. Without the lock, the picture would move randomly, but camera could resume and all. In fact, if I leave out all things about thread and just display a static picture, camera works fine too.

As I use both R and Stata I will frame the question for both with some madeup data.p  pStatap  precode    tabi 1 13 3 27 46  25 0 2 5 3  22 2 0 3 0  19 34 3 8 1 , exact10 codepre  pYou can increase codeexactcode to 1000 max but it will take maybe a day before returning an error.p  pRp  precode    Job lt matrixc1,13,3,27,46, 25,0,2,5,3, 22,2,0,3,0, 19,34,3,8,1, 4, 5,          dimnames  listincome  clt 15k, 1525k, 2540k, gt40k,          satisfaction  cVeryD, LittleD, ModerateS, VeryS, exstatic     fisher.testJob codepre  pFor me, at least, it errors out on both programs. So the question is how to do this calculation on either Stata or Rp  pOriginal Question I have Stata and R to play with. I have a dataset with various categorical variables, some of which have multiple categories. Therefore Id like to do Fishers exact test with more than 2 x 2 categories i.e. apply Fishers to a 2 x 6 table or a 4 x 4 table.p  pCan this be done with either R or Stata p  pEdit whilst this can be done in Stata  it will not work for my dataset as I have too many categories. Stata goes through endless iterations and even being left for a day or more does not produce a solution.p  pMy question is really   can R do this, and can it do it quickly p

Negative 40 pI am trying to get my head around GWT Activities and Places. And I am not sure how to implement a specific functionnality.p  pLets assume here that I am also using MVP, and that my Activities are my Presenters.p  pSay I have an activity lets call it activity A and its corresponding view that is displaying a list of customers. The user can click on a create customer button in the view. p  pWhat I want to do is this I want a create customer dialog to pop up emon topem of the current activity when the user clicks on the button. I also want all logic related to said dialog to be separated, so it can be reused later.p  pFor example, the same dialog could be reused in a create invoice activity. So the user could click a similar create customer button in the create invoice activity, and be presented with the same dialog as used earlier.p  pNow, if I understand it correctly, I do not want to goTo a new place, since it would terminate the current activity list customers or create invoice.p  pI have thought about defining a CreateCustomerPresenter and a CreateCustomerDialog which would be the corresponding view, and having my list customerscreate invoice Activities reminder they also are my Presenters extend the CreateCustomerPresenter, but I dont know if it would be a wise idea...p  pWhat is the recommended way of reusing logicview associated with a dialog in the context of an activityp

Negative 40 pIm working on a FlaskSQLAlchemy project and Ive implemented a nice JSON serialization method that applies to my SQLAlchemy models. After querying the DB, I can then easily present that data via a REST API. When Im using codesecondarycode tables for manytomany relationships, those tables are instances of codedb.Tablecode, like sop  precodeelectionsvoters  db.Table     electionsvoters,     db.metadata,     db.Columnelectionid, db.Integer, db.ForeignKeyelections.id, primarykeyTrue,     db.Columnuserid, db.Integer, db.ForeignKeyusers.id, primarykeyTrue,   class ElectionMyModel     tablename  elections      id  db.Columndb.Integer, db.Sequenceelectionidseq, autoincrementTrue, primarykeyTrue     name  db.Columndb.Unicode255     voters  db.relationshipUser, secondaryelectionsvoters, backrefelectionsVoting codepre  pLets say I wanted an API that presented just a list of voters for a particular election. Id do something like codeElection.query.getor404electionidcode, then return codeelection.voters.mycustomserializecode, as codevoterscode would be populated by SQLAlchemy. However, its not an instance of codedb.Modelcode like its parent, so I cant use my serializing method on that child.p  pIs there a way to set up my models such that the codeelectionsvoterscode secondary table is a full instance of codedb.Modelcode rather than just codedb.Tablecode, and is that wise My serialization method needs access to the column names, which is why I havent just split it out into a standalone method.p

Negative 40 pi implemented an abstract factory pattern, but i am facing a situation where i would need my product to also be a Factory Manager.p  pWhat i mean is that some of my product can also be parents of other product, like it is in many situation.p  pLets say i have a Company, which also have Employeesperson, and that we can take notes about the company, the person, or whatever. Then it would look like thisp  pClient  CompanyFactory  Company Product  PersonFactory  Person Product  NoteFactory  Note Product, etc...p  pWould it be a bad practice to have a product be a manager of factories and maintain collections of other product using the Abstract Factory Pattern in a somewhat complex hierarchyp  pWhy am i trying to implement this pattern is to help our development team, hide implementation, set rules and avoid big ball of Spaghetti code as much as possible.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 40 pOkay, before I post this question, I know for sure there are these socalled pros in this community accusing me of premature optimization. Let me be clear I want to be sure what I am exactly writing, even if it is such a nuance at stack level inside a function. I have a multidimensional array, and I know that in order to access the data, you need to access these index variables and then the arrays themselves, taking up a lot of time. So I did thisp  precode char ref  gdata.mapnames[game.maptype][game.map]  sizet a  strlenref  4  ref[a]  0  strcpytemppath, ref  ref[a]  . codepre  pI wrapped the multidimensional array up in a simple local variable functioning as a pointer. Since I have to access the same array multiple times, could this method save up lookup time and therefore runtime speed In theory of course, since nowadays the processors are so fast you wont see any difference, unless I write bigger apps needing this. Multidimensional arrays arent bad habits rightp
Negative 40 pI have this assemble.io subtaskp  precodedocs    files lt site.tmp gt [lt site.pages gt.html]  , codepre  pIf there is no matching content, it complains, saying Warning Source files not found. Use force to continue. The task then aborts. I dont mind the warning but I would like the option to configure the task to continue rather than having to use force on the command line. Is this possiblep  pps. The reason why this task is now failing is that I have converted the content to markdown. I am trying to build a scaffold that allows users to use markdown, hbs or html in any combination.p
Negative 40 pI have an executable file that opens a command prompt and connects to an FTP.  We use this to download and upload files by manually typing the codegetcode and codeputcode commands into the command window.

Ive tried calling the executable in a batch file followed by the ftp commands but it waits for the executable to exit before it runs the next command in the batch file.p  pcodeCMyFtp.exe get FtpFile.txt CtempMyFile.txt timeout t 5codep  pJust to illustrate, if I open the batch file above, I want it to execute the codegetcode command inside of the codeMyFtp.execode executable.

Negative 40 pIm using Zend Framework for PHP and handling sessions with the ZendSession module. I noticed that there was a high number of session files being created, even though Im pretty much the only one using it during development. There are currently two Zend sites running on the same server, so I decided to change the session file location temporary to another directory to only see the files created by my site.p  pIm noticing that every minute, a new session file is being created, no matter what I do. Even when I log out or close the browser, there is still always one created every minute, at the moment, always exactly 11 seconds after the minute. When I do navigate my site and use features, 1 or 2 other session files get created which is normal.p  pBefore I changed the location of the session files, at times the number of session files would increase by like 5 almost every few seconds, going from a total of like 200 session files to sometimes around 3 thousand. I have no idea if this is normal behavior for Zend or not, but I find it very strange.p  pIf anyone can help, it would be greatly appreciated.

Negative 40 pIm having a really weird bug in my HTML5 script. I wrote a sharepoint app completely in OData which uses a few HTML 5 webworker to do the number crunching in the background.

The script still works as intended on FF and Chrome, but hangs on IE.p  pIn my network view I see a request for the Worker.js file, but with a 304 NOT MODIFIED response. IE then just hangs there on that request with a status of Pending. This issue only gets resolved when I clear my browser cache.p  pI correctly close all my threads with self.close.p  pAny idea what the issue could be Im not sure if its a code issue, a browser issue or a server side issue but I can replicate the bug on Sharepoint online as well as on a local server. The whole project is JS only, so I cant modify headers as a workaround either.p  pUPDATE I ran exactly the same code outside of a sharepoint environment, and it worked perfectly. Issue is Sharepoint related.p

Negative 40 pOn my symfony app, the time has come to add mailer functionality.  Im always aware that that some new functionality justifiably goes into its own bundle.  right now i want to add some mailer functionality so a user can check off some options, then send the items to a friend. p  pthinking ahead, i might also use that functionality in another bundle in this same app, which is a different part of the website.  p  pso im thinking, i might want to put an email controller in its own bundle, but i know the swiftmailer bundle is already doing this, which i will be using.     p  pso in the end im thinking its probably only a few lines of code i will need, and that may be best placed on the controllers of the specific parts of the website i need the email functionality on.  p  pnow comes the main reason i thought of making it its own bundle, twig templates for the email bodys.  do i want these templates dangling around in my other bundles  i guess it would make sense.  p  pany suggestionsp

With this I would expect that if my vertex shader transforms a coordinate with a Yvalue of 0.0f using the above projection matrix for SVPosition, it would be drawn to the top row of the texture. A coordinate with a Yvalue of 127.0f would be drawn to the bottom row of the texture.p  pHowever, after giving it data that I would expect to fill the entire texture Im drawing many vertices as a point list, the bottom row of my texture is blank. And I notice the top row of my texture doesnt appear to contain the vertices I expect it to. It seems like everything is shifted up a row or a partial row.p  pI have read the page on the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopcc30804928vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowDirectX 10 Coordinate Systema, but I must not be fully understanding this.

Negative 40 pI recently came across this question and have not been able to find a solution to it. I hope I will get a convincing answer here. p  pQuestion  Let A be a non abstract class which is extended separately by two classes B and C. Now the task is to allow only one instance of the these classes to be created. If the client code tries to create a second instance of any of these classes, then an exception should be thrown. p  precodeA obj11  new A  Fine.  A obj12  new A  thrown an exception.   B obj21  new B  OR   A obj21  new B  both these should be fine codepre  pBut shouldnt allow 2nd instance of class B to be created. p  pThanks in advance. p  pP.S.  This is different from singleton.p

Negative 40 pIve got a spreadsheet of about 5000 user events associated with IPs, and Im trying to use IP to determine location using just an Excel formula. The IPs in my log are structured as a hrefhttpwww.tldp.orgHOWTOarchivedIPSubnetworking3.html relnofollowdotted quadsa decimal notation.p  pI figured VLOOKUP is the way to go here, so I downloaded a hrefhttpsoftware77.netgeoip relnofollowWEBNet77s IPV4 IpToCountry databasea, which seems like a comprehensive and uptodate resource is there a better resource out there for this purpose. The database includes about 140K rows of IP ranges, with the sheet structured like sop  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comgUJiH.png altIP address lookupp  pColum labels A  G are, respectively IP FROM, IP TO, REGISTRY, ASSIGNED, CTRY, CNTRY, COUNTRY.p  pNotice, a problem columns A to B represent a range of IPs, but they are in the long format I didnt realize this at first. So, before using these values as a reference, Ill have to convert my dotted quads.

Negative 40 pI have this Play app that connects to a distant server in order to consume a given API. In order to load balance my requests to the distant server, I connect multiple accounts to that same server. Each account can query the API a given number of times. Each account is handled by an Akka actor and these actors are behind an Akka Round Robin router. Thus when wanting to consume the distant API, I ask the RR router for the wanted info.p  pThis implementation runs fine until, one account gets disconnected. Basically, when one account is disconnected, the actor returns a given object that says something was wrong with the connection, and then I send a second request to the RR router again to be handled by another account.p  pMy question is, instead of having to have the retry logic outside the routerroutee group, is there a way to do it inside I am thinking that for example at router level, define a logic that handles these something was wrong with the connection messages by automatically forwarding the request to the next routee to be handled by it, and only return a final response once all routees have been tried and none workedp  pDoes Akka provide a simple way of achieving this or should I just carry on with my implementationp

Negative 40 pAs part of my data analysis on time series, I am checking for correlation between logreturns and realized volatility.p  pMy data consists of time series spanning several years for around hundred different companies large zoo object, 2 MB filesize.

Negative 40 pI want to know how to handle very large DBs in iOSp  pExplanationp  pI am making an app for the company, it will be holding all daily transactions and operations this means strongfew hundreds to a couple thousands a daystrong. The app in fact just displays the daily transactions, but keeps everything in the DB just in case so I can not delete them.p  pAs there is a need for the app to be highly reactive, I am searching for a way to efficiently load Core Data Fetch just the latest operations, without being slowed down in the long run when the DB gets really large. Knowing that emwheneverem an operation is updated, I emrefreshem the displayed table immediately.p  pI cant find any article dealing with this on iOS, so I cant find any good practice or a correct way to handle it.p  pOn a MySQL server, Id do like this  Set up a DB for daily active operations, when done, delete them and move them to a finished operations DB.  Set up a Cron job to dumpbackup dailymonthly DBs by night, and having a fresh lightweight one for the next day.p  pSadly, it doesnt seem possible to create a dynamic table on iOS, and even creating a finished DB, this will still require accessing a heavy DB at each closed operation, which can lead to a low memory crash.p

Now I want to fill a new array with the range between those numbers and keep the respectiveness of the values so as in the example codenewarray[0]  rangestartrange[0],endrange[0]code.p  pIn the moment I am using this code herep  precodefor i0 iltsizeofstartrange i      newarray[]  rangestartrange[i], endrange[i]  codepre  pBut my problem is that it generates arrays with the same data because it loops through the size of the array.

Then on form submit the ngloginform can call the callback with the input data.p  pThis will work too but I dont think that this is a good approach.p

Negative 40 pI know that a child state  controller can wait for needed async results by adding a promise object to the the resolve object in its state description object. But using this means that the decision of what is required for the state is made before the controller runs. where in my case I need to apply logic to decide if I need any async data at all or not and what this data should be.  I also understand that I can put this logic in a service but this would mean moving all the logic from the controller to a corresponding service [which IS an option but feels wrong]. p  pIn my scenario I would like a parent state to be able to postpone the execution flow and not have his child state controllers execute until it finished preparing some content for them.p  pSetting up a promise on the scope and waiting for it on the child state would work only if the child state itself does not have child states of its own [because in this pattern the child controller DOES execute and the execution would continue to its decedent states where again I would again have to add a promise to make them actually run their code when the promise is resolved].p  pI also know that I could probably catch the next codeStateChangeStartedcode event, set codeevent.preventDefaulttruecode and later on use codeurlRouter.synccode it the resolve of the promise on the parent state. but it feels rather awkward to do so.p  pI would like to be able to do something like codeurlRouter.pausecode [no such API is available at the time of writing the Q]  to prevent the router from continuing and then being able to call codeurlRouter.synccode. p  pWhat would be the Angular way way to conditionally pause the execution of child states controllers until some async results are resolved by a parent state p

Negative 40 pI have been searching for a string library or set of tools which do not store strings on the heap, but only on the stack all are known for size etc at compiletime, but contents might vary. p  pI am not looking for char arrays, because I want to ensure typesafety boundary checks etc. Could you think of a library which does some not all  that would be impossible of the functions from the original stdstring libraryp  pAs I am working on a C project for embedded systems with very little memory  lt256 kb flash, I cannot use any std references, as they tend to include exceptions and references to other std libraries.p  pAn other reason why i dont want to use the stdstring library is that I do not want the available memory to fragment, hence the fixed length.p

Ive tried to put it into a variable and send that variable into the table, but it returns that variable as null. Since my table doesnt want a null value, it rejected it and therefore didnt create the transaction. p  pIve manually inserted into P2.Account with test values and it worked, outputting the correct values. So can anyone direct me to a source that can help me input A into the insert without it changing into null This may be my only issue.p

Negative 40 pI am looking at some intercompany accounts receivables AR data. Lets assume, I have a couple companies that have transactions with each other. All but one of those companies use the same accounting system where I can retrieve the data from. For the odd one out company, I do not have access to AR data of intercompany transactions. As a proxy, I take the accounts payables AP data from the other companies. My aim is to prepare a report showing the total AR data for all companies built from the AR data of the of companies on the central accounting system and of the AP data that those companies have booked against the one companyp  pI now have three tables in Powerpivot, table AR holding AR data company code, AR account numbers and the amount and table AP holding accounts payable data and a lookup table holding the company codes, the respective AR codes and a column telling me wether the company is on the central accounting system or not this column simply holds the information direct or indirect  reflecting the way I gather the datap  pWhenever the company code is linked to direct in the lookup table, my measure should sum up the amounts from the AR table filtered by column company code. When the company code is indirect, the measure should sum up the amounts from the AP table filtered by column AP number.p  pThe idea would be to build a DAX measure that sums up the AR amounts along these linesp  pIf companyin lookup table  direct then use the company code and sum all amounts in table AR when match in column company code of table AR. p  pElse if companylookup table  indirect then use APaccountnumber from lookup table and sum all amounts in table AP when match column AR account no.p  pMaybe the picture below can clarify my idea a bit further.p  pId be very grateful for some ideas how I can build a DAX measure for the above.p  pThanks a lotp  pimg srchttpi.imgur.com6b5YPsR.png altenter image description herep

Negative 40 pIm trying to create a Quadtree structure in python for detecting collisions amongst polygons, and Ive gotten pretty far see end of the post.  However, I realized that this structure only works for empointsem, because Im deciding which leaf to put the object in based off of its center.p  pSo I need to figure out how to modify this quadtree so I can detect collisions of emregionsem like a circle.p  pTheres a few different ways I can think about doing thisp  ul liOnly put objects in the node that they completely fill in  this seems inefficient, because the whole point of Quadtrees is to put objects in the leafs for easy searchretrieval and to reduce the number of objects I retrieve.li liPut the object into every leaf that it overlaps with  this seems like a good solution, but Im not entirely sure how to approach the overlap decision making and Im wondering if this will be inefficient.li li  is there a better solutionli ul  pThe option 2 placing the object in multiple nodes, I feel like itd be best to draw a bounding rectangle around the object, and then use the extents of the object to decide which leaf to put it in  but this would require effectively inserting each object 4 times one for each corner, and that seems like an inefficient way to approach the problem.p  pAny better suggestions        p  precode    class Quadtreeobject          A simple Quadtree implementation.

Negative 40 pI am developing an android calendar app which will enable users to view, create, update and delete their events. To improve user experience and performance i have adopted a Contentprovider centric design pattern which was recommended during Google IO 2010 conference on Android client application. I have successfully implemented the client rest service that create, update and delete events parsed from the content provider to a Restful web service written in PHP but i need some ideas on how to implement the get request in order to prevent data conflict and maintain accurate persistence on the client side. The restful web service returns a JSON payload of all the event based on a users id, so i want to store these record in my contentprovider with not conflict is more like a sync. For instance, if a user reinstalls his app, how do i ensure that the data already stored on the server is persistent which the applications content provider which has a local SQLite database. A more basic explanation is populating the contentprovider with nonduplicate events after the application is reinstalled or an event is added directly to the server. Thanks in advances. p

Negative 40 pI have a server farm setup on IIS7 and 2 rewrite rules to help redirect any nonhttpsssl requests to be https.  Works amazing but for the 3rd rule which says, if you are going to the services area, dont redirect that as our client wishes to allow nonssl posts to their services while they all adjust their apps to be SSL.p  pThe 3rd rule works when enabled and anything not SSL and not a POST service call gets redirected to HTTPS, however if it is a POST service call, I get a 405 HTTP Verb not allowed.  Which is strange since Im allegedly just passing it through to the server farm untouched.  If I disable all the rules and send a nonssl POST service call it works like a charm.p  pSo my questions arep  ol lipAside from a 307 which doesnt work is there anyway to do a redirect and include the POST data with IIS URL rewrite, thereby taking the nonssl posts and simply pointing them to the ssl area Im pretty sure this is impossible, but I always learn something new every day from folks.pli lipIf 1 is not possible through URL rewrite, am I missing a setting or something in my URL rewrite that is somehow changing the POST service call and is giving me the 405 HTTP Verb not allowed.pli ol  pBaffling, but thanks for any insight you may be able to give.p

Negative 40 pI am developing android application which allow users to share localization data between them, and showing it on the map. Ive done it, and its working but I am looking for better performance, or just better pattern for app like this.

For instance, if user is logged he is sending his gps data every 10 sec to server, and gets other users positions. Everything by HTTP POST.p  pFirst thing I want to ask youp  pDoes anyone knows better solution to sync data with server than android service with timed task every 10 sec I have background service that is running all the time and every 10 sec runs AsyncTask which asking server about users localizations.p  pAnd what do you think about connection method with server Maybe it will be better to create connection by socketsp  pThanks in advance for all responses.p
Negative 40 pI have a VB.Net Excel addin that queries a SQL Server database through several userdefined functions. There are also a couple of custom ribbon tabs, one of which presents the user with a form where they can select the appropriate server and database, and test to see that a connection can be made. Once a successful connection test has occurred, the customer would like the addin to somehow indicate that the user is connected. Right now Im playing around with a really small user form that contains no other controls, and has a .Text property of CONNECTED or NOT CONNECTED depending on the state of a connection test. This works, but isnt perfect since the form can be moved, and wont follow Excel if the user chooses to move the application to a second monitor. I was wondering if anyone has worked with something similar before, or has other ideas. p

Negative 40 pIve seen other questions asked on the site inquiring as to whether or not it was acceptable practice to set a Scanner object as public or static to allow it to be used by multiple methods, and the consensus has been that it wasnt the worst thing you could do, but it was probably better to not do it in any large, complex program.p  pMy particular question pertains to a file scanner, which requires the whole throws exception clause that Im not entirely familiar with yet, still a beginner. I cant set it to static outside of the methods because as far as I know, the class itself cant throw exceptions. Is it acceptable to make it public in say, the main method Do I have any better alternativesp  pThe purpose of the program is to parse a complicated text file actually, a .lua file essentially storing a hierarchy of tables, and so Ive broken it up into several methods in my attempt to search for specific data within it and it shouldnt end up being longer than 200300 lines of code with 6 or so methods.p

Negative 40 pI am new programmer developing an iOS game and would like to program an animated line to guide the user to drag an object from point A to point B. So Id like the line to start with length  0 at point A and animate itself to say length  100 pixels to point B.p  pI am using SKShapeNode, and currently to animate it, I am really recreating the line each frame through the update method with a variable that depends on currentTime for the line to be slightly longer and longer length until it reaches the desired length using the following code note that the line is dashed p  pHowever Im running into several performance issues that when I fix, cascade into more. I need to step away from having the objects length a function of the time that has elapsed from voidupdateCFTimeIntervalcurrentTime. Instead I want to have one method that can be called to animate this line  I was reading and feel like this might be achievable through CoreAnimations like CABasicAnimation here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions26815958iosdrawinglinesanimatedIos drawing lines animateda but Im not sure exactly how to accomplish this.

Negative 40 pToday I found performance issue on the project Im working. Im using Laravel framework so most queries are not generated by hand.p  pThe problemp  precodeSELECT count FROM table LEFT JOIN a ON table.aid a.id LEFT JOIN b ON table.bid  b.id LEFT JOIN c ON table.cid  c.id codepre  pwhere codetablecode has about 100k records executes code0,7scode whereas p  precodeSELECT count FROM table codepre  pexecutes code0,01scodep  pSo the performance loss is huge. The question is  is it possible to add anything to the query to make query being executed faster to tell MySQL to ignore LEFT JOINS when there are no WHERE conditions and the second question  why MySQL uses joins at all in this case when all joins are LEFT and there is no where p  pThe problem here is that I add many conditions to the query so sometimes many WHERE are used up to 2030 conditions and for some of conditions joins MUST be used.p  pAt the moment I couldnt check indexes its quite possible they can cause the problem but Im still surprised that MySQL doesnt ignore joins in that case.p  pAs a workaround Ill not use left joins for count in this case when no conditions are used or for about 1015 conditions where no joins are needed but for others I should create codemapcode for joins that are needed.p  pAS Gordon Linoff mentioned in the answer joins wont create any extra rows, if query without joins generate 10 rows, the exact same of rows will be returned if those joins will be used.p

Negative 40 pI have the suspicion that some performance problems in one of our applications is caused by too much eager loading of some associations by hibernate, which might be resolved by switching to lazy loading. Unfortunately it is quite difficult to track how and when the associations are actually used  and much less how often they are used on average. Are there some tools hibernate logging options which help to decide which of the eagerly loaded associations should be better lazily loaded and  or switched to other a hrefhttpdocs.jboss.orghibernateorm4.3manualenUShtmlch20.htmlperformancefetching relnofollowfetching strategiesap  pFor instance I could imagine a tool that says for logs for each hibernate session how many objects of each class were loaded and how much of them have actually been accessed by the application, or even generates some statistics about that. Of course, in the end only a load test can decide what is better, but this might give you some ideas what to try. Or perhaps there are even better tools out there.p

Negative 40 pIm currently learning java and want to create a project, using maven, hibernate and MySQL. I know that in order to use any of the artifacts with maven, I should find it on mvnrepository and add it to pom.xml.

Considerp  precodeAAA  task1 all AAA  echo finalizing task1  echo task1 task2  echo task2 AAA  task2 codepre  pThis would print only codetask1code, but not codetask2code, since at the moment of parsing the codeallcode rule, the variable codeAAAcode held only the codetask1code.p  pIs there any workaround for that Or some way to make the codemakecode expand the variables lazily, like it does inside the commandsp  pP.S. In my case the codeAAAcode variables is setchanged inside included files. Most are included at the top. Few are included at the bottom  and they are affected. I cant simply move all the include files to the top, since that messes up the default rule. And I cant easily add the extra prereqs to the rules, since there are multiple rules which rely on multiple variables would lead to lots of copypaste. The only ideas I have come up with so far were A to extract the final value of the variable and call codemakecode recursively with its full value a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma16427542360695based on the suggestion herea or B move the variabe from prerequisites to the command and loop over it calling codemakecode recursively for every prerequisite. Id love to have a more elegant alternative.p

Then i have created another thread group to simulate 100 users and by using the Beanshell Preprocessor, i have assigned the same cookie value to 100 users as below,p  precodeimport org.apache.jmeter.protocol.http.control.CookieManager import org.apache.jmeter.protocol.http.control.Cookie import org.apache.jmeter.testelement.property.JMeterProperty  CookieManager mngr ctx.getCurrentSampler.getPropertyHTTPSampler.cookiemanager.getObjectValue  int count Integer.parseIntprops.getPropertycookiecount  forint i0 ilt count i     Cookie cookienew Cookie         props.getPropertycookienamei,         props.getPropertycookievaluei,         props.getPropertycookiedomaini,         props.getPropertycookiepathi,         Boolean.parseBooleanprops.getPropertycookiesecurei,0L         mngr.addcookie         log.infon Cookie Detailscookie   JMeterProperty cookiepropctx.getCurrentSampler.getPropertyHTTPSampler.cookiemanager cookieprop.setObjectValuemngr ctx.getCurrentSampler.setPropertycookieprop codepre  pNow i need not to create 100 users eveytime, instead i passed the same cookie value to 100 users and every user will use same cookie value.p  pI need just to confirm whether this is valid performance testing Will the response time be accurate by passing same cookie value for all users p
Negative 40 pI have the situation where I have written an R function, codeComplexResultcode, that computes a computationally expensive result that two other separate functions will later use, codeLaterFuncAcode and codeLaterFuncBcode. p  pI want to store the result of codeComplexResultcode somewhere so that both codeLaterFuncAcode and codeLaterFuncBcode can use it, and it does not need to be recalculated. The result of codeComplexResultcode is a large matrix that only needs to be calculated once, then reused later on. p  pR is my first foray into the world of functional programming, so interested to understand what it considered good practice. My first line of thinking is as followsp  precode run ComplexResult and get the result cmplx.res lt ComplexResultarg1, arg2   store the result in the global environment.   NB this would not be run from a function  assignCachedComplexResult, cmplx.res, envir  .GlobalEnv codepre  pIs this at all the right thing to do The only other approach I can think of is having a large wrapper function, e.g.p  precodeMyWrapperFunction lt functionarg1, arg2      cmplx.res lt ComplexResultarg1, arg2      res.a lt LaterFuncAcmplx.res     res.b lt LaterFuncBcmplx.res       do more stuff here ...  codepre  pThoughts Am I heading at all in the right direction with either of the above Or is an there Option C which is more cunning  p

Negative 40 pIm pretty new to python I mainly write code in Java. I have a python script thats essentially a crawler. It calls phantomjs, which loads up the page, returns its source, and a list of urls that it found in the page.p  pIve been trying to use Python 3s codemultiprocessingcode module to do this, but I cant figure out how to use a shared queue that workers can also add to. I keep getting unpredictable results.p  pMy previous approach used a global list of URLs, out of which I extracted a chunk and sent to workers using codemapasynccode. At the end, I would gather all the returned URLs and append them to the global list. The problem is that each chunk takes as long as the slowest worker. Im trying to modify it so that whenever worker is done, it can pick up the next URL. However, I dont think Im doing it correctly. Heres what I have so farp  precodedef workerurl, urls     printmultiprocessing.currentprocess.name  .  strmultiprocessing.currentprocess.pid   loading   url     returnedurls  phantomjsurl     printmultiprocessing.currentprocess.name  .  strmultiprocessing.currentprocess.pid   returning   strlenreturnedurls   URLs      for returnedurl in returnedurls         urls.putreturnedurl, blockTrue      printThere are   strurls.qsize   URLs in total.n  if name  main         manager  multiprocessing.Manager     urls  manager.Queue     urls.appendltsomeurlgt      pool  Pool     while True         url  urls.getblockTrue         pool.applyasyncworker, url, urls      pool.close     pool.join codepre  pIf there is a better way to do this, please let me know. Im crawling a known site, and the eventual terminating condition is when there are no URLs to process. But right now it looks like I will just keep running for ever. Im not sure if I would use codequeue.emptycode because it does say that its not reliable.p

Negative 40 pI recently suffered through a long ASMXVB6 to WCFVB.Net migration.  The application was originally written in the 90s. It has 42 DLLs and seven different logs.  My goal was to create a uniqueish transaction ID within the running thread by setting the Name to a starting number now.milliseconds and then increment the number each time a new request was handled by the same thread.  So, instead of the logs all using the same thread ID for many requests, an individual request can be traced across many logs using the thread name.p  pMicrosoft decided that they should make Thread.Name a writeonce property.  I could set it to my uniqueish name, but if I tried to change the name like Java by incrementing the value I would get p  blockquote   pInvalidOperationException A set operation was requested, but the Name   property has already been set.p blockquote  pThanks Microsoft.  This would have been so perfect and easy.p  pMy question is strongWhat is the besteasiest method to create a uniqueish ID for logging to multiple files that is as accessible from dozens of DLLsstrong  Im pretty sure this has never been asked before.p

Negative 40 pAccording to the play docs a hrefhttpswww.playframework.comdocumentation2.4.xScalaWebSocketsHandlingdifferenttypesofmessages relnofollowon WebSocketsa, you can use different types for input frames and output frames provided you supply a FrameFormatter for each type.

Negative 40 pThe UI consists of a horizontal paged codeUIPageViewControllercode. Each page has a codeUIViewControllercode inside it that has a zoomable codeUIScrollViewcode. Each scroll view has a codeUICollectionViewcode inside that which scrolls vertically. The zoom works but the paging doesnt.p  pIf I dont disable the scrolling of the codeUICollectionViewcode then the codeUIPageViewControllercode stops paging.p  pI tried chaining the gesture by changing codecontentOffsetcode of the codeUIScrollViewcode inside the codeUIPageViewControllercode and it didnt work as the pages would snap back on the next run loop.p  pI tried requiring gestures to fail in a number of combinations between the codeUICollectionViewcode and the codeUIPageViewControllercodes codeUIScrollViewcode.p  pIm wondering if anyone has some recommendations of how to get paging while keeping vertical scrolling in the codeUICollectionViewcode. My flow layout codescrollDirectioncode is set to vertical only.p  pThis implementation works when instead of the codeUICollectionViewcode being at the top of the view hierarchy I use a codeUIImageViewcode.p  pAny help is greatly appreciated.p

Negative 40 pIm sorting an array of objects. The objects have lots of fields but I only care about one of them.

However, I wonder if this is bad code. Through this codeComparatorcode, two very distinct objects could be considered the same ordering even if they are unequal objects. I decided to use codehashCodecode as a tiebreaker, and it came out something like thisp  precode    Collections.sortdetails, new ComparatorltMyObjgt          Override         public int compareMyObj d1, MyObj d2               if d1.getDate  null ampamp d2.getDate  null                  return d1.hashCode              else if d1.getDate  null                  return 1              else if d2.getDate  null                  return 1                           if d1.getDate.befored2.getDate return 1             else if d1.getDate.afterd2.getDate return 1             else return d1.hashCode  d2.hashCode               codepre  pwhat I return might be backwards, but thats is not important to this questionp  pIs this necessaryp  pstrongEDITstrong To anyone else looking at this question, consider using Googles ordering API.

I would like for the sake of the exercise, to apply auto.arima to values1 and values 2, per factor. My expected output would be emsomethingem that, per factor, takes into account both columns of values, and forecasts both each as its own univariate time series. So if the dataset has 5 factors and 2 columns of values, I would need 10 listsdata.frames.p  pSome options that did not work Splitting the data.frame per factor viap  precodesplitdat, datfactor codepre  pAnd then using coderapplycodep  precoderapplydat,functionx forecas.Arimaauto.arimax,datfactors codepre  pOr codelapplycodep  precodelapplysplitdat,datfactors, functionx forecast.Arimaauto.arimax codepre  pAnd some other combinations, all to no avail.p  pI thought that the easiest solution would involve a function in the apply family, but any solution would be valid.p

Negative 40 pI would like emalmostem every View in my Django project to compute, for instance, codetimeonmarscode. This variable needs to be put into every template context, so every template can draw codetimeonmarscode. Id also like every View to be able to use that variable if it wishes, maybe to compute codeisitnighttimeonmarscode or whatever. Id like to do this using inheritance, or some other mechanism, so when I provision a whole lot more than mars time, I dont repeat myself.p  pIs this an appropriate use of classbased Views I guess Id create a base class view, and in its get and post methods, calculate the current time on mars, then call child class methods doGet or doPost, intercept the result, put the mars time into the result, and continue. Seems tedious.p  pDecorators Is there a way I can put codetimeonmarscode into the closure context for the viewp  pWhats the pythonic djangonic way to do thisp  pEDIT I like the idea of context processors, but Ive changed my mind  instead of emeveryem view, Id like emmostem views to get this.

Context processors dont work, because inside the someview business logic, I want access to w,x,y,z. I dont like doing the mixing strategy for CLA on the TemplateView, because again, it doesnt give me access to w,x,y and z inside someview or whatever the equivalent of someview is, and I want to, well, do a bunch of business logic somewhere, and TemplateView doesnt seem to give me that p

Negative 40 pI am working on a game in Scratch based on Word puzzle. Player is given with set of alphabets on the screen and they have to make a word from it. I need to check first that the entered word is valid, for example player entered wrok but the valid word is Work. p  pAfter the word is valid I want it to show on the Stage. Can anyone guide  p  pI thought of using python script with Scratch, a variable can store the word entered by the player and it can be sent to python script and using python library enchant it can be checked. If the python returns True then it can be shown on the Stage.p  pI am not sure how to proceed or whether this procedure is correct.p  pThank youp
