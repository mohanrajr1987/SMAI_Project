Positive 92809 pThe last couple of days Ive tried to debug a network error from d00m. Im starting to run out of ideasleads and my hope is that other SO users have valuable experience that might be useful. I hope to be able to provide all relevant information, but Im not personally in control of the server environments.p  pThe whole thing started by users noticing a couple of network errors in our app. The error seemed to occur randomly, without any noticeable pattern related to internet connectivity, iOS version or backend updates. The two errors that occurs behind the scenes arep  pcodeError DomainNSURLErrorDomain Code1001 The request timed out.codep  pand more frequentlyp  pcodeError DomainkCFErrorDomainCFNetwork Code1005 The network connection was lost.codep  pAfter debugging it for a couple of days, Ive managed to reproduce these errors occurring at random by firing approx. 10 random GET and POST requests towards our backend with a random sleep timer between each request set at 120 seconds. However, it only occurs in periods. What Ive experienced the last couple of days is that when a period of error starts, I get one of the two errors every once or twice I run the code meaning an error rate of 110 or 120 requests. This error rate continues for a couple of hours and then the error disappears for a couple of hours and then it starts all over.p  pSome quick facts about the setupp  ul liHappens on device and simulatorli liHappens on iOS 8.4 and iOS 7.1  although v. 8.4 is the main one I use for testing.li liWe use codeNSURLSessioncode for our network requests. We also have AFNetworking included updated to latest version, but we only use the Security part for SSL Pinning. Even with SSL pinning totally turned off, the error still occurs.li ul  pSome findings Ive written down during the last couple of daysp  ul liIt seems to only happen on our production environments which has some different configuration as our staging environments. This lead me to think that it might be related to the codekeepalivecode bug as discussed a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions25372318errordomainnsurlerrordomaincode1005thenetworkconnectionwaslost2599697125996971herea and a hrefhttpsgithub.comAFNetworkingAFNetworkingissues2314herea. However, our ops department have set up a new staging environment sending the same codekeepalivecode header as the production environments, but this did not make the error occur on the staging environment.li liOur Android version of the app were unable to reproduce the error using the same setup of requests. Further, weve not received any customer issues on network errors in the Android app.li ul  pMy gut feeling says that its related to the server environment and the HTTP implementation in iOS. Im however unable to track down a convincing pattern that proves anything. Ive made the same setup using a simple Rails script, and when the next error period occur, Ill be ready to try and reproduce it outside of iOS land. Ill update the question when this happens.p  pIm not looking for solutions involving resetting wifi settings, shutting down the simulator or similar as I do not see this as feasible solutions in a production environment. Ive also considered making the retryloopfix as mentioned in the GitHub issue, but I see this as a last resort.p  pPlease let me know if you need any more information.p

Negative 92809 pUsing NetStream to stream content from http, Ive noticed that esp with certain exported h264s, if the player encounters an empty buffer, it will stop and buffer to the requested length as expected.p  pHowever once the buffer is full, the playback doesnt resume, but instead jumps ahead, as such instantly playing the buffered duration in a brief moment, and thusly triggering an empty buffer again.. this will then continue over and over.p  pPresumably when the netstream pauses to buffer, the playhead position continues, and the player is attempting to snap to that position on resume however given it could take 5 seconds to build a 2 second buffer it ends up with a useless buffer again..p  pthis is an assumptionp  pIve attempted to work around this by listening for an empty buffer netstatus event, pausing the stream, and at the same time setting up a loop to check the current buffer length vs the requested buffer length.. and resuming once the buffer length is greater than or equal to the requested buffer.. however this causes problems when there isnt enough of the video remaining.. for example, a 10 second buffer with only 5 seconds remaining, the loop just sits there waiting for a buffer length of 10 seconds when theres only 5 left...p  pYou would think that you could simply check which was smaller, the time left or the requested buffer length.. however the times flash gives are not accurate.. p  pIf you add the net streams current time index, plus the buffered time, the total is not the entire duration of the movie when at the end.. it is close but not the same.p  pThis brings me back to the original problem, and if there is another way to fix this, clearly flash knows when the buffer is ready, so how can i get flash pause when it buffers, and resume once the buffer is ready currently it doesnt.. it pauses and then once the buffer is full it plays the entire buffered content in about .1 of a second.p  pThanks in advance, Stephen.p

Negative 92809 pI have a typical setup. The solution contains a regular .NET class library for business objects, A WCF project, a silverlight project and supporting webapp project, and some silverlight class libraries.

When I add reference of this service in my silverlight class library project, the proxy is generated without any errors, but this proxy does not contain any definition of the service or the service interface itself. It does contain the definition of the complete object model contained inside the business object I am returning from the service, but without the actual reference to the service client I am unable to make a call to the service.

Negative 92809 pIm creating a library of display objects for our application. They render the html of a lot of the common objects users, conversations, messages, etc in various views. By views I mean the object can spit back different zoom levels of itself with different markup.p  pSome display objects contain other display objects to render eg. a user list object renders user objects in a certain view this particular view spits them back in list items so they fit into the listp  pIm trying to move these into the proper way of doing things in ZF, but I cant decide if these should all be view helpers, or if they are all view scriptspartials.p  pJust making them view scripts and rendering them with render seems a little dirty because any information or parameters I want to pass to them has to be assigned to the view object.p  pPartials seem a little more correct, except not sure if its proper to be doing display logic in these if showNotificationStatus is passed as a parameter, render this span. Or if its kosher for partials to render other partials a user list rendering the user object.p  pView helpers seem like possibly the right way to do it, but I dont know if that is overusing view helpers. Each object could be a view helper and accept a objectview parameter so it knew what zoom levelcontainer to render itself in, or each objectview could even be its own helper so theres no big switch statement inside an object. One nice thing about the views is you can pass parameters and it still has access to the view context if you need something from that level.p  pMost of these are going to be accepting models, with a few requiring some extra parameters to know what to do eg. showNotificationStatus from above.

Negative 92809 pI have a Windows Form with a RichTextBox on it. The content of the RichTextBox is written to a database field that ist limited to 64k data.

But with the formatting overhead from the Rtf I can type more text than I should be allowed to.

Negative 92809 pIm currently designing an API where I wish to allow configuration via a variety of methods. One method is via an XML configuration schema and another method is through an API that I wish to play nicely with Spring.p  pMy XML schema parsing code was previously hidden and therefore the only concern was for it to work but now I wish to build a public API and Im quite concerned about bestpractice.p  pIt seems that many favor javabean type PoJos with default zero parameter constructors and then setter injection. The problem I am trying to tackle is that some setter methods implementations are dependent on other setter methods being called before them in sequence.p  pI could write anal setters that will tolerate themselves being called in many orders but that will not solve the problem of a user forgetting to set the appropriate setter and therefore the bean being in an incomplete state.p  pThe only solution I can think of is to forget about the objects being  beans and enforce the required parameters via constructor injection.p  pAn example of this is in the default setting of the id of a component based on the id of the parent components.p  pMy Interfacep  precodepublic interface IMyIdentityInterface      public String getId      A null value should create a unique meaningful default      public void setIdString id     public IMyIdentityInterface getParent     public void setParentIMyIdentityInterface parent  codepre  pBase Implementation of interfacep  precodepublic abstract class MyIdentityBaseClass implements IMyIdentityInterface     private String id    private IMyIdentityInterface parent     public MyIdentityBaseClass       Override    public String getId        return id               If the id is null, then use the id of the parent component      appended with a lowercased simple name of the current impl      class along with a counter suffix to enforce uniqueness         Override    public void setIdString id        if id  null            IMyIdentityInterface parent  getParent           if parent  null                 this may be the top level component or it may be that                the user called setId before setParent..            else                id  Helpers.makeIdFromParentparent,getClass                   else            id  id                Override    public IMyIdentityInterface getParent        return parent         Override    public void setParentIMyIdentityInterface parent        parent  parent       codepre  pEvery component in the framework will have a parent except for the top level component. Using the setter type of injection, then the setters will have different behavior based on the order of the calling of the setters.p  pIn this case, would you agree, that a constructor taking a reference to the parent is better and dropping the parent setter method from the interface entirely Is it considered bad practice if I wish to be able to configure these components using an IoC containerp  pChrisp

Negative 92809 h1In a nutshellh1  pWhenever a postback would occur AJAXed by an UpdatePanel I want to do a callback beforehand and only after the callback has completed either successfully or not should the postback occur. How can I do thisp  h1Elaborate explanationh1  pWe use ASP.NET AJAX UpdatePanel n stuff together with DevExpress controls. Among those controls is the ubiquitous GridView. As is typical with ASP.NET gridviews, you can edit rows onebyone, and to save your changes you have to hit the update button at the end of the row. However if you make some changes to the row, then forget to press the update button, and hit something else in the page say the big red SAVE button that causes a postback and saves the whole form to the DB, your changes will be lost. The row will still be in edit mode, but it will have reset to the data it had initially when you started the edit.p  pOur clients are emnot happyem with this and want the row to be saved automatically if the user forgets to do so himself.p  pLuckily the DevExpress gridview is smart enough to have an Update method which I can call from JavaScript. Unluckily that causes a callback and returns immediately. If I allow the postback to continue as normally, the callback will get aborted. Well, technically its a race condition I guess, but so far it seems that the postback wins. There are events to which I could attach for successfailure of the callback, but I dont know how to resume the postback that started it all.p  pWe could turn off callbacks for all the grids, but that would be a performance disaster.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 92809 pEDITp  pI wonder if anyone has ever given this some thought or have some ideas about it. Like most of you I have multiple programs running at the same time. I have set up alert methods in each such that I get email alerts when a program stops or runs into errors. Now some of these programs use visual studio TaskFactory class to create parallel tasks and I have coded exception handling to handle errors. But I am sure some of you have encountered instances where a program process will halt for some reason and unless you are constantly sitting at your pc and checking some log file, there is no way to know if the program is running at that time or not.  so before many answer with....Task Manager...I wanted some intelligent ideas on ways of having your program notify you when it is stuck in some process or fails with some error an exception handler has not caught...if nobody runs into these types of cases then I guess I will just forget about it. Is there a way to interact with the task manager processes using visual studio, vbCp

Negative 92809 pThis is not so much a technical question as a question of practice browser storage doesnt seem to have the same browser behaviour as cookies.p  pFor examplep  ul liIn Firefox 3.6, sessionStorage is not shared between tabs within the same browser session.li liplocalStorage can never be set to expire, while sessionStorage can never persist.pli lipIf a site uses cookies for the session, they are shared between tabs.pli liIf a cookie is set to expire, then it expires after a certain date.li ul  pIt makes sense that it is not like for like, however this means that we may need to mix and match our variable storage solutions depending on need. Your thoughts and opinions on the benefitspitfalls of either would be appreciated.p  pBackground On the website we are currently developing, we decided to implement progressive enhancement using browser storage sessionStorage and localStorage with a cookie fallback. Our reason for doing this is simply as a learning exercise, but moving forward this should help us on mobile platforms and situations where cookies are not usable we are already storing our assets on a a hrefhttpcode.google.comspeedpagespeeddocsrequest.htmlServeFromCookielessDomain relnofollowcookieless domaina, so this isnt a motivator.p  pTo do this, we have created a class which has set, get, remove and clear methods which store the application variables within a JSON string this allows us to group values in a hierarchy. For browsers which dont have a JSON parser we use a hrefhttpwww.json.orgjs.html relnofollowCrockfords JSON plugina.p  pAt run time the storage class works out if the users browser supports browser storage, otherwise sets the functions to write to cookies instead. Due to the inconsistencies already highlighted plus others I am unaware of, this like for like progressive enhancement is actually false.p  pEdit Another browser vaguary if IE 8 is running in IE 7 standards mode it supports localStorage and sessionStorage, where standalone IE 7 does not.p

Negative 92809 pMy question is simple, how do I display a custom error page for HTTP status 405 method not allowed in Django when using the coderequirePOSTcode decorator p  pIm using the codedjango.views.decorators.http.requirePOSTcode decorator, and when the page is visited by GET request, the console shows a 405 error, but the page is just blank not even a Django error page.

Negative 92809 pXML has a lot of benefits. Its both machine and human readable, it has a standardized format and it is remarkably versatile.p  pIt also has some disadvantages. Its verbose and not a very efficient means of transferring large amounts of data.p  pOne of the most useful aspects of XML is the schema language. Using a schema you can generate source code in any modern programming language to read an xml format without the tedious process of hand coding that usually accompanies most other file formats.p  pThis got me thinking about whether a schema language for arbitrary binary file formats exists and if not, would it be a worth while endeavorp  pJust in case Ive been unclear. Im asking about a language whose purpose is to define byte offsets, field and record lengths, delimiters, etc. that could be parsed to generate code that would read a file format that conformed to that specification. p  pI doubt Im the first to suggest such an idea so if you know of any projects or working groups that have or are currently pursuing this area Id be grateful.p

Negative 92809 pas the title suggests... I need to use floating points as array indexes, but the GCC compiler spits out an error complaining.p  pBasically I have a mathematical function say Fx,t where the function has variables x and t.

So naturally I would have two for loopsp  precodefor x  xmin x lt xmax x  dx      for t  tmin t lt tmin t  dt          f[x][t]  10x  10t  Over simplified.. but you get the idea         And then perform some fourier transform fftf[x][t], 256, 1 codepre  pSo yea, that is why I was wondering if it is possible to get floating points as the array index.p

There are codena.code methods that interpolate from nearest neighbors, but in this case they do not recognize that the missing value is at the time that is the lowest value of the day.

Negative 92809 pSorry to bother anyone with what may be a silly questionp  pI have a lot of code that uses C style variable arguments. The code passes in a variable called strongendstrong at the very end of our variable length function calls. And.... the code also have an enumerator called strongendstrong. So far they havent clashed compiler error says it has an ambiguous definition It wont tell me where the mysterious second end is defined until I changed to the vc 10.0 compiler VS 2010. p  pSo is strongendstrong some sort of reserved keyword used especially in variable args  I know very little about them. But Ive looked at tons of documentation on variable arguments, as well as searching here, and found nothing which could be a good thing. So I would guess the answer is that strongendstrong is not a special word used with varargs. Can I get someone to confirm thisp  pThanksp

Negative 92809 pHey. Im trying to read strings into an array from a file that contains a list of words. This is so that I can check to see if strings are a real word by seing is they exist inside my array. I have everything working except the compare.

Negative 92809 pThis question can be rephrased asp  pHow can I include a single change in the trunk of a specific file into an existing TAG.p  pA simple question, but one I was not able to resolve to satisfaction myself.p  pThe concept comes from other SCM tools, where you just move a tag over the different revisions and stick it to the exact revision you need. Those other tools have the native understanding of what a Tag is, where SVN generalized everything as a copybranch.p  pBelow answers I have seen on other bulletin boards and posts on this same, and as such were already considered and rejectedp  ol liThis is not the proper use of SVN ul liActually, SVN was designed to be generic, and accomplish many use patternsli liThis is a mission to find an answer. I understand the challenges, and the possibility of never finding an answer. Maybe I will switch to a different tool.li ulli liWhy are you using SVN such our so, it is better to do this and that. ul liThere are many use patterns or SCM models that can be adopted. In my case specifically ul liThe Trunk represents ongoing development, and small patches are applied to it.li liProduction is a single TAGli lithe turnaround from development is very short and aggressive, and as such we cannot work with several complete production releases. That means I can not everytime create a new tag for every little subchange deployed in production.li liSo in short Complete Packaged Production releases do not exist in my scenario.li ulli liThis is my Use case scenario I need.li ulli ol  pWell, I wont be presumptuous, and I will read every single solution provided and reconsider as needed.p

Negative 92809 pIm currently maintaining a web application usingp  ul liJavali liJSPServlets ie. no frameworksli liWebSphereli liDB2li ul  pIts basically a CRUD application that lets users view data and manipulate them. Its almost as if its a replica of the DBMS, only on the web. The code is full of SQL statements everywhere  in almost each of the servlets in the application.p  pCurrently, my manager is asking me to implement some sort of filters for the data. p  pLets say we have a table codeSomeTablecodep  precodeCol1     Col2     Col3     Col4     Col5                      data2    data3    data4    data5    data6   codepre  pIn the application, if you go to the codeSomeTablecode page, you get to see the exact same data from the codeSomeTablecode table, with the one exception that theyre displayed in an HTML table. Now, what my manager wants is for the user of the application to be able to filter the data from a different page lets call this filter page and then after applying the filters, go back to codeSomeTablecode page and display the filtered data.p  pIn the filter page, theyll be able to choose something likep  precodeCol1          data2 Col3   LIKE    some Col4    IN     1,2,3 codepre  pThese options are all from select boxes. We currently have a functionality like that in one of the pages but its ugly. SQL statements being passed around session attributes and concatenated with each other on the end. Plus, I cant really reuse them without copying all the code. p  pSomeone probably invented something to deal with this and Im wondering if anyone can give me a advice on how to approach this problem. Is there a framework that I can use or would it be easier to do it just by hand since the application is not really that big.p

Negative 92809 pLets say I have 2 pages in a sharepoint site. Lets call them page A and B. We are using windows based authentication mechanism. Lets say I have 2 already authenticated users X amp Y. The page A should be visible to users who have certain attribute set to 1 in active directory. Page B should only be visible to those users that does not have this attribute set to 1. Lets call this attribute SpecialUser. If SpecialUser is 1 for a given user, user should be able to see page A only and not be page B. If SpecialUser has any other value, user should be able to see page B only and not be page A.p  pIn this case, user X has the attribute SpecialUser set to 1 and user Y does not. So user X should only see page A while user Y should only see page B.p  pThere is no group in active directory that includes only users that have SpecialUser attribute value set to 1.

Negative 92809 pSorry for the newbie question, but I cant seem to figure this out.  I have been basically following this example from Microsoft on how to create a web site with loginsp  pa hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary879kf95c.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary879kf95c.aspxap  pI did deviate from the example some in that I went ahead and created roles Admin, user. I created a folder called Admin and inside there is a web page. I configured the Security wizard to Deny access to that page for Anonymous, User, and All Users. When I run the page in Visual Studio it will not let me see the page unless I log in, but once I log in I can see the page. When I publish the web site and try it from another computer or even the local one for that matter it will let me see the page without logging in.p  pI am certain I have no idea how to correctly publish the database. When I first published the page the login that I created in the security wizard was not valid, so I copied the aspnetdb into the AppConfig folder in my application directory and it would now let me log in, but it does not seem to be holding the access rules that I have set. Im pretty certain that I am not publishing correctly but Ive been unable to figure out what the correct way to move the settings over is when publishing.p

Negative 92809 pIm using Symfony 1.4 to allow users to import various types of CSV files, and Ive decided to consolidate validation and sanitizing of the actual contents of uploaded files into a custom validator  The custom validator would extend sfValidatorFile.p  pAlso, when a file contains errors, Id like to throw global errors on forms, rather than displaying them as fieldlocal errors  and  have the ability to show many validation errors at the same time for a given import file.p  pIm pretty sure I can make this work by using a Post Validator, but this doesnt seem like a great fit for a Post Validator since I really only need knowledge of one form field in order to perform my custom validation, but more importantly, Id like something a bit more elegant that packages all of the extra validation work into a single custom file validator. p  pFor example, instead ofp  precodethisgtvalidatorSchema[file]  new sfValidatorFile   thisgtvalidatorSchemagtsetPostValidatornew myFancyValidator   codepre  pId just like to do something likep  precodethisgtvalidatorSchema[file]  new myFancyValidator   codepre  p...and have validation errors encountered inside myFancyValidator added to the forms collection of global errors.p  pIve tried a few different approaches to push errors onto the forms globalErrors from within my custom validator, but Im missing something regarding how the various pieces of the validation puzzle fitscope together.

Row 1 has chr10 and row 2 has chr10, if they are the same, then continue to the next step, else move onp  pStep 3 Now compare exon start  a number looks like 101542463 in row 1 and the number in row 2 looks like 101544365, now they are not the same, save the file and move on. Imagine if the numbers are the same, then continue to compare exon end which is step 4.p  pStep 4 Assume, the exon start from two different rows are the same, then compare exon end. The number from row 1 looks like 101542634 and the number of exon end from row 2 looks like 101544538. Same condition as above, if they are different, leave the file alone and continue comparing the next GENE.  Here is the part that requires attention, if they are the same, that means, GENE are the same, chr are the same, exon start and exon end are the same. In the end, everything is the same, that means there is a duplicated row. Now, the duplicated rows will be deleted. But whats the condition of deleting the row. This will link us back to the challenge that we solved from requirement 1. Remember that the number of occurrence has been counted for all refGENE Recall 29 times for NM000927, 32 times for Nm00078. The rows of GENE should be removed should are the ones contain NM000927. But, please keep a record for all the deleted data, and all the remaining data, preferably with a table.p

Negative 92809 pIm facing a requirement to create a static method on my base class,  but dont like that I have to declare type arguments, so Im wondering if Im going about this the right way.p  pBasically, Im assigning delegates that Ill associate with properties on the class.  I could easily put the method on the inherited classes, like sop  precodepublic class Foo      public string Property1  get set    public class InheritsFoo  Foo       public void AssignDelltTValgt         ExpressionltFuncltInheritsFoo, TValgtgt expr,          ActionltInheritsFoo, TValgt action             codepre  pOr, in an extension class, I could do thisp  precodepublic static void AssignDelltT, TValgt     this T source,      ExpressionltT, TValgtgt expression,      ActionltT, TValgt action      where T  Foo    codepre  pBoth of these would enable me to use codeAssignDelcode in an instantiated classp  precodevar foo  new InheritsFoo foo.AssignDelx gt x.Property1, handler codepre  pBut I have a requirement to make codeAssignDelcode static. This makes the extension way of doing it useless. It still works in codeInheritsFoocode, but I really want to move this to the base class. If I try, the generics argument cant be inferred, and I have to change the usage of the methodp  precodeInheritsFoo.AssignDelltInheritsFoo, stringgtx gt x.Property1, handler codepre  pIs there a way out here, another way of doing this I havent thought ofp  pEDIT to address the issue in the comments about whether or not the extension method wouldshould work... I went to the url referenced by Mark M.  Turns out that if I write it as such...p  precodeInheritsFoo foo  null foo.AssignDelx gt x.Property1, handler codepre  pThat compiles dont know if it will run, though.  Still, dont think that qualifies as using a static method, since foo is still considered an instance  A null instance, but an instance nonetheless.p

Negative 92809 pHas anyone successfully tried minifying AND concatenating all the jqGrid locale files so that they could be loaded in one HTTP request and cached in the browser  p  pIt is a simple task to minify each file separately, but the current jqGrid i18n model requires dynamically loading the correct script file e.g. code..i18ngrid.localeXX.min.jscode based on the users locale.  This is because the resource files simply extend the .jgrid object without even knowing what their own locale is.  Including more than one in a download would simply apply the last one to be loaded and executed.p  pI would prefer to have all those static locale objects available to the clientbrowser at once, and then programmatically apply one via the grid options or perhaps via a jqGrid method.  This seems to be a more common pattern for client side localization, e.g. the jQuery UI Datepicker, Globalize fka jqueryglobal, Moment.js and others.p  pSo has anyone successfully done this, or should this be a feature requestcontribution to the jqGrid projectp

Negative 92809 pThis is a general noob question about software design, so I apologise if it seems vague, but I would really appreciate the advice. Note the system described below is purely an example, not a specific product I have in mind.p  pI often have a need to combine the functionality of several libraries or utilities, written in different languages. For example, if I want to code a highperformance audio processing application for the desktop, I will write it in C  C. Then, I want to add a nice GUI. But I dont want to learn Qt. I like the look and feel of Adobe Air, and would like to use that. Later, I have a need to access a USB device. But the USB library I have only has an API in Java. How can I combine all these elements together, to take advantage of their relative strengthsp  pClearly, I cannot compile these various elements into one single executable. So I need to create and run them seperately, and give them a means to communicate. The most common way to do this seems to be using IPC Inter Process Communication, eg shared memory or sockets. I prefer the idea of sockets, as the programs could potentially run on seperate machines on a network.p  pSo I decide to create a local client  server system, with a custom API, to allow these elements to communicate. For example, the Air application will receive a message from the C application, telling it to update its UI. The USB application running in Java will use the sockets to stream audio from the USB hardware, into the C application.p  pMy question  is using local sockets in this way a typical way to design such a system Will the performance be much worse than a truly native application e.g. everything in Java or C, in a single executable  It also seems likely that such an approach would be prone to bugs, and difficult to maintainp  pI frequently find myself coming up against the limits of existing software libraries e.g. a graphics library with a pretty, flexible UI but no way to access lowlevel hardware, or a media library that can mix many audio streams, but has no support for video playback, and find it very frustrating. If anyone could advise the best way to combine arbitrary software libraries like this, I would really appreciate it.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 92809 pCurrently my application uses the FlickRaw gem to pull data from Flickr. I want to refactor and tidy up parts of it more and remove the FlickRaw dependancy.p  pSo, What I am using now is HttParty and calling the Flickr API methods directly.p  pI have made a Flickr class and in there I have methods such as self.collection, self.photoset and so on to pull the appropriate stuff.p  pMy concern is that from the locations in my app where I actually need to integrate with Flickr using those methods, I have to call Flickr.collectionid. If Flickr suddenly seized to exist, I would have to go and find all those references to Flickr and alter them. I would prefer to rename my Flickr class to something like PhotoHost and have methods in there which DO call Flickr but as the Flickr specific part is all together, it should be easier to alter in the future if required. Does this sound a sensible way to deal with this How would you go about itp  pAlso, would the methods in that class map directly 11 with the real API methods or would you sort of make you own methods and build an array of data that you actually want before using it elsewhere in the app or would you just send the flickr response to those other areas and deal with it there  Actually, after typing that it seems the best way to go would be to write a method called for example self.photosforalbumalbumid and then call the appropriate flickr api methods to build up an array of photos and then have the method return that. I guess that would allow me to write the other code around the app to interact with the photos and if I ever change the photo host from Flickr then as long as the new methods return an array in the same format all should be good.p  pSorry, This question has been a bit of a braindump, but I would be very interested in hearing how others would go about thisp

Negative 92809 pI was hoping to utilize MonoDroid from Xamarin and build a very simple 2D platformer that could run on both Android and the PC.p  pComing from PC, I know that certain libraries are better than others when it comes to rendering and certain patterns are important to follow.  For example, we can have libSDL make hardwareaccelerated graphics by passing in a simple flag and building resources as such.  In OpenGL, youre basically always hardware accelerated for the most part.p  pIn Android, it looks like we have a basic 2D rendering that is done in software prior to v. 4.0ICS and 3D that is done in hardware.  Does anyone have any experience or bottlenecksbenchmarks for performance  Im shooting to deploy to the Ouya or other Android computers eventually which should be on v.4.0 and be pretty strong  Im just curious what the best way to go about building a game for Android is.p  pIm thinking lots of screen refreshing and all that  basically something that would be similar to what weve come to expect with PC gaming.  I figure if I go the OpenGL  ES route, that lets me port my systems a LOT easier between the two, just building an Ortho viewport  but what kind of performance can one expect to get in streaming data to the GPU  I realize this is highly dependent on device as it is with graphics cards, but if anyone has access to some benchmarks that give me a trend of general idea i.e. G1   polygons Galaxy S1   polygons S2   polygons etc.p

Negative 92809 pI have a table that uses a surrogate primary key. The natural key of the entity table is namespace  name. The web application accessing the table will offer the user a web form that allows the user to update any property of the entity. I am using Hibernate for ORM. When issuing a session.updateentity, the entity would need to have its ID surrogate key populated to allow Hibernate to identify the record in the database. I can think of 2 ways of doing this  brbr1 pass the ID hidden to the frontend and then back to the business layer upon update on the form  brbr2 pass only the natural keys and do a lookup using natural keys in the DAO layer to get the ID.  brbrNote that the natural keys cannot be updated using the form. There is a separate form for altering the identity namespace  name of the object and concurrency isnt an issue i.e. no one would be able to alter the identity while someone else holds a lock for update so looking up using the natural key would still yield the same record that was used while requesting the update. brbrbQuestionsb br1Are there any approaches besides the ones I have mentioned br2How is this typically accomplished in web applications  brbrI tried searching but couldnt find much information on this probably not searching with the correct choice of words.p

Negative 92809 pI am trying to debug a Windows Azure Cloud project locally with Visual Studio 2012 running the Windows Azure SDK 1.7 on a Windows 8 PC with IIS 8 Express. The cloud project includes a Web Role running an ASP.NET MVC 3.0 web project that includes WCF RIA Services that in turn links to a Silverlight project hosted on that web site. When I run the web site directly and do not try to debug the Azure cloud project I am able to access the web site and the Silverlight application and the RIA Services are accessible with absolutely no issues. If however I debug the Azure Cloud project the emulators start up and the web site comes up. I am able to then access the Silverlight application but when it tries to make a request back to the WCF RIA Services Domain Service I receive an error from the IIS Server stating that the domain service is not available. I then try to go directly against the WCF RIA Service endpoint to see if it will come up outside the Silverlight application and again I receive a 404 Not Found response when going to the .svc endpoint.p  pI have gone through various searches to try and resolve the issue and I have used Fiddler to ensure the network requests are not having any issues. I have not been able to identify any problems. I also tried turning on WCF tracing to see if any errors comes up, but the trace files are not even updated when I debug through the Azure Cloud project.p  pAfter repeatedly getting this behavior I have attempted a complete reinstall of Visual Studio 2012 and the Azure 1.7 SDK, but I still get the same behavior. Does anyone have a suggestion of what the issue may be or how I might try and track down the issue, since the WCF tracing is not offering me any additional informationp

My approach would be to use a nested for loop, to go through each element and an if statement. E.g.p  precodefor i  0 i lt 20 i      for j  0 j lt 40 j      Not sure what goes here I want a function that identifies the element in the array     if some variable  88     printfThe treasure is at d, d, i, j codepre  pThanks for your help p  pisland[20][40] works fine. I just want to know how to search through it for a specific character.p
Negative 92809 pIm attempting to publish a ClickOnce Office Extension project VS2010. By default the output folder of ClickOnce has a child folder with each version of the binary files named Application Files. I need to change this to something without a space in the name, for example AppFiles.p  pI havent found any place in the docs where this is explained and the few answers I have found have said to use Mage to manually modify .VSTO file next to the bootstrap setup.exe. Id like to avoid that if at all possible.p  pWhat is the best way to go about changing thisp  hr  pI have tried a few different things. Instead of using the built in Microsoft.Common.props, In a copy of   Microsoft.Common.targets Ive modified the DeploymentApplicationFolderName property inside the CopyFilesToPublishFolder target to ApplicationFiles. Also in a copy of Microsoft.VisualStudio.Tools.Office.targets, Ive modified the Value of the ApplicationFilesFolderName property set inside InitializePublishProperties to ApplicationFiles.p  pEven after doing that, when I publish I get the following errorp  precodeError 121   Publish failed with the following error Could not find a part of the path ltpath to output directorygtapp.publishApplication FilesProjectStats10015. codepre  pIm guessing the problem is this is happening when the copy from the output dir to the publish dir happens but I dont know. Either way, the output directory hierarchy seems fine and the VSTO refers to the proper path in the hierarchy for the relevant dlls. Its just the publish process fails.p

Negative 92809 pIm trying to build and install my own gcc 4.7.2 in usrlocal to use in place of the gcc 4.4.6 in usr. This is on CentOS 6.3.p  pgcc makes executables and dynamic libraries that dynamically link to its own dynamic libraries, e.g. libstdc.so. How do I build and install gcc so that the generated binaries automatically get a linker rpath option rpath usrlocallib64 that causes dynamic libraries in usrlocallib64 to be linked instead of those in usrlib64 or lib64p  pIf it works properly, after I build an executable with the gcc without specifying Wl,rpathusrlocallib64, when I ldd the executable, it should show usrlocallib64libstdc.so.6 instead of usrlib64libstdc.so.6. Similarly for the libgccs.so.1.p  pI have tried different approaches, including specifying LDFLAGSFORTARGETWl,rpathusrlocallib64,rpathusrlocallib on the configure commandline, but nothing worked.p

Negative 92809 pIve written some VBA code which takes a single cell and identifies all its dependents in the workbook via a NavigateArrow analysis and adds their range location to an array. From here I want to be able to update each dependent and change the reference to the original single cell to another single specified cell.p  pThe particular difficulty Im having here is that although I know where each dependent is, the reference to the original cell may be at the start, middle or end of a formula, and may be unanchored, rowcolumnboth anchored, may be on a different worksheet and hence have a worksheet reference preceding it, etc, etc. Therefore I cant make an easy find and replace in each dependent cell, because of these potential differences, plus I want to maintain the original anchoring held in each cell reference.p  pIs there an elegant  or even inelegant  VBA solution to this problemp

Negative 92809 pI am trying to find a way to display a tableview and a detail view inside of a single view controller, and have the detail view update its contents based on which tableview cell is selected. p  pThis is exactly what a UISplitViewController does however, I am looking for a completely custom interface that I cannot accomplish with the cookie cutter SVC. p  pBasically I have a single view that has a small tableview on the left it doesnt fill the entire height of the screen, so its a custom size and then a detail view on the right.p  pI have tried a couple way of doing this, such as programmatically creating the table, using view controller containers, etc. p  pI only want to change the text and images that show up in the detail view when a new cell is tapped, not push a new detail view. p  pAny idea on how to accomplish this  p  pThanks in advance p

Negative 92809 pI am looking to see if its possible to make AJAX calls to a given website using a different authenticationsecuritysession context than the page making the AJAX call, but ideally usingaccessing the same web application on the server and authentication schemep  pe.g. The browser requests and receives a hrefhttpsweb.server.comadminpage.html relnofollowhttpsweb.server.comadminpage.htmla which requires AUTHENTICATION and processes the pages JavaScript, which specifies an Ajax call to something like a hrefhttpsweb.server.comserverinfo.html relnofollowhttpsweb.server.comserverinfo.htmla which does not emrequireem credentialsauthentication every 30 seconds.p  pThe pages JavaScript also automatically logs out the user after a certain time based on the server session length. Since every call to the server that does not specifically kill the serverside session such as the final automatic logoff call essentially restarts the users session timer, Id like to be able to keep making an UNAUTHENTICATED serverinfo.html call every 30 seconds without affecting the users AUTHENTICATED serverside session.p  pI would imagine I could do this with multiple applications on the server, which happen to access the same database and other resources, but I would greatly prefer a way to keep it all within the same application.p  pI guess the question is In order to accomplish this, do I have to use separate server applications, or rather can I use the same application, and if it is possible, does it depend upon the server or application technology in usep

Negative 92809 pI discovered that some old branch integrations in Perforce recreated some files that were previously deleted. Because this was not caught in time, later integrations also modified the branched file.p  pFor examplep  precode        MAIN         BRANCH cl 1 X rev1    X rev1 cl 2              X removed in branch cl 3 X rev2 cl 4              main gt branch integration, X2 reappears cl 5 X rev3 cl 6              main gt branch integration, X rev3 codepre  pWhat is the Perforce way to back out these changes. Clearly, I could go in and delete file codeXcode in BRANCH and submit that. However, if it were 100s of files, this would be quite a task.p  pThe more correct path, would seem to be to back out the integration of the file. However, I attempted this, and Perforce does not actually mark the file to be deleted. p  pIts not clear if you should backout change list 6, or change list 4p  pIs this a perforce or user bug Maybe there is some flag to force perforce to remove files during a back out operation.p

Negative 92809 pI have a recurring issue where my git repo I think will decide it needs to garbage collect. This process takes well over a half hour, and will then trigger on every pullpush operation. p  pRunning Git GC manually takes a half hour, but doesnt seem to fix the issue. The only solution I have found is to delete my repo and clone fresh, which is suboptimal for any number of reasons. p  pMy git GC operations may be slow because I have set git some memory limits to stop it from crashing out on git GC operations, as it used to do when it hit the 4gb windows memory limit and then crapped out.p  pAny help would be appreciated. It is a large repo, the repo does contain a significant amount of binary data, as well as a large number of very sizeable 500k text files.p  pSo, 1. How do I limit the amount Git decides to garbage collect. 2. How do I speed up the GC operation 3. What can I do to solve or minimize the greater issues involved aka, why it has to garbage collect in the first placep

Negative 92809 pAfter reviewing the a hrefhttpsoftware.intel.comenusarticlesinteldigitalrandomnumbergeneratordrngsoftwareimplementationguideIntel Digital Random Number Generator DRNG Software Implementation Guidea, I have a few questions about what happens to the internal state of the generator when codeRDRANDcode is invoked. Unfortunately the answers dont seem to be in the guide.p  ol lipAccording to the guide, inside the DRNG there are four 128bit buffers that serve random bits for codeRDRANDcode to drain. codeRDRANDcode itself will provide either 16, 32, or 64 bits of random data depending on the width of the destination registerp  precoderdrand ax    put 16 random bits in ax rdrand eax   put 32 random bits in eax rdrand rax   put 64 random bits in rax codepre  pWill the use of larger destination registers empty those 128bit buffers more quickly For example, if I need only 2 bits of randomness, should I go through the trouble of using a 16 bit register over a 64 bit register Will that make any difference on the throughput of the DRNG Id like to avoid consuming more randomness than is necessary.pli lipThe guide says the carry flag will be set after codeRDRANDcode executesp  precodeCF  1   Destination register valid. Nonzero random value          available at time of execution. Result placed in register. CF  0   Destination register all zeros. Random value not available          at time of execution. May be retried. codepre  pWhat does not available mean Can random data be unavailable because codeRDRANDcode invocations exhausted those 128bit buffers too quickly Or does unavailable mean the DRNG is failing its health checks and cannot generate any new data Basically, Im trying to understand if CF0 can occur just because the buffers happen to be transiently empty when codeRDRANDcode is invoked.pli ol  pNote I have reviewed the a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma110427781899721answersa to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10484164whatisthelatencyandthroughputoftherdrandinstructiononivybridgethis question on throughput and latency of RDRANDa, but Im seeking different information.p  pThanksp

Negative 92809 pAs a follow up to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11127089circularreferencesbetweentwoclassesan older question of minea, I wish to implement a clientserver mockup simulation, where the client initiates a sequence of actions that involve calling methods on the server, which, in turn, can call methods on the client lets ignore the issue that the stack may blow up.p  pMore specifically, since I want to split the implementation from the definition, I will have server.h and server.cpp for the Server class and client.h and client.cpp for the Client class. Since Server holds a reference to Client and calls methods from it, it needs to codeinclude client.hcode. Also, Client holds a reference to Server and calls methods from it, it needs to codeinclude server.hcode. At this point, even if I use header guards in both server.h and client.h, it still messes up yeah, its expected so I decided to forwarddeclare the Server class in client.h and the Client class in server.h. Unfortunately, this is not enough to solve the issue, because Im also calling methods from the two classes, so I managed to make it compile amp run properly, as far as I can tell, by including server.h in client.cpp and client.h in server.cpp.p  pDoes the above hack sound reasonable Should I expect some unforeseen consequences Is there any smarter way to do this without having to implement a proxy classp  pHeres a rudimentary sample of how the implementation will look likep  pfile client.hp  precodeifndef CLIENTH define CLIENTH  include ltiostreamgt include ltmemorygt  class Server  class Client  private     stdsharedptrltconst Servergt server  public     Client        void setServer const stdsharedptrltconst Servergt ampserver      void doStuff  const      void doOtherStuff  const   endif codepre  pfile client.cppp  precodeinclude client.h include server.h  void ClientsetServer const stdsharedptrltconst Servergt ampserver      thisgtserver  server   void ClientdoStuff  const      thisgtservergtdoStuff   void ClientdoOtherStuff  const      stdcout ltlt All done ltlt stdendl  codepre  pfile server.hp  precodeifndef SERVERH define SERVERH  include ltiostreamgt include ltmemorygt  class Client  class Server  private     stdweakptrltconst Clientgt client  public     Server        void setClient const stdweakptrltconst Clientgt ampclient      void doStuff  const   endif codepre  pfile sever.cppp  precodeinclude server.h include client.h  void ServersetClient const stdweakptrltconst Clientgt ampclient      thisgtclient  client   void ServerdoStuff  const      thisgtclient.lockgtdoOtherStuff  codepre  pfile main.cppp  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltmemorygt  include client.h include server.h  int main       stdsharedptrltClientgt clientnew Client     stdsharedptrltServergt servernew Server      clientgtsetServerserver     servergtsetClientclient      clientgtdoStuff      return 0  codepre

Negative 92809 pI have created a Setup Project in VS2010 for my VC project and I have it generating a setup file and it includes Primary Output, Content Files, Documentation files and Resource Sattelite DLLs from my VC project.

My issue is that the Setup Project does not include these language DLLs nor their directories into which they must be placed.p  pI would have thought that these DLLs were included in the Project Output but they are not. p  pI know I could add them manually by referencing the files directly, but that means including a absolute reference which I would rather not do.

Negative 92809 pI have an assignment that requires me to take a single scanf and perform some math operations to several integers.

Negative 92809 pI am using visual studio 2010,C and trying to execute unitintegration tests. I got integrationtest project which references several other projects. When I want to execute my test, it builds again amp again, before executing the test. This is the same case when i execute the tests with both Resharper amp MSTest. I am sure it has to do with Visual Studio, attaching debugger to the context. As a final attempt, I removed all project references from integration project and when i start execute the tests, i saw the same behaviour. It means, the compilation is not specific to the project and the whole solution is being built.  I already spent my whole day trying to fix this up.

Negative 92809 pI need to send and receive objects that contain a few small fields, plus one large Xml string, via WCF, like sop  precode[DataContract] public class ServiceResponse      [DataMember]     public int Id  get set      [DataMember]     public string Xml get set  codepre  pI must use an Http based binding, but the service is internal, so contract dlls will be shared. The Xml string could reach a few MB. The service allows transfer of data between servers via the client machine, so the first client call retrieves a large lump of Xml, saves it to local disk, then a second call transfers the data from disk to another service instance on some other box somewhere else. So the client literally saves the data and forwards it, no logic or processing at all.p  pI need the most efficient mechanism  meaning small payload, and fast  for sending these objects.  p  pSome questionsp  ul liWhat is the most efficient way of sending a large chunk of Xml in a payloadli liIs there any advantage in serializing the object to a codeMemoryStreamcode before sending across the wire using a codeBinaryFormattercode and then using a codeStreamcode type as the parameter in the service operationli liFor messages of a few MB, does using a codeStreamedcode transfer mode make any differenceli ul  pI cant use third party libraries like Protobufnet sadly.p  pAppreciate any advice... p

Negative 92809 pI feel like such a noob for asking this question, but its been bugging me for a while now.p  pWhen designing the BLL of a tiered application, would you put all your entity classes in one namespace For example If you have a database with Customers and their Vehicles and these Vehicles get Serviced on lets say a Monthly basis. I would think one would keep the Customers and their Vehicles in a separate module from the services module so that if you ever need to update the way services are done or where the data is stored, you do not need to touch the CustomerVehicle module.p  pAm I correct in thinking this way or should I change my design ideasp  pThis has presented me with a problem with using LINQ to SQL. If half of the tables entity classes is contained in module A and the other in module B then somewhere you are going to have module A reference module B and vice versa to accommodate the associations between 2 tables that border with the modules.p  pOR just thought about this now would you have 1 tables entity class overlap in the modules having the same class in both modulesp  pAny advice would be appreciated.p

Negative 92809 pI would like a really simple way to add a UIAlertView once the user has completed a consumable IAP.

I have included my completeTransaction method below and the provideContent method I am using in case thats where the code should go.

Negative 92809 pSummary of this post I have an set of ordered items whose order may change over time. I need to be able to iterate through this set from multiple threads, each of which may also want to update the order of the items.p  pFor example, multiple threads need to access codeStringcode keys in some arbitrary sorted order. They strings are not sorted according to their natural ordering, but by some values that may change hence, a custom codeComparatorcode. My original implementation was to use a codeTreeSetcode and synchronize on it. If any of the keys needed to be reordered, a thread would remove the key from the map, update the comparison value, and reinsert the key. To implement this, the keys are native codeStringcodes, but the comparator has access to the values. This is a weird arrangement where the order of keys may change over time, but since a changed key is always removed and reinserted when it changes, it seems to work. I suppose it could also work if the codeStringcodes were wrapped inside another object.p  pI recently became aware of the codeConcurrentSkipListSetcodecodeConcurrentSkipListMapcode implementations which are basically threadsafe sorted sets resp. maps. It seems like I can now iterate through the keys without having to lock the entire data structure. However, is there a way I can use them to atomically remove a key and replace it with another, like the operation I was doing above, so that other iterating threads dont miss the item, and without having to use codesynchronizecode blocksp  pIf anyone can suggest a better data structure for this type of operation, Im all ears, toop

Negative 92809 pI am in the process of upgrading an old winforms program to WPF that utilizes Caliburn Micro for MVVM and Ninject for DI.p  pI have updated my solution to a WPF solution which runs a nongeneric implementation of the Caliburn Micro bootstrapper.  I do this because I do not currently have a base ShellViewModel to run from.p  pIm using a Ninject flavor of bootstrapper instead of the standard Caliburn Micro bootstrapper, since Im fairly familiar with Ninject.p  pThe bootstrapper looks like thisp  precodepublic class NinjectBootstrapper  Bootstrapper      private const string EXTENSIONPATH  Plugins     public static IKernel Kernel      protected override void Configure              Kernel  new StandardKernel          Kernel.BindltIEventAggregatorgt               .ToltEventAggregatorgt               .InSingletonScope          Kernel.BindltViewModels.IAnalysisOutputTableViewModelgt               .ToltViewModels.AnalysisOutputTableViewModelgt               .InSingletonScope          Kernel.BindltIWindowManagergt             .ToltWindowManagergt             .InSingletonScope           Kernel.BindltFormMaingt               .ToSelf           protected override object GetInstanceType serviceType, string key              if serviceType  null                      return Kernel.GetserviceType                   throw new ArgumentNullExceptionserviceType           protected override IEnumerableltobjectgt GetAllInstancesType service              return Kernel.GetAllservice           protected override void BuildUpobject instance              Kernel.Injectinstance       codepre  pTo get my main form to startup I was forced to override OnStartup in my App.xaml.cs as suchp  precodepublic partial class App  Application      protected override void OnStartupStartupEventArgs e              base.OnStartupe         NinjectBootstrapper.Kernel.GetltFormMaingt.Show       codepre  pAs may be apparent above, I exposed my main Ninject kernel as a public static to get access to it, though I realize this is probably an antipattern, and once I have finished converting the program I will resolve this.p  pI have implemented a new child window of my main form using proper MVVM.  I need to open the window from a button as suchp  precodeprivate void dataViewerButtonClickobject sender, EventArgs e      windowManager.ShowWindowanalysisOutputTableViewModel  codepre  pSo far so good.p  pThe problem is when I try to close this child window.  Instead of just closing the window, it shuts down my entire program.p  pI imagine this is because, since this child window is the only windowor view Caliburn is handling, once it is deactivated Caliburn decides for me that I want to close the program.p  pIs there any way to stop this automatic close behavior  Perhaps a different way I should be initializing my main formp  hr  h3Updateh3  pUsing Marwijns answer below, I was able to get my application closing properly.p  pIn the end I used codeApplication.Exitcode in my main forms Closing event p  precodeprivate void FormMainFormClosingobject sender, FormClosingEventArgs e      Application.Exit  codepre  pin conjunction with the following modification to my App.xaml.csp  precodepublic partial class App  Application      protected override void OnStartupStartupEventArgs e              base.OnStartupe          var mainForm  NinjectBootstrapper.Kernel.GetltFormMaingt         mainForm.Show          mainForm.FormClosed  mainFormFormClosed           void mainFormFormClosedobject sender, System.Windows.Forms.FormClosedEventArgs e              this.Shutdown0       codepre  pI can now load WPF windows from my main form using Caliburn Micro and Ninject, and everything shuts down properly and doesnt leave any processes running.  This solution appears like it will work well until I am able to update the main form to WPF.p

Negative 92809 pIve built several Android apps using pre3.0 PhoneGap, all requiring the use of Eclipse to compile. In Eclipse I can export a signed application package complete with passwords and keystore file. But in PG 3.0 with CLI, the apk file is built with cordova build android and the resulting apk file in platformsandroidbin ends with debug.apk. Judging by the filename and the fact that I cant find a keystore file anywhere, appears to be employing a debug certificate. p  pIs PG 3.0 supposed to create a signed application package, or am I supposed to open up Eclipse after all and create the signed version from there for the apk I wonder if Im supposed to add more lines to config.xml to make a signed app, but after searching and reading havent been able to see any details on using the xml file for this purpose. p  pDoes PG 3.0 stop with creating only a debug apk, and we then go to Eclipse to create the final apk p

Negative 92809 pWhat I want to be able to do is that, run a vmware machine on workstation, windows xp or 7 for instance. But all the changes I make while I am running the machine e.g. create a file, install something etc, I dont want them to be written to the systemimage. Instead it should act like even the image itself is sandboxed, and when I shut down the machine, the image stays the same.p  pNow, I know about the snapshots functionality, but I basically want to save the time that is expended while reverting an image, on every power down session. Instead it should be such that the changes arent written to the imagesystem in the first place and instead are done in something like memory or a temporary location etc, and thus there is no need to revert when the system is powered off.p  pNow, is this possible to achieve with just vmware workstation itself if not than is it possible with some third party tool or something of the sort if yes then specifically which tool or if this is possible utilizing any other concepts, say ramdisks etc or anything at all reallyp  pAny help at all is really appreciatedp

This concept works fine.p  pNow where is the problem you my ask  My problem is EVERY time I click on another tab amp then return to same tab, I get that specifc tab ViewModel constructor called again, where as I would expect the ViewModel object would remain.p  pThis is problem, because it cause me to lose any modification made on that page, when I toggle between tabs. and since the ctor is called everytime, over amp over, I cant even use the VIewModel to store this information.p  pMy questions are 1 Is there any way I can prevent the TabControl to dispose ViewModel objects when tab is inactive  Meaning to precreate all ViewModels object amp not dispose them when hidden  2 What workarounds using this concept exist, that allow me to store visual tree of the given tab, so if i navigate away from it amp then reopen it, it will store all information on it such as selected check boxes, written text, etc.p  pWould appreciate any help on matter.p  pregards, Idanp
Negative 92809 pIm new in c language and I am trying to understand the pointers concept.p  pI have a basic question regarding the char pointer,p  pWhat I know is that the pointer is a variable that stores an address value, so when I write sth like thisp  precodechar  ptr  hello codepre  pFrom my basic knowledge, I think that after codecode there should be an address to be assigned to the pointer, but here we assign hello which is set of chars.

Negative 92809 pI am trying to figure out the computational complexity of equals in both HashMap and TreeMap in Java. Now, you might say it should be same in both cases as both HashMap and TreeMap inherit the same implementation from AbstractMap. However, I am in need of some explanation before I can fully accept that. p  pHere is what confuses me. Part of the explanation in overridden equals in AbstractMap documentation is p  blockquote   pMore formally, two maps m1 and m2 represent the same mappings if   m1.entrySet.equalsm2.entrySet.p blockquote  pThe documentation is not clear on whether the sets returned by the entrySet are HashSet or SortedSet or something else. In my view this is important to know as it would impact the overall analysis.p  pIf sets returned by entrySet are of type HashSet then two sets can compared in On [cost of equals in case of two hash sets]. However, if they are of type SortedSet then they can be compared in Onlogn [cost of equals in case of two sorted sets]. Consequently, complexity of equals in case of HashMap would be different then in case of SortedMap, or at least it should be based on my reasoning.p  pI strongly suspect I am wrong somewhere in my reasoning, so feel free to tell me where I am wrong. What is the correct reasoning. And, finally I am interested in the complexity of equals in case of HashMap and SortedMap. Thanks.p

Negative 92809 pIm trying to implement a PPTP android client in java for a customer. The authentication is to be done via MSCHAPv2 Security not a concern at this level.

Negative 92809 pOur team has been having quite a lot of trouble with Visual Studios publish feature.  We use TFS and are all running VS 2012 ultimate.  It works fine when only one person is involved in a project, but when we get many people inside one project, the publish profiles get off and Visual Studio reports a successful publish even when all files havent been copied up.

If we create a new publish profile and republish, everything works.  But this is not sustainable.

Negative 92809 pI am building an Android app that that involves taking pictures and adding text to it. In other apps I have built I have been storing the data locally as JSON data. I read that you should always save locallyJSON at every step because you can never be sure when an activity will be stop.p  pIn the app I am currently building I want to upload the data to a SQL database. For example want to take a picture, save it locally and edit itwhile saving at every edit, and then upload it to server. Then I would want to display a list that accesses the database to display finished photos. p  pCan I continue to save things with JSON and then only upload certain things to the database or should I skip JSON and just go directly to databasep  pIs there any built in methods for sending JSON data to a SQL database Just trying to figure out the best way to go about this. Any advice would be appreciated. p

Alle DOM elements that are not on the viewport have not been loaded after a page has been loaded on page load blue boxes in the image. p  pIf the user drag and move the viewport, all dom elements become visible which come onto the viewport. If they are on the viewport they will be loaded via ajax.p  pThe user can zoom in and out the viewport to make it bigger and smaller. Also, if elements that are invisible to the user and thus not loaded yet become visible, than they have to be loaded via ajax and displayed on the viewport.p  pHow do I have to implement this with GWTp  pIf the user loads the page it looks like the following image p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comBXf2t.jpg altenter image description herep  pThe user can drag and move the viewport to 8 directions.

Everything is 100 but now I need to use either session data or cookies to let the user anonymous and authenticated to choose from a pop up with portal one and portal two this is already created as well and change the urls on the main menu accordingly.p  pCurrently the site is set up to have testsite.comportal1products as the url for portal 1 products and test site.comportal2products as the url for portal 2.  The urls are set up exactly the same as this for all of the other content and views.  p  pI also realize that this will get somewhat complex when dealing with users entering the site to internal links.  A logic diagram has already been laid out, but that is a point of concern as well.p

Negative 92809 pIve been trying to move away from using the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.diagnostics.performancecounter.aspxPerformanceCountera class for monitoring a processs CPU usage since it seems it requires a decent amount of CPU when the process count gets decently high when monitoring a lot of processes.p  pMy first approach was to take the WMI route using a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryaa39427128vvs.8529.aspxWin32PerfFormattedDataPerfOSProcessora class and the PercentProcessorTime property, but there seems to be an issue when trying to calculate the CPU usage over multiple cores the max value its returning is 100 making it impossible to divide it based on the CPU core count, resulting in inaccurate results.p  pSo finally I decided to use the Processs class a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.diagnostics.process.totalprocessortime.aspxTotalProcessorTimea property. Sadly I am unsure how to calculate the percentage of the total CPU usage used by the Process based the value. I know that I should subtract the current PercentProcessorTime value from a previous PercentProcessorTime value to get how much time the processor spent on the process within a certain time limit but I am unsure how to continue from there.p  pThanks in advance.p

Why is thisp  pNarrowed down some more. Why does node.left  node.left.left make changes to my tree and node  node.left do nothing.p  pI fixed it by recursively reassigning nodes of the parent as opposed to recursively reassigning the nodes in the child.

Negative 92809 pIm would like to compare the performance of two heuristics for a game AI that I am working on. One processes elements in FIFO order the other in LIFO order.p  pAs it stands, the code uses a codeQueuecode to process element in FIFO order. In OOP I would have a codeBagcode interface implemented by both codeStackcode and codeQueuecode, and I would use codeBag.pushcode and codeBag.takecode to interact with the structure. Then I would assign the result of either codeStack.create code or codeQueue.create code to a variable of type codeBagcode, based on the value of a command line flag, for example.p  pI know how to replicate similar behavior in OCaml using abstract classes and constraining types with codegtcode.

The two EF models I want to push into a single ViewModel arep  precodepublic class Section      [DatabaseGeneratedDatabaseGeneratedOption.Identity, HiddenInput]     public Int16 ID  get set       [HiddenInput]     public Int64 LogoFileID  get set       [Required, MaxLength250, ColumnTypeName  varchar, DisplayNameRoute Name]     public string RouteName  get set       [Required, MaxLength15, ColumnTypeName  varchar]     public string Type  get set       [Required]     public string Title  get set       [HiddenInput]     public string Synopsis  get set       [ForeignKeyLogoFileID]     public virtual File Logo  get set    public class File      [DatabaseGeneratedDatabaseGeneratedOption.Identity]     public Int64 ID  get set       [Required, MaxLength60, ColumnTypeName  varchar]     public string FileName  get set       [Required, MaxLength50, ColumnTypeName  varchar]     public string ContentType  get set   codepre  pAnd I would like to build a ViewModel that looks likep  precodepublic class SectionViewMode      public Int16 SectionID  get set       public bool HasLogo  get set  Set to True if there is a FileID found for the section     public string Type  get set      public string Title  get set      public string Synopsis  get set   codepre  pI would assume it would be best to create a constructor method in the ViewModel so when codeNEWcode is called on it the data is filled but what I can not seem to find or figure out is how I go about filling that data.p

So this is like, we render a template, then change its url using codepushStatecode, not update template based on url changes. Is this true or notp  pEditp  pSo maybe Im not clear enough. Lets say I have something like thisp  pre classlangdart prettyprintoverridecodevoid main    InputElement input  querySelector.input   ButtonElement changeUrl  querySelector.changeurl    changeUrl.onClick.listenevent      window.history.pushStatenull, test tile, input.value       Map urls         showRoot,     userid  showUserProfile       window.onPopState.listen      var location  window.location.pathname      urls[location]     codepre  pI can get codeinputcodes value by clicking on codechangeUrlcode, and then by adding a listener to codechangeUrlcode, I can use codepushStatecode to update url on browser. What Im expecting is, when I do codepushStatecode, the codewindow.onPopStatecode will triggered and invoke the callback when in reality it doesnt. p  ptldr, what Im trying to achieve isp  plisten on url changes  get current url  use current url to invoke a handler stored in a map. Using codeonHashChangecode also doesnt work when updating url using codepushStatecode prefixed by codecode.p

Thus, there are multiple SIS Terms for each LMS Term.p  pEach Fact record is at the granularity of a Student within a Class, and associates to 1 LMS Term.p  pIt seems I could make 2 dimension tables DimSisTerm and DimLmsTerm.p  pOr, I could make 1 conformed dimension table DimTermp  pIn the case of a single conformed dimension, there would be 1 record for each SIS Term, however the LMS Term key and its attributes would repeat for all related SIS Term records.p  pCan someone who has experienced this before provide their guidance as to what the tradeoffs are between the 2 scenariosp

[Note The size of a codechar16tcode string literal is   the number of code units, not the number of characters. end note ]p blockquote  pThis seems to mean that it is implicitly assumed that codechar16tcode string literals are UTF16 encoded because surrogate pair is a UTF16 concept.p  pLet me know if theres anything vague in the question.p

Negative 92809 pIm just blundering into AJAX, and I swear Ill actually learn my way around it real soon now, but all I need at the moment is to get the inner browser height, so I can ask the Google Maps Engine for a map of the appropriate height.

Negative 92809 pBasically, I just want to know how can this be achieved.p  pFor example, suppose that I have to exe files, app1.exe and app2.exe. Now, app2.exe does a specific job basing on some settings defined on its variables. I want to know how can I code the app1.exe to generate app2.exe files while defining different settings variables for it, without using any config file, registry or similar.p  pI dont have a specific project with this problem, but I was just wondering how this can be done.p  pemInspired by the famous Trojan Horse stronga hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiProRat relnofollowProRatastrong. It does the same thing, it generates server.exe file with predefined settings from its server creator another exe file. Furthermore it can bound with other files such as images, audio, video etc.emp

One is called hornetqjms.jar and the other is hornetqjmsclient.jar. My assumption is that on one machine, I am using the class from one jar and on the other, i am using the other jar. I have been told that which jar it goes to depends on the order in my classpath. If this is the case, my questions is how do i change the classpath of the war file If not my questions are 1. How do i find out which one i am using 2. how do i change which one i usep  pThanks in advancep

Negative 92809 pHow do I achieve a UITableViewCell with a textField in it Ive been through a few similar questions on StackOverflow, but I find most of them deal with cases where the tableViews display is always constant and the know exactly what values go where. For my implementation the number of section and number of rows per section are determined by the user and could be anything. I have been able to get a textField in the cell but I find any text entered is lost when I scroll the table and the cell disappears from view.

Negative 92809 pI use a SPI port to shift out some configuration data stored in a struct to some ASICs. I have one active struct which contains the next config to be shifted, but the actual config can be any of a dozen different configs that are stored in an array of structs. Currently, Im using memcpy to actually copy the config struct from the array to the active SPI buffer location. Problem is, its pretty slow, and as I do this over and over again the delay starts to add up. I have to do three copies each time for reasons related to daisychaining of my ASICs. p  pSeems like there should be an easy way to do this faster by setting the active struct to point to the correct stored struct, but Im struggling to find it.

Negative 92809 pIve encountered really odd behaviour when using [NSMethodSignature getArgumentTypeAtIndex] function. It returns me  character for BOOL type which in wrong according to objectivec a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibrarymacdocumentationcocoaconceptualObjCRuntimeGuideArticlesocrtTypeEncodings.html relnofollowtype encodingsa. If I use objcruntime.h library method methodgetTypeEncoding BOOL type is correctly represented as a B, however I dont understand why its not working with higher level layer NSMethodSignature.

My only clue is that BOOL is primitive and like this it cannot be used directly when calling objectivec methods. However when I try to check it [object isKingOfClass[NSNumber class]] returns NO.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pOk Ive update XCode to the latest version6.1 6A1052d and situation greatly improves. However my problem now is to distinguish unsigned char encoding from real bool encoding.

So my question now is how to properly workaround older devices, how to distinguish char of BOOL for them Or should I just assume that if encoding is c and argument is equal to 1 we have YES, and for 0 we have NOp

Negative 92809 pIm putting together a new stack of unit tests to be run together as a CI job. Im using vstest.console.exe instead of mstest.exe mainly for its ability to run tests from several frameworks, but right now the focus is a few xUnit dlls. The jobs are run as part of a Jenkins pipeline.p  pI have tested everything successfully on a couple of dev boxes, but annoyingly test discovery is not working on any of the CI build boxes so far. This is after the addition of the 0.99.8 xUnit test adapter vsix also tested with 0.99.7. The xUnit dlls are being built against 4.5 with the 2.0.0.2378 beta nuget version of xUnit.p  pI have reproduced the symptoms with the simplest possible dll, with a single public test method, working fine on my own box, not working on any build boxes. The deployment enviroment is pretty straight forward, with a VS2012 install and the xUnit test adapter, on Windows 2012.p  pI have enabled the TpTrace logging via the vstest exe config files and everything looks fine. I guess Im looking for a way to troubleshoot the issue further maybe tracing for the xUnit discovery process or a workaround the problem. Id prefer to retain the use of vstest console for the simplicity of running several frameworks.p  pI have written up this issue via the a hrefhttpsxunit.codeplex.comworkitem9936 relnofollowxUnit codeplexa site as well.p  pIve checked out this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma210332042658793SO posta but none of the suggested solutions make sense here.p
Negative 92809 pI am new to Xcode but have been developing for a 15 years. I am trying to understand how event declaration works in Xcode.

Negative 92809 pMy iPhone app has background push enabled.  When the push notification is received, codeapplicationdidReceiveRemoteNotificationcode is immediately called in the AppDelegate.  The push notification is interactive, so it has the Options button.  When the Options button is tapped, it shows the View button, 2 actions, and the Close button.  When either of the 2 action buttons are tapped, codeapplicationhandleActionWithIdentifiercode is called in the App Delegate, which is what I want.  However, when the View button is tapped the app opens, but codeapplicationhandleActionWithIdentifiercode is not called.  Is there any method called specifically when the app is opened via the View Buttonp

Negative 92809 pAccording to Wikipedia in article about initrd strongemMany Linux distributions ship a single, generic kernel image  one that the distributions developers intend will boot on as wide a variety of hardware as possible. The device drivers for this generic kernel image are included as loadable modules because statically compiling many drivers into one kernel causes the kernel image to be much larger, perhaps too large to boot on computers with limited memory. This then raises the problem of detecting and loading the modules necessary to mount the root file system at boot time, or for that matter, deducing where or what the root file system is. To avoid having to hardcode handling for so many special cases into the kernel, an initial boot stage with a temporary root filesystem  now dubbed early user space  is used. This root filesystem can contain userspace helpers which do the hardware detection, module loading and device discovery necessary to get the real root filesystem mounted.emstrong p  pMy question is if we add modules etc needed to load actual filesystem in initrd not in actual kernel image to save save then what we will achieve in case of Bootpimage where both kernel and initrd are combined to form a single bootpimage. This size of kernel would increase even by using initrd. p  pCan someone clarify p

Negative 92809 pIve got a weird problem with Xcode 6 6.1.1. I have a test target in which most of the testclasses are disabled aka. greyed out in the test navigator. Still, when I try to run the remaining tests or even when I specifically select a test from the test navigator to run sometimes, Xcode also runs the disabled tests. This doesnt always happen but when it does, the only solution to prevent Xcode from running the disabled tests is to remove them from the target. The issue looks very similar to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions27807859xcoderunallthetestseventhedisabledonesthis questiona. Since I am not doing UI tests I opened a new one.p  pHas anybody else witnessed this behaviour Might it be a bug in Xcode 6 or could I somehow have messed up my project. I would like to provide you with some settings or code but I have no clue what is relevant in the fist place.p  pPS As an interesting and maybe unrelated side note When I try to run any test through the small play indicator left of the source code, Xcode tells me that it cant build the project but doesnt display any errors. When I run the same test through the test navigator, it works like a charm...p

Negative 92809 pI have a row of buttons and i am setting their selectors for background and text programatically. The reason i want to do this programmatically is because, I have a set of themes the user can choose from and depending upon the theme selected, i want to change the selector for the button.p  pFor example, if the user selects a blue theme, when loaded, the background of the button is blue and text colour is white. When he presses the button, the background changes to white and the text colour changes to blue. When user removes the finger from button, the changes revert back to default blue for background and white for text colour. You can see the respective selectors for blue below.p  pThis is similar to all other themes. I have separate XMLs for all the themes. The selector for text colour change works fine.

So the URL for retrieving a photo from S3 could look like thisp  precodehttpjohnsmith.s3.amazonaws.comphotospuppy.jpg codepre  pIs there any way or necessity to cache the images on EC2 The pros and cons I can think of is 1 Reduced S3 usage and cost with improved image fetching performance. However on the other hand EC2 cost can rise plus EC2 may not have the capability to handle the image cache due to bandwidth restrictions. 2 Increased development complexity cuz you need to check the cache first and ask S3 to transfer the image to EC2 and then transfer to the client.p  pIm using the EC2 micro instance and feel it might be better not to do the image cache on EC2. But the scale might grow fast and eventually will need a image cache.Am I right If cache is needed, is it better to do it on EC2, or on S3 Is there a way for caching for S3p  pBy the way, when the client uploads an image, should it be uploaded to EC2 or S3 directly p

Negative 92809 pWe have Java Spring web application providing Restful webservices JSON. All requests are proxied thru Datapower for Basic Authentication. These services are being invoked from native iOS Apps and everything works fine. p  pWe are now building a Hybrid App that consume the same services. I am  getting a CORS error when trying to invoke the same services using Angular http.post. I was able to overcome this by adding a CORS Filter on the Java Web Application on my local development machine and it seems to work.p  pI was wondering if that is the way to go or if there is anything that we can do on the Datapower appliance to accomplish the same that would eliminate the need to update the Java Web App. p

Negative 92809 pSo I wrote a simple C Console Application in Visual Studios 2013, it was a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors for my friends to demonstrate C to them. Each of my friends downloaded the game over Skype, and tried to open the application. However, it didnt work, they are running Windows 88.1 and they got an error, Windows Smartscreen prevented a unrecognized app from starting. For the publisher it says Unknown Publisher. It was a simple error to remove just click more info and run anyway. This problem is however very annoying and if so I would like it to stop when my applications run on others computers. Could it just be the way I transferred the file to them I have look everywhere on the internet but the closest thing I could find was how this happens to Windows Application in VS, how you need a Digital Certificate for Windows to trust you as a Publisher.

Negative 92809 pOK, Ive looked hard and have tried a myriad of variations to get this to work.  I need some help from the perl experts.p  pFirst of all, I know, I know, dont use dynamic variable names  Well, I think I need to do so in this case.  Im fixing an eminheritedem script.  It has a set of variables that are formed with codeprefixcode  codecode  codesuffixcode.  This started small, but prefix is now a list of about 20 and suffix of about 50  a thousand different variables.p  pThe script in some cases loops over these variables, using codeevalcode to retrieve an individual value, etc..  This all works.  The problem is, all uses of the different variables throughout the script, whether inside a loop on the prefix andor suffix or just a hardcoded use, assume that these variables are emglobalizedem by using codeuse var qwvarnamecode.  The number of codeuse varscode hardcoded statements has grown out of control.  Moreover, there are thousands of past input profile files that initialize these variables using global syntax, all of which need to continue to work.p  pI was hoping I could improve maintainability by doing the emglobalizationem step in a loop, dynamically creating the variable names one at a time, then globalizing them with codeuse varscode or codeourcode.  Here is some code to show what Im after.  Ive shown several options here, but each is actually a separate trial.  I have tried other variations and cannot keep them straight anymore.p  precodemy prefixes    one, two, ..., twenty my suffixes    1, 2, ..., 50 my globalvars   for my suffix suffixes      for my prefix prefixes           option 1  remainder of 1 outside of loop          NOTE 1.a no comma 1.b include comma between vars         globalvars . prefixsuffix,            option 2         eval use vars qwprefixsuffix           option 3         my g  prefixsuffix         eval use vars qwg           option 4         eval our g         option 1.a use vars qwglobalvars  or option 1.b my eval globalvars     now use them as global variables if one1 eq ...      if one10  codepre  pIt seems that the problem with use vars besides the fact that it is discouraged is that the string inside qw has to be the actual variable name, not a dynamic variable name.  The eval options dont work, I think, because the scope only exists within the eval itself.p  pIs there a way to do this in perlp

Negative 92809 pIt seems there are some issues when you are using the Godaddy G2 root CA cert with certain SSL libraries. For example, when we use our HTTPS flash client, which leverages Hurlant for SSL validation, we fail if the server has the Godaddy G2 root installed. This one to be specificp  pGo Daddy Root Certificate Authority  G2 SHA1 47beabc922eae80e78783462a79f45c254fde68bp  pOur other fat clients which leverage other SSL libraries do not seem to have a problem when this cert is used as the root CA cert. We can workaround this problem if we rechain a server to use the g2g1 cross cert. When we run into this problem while using this suspect root CA cert from Godaddy and run the output through our flash debugger this is what we getp  p32.Error X509 Unable to verify last certificate in the chain Subject principal is incorrectp  pSo we suspect there is a nullinvalid value somewhere in the cert that our particular client is less tolerant of. However all of my checks with certutil come back clean. I am wondering if anyone else has come across similar oddities using this particular root CA cert or if anyone knows what the actual problem is. p

Negative 92809 pI am doing a project to make a board game using JAVA. Now I want when a player wins, the score will be shown in a Jtextfield.So to do this at first I used a method to get the JTextfield from the Player1Graphics Class in the Declarewin method that is in the GamePlan class.But this showed me a NullPointerException.p  pSo I thought another way.As I cant make object of the GameGui Class to any other class because it will create infinite loop. So I have used another class named Player class and created a variable SName which will take the value from the score variable that is in the decarewin method.Then I used an updatetextfied method in Player1Graphics class that is an inner Class of GameGui Class and set the SName variable on it.Now in runtime all the variable is working well they are passing the value as expected and the JTextfield text value is also updating but visual of JTextfield is not updating.Its not changing from 0 to 1 or 1 to 2.p  pI am givin the code below.............p  pThis are the codes from GameGui Class........p

Negative 92809 pI have recently start working on a Spring MVC project where for the frontend I purchased an AngularJs amp Bootstrap template. Integration and configuration went fine but now that I managed to bring some data on the frontend and Ive noticed some page loading visual issues which happens only when I try to click the menu buttons and therefore navigate from one view to another. Below I have attached 2 screenshots which are showing the left menu with the 2 buttons Contacts and Manage Groups. p  pAssuming that I am on the Contacts page and I click on the Manage Groups button or the other way around when page is loading the grid with the groups or contacts data, for a fraction of a second I can see some of the validation msg and Angularjs expressions, after that the page loads as normal with no errors or such. p  pIve also tested on other browsers, like Firefox and Explorer but the page is loading as normal. It seems that this problem it only happens when I use chrome. any idea how I can fix this p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comRcLlz.jpg relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comRcLlz.jpg altPage1ap  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comUsVFT.jpg relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comUsVFT.jpg altenter image description hereap  pstrongSample Codestrongp  precodeltdiv classpanelheadinggt     ltdiv classrowgt     ltdiv classcolmd6gt         ltdiv ngclasstextleft displayCreateContactButton  true, none displayCreateContactButton  falsegt                 lta nghrefaddContactsModal                rolebutton                ngclickresetContact                titleltspringmessage codecreategtampnbspltspringmessage codecontactgt                classbtn btnprimary                datatogglemodalgt                 lti classiconplusgtltigt                 ampnbspampnbspltspringmessage codecreategtampnbspltspringmessage codecontactgt             ltagt         ltdivgt ltdivgt     ltdiv classcolmd6gt         ltp classtextright stylefontsize1.6em marginbottom0gt Search ltspringmessage codecontacts.headergt              lta nghrefsearchContactsModal                idcontactsHeaderButton                rolebutton                ngclass displaySearchButton  true, none displaySearchButton  false                titleltspringmessage codesearchgtampnbspltspringmessage codecontactgt                classbtn btnsm btnprimary datatogglemodalgt                 ltem classiconmagnifiergtltemgt             ltagtltpgt     ltdivgt     ltdivgt ltdivgt  ltdiv classpanelbodygt     ltdiv ngclassalert alertsuccess alertdismissible fade in displaySearchMessage  true, none displaySearchMessage  falsegt         ltbutton typebutton classclose datadismissalert arialabelClosegtltspan ariahiddentruegtltspangtltbuttongt         ltstronggtlti classfa fainfocirclegtltigtampnbsppage.searchMessageltstronggtampnbsp          lta rolebutton            ngclickresetSearch            ngclass displaySearchMessage  true, none displaySearchMessage  false            titleltspringmessage codesearch.resetgt            classbtn btndefault datatogglemodalgt             lti classiconremovegtltigt ltspringmessage codesearch.resetgt         ltagt     ltdivgt      ltdiv rolealert ngclassalert alertsuccess alertdismissible fade in displayMessageToUser  true, none displayMessageToUser  falsegt             ltbutton typebutton classclose datadismissalert arialabelClosegtltspan ariahiddentruegtltspangtltbuttongt             ltstronggtlti classfa fainfocirclegtltigtampnbsppage.actionMessageltstronggt.     ltdivgt      ltdiv ngclassalert alertblock alerterror state  error, none state  errorgt         lth4gtlti classfa fainfocirclegtltigt ltspringmessage codeerror.generic.headergtlth4gtltbrgt          ltpgtltspringmessage codeerror.generic.textgtltpgt     ltdivgt      ltdiv ngclassalert alertinfo state  noresult, none state  noresultgt         lth4gtlti classfa fainfocirclegtltigt ltspringmessage codecontacts.emptyDatagtlth4gtltbrgt          ltpgtltspringmessage codecontacts.emptyData.textgtltpgt     ltdivgt      ltdiv idgridContainer ngclass state  list, none state  listgt         lttable classtable tablebordered tablestripedgt             lttheadgt             lttrgt                 ltth scopecolgtltspringmessage codecontacts.namegtltthgt                 ltth scopecolgtltspringmessage codecontacts.emailgtltthgt                 ltth scopecolgtltspringmessage codecontacts.phonegtltthgt                 ltth styletextaligncenter scopecolgtActionltthgt             lttrgt             lttheadgt             lttbodygt             lttr ngrepeatcontact in page.sourcegt                 lttd classtdContactsCenteredgtcontact.namelttdgt                 lttd classtdContactsCenteredgtcontact.emaillttdgt                 lttd classtdContactsCenteredgtcontact.phoneNumberlttdgt                 lttd classwidth15gt                     ltdiv classtextcentergt                         ltinput typehidden valuecontact.idgt                         lta nghrefupdateContactsModal                            ngclickselectedContactcontact                            rolebutton                            titleltspringmessage codeupdategtampnbspltspringmessage codecontactgt                            classbtn btnsm btnwarning datatogglemodalgt                             lti classiconpencilgtltigt                         ltagt                         lta nghrefdeleteContactsModal                            ngclickselectedContactcontact                            rolebutton                            titleltspringmessage codedeletegtampnbspltspringmessage codecontactgt                            classbtn btnsm btndanger datatogglemodalgt                             ltem classfa fatrashgtltemgt                         ltagt                     ltdivgt                 lttdgt             lttrgt             lttbodygt         lttablegt codepre

Data is continuously written into Cassandra. After rebuilding nodes in the new data center, all nodes in the new data center receive data. As described in the link above, I start to migrate Cassandra from initial token to virtual nodes. But in between I found data data which was added after rebuild that is unavailable in the new data center. Data in the new data center is missing since the rebuild. After decommissioning nodes in the old data center, everything comes normal.p

Negative 92809 pI have a general question regarding the architecture and flow for a login in a mobile app with azure.p  pSo far i created a custom login with an account table id, username....  But i also want to allow the user to login with his facebook account. Azur already provides a login over facebook but how can i combine the facebook login with the account tablep  pAnother thing that i am thinking about is It is a cordova app and there is already a facebook plugin for cordova. Should i forget about it because of the azure mobile service. After the user logged in over facebook i also want to use the facebook api, i guess for that i need the cordova plugin. So maybe it is a good idea to use the cordova plugin login and send the login info to my azur custom login service to store the info to the account table Any other suggestions p  pMaybe somene can help me or knows another resource where this problem has already been discussed so far i didnt find anythingp

Negative 92809 pstrongemcodeX32codeemstrong is an ABI for codeamd64codecodex8664code CPUs using 32bit pointers. The idea is to combine the larger register set of x8664 with the smaller memory and cache footprint resulting from 32bit pointers. It provides up to about a 40 speedup. See a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq7635013Difference between x86, x32, and x64 architecturesa on Stack Overflow, and the Debian a hrefhttpwiki.debian.orgX32Port relnofollowX32 Portsa wiki page for details and setting it up as a chroot environment.p  pWe have a bug report from a Debian maintainer under the environment. The report is codeadcqcode is an illegal instruction. The inline assembly is activated based on preprocessor macros, so we are not detecting X32 properly or more correctly, not at all until now.p  pThe most obvious choice to me for a preprocessor macro is something like codeX32code, but thats not offered. Based on a hrefhttplists.llvm.orgpipermailcfecommitsWeekofMon20140714109910.html relnofollowClangs patcha and a hrefhttpwiki.debian.orgX32Port relnofollowDebians suggestiona, it looks like codeILP32code can be used. But Id like a more canonical answer since codeILP32code and codecodemodelsmallcode look interesting, too. And Im aware of issues with SSE2, where the compiler supported it but the OS did not.p  pWhat are the preprocessor macros that can be used to reliably detect an X32 ABI and environment when using Clang and GCCp  pTo be clear, Im not trying to fix the code at this point. I just want to know the macros that can be used in a complete remediation.p  hr  precode cpp dM lt devnull  sort define amd64 1 define amd64 1 define ATOMICACQREL 4 define ATOMICACQUIRE 2 define

Negative 92809 pI want to convert a NSAttributedString to HTML string. Ive been searching how to solve it, but I have no results yet.p  pAny idea how can I do itp
Negative 92809 pSo I have a database of mechanical components. I have a search form in the database that allows the user to apply filters to a query through the use of 5 textcombo boxes and an apply filters button. This query will contain the components that made it past the filter, and some details about those components.  Also on the search form, I have a subreport that is bound to the query.p  pMy plan is to have the user filter though the data using the controls on the form. As the user filters out components, the report should update to display what components pass the new query. They would then select the component they are interested in by clicking on a record in the report, and that component ID would be passed into VBA to do more stuff.p  pMy problem is that the report bound to the query will not update as the query does.  I have tried using DoCmd.Requery and Me.Form.Refresh on the button click event, but havent gotten anywhere. It only works if I close the form, then reopen it. p  pstrongHow do I get my bound report to change dynamically as the user modifies the SQL of its source querystrong p  pHeres my click event codep  precodePrivate Sub cmdApplyFiltersClick Call updateSearchFilters Me.Requery Me.Form.Refresh End Sub codepre  pHeres my sub to update the queryp  precodePublic Sub updateSearchFilters Dim strSQL As String Dim searchQryDef As DAO.QueryDef  strSQL  searchSQLstrBuilderFormsfrmSearch.tboCompID, FormsfrmSearch.tboDesc, FormsfrmSearch.cboType, FormsfrmSearch.cboVendor, FormsfrmSearch.tboVendPN Set searchQryDef  CurrentDb.QueryDefsqrySearchRes searchQryDef.SQL  strSQL End Sub codepre  pHeres my SQL string builderp  precodePublic Function searchSQLstrBuildertboCompID As TextBox, tboDesc As TextBox, cboType As ComboBox, cboVend As ComboBox, tboVPN As TextBox As String searchSQLstrBuilder  SELECT tblDocs.compID, tblComponents.Desc, tblComponents.type, tblComponents.vend, tblComponents.vendorPN  searchSQLstrBuilder  searchSQLstrBuilder amp FROM tblComponents INNER JOIN tblDocs ON tblComponents.numComp  tblDocs.numComp   Dim strCompID, strDesc, strType, strVend, strVPN As String strCompID  tboCompID.Value strDesc  tboDesc.Value strType  cboType.Value strVend  cboVend.Value If IsNulltboVPN.Value Then     strVPN       searchSQLstrBuilder  searchSQLstrBuilder amp WHERE tblDocs.compID Like  amp strCompID amp  AND tblComponents.Desc Like  amp strDesc amp  AND tblComponents.type Like  amp strType amp  AND tblComponents.vend Like  amp strVend amp  AND [vendorPN] Is Null Or tblComponents.vendorPN Like  amp strVPN amp  Else     strVPN  tboVPN.Value     searchSQLstrBuilder  searchSQLstrBuilder amp WHERE tblDocs.compID Like  amp strCompID amp  AND tblComponents.Desc Like  amp strDesc amp  AND tblComponents.type Like  amp strType amp  AND tblComponents.vend Like  amp strVend amp  AND tblComponents.vendorPN Like  amp strVPN amp  End If  End Function codepre  pThanks in advance  Let me know if theres more information I can provide.p
Negative 92809 pI am doing a question on www.hackerrank.com and I have been stuck on it for days. p  pHere is the statement of the question a hrefhttpswww.hackerrank.comchallengesinsertionsort relnofollowhttpswww.hackerrank.comchallengesinsertionsorta. Basically, I have to count how many swaps occur in insertion sort for a given array in Onlogn time. p  pa hrefhttppaste.ubuntu.com12637144 relnofollowhttppaste.ubuntu.com12637144a Here is my submitted code. I use merge sort and count how many times each element is displaced. This code passes for more than half of the sites tests. When it fails it doesnt time out, and it doesnt have a compilation error or segmentation fault. p  pFurthermore, when I got the input for one of the failed test cases Here is the input that it failed on the site a hrefhttppaste.ubuntu.com12637165 relnofollowhttppaste.ubuntu.com12637165a and tested it with this variation of my code a hrefhttppaste.ubuntu.com12637127 relnofollowhttppaste.ubuntu.com12637127a which actually runs the insertion sort algorithm counting the number of swaps along the way and checks it against the merge sort count, I pass all of the tests. Also, I have generated thousands of random test cases, and they also all pass using this test. p  pI dont think its a problem on the sites end because in the discussions for the problem other people seem to be passing the tests just fine without any questions or complaints. So maybe I am misunderstanding either the question or I am simply writing both the algorithm and the test cases for the algorithm wrong. Does anyone have any suggestionsp
