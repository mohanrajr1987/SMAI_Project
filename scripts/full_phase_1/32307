Negative 32307 pI have inherited a rather large project consisting of an application written in VB6 and several DLLs and ActiveX controls written in VB6, VB.NET 1.1 and VB.NET 2. I want to change one of the settings for one of the DLLs written in VB.NET 2 that is in its application.dll.config file, but it seems to be having no effect.p  pMy main VB6 application I will call it Alpha has a configuration file Alpha.exe.cnfig which contains settings used by my VB.NET 1.1 DLL which I will call Bravo.

Negative 32307 pMy application the bootstrap application for an installer that Im working on needs to launch some other applications my installer and third party installers for my installers prerequisites and wait for them to complete. In order to allow the GUI to do screen updates while waiting for an app to complete, I put a message pump in the wait loop using the MFCcompatible example in the Visual Studio documentation on idle loop processing as a guideline. My code which is in a member function of a CWinAppderived class is as followsp  precodeif CreateProcesslpAppName, szCmdLineBuffer, NULL, NULL, TRUE, 0, NULL, NULL,                     ampStartupInfo, ampProcessInfo    GetExitCodeProcessProcessInfo.hProcess, ampdwExitCode   if bWait     while dwExitCode  STILLACTIVE             In order to allow updates of the GUI to happen while were waiting for        the application to finish, we must run a mini message pump here to        allow messages to go through and get processed.  This message pump        performs much like MFCs main message pump found in CWinThreadRun.       MSG msg       while PeekMessageampmsg, NULL, 0, 0, PMNOREMOVE                if PumpMessage                     a termination message e.g. WMDESTROY            was processed, so we need to stop waiting           dwExitCode  ERRORCANTWAIT           PostQuitMessage0           break                         let MFC do its idle processing       LONG nIdle  0       while OnIdlenIdle                 if dwExitCode  STILLACTIVE  was a termination message processed                 no wait for .1 second to see if the application is finished         WaitForSingleObjectProcessInfo.hProcess, 100         GetExitCodeProcessProcessInfo.hProcess, ampdwExitCode               CloseHandleProcessInfo.hProcess   CloseHandleProcessInfo.hThread  else   dwExitCode  GetLastError codepre  pThe problem that Im having is that, at some point, this message pump seems to free up window and menu handles on the window that I have open at the time this code is run. I did a walk through in the debugger, and at no time did it ever get into the body of the if PumpMessage statement, so I dont know whats going on here to cause the window and menu handles to go south. If I dont have the message pump, everything works fine, except that the GUI cant update itself while the wait loop is running.p  pDoes anyone have any ideas as to how to make this work Alternatively, Id like to launch a worker thread to launch the second app if bWait is TRUE, but Ive never done anything with threads before, so Ill need some advice on how to do it without introducing synchronization issues, etc. Code examples would be greatly appreciated in either case.p
Negative 32307 pSay I want to manipulate some files on a floppy drive or a USB card reader.  How do I check to see if the drive in question is ready That is, has a disk physically inserted.p  pThe drive letter emexistsem, so os.exists will always return True in this case.  Also, at this point in the process I dont yet know any file names, so checking to see if a given file exists also wont work.p  pSome clarification the issue here is exception handling.  Most of the win32 API calls in question just throw an exception when you try to access a drive that isnt ready.  Normally, this would work fine  look for something like the free space, and then catch the raised exception and assume that means there isnt a disk present.  However, even when I catch any and all exceptions, I still get an angry exception dialog box from Windows telling me the floppy  card reader isnt ready.  So, I guess the real question is  how do I suppress the windows error boxp

Negative 32307 pWhen designinglaying out a view in Interface Builder, sometimes it would be nice to be able to open that view in its own window, rather than along with all of its parents.  Is there a way to do thatp  pA good example is when you have a long view with controls and labels and text fields, lets call this mycontent view, and this mycontent view is encapsulated inside a ScrollView.  It would be nice to be able to open this mycontent view in a separate window, sized to the entire size of mycontent view, rather than to see it inside the smaller window that is sized to the parent views, including the ScrollView.  That limits you to only seeing and being able modify, the top portion of mycontent view.p  pThe work around right now is to make mycontent view a toplevel view with no parents, and at runtime to addSubview it to the ScrollView.p  pAnyway to select a viewsubview in Interface Builder and open in its own window instead of the default open with familyp

Negative 32307 pQuick personal background I was hired a few months ago as the sole .NET developer C by a company whose other devs are all php devs. A week into the job I was told they wanted to switch to Java instead of doing .NET. Not an ideal situation, but Im trying to make it work.p  pI dont think I understand the relation between a projects library and the class path. I am using NetBeans 6.7.1 for development. My current project is to create an application that will update multiple merchant sources eBay, Amazon, etc. I created a Class Library project that handles scheduling of these updates. Well call it Update. p  pI am in the process of creating Class Library projects for the various sources e.g. eBay. I added the ebay project to the Update project as a Library. In the IDE there is a box that says Build Projects on Classpath which is checked. p  pFinally, right now I have a little console app that has the Update project referenced as a Library so the ebay project is now 2 libraries deep in the same manner. It works with code in the Update project.p  pThis works OK until I get to instantiating a class from the Update project via the console app that is in the ebay project. At that point I get a p  precodeException in thread main java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError codepre  pwhich is p  precode Caused by java.lang.ClassNotFoundException   at java.net.URLClassLoader1.runURLClassLoader.java200   at java.security.AccessController.doPrivilegedNative Method   at java.net.URLClassLoader.findClassURLClassLoader.java188   at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClassClassLoader.java307   at sun.misc.LauncherAppClassLoader.loadClassLauncher.java301   at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClassClassLoader.java252   at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClassInternalClassLoader.java320 codepre  pThese projects all build fine but this runtime exception is killing me. I dont know if I really understand what adding a Library to a project does and if there is something more I need to do to make the class accessible. Im used to being able to add a reference to a DLL and being good to go. I dont understand why I dont get any compiler errors or build errors but I get run time errors about accessibility. Im guessing the classpath is a missing piece that I dont understand too well, although I suppose its possible this problem has to do with something else entirely.p

Negative 32307 pI am designing an interactive installation for a gallery where I will receive input telling me which of 8 input transducers have been bridged. For example if someone touches strip number 1, I will be able to detect that. For convenience lets notate that as 1. If they touch 1 and 2 simultaniously, I will be able to detect that connection, lets call that 12. If one person touches strips one and 2, and another touches strips 3 and five, I can detect the state 12, 35.p  pIn these lists of connections, any overlap between the sets will just create a union of the sets ie. 12, 23 would never be detectable, instead I would see 123.p  pMy job is to write code that makes events happen in response to these conditions. I will be polling the input and getting a list of groups of touched strips and then ...p  pSo my questions are  what are the interesting properties of lists of subsets like this What kind of patterns can I watch for What is the formula for enumerating the list of possible groups of connections The richer my insight into the properties of this data, the better I can map it to interesting and appropriate events. Mapping can be memoryless ie. deterministic for a given input state or it could reply to sequences, or even the timing of sequences. I have a few clues of directions I could take this, but I am hoping some folks with a bit more knowledge of algorithms and sequences will be able to give me some pointers here.p

Negative 32307 pI have a scenario where I have several thousand instances of data. The data itself is represented as a single integer value. I want to be able to detect when an instance is an extreme outlier. p  pFor example, with the following example datap  precodea  10 b  14 c  25 d  467 e  12 codepre  pcodedcode is clearly an anomaly, and I would want to perform a specific action based on this.p  pI was tempted to just try an use my knowledge of the particular domain to detect anomalies. For instance, figure out a distance from the mean value that is useful, and check for that, based on heuristics. However, I think its probably better if I investigate more general, robust anomaly detection techniques, which have some theory behind them.p  pSince my working knowledge of mathematics is limited, Im hoping to find a technique which is simple, such as using standard deviation. Hopefully the singledimensioned nature of the data will make this quite a common problem, but if more information for the scenario is required please leave a comment and I will give more info.p  hr  pEdit thought Id add more information about the data and what Ive tried in case it makes one answer more correct than another.p  pThe values are all positive and nonzero. I expect that the values will form a normal distribution. This expectation is based on an intuition of the domain rather than through analysis, if this is not a bad thing to assume, please let me know. In terms of clustering, unless theres also standard algorithms to choose a kvalue, I would find it hard to provide this value to a kMeans algorithm.p  pThe action I want to take for an outlieranomaly is to present it to the user, and recommend that the data point is basically removed from the data set I wont get in to how they would do that, but it makes sense for my domain, thus it will not be used as input to another function.p  pSo far I have tried threesigma, and the IQR outlier test on my limited data set. IQR flags values which are not extreme enough, threesigma points out instances which better fit with my intuition of the domain.p  hr  pInformation on algorithms, techniques or links to resources to learn about this specific scenario are valid and welcome answers.p  pWhat is a recommended anomaly detection technique for simple, onedimensional datap

Negative 32307 pi am using MaxUserPort setting with 65000 as its value in the registry on one of my servers windows 2003 server. this was done to enable the box to handle a certain load profile. the setting has been working fine, along with the TcpTimedWaitDelay setting set at 30. p  pi have setup the same settings on another windows 2003 server box, in a different environment and have been doing some load tests. when i check netstat during the load test, i see a whole bunch of connections in TIMEWAIT state and only a few connections in ESTABLISHED state. p  pat this point, i see connection errors from the application and this makes me wonder, if the box is really using the MaxUserPortTcpTimedWaitDelay settings that i have in the registry.p  pIs it possible that the box is still using its default 5000 ports, 240 seconds wait delay values and not using the registry valuesp  pthe total number of lines in the netstat output shows about 4000 lines. if i were to consider each line corresponding to a port, i would think, it is still under 5000 and this makes me think, that the server is still operating with the 5000 port default setting. please correct me if i my assumption is incorrect.p  pis there some way to verify that the box is using these registry settings p  pplease suggest, if you have come across a situation like this, and if there is a way to troubleshoot this.p  pthank you.p  pRelated discussion p  pa hrefhttpblogs.technet.comtristankarchive20080311maxuserportwhatitiswhatitdoeswhenitsimportant.aspx relnofollowhttpblogs.technet.comtristankarchive20080311maxuserportwhatitiswhatitdoeswhenitsimportant.aspxap  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1745862maxoutgoingsocketconnectionsinnetwindowsserverhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1745862maxoutgoingsocketconnectionsinnetwindowsserverap  pa hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarycc29684528BTS.1029.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarycc29684528BTS.1029.aspxap

Negative 32307 pIm using OpenGL ES 1.1 to render a large view in an iPhone app. I have a screenshotsave function, which basically creates a new GL context offscreen, and then takes exactly the same geometry and renders it to the offscreen context. This produces the expected result.p  pYet for reasons I dont understand, the amount of time measured with codeCFAbsoluteTimeGetCurrentcode before and after that the actual draw calls take when sending to the offscreen buffer is emmoreem than an emorder of magnitudeem longer than when drawing to the main framebuffer that backs an actual UIView. All of the GL state is the same for both, and the geometry list is the same, and the sequence of calls to draw is the same.p  pNote that there happens to be a LOT of geometry here the order of magnitude is clearly measurable and repeatable. Also note that Im emnotem timing the codeglReadPixelscode call, which is the thing that I believe actually pulls data back from the GPU. This is just a mesaure of the time spent in e.g. codeglDrawArrayscode.p  pIve triedp  ul liRender that geometry to the screen again just after doing the offscreen render takes the same quick time for the screen draw.li liRender the offscreen thing twice in a row both times show the same slow draw speed.li ul  pIs this an inherent limitation of offscreen buffers Or might I be missing something fundamental herep  pThanks for your insightexplanationp

Negative 32307 pGiven an array codeAcode of codeNcode nonnegative numbers, Im interested in finding the number of ways you can pick 5 numbers from distinct positions in the array such that their sum is codeScode.p  pThere is an easy solution in codeON3codep  precodeLet H be a hash table of sum, position of leftmost element of sum for i  0, N     for j  i  1, N         H.addA[i]  A[j], i  numPossibilities  0 for i  0, N     for j  i  1, N         for k  j  1, N             numPossibilities  H.getS  A[i]  A[j]  A[k], k codepre  pWhere codeH.getx, ycode returns the number of elements in the hash whose sum has the same hash as codexcode and whose leftmost element is bigger than k.p  pAlternatively, we can add sums of 3 elements to the hash table and then continue with 2 nested for loops. The complexity remains the same however, and we just use more memory.p  pAssuming the inputs will be fairly random so no worstcase hashing, is there an algorithm that can solve this in codeON2code or maybe codeON2 log Ncode, or even codeON3code if it holds in all cases Im thinking binary searching might help, but I dont see how to deal with overlapping indexes.p  pThe above solution is a lot better in practice than the naive 5forloops solution, however I have a feeling we can do a lot better, hence this question.p  pIf you can prove that no such algorithm exists, how can the above solution be optimizedp  pstrongClarificationstrongp  pThe above algorithm is indeed codeON5code in the worst case, such as when the given array contains nothing but the number 1 and we have codeS  5code. On average however, the codeH.getcode method is a lot closer to codeO1code, hence my average cubic complexity.p  pIf you implement this and run it on 1000 random numbers in a big interval say 0 upto Int32.MaxValue, you will see that it runs relatively fast. Still, its not hard to find inputs for which it takes a long time. Even if we cant get it running fast enough for all equal numbers, what optimizations could we makep  pstrongUnder the same assumptionsstrong, can we do better, asymptotically or at least in practicep

Negative 32307 pFor a user content website I am creating, it has lots of subsections Movies, Jobs, People, Photos, Mail, etc. Its like a yahoo portal but very very detailed with information search, like I a niching as deep as possible per topic unlike any site out there. I have the site being developed in codeignitor php and mysql. Search can be global across all subsites and per subsection as we see on google, yahoo. There are 22 possible user content objects on my system, each has about 1215 search fields which i call object meta data  I a storing historical data like user content version control also which i want to include in the search.p  pNow the question is for per subsection search it seems reasonable because the scope is limited so I think I can pull it off well with mysql. I dont foresee any performance issue. But for site wide search it will search not just title names, but keywords, tags, description, including peoples mail, comments, historical data etc. So my worry is performance. Since this is a startup, I have limited hardware resources, so I have to depend 100 on the database and code to pull it off.  p  pSo what are the best practices for implementing such a search from the code and database point of view and should a mixture of databases be used depending on the subsite Currently everything is stored in 1 mysql database. But I see issues where it may work fine for people search, movies search, etc but not if i include mail search, geo locations, historical data search and even having to go searching items like photo tags, photo descriptions, etc  all part of the global search there can be performance issues due to the high number of joins and number of rows.p

But this leads to a lot of data inserted and performance stress on the database. And even more of data inserted after clicking on mark all as read. If all users would have read all posts, this would mean users count  posts count rows in the database.p  pThis method could be optimized to store timestamp for each thread and each user and update these timestamps each time user reads new posts. But its still a lot of data.This would mean users count  thread count rows.p  pI can simplify this to storing last visited timestamp on the forum i.e. thread category level. This would mean users count  forum count, which is not that bad, but there is a question when should I update this timestamp, so its not too much confusing for users.p  pThanks for any ideas.p

That is, for instance I create a data row in Transaction 1 and, before commiting it, I can read the data in Transaction 2.p  pThe fact is that I cant get to read volatile data from one in another.p  ul liIf I create strong1 connectionstrong with strong2 transactionsstrong I get an exception because SQL Server does not support parallel transactionsli liIf I create strong2 connectionsstrong with strong1 transactionstrong each, no matter the value of IsolationLevel, the program stops when I try to access data in connection 2 while connection 1 is in transaction. As connection 1 leaves the transaction, the program continues.li ul  pSo.. strongWhats the use of IsolationLevelstrongp  pPS Im not talking about distributed transactions here, just the simple SqlTransaction.p

Negative 32307 pSo within my project tracked by subversion, I have a folder lets call it codeautogeneratedcode that is as the name might suggest automatically created from a GUI program its a bunch of xml files in a few nested directories. My project is designed to work in tandem with this GUI program, so Id obviously like to keep any configurations from it in version control. Its already added and committed, so each directory has its own code.svncode folder already.p  pThe problem comes each time I want to update the codeautogeneratedcode directory with all those new nested files. I cant just copypaste the entire directory over from the GUI programs location, because then all the code.svncode folders would be overwritten.p  pThe lazy approach is to go into each folder sidebyside and manually just copy over the files for the base directory and every subdirectory therein. Obviously this is incredibly tedious.p  pShort of just writing a bash script to do this for me, is there any codesvncode command that I can use that wont completely break all the nested code.svncode directories in the alreadytracked folderp

Negative 32307 pSo I have streaming video coming in, and I want to know when it is buffering.  This is fundamentally not that hard, just adding an EventListener for some type of buffering event, but I was wondering if this is necessarily the best way to do it.p  pMy other thought was setting up a timer that polls the video feed every X milliseconds asking it if the video isBuffering, or somesuch.  While I could, in the worst case, wait the full X milliseconds before querying the video stream, Ive decided that this doesnt iactuallyi matter to me I can work around it, and indeed do so quite naturally already.p  pSo Im asking is there substantial overhead involved in having an EventListener assuming I already have quite a few, or is the advantage of catching the buffering event right away sufficiently appealingp

Negative 32307 pIm trying to generate some axis vectors from parameters commonly used to specify crystallographic unit cells.  These parameters consist of the length of the three axes a,b,c and the angles between them alpha,beta,gamma.  By convention alpha is the angle between the b and c axes, beta is between a and c, and gamma between a and b.p  pNow getting vector representations for the first two is easy.  I can arbitrarily set the the a axis to the x axis, so aaxis  [a,0,0].  I then need to rotate b away from a by the angle gamma, so I can stay in the xy plane to do so, and baxis  [bcosgamma,bsingamma,0].p  pThe problem is the third vector.  I cant figure out a nice clean way to determine it.  Ive figured out some different interpretations but none of them have panned out.  One is imagining the there are two cones around the axes axisa and axisb whose sizes are specified by the angles alpha and beta.  The intersection of these cones create two lines, the one in the positive z direction can be used as the direction for axisc, of length c.p  pDoes someone know how I should go about determining the axiscp  pThanks.p

Switched to a new branch branch1p  pHeres my question, put as verbosely as possible to clarify whats confusing me... By virtue of having branch1 set up to track remote branch branch1 from origin, is branch1 thus considered a remotetracking branch  If so, doesnt this conflict with the fact that originbranch1 was already listed as a remote tracking branch when running git branch r  From what I understand, there exist either local topic branches or remotetracking branches.  When running git checkout b branch1 originbranch1, am I creating a local topic branch onto which I can add commits that is tracking a remote branch by way of fetches  Running git branch now gives  branch1, and running git branch r still gives originbranch1 and originbranch2.  I created branch1 to add commits to and to track originbranch1.  Which is considered the remotetracking branch, branch1 from the output of git branch, or originbranch1 from the output of git branch rp

Negative 32307 pIm programming a game in the C XNA framework and something has been bugging me for quite some time.  Im never certain whether its to the advantage of a program to save data that is to say, store it within a local variable or to calculate it each frame.  p  pWhile Ive decided that its better to continuously calculate data that changes each frame such as the position of the player, the positions of automated sprites, et cetera, Im uncertain whether or not I should save a piece of data like the width of a window or calculate it each frame.  My fear is that calculating a piece of data, regardless of how small it may be, sixty times every second will generate quite a bit of overhead, so thus far Ive been sticking to saving a lot of material.p  pHeres an example of what Im trying to get acrossp  precode  Scenario 1 Save the data    This class represents an entry within a menu. public class MenuEntry        The constructor takes a SpriteFont variable to calculate the size of        the given string which is the text used to represent this entry in a        menu and save that data for later access     public MenuEntrystring entryText, SpriteFont font              this.entryText  entryText            Initializes a local value of the font to lessen the burden of method calls.

So, is it better to save more data to an object in the case of the example, save a rectangle structure or is it better to calculate this data each frame  Note that the data Im speaking of doesnt change between frames.p
Negative 32307 pIve written a working program in Python that basically parses a batch of binary files, extracting data into a data structure. Each file takes around a second to parse, which translates to hours for thousands of files. Ive successfully implemented a threaded version of the batch parsing method with an adjustable number of threads. I tested the method on 100 files with a varying number of threads, timing each run. Here are the results 0 threads refers to my original, prethreading code, 1 threads to the new version run with a single thread spawned.p  precode0 threads 83.842 seconds 1 threads 78.777 seconds 2 threads 105.032 seconds 3 threads 109.965 seconds 4 threads 108.956 seconds 5 threads 109.646 seconds 6 threads 109.520 seconds 7 threads 110.457 seconds 8 threads 111.658 seconds codepre  pThough spawning a thread confers a small performance increase over having the main thread do all the work, increasing the number of threads actually emdecreasesem performance. I would have expected to see performance increases, at least up to four threads one for each of my machines cores. I know threads have associated overhead, but I didnt think this would matter so much with singledigit numbers of threads.p  pIve heard of the global interpreter lock, but as I move up to four threads I do see the corresponding number of cores at workwith two threads two cores show activity during parsing, and so on.p  pI also tested some different versions of the parsing code to see if my program is IO bound. It doesnt seem to be just reading in the file takes a relatively small proportion of time processing the file is almost all of it. If I dont do the IO and process an alreadyread version of a file, I adding a second thread damages performance and a third thread improves it slightly. Im just wondering why I cant take advantage of my computers multiple cores to speed things up. Please post any questions or ways I could clarify.p

Negative 32307 pI have read several articles on when to use nested classes, but none that Ive found address my specific question.p  pC has a class called XmlReader which only provides a Create method.

FxCop blew up in my face over this and I was hoping to get some clarification on why.p  pIt mentioned not to use nested classes, but instead namespaces.  Is there a way to accomplish this with namespacesbr EDIT  Specifically, the message is  NestedTypesShouldNotBeVisible.  Resolution  Do not nest type CompiledLoaderBaseCompiledLoaderV1. Alternatively, change its accessibility so that it is not externally visible.  Info  Do not use public, protected, or protected internal nested types as a way of grouping types.  Use namespaces for this purpose.  There are very limited scenarios where nested types are the best design.  Now, I believe Jon Skeet identified that you cannot accomplish this with namespaces.  I just wanted to make sure since this error says that there are a limited scenarios where this is the best design, so if there is a better one, Im open to ideas Dp  pAlso, it did not like virtual call chain called from constructor.  Is there a reason for this  Is there a way around it EDIT  Specifically, the message is  DoNotCallOverridableMethodsInConstructors.  Resolution CompiledLoaderV2.CompiledLoaderV2String contains a call chain that results in a call to a virtual method defined by the class. Review the following call stack for unintended consequences Info  Virtual methods defined on the class should not be called from constructors. If a derived class has overridden the method, the derived class version will be called      before the derived class constructor is called.  I feel like this emcouldem be a problem if the subclasses did something in their constructors, but since they do not, Im not sure this is an issue.  Is there a better way to force the classes to load in a certain way without using abstract methods in the constructorp  pThanks so much for all your helpp
Negative 32307 pI have a page of categories, when the user clicks one, the items under that category are loaded via a jQuery Ajax call, in a table, and stuck into an element just below the category.

Is this possible using something like the HTML5 History API Ideally it would work in IE6 too as there are a lot of people using old versions of IE.p  pI know browsers have Private Browsing modes, but most people dont know about them, so some automatic way would be best.p  pOne potential although less preferred solution would be to prompt people to use Private Browsing mode if they arent currently do so. Is it possible to detect this via JavaScriptp  pstrongEDITstrong Ive accepted Virgils answer as eduction is the best option as they may need to apply what they learnt to other sites too. Ive also used Josephs codelocation.replacecode on the emhide my visitem button so it disables the back button.p  pOne interesting thing to note is I tried using codehistory.replacecode on all links on the site thinking this would replace all browser history meaning only the last page viewed was remembered. However opening the history panel in Firefox  not tested in other browsers  still showed a log of every page viewed, they were just inaccessible via the back button.p  pSo, for anyone with a similar query, Id like to reiterate that educating the user is the first step in protecting them.

Negative 32307 pThe application I am working on is relying on Autofac as DI container and one of the reasons that made me decide to use it, among others, was the delegate factory feature see a hrefhttpcode.google.compautofacwikiDelegateFactories titleherehereap  pThis works fine for all cases where I need to recreate the same elements several times as is the case of some reports and related screens. Some reports even those of the same type are executed concurrently but they change only by their userdefined parameters so it makes sense I think to inject factories in order to create instances, passing the free parameters and leave the rest to the application.p  pThe problem comes with the fact that each report is made of a variable number of sub reports tasks and each task implements an ITask interface. Each report may have up to 50 different tasks to use and each task encapsulates a precise business operation. One option I have is to inject delegate factories for and create them when needed.p  pThese tasks have to be dynamically generated by factories and something likep  precodevar myTaskA  taskFactoryConcreteTaskA var myTaskB  taskFactoryConcreteTaskB var myTaskC  taskFactoryConcreteTaskC ... var myTaskZZ   taskFactoryConcreteTaskZZ codepre  prequires a lot of manual wiring delegates, constructor, backing fields etc while something like p  precodevar myTaskA  taskFactory.CreateltConcreteTaskAgt var myTaskB  taskFactory.CreateltConcreteTaskBgt var myTaskC  taskFactory.CreateltConcreteTaskCgt ... var myTaskZZ  taskFactory.CreateltConcreteTaskZZgt codepre  pwould be incredibly less work especially if the taskFactory wraps the container as shown in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1770113howdoiimplementadelegatefactorythis other posta, but also it would basically mean I am using a service locator to create my tasks.p  pWhat other options do I have that may be suitable to solve thisp  pNOTE there is a good chance I am completely off track and that I have to read a lot more about DI, in which case any contribution would be even more importantp

Negative 32307 pIm experiencing some problems with a live wallpaper application that im writing.p  pIm using OpenGL 1.0 for rendering. In general the performance that im getting is pretty decent. On a Samsung Galaxy S2 2.3.4 i can get 60 FPS without frame limiting. p  pHowever from time to time i get some frames that are considerably larger than others lets say a normal frame is 33ms and a spike frame is around 70100ms. This happens on regular intervals, roughly once every second.p  pMy code does exactly the same processing every frame so this behavior is abnormal. It looks like that my thread is being swapped  delayed by the OS for some reason or just the VM starts executing slower at some point.p  pThe slowdowns are not due to GPU processing as eglSwapBuffers never waits. Im also pretty sure that my process does not cause the GC to run because i make sure not to have any short lived objects in my loop verified in DDMS allocation tracker.p  pAn interesting thing is that if i keep my finger on the screen the spikes in the frame time tend to get considerably smaller. As if the OS boosts the priority of the process because of this.p  pSolving this issue is very important because my animations look very bad when a spike occurs.p  pDid anyone else experience the same issue Any hints as to what might be causing the problem would also be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 32307 pIn my application each of my users is required to select a suburb to which to associate their profile. The codeuserscode table has a field codesuburbidcode and a table called codesuburbscode has both an codeidcode and codenamecode field.p  pOur codesuburbscode table contains most of the suburbs that we will need, however occasionally users will need to enter suburbs that we dont have in our table, or have popped up since we populated our table.p  pWhat is the best way in terms of database design to solve this problem.p  pI had considered changing the field codesuburbidcode to just codesuburbcode and then testing in the application whether it was an integer or a string  if it was an integer the application would assume it is related to an item in the codesuburbscode table, if it was a string it would assume otherwise.

Negative 32307 pI have a Windows Forms control a subclass of codePanelcode that serves as a panel that displays an image.

When that button is pressed, the screenshot is saved as the background of the Windows Forms control, and then the application is shown again.

Yes, you may think, that this is absolutely wrong statement, because there is no street without at least one house, but this is just an analogy, so please, just accept it as it is.p  pHere is the strongemnewemstrong data file, with the double linesp  precode0 0     lt Group 1  1 house 0 and 1 room 0  0 0     lt Group 2  2 houses 01 and 3,2 rooms 0,1,20,1 0 1 0 2     1 0     lt house 2 in Group 2, with the first room 0 1 1     lt house 2 in Group 2, with the second room 1  0 0     lt Group 3 0 1     lt house 1 in Group 3, with the second room 1 0 2  0 0     lt Group 4 1 0     lt house 2 in Group 4, with one room only 0 2 0 3 0     lt house 4 in Group 4, with one room only 0  0 0     lt Group 5         lt Group 6 ltlt  THIS IS THE NEW GROUP  0 0     lt Group 7         lt Group 8 ltlt  THIS IS THE NEW GROUP  0 0     lt Group 9  0 0     lt Group 10  codepre  pI need to convert this into an elegant way as it has been done before, but in this case we have to take into account these new groups too, and indicate them in this way, following strongemKentemstrong for example coderoupIdx houseIdx numberOfRoomscode, where the codehouseIdxcode let equal to zero strongcodehouseIdx  0codestrong and the codenumberOfRoomscode let equal to zero too strongcodenumberOfRooms  0codestrong. So, I need to get this kind of strongoutputstrong for examplep  precode1 0 1  2 0 3 2 1 2  3 0 3  4 0 1 4 1 1 4 2 1 4 3 1  5 0 1  6 0 0  7 0 1  8 0 0  9 0 1  10 0 1 codepre  pCan we tune the previous code in this wayp  pemstrongUPDATE the new second empty line indicates a new groupemstrong. If there was an additional empty new line after the empty line, as in this casep  precode0 0     lt Group 5         lt Group 6 ltlt  THIS IS THE NEW GROUP  0 0     lt Group 7         lt Group 8 ltlt  THIS IS THE NEW GROUP codepre  pwe just treat the new empty line the second one in the 2 blank lines as a new group, and indicate them as codegroupindex 0 0code. See the desired output abovep

Negative 32307 pIm writing a wsgi application that needs to use Twisted PerspectiveBroker to call some remote methods. The problem is that the WSGI needs to return a rendered webpage, but the calls to the Twisted service are asynchronous.

Negative 32307 pIm just getting into Ruby and come from the Java and CC environment.p  pWhile coding a first little project in Ruby, I somehow got used to let all local variables start with an underscore.

Im not really sure, whether this is good or bad. Besides, in a lot other languages, the underscore would be substituted to some other character.p  pIs there somehow a embest practiceem concerning variable naming beside the usual emCamelCaseem andor emunderscore separatedem What are the habits of the professional rubyists Have I overlooked some general Ruby conventions, when I chose the leading underscorep  hr  pstrongeditstrongbr Thanks to all answers and suggestions.

Negative 32307 pHi im really a noob at django. Can i ask if there is anyway to filter list by user group When creating a user at admin, there is also choice for creating groups. After assigning these user to certain groups, i have another model e.g. Staff where Staff information is provided and is linked to the user. So very Staff must be  a user and also must be member of the group staff. I have already created a drop down menu at Staff Page for the list of users when creating a new Staff.p  pThe  problem is that i cant seem to figure out how the list of users shown at staff page can be filtered according to the user group and also assignment since it should be OnetoOne relation w the user. So users who been used or is already linked to a certain staff will not show in that list again when creating a new Staff.p  pIm thinking of using Staff.model.count to do that and  the user to Staff User Group. but where should i out in order to customize it please helpp

If it does not, then we generate the thread dump and the heap dump, before restarting WebSphere.p  pI know about the codekill 3code or codekill QUITcode command. The command would generate thread dump only if the parameter codeIBMHEAPDUMPfalsecode, or thread dump and heap dump if codeIBMHEAPDUMPtruecode.

Negative 32307 pIm trying to set up my IIS server as an origin server for a CDN. I have solved some issues already for example that IIS doesnt give gziped content to proxies if they have the via header and also that frequentHitThreshold problem.p  pMy CDN supplier pointed out that another problem with IIS is that it doesnt return a Vary header if the client doesnt request the content gziped. According to them the problem is that if for some reason the first client that request the content doesnt want the content gziped the CDN then doesnt request a new version of the file since the Vary header doesnt indicate that it should return two different files depending on AcceptEncoding.p  pMy only solution so far is to add Vary AcceptEncoding as a custom header but since IIS automatically add this vary header when gziped is requested so i end up with multiple values like Vary AcceptEncoding, AcceptEncoding.p  pAnyone have any solution to this Or can confirm that its a real issue.p

Negative 32307 pAs a way of learning Java, Im writing this little application for grade schoolers to practice basic math. The idea is that the kid does any number of math problems, as long as they are in the app, it just continues to throw problems at them until they click a Done button. When they decide to be done, I want a new JFrame to come up that will show them all of the problems they attempted, along with their answer, and whether they got the problem right or wrong.p  pThe advice that I am looking for is what is the best way for me present these results. I looked into the GridLayout and the GroupLayout, but I dont think that these are exactly right. I did something similar in VBA for Excel, and there I just ran a for loop with one iteration for every problem they attempted.

Why is this error showing upp  pI then revised my code after coming upon this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10844282appendingvaluestoakeyifkeyalreadyexistspythonjythonrq1other questiona to be like the following, since I thought this was an alternative way to accomplish my task. My code then looked like thisp  precodedef createdDictlist, file       f  openfile, r     d     i0       for line in f         groupIndex  intline         if groupIndex in d             d.setdefaultgroupIndex, [].appendlist[i]         else             d[groupIndex]  list[i]         i 1     print d     f.close codepre  pThis code snippet doesnt end in an error or what I want, but rather what I believe are the last objects in the groups... so codeprint dcode gives me the key and the last object placed in the group instead of the desired ALL of the objects in that group and then terminal randomly spits out codegroupIndexcode followed by all of the objects in codelistcode. p  pMy question what exactly am I missing here People upvoted the answers to the questions I linked, so they are most likely correct and I am likely implementing them incorrectly. I dont need a correction to both procedures, but the most efficient answer to my problem of getting multiple values attached to one key. What would be the most pythonic way to accomplish this taskp  pstrongEDIT 2strong if this helps at all, here is the class that the first method is referencing the error too. I have no idea how it defined any part of this code as a part of this class.

I came across following post on stackoverflow p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7991034iphonefacebooksidemenuusingobjectiveciphone facebook side menu using objective cap  pIn which I want to implement the solution given by greenisus up voted 15 times but I am having the trouble implementing that, same trouble has been raised by Bot in comments to his answer.  greenisus Im confused on how you sent the menu to the back When I do that it just shows a black side menu. which has not been answered. p  h2The text of his answer for reference ish2  pIts pretty simple really. First, you need to make a view controller that sits under the one thats visible. You can send that view to the back like thisp  precode[self.view sendSubviewToBackmenuViewController.view] codepre  pThen, you put a menu button on the left side of your navigation bar, and write a handler kind of like thisp  precode voidmenuButtonPressedidsender      CGRect destination  self.navigationController.view.frame     if destination.origin.x gt 0          destination.origin.x  0      else          destination.origin.x  254.5          [UIView animateWithDuration0.25 animations         self.navigationController.view.frame  destination              completionBOOL finished          self.view.userInteractionEnabled  destination.origin.x gt 0     ]  codepre  h2Thats the general idea. You may have to change the code to reflect your view hierarchy, etc.h2  pJust want to know when we have to use the following method, the second method is simple and works fine, but doesnt show menu view under it.p  precode[self.view sendSubviewToBackmenuViewController.view] codepre  pLooking for some pointers or solution to run the above code correctly. p

Negative 32307 pI am writing a Powershell script to automate the setting up of a Windows 2008 R2 server and one thing that is required is the importing of several certificates into different stores. After doing some research on how best to achieve this, I found that Importpfx.exe was the best choice for what I am aiming to do, which is import one .pfx file into the Trusted People store  and another .pfx file into the Personal store, both for the Computer account. I then also need to Manage Private keys on the certificate imported into the Personal store once it has been imported. p  pAt first, I thought that Importpfx.exe was doing this correctly, but after researching on how to manage the private keys via Powershell, I learned that this can be done my editing the acl for the file that corresponds to the imported certificate which should be found here CProgramDataMicrosoftCryptoRSAMachineKeys. This is where I started to notice that something wasnt quite right with the imported certificate. After searching this folder for a new file after importing the certificates, I noticed that no new files had been added to this folder. p  pI searched the entire C drive for all files sorted by date modified and found that new files had been added to this folder CUsersuserAppDataRoamingMicrosoftCryptoRSAS15212545654756342472812410461640304917 instead of the expected folder. Whilst I was able to manually manage private keys for the certificate via the certificate store as I was user who imported it, no other users were able to log onto the machine and manage the private keys, getting the error message Cannot find the certificate and private key for decryption which would make sense given the folder that the corresponding file exists in.p  pI use a function to get the thumbprint of the certificates before trying to import the .pfx file.

Negative 32307 pI have a method that reads a list of messages from a message queue. The signature isp  precodeIListltTMsggt ReadltTMsggtMessageQueue queue, int timeout, MessageQueueTransaction tx codepre  pThe basic functionality is that it will reads as many messages as it can from the queue, within the timeout, using the given transaction. The problem Im having is deciding on how best to enforce the timeout. I have two working versions at the moment. These arep  ul liUsing BeginPeek with a timeout. If it succeeds, the message is removed with a transactional Receive call. The timeout for BeginPeek is recalculated after each call, based on the time the Read began, and the current time.li liUsing Receive with the timeout value, and catching the exception when the timeout expires.li ul  pThe problem with the first approach is that it requires the queue to be read in DenySharedReceive mode, otherwise you cant guarantee the message will still be there between the Peek and Receive. The problem with the second method is that an exception needs to be thrown and handled albeit, internally and transparently which is probably not a great design since each call will emalwaysem end in an exception which goes against the idea of throwing exceptions only in exceptional circumstances.p  pDoes anyone have any other suggestions how I might achieve this, or comments on these two techniques and my concernsp

Negative 32307 pIm trying to write loader to sqlite that will load as fast as possible simple rows in DB. Input data looks like rows retrieved from postgres DB. Approximated amount of rows that will go to sqlite from 20mil to 100mil. I cannot use other DB except sqlite due to project restrictions.p  pMy question is  strongwhat is a proper logic to write such loaderstrongp  pstrongAt first trystrong Ive tried to write set of encapsulated generators, that will take one row from Postgres, slightly ammend it and put it into sqlite. I ended up with the fact that for each row, i create separate sqlite connection and cursor. And that looks awfull.p  pstrongAt second trystrong , i moved sqlite connection and cursor out of the generator , to the body of the script  and it became clear that i do not commit data to sqlite untill i fetch and process all 20mils records. And this possibly could crash all my hardware.p  pstrongAt third trystrong I strated to consider to keep Sqlite connection away from the loops , but createclose cursor each time i process  and push one row to Sqlite. This is better but i think also have some overhead.p  pI also considered to play with transactions  One connection, one cursor, one transaction and commit called  in generator each time row is being pushed to Sqlite. Is this i right way im going p  pIs there some widelyused pattern to write such a component in python Because I feel as if I am inventing a bicycle. p

Negative 32307 pId like to utilize a unique java collection that can accept a strategy for determining if member objects are equal on collection initialization. p  pThe reason I need to do this is because the equals method of the class that I need to add to this collection is already implemented to satisfy other more appropriate functionality. In a specific case, the criteria for uniqueness in this collection instance needs to check only one variable of the class as opposed to a number of variables that are checked in the equals method. I would prefer to avoid decorating the objects as I am gathering them from disparate libraries and it would be costly to loop through for decoration and it may muddy my code.p  pI realize this would not be a Set as it would break the a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase6docsapijavautilSet.html relnofollowJava contract for Seta, but I just feel as though this problem must have been encountered previously.

Negative 32307 pWe are in the process of expanding our data warehouse and weve come to a conundrum that nobody on the team has been able to solve. I tried searching for answers on Google, but its hard to get the right terms.p  pEssentially, the problem is this. We have a data warehouse that keeps track of items. We have to do a lot of reporting out of this data warehouse. A lot of reports are driven by categorizing these items and then aggregating data according to the categorizations. Some reports share categorizations, and some may have their own that are specific to the report. Even in that case, there may be subsequent reporting or analysis adhoc that will need to reuse these categorizations. And there will likely be a lot of these categorization schemes. Furthermore, these schemes may rely on data from more than one fact table in order to categorize an item and item information spans multiple fact tables due to different grain.p  pOur initial plan was to have dimensions for these, one for each categorization, or perhaps a junk dimension with a column for each category. And that would be fine if the number of categorizations is likely to remain static. However, there will always be new reports and analytical needs. We dont want to have to change the schema and the ETL process every time we want to add a new categorization scheme. We might also want to change the logic for a categorization without having to reimport the data or rerun parts of the ETL to recalculate.p  pSo our options seem to be as followsp  ol liJust put the logic in report and analysis queries, even if that means copying and pasting categorization logic from query to queryli liUse the dimension approach, with its flawsli liHave functions for calculating categories, which can be used in queries, but will be costly because they may have to do additional queries inside of them bad performanceli liHave views on top of the fact tables that include extra category columns the views can more easily be changed than regular table schemas, and dont require modifications to the ETL processli liUse some sort of bridge table scheme to implement a manytomany mapping between categories and items in each category this increase query complexity, but reduces scheme modifications to none ETL would still need to be modified, but the modification could probably be in a smaller area maybe a single query or procedure to update the category mappingsli ol  pWe want this system to be accessible, such that users wont need to do much, if anything, more to access these categorization fields as they would to access regular fact and dimension fields. We also want to avoid having to make a lot of changes to the schema and ETL process every time a new categorization schema is added to the database.p  pSo my question is, essentially, are there ways better than the five I listed that can be used to solve this problem Are there variations on those five that more effectively solve the problem Or is it just a hard problem that will require some degree of suffering Maybe Im going about this all wrong, so any feedback in that respect would be helpful too.p  ptldr we need ways to have a lot of different categorizations of items in the data warehouse and are not sure of the most efficient, easily managed or easy to use system.p  pEDIT additional info we are using SQL Server, with SSRS as the primary reporting frontend, and SSAS as a secondary frontend for analysis or adhoc querying.p

Negative 32307 pIm working on a web application that is powered by a restful API written with Pythons CherryPy framework. I started out writing the user interface with a combination of jQuery and server side templates, but eventually switched to Backbone.js because the jQuery was getting out of hand.p  pUnfortunately, Im having some problems getting my models to sync with the server. Heres a quick example from my codep  precodefunction      var User  Backbone.Model.extend         defaults              id null,             username null,             token null,             tokenexpires null,             created null         ,          url function              return apiusers         ,          parse functionresponse, options              console.logresponse.id             console.logresponse.username             console.logresponse.token             console.logresponse.created             return response                    var u  new User     u.saveusernameasdf, tokenasdf,          wait true,         success functionmodel, response              console.logmodel.getid             console.logmodel.getusername             console.logmodel.gettoken             console.logmodel.getcreated                codepre  pAs you can probably tell, the idea here is to register a new user with the service. When I call codeu.savecode, Backbone does indeed send a POST request to the server. Here are the relevant bitsp  pstrongRequeststrongp  precodeRequest URL httplocalhost8080apiusers Request Method POST Request Body usernameasdf,tokenasdf,idnull,tokenexpiresnull,creatednull codepre  pstrongResponsestrongp  precodeStatus Code HTTP1.1 200 OK ContentType applicationjson ContentLength 109 Response Body username asdf, created 20130207T131109.811507, token null, id 14, tokenexpires null codepre  pAs you can see, the server successfully processes the request and sends back an codeidcode and a value for codecreatedcode. But for some reason, when my code calls codeconsole.logu.idcode, I get codenullcode, and when my code calls codeconsole.logu.createdcode, I get codeundefinedcode.p  pstrongtldrstrong Why isnt Backbone.js persisting changes to my objects after a call to codesavecodep  pstrongEditstrong  Ive modified the above code so that the model properties are accessed using the get function in a codesuccesscode callback. This should solve any concurrency problems with the original code.p  pIve also added some console logging in the models codeparsecode function. Oddly enough, each of these is codeundefinedcode... Does that mean that Backbone.js is failing to parse my response JSONp  pstrongEdit 2strong A few days ago, I found out that issue was actually a custom header that I was adding to every request to enable HTTP Basic Authentication.

Negative 32307 pIve set up Flurry ads in my app and most of the time, they work great. My game has several minigames, and at the end of each minigame, I show an ad. p  pHowever, occasionally the ad does not appear, leaving the user hanging on the games end screen. I cant figure out a use case whereby this happens every time, rather it seems to occur randomly. p  pOnce the ad has failed to appear, double tapping the home button i.e. bringing up the app switcher menu has the effect of dismissing the ad, and returning to my games main screen.

Negative 32307 pIve written my own encryption method using AES in a project Ive been working on lately using PyCrypto. I use a hash to generate a 32byte password and feed that to AES256bit encryption using CBC.

This is a problem for what Im doing, as I need to have decryption fail fast if the passphrase is wrong. p  pHow can I make this happen Ive heard of other methods of AES encryption, but it seems that PyCrypto only supports ECB, CBC, CFB, OFB, CTR, and OpenPGP. How can I implement cryptographically strong AES which will fail decryption without the right passphrasep

Negative 32307 pIn my current setup, I run codeemacs daemoncode on boot and thereafter use codeemacsclientcode to do work. However, Ive noticed a problem with this. When a complex chunk of processing is happening, kbdCgkbd stops working the complex work cant be halted or terminated early. As far as I can tell, this is because an emacs client needs to wait to be acknowledged by the server before any input from the client is processed. As a result, kbdCgkbd wont work when I most need it  to bail out of processes that are timeconsuming or possibly destructive. p  pAre there any workarounds to this, or a way to tell the server process stop that Nothing in the a hrefhttpwww.gnu.orgsoftwareemacsmanualhtmlnodeemacsQuitting.html relnofollowQuittinga or a hrefhttpwww.gnu.orgsoftwareemacsmanualhtmlnodeemacsEmergencyEscape.html relnofollowEmergency Escapea sections of the manual seems to acknowledge that this problem exists  so its also possible that this is the result of me doing something wrong.

Negative 32307 pI have a large table in Mnesia and because of various reasons not important here, say that I am executing the select remotely and the result has to be send over network using some 3rd party libraries I cant select all rows in one select. I am already splitting the select to only retrieve a specific amount of columns at once.p  pe.g. this is an example of a select to retrieve only specific columnsp  precodemnesiadirtyselect[table,[table,1,,3,4,,,,[],[]]]. codepre  pI run that select twice with different set of columns and then combine the results. But now it turned out that one of the columns is also too large to be retrieved in one select. So Id like to split one large select into two selects, each retrieving only half of rows in that column. Is there an easy way of retrieving, say, every second row Something like select only odd rows, and then select only even rows Or maybe a way of retrieving the first half and then the second half of the rowsp  pI tried to select all rows from one of the columns and then use it as an index to retrieve specific rows. This works but takes quite some time to construct the select and then to execute it.p  pstrongEDITstrong Sorry that I didnt stress enough the fact that the select is being executed remotely. I know about iterating over records or accessing the file directly, but the challenge here is that those records in question have to be retrieved using a relatively small amount of commands, and that those commands have to be capable of executing remotely.p  pFor examplep  ol liSelect only the first column simple single codemnesiadirtyselectcode command.li liOnce the result is retrieved over network, split it into two sets and use as keys to construct selects to get specific records each select would contain a long list of keys to retrieve but thats fine as they are simple Erlang terms that can be send over networkli liRetrieve all rows in two steps using those two sets of keys created in 2.li ol  pThat works but is not easy and not optimal as it sends quite a lot of data both ways. There may not be an easy solution unless the selects are constructed to take into accounts specific data contained in each column and row e.g. match all rows with names in the first column starting with letters A to M. I am just not sure what is possible using standard Mnesia commands and was hoping for an easier solution.p

Negative 32307 pIm just learning Angular, so apologies if this is a noob question. Im trying to create a fixed position sidebar that will contain buttonsor links that will scroll to different elements on the page. So my first thought is the button click should attempt the scrollTo, but supposedly this is not the Angular way, all DOM mods should be done in a directive. The best example I could find is here a hrefhttpplnkr.coeditPo37JFeP5IsNoz5ZycFsppreview relnofollowhttpplnkr.coeditPo37JFeP5IsNoz5ZycFsppreviewap  pThis example places a directive on the elements being scrolled to and the links that kick off the scrolling just have  hrefs. While I get whats happening, I dont understand how adding the directive to the element actually works in this case the h3. Does the directive watch the location element and when that changes, this is how the directive is executedp  pThe anchorScroll pattern will not work for me as I have a fixed header in place and need to scroll to the element in question with a negative offset to account for the header. From what I have read about the project, this is a known issue and a fix is in the works.p

While this doesnt seem to be a problem here and might appear to be the solution, in my project this really would make the whole module messy, as the function is not related to the module in general, but as having said, very specific to that method it is used in. In other words splitting this to somewhere so far away from its context, it makes the code quite less readable, and less pythonic.p  pIs there any other way, or should I choose one of the three ways shown herep

Negative 32307 pI developed a multithread java application which using thread to process a batch of work. I have a main thread which dispatching the works to different threads. All work fine.p  pNow I have changed the application to allow it to run in multiple java process, each doing multithread processing as before. For example, I use to have 8 threads to process 8 jobs in one java process, now I can have 2 Java processes with each have 4 threads still to process 8 jobs in total.p  pThe application is modeled like this a dispatcher will fetch the work need to be done, then dispatch them to a thread pool. There is no synchronization or communication between the threads.p  pI have notice quite a big performance gain in the later approach and Im wondering why. Can anyone shed some insight on this Is the OS process scheduling much more efficient that java threads Should I use this as a general rule of thumb when I really need that performance gain thanks.p

Negative 32307 pIm on iOS 6.1.4, OpenGL ES 2, and am experiencing strange behavior with codeglGenTexturescode returning texture names which have previously been returned by codeglGenTexturescode.p  pSpecifically, at initialization time, I iterate through my textures and make OpenGL aware of them, like thisp  precode Generate the OpenGL texture objects for Object3D object3D in self.objects3D      [self installIntoOpenGLObject3Dobject3D]    voidinstallIntoOpenGLObject3DObject3D object3D      GLuint nID     glGenTextures1, ampnID      Texture texture  object3D.texture     texture.identifier  nID     glBindTextureGLTEXTURE2D, nID     glTexParameterfGLTEXTURE2D, GLTEXTUREMINFILTER, GLLINEAR     glTexParameterfGLTEXTURE2D, GLTEXTUREMAGFILTER, GLLINEAR     glTexImage2DGLTEXTURE2D, 0, GLRGBA, [texture width], [texture height], 0, GLRGBA, GLUNSIGNEDBYTE, GLvoid[texture pngData]     ARLogInfoInstalled texture  with OpenGL identifier d, texture.name, texture.identifier  codepre  pAt this time, I see texture names like code1, 2, 3, ... ncode as expected.p  pHowever, sometime later after an asynchronous network call returns I create new textures and call codeinstallIntoOpenGLObject3Dcode to install them.

Negative 32307 pIs there a REST rule or best practice to updatecreate a specific property on a resource  For example say I have a user resource. p  pusers GET gets all users, POST create a new one, and put usersid updates the user with that  id. p  pLets say I need to update a status for that person. I could just pass that in the PUT request, but problem is I want to delete the status as well. Usually with PUT I have only been updating the values passed, ie if you put with firstNameBob I would update that persons firstName but I would not delete his lastName just because it was not passed in. As well as I would not delete status if it was not passed. So I need a way to delete status. p  pSo I was thinking status was just another resource. But a very uncomplicated one. p  pusersidstatus POST to create a new status  Problem I am trying to wrap my head around is that status is just a simple name, like away or vacation. Seems weird to do usersidstatus with a body of statusaway. Ie status appears in URL and in body, seems wrong. Also with this approach POST and PUT would be identical. Maybe that is ok.  p  pI feel like I have the simple cases of REST down but this one is stumping me. p

Negative 32307 pLet suppose we have the custom codeListViewcode which extends codeonDrawcode method by drawing some rectangle in it.p  precodeclass Listpicker extends ListView  ..Some other methods here..     Override     protected void onDrawandroid.graphics.Canvas canvas      super.onDrawcanvas     canvas.drawBitmapglassPickerBitmap, null, glassRect, semiTransparrentPaint       codepre  pThe bitmap drawn represent some sort of glass which is rectangle with width equal to the width of listview and some height. What I want is when list item scrolls into this rectangle the color used for drawing text not all item with background and etc. would be changed into some another color. So, for example, when list item fits so that only half height of text fits into codeglassPickerBitmapcode, the outside part of list item should remain in its ordinal colors, and the part that is inside codeglassPickerBitmapcode should change its text color. List items are simple TextViews without any background.p  pHow can be this achieved Maybe any codeColorFiltercodes assigned to the codePaintcode But where codeonDrawcode method of codeListviewcode is not even called when codeListViewcode is scrolled... Can be this done inside customized views, for example, that will be codeListViewcodes items Or may be some ColorShaderdo not know what else overlay can be used here, but strongwherestrongp  pstrongEDIT added image examplesstrongp  pHere is example of some crop from reallife app. There are 2 codeListViewcodes one on the left side, other on the right. Glass is the grayed rectangle. Now, left list has strongUnited States Dollarstrong currency selected. And I am scrolling right codeListViewcode in that way, that selection is somewhere between emUSDem and emAfghan Afghaniem. Now, what I want, is that emUSDem currency in the left codeListViewcode would be drawn in red exact color doesnt matter now, I will change it later to something meaningful AND, in the same time, bottom part of emUnited States Dollarem and top part of emAfghan Afghaniem in the right ListView would be drawn also in the same red color.p  pThis color changing should be done in dynamic way  color should be changed only for the part of text that is under glass rectangle during scrolling of the list.p  pOK, EUR and USD here are special currencies drawn with not standard cyan color. The question is about at least text with emwhiteem color. But if it will be possible to change also cyan color it would be great.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comNT2wy.png altList examplep

Negative 32307 pI recently encountered a strange behavior in knockout.

The second select changes whether the first one is displayed.p  pTry selecting Steve or Jim in the first select and after that hide it select false in the second select. When you show it again, the value of myVar automatically changes to Dave the default value, instead of switching to the one you selected. This does NOT happen if you dont use a ko.computed but the pure observable instead.p  pIs this supposed to happen My guess is that knockout reevaluates the computed variable when it shows the select as it usually does in the beginning of the programs execution.p

Negative 32307 pI have a storm in my game, and so Ive made an ambient audio file which slowly grows into a storm and rain fades in, which then becomes a loopable storm audio file. Here is how Ive done itp  precode Play intro clip and merge into main loop var introTime  stormIntro.length AudioSource.PlayClipAtPoint stormIntro, Vector3.zero, 0.7  Invoke StormMusic, introTime  codepre  pThe way Im currently trying to do it is get the length of the stormintro audio clip, play the clip, and then invoke stormloop to begin after the length of the intro has completed. This emkindaem works, but not really because theres occasionally a gap between the two. So how can I do it so the transition is seamlessp
Negative 32307 pI have a solution that has projects both with C and CCLI code, and a set of projects which unit test all of these, using the Microsoft Unit Test Framework. For the CCLI projects, the unit test projects are C unit tests. What I currently have is a platform for 32 and 64bit. Also, for each platform I have unit test projects set to 32 and 64bit platforms to match.p  pThe issue I have is that when I switch to 32bit vs. 64bit I need to go to  codeTEST gt TEST SETTINGS gt DEFAULT PROCESSOR ARCHITECTUREcode and flip from 32 and 64 as needed. If I dont, I get a warning from Visual Studio that a 64bit image cannot run in a 32bit process. This makes sense, but surely there is some way to automate this Otherwise if I do a batch build on a build machine I will not have control of this and the unit tests will fail.p  pAlso I have tried to set the unit test projects to be AnyCPU but this fails with an error saying An attempt was made to load a program with an incorrect formatp  pIs there a better way perhapsp

Negative 32307 pIn java, we use method parameters for a number of reasons but Ive never used parameters in my methods unless I needed themp  pWhen defining a method in android for a button that I want to click, I had my method defined in XML under the Button elementp  precodeandroidonClickshowText  codepre  pthen, in my ProjectName.java file I defined the methodp  precodepublic void showTextView view      codepre  pThe View parameter is never used by me.. I have no need for it. By asking questions on Stackoverflow I was told that the View in the parameter is the view that was clicked. Button is a subclass of View as is TextView and since that is the case, that answer sort of makes sense. But the question I have is.... is this the rule for just the onClick method  Also, why can I not pass the Button as a parameter Button is the actual View being clicked, so why not Buttonp  pFurthermore, are there other methods similar to this and if so, do they all follow the rule just like the View parameter, where lets say if I had a class called A and it had a subclass B and that class had a subclass C, and if I wanted to use the onClick method, I can only pass the Highest Class as the parameterp  pTo simplify that, are there ever cases where I would pass anything else OTHER THAN View as the parameter to these methodsp  pThank you.p

Negative 32307 pI want to make my framework element, signalgraph, display the signal a DrawingVisual as a bitmap and then render the bitmap when WPF goes through a rendering pass. Im guessing I override onRender for the FrameworkElement, but Im not sure.

I then use the RenderTargetBitmap class to render the visual, and then set the output render of the rendertargetbitmap as  the source of an Image.

Negative 32307 pSo, I decided to use OpenCL for a certain program I wrote. At first, I used it just for the basic in GPU, i.e. calculating several arrays recursively, and then computing their sum in CPU. I managed to make it work, but the unnecessary PCIe made it quite slow. Thence, the second step would be to perform the sum as well in GPU, only reading the results eventually the final objective. For some reason, it didnt work well, but here comes the problem. Returning to the code which did work simply didnt work well at all Something like this p  precode 1. good code compiling gt 20s, result ok  2. Bad code compiling  gt 2s, wrong result.  3. return to good code gt 10s, wrong result, same as 2. codepre  pThese steps are interchanged simply by renaming source files, and, of course, the base code of the bad one is the same as the good one, so they indeed look the same for me. Also, I realized that changing the GPU on which the program runs to an Intel and back to a Nvidia, the problem seems to reset, and the good code runs fine again. On the other hand, reinitializing the system was ineffective no change at all.p  pAny clue on this Could the compiler or something be skipping some tasks Anyway to at least force Xcode to rerun from scratchp  pOh, I almost forgot, Im on Xcode on codeOS X 10.9code, on a MacBookPro with codeNVIDIA GeForce GT 650 Mcode as main for the purposes here.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 32307 pWhen I first launched my site, URLs were in the following formatp  precodeproject.phpprojectID1amppageID2 codepre  pA few years ago I modified my .htaccess to rewrite these to use segments, like thisp  precodeproject12 codepre  pI updated all internal links to use the segmented format, but this was good because it still supported any external incoming links in the old format. p  pNow I have switched to CodeIgniter, having my pages render using the segmented format is easy, but Im struggling to work out how to support the old querystring URLs. p  pMy attempts to support query strings natively in CodeIgniter seem to break the segmented URLs, so it looks like I cannot have both supported simultaneously. Setting up a route in CodeIgniter to redirect a query string to a controller doesnt seem to work. E.g.p  precoderoute[project.phpprojectIDanyamppageIDany]  homeprojectview12 codepre  pMy second thought was to modify the .htaccess directly to redirect the query string to the controller, like sop  pNote I am also using the .htaccess rewrite that eliminates the appearance of index.php in the CI URLp  precodeRewriteRule project.phpprojectIDdamppageIDd project12 [L] RewriteCond 1 index.php RewriteRule . index.php1 [L] codepre  pHowever this rewrite rule doesnt appear to work either. It redirects to my CodeIgniter 404 without being rewritten, and even by removing the default index.php rule it doesnt redirect, so Im assuming there is something in my regex.htaccess formatting here that is incorrect. p

Negative 32307 pIve been looking for some clarification for the usage of the strongusingdeclarationsstrong in header files I was searching around but couldnt quite get the answer Im looking for. What I my research concluded so far is, using them in the strongnonglobalstrong scope is ok, while namespace directives are bad. That I understood At least I hope so .p  pSo in my strongexamplestrong I use sharedptrs, but I need to support older compilers that do not have them in the strongstdstrong namespace but in strongstdtr1strong for example. Since every class using the sharedptr needs the same sharedptr defition, I would have to put the correct include directive and using declaration in each of these header files. So I moved this part into a seperate header file so I have only one single file where I need to make changes. The decision on which sharedptr to use, is made via a preprocessor directive strongHASSHAREDPOINTERstrong, which is set if the user has a compiler that supports strongstdsharedptrstrong.p  pstrongSharedPtr.hstrongp  precodeifndef SHAREDPTRH define SHAREDPTRH  ifdef HASSHAREDPOINTER include ltmemorygt using stdsharedptr else include lttr1memorygt using stdtr1sharedptr endif  endif  SHAREDPTRH  codepre  pNow in every header file that uses the sharedptr, I include this header file. For example inp  pstrongModelPar.hstrongp  precodeifndef MODELPARH define MODELPARH  include ltstringgt include ltsetgt  include SharedPtr.h  class ModelPar    private     stdsetltsharedptrltModelPargt gt connections   ...   endif  MODELPARH  codepre  pNow I think the way I did it is wrong, since the user that includes any of my header file using the sharedptrs also has the corresponding strongusing declarationstrong in his code. And thats the bad thing, as the user is not aware of this... etc. So I put my using declarations in the global scope. Or Im kind of stuck and confused on how to do this properly Thanks in advancep

Negative 32307 pI am using jersey client to send POST requests to a third party webservice. Since creating jersey clients is expensive, I am doing this inside the constructor of a service client class which is Spring managed. My thinking is that when my server starts up, Spring will create my service client bean, which in turn will cause the constructor to be invoked and so my jersey client will be created once. As long as the server is up, this jersey client will be responsible for sending out the requests and no further client initializations are required. However, I will be creating a new webresource for each call as creating jersey webresources is much cheaper.p  precodepackage com.mypackage Bunch of imports  class MyWebserviceClient       jersey client member variable     private Client jClient      public MyWebserviceClient          Create jersey client         jClient  Client.create          Other stuff           public void sendRequest          WebResource wr  jClient.resourcesomeUrl         Use the webresource to make webservice call       codepre  pcodeMyWebserviceClientcode is spring managed as such in the Spring config xmlp  precodeltbean idmyClient classcom.mypackage,MyWebserviceClientgtltbeangt codepre  pThe bean codemyClientcode will then be injected into the appropriate place where the service call needs to be made.p  pMy questions p  p1 If my application is dealing with thousands of requests per hour is it efficient enough to handle all the requests with just one jersey client.p  p2 Do I need some kind of jersey client pool so that a large number of requests are taken care of more efficiently. If so, is there a way to do itp  p3 I would like to know in general how multiple requests coming in from the end users are handled on the server side. Each request is a separate thread of execution on the server and all of them have access to the same jersey client object. If the jersey client object is busy with one such request, are the other requests from different end users going to wait till a response is received for the ongoing requestp  p4 Any better alternative to the one I am using.p

I can do that with the codep  precodeMKLINT localContextCsys2blacshandlelocalCommunicator  CblacsgridinitamplocalContext,                 ampcblacsGridOrdering,                 MKLINT inTaskRowLocal,                 MKLINT inTaskColLocal codepre  pwhere the above function call sequence is performed only by the tasks included in the local communicator. p  pThe codelocalContextcode value, after the call to codeCsys2blacshandlecode, is equal to 1 for each task of the local communicator but it is modified and set to 0 by the subsequent call to codeCblacsgridinitcode. p  pObviously this causes some problems in the rest of my code since, for example, if I try to retrieve the MPI communicator corresponding to codelocalContextcode with a call to codeCblacs2syshandlecode I get a six task communicator corresponding to the initial codeglobalCommunicatorcode. p  pMost likely I am making some very stupid error missing call to some BLACS functions or it is not clear to me the interplay between multiple MPI communicators and BLACS contextgrids but I can not find what is wrong with my code. p  pDo you have some suggestions concerning the above problem Many thanks for your helpp  p UPDATE 1 p  pI have an update for my question which could be useful to find a solution or at least an explanation for the observed problem the described problem is no more present if I initialize the first grid the one making use of the global context on a task grid whose size is such that all available MPI tasks are included, for example with MKLINT inTaskRow1 and MKLINT inTaskColMPICOMMWORLD size. Is this behavior expected from BLACS Many thanks again for your support   p
Negative 32307 pIm working on a binomial mixture model using OpenBUGS and R package R2OpenBUGS. Ive successfully built simpler models, but once I add another level for imperfect detection, I consistently receive the error variable X is not defined in model or in data set. Ive tried a number of different things, including changing the structure of my data and entering my data directly into OpenBUGS. Im posting this in the hope that someone else has experience with this error, and perhaps knows why OpenBUGS is not recognizing variable X even though it is clearly defined as far as I can tell. p  pIve also gotten the error expected the collection operator c error pos 8  this is not an error Ive been getting previously, but I am similarly stumped.p  pBoth the model and the datasimulation function come from Kerys Introduction to WinBUGS for Ecologists 2010.

Negative 32307 pI am trying to enable scrolling on a picturebox.  I have everything working except for one nagging little detail.  The focus shifts in an inexplicable way to the wrong scroll bar with the first click of the arrow key.  The picture box has two scrollbars which become visible when the picture being displayed is too large.  If the picture fits inside the box no scrollbars show and the vertical arrow keys behave the same as page updown keys.p  pOn the mousedown event over the picture box I set the focus to the picture box object so the user can scroll with the mouse wheel.  The user can then move the image one of three ways.  They can click and hold and drag it updownrightleft, or they can scroll with the mouse wheel vertically or they can use the arrow keys to scroll in all four direction.  If they use the arrow keys I check PreviewKeyDownEvent on the scroll bars for which key and if it is an updown or rightleft arrow key I set the focus on either the horizontal or vertical scroll bar.p  pThe problem is I see this in the debugger that when the down key is pressed as an example the PreviewKeyDownEvent handler runs and sets the focus verticalBar.Focus in this case I see the focus shift to the vertical scroll bar, but as soon as the scope leaves the event handler it shifts to the opposite scroll bar horizontal in this casep  pI am writing a form into a third party application so I could see focus going to some default control being caused by some outside function.  The odd thing is that it always goes to the opposite scroll bar from what I just set vertical if I want horizontal and horizontal if I want vertical.  Once the focus is on either scroll bar a second click on the an arrow key will shift the focus to the correct scroll bar and things will then work appropriately after that.p  pIf the focus is already ON one scroll bar or the other it will work as expected.  Focus will shift back and forth between them appropriately.

Any ideas on how I can get this to work are much appreciated.p

From a hrefhttpsgithub.comtwittertypeahead.jsblobmasterdocjquerytypeahead.mddatasets relnofollowTypeahead APIap  blockquote   pDatasets can be configured using the following options.p      psource  The backing data source for suggestions. Expected to be a function with the signature query, cb. It is expected that the function will compute the suggestion set i.e. an array of JavaScript objects for query and then invoke cb with said set. cb can be invoked synchronously or asynchronously. A Bloodhound suggestion engine can be used here, to learn how, see Bloodhound Integration. Required.p      pname  The name of the dataset. This will be appended to ttdataset to form the class name of the containing DOM element. Must only consist of underscores, dashes, letters az, and numbers. Defaults to a random number.p      pdisplayKey  For a given suggestion object, determines the string representation of it. This will be used when setting the value of the input control after a suggestion is selected. Can be either a key string or a function that transforms a suggestion object into a string. Defaults to value.p      ptemplates  A hash of templates to be used when rendering the dataset. Note a precompiled template is a function that takes a JavaScript object as its first argument and returns a HTML string.p      pempty  Rendered when 0 suggestions are available for the given query. Can be either a HTML string or a precompiled template. If its a precompiled template, the passed in context will contain query.p      pfooter Rendered at the bottom of the dataset. Can be either a HTML string or a precompiled template. If its a precompiled template, the passed in context will contain query and isEmpty.p      pheader  Rendered at the top of the dataset. Can be either a HTML string or a precompiled template. If its a precompiled template, the passed in context will contain query and isEmpty.p      psuggestion  Used to render a single suggestion. If set, this has to be a precompiled template. The associated suggestion object will serve as the context.

Negative 32307 pI had a perfectly running remote redisserver on my LAN  192.168.1.409124. I was able to use the RedisDesktopManager to view the server contents. However, there were a lot of dangling connections to my server from different clients subscribed to channels which I wanted to close so I used the codeSHUTDOWNcode command from the console of the desktop manager. Since them, I am unable to connect to the remote server. The desktop manager is running and lets me add a new redisserver connection but I am not able to connect to the previous server connection. Whenever I try to connect to the server  92.168.1.409124, the desktop manager terminates.  I have not made any configuration changes to the previously running server so I am sure that I am not making any mistake with port bindings. Any help on what I am missing will be really appreciated.p  pThanks in advance p

Negative 32307 pI need to set a codeByteArrayRequestEntitycode as the entity on an codeHttpPostcode object via the setEntity... method which expects an codeHttpEntitycode as a parameter. Via the Netbeans tip, Im casting the codeByteArrayRequestEntitycode as an codeHttpEntitycode, but Im not sure exactly why that is allowable. codeHttpEntitycode is an interface, and I am not sure that the codeByteArrayRequestEntitycode implements all the methods of that interface or if it needs to. Can anyone please clarify that this is an allowable castingp

Negative 32307 pI have a very difficult problem here, ive been trying to find a solution for this for a while but failed. Maybe this is a Phonegap limitation or the OS Browserwhich phonegap uses as webview limitation. Im not sure.. p  pOk heres my problem..p  pI have a strong4000x3000strong image resolution and my Phonegap app has a functionality to zoom an html image or html text using css3 transformscalep  pFirst of all, testing on a DESKTOP web browser, when i zoom a highresolution image and html text, the image and text gets blurry after the zoom. But after few milliseconds, the desktop browser redraws it which makes the image and text clearer. This is the default behaviour of the browser of coursep  pNow in Phonegap side, by default i display the image via stronglt img strong tag and apply a css3 strongtransformscale0.5strong to make the image smaller to fit in mobile, now when i double tap the image, i will zoom it and apply the css3 strongtransformscale2.5strongp  pThe problem in Phonegap is that when i zoom the image, phonegap does not redraw the image which makes the image blurry. Blurry Image is a big deal for me since there are texts inside the image and text when zoomed is not clear to read. p  pstrongAnd an important note, redrawing does not happen using a Samsung S3 with JellyBean OS versionAndroid, while in Xiaomi phone with KitKat OS versionAndroid, redrawing happens.

Negative 32307 pI am just trying to figure out whats the best way to manage Plugins Asset in Rails.  For Eg. Lets consider Bootstrap. p  pI understand there is vendor directory for that but even there p  pI like to keep below directory structurep  precodeApp  assets     plugins        bootstrap           fonts           css              bootstrap.css              bootstrap.min.css           js              bootstrap.js              bootstrap.min.js codepre  pI DONT LIE to follow below directory structurep  precodeApp  assets     fonts     css        application.css        bootstrap.css        bootstrap.min.css        commonstyle.css     js        application.js        bootstrap.js        bootstrap.min.js        commonscript.css codepre  pAs you can notice above, now if you start adding plugins, files goes into general folders rather grouping all assets with respect to a plugin stay together.

Negative 32307 pI have been trying to make a game engine, just to learn some new things, everything was working but I then decided that for lighting I would make my own matrices classes and pass the final matrix to the shader.

Negative 32307 pI am currently working on a project which involves benchmarking of Linux server systems and making recommendations on that which is best. The project involves running commands such as vmstat on the server versions of SUSE 11, Ubunutu 12.04 and Centos 7. The commands will be managed by bash scripts and a dialog menu box will be made to output the results for user ease.p  pHowever, we have now been advised that once the benchmarking results have been investigated and discussed, that we are to build a piece of software that holds the best of these. So for example, if the vmstat statistics are best on Ubunutu and the iostat is best of Centos and the boot time is quickest on SUSE, to put these all onto one system. Is this even possible however I am not even sure how to build my own Linux OS to store these or if it is possible within the timeframe. p  pSurely this is not possible given that the syntax is different between the server versions themselves and the only way surely would be to ping the files across to ensure that they are on just one operating system  p  pDoes anyone know if this is possible as I cant seem to see anything online to indicate that it is. p

Negative 32307 pI am using Spring Boot v1.1.9.RELEASE and I deploy my app to Heroku.  I have just added an SSL certificate and it works fine, if I manually change the URL to HTTPS. p  pThe problem is that after login, Spring Security switches back to HTTP.   Ive readup on this and found that adding the following forces HTTPS for all requests which sounds like exactly what I wantp  precode.and.requiresChannel.anyRequest.requiresSecure codepre  pHowever, when I try this, I get a redirect loop error. I dont understand why the server would constantly redirect.  I want every request to be HTTPS.  So the above code tells the server to redirect to HTTPS if the request is HTTP which seems to work.  But then it retries the redirect over and over.  Does anyone know why it does this  The logs dont seem to be providing any insight into the behaviour. p  pNote I also read somewhere that portmapping may be the culprit but the suggested solution was to set a port mapping of 80 to 443 which as far as I know is the default setting.  I tried it anyway and it made no difference.  p

Negative 32307 pAs someone who will be working extensively with JavaScript and JQuery, I hear the community is strong so I figured I would ask what a beginner should been keen in understanding when developing mobile applications. Like any other language, I wish someone would have walked in the first day of class when programming with C and said to me, if you dont learn everything about malloc and free today, you will fail Or when I was writing with Java and heard that private and static are essential for every function and variable too late. See what I mean about learning the most important so I dont get frustrated with the details later. My current attempt at figuring this question out is reading a book, but like most books, they dont expect you to ask what is the highlevel reoccurring concepts. I have used CSS and HTML and have not used scripts or Jquery as much when developing websites.p

Negative 32307 pId like to use several interactive rectangles codeimrectcode on an axis. Some of these rectangles are supposed to be connected. That isp  ul liIf the user changes the color of one rectangle, all connected rectangles should automatically get the same colorli liIf the user clicks into one rectangle, all connected rectangles should somehow be highlighted i.e., I want visual feedback which rectangles just have been selected.li ul  pI however do not know how to do this. I cant find a callback which is exectued once a color of a rectangle has been changed. I also dont know how to modify the appearance of a rectangle other than the color to show, that the rectangle has been selected. And, sadly, I dont know how to detect when a user clicked into an imrect. p  pThank youp
Negative 32307 pI write this post because I cannot find a good solution for my problem.p  pI have an activity, SearchActivity its the searchable activity, that performs a search when user submits his query in a searchview. p  pUser opens app and there is the MainActivity, that has a SearchView in Toolbar. When user submits his query, SearchActivity starts. In the SearchActivity I have ViewPager, that uses a custom adapter TabsPagerAdapter that extends FragmentStatePagerAdapter. I use ViewPager to have two fragments, one to show results in a ListView SfeListFragment and another to show results in a Map I have not yet implemented the fragment for map.p  pIn the SearchActivity, I still have the Toolbar with SearchView and user can perform other queries. When the query is submitted, the ListView in my fragment is refreshed with new results. My problem is when orientation of phone changes. In this case, if I perform a new search, ListView doesnt refresh with new data. But, if I rotate the phone, ListView refreshes with new data. Another problem is that at this point every time I do a new search, ListView doesnt refresh, but I have to rotate phone to show the new data.p  pIf can be useful to find which is the problem, I noticed that when the orientation changes, when I call getActivity, I obtain null pointer exception and so I cannot instanziate the adapter of ListView.p  pThe communication between SearchActivity and SfeListFragment is done by custom interface OnQueryChange.p  pI post my code. I dont know if my implementation is good. I ask you if you can help me to fix the problem.

Negative 32307 pMy purpose in below program is getting 16 bytes of data from microcontroller and processing data for appropriate instructions. There are a lot of related questions and answers here but I couldnt find anything about in below issue. I can get 16 bytes from MCU. Values of bytes are correct and I can see them in dataGridView but the sequence of bytes is changing . For example at first MCUData[0]  0x01 , MCUData[1]  0xFE , MCUData[2]  0xCC then it changes to  MCUData[0]  0xFE , MCUData[1]  0xCC , MCUData[2]  0x01. t is like some problem shifting my datas in byte array. I am sure my MCU is sending data correctly because I checked in one of serial terminal program.

Negative 32307 pI want to send a codePFObjectcode directly over a push notification. I send the Parse object directly inside the push e.g. with a custom key arg but I couldnt figure out how to construct a real codePFObjectcode from the received data. Received data is obviously an codeNSDictionarycode, with all the keys object ID, created at, ACLs etc available. How do I convert it to a codePFObjectcode instancep  pI need a emrealem way to construct a codePFObjectcode with the available data, so dont come with obvious solutions like send the object ID and then fetch that object at client with Parses methods. etc. I already know that obvious solution, but its timebandwidthquota inefficient as it requires a new query, while I can have everything I need in that query anyway.p  pIm looking for an automatic way, if any.

It just does not work, the fields are codenilcode even though the dictionary has all the data directly from Parse itself.p

While iterating we save the codesrccode value of each codegroupcode in a temporary variable so that we can check in the next codegroupcode if the src is the same. If so, we need to iterate over all steps of this group and the steps of the previous group. Is is only valid that the first codestepcode codestartcode elements of the second group is greater than the codestepcode codestartcode point of the first group.li liIf the codevariantcode has the value 1 or 2, then it is again necessary to loop over all groups  group and the nested codestepcode elements. Each codestartcode element of a codestepcode element must be greater than the previous codestepcode codestartcode. So if there is a codestepcode with attribute codenumber1code and the codestartcode element of it has the value 3 than the next step with the codenumber2code can only have a codestartcode codegt3code.

Negative 32307 pAssume my local server codeAcode clock is at code1822015 000100code GMT 8p  pcodeAcode sent an api request which contains parameters codestarttimecode and codeendtimecode in unix time. Eg. code1424131200code 1722015 000000 and code1424217599code 1722015 235959 respectively.p  pRemote server codeBcode stored a timestamp column called codecreatedatcode in unixtime, which means the timezone is interpreted based on the codeBcodes timezone clock settings p  pNow, codeBcode supposedly reads the timestamp parameter as it is, using the same time zone. But, I notice that codeBcode queried it wrongly. After googling for solutions, I found that because codeBcode is using UTC as its timezone. Meaning that the clock in codeBcode is 8 hours behind codeAcode.p  pSo, instead of querying code1722015  12amcode until code1722015  11.59pmcode, it queried code1722015  12amcode until code1722015  3.59pmcode. Notice the difference between the end time, 11.59pm and 3.59pm 8 hours difference.p  pI guess codeBcodes clock is always 8 hours behind codeAcodes clock at the time of api request, which is at code1722015 160100code. So, the query result always returns wrong information. It will be fine if the api request is executed the same time as the remote server. p  pI dont how to explain this, but this problem is giving me a headache to synchronize it all. How do I deal with this issue I cant seem to find any explanation on this. Is using unix timestamp in mysql server a best practicep

Negative 32307 pI will first say that I have already posted this question on a different forum, herep  pa hrefhttpwww.excelforum.comexcelgeneral1072528formcontrolodditywithrespecttoclearingfilters.html relnofollowhttpwww.excelforum.comexcelgeneral1072528formcontrolodditywithrespecttoclearingfilters.htmlap  pthough, not having as yet received any replies, I am hoping that someone here may be able to help me. I will reiterate here what I have posted there, vizp  pI have a simple table, one column of which contains Form Controls Option or Radio Buttons, to be precise, one for each row in the table, all of them having their property set to Move and Size with Cells.p  pThis is fine and good, since I can sort the table as desired and these objects remain in their respective rows.p  pHowever, Ive just noticed an issue re filtering in this table. Filtering a column is fine, as is removing that filter, embut only if the latter is done via the Clear Filter option within the dropdown itselfem. If I instead choose to use the emClearem option in the emSort amp Filterem group within the emDataem tab, then the radio buttons in any rows which were not part of that filter i.e. were hidden are not correctly resized.p  pFor example, if you access the attached file at the link provided sorry  I am unsure if I can post files on this site and try filtering on column E Assigned for No. Then see the results of removing the filter the two different ways that I describe.p  pStrangely, any sensible operation will rectify this, e.g. just changing the row height for a single row it doesnt even have to be changed to anything different  the operation itself is sufficient. Or just simply going into one of the filters and clicking on OK but without actually selecting anything and coming straight back out.p  pWhat is happening here How can it be remediedp  pMany thanks for any input.p  pRegardsp

Negative 32307 pIm struggling with the security components of symfony. I want to achieve an authentication, based on a third party cookie andor a traditional login form. A little more in detail First of all the application should check if the user has a cookie from an other application in our environment. In this case the app recognizes the cookie, validates it against an external api and the user is authenticated, if the session in the external api is valid. If it is not valid or the user has not such cookie the application forwards the request to the normal login form. I already tried a lot ways to implement this behaviour, beginning with a custom login form authentication provider, through custom listeners, etc.p  pCurrently Im trying it with two separated security factories. One implements SecurityFactoryInterface with custom listener and provider and the other one extends FormLoginFactory with a custom provider and the default listener.p  pHere some sample code from the current statep  pCustomCookieSecurityFactory.phpp  precodeclass CustomCookieSecurityFactory implements SecurityFactoryInterface    public function createContainerBuilder container, id, config, userProvider, defaultEntryPoint        providerId  security.authentication.provider.custom.cookie..id     container         gtsetDefinitionproviderId, new DefinitionDecoratorsecurity.authentication.provider.custom.cookie         gtreplaceArgument0, new ReferenceuserProvider           listenerId  security.authentication.listener.custom.cookie..id     listener  containergtsetDefinitionlistenerId, new DefinitionDecoratorsecurity.authentication.listener.custom.cookie      return arrayproviderId, listenerId, defaultEntryPoint       public function getPosition        return preauth       public function getKey      return customcookie       codepre  pCustomFormLoginSecurityFactory p  precodeclass CustomFormLoginSecurityFactory extends FormLoginFactory    public function getKey        return customformlogin            Create custom provider.           protected function createAuthProviderContainerBuilder container, id, config, userProviderId        provider  security.authentication.provider.custom.form..id     container     gtsetDefinitionprovider, new DefinitionDecoratorsecurity.authentication.provider.custom.form     gtreplaceArgument0, new ReferenceuserProviderId     gtreplaceArgument2, id           return provider     codepre  pservice.ymlp  precodesecurity.authentication.listener.custom.cookie     class AppBundleSecurityHttpFirewallCustomCookieAuthenticationListener     arguments [security.tokenstorage, security.authentication.manager, servicecontainer, logger]  security.authentication.provider.custom.cookie     class AppBundleSecurityAuthenticationProviderCustomCookieAuthenticationProvider     arguments [, logger]  security.authentication.provider.custom.form     class AppBundleSecurityAuthenticationProviderCustomFormLoginAuthenticationProvider     arguments [, security.userchecker, , security.encoderfactory, true, logger, customrouter, doctrine.orm.entitymanager, requeststack] codepre  psecurity.ymlp  precodefirewalls     dev         pattern profilerwdterrorcssimagesjs         security false      securedarea         anonymous          customcookie          customformlogin             provider customuser             loginpath login             checkpath logincheck             usernameparameter form[username]             passwordparameter form[password]         logout             path   logout             target  codepre  pMy main problem is, if the cookie based authentication does not work, the second type of authentication is not invoked.

Negative 32307 pIm trying to understand the usage of QStateMachine, specifically handling user events that trigger transitions.  Additionally, I want to understand the best way to implement guards.  Ive drawn a state machine below.  Its mostly sequential and not a great example of a state machine, but it would serve the purpose of not blocking since there are delays while waiting for the results of QProcess calls.  Those delays are instead handled asynchronously as timeout events.p  pThe state machine assumes no rndis connection at startup, then periodically runs a longer sequence of events to check for a connection.  Once a connection is detected, a shorter check is run periodically to make sure were still connected and if not, goes back to running the longer check.p  pThis is some basic setup code that is incomplete.  p  precode Set up state machine.  Do this so that checking for presence  is nonblocking.  Delays are handled by framework.

Then in the DetectortimerEvent, I can post a userdefined timeout event to the state machine.  I also need to start a new timer with each transition.  The actions for each transition will occur in a subclass of QEventTransition, presumably in the onTransition method.  How do I pass the Detector object to each of these unique transition objects so that the Detector is the one calling startTimer  Also, Im not sure how to implement the guard conditions on the two transitions that have them.  I see the virtual eventTest in QAbstractTransition, but dont quite see how it could be used to implement a guard.  Im pretty sure my thinking is not quite the Qt way, yet.p  pIve looked at the two books on Qt I could find from Summerfield and from Ezust and also at a hrefhttpdoc.qt.ioqt5statemachineapi.htmleventstransitionsandguards relnofollowhttpdoc.qt.ioqt5statemachineapi.htmleventstransitionsandguardsa.  The books make no reference to QStateMachine at all.  The Qt online documentation seems to me to lack sufficient example code for emgeneralpurposeem state machines.  It does a good job of showing how to use existing signals to create transitions, but not userdefined events.p  pAny help is welcome.  Thanks.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com66f3b.png altSimple detection state machinep  pEDIT I realize that I could implement my own simple state machine with a basic switch statement in the DetectortimerEvent function.

Negative 32307 pIs there a way to edit modify the exif data of the photot that are part of iOS photo library  gallery on the iPhone. Whenever I try to do that, iOS tries to save it as a separate image file. However, I would like to modify the exif data, without creating another copy of the photo. I used libexif as mentioned in the links below, however libexif lets you read and modify the data, but I could not figure out a way to store in the same file.  Gallery APIs  in IOS ALAsset, PhotoKit do not seem to provide direct access to underlying physical file. They only provide APIs using which the image content can be accessed updated or inserted. They do not seem to have  apis to modify the exif data. Also, libexif seems to work on the raw filename path.

Negative 32307 pSo i started learning python and thought for an exercise I would try to write up a little script just to see if I could.  Turns out I couldnt get it just right and would have left it, but got a little determined and now have a vendetta against this particular function.p  pIm wanting to get the code to take a raw input of a given number and from that generate all possible permutations of a list of the numbers up to it.  eg. if the input was 5 then it would generate all permutations of length 5 for [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].p  pWhat I tried was as followsp  precodefrom itertools import permutations from math import factorial  n  rawinputInput number to generate permutation list  factorialfunc  factorialn  print there are s permutations as follows factorialfunc  print listpermutations[1n], n codepre  pI know the faulty line is line 10 because of the [1n] part and i dont know how to get it to make a list from 1 to n and put that into the permutation function.  I was hoping by going [1n] it would generate a list from 1 to n in the same way that you can use it to access parts of a list from a to b with listname[ab] but it seems that isnt the casep  pSorry if this seems really trivial or is an obvious mistake, I only just started trying to learn python a few days ago.p

Negative 32307 pIm currently automating some processes that my company uses to package drivers into ISO images.  The established route uses a tool called CDEverywhere because it creates a Mac partition and Windows partition AND shares common folders between the two.  Unfortunately, the company that made CDEverywhere has deprecated its support for the tool, and there are potential licensing issues Each installation needs a license and there isnt a way to obtain new licenses...p  pDoes anyone know of a decent alternative to CDEverywhere  Ive run through Google and found some tools, but none that accomplish what CDEverywhere does. Any suggestions would be appreciatedp

Negative 32307 pLike so many of you at the moment I am moving a legacy classic ASP application from a Windows 2003 server to Windows 2008. I have this mostly working but I am unable to send email through it. This is because CDOSYS is not configured correctly. Despite about 45 hours googling and running through API documentation and even searching through all files on the filesystem and the system registry I was unable to figure out where this is set.p  pThe ASP.NET portion of the legacy application works fine. It is able to send emails to localhost without authentication which are then passed through to the mail server with authentication for sending to their destination.p  pI translated the VB6 calls from the source code into a Powershell script for conveniencep  precodeconfig  newobject com CDO.Configuration config.Load1  smtp  newobject com CDO.Message smtp.Configuration  config smtp.From  meexample.com smtp.To  meexample.com smtp.Subject  test smtp.TextBody  Message smtp.Send codepre  pThis script sends an email correctly on my original server.

The IIS SMTP server is already configured to look at this directory.p  pHowever, I am unable to figure out where these values are set. They must be set in a file or the registry somewhere but even searching through the C drive looking for phrases like Pickup and usemessageresponsetext and so on have not revealed anything. If they are somewhere I guess theyre in a binary datastore somewhere.p  pAll samples for CDOSYS involve configuring the CDO.Configuration or CDO.Message instance directly but all throughout the code our application loads the configuration from IIS, so somehow this was set at one point by someone.p  pI missed out on the classic ASP era so I am in very unfamiliar territory. That said, my coworkers who were active classic ASP developers do not know how to configure this, and the original person who set this up has since moved on. Its entirely possible that Im missing a very simple basic concept here.p
Negative 32307 pDoes anyone have any good methods for handling different versions of class libraries In my example I create a solution in Visual Studio called MyClasses.

I write application 2 and need to add another method to one of the classes in MyClasses.

So query is obviously not correct.p  pI have looked at scores of examples and they all subtly different than what I want. None of the examplestutorialsSO questionsanswers i have seen show how the model, view and template work together to get what I want. They are eitherp  ul ligetting opposite eg equivalent of photos by tag  want tags by photoli liare just query that gets the tags by photo i dont even think i am getting thatli lihave another SQLalchemy notation that includes sessions or base instead of db.modelli ul  pWhat I want as output is a photo id so i can show photo and its name etc and also show a list of tags associated with that photo eg as a comma separated list.p  pI am stumped to find a demoexampletutorialgithub project that walks me through what i need for workflow.p  pCan anyone show me example of view that can get photo id from url parameter and then query my models to get the associated tagsp

Negative 32307 pI have to build a Video Direct Memort Access that reads and writes 4k resolution video to and from DDR3. I want to use triple frame buffering clients specs but I also want to be able to read the data from the same buffer as they are being written with a specific delay due to different readwrite frequencies. From my understanding a triple frame buffer on most standard IPs like the Xilinx AXI Vdma Core IP locks each buffer for one specific function and uses the third spare buffer to switch functions in case they are not synchronized. But how can I unlock that to be able to read the same buffer as it is being written p

Negative 32307 pIm currently wrapping a C library into a language that stores wrapped memory as void pointers and does its own garbage collection. Internally each object has a struct that holds on to the void pointer, keeps track of the reference count, and cleans up the data when everything that references it goes out of scope. I have no control over this mechanism.p  pThe construction in C looks something like thisp  precodeMyObjectMyObjectCoreObject this     thisgtdata  new MyObjectData  codepre  pThen, whenever you want to access the data in your object, you staticcast to your datatype and do whatever you want to dop  precodestdstring MyObjectgetNameCoreObject this      MyObjectData myObject  staticcastltMyObjectDatagtthisgtdata     assertmyObject  NULL     return myObjectgtgetName  codepre  pThe ins and outs of the language are not really important, but thats just to give you an idea of how you wrap code in this language.p  pNow, the library I am wrapping uses boostsharedptr all over the place. This is partially to make python bindings easy to wrap as shared pointers fits quite well with pythons internal reference counting. However, to leverage that in this new language, the only way I can think to ensure that the reference counting and garbage collection dont interfere with one another, is to have a double pointer mechanism, i.e. void pointer pointing to a shared pointer.p  pDoing this, the construction now looks like thisp  precodeMyObjectMyObjectCoreObject this     thisgtdata  new boostsharedptrltMyObjectDatagtnew MyObjectData  codepre  pand dereferencing is even worsep  precodestdstring MyObjectgetNameCoreObject this      boostsharedptrltMyObjectDatagt myObject  staticcastltboostsharedptrltMyObjectDatagtgtthisgtdata     assertmyObject  NULL     assertmyObject  NULL     return myObjectgtgetName  codepre  pIve typedefd the boostsharedptr specialisations, but its still pretty clunky. I also tried to abstract away the shared pointer into a templated class, but realised fairly quickly that I was simply shifting the problem.p  pI was wondering if anyone had any suggestions for an encapsulation or a better mechanism for doing thisp  pMany thanks.p

Negative 32307 pI know this is simple question to most of you.

OTOH, Workers are designed to be very easy to TDD. If you use TDD, youll find you dont need to restart Sidekiq much at all.strongp  pBut when I restarted sidekiq no success. I am little bit confused like should I start sidekiq first to eager load the active job class or should I start rails server and then sidekiq to eager load the active job class.p  pWhich should I start first so that I dont get uninitialized constant error or RecordNotFound error Thanks.p

Negative 32307 pSo to start, we have a Windows Server 2008 R2 running multiple websites under our main domain, so it will be domain.comsite.  The sites were created by someone else using mainly PHP, with a few ASP.Net pages, and only the ASP.Net pages broke after we installed SharePoint 2013 on our server SharePoint was not installed on it before.p  pThe main issue we first saw was a configuration error referencing a problem connecting to the SharePoint farm, which was the application pool in IIS was using user credentials that could not access a part of SharePoint.  This is most likely a configuration somewhere, but I could not find out where wasnt in Global Web.Config, Machine.Config, or any Web.Config i could find.p  pBecause the User Credentials fixed that error, we received another config error that said codePlatformNotSupportedException Operation is not supported on this platform.code  This pointed to the application pool being set to classic instead of integrated, and heres where Im at.  If I set the application pool which is .Net v4.0 btw to Integrated, the error goes away, but the entire site outside of SharePoint pulls up blank.  In the developer tools in Chrome, all i see is a 500 error Internal Server Error and nothing else.p  pIf I set the application pool back to classic, the PHP pages will load up fine, but the ASPX pages will load up with the codePlatformNotSupportedExceptioncode error.p  pException information p  precodeException type PlatformNotSupportedException  Exception message Operation is not supported on this platform.  at System.Web.HttpServerVarsCollection.SetString name, String value at Microsoft.SharePoint.IdentityModel.SPTokenCache.ReadTokenByte[] token at Microsoft.IdentityModel.Tokens.SessionSecurityTokenHandler.ReadTokenByte[] token, SecurityTokenResolver tokenResolver at Microsoft.IdentityModel.Web.SessionAuthenticationModule.ReadSessionTokenFromCookieByte[] sessionCookie at Microsoft.IdentityModel.Web.SessionAuthenticationModule.TryReadSessionTokenFromCookieSessionSecurityTokenamp sessionToken at Microsoft.IdentityModel.Web.SessionAuthenticationModule.OnAuthenticateRequestObject sender, EventArgs eventArgs at Microsoft.SharePoint.IdentityModel.SPSessionAuthenticationModule.OnAuthenticateRequestObject sender, EventArgs eventArgs at System.Web.HttpApplication.SyncEventExecutionStep.System.Web.HttpApplication.IExecutionStep.Execute at System.Web.HttpApplication.ExecuteStepIExecutionStep step, Booleanamp completedSynchronously codepre  pIn this exception message, it references SharePoint configurations the site is not using.  Now this could belong in the SharePoint StackExchange except that SharePoint is working, but since this affects the configuration on a web siteapplication, I was hoping someone might have an idea where the site is pulling the configuration that shows up in the error.p  pstrongSite Setup in IISstrongp  precodeApplication Pools Sites gtSharePoint URL domain.com gtgtWebApp domain.comWebApp codepre  pThe codeWebAppcode page is on a separate application pool, and I assume it needs to run on code.Net v4.0code classic mode.  The PHP pages work fine with it set to classic, but part of the problem is the ASPX pages.  If I can find out where its pulling those configurations, Im hoping I can have some way to remove them from just the 1 site without affecting SharePoint.p  pIm hoping i did not miss anything important, but if I missed anything I will edit my post later to include more information.  I also dont fully understand how the configuration files work with sites in IIS, because it appears those configurations are inherited from somewhere.p  pstrongNote I did not design the WebApp page, and the person who did no longer works for us.strongp
