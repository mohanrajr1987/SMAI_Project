Anyways thanks in advance. i only showed the first 2 functions ... i have around 6 more of these p  precodeltscriptgt     functionc           dialog .dialog             autoOpen false,             maxWidth260,             maxHeight 85,             width 260,             height 85,             show                  effect blind,                 duration 1000             ,             hide                  effect explode,                 duration 1000                                 dialog .dialog             position                   my left, top,                 at right, top,                 of opener                                opener .clickfunction               dialog .dialog open                     functions           dialog2 .dialog             autoOpen false,             maxWidth300,             maxHeight 85,             width 300,             height 85,             show                  effect blind,                 duration 1000             ,             hide                  effect explode,                 duration 1000                                dialog2 .dialog            position                  my left, top,                at right, top,                of opener2                              opener2 .clickfunction              dialog2 .dialog open           ltscriptgt  ltbodygt   ltphp     ifemptyrow[voornaam]             gt             ltdiv  iddialog gtNaamltbrgt                 ltpgtltform methodpost  idnaamgt ltinput typetext valueltphp echo row[voornaam]gt namevoornaam  size8gt ltinput typetext valueltphp echo row[achternaam]gt nameachternaam  size8gtampnbspltinput typesubmit valueopslaan gt ltformgt              ltdivgt         ltbutton idopener border0 colorwhitegt ltphp echo row[voornaam] .   . row[achternaam]  gt ampnbsp ltimg srcedit.png width10 height10gtltbuttongt          ltphp          gt ltphp     ifemptyrow[gebooredatum]         gtltdiv iddialog2 gtGeboortedatumltbrgt         ltpgtltform methodpost idleeftijd gt ltinput typetext value namegeboortedatum placeholderltphp echo row[gebooredatum]gt size11gt ampnbspltinput typesubmit valueopslaan gt ltformgt          ltdivgt         ltbutton idopener2 border0 colorwhitegt ltphp echo leeftijd   gtampnbsp Jaar ampnbsp ltimg srcedit.png width10 height10gtltbuttongt           ltphp      else gt ltdiv  iddialog2gtGeboortedatumltbrgt   ltpgtltform methodpost idleeftijdgt ltinput typetext namegeboortedatum placeholderddmmjjjj size11gt  ltinput typesubmit valueopslaan size3gtltformgtltpgt ltdivgt ltbutton idopener2 border0 colorwhitegtltphp echo Voeg je geboortedatum toegt ampnbspltimg srcedit.png width10 height10gtltbuttongt     ltphp  gt  ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre

Positive 2944 pIve recently inherited an old MFC application and am puzzled by differences in how its dialogs are styled in different places.p  pWhen I open the .RC file and look at the dialogs in Visual Studio they look significantly different than they do at runtime.  Most notably, dialog frame and button borders both have a rounded style and the buttons have a gradient applied.  When I run the application they have a squareflat style.  Id prefer the style shown in the designer but dont know wherewhy its not being used at runtime.p  pThe screenshot on the left is from the VS designer.

Negative 2944 pstrongUPDATEDstrong Ive updated the example to better illustrate my problem.  I realised it was missing one specific point  namely the fact that the codeCreateLabelcode method always takes a label type so the factory can decide what type of label to create.  Thing is, it might need to obtain more or less information depending on what type of label it wants to return.p  pI have a factory class that returns objects representing labels to be sent to a printer.p  pThe factory class looks like thisp  precodepublic class LargeLabel  ILabel      public string TrackingReference  get private set       public LargeLabelstring trackingReference              TrackingReference  trackingReference        public class SmallLabel  ILabel      public string TrackingReference  get private set       public SmallLabelstring trackingReference              TrackingReference  trackingReference        public class LabelFactory      public ILabel CreateLabelLabelType labelType, string trackingReference              switch labelType                      case LabelType.Small                 return new SmallLabeltrackingReference             case LabelType.Large                 return new LargeLabeltrackingReference                codepre  pSay that I create a new label type, called CustomLabel.  I want to return this from the factory, but it needs some additional datap  precodepublic class CustomLabel  ILabel      public string TrackingReference  get private set      public string CustomText  get private set       public CustomLabelstring trackingReference, string customText              TrackingReference  trackingReference         CustomText  customText       codepre  pThis means my factory method has to changep  precodepublic class LabelFactory      public ILabel CreateLabelLabelType labelType, string trackingReference, string customText              switch labelType                      case LabelType.Small                 return new SmallLabeltrackingReference             case LabelType.Large                 return new LargeLabeltrackingReference             case LabelType.Custom                 return new CustomLabeltrackingReference, customText                codepre  pI dont like this because the factory now needs to cater for the lowest common denominator, but at the same time the CustomLabel class emneedsem to get a custom text value.  I could provide the additional factory method as an override, but I want to enforce the fact that the CustomLabel needs the value, otherwise itll only ever be given empty strings.p  pWhat is the correct way to implement this scenariop

Negative 2944 pI have a bit of an SQL problem. Here are my tablesp  precodeareasid, name, slaid areasgroupsid, groupid, areaprefix codepre  pThe codeslaidcode is an identifier from a different source  it is unique, but areas has its own autoincrementing primary key.p  pThe codeareaprefixcode field is the interesting one. It just contains the first few digits of the codeslaidcode and is unique. Each area can only exist in one group, so the area belongs to the group with the emmost specificem prefix. Examplep  precodeGroup 12s area prefixes 105, 110, 115, 805 Group 13s area prefixes 1, 8  Area slaid  10533071 matches both group 12 105 and group 13 1               105 is longer, so this area is in group 12 Area slaid  81031983 matches only group 13 8 codepre  pThe reason its done like this is so we can easily make a catchall group for areas which dont fall into any other group.p  pI can find which group an area is in like thisp  precode eg area with slaid 105055200 SELECT  FROM      SELECT groupid     FROM areasgroups     WHERE SUBSTR105055200, 0, LENGTHareaprefix  areaprefix     ORDER BY LENGTHareaprefix DESC  WHERE rownum  1 codepre  pemDid I mention this is Oracleemp  pGoing the other way is the tricky one Given a group Id, I want to find all the areas which belong to that group. That is, given group 13, I want all the areas that start with 1 or 8 but not 105, 110, 115 or 805 in this example.p  pThe closest Ive come is thisp  precodeSELECT a.id, a.slaid, MAXLENGTHag.areaprefix, ag.groupid FROM areas a INNER JOIN areasgroups ag     ON SUBSTRa.slaid, 0, LENGTHag.areaprefix  ag.areaprefix WHERE a.slaid IS NOT NULL GROUP BY a.id, a.slaid, ag.groupid codepre  pThat returns data like thisp  precode id     slaid    leng   groupid 583    105308400    3    12 583    105308400    1    13 584    105556700    3    12 584    105556700    1    13 codepre  pSo if I could only grab the groupid which has the longest length for each id...

Negative 2944 pIm having a lot of issues with trying to perform some core data operations in a threaded NSOperation.p  pCurrently, I have created a managed object context in my app delegate that is purely used on my threaded NSOperations. I setup a NSOperationQueue with a max concurrency of 1 so each action is performed serially. For each operation that gets data from the internet and creates new managed objects, I pass it the context to use. Once the new objects have been created, I save and reset the context for the next operation to use. However, Im intermittently getting malloc errors while doing this, and Ive spent days trying to figure it out, and it would appear to have something to do with how it is threaded.p  pThe errors Im getting can be seen in this related a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1777772coredatamallocerrorsstack overflow questiona.p  pThe malloc error is occurring when Im simply setting a managed objects property to an codeNSNumbercode object. It is also the first time Im setting that property so it is nothing that I am over releasing myself I cant figure it out at all, and I cant reproduce the error using GuardMalloc, it just doesnt occur Its as if the error is happening somewhere else that is being triggered, but I have no idea wherep  pAll I can deduce then is that the error is somehow connected with how Ive set up the whole thing. I have tried running the operation myself instead of adding it to the codeNSOperationQueuecode and it appears to work fine although it hangs the main thread.p  pI also need the context to inform other contexts in my app when saves have been made, so I observe its codeNSManagedObjectContextDidSaveNotificationcode notification. However, since saves are being performed in the NSOperation other thread, will there be problems with this as notifications are only dispatched on the thread its running inp
Negative 2944 pHey all, quick NHibernate question.p  pIn my current project, we have a denormalized table that, for a given unique header record, will have one or more denormalized rows. p  pWhen the user is accessing a POCO representing the header and performs an update, I need this change to cascade down to all of the denormalized rows.  For example, if the user changes field A in the normalized header, I need all denormalized rows to now reflect the new value for field A.p  pMy current though is to just do a foreach in the normalized header on the property set, since I already have an IList representing the denormalized rows, but I was hoping for a more elegant solution that does not involve writing a foreach loop for each normalized field that needs to propagate down to the denormalized table.p  pFYI in the pure Sproc world, wed just issue a second update command in a save sproc with an appropriate where clause  but were also trying to move away from the sproc dependencies and perform most operations in cp  pTIAp

When I use the sample code I find online, it exports the content to Excel just fine, but for some reason it also clears out all grid lines outside of my exported table.p  pFor your average excel user this is easy enough to fix, but I need this solution to work for everyone.p  pSo then is there a way to export the data in a GridView into an Excel Workbook so that it looks like it was just typed into Excel Ive pasted the code I am using below, assume that a GridView called toPrint exists and has accurate data.p  precodeResponse.Clear Response.AddHeadercontentdisposition, attachment filename  name  RegistrationForms.xls Response.Charset   Response.ContentType  applicationvnd.msexcel Page.EnableViewState  false  System.IO.StringWriter stringWrite  new System.IO.StringWriter System.Web.UI.HtmlTextWriter htmlWrite  new HtmlTextWriterstringWrite  toPrint.RenderControlhtmlWrite  Response.WritestringWrite.ToString Response.End codepre  pEDIT Found one partial solution. If I export as a commadelimited list and set the header to be a CSV file, it opens fine and all grid lines even those outside of the exported data are showing. The only problem with this of course is having to strip out every comma and newline character from my values before exporting them.p

Negative 2944 pIm having issues with concurrent usage of a shared collection with a multiplayer synchronous game Im working on. I did some digging around and found a neat threadsafe IEnumeratorIList implementation on Alexey Drobyshevskys post on codeproject herep  pa hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comKBcssafeenumerable.aspx relnofollowhttpwww.codeproject.comKBcssafeenumerable.aspxap  pAfter adopting his implementation I have even replaced all Linq queries on the shared collection with forforeach loops because the Linq queries were still using the unsafe IEnumerable underneath.p  pHeres my implementation of the SafeList, and the list itself is being exposed to as a ReadOnlyCollection to the consuming classes.p  pa hrefhttptheburningmonk.com201003threadsafeenumerationincsharp relnofollowhttptheburningmonk.com201003threadsafeenumerationincsharpap  pAfter switching to this SafeList I am seeing far less problems, but under heavy load 80 threads all of which readwrite from and to the list at different points Im still seeing InvalidOperationException being thrownp  blockquote   pThe element list has changed. The enumeration operation failed to continuep blockquote  pI have even tried using ReadWriterLockSlim in place of the lock object in my implementation of the SafeList but that proved fruitless too. The only other suggestion I have had so far is cloning the list every time a threads needs to loop through it. Im hoping to avoid cloning the list every single time as the list is being used in way too many places it might be a performance hit and might introduce other bugs that are difficult to spot.p  pGiven the time constraints Ill have to be pragmatic about it and if cloning is the safest and quickest way to go about solving this problem then Im fine with it, but before resorting to this last ditchattempt Im just wondering if anyone out there has come across something similar is able to offer some advice.p  pMany thanks in advancep  p[EDIT] Here is a little more information about the problem Im seeing as requestedp  pFor one game, there can be up to 100 or so synchronous clients connected and the game needs to message each connected client with updates every few seconds and so every few seconds this game needs to iterate through the shared list of players. When a player joins, or leaves, the list needs to be updated accordingly to reflect the changes. To add to that, the players can interact with the game and chat to other players, and every time a message is received from the player the game would again need to iterate through the same list and do a broadcast. The exceptions are typically thrown when the game is trying to broadcast messages to players read operation at the same time as many players leavingjoining write operation at the same time.p

But in this case I have to repeat myself  and this doesnt respect anymore to my initial requirement of DRY  p  pSo, how can I warp A to B by just initializing Bs new fields with default values and delegating the rest to a method in A which knows more than B about which fields of A should be accessed....   p  pIn the same waybr If A should be wrapped into C only a method in c should init Cs new fields, delegate to Bs wrap method which therefore inits Bs new fields in C and at last B delegates to A which copies its fields to the fields of C.p  pSo in the end I have a new instance of C which has the values of A wrapped and some default init values to the fields which the inheritance hierarchy has added.p

The reason is that the codeBackgroundWorker.DoWorkcode creates an object of a different class, and calls a method there which does bulk of the work. This method is time consuming. The class is one to get the directory structure, and many related methods in it which the main computing method depends on. So this class does not even know existance of the background worker, and hence cannot report progress to it. Moving functionality of the class to codeBackgroundWorkercode seems messy.

There would be 15 filters created all inheriting from a common ResponseFilter abstract base class like sop  precode All filters will inherit from ResponseFilter public abstract class ResponseFilter  MemoryStream      public ResponseFilterStream stream, Policy policy         Must be overridden in a derived class with specific Filter logic.     public abstract string Filterstring content       Overridden to cache content.         public override void Writebyte[] buffer, int offset, int count         Overridden to perform the filtertransformation before the content is written.     public override void Flush                Get stream content as a string           string content  Filtercontent            Write new content to stream       codepre  pThis would be used in the following way.p  precode Example var policy  GetPolicy var filter  new MapServiceJsonResponseFilterresponse.Filter, policy response.Filter  filter codepre  pThe advantage to this option is that the number of classes is kept to a minimum. However, it becomes difficult to reuse any filter logic anywhere else in the application should it become necessary. Additionally, unit testing the filters would require mocking the Stream, another disadvantage.p  h2Solution 2 Create Multiple Filters, Inject into a Common ResponseFilterh2  pIn this scenario, a single response filter is created. The actual filter logic or algorithm is injected into the filter.  All filters inherit from an abstract base class FilterBase.p  precode Represents an HttpResponse Filter. Renamed to avoid confusion with  the filter algorithm. public class ResponseFilterStream  MemoryStream      public ResponseFilterStreamStream stream, FilterBase filter         Overridden to cache content.         public override void Writebyte[] buffer, int offset, int count         Overridden to perform the filtertransformation before the content is written.     public override void Flush                Get stream content as a string           string content  filter.Filtercontent            Write new content to stream         All filter algorithms inherit from FilterBase and must implement   the filter method. public abstract class FilterBase      protected TransformBasePolicy policy         Overridden to perform the filtertransformation.         public abstract string Filterstring content  codepre  pThis would be used in the following way.p  precode Example var policy  GetPolicy var filter  new MapServiceJsonResponseFilterpolicy ResponseFilter responseFilter  new ResponseFilterresponse.Filter, filter response.Filter  filter codepre  pThe advantage to this solution is that the filtration logic is completely independent of any classes that implement stream. The logic can be more easily reused if necessary. Unit testing is a little simpler as well as I do not need to mock the stream.  p  pHowever, there are more classes exactly 1 and the usage is a little more complex, though not terribly so.p  pemNote Ill probably want to rename FilterBase as to avoid confusion with ResponseFilter.  Perhaps TransformBase.emp  hr  pI have several goals that I want to meet with either solution.p  ol liThe solution must be highly testable. Unit testing will be used to check for correctness of the filters. It is imperative that testing is as simple as possible.li liThe solution must easily support the creation of multiple filters 15.li liThe solution should be readable i.e., easy to maintain.li ol  pI think that solution 2 is the best solution for this given scenario. I can test the filtration logic completely independently of Stream with minimal additional complexity.  Either solution will support 2 and 3, so testing gets the edge.p  pWhat other considerations might there be  Are there better alternativesp
Negative 2944 pMe and a friend are working on an openGL game written in python, using the pyglet library.

Negative 2944 pI am trying to find or implement a ReaderWriter Lock which supports lowpriority writers, but have been unsuccessful in researching any existing solutions.p  pWhat I mean by lowpriority writer is will yield its place in line to incoming readers or normal writers.p  pCertainly will lead to starvation if there is a constant stream of readers, but this could be solved either with a timed lock variant try timed low priority writer lock and then switching to a normal lock on timeout or by changing the way readers are issued perhaps periodically halting reads for a short window.p  pIf there is any literature describing something along these lines, I have not found it.p  pIf there is a known correct solution leveraging regular locks, I would would appreciate a description.p
Negative 2944 pWe have a web service method which accepts some data and puts it in Lucene index. We use it to index new and updated entries from our asp.net web app. p  pThese entries are stored in a large SQL Server table 20M rows and growing, and I need a way to be able to reindex the whole table in case if current index gets deleted or corrupted. Im not sure whats the optimal way to retrieve chunks of data from a large table. Currently, we use the fact that the table has PK which is autoincrement, so we get chunks of 1000 rows until it starts to return nothing. Kind of like in pseudo languagep  precodei  0 while true      SELECT col1, col2, col3 FROM mytable WHERE pk between i and i  1000     .... if result is empty 20 times in a row, break ....     .... otherwise send result to web service to reindex ....     i  i  1000  codepre  pThis way, we dont need to SELECT COUNT which would be a big performance killer, and we just move up the pk values until we stop getting any results. This has its con if we have a hole greater than 20,000 values somewhere in the table, it will stop indexing assuming it reached the end, but thats a tradeoff we have to live for now. p  pCan anyone suggest a more efficient way of getting data from a table to index I would assume we are not the first ones facing this problem  search engines are widely used nowadays p

Negative 2944 pHere is the scenario. I have a WCF service, when this service is called it passes control to an instance of another class created via Ninject. In that class I need to do some work, specifically with Entity Framework and repositories. To cut a long story short, I have the following binding declared.p  precodeBindltIGenericProductRepositorygt     .ToltGenericProductRepositorygt     .WithConstructorArgument context, new StagingDataContext codepre  pWhen I want to use this repository I have the following.p  precodeusing var genericProductRepository  IoC.ResolveltIGenericProductRepositorygt codepre  pThe problem is, that I only get a new instance of genericProductRepository if its a brand new request, if the method is called multiple times in the same request I get an error stating that the context the EF context is already disposed, this is because it seems like I am getting the same instance back that was already disposed in the using statement. To explain it another way, using the Microsoft WCF Test Client, if I invoke it the first time, the code runs fine, if I push the invoke button again without restarting the test client, i.e. the same request then it throws this error about it being disposed already.p  pI have tried to play around with the various scopes that come with Ninject, but clearly I am missing something.p  pSo my basic question is, how do I get a new repository whenever it hits that line, instead of using the same one  Help would be greatly appreciated, Im really trying to push for my company to adopt Ninject and drop Spring.p

In portrait it works perfectly and passes the focus through all four EditTexts with no hitch. If I put the NextFocusDown into the landscape, it will fail to compile, stating No resource found that matches the given name at nextFocusDown with value idphone.p  pA solution or explanation would be great. The idea is that I have four text boxes in two different LinearLayouts and whichever one has focus first will pass it to the EditText beneath it, skipping the others. I want it to work as I have it in portrait layout, when the user hits next on the name, focus moves to phone, when they hit next on that it moves to email, etc. Im also curious as to why it is letting this work in portrait but not landscape.p

Negative 2944 pOkay, so my first question was is it important to order your css tags, which i discovered via this site that the answer is yes.br What I failed to discover in these response was HOW to order them. For my my case is a little different then where this was vaguely answered elsewhere from my research anyways.p  pI am using php codeincludeoncecode tags to insert my header, footer, and body. The purpose of this is to condense the file sizes optimization and to organize and separate the code so a noob such as myself doesnt get confused also it allows me to use theses aspects throughout the site on different pages and just have to change that one file to change things site wide for example, if i were to change the logo, it would change site wide. So essential my index looks like this so farp  precodediv php include of header div div php include of body div div php include of footer div codepre  pnow I know this is going to need to be fine tuned so the header, body and footer dont cluster up, but I think that I have it all covered.p  pWhat my issue is is that Ive styled the divs in this page at least the body div and the divs in the body include file, which is essentially a two column div page with divs inside the two containers for the content.br How do I begin to know how to style this. Also when ever I put the css into a style sheet, half the styles are there, the other half arent, am I supposed to put a link to the style sheet in every included file And if so how do I do this while still being able to validate, for example I cant put a head tag in the includes, because then there would be four head tags in the index  I know this is more than one question but it all ties together into one mess of a problem, so if you could clarify that would be awesome.

Negative 2944 pIm trying to implement a behavioral analysis for targeted marketing on my ecommerce website. The basic idea is as follows I assume the usage of MongoDB, but looking forward for the other recommendationsp  ul lievery website codeCategorycode has a list of associated codetagscode to it,li lievery content codeArticlecode also has a list of codetagscode,li lievery codeUsercode has an unique cookie ID assigned to himher on the first visit,li lipevery time the user browses a codeCategorycode or reads an codeArticlecode, we plan to increment the codeUsertagcode dictionary like thisp  precodedb.tagviews.update     id userid,     inc tags.foo 1, tags.bar 1, tags.baz 1,     true  upsert   codepreli ul  pSo if we want to see the interests of the particular user, we can fetch the codetagviewscode document for him and look through the codetagscode to see which ones has the most views.p  pHowever, Ive stumbled on a pretty much trivial thing  how to fetch users, based on tags criteria. E.g. weve got Google Galaxy Nexus in stock for an attractive price, and want to send marketing emails to the users most interested in code[android, phones, gadgets, google]code. p  pAs far as I understand, we have to create indexes on every codetags.code field in the tagviews collection, which is, of course, unacceptable. The other possible solution is to duplicate data in another dimension incrementing taguser combo instead of usertag. But syntetic tests looks very unpromising in terms of disk space and flexibility.p  pWhat would be your suggestions to effectively fetch the most interested users based on tags criteriap  pThanksp

Negative 2944 pSorry if the question was not clear. In my app I have 3 tabs on acion bar, further each of the tab has a separate xml layout with two fragments. For first two tabs the layout is similar, but the third tab has a separate xml layout.In first tab, I make rest calls and get the data to be displayed. The left side fragment displays folder list and right side fragment displays the file list. Tab2 is same but it displays the data from SD card. Its basically a file manager. p  pThe third tab is search page which is totally different from the first two fragments.p  pBelow is my question.p  ol liI want to know if I can use different activity for each of the tabs , is this the right design li liSince I am using the main activty to create the layouts required for the fragments, I now have a problem with the third tab, reason being the xml layout and the fragments classes code are completely changed for the third tab. here are the contents of the xml file.li ol  playout for first two tabsp  precodeltLinearLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid     androidorientationhorizontal     androidlayoutwidthmatchparent     androidlayoutheightmatchparent     androidididfrags1gt    ltfragment classTitlesFragment              androidididbrowsetitle             androidvisibilitygone             androidlayoutmarginTopandroidattractionBarSize             androidlayoutheightmatchparent androidlayoutwidth320dipgt      ltfragment classContentFragment              androidididbrowsecontent               androidvisibilitygone             androidlayoutmarginTopandroidattractionBarSize             androidlayoutheightmatchparent androidlayoutwidthmatchparentgt     ltfragmentgt     ltLinearLayoutgt  Layout for the third tab  ltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt ltLinearLayout  xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid  androidididsettings   androidbackgrounddrawablewindow  androidorientationhorizontal   androidlayoutwidthmatchparent   androidlayoutheightwrapcontent   androidbaselineAlignedtruegt      ltfragment classSearchFragment                               androidididsearchtitle             androidvisibilitygone             androidlayoutmarginTopandroidattractionBarSize             androidlayoutweight1             androidlayoutheightmatchparent              androidlayoutwidth700dp             androidpaddingRight5dipgt      ltfragment classSearchContentFragment             androidididsearchbrowsecontent              androidvisibilitygone             androidlayoutmarginTopandroidattractionBarSize             androidlayoutweight1                   androidlayoutwidthmatchparent                 androidlayoutheightmatchparentgt      ltLinearLayoutgt codepre  pSo when I click from first tab to tab3 search the UI is renedered properly, but I can not come back from tab3 to tab1. To fix this I moved the fragments from the xml files and doing it in the main activity code.

The next question, I earlied said that I get the data from server using rest calls to update tab1 fragments, since I am using the list fragments for tab1 and tab2 , I just do setListAdapter, but with this I am trying to understand if I can implement a backstack or I need a new fragment transaction with every list item click and then add the fragment to the backstack.p  pLet me know, if my question still sounds unclear. p  pThanks, Harshap

Negative 2944 pI do know the syntactical difference between overriding and overloading. And I also know that overriding is runtime polymorphism and overloading is compiletime polymorphism. But my question is Is overloading is really compiletime polymorphism Is the method call really solving at compile time. To clarify my point, lets consider an example class.p  precodepublic class Greeter      public void greetMe          System.out.printlnHello           public void greetMeString name          System.out.printlnHello   name           public void wishLuck          System.out.printlnGood Luck       codepre  pSince all of the methods codegreetMe, greetMeString name, wishLuckcode are public, they all can be overridenincluding overloaded one, right For example,p  precodepublic class FancyGreeter extends Greeter      public void greetMe          System.out.println         System.out.println  Hello           System.out.println       codepre  pNow, consider the following snippetp  precodeGreeter greeter  GreeterFactory.getRandomGreeter greeter.greetMe codepre  pThe codegetRandomGreetercode method returns a random codeGreetercode object. It may either return an object of codeGreetercode, or any of its subclasses, like codeFancyGreetercode or codeGraphicalGreetercode or any other one. The codegetRandomGreetercode will create the objects either using codenewcode or dynamically load the class file and create object using reflectionI think it is possible with reflection or any other way that is possible. All of these methods of codeGreetercode may or may not be overriden in subclasses. So the compiler has no way to know whether a particular methodoverloaded or not is overriden. Right Also, wikipedia says on a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiVirtualfunctionJava relnofollowVirtual functionsap  blockquote   pIn Java, all nonstatic methods are by default virtual functions.        Only methods marked with the keyword final, which cannot be overridden,        along with private methods, which are not inherited, are nonvirtual.p blockquote  pSince, virtual functions are resolved at runtime using dynamic method dispatch, and since all non private, non final methods are virtualwhether overloaded or not, they must be resolved at runtime. Rightp  pThen, How can overloading still be resolved at compiletime Or, is there anything that I misunderstood, or am I missingp

Negative 2944 pWhen debugging with GDB during one debug session it becomes slower and slower over time. Even simplest operations like step over and step into can take dozens of seconds and sometimes even minutes.p  pI was debugging a rather big project Chromium browser. The only reason I could think of was that gdb is getting slower over time because it loads more and more symbols and it takes longer to work with them. However Chromium compiles entire code into one huge executable, which contains all symbols which should be loaded in the very beginning. Thus symbol database wont grow during the debugging. Moreover why would one need to look up symbols just to perform step over or step into operationp  pWhile testing I have tried using gdb with frontends Eclipse, QtCreator, Emacs and from the command line to confirm that this is not an IDE problem. Both use cases demonstrate same problem, however it seems like it starts to appear sooner in IDEs probably because IDE also loads symbols for the watch view, call stack, list of threads etc..p  pWhy is GDB getting slower Is it a design flaw, a bug or some specific problem in my computer Are there any free alternatives to GDB that work fasterp

And the error I get in the debugger TotalView is that an allocation call failed or the address returned is null.p  pThe crash does not always happen in the same place in the code each time I run it, but does always happen during an allocation call to create a node in an STL list. I dont think Im running out of memory. I have a few memory leaks, but theyre very small. What else can cause a memory allocation error And why does it happen on the Unix machine and not on my PC p  pUPDATE I used MemoryScape to help debug. When I used guard blocks, the program ran through without crashing, further suggesting a memory issue. What finally worked to nail down the problem was to paint allocated memory. It turns out I was initializing a variable, but not setting it to a value before I used it as an array index. The array was therefore overrunning because it was using whatever garbage was in the variables memory location  often it was 0 or some other small number, so no problem. But when I ran the program long enough, it was more likely to hold a larger number and corrupt the heap when I wrote out of bounds of the array. Painting the allocated memory with a large number forced a segfault right at the line of code where I attempted to write a value in the array and I could see that large painted number being used as the array index.p

Negative 2944 pI am writing an Android service that checks a website every day at 5 PM. If certain conditions are met it will raise a Notification, if not then nothing should happen.p  pAt first I tried to implement it as a background service that would start a thread that sleeps for the number of milliseconds until the next 5 PM, then do the check and raise the notification if needed, and then go back to sleep again. This worked if I was close to 5 PM when the service was started, but not otherwise and I have learnt after googling that Android can kill a service at any time, so I guess this is not the recommended solution.p  pThe recommendations I find seems to all point to the AlarmManager, which was also what I first looked at before implementing the above solution, but there is one drawback with it. If I use RTC as type, then the check wont be performed until the user starts to use the phone, I want it to be done even if idle. However, I dont want to use RTCWAKEUP because I dont want the screen to turn on unless I conclude that the notification should be raised.p  pI guess it should be doable as it is exactly what any emailapplication does. The screen doesnt come on every minute if that is how often the email service checks the server for new messages.p  pDoes RTCWAKEUP really turn on the screen If yes, is there another preferred technique for implementing the above scenariop

Negative 2944 pemFYI  I have edited this significantly since my first edition.  This simulation has been reduced from taking 14 hours to 14 minutes.emp  pI am new to programming but I have made a simulation that tries to follow asexual replication in an organism and quantify the differences in chromosome number between the parent and daughter organisms.  The simulation runs extremely slow.  It takes about 6 hours to complete.  I wanted to know what would be the best way to make the simulation run faster.p  pThese digital organisms have x number of chromosomes.  Unlike most organisms the chromosomes are all independent of each other so they have equal chance of being transfered into either daughter organism.p  pIn this case, the distribution of chromosomes into a daughter cell follows a binomial distribution with probability of 0.5.p  pThe function codesimrepocode takes a matrix of digital organisms with a known number of chromosomes and puts them through 12 generations of replication.  It duplicates these chromosomes and then uses the coderbinomcode function to randomly generate a number.  This number is then assigned to a daughter cell.  As no chromosomes are lost during asexual reproduction the other daughter cell receives the remaining chromosomes.  This is then repeated for emGem number of generations.  Then a single value is sampled from each row in the matrix.p  precode simrepo  function x1, G12, k1, t25, h1000                 x1 is the list of copy numbers for a somatic chromosome              G is the number of generations, default is 12              k is the transfer size, default is 1              t is the number of transfers, default is 25              h is the number of times to replicate, default is 1000              dup lt x1  2  duplicate the initial somatic chromosome copy number for replication             pop lt 1  set generation time             set.seed11             z lt matrixrbinomnrep1,lengthdup,size  as.vectordup,prob  0.5,nrow  nrowdup  amount of somatic chromosome is distributed to one of the daughter cells             z1 lt dup  z  as no somatic chromosomes are lost, the other daughter cells receives the remainder somatic chromosomes             x1 lt cbindz, z1  put both in a matrix              for  pop in 1G    this loop does the replication for each cell in each generation                 pop lt 1  pop  number of generations.

The following function represents transferring a cell into a new living environment.  It takes the output from the function codesimrecodep and uses that to generate more generations.  It then finds the variance among the rows in the first and last matrix columns and finds the difference between them.p  precode     The following function is mostly the same as I talked about in the description.      The only difference is I changed some aspects to take into account I am using      matrices and not lists.

Negative 2944 pI know that Mercurial doesnt support symbolic links in repos on Windows I can live with that, though an implementation using NTFS symlinks would be nice for those who can enable the privilege on their Windows boxes for nonadmins.p  pWhat Im wondering is about the way that Mercurial treats actual links from a Unix repository when the repo is seen on a Windows machine. If I update from a repo with a symlink in on my Windows development machine, I see that the link is changed into an actual file with the target of the link in it as text.p  pemSomehowem, Mercurial knows even on Windows that the file was originally a symlink, even when it is stored as a real file. If I edit the contents of the file in Windows, I can change the target of the symlink, because its still recorded as being a symlink by Mercurial  when I push back to Unix, the symlink is pointing to the new location.p  pSo. How do I mark a file that Ive created in Windows as a symlink Its clear that Mercurial could push such a symlink into the Unix filesystem, but I dont know how to mark it as such without creating the link first under Unix.p  pIs there a flag that can be setp

Negative 2944 pLet me set up the situation first.p  pI have a users table with X fields, the fields dont really matter for my question except for visibility.

If the visibility flag is 1 however, I need to make sure the user id and the requester are friends in the friends table and only return that user if they are friends. p  pI thought about using PHP to filter the visibility after I get my results back but the pagination limit will be screwed up if I ask for 5 records for example and one or more user has visibility set to 1 and are not friends with the requester. This pretty much has to be done entirely thru sql. p  pPossiblep

Negative 2944 pIm trying to use PHP with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 and it makes me want to die. I have a stored procedure that works perfectly via FreeTDS that I run in the terminal on my Mac, works perfectly in Visual Studio, and works perfectly via ASP.NET on a FrontPage server. It fails miserably through PHP 5.3.2 on an Ubuntu web server, however. In the procedure, I set up a few temp tables and insert into them from a giant table, which invariably contains some nulls here and there. The error I get isp  precodeCannot insert the value NULL into column Notes, table tempdb.dbo.termtable100000000BE0B column does not allow nulls. INSERT fails. codepre  ponly with a billion more underscores. Someone posted this as a bug a hrefhttpsbugs.php.netbug.phpid44049 relnofollowherea, but it hasnt got much attention. My best attempt was specifying a NULL constraint on every column of every temp table, but it didnt help. Also tried codeSET ANSINULLS ONcode. I dont have much access to any of these servers as far as patches and drivers go, nor do I have a heck of a lot of access to the people who do. I dont think theyre going to want to do much to help me out, but if someone has a really good idea, Ill try to get it done. Oh, and, it should be noted that the same procedure in SquirrelSQL via Microsoft JDBC driver gives bizarre, halfcorrect results.

Negative 2944 pWhat is a common approach to inorder multithreaded message processingbrbr Consider the following example I have a publisher that sends numbers into a queue code1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7codebrbr My goal is to process odds and evens sequentially.brbr One possible solutions I know is to have a separate queue per thread and split original based on coden  mcode criteria.brbr What Im worried about is the fact that numbers may be distributed unevenly and I will end up with some threads to have less work to do.brbr I have been thinking of implementing custom queue that will check if queue element with same criteria is being processed by some other thread and if it does, try to find another one. That might work, I have tried to implement something, but it gets complicated and is harder to test. That is why I first try to find existing solutions to the problem.p

Negative 2944 pI am doing my first ASP.NET MVC project.  In fact, for the record, this is my first production website of any kind.p  pThis is a mobile web page targeting HTML 5.p  pThis page looks up some expensive information.  First it uses the html 5 geocoding feature to get the customers latlong from their browser.  p  pI pass that information to a controller.  That controller fills in the City and State into a location model using the Google Maps API and then uses it in the view.  p  pSo this data is expensive in two ways, first it takes time to look it up and second, in the case of the Google API, it is literally not free in that Google limits the number of calls that can be made per day.p  pI understand that MVC is designed to embrace the web including the fact that http is a stateless protocol.    p  pNevertheless, I would like to avoid having to fetch this expensive data on every page load for every endpoint that needs it.  Furthermore, one other piece of state that I would like to keep track is the fact that the data has already been fetched.p  pWhat is the best way  best practice for achieving this on an MVC 3 web application  Since my model for location has 4 data point lat long city state and there is a fifth data point data retrieved I would really like to avoid using querystrings to do this or a route for all of those data pointsp  pI am sure this is a common need but I honestly dont know how to tackle it.  Any help will be appreciated.p  pSethp

Negative 2944 pIm trying to use jQuery to set the height of several divs to all be the same height as the tallest div. Basically I loop through the divs and get the height from each of them, storing the largest one in a variable. Then I loop through all of them again and set their height to the variable.p  pHowever, jQuery is giving me the wrong value for the height. For example, the height function for the first div returns 633, but when I look at it in the inspector it says that it is 603. I have absolutely no idea why its doing this. It seems to be including the padding and margins, but the documentation says it shouldnt be doing that.p  pThe height for the divs is set as auto in my stylesheet. If I give them a fixed pixel height then the jQuery height function returns the correct value, but not when they are on auto as they need to be.p  pThe site in question is ictsf.org. Notice the extra space at the bottom of the three columns.p

Negative 2944 pI like the functionality of IsMouseDirectlyOverChanged, but it only works for the topmost elements.  What I really want to do is monitor the IsMouseOver property of a control, regardless of its zindex, and receive notification when IsMouseOver is modified.  If I owned this property, I could do INotifyPropertyChanged, but unfortunately its owned by UIElement.  Still learning the ropes of WPF, so maybe this is easy, but Im not familiar with how to monitor properties that belong to parent classes.  Unlike IsMouseDirectlyOver, IsMouseOver doesnt have a changed event attached.p

Negative 2944 pI want to calculate the smallest integer with exactly codekcode bits set, that is greater than another integer codexcode.p  pFor example if codex  1001010code then for codek2code, the answer should be code1010000code for codek4code, the answer should be code1001011code and for codek5code the answer is code1001111code p  pI think that one would need to set at least as many bits as the leftmost bits set in the integer codexcode, and then choose between setting the MSBside bit adjacent to the next leftmost set bit in codexcode, or setting the next leftmost set bit and then look at setting the bits following that by repeating the same process all the while counting the bits left out of the k.p  pI am not sure if this is the correct approach.p

So my question is how do I implement the event handler code above in XAML, I cant find any way of executing a Method within the view when a datacontext property changes. I have looked into DataTriggers but they dont contain the ability to execute the methods. Also the DataTrigger would need to fire when the property changes, not when it is set to a specific value.p  pI do not wish to push the updates through the ViewModel because this is STICTLY a View thing it has nothing to do with the viewmodel itself. eg. A different implementation of the View may not need to update in these circumstances. Even if I was to pus it through the ViewModel, the view itself would still have the same issue of how to execute the methods.p  pThankyou for your help.p

Negative 2944 pA while back, I noticed that VLC has the ability to play videos directly on the desktop. When I did so at my school, on Windows XP, it played underneath the icons. When I tried at home, on Windows 7, it hid the icons. Im not sure if its the operating system or if its an update of VLC, but Im interested in playing it underneath the icons.p  pAfter noticing this, I had an idea to make an animated desktop of sorts. Nothing special, just a few select videos for my own use. The idea I started with was to play a video in my own window using codemciSendStringcode and do a codePrintWindowcode of each frame, save it to a file, and set the desktop wallpaper as the file. Ive since lost the specific code, but it wasnt quite working, and, needless to say, would perform horribly. p  pComing back to it, I realized there must be a much more efficient way than that anyway, but I cant quite grasp what that is. p  pI tried all in Windows 7 now setting the videos parent window to codeGetDesktopWindowcode, to the effect of minimizing all windows leaving behind a new window on the taskbar playing the video, but being able to see the desktop through clicking the aero peek button or hitting WinD.p  pI then tried the same with a parent window of the desktops folder view window. The result was the same dimensioned window playing the video, but this time, the desktop could not be accessed, and no new window was created. Its like it was playing over top of most of the desktop, but the gadgets go over top and the areas toward the right and bottom still show due to the smaller playing window size. p  pWhat does VLC do to play it on the desktop itself, looking as if its a dynamic wallpaper Is it significantly harder to make it play underneath the icons and gadgets if you add in Windows 7, I suppose The program itself will be used on Windows XP. Im not sure if DirectShow has anything that might help, but Im willing to use it, among other Windows API areas besides just MCI. Id prefer the solution to be in C, if it makes a difference. .NET would also work well, but might take a bit of extra time working in.p

Negative 2944 pTheres a method with several parameters that returns a String. In many conditions the method throws an exception. When it does return, the contents of the String are dependent on both the parameters and on the configuration of a certain USB dongle plugged into the computer. The length of the returned String is entirely dependent on the parameters though.p  pWhat Im wondering is how to unit test this using Mockito which Im new to. One of the test methods should complete successfully when the returned String is of a certain length.p  pLet me know if you need more info.p

Negative 2944 pI have built a report in Report Builder, but it is works only for certain values, i.e a parameter I pass in. I think I know why it is happening, but Im not sure how to sort it out. 4 of the columns being returned are named dynamically, depending on what the parameter I pass in is.  p  pIf I run the report for a different parameter, I get 4 different column names and they are not mapped to the column names the Report Builder uses.  It seems that Report Builder is only mapping the columns I used when I first tested the query.p  pIs there a way to specify that certain columns may have different names, and tell Report Builder to expect itp

Negative 2944 pI have a tab bar with 4 buttons Home, Visits, Share, More.

However, if I also wanted to offer a thumbnail view of my data or a dekstoplike view of my data, what would be the best way to accomplish thisp  pIve read a little bit on Javascript frameworks like Backbone, Angular, Ember, and Knockout, but is this even the right approach  If it helps to understand my issue my data is a bunch of files and their metadata.  Id love to have those three views of them, but I dont want to have my Javascript just be a ton of searching through DOM nodes, Id rather have some data consistency and have the DOM render data according to what view I choose.p

Negative 2944 pI have a php project that uses mysqli to query a database. Some of the columns in this database can be null. I have code that looks something like thisp  precodequery  ... result  DBgtqueryquery row  resultgtfetchassoc column  row[mycolumn] codepre  pIf codemycolumncode is null, the value of codecolumncode appears to be the string, codeNULLcode NOT the null value, but actually the string containing the word NULL. So what happens if I have columns which actually have the string codeNULLcode in them How can I differentiatep  pThanks Joshp  pEDIT Upon closer inspection, it appears that the string is actually a 5characters string. The first 4 characters are codeNULLcode, but the last character is 0x0d, the carriage return. This makes it a lot easier to detect, although Im still curious if theres a less hacky way than just doing string comparison.p

The first machine then receives that result and updates its GUI accordingly. The code I have below is doing this, but I the problem is that the GUI is not being updated until after the other machine sends their next shot. Im guessing this is because Im calling coderecieveShotcode from within the codesendShotcode method, but Im not 100 clear on why, since the method for updating the GUI codegp.ob.updateBoardsrcode is called before codereceiveShotcode. What am I misunderstanding here p  pFurther, I have a feeling that my basic programflow method here is flawed, and that codereceiveShotcode should not be called from the codesendShotcode method. Are there any obvious alternatives to this schemep  precodevoid sendShotShotAttempt sa      try         oos.writeObjectsa        oos.flush        System.out.printlnshot fired        ShotResult sr  ShotResultois.readObject        gp.ob.updateBoardsr       catch IOException  ClassNotFoundException e          System.out.printlne.printStackTrace       receiveShot   void receiveShot     try     ShotAttempt sa  ShotAttemptois.readObject     ShotResult sr  gp.db.acceptShotsa     oos.writeObjectsr     oos.flush      catch IOException  ClassNotFoundException ee.printStackTrace  codepre

Negative 2944 pThis is hard to explain ...

Negative 2944 pIm in a situation that I have a lot of of XMLs, that are sent to me from a server and Im using JAXB or any API based on that architecture for building instances of objects. p  pThe problem is, I have to perdetermine the class that I want to unmarshall for at compile time. My solution that is in my mind, is to read the incoming XML object and based on some tags, I will direct the unmrashaller to make an instance of the specified class. That approach will let me have a lot of IFs statements and big state machine. p  pIs there a better design pattern or approach p

Negative 2944 pstrongMy Problemstrong I have a UITableView section that is used to create a list. Each TableViewCell has  UITextField in it. When you begin typing the textfield, a new cell is inserted. All of this functionality works perfectly. However, if the user creates many cells, they go off screen and problems occur. Specifically that the cells on top of the section start to get reused. This results in unwanted text in new cells, and the deletion of text in old ones.

Negative 2944 pWhile compiling under linux I use flag j16 as i have 16 cores. I am just wondering if it makes any sense to use sth like j32. Actually this is a quesiton about scheduling of processor time and if it is possible to put more pressure on particular process than any other this way let say i have like to pararell compilations each with j16 and what if one would be j32. I think it does not make much sense but I am not sure as do not know how kernel solves such things.p  pKind regards,p

When receiving response from Twitter, I post info back to server. This way the post is synchronous, but the browser side has to post twice once to Twitter and once to server.li liWhen client side need to send a tweet. It post the request to server, the server push this request to a task queue and return asynchronously.

Negative 2944 pIve linked the code here..I just dont feel like I understand the search algorithms. I havent really tried to attempt them, but I know that I dont have to do a thing else. I feel as though this is too simple for me to understand.p  pWhen I read on BreadthFirst Search, I do understand that I have to search the rows before I move down a level on the tree and same for depth first moving down, but how would that be coded Im just stumped.p  pBasically, this is an 8Puzzle using GlutOPENGL, where the computer does the search for you, and is supposed to output the moves to said user. The blank will ALWAYS start in the middle. I save the order in an array, and then need to output the moves.

Negative 2944 pIm trying to calculate totals in an orders model in Rails and having a little bit of trouble. The discussion a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4423739cantunderstandhowtosumitemspriceinrorherea helps, but doesnt quite apply to my case.p  pBasically, a user can chose products which are added to their order, then saved as orderproducts. I have the following models only relevant fields are mentionedp  precodeproducts table has fields name, price class Product  end   orders table has field total class Order   hasmany orderproducts   acceptsnestedattributesfor orderproducts end  orderproducts table has fields orderid, productid, qty class OrderProduct   belongsto order   belongsto product end codepre  pWhat is the best way to sum items to create an order total Obviously you cant just pass in a hidden field on the order form right, as someone could manipulate that. I was thinking about doing something like thisp  precodeclass Order   hasmany orderproducts   acceptsnestedattributesfor orderproducts   beforesave calctotal    def calctotal     self.total  orderproducts.product.sumampprice     or should this be orderproducts.sumampproduct.price or similar   end  end codepre  pBut that doesnt look like the right syntax. Maybe I cant use the sum function, and should just loop through the orderproducts and look up the price from the Product model Surely this is a pretty common scenario  am I going about it the right wayp  pAlso, given that product prices may change, is it best to also store the price of each product in the order products table, at the time of the order In this case would I just add another beforesave function in the OrderProduct model, looking up the current price from the Product model, multiply it by the qty and saving as a producttotal value p  pAnd lastly, what happens if a product is deleted, when there are orderproducts that reference it Will this cause issues Or am I ok if I cache the necessary product data in the orderproducts table at the time of order.p  pThanksp

Negative 2944 pI am using the Facebook Graph API to request a list of Facebook profiles and return them in a ListView displaying both names and profile pictures.  I have two EditText fields in my main acitivty to enter both first and second names.  A button starts my ListViewActivity when clicked and the names are passed.  The ListView inflates and the request is sent to Facebook and each row in the ListView is updated using a custom adapter.  p  pThe problem is, I suspect, a memory leak.

Negative 2944 pI tried searching for my problem, but couldnt find a solution. Sorry if this is already posted.p  pI have a dynamically created href link using append, but it does not work on mobile Safari and mobile Chrome other than ipad. The link works fine on all desktop browsers I have tested or if I choose Request desktop site on a mobile device.

Negative 2944 pMost of the Html helpers available in ASP.Net MVC have overloads with codeobject htmlAttributescode. This is used to provide additional attribute values for the outputted tags.

Negative 2944 pIm trying to port some code from C to assembly but Im running into some trouble here. In the c function I get passed a struct.

Negative 2944 pI have to measure how many code lines in a project and a release made between two labels. I can do that and theres no problem with that for me. p  pMy question is about the weight I have to attach to the files which consist the project. I have to weigh the files in a relative way so we finally get a weighted mark. For instance If I have CPP project, I believe i have to give a different weight to cpp file h files and text files since the time invested in each file type is quite different.p  pFurthermore, I may consider to provide a different mark for added lines, removed and changed lines, since sometimes it takes more time to change an existing line rather than add a new one. However Im not sure yet about that.p  pDo you know where can I find good reading material about that My question is quite generic  Id like to read also about Java, C and any code language.p  pThank youp

Negative 2944 pIm facing a strange situation. For a website some cronjobs are being executed. This all worked well until now when I try to excecute a cronjob Im getting no result. For some reason the URL is recognized by .htaccess trying to put it into the site with wrong GET parameters. The second parameter is 500.

Negative 2944 pThis is one of those situations where if I knew the name of what I was trying to do, Id probably be able to research it.p  pEssentially, I have a set of 2D points vertices that are sparse in some areas, and concentrated in others.

I will also need to fetch the default Y value for one X.p  h3Option 1h3  pShould I set boolean column on table Y with isDefault and constraint that enforce that there is only one default for one relation to X fktoX and isDefaultp  h3Option 2h3  pShould I make a foreignkey on table X to table Y FKDefaultYID that would contain the ID of the default Y rowp  h3Example 1h3  pX has many Y. I need to found the default value in the Y values by using either option 1 or option 2.p  h3Example 2h3  pIts just like a preference value. I have a select box with many choices. I need to set a default choice when the select box is loaded. So I fetch every Y for X. When the form is saved, I fetch the default Y row for that X and save that value.p

Negative 2944 pCan anyone think of a good way to sync a mysql database with another mysql database before the server starts up I thought maybe i could rsync the directories in rc.d, but that seems dicey.   The servers running on FreeBSD.p  pThanks.p  pFor clarificationp  pAlright.  I am setting up mysql as a session store for a php web application.  I have written a class that overrides phps session methods with methods that offer benefits important to our web app.  In the interest of the maximum speed, the main mysql server is storing its data in a tmpfs partition.  It replicates to a server with an SSD.p  pIn the event of a failure, my session management class will automatically roll over to the slave, but when the master reboots, and the mysql service starts, session requests will be redirected at it, but there will be no data present.  Ergo, I need to get the data from the slave during the boot sequence of the master.p

Negative 2944 pId like to be able to draw the cross section of a lens element. Theyre generally made up of 1 or 2 circular surfaces front and back face and an arbitrarilyshaped rim. For my purposes, Id just want to draw one or two lines to connect the front and back face.p  pHeres an example of what Im talking aboutp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comSEu6J.png altenter image description herep  pEach element in this picture is made up of two [probably] circular arcs with between two and six straight lines to connect them. Im not worried about drawing aspheric lens elements quite yet.p  pMy initial idea is to draw arcs with the proper arc length, then draw the lines to connect them. My worry with that approach is that the arcs and lines may not match up and there could be either overlap or a gap due to precision errors.p  pIs there a better way to approach this problem Can I draw polygons that include both straight and curved edgesp

Negative 2944 pI have opened a micro instance on AWS with a WindowsServer2008R2SP1English64BitBase2013.11.13 ami1e53c82e virtual machine.  RDS is open and I have connected with remote desktop connection.  Additionally, at initialization I set HTTP port 80, and HTTPS port 443 although I do not know how to verify that now. From within the VM I navigated to XAMPP and installed a default installation minus MySQL.  I then navigated to XAMPP control panel V3.2.1 and started Apache.  I set a password on XAMPP directory.  I set a Hello World test txt file in htdoc and that loads in the VM browser. However, when I try to access the pubic IP, my local browser times out.  p  pI think I covered the first three checks on  xampp configuration in windows server 2008 r2 ec2 instance postp  pbut not sure how to change the elastic or private IP response if that is relevant.p

Negative 2944 pIve been troubleshooting this issue for about a week and I am nowhere, so I wanted to reach out for some help. p  pI have a perl script that I execute via command like, usually in a manner ofp  precode nohup .script.pl param arg param2 arg2 amp codepre  pI usually have about ten of these running at once to process the same type of data from different sources that is specified through parameters. The script works fine and I can see logs for everything in nohup.out and monitor status via ps output. This script also uses a sql database to track status of various tasks, so I can track finishes of certain sources. p  pHowever, that was too much work, so I wrote a wrapper script to execute the script automatically and that is where I am running into problems. I want something exactly the same as I have, but automatic. p  pThe getwork.pl script runs ps and parses output to find out how many other processes are running, if it is below the configured thresh it will query the database for the most out of date source and kick off the script. p  pThe problem is that the kicked off jobs arent running properly, sometimes they terminate without any error messages and sometimes they just hang and sit idle until I kill them. p  pThe getwork script queries sql and gets the entire execution command via sql concatanation, so in the sql query I am doing something like CONCATnohup .script.pl arg ,param1, arg2 ,param2, amp to get the command string. p  pIve tried everything to get these kicked off, Ive tried using system , but again, some jobs kick off, some dont, sometimes it gets stuck, sometimes jobs start and then die within a minute. If I take the exact command I used to start the job and run it in bash, it works fine. p  pIve tried to also open a pipe to the command likep  precodeopen my ca,  command or die  print ca command close ca codepre  pThat works just about as well as everything else Ive tried. The getwork script used to be executed through cron every 30 minutes, but I scrapped that because I needed another shell wrapper script, so now there is an infinite look in the get work script that executes a function every 30 minutes. p  pIve also tried many variations of the execution command, including redirecting output to different files, etc... nothing seems to be consistent. Any help would be much appreciated, because I am truly stuck here.... p  pEDIT  Also, Ive tried to add separate logging within each script, it would start a new log file with its PID . There was a bunch of weirdness there too, all log files would get created, but then some of the processes would be running and writing to the file, others would just have an empty text file and some would just have one or two log entries. Sometimes the process would still be running and just not doing anything, other times it would die with nothing in the log. Me, running the command in shell directly always works though. p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 2944 pI im currently in the making of a mobile application prototype, which need to created in html, css and js. I made a lowfidelity prototype with paper cards, but now i need to create it as a website.p  pI was thinking about setting in a picture of a smartphone iphoneandroid and then edit the content inside that screen to point out that it should be run on a smartphone. So if you emagine a i picture of a smartphone, and then inside the screen i wanne create some kind of box where all my content should go, but i am not quite sure what the best way to do that is. Should i use a canvas, a iframe or something different If there are any other inputs you are more than welcome to fire them at me. I created a video to see how a user, unknown to the project, would interact with my low fidelity prototype, and thats what i am building my html prototype from. The video can be found here if it is to any interest.p  pa hrefhttpswww.youtube.comwatchvTVXhEwGYYfg relnofollowhttpswww.youtube.comwatchvTVXhEwGYYfgap  pdont mind the text, it is in danish and just describes what the user is dooingp  pHope you can give me a hand to get startet. p  pRegards, Nissen, Michaelp
Negative 2944 pIm using jQuery validation and processing the form via ajax so I can avoid a page refresh. The problem I am running into is that I cant figure out where to place the ajax code in the validation function so that the form wont send data until its been validated.p  pFor example p  precodeticketpurchasing.validate  initialize the plugin     rules          firstname              required true         ,         lastname              required true         ,         phone            required true,           digits true,         ,         email            required true,           email true         ,         address            required true         ,         city            required true         ,         state            required true               ,     invalidHandler function event, validator        var errors  validator.numberOfInvalids       if errors          var message  All fields in red must be filled           div.errormessage span.htmlmessage           div.errormessage.show          else            div.errormessage.hide            ,     submitHandler function form   for demo        Do stuff here        formticketpurchasing.onsubmit,functione        Send the serialized data to mailer.php.       .ajax           urlticketpurchase.php,           datathis.serialize,           typePOST,           successfunctiondata             console.logdata              sponsorshiprequest.slideUp              ticketpurchasing.hide              .seatsform.fadeIn1000           ,           errorfunctiondata             ticketpurchasing .error.show.fadeOut5000 Show Error Message                         e.preventDefault  To Avoid Page Refresh and Fire the Event Click       .postmailer.php       Take our response, and replace whatever is in the form2       div with it.        form2.show    codepre  pAs you can see above I have both functions separated from each other, and because of this the form is submitting the data which emails the information even though its not been validated yet. I tried using form.submit as show in the validator documentation, and putting the ajax code in there, but it was a no go with errors I couldnt solve.p  pAdvice Im probably going at this all wrong haha.p  pEdit Just added html for the form a hrefhttpsgist.github.comadrianrodriguez26b6beee8bf5ba85a8ce relnofollowhttpsgist.github.comadrianrodriguez26b6beee8bf5ba85a8ceap  pTo be clear, the form works fine without the validation portion, meaning I can submit and collect the data without a page refresh without the use of the validation plugin.p

How can I remove this option straight away I tried something like the following, but it doesnt work.p  pstrongadminpanel.phpstrong only relevant stuffp  precodeltselect nameusers idusersgt         ltoption value disabled selectedgtSelect userltoptiongt         ltphp             sql  mysqlquerySELECT  FROM users WHERE id ltgt.SESSION[userid].ORDER BY username DESC or diemysqlerror                 userList  []                 whilerowmysqlfetchassocsql                     username  row[username]                     userID  row[id]                     userList . ltoption nameuserID value.userID.gt.username.ltoptiongt                              echo userList         gt     ltselectgtltbrgtltbrgtltdivgt     ltdiv iduserinfogt         lt generated user info tablegt     ltdivgt  ltscript typetextjavascriptgt  userinfo.onclick, deleteAccount, functione     data.command  deleteAccount     data.userID  users.val     .posttheURL, data, functionresult         Do what you want with the response.         deleteaccountsuccess.htmlresult          users option[valuedata.userID].remove     deleteaccountsuccess.show     deleteaccountsuccess.fadeOut5000  ltscriptgt codepre  pstrongprocessUser.phpstrong part of a switch statementp  precodeifissetPOST[command]     cmd  POST[command]     userID  POST[userID]   sqlmysqlquerySELECT  FROM users WHERE id.userID. userData  [] whilerow  mysqlfetchassocsql     userData[userid]  row[id]     userData[username]  row[username]     userData[name]  row[name]     userData[date]  row[date]     userData[email]  row[email]     userData[avatar]  row[avatar]     userData[about]  row[about]     userData[admin]  row[admin]   switchcmd  case deleteAccount         sql DELETE FROM users WHERE id .userID         resultmysqlquerysql         echo ltimg srcpicsok.png classadminupdatedokgt     break  codepre

Negative 2944 pI want to create a messaging system with mySQL. I have the following columns in an innodb tablep  ul liMSGID intli liUSERIDSENDER intli liUSERIDRECIEVER intli liTIMESTAMPSENT varchar2000li ul  pThere are 3 queries that will be used on this table p  precodeSelect      From      msgTable  Where     USERIDRECIEVER  [id of the user who the message was sent to].  codepre  pThe other will be to insert a row a new message and the last will be a DELETE once the row has been read. To stress test I used a billion rows since users can send multiple messages. p  pI have inserted a billion test rows which have a btree index on codeUSERIDRECIEVERcode and a Unique index on the primary key codeMSGIDcode. The reads are quite fast 1 second but the inserts are much too slow 10 minutes. This is running on a 6core Intel i7 with 16gb ram. If I remove the indexes the inserts are a little faster since there is just one index to rebuild now, but then the reads are terribly slow. With the nature of a messaging system both select and insert I believe will be called the same amount of times roughly. p  pIs there anything else I can do to increase the performance so that the inserts also happen in about 12 seconds I tried to use batch inserts which helped speeds, but due to the business logic of the application it is not practical.p

E.g. each zero is contained in wchart array[16][15] and after I print this setup and change lets say array[13][0]  A nothing happens, is it due to Static window type or is it because of me being noobish and using MoveWindow to repaint them XDp

Negative 2944 pall, p  pWe have an app that mostly is just being used by our internal employees and we have our own enterprise license instead of going through apple store.  We want the app be able to log driving GPS all the time, from 900am to 500pm, even when our app is not running, of course with users permission. p  pSo, when our app is running either in front or in background, it has no problem to collect GPS data. However, sometimes when the ipad goes to sleep and our app gets killed, is there anyway to ask the system to wake our app up and update the gps update if there is a significant gps change Or defer those updates to our app when our app starts And if it is possible, does it require us to go through app store instead of using enterprise licensewhich is what we heard beforep  pThanks.p

Negative 2944 pITextSharp throws an error when you attempt to create a PdfTable with 0 columns.p  pI have a requirement to take XHTML that is generated using an XSLT transformation and generate a PDF from it. Currently I am using ITextSharp to do so. The problem that I am having is the XHTML that is generated sometimes contains tables with 0 rows, so when ITextSharp attempts to parse them into a table it throws and error saying there are 0 columns in the table.p  pThe reason it says 0 columns is because ITextSharp sets the number of columns in the table to the maximum of the number of columns in each row, and since there are no rows the max number of columns in any given row is 0.p  pstrongHow do I go about catching these HTML table declarations with 0 rows and stop them from being parsed into PDF elementsstrongp  pIve found the piece of code that is causing the error is within the HtmlPipeline, so I could copy and paste the implementation into a class extending HtmlPipeline and overriding its methods and then do my logic to check for empty tables there, but that seems sloppy and inefficient.p  pstrongIs there a way to catch the empty table before it is parsedstrongp  pstrongSolutionstrongp  pThe Tag Processorp  precodepublic class EmptyTableTagProcessor  Table      public override IListltIElementgt EndIWorkerContext ctx, Tag tag, IListltIElementgt currentContent              if currentContent.Count gt 0                      return base.Endctx, tag, currentContent                   return new ListltIElementgt       codepre  pAnd using the Tag Processor...p  precode        CSS         var cssResolver  XMLWorkerHelper.GetInstance.GetDefaultCssResolvertrue          HTML         var fontProvider  new XMLWorkerFontProvider         var cssAppliers  new CssAppliersImplfontProvider          var tagProcessorFactory  Tags.GetHtmlTagProcessorFactory         tagProcessorFactory.AddProcessornew EmptyTableTagProcessor, new string[]  table           var htmlContext  new HtmlPipelineContextcssAppliers         htmlContext.SetTagFactorytagProcessorFactory          PIPELINE         var pipeline              new CssResolverPipelinecssResolver,             new HtmlPipelinehtmlContext,             new PdfWriterPipelinedocument, pdfWriter          XML WORKER         var xmlWorker  new XMLWorkerpipeline, true          using var stringReader  new StringReaderhtml                      xmlParser.ParsestringReader          codepre  pThis solution removes the empty table tags and still writes the PDF as a part of the pipeline.p

Negative 2944 pOK.  Im looking to do something that I hope is rather simple and I can chalk up the last few hours of Googling  searching as a learning experience.  I have a UISplitViewController iOS 7, iPad with UITableViewControllers as the Master and Detail View Controllers.  All of this works fine the Detail View Controllers load correctly on selection.p  pId like to display a static UITableViewController with n sections and a single row in each section. In each row Id like to have a single UILabel that displays multiple lines of static text and Id like the UITableViewCell  row to be correctlysized based on the orientation of the device, namely 10 points of padding on top and bottom using AutoLayout.p  pThis should be simple, but the answer eludes me.  If youre trying to picture this in your head, imagine that I want to have 5 Help sections separated visually or 12 sections of a EULA, both of which are in my requirements...p  pHeres what Ive tried  I tried to subclass UITableViewCell to somehow know its height.  This didnt seem feasible because the height is set in UITableViewDelegate.  Then I subclassed UITableViewController and attempted to create a virtual UILabel and size it via the heightForRowAtIndexPath overridep  precodeoverride func tableViewtableView UITableView, heightForRowAtIndexPath indexPath NSIndexPath gt CGFloat         let labelUILabel  UILabelframe CGRectMake0, 0, tableView.frame.width20, CGFloat.max         label.numberOfLines  0         label.lineBreakMode  NSLineBreakMode.ByWordWrapping         label.font  dataTextLabel.font         label.text  dataTextLabel.text          label.sizeToFit         return label.frame.height28  codepre  pBut, this is bad.  To make things seem right I had to put in some fudge factors.  Through experimentation I found that subtracting 20 points from the frame width and adding 28 points to the sized UILabels height gave me the best possible approximation.  However, this is far from good.  When theres more text, the spacing is obviously off.  Also, as a standin I did this to only include a single block of text that I attach herep  precodeIBOutlet var dataTextLabel UILabel codepre  pThere has to be a better way and I have to believe that this comes up all of the time.  Ive seem many examples on the Interwebs, but they seem to always be with dynamic tables and they have all of the text in their code.  Some of my text, namely some legaleze will be very lengthy and Id rather not have this carried around as Strings.p  pSo, how can I have static text in a static UITableView and have the text be correctly sized based on orientation  Thanks in advance.p

Negative 2944 pSo I have this assignment to implement my own malloc and free in C. The problem is one of the requirements for the codememoryfreevoid ptrcode function. It has to return 1 if the pointer is invalid, i.e. it hasnt been allocated by the codememoryallocunsigned int sizecode, or return 0 otherwise. I just cant figure out a way to do this, without it being absolutely time inefficient.p  pSo my memory structure is this I have a global pointer to the beginning of the array I get to act as a heap. Every block of memory has an codeintcode header to tell the size of it and whether its free or not.p  pThis is my memoryfreevoid ptr function right now, TYPE is codetypedef unsigned intcodep  precodeint memoryfreevoid ptr      void head  ptr     if head  NULL         return 1     head  sizeofTYPE     if TYPE head amp 1          return 1     TYPE head amp 0x1     return 0  codepre  pThe pointer codeptrcode points to the first byte of user block, which means that if I want to read the header, I have to go back 4 bytes. One solution to check the validity of the pointer is to go through the heap from the beginning and see if I get on the header in question, but thats not time efficient. Could anyone tell me a better wayp

Negative 2944 pI am building an Access Database application in MS Access 2007 which is essentially a tool for data collection which I will need to distribute to various sites to be filled out.  After the sites fill out all the necessary records, they will return the tool and I will need to merge all the data from the various sites into a single database for analysis.  I have 2 tables and 3 forms with a bunch of custom VBA code behind for data validation, cleaning and flow.  p  pI have a Summary form that shows all the records currently entered.  Users can then Add a record using a button on the Summary form which launches a data entry form lets call it Data Entry Form 1.  From Data Entry Form 1, there is another form that can be launched Data Entry Form 2 for entering child records about the record being filled out on Data Entry Form 1.  There is referential integrity enforced at the table level.p  pThe flow from the Summary Form to Data Entry Form 1 and Data Entry Form 2 is important for the integrity of the data.  I have dictated this flow explicitly in VBA and will instruct users to always begin at the Summary Form.  p  pAfter that lengthy background, my question.....p  pWhat are my different options, and the relative advantagesdisadvantages for the options for deploying this application to my various sites.  My basic requirements arep  ul liIdeally users would never see the tables in which the data is being stored in.li liThe Summary form would launch when opened and they could not open any other form directly.  li liClosing the Summary form would close the application.li liSince there is a bunch of VBA code dictating important functionality, if they did not accept the Security Warning, they would not be able to access any of the forms or use the toolli liI can easily script the extractionexport of the data from the two tables for each toolli ul  pI am vaguely aware of the following options  Distribute the full ACCDB file to the sites  Create and distribute an AACDE file to the sites  Use the Access Developer Extensions to package the application  create and EXE filep  pI have also read that if users do not have Access 2007 or later, that they can download the MS Access Runtime Services and be able to use my application without having to buyinstall a full version of MS Access.  Can someone confirm this Does this apply to all of the above ACCDB, ACCDE, EXE Is there any functionality that would not be available to them from a strictly data entry rolep  pThanksp

However, clang gives an error in the bowels of qhash.h about codeinvalid operands to binary expressioncode where trying to use codecode on instances of codeFoocode.

Negative 2944 pIve recently come across this seemingly nice a hrefhttpwww.passwordstore.org relnofollowpass managera This manager allows passwords encryption using your gpg key and saving passwords in a git repository. Im a bit new to git so this is also some fun for me. p  pOne thing I dont get is the elegant way to access the same git rep from multiple computers to use pass. GPG key is required to start using pass and to create the local rep. Next when I try fetching from the remote rep, I obviously get a conflict because the gpg key on PC 2 is not the one used on PC 1 that is in the rep. When you try solving a conflict by removing the key in your local rep on PC 2 hoping to fetch the original one from the remote rep  pass fails to work without the key. So how do I get pass both PC 1 and PC 2 share the same gpg key so pass could work smoothly p  pDo I try to make it do something it is not supposed to do Otherwise I dont see any advantages of using a remote git rep for passwords. p  pThanksp

Negative 2944 pI have a sticky menu at the top of my website with text links which highlight when you scroll down to the appropriate section. This works fine using an anchor target. However I also need these links to then deactivate as I scroll to the next section and the next link to highlight. To do this I have used an additional anchor as in Skrollr you cannot use more then anchor per element, so my only choice was to wrap the first element in a new element with a new anchor. Is this in fact possible Anyway this is just not working for me.

Negative 2944 pI have a table inside a div of fixed size.  If the table overflows the div I would like  scrollbars to appear.  I also want to clone the header of the table for when I scroll down, so that the header is persistent.  The problem I have is that I want the horizontal scrollbar to scroll both the cloned header and the original table and the vertical scrollbar to move only the original table.p  pI am able to clone the header using javascript, but I am unable to style the result in a way to achieve my desired results.  Below is one attempt at the HTMLCSS assuming that the cloned header is already in place.  I get a lot of extra scrollbars, which I understand is due to the CSS spec itself.

Negative 2944 pHey Im recently involved in a compiler developer, Ive encountered a problem with minus sign and negative number1. Suppose now I have 53, 53, how to write a grammar rule such that during the abstract syntax tree construction, yacc will produce a correct abstract syntax tree My grammar is like     code     expr            constant           id                 execexpr  code     code     execexpr          expr PLUS expr         expr MINUS expr         expr MUL expr         expr DIV expr  codep  pMy thought for now is to have a UMINUS symbol with highest order nonassociate to deal with the case. Somehow, our compiler has to split the expression into expr and execexpr, Ive tried with the method but it doesnt work for some reasons.p  pWhats the standard solution for dealing with this case in any other language Especially those with LR0 automaton. Thanks so muchp

Negative 2944 pCan we use HDFS Federation to separate different custom defined environments within a Hadoop cluster. Say I want to have a Testing environment and a Development environment. I have a cluster with 6 nodes. I dont want to create two clusters each pertaining to a respective environment. I want to rather use the same cluster but have each environment use its own resources with respect to HDFS and MapReduce operations. p  pThe environments needs to be isolated from each other with respect to the HDFS data blocks and what user access what directory. A MapReduce job should run in isolation as well. p  pIs this something possible with HDFS Federation. Im pessimistic about the MapReduce jobs running in isolation. Is this something people are doing when building different working environments within their Hadoop cluster or are they actually creating specific Hadoop clusters for specific working environments.p  pThanks in advance. p

Negative 2944 pWhat Im looking to do is bind some dynamic data to a jsTree i.e. a tree component from a hrefhttpwww.jstree.com relnofollowthis librarya tree using a JS framework. Im incidentally using a hrefhttpvuejs.org relnofollowvue.jsa but this problem is totally framework independent. At the moment it looks like jsTree only supports setting the tree data on initialization, i.e. when you call code.jstreecode, which is not what I want, as my data will change over time, and I want this to be reflected in the tree itself.p  pThe most obvious way, binding to HTML and then creating jsTree on these elements doesnt work because jsTree removes the original HTML from the DOM when it initializes p  precodeltdiv idjsTreegt     ltThis is all destroyed  gt     ltulgt         ltli vrepeatnodesgt value ltligt     ltulgt ltdivgt codepre  pHowever if you just play with the DOM and manually add nodes to the tree emafterem it has initialized, it looks fine. But you cant bind data to the DOM after the page has been compiled by the framework without difficulty.p  pSo how can jsTree be used with data bindingp

Negative 2944 pI have a situation Im hoping you can provide some insight into.

Without getting into the why we dont have a separate database instance, does anyone know how to contain the state  So for example imagine a database with a table Customer, that contains a column FirstName.p  pstrongBefore test runstrong FirstName contains the data Peter, Paul,br strongAfter test runstrong FirstName contains the data Peter, Paul, Jack, Amy strongBefore next test runstrong What is an effective way to bring the database state back to how it was before the last test run i.e. the data contained should be Peter, Paul again.p  pI have seen DBUnit but my understanding is that whilst you can initialize the state with your own data before a test run, it will also clear all data before a test run.  The problem is that I dont want to clear all data before a test run, but just that data that was introduced as part of the last test run.p  pI hope that was clear  Thanksp

Negative 2944 pSo Ive been building a program that uses Monte Carlo simulations to find properties of evolutionary graph theory. One of the key functions of this is to be able to generate uniformlydistributed random graphs, so that we can determine the generalised properties of graphs. For the case of connected undirected graphs I have implemented the solution outlined in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma14618505thisa answer. p  pHowever for directed graphs, generating the onedirectional uniform spanning tree you get from Wilsons algorithm doesnt ensure that the graph is stronglyconnected, and it seems that adding extra edges to make the spanning tree bidirectional would introduce a bias into the graphs that you generate. p  pI feel like I might be missing something obviousmisunderstanding something, but essentially my request is, can someone recommend to me a highlevel scheme that allows me to generate stronglyconnected, uniformlydistributed, random digraphsp
Negative 2944 pIs it possible for Androids a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidwidgetVideoView.html relnofollow titleVideoViewVideoViewa to read an MP4 file but skip the first 512 bytesp  pOur client does not want his videos to be easily transferredcopied on different devices. What we did was to obfuscate the MP4 file by adding random 512 bytes at the beginning of the file and then renaming the files with a different file extension.p  pObviously, the above approach does not perfectly protect his videos from being pirated. Hes fine with just enough protection for nontechies.p  pCurrently, upon playing the video, our Android app extracts the actual video content to a new temporary file by skipping the first 512 bytes. This temp file will be the one played by the VideoView.p  pThe problem is that this takes a long time especially that our videos are more than 100MB each. This is clearly not an acceptable solution.p  pI think, if we can just make the VideoView skip the first 512 bytes, were all set. Is it possible If not, what are the better alternativesp  pemDisclaimer Im the web developer of the server app that adds the 512byte padding. Im not an Android developer. Im posting this question on behalf of my Android dev colleague. Forgive me if our approach is totally noob. Feel free to suggest better and hopefully easy ways.emp

Negative 2944 pWe got multiple Application Server behind a Reverse Proxy. We want a single cache on another host which all Application Servers can easily use, thus the cache has to have some kind of network support. Furthermore the setup should be easy probably supporting docker, but this is not a must. The cache duration is about 1d. The API should be as easy and standardized as possible JCache. In a later stage we want to prepolutate the Cache.p  pWhich options do I havep  pBackground In a first step we want to reduce load on the backend systems, which provides mainly SOAP Services. So we want to cache the SOAP response JAXWS. The cache hit rate will be probably about 25 in a first stage. Later we want to use the same cache for JPA as well we already have in memory caching enabled for each Application Servcer and use a Cache Coordination strategy. To use even more caching we will need some sort cache categories.p

Is there a way to do it without me having to go in and wire everything together like thatp  pemEditem I used Modality.NONE so that no events will be blocked by the window, I dont know if this is relevant to the question however.p  pemEdit 2em I would like to have all the windows close upon exiting the main window it would be a bonus if I could intercept the close events and do cleanup too.p

And I know that this isnt a special case for recursion, because if I define codefib2code to be nearly identical to codefibcode, I can have them recurse via each other and it works fine.p  pstrongWhy do I not need to explicitly lend a borrowed, mutable variablestrongp
Negative 2944 pI have a node app that uses spawns to run ffmepg, move, copy, and remove files. The app runs great when I run it from the command line, but when I try to auto start it through a cron or upstart the processes dont seem to stick. Looking at the log the processes run all the way through. Theres child processes that are called in the callback of other child processes and they all seem to run, but when I look at the folder structure later not much has changed. The outputs for ffmepg are nowhere to be found. Which in my mind tells me that the processes didnt actually run, or maybe there was a permissions issue. The odd process is a spawn of a move command. I goto the folder where a file is supposed to be moved to, but it isnt there....the odd part being that its missing from the files origin.p  pI need this process to start on system boot, and again everything runs fine if i run it from the command line. Ive tried running it as a cron and through ubuntus upstart.

Negative 2944 pI have a solution which includes a database project for which we have a number of publish profiles. One of these is for the purposes of testing some functionality that requires an actual database to be in place so it is supposed to publish the database to codelocalDbcode, add any lookup data and then run some post deployment scripts to add some fake data.p  pThe test project has a pair of prebuild events to try and ensure that the DB project has been built and is then deployedp  precodeMSBuildBinPathmsbuild.exe SolutionDirCUIA DatabaseCUIA Database.sqlproj tRebuild  PROGRAMFILESMicrosoft Visual Studio 12.0Common7IDEExtensionsMicrosoftSQLDBDAC120sqlpackage.exe ActionPublish SourceFileSolutionDirCUIA DatabaseOutDirCUIAWorkspace.dacpac ProfileSolutionDirCUIA DatabaseUNITTEST.publish.xml VariablestestrunTrue pCreateNewDatabaseTrue codepre  pThe SQLCMD variable is what determines if the test data is inserted into the newly created database, and is defaulted to False.p  pThe problem is that it does not seem to work every time and I cannot find a reason why. If I start with nothing on the local db instance, then it works as expected, the DB is created and the tests have something to use. However, if I then change some of the test data using SSMS and rerun the tests, it seems to be a crapshoot as to whether or not the DB is recreated and mostly it is not. I can see this because my amended test data is still there so it has not been dropped. I have also verified the same behavious on a SQL Express instance. Database logs show no problems and the build outputs from successful runs are the same as for those where the DB is not recreated.p  pI havent been able to find much in the way of information on what I am trying to achieve so Im have to go with some hunches and guesswork so I appreciate that my prebuild event idea is possibly not the best solution. If anyone knows a better one then please speak up and share. However, the primary concern is why is the codepCreateNewDatabaseTruecode flag not being respected Surely this should demand that the database is dropped and recreated every single timep  h1EDITh1  pI know a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions22182349sqlpackageexeignoresitscreatenewdatabasepropertythis posta sounds similar but the OP was using the Script action, not Publish which is very different.p

Negative 2944 pI am using geopy to get latitude  longitude pairs for city names. For single queries, this works fine. What I try to do now is iterating through a big list of city names 46.000 and getting geocodes for each city. Afterwards, I run them through a check loop which sorts the city if it is in the US in the correct state. My problem is, that I get GeocoderTimedOutService timed out all the time, everything is pretty slow and Im not sure if that is my fault or just geopys nature. Here is the responsible code snippetp  precodefor tweetcount in rangenumberoftweets  Get the city name from the tweet city  datadict[0][tweetList][tweetcount][user][location]  Sort out useless tweets iflencitygt3 and notcity is None        THE RESPONSIBLE LINE, here the error occurs     location  geolocator.geocodecity       Here the sorting into the state takes place     if location is not None         for statecount in rangelendata             if pointinpolylocation.longitude, location.latitude, data[statecount][geometry]                  statetweets[statecount]  1                 break codepre  pSomehow, this one line throws timeouts at every 2.3. call. City has the form  of Manchester, New York, New York or something similar. I already had try  except blocks around everything, but that doesnt really change anything about the problem, so I removed them for now... Any ideas would be greatp
Negative 2944 pIm trying to model a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiConway27sGameofLife relnofollowConways game of lifea rules using integer linear programming, however Im stuck with one of the rules.p  pI consider a emfiniteem coden x ncode grid. Each cell in the grid is associated with a variable codeXi,jcode whose value is code0code if the cell is dead and code1code if it is alive.p  pIm particularly interested in emstill lifesem, i.e. configurations that, according to the rules, dont change from an instant to the next.p  pTo find them Im imposing the constraints on the number of neighbours for each cell. So, for an alive cell to remain still it must have code2code or code3code neighbours, and this is easily expressiblep  precode21Xi,j  i,j gt 2  51  Xi,j  i,j lt 3 codepre  pWhere codei, jcode is the sum over the neighbours of codei, jcode assume outside of the grid the values are all code0codes.p  pIf codeXi,j  0code then the first addend guarantees that the the constraints are trivially satisfied. When codeXi, j  1code the constraints guarantee that we have a still life.p  pThe problem is the other rule for a dead cell to remain dead it must have any number of neighbours different from code3code. However, AFAIK you cannot use codecode in a constraint.p  pThe closest Ive come isp  precodeXi, j  i, j  3 gt 0 codepre  pWhich does express what I want, but the problem is that I dont think the absolute value can be used in that way only absolute values of single variables can be expressed. Or is there a way to express this particular situation.p  pI wonder, is there a standard way to express the codecode I was thinking that maybe I should use multiple inequalities instead of a single one e.g. for every possible triplequadruple of neighbours..., but I cannot think of any sensible way to achieve that.p  pOr maybe there is some way of abusing the optimization function to penalize this situation and thus, obtaining an optimum would yield a correct solution or state that its impossible, depending on the value.p  pIs anyone able to express that constraint using a emlinearem inequality and the variables codeXi, jcode plus, eventually, some new variablesp
Negative 2944 pI have a class that uses variables which have to be accessed by another class in a separate module. I therefore used the property decorator to make these properties accessible.

Negative 2944 pI am very keen to implement objectoriented programming OOP capabilities of FORTRAN 2003 F2003. My question is more about the design of the program. Lets say I have a emsolverem, like root finder of a function strongemfx0emstrong in its simplest format in FORTRAN it would get the shape of p  precodefunction solverf,a,b resultroot     [some definition of variables]     [some iterative procedures]     root  ... end function codepre  pIn the previous versions of FORTRAN like f95, to get the portability, the code is compiled separately and an external function is passed to the emsolverem.  Now from F2003 OOP viewpoint, lets say in general case we have a class for the emsolveremp  precodetype solvert    real  a,b,root contains    procedure  solve gt solvesolvert           rootthissolve    [some initialization and postcalculation procedures] end type codepre  pand another class for our curve p  precodetype curvet     [some variable definition] contains     [some initialization procedures]     procedure  func gt functioncurvet     ythisfuncx     procedure  plot gt plotcurve end type codepre  pand there would be more different curve classes types. Now, how can I connect these 2 concepts in a way I compile my solver class without knowing the curve classtype, and  Ill be able to implement it without a change whenever I write a new different curve class like 2ndorderpolynomialcurve, 3rdorderpolynomialcurve, logcurve, expcurve,.... I mean, at the end, somehow I get the roots of the curve.p

Negative 2944 pIm currently learning by doing my own MVC. Ive worked my ways around most of it, however I just ran into a problem I cant seem to figure out.

I have different sections in my view files, and in my main template file I yieldinclude the contents.p  pHowever my issue relies around when typing dollar signs  in my view file, SOME of them are treated as a variable and arent displayed.

Negative 2944 pI am learning spring aspect. So far, I have come across terms jdkproxy and cglib proxy. if i use codeltaopaspectjautoproxy gtcode tag then jdk proxy should be created for the aspect. While if i use codeltaopaspectjautoproxy proxytargetclasstruegtcode then cglib based proxies should be created. This is the understanding i have developed so far after going through online spring doc. Am I correct If yes, then on creating a sample application, and on analyzing aspect call in eclipse debugger, i found that in both cases cglib proxy are being used.p  precodeCglibAopProxy is the class through which aspect call is being made codepre  pI am using spring v4 and specifically for aspect springaop4.1.5.jar p  pCan you help me and let me know where i am going wrongp

Negative 2944 pIm making an msi installer using VC which copies a .jar file into a specified destination. The .jar file is provided with the msi installerDuh. But I need to find the location from which the msi installer is being launched. For example, if I provide the whole setup in a DVD, and the user puts the DVD in the drive, and hisher DVD drive is G, I need the installer to know that it is launched from G drive so that it should look within G for the .jar file. The objective is to make the msi installer launch from anywhere so that the necessary path, from which the support files need to be copied, can be obtained. Currently, the msi installer is being launched from a .cpp file and I have mentioned the path where the .jar file is located specifically to the msi installer in otherwords, hardcoded the path within the c program. I need to obtain the path in realtime. Im a beginner. Could someone please help mep
Negative 2944 pI have been a lurker on this site for a while while I have been designing a small program in JavaScript. I have run into an issue that I cant seem to solve though, and I need your helpp  pYou can find my question at the bottom of the post. in laymans terms, I need help setting up a function loop to compare three values against three values in a nested array, where each value can be compared to all three values in the array.p  pI am working on a type of calculator to find the best way to cut a 3D rectangular piece of material to get the best yield, given a certain cut size I need. I have many different potential sizes of material to cut from, sorted in a nested array, like this  data[i][x] where i  number key of material arrays available, and xeach array is set like so  [material ID, height, width, length, volume]p  pWhat I have is a cut size i need to cut out of the parent material, which consists of height, width, length.p  pThe problem I have run into is the best way to align the cut size in the parent material comparing each value against the other height, width, length to return the highest yield possible.p  pI will mention that I do have a few strongconstraintsstrong.p  pFirst, whatever lines up in the height measurement in the parent material can only be 1 cut size tall. The other two dimensions length and width can be multiple sizes each if they fit.p  pso, to reiterate constraintsp  pstrongHeight must be 1 unit.strongp  pWidth can be multiple unitsp  pLength can be multiple unitsp  pThe orientation of the cut piece does not matter, so long as these constraints are held to.p  pemLength or width can be a decimal, but only whole cut sizes will count.emp  pBelow, I have placed some code I designed to do this, but the problem is it is not nearly dynamic enough, as you can see. it only compares height to height, width to width, and so forth. p  pThe input for this is as followsp  precodecutheight cutwidth cutlength data[i][x]  each nested data array is like so [material ID key, height of material, width of material, length of material, volume of material]    for i  0 i lt data.length i      ifdata[i][1] gt cutheight ampamp data[i][2] gt cutwidth ampamp data[i][3] gt cutlength      insertSortresults, data[i], Math.mindata[i][4]  Math.ceilnumCutPiecesNeeded  Math.floordata[i][2]cutwidth  Math.floordata[i][3]cutlength     the last step in this function determines pieces yielded per material       function insertSortarray, match, materialVolumeMin itterate through the results and see where the new match should be inserted     for j  0 j lt array.length j      if the billetVolumeMin of match is less than the materialVolumeMin of the item at position j         ifarray[j][5] gt materialVolumeMin         insert the match at position j         array.splicej, 0, match         array[j].pushmaterialVolumeMin         return true                    if the materialVolumeMin of match is not less than anything in array then push it to the end. This should also cover the case where this is the first match.      push match     match.pushmaterialVolumeMin     array.pushmatch      set match index 5 to the materialVolumeMin for future comparison     array[array.length 1].pushmaterialVolumeMin     return true  codepre  pWhat this code does is return all the nested arrays with a new value attached to the end, which is in effect the total volume of material needed to get the cuts you need out of it. I use this volume as a way of sorting the arrays to find the most cost effective or highest yield material to use.p  pI believe this is more of a logic question, but I have no idea how to do this. I do know that it would be better to have multiple cuts available on the height axis as well, but due to various factors this is not possible. p  pI also believe that the height should be found first, by comparing all three dimensions of the cut size to the parent material, and finding the one that has the least wastep  pHow I see this maybe happeningp  precodeMath.mindata[i][1]cutheight, data[i][1]cutwidth, data[i][1]cutlength codepre  pFrom there, I really dont know. I appreciate any and all help, advice, or suggestions. Thank youp  pEdit I dont think I was clear in my Question. The code above is how im going about the problem now, but is by no means how I want to actually do it in the finished program.p  pMy question is  How can I set up a function to compare my three sizes to each possible material size in my nested array, and return the best match, where data[i][5] which is data[i][4] volume of material times the number of cut pieces I need, divided by how many fit in said parent material is the smallest out of all of my possible choices.p

Negative 2944 pI dont have much skills with linux. I have a question how I can check which processes use the cpu every 6h and send it to 100 like in this graph. Thanksp  pa hrefhttpswww.dropbox.comsuoin91fe0x2rth7cpu20rasp.JPGdl0 relnofollowhttpswww.dropbox.comsuoin91fe0x2rth7cpu20rasp.JPGdl0ap
Negative 2944 pI am using Javas codeLinkedListcode, and as far as I know, there is no codeLinkedList.nextintcode, but there is codeListIterator.nextcode, which comes into play via codeLinkedList.listIteratorcode. However, as I figured out using codeListIteratorcode to walk over the elements which takes On time will fail after you delete all of them a constanttime operation on the deletion itself, but On to get to the element.p  pTrying to delete some k lt n elements the straightforward way, which is something likep  precodeif list.getindex.equalselementToRemove      list.removeindex  codepre  pis an On2 operation, as each of the n codegetcodes is On.p  pIs there any way to, in linear time, walk through the codeLinkedListcode and delete the elements that should gop
