That takes the original order of the words completely out of the comparison.  A downside to this, however, is that changing just the first letter of a word can create a much bigger disruption than a changing a single letter should cause.p  pWhat Im trying to achieve is to compare two facts about people which are free text strings, and decide how likely these facts are to indicate the same fact.  The facts might be the school someone attended, the name of their employer or publisher, for example.  Two records may have the same school spelled differently, words in a different order, extra words, etc, so the matching has to be somewhat fuzzy if we are to make a good guess that they refer to the same school.  Sofar it is working very well for spelling errors I am using a phoenetic algorithm similar to metaphone on top of this all but very poorly if you switch the order of words around which seem common in a school xxx college vs college of xxx.p

Negative 1554 pDespite what a hrefhttpwww.charlespetzold.cometcDoesVisualStudioRotTheMind.htmlsome might saya, I believe that code completion aka Intellisense is the second best invention when it comes to code editors the first being syntax coloring. It really makes coding easier because I dont have to worry whether I named the function codeCalculateReportSumscode, codeReportSumsCalculatecode or simply codeGetReportSumscode.p  pUnfortunately I have not yet found a code editor which would satisfactory implement this feature for PHP. And by satisfactory I mean as good as Visual Studio for C.p  pMy first choice of text editor is Notepad, but that only has a list of PHPs builtin functions, and it only appears after you hit CtrlSPACE. Ive also tried EclipsePDT, which is better, but still often has hiccups, sometimes fails altogether for no apparent reason no list available, and always appears only when I pause typing setting the timeout to some small value causes the list not to appear altogether.p  pSo  is there something better out there Something that would be aware of all the variables in the current scope, that would be able to follow codeincludecodes, and would display the list in realtime as I typep  pI know that PHP is a dynamic language and a perfect codecompletion is impossible in principle because you dont know what variables will be there until runtime, but it should still be possible to implement it to a fairly good degree  much better than what Ive seen so far.p  pstrongAddedstrong To add a few minor points  I want the CC to be instantaneous, like in Visual Studio. I type a character, and the list shows at the same instant. I type another character and the list becomes half the size before I can even blink. Nearzero CPU usage, instantaneous results all hail the Gods of caching.p  pAlso  Im fine with documenting my functions and even variables in a special way. I prefer PHPLint syntax because then I can check my code with it later, but other syntaxes will do as well. Forcing to do this is also good for your commenting discipline. p

The interface for it would be something likep  ol liCreate a new batch resource via the usual CRUD methodology POST, receive a location to the newly created resource.li liUpdate the batch resource by sending it URLs, HTTP methods, and data to be added to the collection of requests its supposed to later perform in bulk.li liProcess the batch resource, wherein it would iterate over its collection of requests each of which might be represented by a URL, HTTP method, and a set of data, and somehow tell Rails to process those requests in the same way as it would were they coming in as normal, nonbatched requests.li ol  pIt seems to me that there are two important pieces of work that need to happen to make this functionalp  pFirst, the incoming requests need to be somehow saved for later. This could be simply a case of saving various aspects of the incoming request, such as the path, method, data, headers, etc. that are already exposed as part of the incoming request object within a controller. It would be nice if there was a more automatic way of handling thisperhaps something more like object marshaling or serializationbut the brute force approach of recording individual parameters should work as well.p  pSecond, the saved requests need to be able to be reinjected into the rails application at a later time, and go through the same process that a normal HTTP request goes through routing, controllers, views, etc. Id like to be able to capture the response in a string, much as the HTTP client would have seen it, and Id also like to do this using Rails internal machinery rather than simply using an HTTP library to have the application literally make a new request to itself.p  pThoughtsp

These undefined codevoidcode operators close the loophole and ensure a compiletime error. emend noteem]p blockquote  pMy understanding of the loophole is that if we have a codeboolcode conversion function, that conversion may be used in equality comparisons and in other circumstancesp  precodestruct S      operator bool  return false    int main      S a, b     bool areequala  b  Uses operator bool on a and b  Oh no  codepre  pI was under the impression that the safebool idiom in C03 and the use of an explicit conversion function in C11 was used to avoid this loophole.  Boost and TR1 both use the safebool idiom in codefunctioncode and C11 makes the codeboolcode conversion function explicit.p  pAs an example of a class that has both, codestdsharedptrcode both has an explicit codeboolcode conversion function and is equality comparable.p  pWhy is codestdfunctioncode not equality comparable  What is the possible hole in the type system  How is it different from codestdsharedptrcodep

Negative 1554 pBasically, I have a server application and associated agent process for communicating heartbeat data to the server.  The server application implements a TCP socket class TCPDevice, which is called from a WinForm.  I am aware of the restriction on updating the UI from processes running on separate threads, and that the preferred technique for acheiving this is via the use of Delegates in conjunction with the Invoke method.  Having had very little need previously for using Delegates apart from of course std windows events and the BackGroundWorker control, I am at a loss as to how to do this in the context of my application, and would appreciate some assistance, although it has occurred to me that I could use the backgroundworker for marshalling updates to the UI.p  pEventually the application will need to update a grid of devices via feeds from the defined agents, however for the purpose of this exercise simply updating a status bar on the UI will suffice.  The section of the code which I believe is relevant to propogating the code to the form is contained in the OnDataReceived method.p  pBelow is a code excerpt from the protoype app which should put the above into appropriate contextp  pstrongCode from the formstrongp  precodePrivate device As TcpDevice  Private Sub btnListenClickByVal sender As System.Object,      ByVal e As System.EventArgs Handles btnListen.Click         device  New TcpDeviceuxIPaddress.Text, uxHost.Text, CIntuxPort.Text         device.Listen         Me.btnListen.Enabled  False End Sub codepre  pstrongCode from TCPDevice Classstrong p  precodePublic Class TcpDevice  Implements CNIMonitor.Core.Domain.IDevice      Private ipAddress As String     Private hostName As String     Private port As Integer     Private status As Integer     Private previousStatus As Integer     Private listener As TcpListener     Private localAdd As System.Net.IPAddress       Private activeConnection As TcpClient     Private receiveBuffer0 As Byte     Private sendBuffer As Byte     Private message As String     Private dataRead As Integer The value returned from the getstream.endread method       Public Sub NewByVal ipAddress As String, ByVal HostName As String, ByVal port As String         ipAddress  ipAddress         hostName  HostName         port  port     End Sub      Public Sub Connect Implements CNIMonitor.Core.Domain.IDevice.Connect      End Sub      Public Sub Disconnect Implements CNIMonitor.Core.Domain.IDevice.Disconnect          activeConnection.Close         listener.Stop          activeConnection  Nothing      End Sub      Public Property HostName As String Implements CNIMonitor.Core.Domain.IDevice.HostName         Get             HostName  hostName         End Get         SetByVal value As String             hostName  value         End Set     End Property      Public Property IPAddress As String Implements CNIMonitor.Core.Domain.IDevice.IPAddress         Get             IPAddress  ipAddress         End Get         SetByVal value As String             ipAddress  value         End Set     End Property      Public Sub Listen Implements CNIMonitor.Core.Domain.IDevice.Listen         Try             Server component listens on the specified tcpip port             localAdd  System.Net.IPAddress.ParseipAddress             listener  New TcpListenerlocalAdd, port             listener.Start             listener.BeginAcceptTcpClientAddressOf OnClientConnect, listener             Update the status message                             Debug.WriteLineListening for host   ipAddress   on port   port.ToString  .

Negative 1554 pI am very new to web development about a month and i have run into something strange.p  pI am using VS2010, MVC 3 Razor to create a simple app. p  pI have two tables holding the same type of information. As in both table A and Table B hold users. the Difference being, Table A has users who are in the Role, and table B holds the users who are not in the Role.p  pBoth tables have two columns, One with the user name, the other holds a Ajax.ActionLink.p  pSo, to add a user to Table B, I click the Ajax.Actionlink on Table A. The add is save through the MVC action, and i move the Table Row using AjaxOption OnSuccess event. The OnSuccess event basically, moves the Row, and alters the Ajax.ActionLink so the newly added User rows ActionLink will Remove the User.p  pI hope thats clear.p  pThis all works fine. I can add user A to the table A and everything works fine. I can remove user A from table A to table B and everything is fine. But I can not readd User A to table A. The OnSuccess runs, so the row is move, but the Action event is not called. So if i refresh the screen i can see the move did not actually take place. it is the same if i start with User B on table B. Also, a page refresh F5 does not fix the links, the remain broken until i close and reopen the page.p  pEverything looks good in the HTML, it shows in the status bar that when i click the link, the correct href is being called, but fiddler registers no call and the action is not called.p  pI suspect i have some sort of binding issues, but i am lost here. Everything works fine in Firefoxp  pPlease help. Code below, with Comments added. Remember this works to add and remove, remove and add, but readd and reremove only calls the function but does not call the Action. So i know the Actions are spelt correctly etc.p  precode element is the ID of the element i am Moving  targetElement is the ID of the tbody i am moving the element to function moveelementelement, targetElement      try               get the HTM         var elementHTML  tr[id  element  ].children.Action.html         based on the tbody id        switch targetElement                 case AssignedToGroup              Change the target body for next call to this function             elementHTML  elementHTML.replaceAssignedToGroup, UnassignedToGroup              change th action name             elementHTML  elementHTML.replaceAddGroupRole, DeleteGroupRole              change the display label             elementHTML  elementHTML.replaceAssign, Remove             break        case UnassignedToGroup             elementHTML  elementHTML.replaceUnassignedToGroup, AssignedToGroup             elementHTML  elementHTML.replaceDeleteGroupRole, AddGroupRole             elementHTML  elementHTML.replaceRemove, Assign             break             Create the new Ajax lttdgt element       tr[id  element  ].children.Action.replaceWithlttd  classActiongt  elementHTML   lttdgt        Add the row to the other body       tr[id  element  ].appendTotbody[id  targetElement  ]        catch e           alerte.Message NO ERROR IS RAISED      codepre

Negative 1554 pI am working on an application that will have a background process running for quite a while and I want to report progress to the UI.

I found a wonderful article by Stephen Cleary that shows this and includes a class, ProgressReporter article link at the bottom.p  pI could just take the class and use it asis, but then I dont own the knowledge.

Negative 1554 pGood Morning,p  pI have a dynamic set of methods which all have the same return type codeResultSetcode.

Negative 1554 pIn my application there are some cases that relatively small objects, max 50 bytes e.g. message classes for logging purposes, must be created and freed by GC frequently during the execution of the program. So I am worried about the overhead of dynamic allocation of these objects. As stated in this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions147298multithreadedmemoryallocatorsforccquestiona there are some usable fast memory allocators for native code.br Is there a concept of fast memory allocation in .Net or is fast memory allocation needed in .Net If not what can be used to speed up that kind of implementation Maybe some kind of a preallocated object pool. Should I worry about the overheadp
Negative 1554 pMy hierarchy isp  pRecord is a super class, there are many classes that extends Record, say WellnessRecord.   There is another class Note.

So the problem should be the GAEs support for polymorphismp  pMy hypothesis for the problem is that When addNote or editNote, I find the Record first and modify Note via Record, since Record can easily find the Note, it goes well.p  pBut when deleteNote, after delete the object in memory, GAE tracks the modification and want to delete the Note in the database, but it couldnt find the Owner Record via Note since Notes record is null.p  pThats my problem in detail. p  pIn a word 3 classes A,B, and C.

Negative 1554 pI am working on an Android app to handle workorders for technicians in the field First let me explain the layout of my appbr The main part of the app contains 3 tabs  p  pTab 1  Home Tabbr contains a summary of the current workorders that are openp  pTab 2  Assigned Workorders Tabbr contains a list of workorders that are currently assigned to the user who logged inp  pTab 3  Unassigned Workorders Tabbr contains a list of workorders that are assigned to the users crew, but not to a specific personp  pI use a class called Database that is a Singleton class that is part of the Application context so that it can be accessed throughout the entire app. I will include some code from it below p  pHeres the issuebr When the user click a particular workorder in the list, a workorder detail activity launches displaying all kinds of information about the workorder. If the workorder is an unassigned one, it also displays a Take Ownership button that changes the owner field to the current user, removes it from the unassigned list, and adds it to the assigned list for that user. However, once the user hits the back button to close the workorder detail screenactivity, and goes back to the tabs view, the lists do not update until you somehow force the view to refresh such as scrolling farther down on the list so that the workorder that just changed ownership is off the screen. p  pI have triedbr moving the custom ListAdapter into the Database singleton class and accessing it through there calling notifyDataSetChanged on the list adaptersp  pDoes anyone have any ideas for how to get it to update each time a tab is selected or the workorder detail screen is dismissed by hitting the back button Ive been scouring the internet trying to find a solution and have not succeeded with anything I found, so I post here once again, knowing that most people here are smarter than mep  pThanks in advance for your help I have included relevant code belowp  pDatabase classp  precodepublic class Database extends Application      private static Database instance  null         private ArrayListltWorkordergt assignedwolist     private ArrayListltWorkordergt unassignedwolist     private Credentials creds     private WOListAdapter assignedadapter     private WOListAdapter unassignedadapter      private static void checkInstance          ifinstancenull              throw new IllegalStateExceptionDatabase class not created yet                    Override     public void onCreate          super.onCreate         instancethis           public Database          this.credsnull         this.assignedwolist  getAssignedWorkorders         this.unassignedwolist  getUnassignedWorkorders         this.assignedadapternew WOListAdapterthis,getAssignedWorkorders         this.unassignedadapternew WOListAdapterthis,getUnassignedWorkorders           public ArrayListltStringgt getSummary          int numassigned  assignedwolist.size         int assignedp1  0         forWorkorder woassignedwolist              ifwo.getPriority.equalsIgnoreCase1                  assignedp1                               int numunassigned  unassignedwolist.size         int unassignedp1  0         forWorkorder wounassignedwolist              ifwo.getPriority.equalsIgnoreCase1                  unassignedp1                               ArrayListltStringgt summary  new ArrayListltStringgt         summary.addInteger.toStringnumassigned         summary.addInteger.toStringassignedp1         summary.addInteger.toStringnumunassigned         summary.addInteger.toStringunassignedp1         return summary           public Workorder getWOString id          forWorkorder woassignedwolist              ifwo.getId.equalsIgnoreCaseid                  return wo                               forWorkorder wounassignedwolist              ifwo.getId.equalsIgnoreCaseid                  return wo                               return null           public ArrayListltWorkordergt getAssignedWorkorders          return assignedwolist           public ArrayListltWorkordergt getUnassignedWorkorders          return unassignedwolist           public void setValidatedboolean validated          this.validated  validated           public boolean isValidated          return validated           public void takeOwnershipString wonum          Workorder wo         forint i0iltunassignedwolist.sizei              ifunassignedwolist.geti.getId.equalsIgnoreCasewonum                  wo  unassignedwolist.removei                 wo.setOwnercreds.getUsername                 assignedwolist.addwo                 Collections.sortassignedwolist                 return                               this.assignedadapter.notifyDataSetChanged         this.unassignedadapter.notifyDataSetChanged           public WOListAdapter getAssignedAdapter          return assignedadapter           public WOListAdapter getUnassignedAdapter          return unassignedadapter       codepre  pMain App contains Tabsp  precodepublic class MainApp extends TabActivity         Called when the activity is first created.

Negative 1554 pI am using the codeFlipperViewcode to create a wizard like process flow through my application. Within my Activity I inflate the various Views for each page of the flipper and add them in codeonCreatecode.p  pMy problem is that some of the strongpagesstrong contain codeEditTextcode widgets and others contain none. If I leave the default emIMFem behaviour, the user is expected to touch into the codeEditTextcode to show the keyboard. The problem then, is when they go to the next screen without any codeEditTextcode, the keyboard remains and must be manually hidden. Ideally it should be hidden again.p  pI have tried various calls to codeshowSoftInputcode or codetoggleSoftInputcode but have not yet achieved the desired effect of automatically showing the keyboard when a page is shown with an codeEditTextcode, and hiding when there is none. p  pstrongIs this possiblestrong I thought of calling codeshowSoftInputcode for each View added to my codeFlipperViewcode where I want the keyboard shown, but this is not having the desired effect.

Negative 1554 pI have a chicken and egg problem, its trivial, so I thought I would ask whats the normal pattern to save an aggregate root where all the primary keys are identity fields.p  pI have a typical contact entityp  precode Customer        HomeAddress               WorkAddress           codepre  pwhere both addresses are stored in the address table and the only primary key is the identity field.  We check all fields against each other to keep unique address records.p  pHeres the problemp  ol liI need to retrieve the Address identity field to hookup the foreign keys, so I save the Address record prior to saving the Customer record only if its unique, otherwise I load that existing Address.li liIf Address is in the same DC as Customer, then customer saves too prematurely not all records are set.li liIf Address is in a separate DC, then it doesnt hookup to the Customer record that has its own DC because you cannot have an entity associated with two DCs cant open in one, then save in another.li ol  pSo my thinking is that I would need a separate repository for every Address, then separately load the address again in the other DC, making redundant calls to the database for the same information.p  pstrongIs there a way to partially save records in a data context  container in Entity Framework 4.1  For example, to save Address by itself while still being in the same DCstrongp

Negative 1554 pNot sure if there is another thread with the answer, but tried looking and nothing stood out.p  pOur company runs Windows Server 2008 R2 and as part of the normal login procedure you type your username and password.

So, when you open IE, the intranet sight detects that you are person XXX YYY and then logs you into the site automatically as the right person.p  pNow is there any way that I can do the same with an application written in C or VB.NET. I.e., I would like the user to not have to log in as they have already done so during Windows log in, and then use the application as the indicidual user.

Negative 1554 pI have a codeHorizontalScrollViewcode inside my codeViewPagercode. I set  coderequestDisallowInterceptTouchEventtruecode for the codeHorizontalScrollViewcode but the codeViewPagercode is still sometimes intercepting touch events.  Is there another command I can use to prevent a Views parent and ancestors from intercepting touch eventsp  pnote the codeHorizontalScrollViewcode only occupies half the screen.p

Im trying to interface in some data in an XML file.  i believe my file matches the applications required schema correctly, but i get the message Could not find schema information for the element for every element in my file.  Ive decomplied the applications code and rebuilt it in visual studio, and i get the error myself.p  pIm going to go ahead and just dump the code...

Negative 1554 pI have an openGLaudio iOS application and several UIViewControllers that are presented popovers or modal views when a button is pressed. When the controllers are createdshown they pause the main openGLaudio thread for .51 second while opening.p  pTo combat this, I tried allocating all the view controllers theres not that many when the application loads  rather than each time theyre used. However, even though theyre allocatedcreated early on, the first time theyre shown they still are slow to appear and pause the main thread. After the first time each one is loaded, the next times it is quick and does not pause anything. p  pIs there a way to preload the UIViewControllers It seems that allocating from nib is not the slow down since that occurs when the app starts and therefore its something with presenting the view. Each UIViewController UIView only has 45 sliders and 23 buttons. There really isnt that much where it should take time to load.p  pIs there a way to thread this somehow to avoid the lag From what I understand UIKit elements can only run in the main thread.p

Negative 1554 pI have a EJB2EJB3 Java project in Eclipse.

Write one word, see Update JPA Project appear on status bar, wait 30 seconds CPU under high load, Eclipse totally unresponsive, then continue and write next word..p  pThe project that makes JPA slow is mediumsized, not just a simple webstore, but not enterpriseclass either.

Negative 1554 pIve read many different articlesthreads on this, but have yet to determine the best way to perform Apache Commons logging in my JSP.p  pTo provide some context, I am adding improved error logic to an application that was originally developed using Spring 2. So now we have Controllers that were created using Spring 2 and Spring 3.p  pSo rather than using Spring MVC 3s Exception Handling at Controller level, I think it would be best to have a JSP configured in the web.xml that would log all propogated exceptions for all Controllers.p  pSurprisingly, I dont see an easy way to perform logging within a JSP using tag libraries. Apache Commons seems to have a retired tag library for logging, but this is based on log4j as opposed to Apache Commons Logging itself.p  pSo, instead Im performing the following programmatically within my JSPp  precode    lt page languagejava contentTypetexthtml charsetISO88591     pageEncodingISO88591gt ltDOCTYPE html PUBLIC W3CDTD HTML 4.01 TransitionalEN httpwww.w3.orgTRhtml4loose.dtdgt lt page importorg.apache.commons.logging.Log gt lt page importorg.apache.commons.logging.LogFactory gt lt page isErrorPagetrue gt lt Log logger  LogFactory.getLogthis.getClass gt lthtmlgt ltheadgt ltheadgt ltbodygt     lt          StringBuilder stringBuilder  new StringBuildern  exception          forStackTraceElement element  exception.getStackTrace                      stringBuilder.appendn  element.toString                  logger.errorUnhandled exception caught   stringBuilder.toString      gt     ltpgtText hereltpgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pSo my question is this....is there a better way to perform this logging The above works, but seems unnecessarily awkward for what should be a common taskp

Negative 1554 pI am playing around with learning C by writing a small game. As a part of this, I am mapping input from devices to an enum which contains ingame actions, defined from a dictionary of button,action pairs. p  pFor example, I have something like, schematicallyp  precode[Flags] enum Actions  None0, MoveUp1, MoveDown2, MoveLeft4, MoveRight8   Actions currentActions  private void SetActions   currentActions  Actions.None   if UpPressed      currentAction  Actions.MoveUp  etc    public void Update   SetActions  if currentActions amp Actions.MoveUp  Actions.MoveUp      MoveUp  etc  codepre  pI set the actions based on input, then I update the games state depending upon which actions are in the list.p  pWhat I would like to do, is have a new class, ActionManager that contains the actionrelated data and methodsp  precodepublic Enum currentActions public void SetActions public void UpdateActions codepre  pand other classes, e.g., a class corresponding to a menu, can add their own enums to this global Enum, so that each set of possible actions is defined inside of each class responsible for handling input, instead of being predefined in a global enum.p  pBut I cant do this, because I cannot add to or remove from an enum, and I cannot inherit from System.Enum. The only way I can think of to do this involves lists of enumsp  precode In class ActionManager public ListltEnumgt allowedActions  new ListltEnumgt public ListltEnumgt currentActions  new ListltEnumgt  public void SetActionsEnum action   currentActions.Clear  foreach Enum e in allowedActions      if IsKeyPressede                       currentActions.Adde    In, say, GameMenu class [Flags] enum MenuActions  None0, MenuUp  1, ...   private actionManager ActionManager  new ActionManager  public void DefineActions   foreach MenuActions m in Enum.GetValuestypeofMenuActions      actionManager.allowedActions.Addm      also define the key corresponding to the action       here, from e.g., a config file      and put this into a Dictionaryltbuttons, actionsgt   public Update   actionManager.Update   if actionManager.currentActions.ContainsMenuActions.MenuUp  etc  codepre  pBut this seems stupid, Ive replaced cheap logical operations with a list of Enums, which seems awkward. It also forces me to use .Contains etc, instead of arithmetic, and use reference types where value types would make more sense and generic lists shouldnt be exposed to the outside anyway.p  pI realize I could also replace my List with an int, and cast all my other classs enums to ints so I can or actions together, but this doesnt have the type safety of enums.p  pSo, my questions are Is there a way to do this with enums Is there a smarter way to do this kind of thing in general either with enums or another way entirelyp  pI am doing this to learn the language, so I would appreciate comments if theres a much better way to do something like thisp

Negative 1554 pI am a novice at making websites but i need some help concerning my project. I have done some research and also some analysis on how to create websites but i have a problem. I want to create a social photo sharing website in which users can upload photos from their iphones unto the website via an app. I am considering using a database engine which can be used for both app and the website or should i just use different databases for both sites.I need suggestions how to go about this problem.p  pTolup
Negative 1554 pIm looking for some general advice on the model I should be using for my scenario.p  pBasically I have a program that loads codeGISFilecode objects, which I store in a codeListltGISFilegtcode within a codeProjectcode object. Usually there would be just the one codeProjectcode object, but I want to allow for multiple projects to be loaded at one time if necessary, and so within the program there is a single codeListltProjectgtcode.p  pThe program has different classes associated with WindowsForms I am using WPF but that should not be relevant to this which all need access to the list of codeProjectscode, but they view completely different aspects of the data, e.g. the main one gives a top down map view of the spatial position of the objects, where as another graphs a specific attribute of some of the data, and another a further different attribute etc... hence the reason they are separate. More such views may be added eventually. The classes related to each of these views are fairly large, running to a couple of thousand lines. Each view class may add files to the codeListltProjectgtcode via a load dialog in their associated window.p  pMy question is how best to share the data across the classes. I currently have a static data store but I gather that this technique seems to be discouraged in favour of more object oriented design, and I want my design to be as good as possible.p  pIs it viable to initialise the different view classes with a reference to the data, e.g.p  precodeAlternativeView  new AlternativeViewref MyProjects codepre  pIf this is not good practice, what is the best wayp  pIt works with static methods and classes, but I want my design to be as good as possible for future maintenance.p  pAny advice is much appreciated.p
Negative 1554 pWhen I use grep in TEST line 18 it works perfectly. When I do the exact same command, but inside the forloop line 40, it does not work. Why Ive bent my brain on this problem too long now.p  precodebinbash clear             sourcelistls .c headerlistls .h FILEheaders.txt  TESTreceiveelevatordata this is one typical entry in headers.tex echo TEST grep TEST .c n  MODEh  if [ MODE  h ] then echo Searching.. for entry in cut f 1 FILE for entry in cat FILE     do     echo Looking at entry in FILE      echo entry     echo Press any button to search, ltsgt for skip, ltegt to exit     read e INPUT2     if [ INPUT2  s ]     then         continue     fi     if [ INPUT2  n ]     then         exit 1 exit shell script     else         grep n entry sourcelist     fi done fi codepre  pJust to clarify every line in headers.txt has strings like test, i.e no space in the lines. What headers.txt really contains is a list of function names extracted from all headerfiles in a C project  There was no returned error in my previous code, it was just the grep command in the loop that wouldnt run. What I want to do, is to search through all C files for each function in headers.txt, and prompt me before each searchp
Negative 1554 pI am writing a program to select words from a txt file. Compiling flags stdgnu99 The program has some segmentation faults that I am debugging with GDB and Valgrind.

If yes, it increase the word count. Otherwise it will add the word to the array. If there is no space, the function increases array space.li lithe main is quiet linear.

Negative 1554 pIm working on a script to create metrics for online author identification.  One of the things I came across in the literature is to count the frequency of each letter how many as, how many bs, etc independent of upper or lower case.  Since I dont want to create a separate statement for each letter, Im trying to loop the thing, but I cant figure it out.  The best I have been able to come up with is converting the ASCII letter code in to hex, and then...hopefully a miracle happens.p  pSo far, Ive gotp  precodeelement  id.toLowerCase var hex  0 for k97 klt122 k     hex  k.toString16 gets me to hex     letter  element.replace[hex]g, remove everything but the current letter Im looking for     return letter.length  the length of the resulting string is how many times the ltter came up     codepre  pbut of course, when I do that, it interprets hex as the letters h e x, not the hex code for the letter I want.p

Negative 1554 pMy goal is this p  pSuppose that a random number r is generated every second. I would like to write an application preferably in C though if a language where this is easier is suggested Ill choose that so that the application prints r every second to the text field selected by the user at that instant. p  pHere is a use case a user is running 3 applications in win7 64 bit, the applications are notepad, chrome browser, and mspaint. The user selects mspaint through alttab and clicks on the text box tool. He creates a textbox on the screen and clicks on it so that the cursor is in the text box. During this process 5 seconds pass and the application has generated 5 random numbers, since the cursor was never located in a text field nothing was printed. The instant the cursor is in the text field a second has passed, and a new number is generated. This number prints to the text box. The user keeps the cursor in the text box, another second passes and the new random number will overwrite the previous random number and anything else in the text field with the new random number. If the user switches the cursor position to the url selection portion of chrome similar behavior should be exhibited. Similarly with the search field of google.com inside chrome, and again in notepad. If the cursor were in notepad for 3 seconds then every second the full textbox inside notepad would be replaced with a random number, at the end of the 3 seconds only the last random number will be in notepad. p  pIn short I want to be able to overwrite any text field selected by a user in win7. p  pAny help p

Negative 1554 pIs there a way to suppress displaying an inline template if no object exists to display in the inline Id rather hide the inline altogether than display an inline with blanknull values.p  pIve tried to do this two ways, first by using conditional logic to set the codemodelcode attribute of codeInlineModelAdmincode to codeNonecode when the object itself is codeNonecode. This doesnt work because Im dealing with a class object in the inline definition, not instances of the class itself.p  pMy second approach has been to modify the ModelAdmin with a similar approach. Same problem.p  pI havent tried to modify the template, but it seems like that might be the best approach.p  pModifying the queryset doesnt seem to work because the queryset is already returning an empty set.p
Negative 1554 pI want the size of a C struct to be multiple of 16 bytes 16B32B48B... It does not matter which size it gets to, it only needs to be multiple of 16B. How could I enforce the compiler to do that Thanks.p

There is a particular method that receives a complex object and returns the same object type possibly modified.p  pThe serialization works ok, but the deserialization is not working. The atributos tag is causing the error.p  pDoes anyone know whether it is possible to use the same registered data type for both ways or at least a better way than doying that by hand Ill have to do for a lot of methodsp  pSorry for the long long long message.

Negative 1554 pI have recently upgraded the app from WP7 7.0 to 7.1. Now every time the application gets deactivated and reactivated I press the Home button and then the back button the navigation will stop working completely. The NavigationService will return true and not throw any exceptions, while the navigation will simply be ignored, thus breaking the application.p  pI dont know what is causing the problem. RootFrameNavigationFailed also doesnt catch anything, and the event is simply ignored.p
Negative 1554 pIm trying to understand whether and under what circs one should use Python classes andor Java ones.  p  pIf making a specialist dictionaryMap kind of class, should one subclass from Pythons dict, or from Javas HashMap or TreeMap, etc.p  pIt is tempting to use the Python ones just because they are simpler and sexier.  But one reason that Jython runs relatively slowly so it appears to me to do seems to have something to do with the dynamic typing.  Id better say Im not that clear about all this, and havent spent nocturnal hours poring over the PythonJython interpreter code, to my shame.p  pAnyway it just occurs to me that the Java classes might possibly run faster because the code might have to do less work.  OTOH maybe it has to do more.  Or maybe theres nothing in it.  Anyone knowp

Worse off, the border has to very small rounded edges point upwards which looks a bit tacky to me and Id like to fix that too.p  pIm not sure what classes I have to alter in order to achieve having unselected tabs rest on the border, while the selected tab I assume hovers over the border just enough to cover it giving it the illusion that that piece of border is now missing.

Negative 1554 pIm working on a website which requires mouseover menus. I would not recommend mouseover menus from an accessibility point of view, but its pretty easy to implement using jQuery.p  pThe problem we also need to support touchscreen devices tablets. On such a device you dont have a mouse and, so the mouseover event is not working. I was hoping for jQuery to have a longpress event, but it doesnt. I did find a a hrefhttpsgithub.compisiLongclick relnofollowjQuery longclick plugina using Google, but it was for jQuery 1.4, so Im not keen on using that. Also the jQuery plugin site is under maintenance at the moment, so that is not very helpful.p  pSo the question is there an elegant plugin for jQuery 1.7  1.8 to support longpress  longclick eventsp

Negative 1554 pSo far most of the stuff in this combined setup works well enough. However, when I try to conditionally disable filters, they are simply always enabled.

Negative 1554 pIm making this 2d TD game for android.

This results in that if I want each monstertexture to have the resolution of 100x100px, the walking bitmap will end up as a 7000x15000px picture. This ofc. crashes my application, but at the same time I need everything that is inside that picture, and I dont want to reduce the resolution.

Unfortunately, in my country developers can not use Google Checkout API. Another way is to periodically check the order state via device using GETPURCHASEINFORMATION request passing known notification ids and new nonces. If the check fails during some period the purchase will be automatically expired until the first successful order state verification.

Negative 1554 pI feel like this will probably be immediately obvious to any of the nonamateurs out there, but Ive been stumped on this for days.p  pI am writing a Chrome Extension that executes a script at document start.  I want to rewrite the HTML of specific DIVs as they load, but before they are displayed to the user so the user doesnt see the sites HTML before it is unceremoniously replaced by my custom HTML.

I cant figure out why it works for some divs and not for others.p  pI dont know if this is relevant, but on the Chrome side I havep  precodechrome.tabs.getSelectednull, functiontab       iftab.url.indexOfsearch.php gt 1         chrome.tabs.executeScriptnull,             file fhrun.js, allFrames false, runAt documentstart                 codepre  pAny ideas of why this isnt working, or a better method that I should be using  Thanksp

Negative 1554 pOk so I have a web application that I am trying to set up to allow a user to upload an audio file via httpPost.  The problem I have is that the function I am using takes in the files as an HttpPostedFileBase.  When I debug I can see the file format as an audio format but I cant seem to convert it.

I am purposely avoiding using a file system where I store this file, it will be stored via database as a whole so I cant use the paths.  I am trying to play the file directly.  The ideas that I have looked into are changing the input type on the cshtml from file to something else that might work or finding a way to convert the HttpPostedFileBase would work as well.

Negative 1554 pAs it stands, I have a map with roads on it and vehicles are able to drive back and forth from south to north and east to west and opposite ways as well. I have used JPanels thus far to represent the vehicles. However now its becoming a bit difficult to handle because I want to turn the vehicles at junctions and smooth lane changing etc.p  pSo it doesnt seem like JPanel is the optimal choice for this. What Ive tried so far is to use the codeShapecode interface to draw polygons and use these as vehicles, however Im not sure that this is the right choice.p  pI will eventually want to construct my own vehicle image so the solution will have to either be able to add the image as its background or something similar and still be able to perform operations such as rotation, transformation etc.p  pAny guidance on this will be much appreciated. p

It is also centered, but that I seem to be able to get to work.  The inside div has a explicit width, which I need to be able to do.  The height should be determined by the amount of content.  Ive tried various solutions Ive seen on stackoverflow, but none of them seem to quite work right.  A few of them seem to work if there is no explicit width on the inner div, or if the horizontal centering is not necessary.  This question is different from others in that those do not have explicit widths, or when they do, the solutions include static padding, or javascript which calculates padding.

Negative 1554 pI am trying to create a very open plugin framework in c, and it seems to me that I have come up with a way to do so, but a nagging thought keeps telling me that there is something very, very wrong with what I am doing, and it either wont work or it will cause problems.p  pThe design I have for my framework consists of a Kernel that calls each plugins codeinitcode function. The init function then turns around and uses the Kernels coderegisterPlugincode and coderegisterFunctioncode to get a unique id and then register each function the plugin wants to be accessible using that id, respectively.p  pThe function registerPlugin returns the unique id. The function registerFunction takes that id, the function name, and a generic function pointer, like sop  precodebool registerFunctionint pluginid, string functionname, pluginfunction func codepre  pwhere pluginfunction isp  precodetypedef void pluginfunction codepre  pThe kernel then takes the function pointer and puts it in a map with the codefunctionnamecode and codepluginidcode. All plugins registering their function must caste the function to type codepluginfunctioncode.p  pIn order to retrieve the function, a different plugin calls the Kernelsp  precodepluginfunction getFunctionstring pluginname, string functionname codepre  pThen that plugin must cast the codepluginfunctioncode to its original type so it can be used. It knows in theory what the correct type is by having access to a code.hcode file outlining all the functions the plugin makes available. Plugins, by the by, are implemented as dynamic libraries.p  pIs this a smart way to accomplish the task of allowing different plugins to connect with each other Or is this a crazy and really terrible programming technique If it s, please point me in the direction of the correct way to accomplish this.p  pEDIT If any clarification is needed, ask and it will be provided.p

Negative 1554 pIve created a page where I have two input textareas and I add CKeditor ver. 4 to both of them.p  pThe first editor works fine, Ive set codeconfig.allowedContent  truecode in the config.js to stop stripping tags like codeltscriptgtcode and everything works as expected.br  I have another editor right below it, same settings, same setup, I just changed the ID of the textarea field. It works when I submit normal text, but as soon as I add a codeltscriptgtcode tag, for example, and press the submit button of the form in which the editors are in it seems to reload the page, doesnt submit any data and firebug tells me that the server returns 403.p  pI tried isolating the editor, adding personal configuration.

Negative 1554 pI have a page that serves two purposes, mostly viewing an entry in the database, but some of the fields are displayed in textfieldstextareas because you can edit some values and then depending on the button you select at the bottom, you can update those entries.  I especially like the textarea because of its lookfeel, naturally resizeable in the page, and comes with standard rightclick options like SelectAll, etc. thx to browser support.  p  pAnyway, one of those fields shown in a textarea Id like to prevent from coming through upon postback because that value isnt going to be edited Ive even made it readonly so you cant even edit the textarea.p  pHow to accomplish preventing form postback for an input from the ASPX page  I know that is counterintuitive in general, but I thought perhaps theres a way similar to the Hidden inputs.  Also, I know that in the controller I could just wipe that field in the model before doing anything with the model submitted from the form, but Im curious if there is some option from the page that I could do.p  pIm using this syntax to define the textareabrp  precodelt Html.TextAreaFormodel gt model.Key, new  readonly  readonly, class  readonly, cols  62, rows  15 gt codepre  pbEDITbbr I probably should have noted that one of the main reasons I need to do this is because one of the model fields may contain some HTML in it.  This is an internal website and that field cannot be edited manually, so no one can input HTML, it is just a value in the database that comes from a license generation program.  And so, when I use a TextArea in a form that is bound to a model field, ASP.NET throws an exception upon binding the TextArea data back to the model to send upon postback.p  pI saw the SO answers using [AllowHtml] and [ValidateInputfalse] attributes, one wasnt available to me in MVC2 and the other requires downgrading the requestValidationMode, so I am looking for an alternative way to prevent the possible HTML value from being posted back at all but still displayed in a textarea.p

The thing is, I want to apply this kind of effect to a 2D sidescroller.p  pImagine a game like Terraria where both ends of the screen left and right sides are slightly bent downward to give the illusion of curvature.p  pI have tried to find an article explaining how to achieve such an effect, but I havent much in the way of helpful direction pointing.  I know this isnt the most organized or wellput question, but any help would be appreciated.p
Negative 1554 pI have to set custom request headers for my ajax calls POST. As Im behind a clientserver framework a hrefhttpzkoss.org relnofollowZKa, I cant master the whole process from open to send. Thats why I can only set the request headers as follows, overriding native onsomething functions p  precodevar zknativefunctiontoinstanciateaxhrOLD  zknativefunctiontoinstanciateaxhr zknativefunctiontoinstanciateaxhr  function      var xhr  zknativefunctiontoinstanciateaxhrOLD      xhr.onloadstart  function         if xhr.readyState  1          xhr.setRequestHeaderXXMYCUSTOMHEADER, foobarhimself              codepre  pThis works very well using Chrome, but doesnt work at all on Firefox. The point is that using Firefox, I only get ready state 4 when I put a breakpoint at the if line. Using Chrome, my breakpoint stops successfully with codexhr.readyStatecode equal to 1 codexhr.OPENEDcode, and xhr.readyState still equals 1 when executing codexhr.setRequestHeader...code.p  pAnd yet, both with Chrome and Firefox, codezknativefunctiontocreateaxhrOLDcode returns me an instance of XMLHttpRequest object with same default attributes.p  pBoth calls, ie. the codesendcode on Chrome and on Firefox are made asynchronously. To top it all, when I remove the breakpoint on firebug, my line codexhr.setRequestHeadercode seems to be reached because when executed I get following error on console p  pstrongInvalidStateError An attempt was made to use an object that is not, or is no longer, usablestrongp  pIn my opinion, thats because at the time xhr.setRequestHeader is called, xhr.readyState already equals 4... Its value changes from 1 to 4 at the speed of life p  pHow can I resolve this issue  Or is there another way I can call xhr.setRequestHeader, or in another prototypable onsomething handler p  pThanks a lot.p

Negative 1554 pIm having big problems with variable size signals in simulink. I have a matlab function block with a function which should accept a variable size run time array and it need to evaluate the output. In particular the input array is a 1xn array with integers and every integer represent a section of a trajectory for example a sequence of straight line, straight line, circle, half circle, straight line could be represented by the array [1 1 2 3 1]. This array, so the trajectory, could change in the simulation path planning for robots but i get tons of errors. I have put variable size in the dataports for the input without size and for the outputs with size representing the upper bound. If I put an uppe bound in input, simulink expects exactly an input with that dimension even if I put variable size.p  pI think Simulink generates errors because not knowing the input size, it isnt able to allocate memory. Some helpp  pThank youp  pA little part of code...prim is the variable size input, while all the outputs are variable size.p  precodefunction [x, y, vx, vy, ax, ay, tf]  trajectoryPlanUniformprim, discr, xdiscr,   ydiscr, xi, yi, vmax, amax  len  sizeprim, 2  tf  zeros1, len1 tf1, 1  0 x  zeros6, len y  zeros6, len  vx  zeros6, len vy  zeros6, len  ax  zeros6, len ay  zeros6, len  xitemp  xdiscr yitemp  ydiscr vxitemp  0 vyitemp  0 vftemp  vmax axitemp  0 ayitemp  0 aftemp  amax  xytot  zeros2,len1 xytot1,1  xi xytot2,1  yi  for i  1len     [x,i, y,i, vx,i, vy,i, ax,i, ay,i, tfi1]  trajectoryCallUniformprimi, discr, xitemp, yitemp, vxitemp, vyitemp, vftemp, axitemp, ayitemp, aftemp, tfi, vmax, amax      [xitemp, yitemp, vxitemp, vyitemp, axitemp, ayitemp]  calculateTrajectoryUniformprimi, x,i, y,i, vx,i, vy,i, ax,i, ay,i, tfi1      xytot1,i1  xitemp     xytot2,i1  yitemp      if i  len  1         vftemp  0         aftemp  0     end end  end codepre

Negative 1554 pI am using the function contourLines in R to record the vertices of a contour based on a probability density estimation. Then I test to see whether a point lies inside the contour region. I can do this test easily when there is only one region polygon created from contourLines, but sometimes the there are multiple polygons created. I am trying to come up with a way to determine whether a point lies inside the multiple polygon contour.p  pMy idea so far is to calculate the number of polygons generated and treat each one separately. I was thinking I could use graph theory to determine the number of polygons generated because there will not be a path between points on 2 separate polygons.p  pProbably there is an easier way. Any suggestionsp  pThanks in advance,p  pHSp
Negative 1554 pI need to convert a web page [which has not public access] to PDF or Image [preferably to PNG].p  pWeb page contains set of charts and image. Most of the charts are populated through Ajax calls so there is a delay between page load and chart load. p  pI am looking answer for any of these questions p  p1 I found set of snapshot apis but none of them support accessing my internal page. Since the web page I am trying to export is not public I need to be authenticated. Biggest problem is I cannot send request headers [such as sessionid, cookie or other variables] along with these APIs. It seems they dont support this kind of functionality. p  p2 I am not sure if I can do following Login to my web page with HTTP client, add http headers, send get call and get HTML string. Then use one of the converters to convert it to PDF. What I am not sure is if its possible to get proper PDF from the HTML string I got from http client since resources [css, js and etc] will be missing. I want my pdfimage looks exactly as it on the web site. p  pI really appreciate if you can help. p  pThanks in advance, p  pEDp

Negative 1554 pI have a form on my site that gets submitted to a third party site which basically adds the form data as a record in the third party database. This is implemented with the form action attribute. I have no control over what the third party does after the form is submitted.

I may also want to implement a CAPTCHA.p  pWhat approach can I take to achieve this I thought about having the form submit to the script that houses the form, and collecting all of my POST variables, do the validation, and then maybe redirect to the third party URL, but not quite sure how the third party would receive all the form data if its not longer the form action.

Negative 1554 pIm writing a Windows Forms ClickOnce application that uses the Oracle Instant Client to connect to the DB, because installing the full client on our users machines is not an option. Unfortunately, our users have a mix of 32 and 64 bit machines. While the application itself is AnyCpu, the Oracle libraries are not.p  pRight now, we are distributing two copies of the client, with the only difference being the Oracle DLLs  32bit DLLs for 32bit users, and 64bit DLLs for 64bit users.p  pJust as an experiment, I tried releasing a client with both sets of DLLs, in separate directories, which determines the host OSs bitness at runtime and then loads the DLLs using LoadLibrary. This works, but only sort of. p  pOn 64bit systems, an error box pops up saying, The program cant start because oranls11.dll is missing from your computer. When I click Ok to dismiss the box, the program starts up and runs normally. Adding oranls11.dll to the list of DLLs to load causes emtwoem copies of the message box to pop up, one after the other.p  pSo, is there a better way to load the Oracle Instant Client  If not, is there a way to suppress that message box, at least p

Negative 1554 pThe problem First off, this is a simplified example of my problem, and it is really part of a large framework already programmed by someone else in which i have to adapt my code into.p  pI have 3 functions. Two of the functions function1 and function2 are being called by other parts of the program both asynchronously and synchronously.  My last function function3 runs continuously, like a while loop, and the only thing it does is to fire an event code on each code iteration.  I only want this last function to run whenever one of the two other functions have completed an iterationbeen called. I can not change howwhen they are called, i can only block the execution of the code and unblock it.p  pI am fairly new to c and i have tried solving this using a mutex, but i have had no luck. I can add the code, but it really is just like i explained.p  precodevoid function1   this function is called by other parts of the program some code   void funtion2  this function is also called by other parts of the program some other code   void function3 this function runs continuously, similar to a while loop with a 1ms sleep in it  fireEventfires an event to run some other code  codepre  pSo, function3 runs all the time unless blocked, and i would only like to run the function every time one of the other functions have had one runthrough.

Negative 1554 pI have a relational database table that holds a product lookup.  This table powers multiple systems, only one of which is a Rails app.  In the Rails app, I want to use the product lookup as an ActiveRecord class with instance members with the product code  for example, the key code field is a 4digit alphanumeric.  It would be nice to be able to refer to instances by the code like this  ProductCode.01A3.  I dont want to simply declare them in the Rails code, of course, because the DB is the system of record for multiple systems.  Also, how would Ruby react to a nonexistent product code  If ProductCode.ABCD doesnt exist, does it just silently return a nil, and Id need nil checks everywhere  And then theres the issue of releasing a new ProductCode into production.  Updating the table would require reloading the class instance variables.p  pThoughts  Can this be done  Should this be done  Ive searched for a library but maybe my Googlefu isnt that good.p

I am getting the methods as expected but the contents of the methods arent making sense to me.  As I see it these are not opcodes in particular fffffff is not a java opcode.  What I would like to do is print out all the methods as I have done above and then where I have the opcodes now, print out the java bytecode followed by a few spaces and then the opcode.  For examplep  precodemain     bytecode      .     . codepre  pThe file that I am loading into this program consists of only a main method, a single println statement, and an initialization of a int variable.p  pMy question then is am I doing something wrong, or am I just not interpreting my results correctly  In addition, how can I get the the bytecode  I havent been able to find a way to get it.  I can see it when I use the java bytecode outline plugin for eclipse, but I need to be able to reference it in my program.p  pThanks in advancep

Im using Tomcat as the servlet container.p  pTo clarify, there are several servlets which some serve images, and others html, plus a filter which serves html for various paths which can configured by the user. The 404 status generally comes from the lack of a filter or servlet mapped to the requested path. Hence the errorpage feature is convenient to serve a response for paths that have no filter or servlet to respond to them.p  pSo what I have in web.xml is ignore spaces between  and p  precode... several other mappings above  ltservletmappinggt   ltservletnamegtRestServletltservletnamegt   lturlpatterngtservletrest lturlpatterngt ltservletmappinggt  ltservletmappinggt   ltservletnamegtErrorPageServletltservletnamegt   lturlpatterngtservleterrorPage lturlpatterngt ltservletmappinggt  ...  ltfiltermappinggt   ltThis will serve content and not forward to the filter chain for certain pathsgt   ltfilternamegtMainFilterltfilternamegt   lturlpatterngt lturlpatterngt ltfiltermappinggt  ...  lterrorpagegt   ltPage not foundgt   lterrorcodegt404lterrorcodegt   ltlocationgtservleterrorPage404ltlocationgt lterrorpagegt codepre  pIs it possible to have the error page servlet ignore some requests but serve html in the response for others Or should I use some different method for delivering error pagesp  pTo clarify, what I want is that if someone GETs foo which doesnt exist it goes to the ErrorPageServlet, but for GET servletrestfoobar returns 404 response code it doesnt go to the ErrorPageServlet.p

This doesnt really happen.     port  nextPort        Now that we have the chosen port,     proxy the request.   proxy.proxyRequestreq, res,      host 127.0.0.1,     port port    .listendata.proxyPort   Now we handle WebSocket requests.  Basically, I feed off of the above route  logic and try to route my WebSocket to the  same server regular requests are going to. svr.onupgrade, function req, socket, head     var cookies  parseCookiesreq     var port  false     Make sure there is a Connect.SID,   if cookies[connect.sid]  undefined        Make sure there is a route...     if data.routes[cookies[connect.sid]]  undefined          Assign the appropriate port.       port  data.routes[cookies[connect.sid]].port      else          this has never, ever happened, ive been logging it.         else        this has never, ever happened, ive been logging it.       if port  false        this has never happened...        So now route the WebSocket to the same port    as the regular requests are getting.   svr.proxy.proxyWebSocketRequestreq, socket, head,      host localhost,     port port      codepre  h3Client Side  The Phenomenah3  pSocket connects like sop  precodevar socket  io.connecthttpwhatever8888 codepre  pAfter about 10 seconds on logging on, I get this error back on this listener, which doesnt help much.p  precodesocket.onerror, function data     this is what gets triggered. gt    Firefox cant establish a connection to the server at wswhatever8888socket.io1websocketNnx08nYaZkLY2N479KX0.  codepre  pThe Socket.IO GET request that the browser sends never comes back  it just hangs in pending, even after the error comes back, so it looks like a timeout error. The server never responds.p  h3Server Side  A Workerh3  pThis is how a worker receives a socket request. Pretty simple. All workers have the same code, so you think one of them would get the request and acknowledge it...p  precodeapp.sio.socketio.sockets.onconnection, function socket     works... some of the time all of my workers run this    exact same process.  codepre  h3Summaryh3  pThats a lot of data, and I doubt anyone is willing to confront it, but im totally stumped, dont know where to check next, log next, whatever, to solve it. Ive tried everything I know to see what the problem is, to no avail.p  h2UPDATEh2  pOkay, I am fairly certain that the problem is in this statement on the a hrefhttpsgithub.comnodejitsunodehttpproxynodehttpproxy github homepageap  blockquote   pnodehttpproxy is lt 0.8.x compatible, if youre looking for a    0.10 compatible version please check carontep blockquote  pI am running Node.js v0.10.13, and the phenomena is exactly as some have commented in github issues on this subject it just drops websocket connections randomly.p  pIve tried to implement caronte, the newer fork, but it is not at all documented and I have tried my hardest to piece together their docs in a workable solution, but I cant get it forwarding websockets, my Socket.IO downgrades to polling.p  pAre there any other ideas on how to get this implemented and working nodehttpproxy has 8200 downloads yesterday Sure someone is using a Node build from this year and proxying websockets....p  h2What I am look for exactlyh2  pI want to accomplish a proxy server preferrably Node that proxies to multiple node.js workers, and which routes the requests via sticky sessions based on a browser cookie. This proxy would need to stably support traditional requests as well as web sockets.p  h3Or...h3  pI dont mind accomplishing the above via clustered node workers, if that works. My only real requirement is maintaining sticky sessions based on a cookie in the request header.p  pIf there is a better way to accomplish the above than what I am trying, I am all for it. p

What ends up happening is that the HTML portion of the response gets passed into the JS code as an object with escaped content or gets passed out. Because the contentObject var is an object the regex fails. Forcing contentObject to a string using toString also does not work. Even if it did work, The HTML content is still in an escaped form and conversion back could be problematic given that there may have been escaped entries in the HTML code that may need to stay in HTML format. The final problem here is that the content of the property of TheAlteredContent is being appended to the content and not replacing it, even when the attribute actionreplace is added to the final enrich operation the ESB actually removes it.p  pAnyone know how a better way to do this, or perhaps a way to make the above code workp

Negative 1554 pIm learning data structures from a book.  In the book, they have snippets of pseudocode at the end of the chapter and Im trying to determine the time complexity.  Im having a little bit of difficulty understand some concepts in time complexity.p  pI have two pieces of code that do the same thing, seeing if an element in an array occurs at least 3 times however, one uses recursion and the other uses loops.  I have answers for both can someone tell me whether or not theyre correctp  pFirst way without recursionp  pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecodeboolean findTripleAint[] anArray       if anArray.length lt 2           return false            for int i0 i lt anArray.length i            check if anArray[i] occurs at least three times           by counting how often it occurs in anArray          int count  0          for int j  0 j lt anArray.length j               if anArray[i]  anArray[j]                   count                                  if count gt 3               return true                     return false   codepre  pI thought the first way had a time complexity of On2 in best and worst case scenario because there is no way to avoid the inner for loop.p  pSecond way with recursionp  pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecodepublic static Integer findTripleBint[] an Array      if anArray.length lt 2           return false             use insertion sort to sort anArray      for int i  1 i lt anArray.length i            insert anArray[i]          int j  i1          int element  anArray[i]          while j gt 0 ampamp anArray[j] gt element               anArray[j1]  anArray[j]              j                    anArray[j1]  element             check whether anArray contains three consecutive       elements of the same value      for int i  0 i lt anArray.length2 i           if anArray[i]  anArray[i2]               return new IntegeranArray[i]                      return null    codepre  pI thought the second way had a worst case time complexity of On2 and a best case of On if the array is sorted already and insertion sort can be skipped however I dont know how recursion plays into effect.p
Negative 1554 pIs there a way, and if so, how, to allow only logged in users to download a file using Joomla and PHPp  pHere is the situationp  pWhen users are logged in, they can click the products download link to be brought to a download page. They click download, and are able to download the file. However, these users may be beta testers, or the file may be sensitive, so I need to, somehow, hide the direct link to the file. Be it a PHP file or something that checks if the user is logged in Im already familiar on how to do that and send the file to them. Rather than a link to a .zip file for instance, a link to a .php page that will push the file to themp

This isnt something that we can manually update the .htaccess file with it has to be run from a database lookup of allowed domains.p  pSo, how do I pass along the host  domain thats requesting this file Using SERVER[HTTPREFERER] seems highly unreliable, and Im hoping theres a way the .htaccess  modrewrite can grab it and pass it along with the other variablesp

Negative 1554 pHey guys Ive been playing with the instagram api quite a bit, and ran into a road block. It is very easy to get the comments on a users images and etcetra, but I cannot for the life of my figure out how to find the comments that a user has made on others pictures and videos. Is this tucked into the API somewhere hidden I would expect it to be something likep  precodehttpsapi.instagram.comv1userscommentsaccesstokenACCESSTOKEN codepre  por something but no bueno, anyone know how to do it Looks like the only way is to know the media id of what has been commented on beforehand, but theres no place to figure that out either. So if user v1usersself made a comment on some random image, there is no way to figure it out from the API what they have actually commented on to my knowledgep  pSomething else thats a bummer is that this seems like it is the exact same for things that the user likes as wellp
Negative 1554 pI am doing a project for a contest and in android for a tablet. By wanting to make the user interface more friendly I am using some meters to display speed, torque, temperature and current in a nice way.p  pSo...I inserted the imageviews coresponding to the meters and now its time to set that pins  the place from where the indicator rises its a line on a circle .  I have put my meters images in relative layouts and set parameters for everyone relative to screen resolution. My problem now is that I want to center a image of that pin inside the meter.  I tryed almost everything I can find to get the ablsolute coordinate x and y but no succes. I need something that can give me the exact location of the meter meening X and Y coordinates. To be more specific and I really hope I make myself undearstood I give the next examplep  pI have a screen...lets say 600x600 and I pinned a imageview in the center. Now...I want to get the real coordinates for the imageview on the surface..so I want to get X  300  imageWidth2, Y  300  ImageHeight2 or something like that. So...When I put in a random position from xml layout using just the margin left and margin top parameters I didnt used hardcoded coordinates but now I need to get fixed coordinates beacouse I want to center anoter image inside the parent image. p  pOr another example basicly I want to center a image inside a image and I think to do that I need fixed coordinates of the parents image.p  pThank you for your time, any critcs are much apreciated.p

If codefile1.txtcode has an empty line and codefile2.txtcode also has an empty line in the same place, the result is an empty line in codefile3.txtcode.li ul  pHow can I fill the empty lines in one file with corresponding lines from another filep

Negative 1554 pI have great luck using a combination of Google and usually StackOverflow to locate help with errors in software. But Im wondering if theres a better way. How about tagging all errors with a unique ID p  pThis is just a suggestion, hopefully someone will take this in an even better direction. As a starting point I see errors registered the way we register web sites. Maybe they are web sites. Each error would have a URL. And that URL would have an associated abbreviated version for cases where we want to reference the error but want to save space.p  pThe app developer would be under no obligation to provide anything at the error URL location. That would be optional but nice. Maybe the URLs would all be based on a global domain like wikipedia where anyone can contribute info. My main goal though is just to tag errors with something to make web searched more effective when Im looking for help. p

Negative 1554 pIm loading a fairly large text file into an array using jQuery.

Negative 1554 pI have implemented oneproducermultipleconsumer pattern using Pythons multiprocessing package. The consumers should put the results in a dictionary. The keys of this dictionary are words and the values are  big Scipy sparse matrix. Each consumer adds its value for each word it sees to the main vector for that word in the shared dictionary.p  pI have used Manager.dict to implement this shared dictionary but it is very slow. cpuutilization is about 15 for each process and it is just a little bit better than a single process. Each consumer fetches an item from the shared dictionary, adds a sparse matrix to the value of that item and updates the item in the shared dictionary.p  pIs there any more efficient solution p

Negative 1554 pI encountered some problem using parfor in Matlab.  I run code below inside a function called within a parfor loop.  If I open matlabpool, program crash on saveas function.  If I do not open matlabpool, everything works well.  If I comment both surf call, again everything works well, even with matlabpool open.  I normally saveas with .pdf format but if I saveas with .fig format everything works well. .fig format is the only format that not leads problems.  Of course, I cannot debug parallel loop because parfor with matlabpool open do not allow to step into, therefor without matlabpool open I can see that every variable are good.  Am I missing something I cannot find any known problem using surf within parfor loop. There are too mamy strange issues to try to understand where is the true problem, so I ask if someone had similar problem.

Negative 1554 pI am evaluating the feasibility of automating the entries of bets submitted to a server.

Entries of bets involve clicking the Banker and Sel. columns, and the javascript would store them in some variables, a click on the add to Slip button would cause the bet entry to store into some other variables in another iframe on the right of the screen.   Having entered sets of bets, a click on the Send Bet button would send the bets to the server.p  pThe intended automationp  pThe bets to enter would be available from a java program on the PC, and can be made available to the firefox addon via a file.  The addon reads the file and recursively put the entries inside the variables and call the Add to Slip function. The click on the send bet button can be done manually.p  pThe addon is like a facility automatically fill in fields for a web page.p  pAs I am entirely new to addon and javascript development, is this the correct approach  Or is there any other way to implement this p  pPlease enlighten me, thank you.p

Negative 1554 pSo I am writing an automated theorem prover as a project for a database management class I am taking. I decided to implement it as a CGI program in Perl. I am also going to write a paper to go along with the program which points out the inefficiency of the strategy I am using, which is resolution refutation on a set of clauses using a breadthfirst SOS strategy. p  pWhich is a good segue into my question. You see, the program works fine for small sets of clauses. However, with larger sets I run into a problem. p  pFor example, I just tried to run it on a set of 16 clauses. The number of new clauses that need to be generated using this strategy to get the empty set is rather large for this particular set of clauses, but I am confident that, given enough time, the program can find the empty set.p  pThe thing is, every time I try to load the program with these inputs, the browser automatically stops loading the page somewhere between the 7080th clause generated.p  pIs there a work around that would allow me to load the program in its entirety and get the final results p  pAnyones help on the matter is greatly appreciated. I really dont want to rewrite the program as a noncgi program, but it appears this might be my only option.p

Negative 1554 pIm trying to create a simple turnbased battle in Ruby, but I keep getting stuck when it comes to classes. I tried to do this by starting with basic code and building it up around that.

When I turn codeEnemycode into a class basically modeled exactly after the codePlayercode class, I cant figure out how to make the two objects interact with each other.

The codecode variables are more to show what Im trying to make happen than anything else p  precodeclass Player   attraccessor name hp damage   def initializename, hp, damage     name  name     hp  hp     damage  damage   end    def attack     puts self.name attacks badguy.name     badguy.hp  damage     puts badguy.hp   end end  class Enemy   attraccessor name hp damage   def initializename, hp, damage     name  name     hp  hp     damage  damage   end    def attack     puts self.name attacks goodguy.name     player.hp  damage     puts player.hp   end end    goodguy  Player.newNicehero, 15, 5 badguy  Enemy.newEviljerk, 15, 5  me.attack  codepre  pBasically, what I want to do is make it so that the codePlayercode object can interact with the codeEnemycode object. I cant seem to get this working when I try to make 2 classes interact with each other Also, the variable.name isnt the only thing Ive tried for getting the functions to report those values, but I cant seem to find how to actually reference that object. p  pObviously theres something Im missing about how objects interact or what my code is doing vs what I think it should be doing. I would appreciate any suggestions on getting these two classes to interact or how this should be rewritten so that it functions as intended. p

Negative 1554 pWhen writing an application based on Datomic and Clojure, it seems the peers have unrestricted access to the data.  How do I build a multiuser system where user A cannot access data that is private to user Bp  pI know I can write the queries in Clojure such that only user As private data is returned... but what prevents a malicious user from hacking the binaries to see user Bs private datap  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pIt seems the state of ClojureDatomic applications is in fact lacking in security based on the answer from Thumbnail and the link to John P Hackworths blog.p  pLet me state more clearly the problem I see, because I dont see any solution to this and it is the original problem that prompted this question.  I must be missing something and expressing my ignorance, so please bare with me  Thanks p  pDatomic has a data store, a transactor, and peers.  The peers are on the users computer and run the queries against data from the data store.  My question is how to restrict access to data in the data store.  Since the data store is dumb and in fact just stores the data, Im not sure how to provide access controls.p  pWhen AWS S3 is used as a data store the client a peer has to authenticate before accessing S3, but once it is authenticated doesnt the peer have access to all the data  Limitted only be the queries that it runs, if the user wants to get another users data they can change the code, binary, in the client so that the queries run with a different user name, right  To be clear... isnt the access control just a condition on the query  Or are there user specific connections that the data store recognizes and the data store limits what data is visiblep  pWhat am I missingp  pIn a traditional web framework like Rails, the server side code restricts all access to data and authenticates and authorizes the user.  The user can change the URLs or client side code but the server will not allow access to data unless the user has provided the correct credentials.p  pSince the data store in Datomic is dumb, it seems it lacks the ability to restrict access on a per user basis and the application peer must do this.  I do not want to trust the user to behave and not try to acquire other users information.p  pA simple example is a banking system.  Of course the user will be authenticated... but after that, what prevents them from modifying the client side codebinary to change the data queries to get other users account information from the data storep  pstrongUPDATE  MODELSstrongp  pHere are two possible models that I have of how Datomic and Clojure work... the first one is my current model in my head.p  ul liusers computer runs clientpeer that has the queries and complete access to the data store where user was authenticated before the client started thereby restricting users to those that we have credentials for.li liusers computer has an interface webapp that interacts with a peer that resides on a server.  The queries are on the server and cannot be modified by the user, thereby access controls are under access control themselves by the security of the server running the peer.li ul  pIf the second model is the correct one, then my question is answered the user cannot modify the server code and the server code contains the access controls... therefore, the peers which I thought resided on the users computer actually reside on the application server.p

Negative 1554 pSo I have 3 Divs with hidden Lat Lng inputs, and some ajax pagination to change them out. On the initial load, I have a script that turns each one of the three pairs of Lat Lng inputs into a marker and pushes them into an array. All of this works good.p  pNow, when I update the 3 divs with my script file, and then try to use the provided v3 API method to clear and redraw the markers, I get the same spots on the map. And then, if I tell it to go back to page one results, it does delete the page 1 markers and I get the markers from page 2 on my map. p  pHere is the javascriptp  precodevar map var markers  [] function initialize      var mapOptions           center new google.maps.LatLng37.09024, 96.712891,         zoom 3          map  new google.maps.Mapdocument.getElementByIdmapcanvas,         mapOptions     setRGBmarkers   function setRGBmarkers      markers.pushnew google.maps.Marker         position new google.maps.LatLng             Numberdocument.getElementByIdaddress0Lat.value,             Numberdocument.getElementByIdaddress0Lng.value             ,         map map          removed other markers for brevity   function setAllMapmap      for var i  0 i lt markers.length i          markers[i].setMapmap        function clearMarkers      setAllMapnull   function deleteMarkers      clearMarkers     markers  []   var getPage  function       var a  this      var options           url a.attrhref,         type get           .ajaxoptions.donefunction data          var target  a.parentsdiv.pagedList.attrdatanerdtarget         target.replaceWithdata          deleteMarkers     setRGBmarkers     alertdone     return false   .bodycontent.onclick, .pagedList a, getPage codepre  pSo it successfully goes out and gets the results.

The codeCALayercode will then be scaled as necessary to the size of the codeUIViewcode for display.p  pA normal codeUIViewcode achieves this, provided that it begins life at the fullsize when codedrawRectcode is called and is then vanished down to zerosize.

Negative 1554 pa hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase7docsapijavautilArrays.htmlcodeArrayscodea is sorting the primitive data types using the method codeDualPivotQuicksortcode,  and the complex types separately using mergesort. insertionsort if the input size is small. p  pcodeDualPivotQuicksortcode is using mergesort still on large input sizes, however, it is using dualquicksort on a range of smaller input sizes. p  pWhat I am wondering is why this difference in strategies in sorting the primitive and nonprimitives typesp  pThe performance of the algorithm significantly depends on the input size not the data types.  Invoking codecompareTocode instead of plain magnitude comparison on the primitives , lt,  doesnt  burn extra space in memory and thus doesnt slowdown the absolutetime performance due to memory space that would be considerable during runtime. p  pWhy is codeArrays.sortcode methods using different sort strategies for the primitive data types,  and for the complex data typesp  pTIA. p

Negative 1554 pWhile making everthing emwithem gotos is easy as evidenced by f.ex. IL, I was wondering if it is also possible to eliminate emallem goto statements with higher level expressions and statements  say  using everything thats supported in Java. p  pOr if you like what Im looking for is rewrite rules that will always work, regardless of the way the goto is created.p  pIts mostly intended as a theoretical question, purely as interest not as a goodbad practices.p  pThe obvious solution that Ive thought about is to use something like thisp  precodewhile true      switch state         case [label]  heres where all your gotos will be           state  [label]           continue        default            heres the rest of the program.       codepre  pWhile this will probably work and does fits my formal question, I dont like my solution a single bit. For one, its dead ugly and for two, it basically wraps the goto into a switch that does exactly the same as a goto would do.p  pSo, is there a better solutionp  hr  pstrongUpdate 1strongp  pSince a lot of people seem to think the question is too broad, Im going to elaborate a bit more... the reason I mentioned Java is because Java doesnt have a goto statement. As one of my hobby projects, I was attempting to transform C code into Java, which is proving to be quite challenging partly because of this limitation in Java.p  pThat got me thinking. If you have f.ex. the implementation of the remove method in Open addressing see a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiOpenaddressing relnofollowhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiOpenaddressinga  note 1, its quite convenient to have the goto in the exceptional case, although in this particular case you could rewrite it by introducing a state variable. Note that this is just one example, Ive implemented code generators for continuations, which produce tons and tons of gotos when youre attempting to decompile them.p  pIm also not sure if rewriting in this matter will always eliminate the goto statement and if it is allowed in every case. While Im not looking for a formal proof, some evidence that elimination is possible in this matter would be great.p  pSo about the broadness, I challenge all the people that think there are too many answers or many ways to rewrite a goto to provide an algorithm or an approach to rewriting the general case please, since the only answer I found so far is the one Ive posted.p

Either quite cute or immeasurably perverse, depending on your perspective.emp  pThese things, thus far, have been a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions20945049isajavastringreallyimmutablediscussed ad infinituma on Stack Overflow and elsewhere. I am taking this much for granted in framing this question.p  pWhat Im interested to ask is thisp  h1The questionh1  blockquote   pstrongOnce we discover that a codeStringcode isnt really immutable, what are the implications for how we should write our codestrongp blockquote  pLet me make that more specific in two respects.p  h2JVM Sandboxingh2  pIs it possible for a malicious class to use this trick to break the security of the JVM, and get up to tricks that it shouldnt Are there places in the JDK, for instance, where a codeStringcode is returned from a method, and its safe only on the assumption that it cant be changedp  pHeres a promising startp  precode    String prop  java.version      retrieve a System property as a String     String s  System.getPropertyprop     System.out.printlns      now mess with it     Field field  String.class.getDeclaredFieldvalue       field.setAccessibletrue       char[] value  char[]field.gets       value[0]  x     turns out weve changed not just the String we were     given but the underlying property too     System.out.printlnSystem.getPropertyprop codepre  pWhat this does is to retrieve a system property from the JVM, which comes back as a codeStringcode, and then alter the codeStringcode the consequence is that the underlying property is changed too. Can this be used to wreak havocp  pIm not certain. Its worth noting that you have to have the right permissions to perform reflection. Is the security game already up by that point It allows me here to get round not having permissions to change security properties, but is that to be expected, or is it a problemp  pAre there ways of extending this to do something much worsep  h2Defensive cloningh2  pWere always told that its a good idea to clone arrays and other objects before passing them to methods that might modify them, unless we want them to be modified. Its just good coding practice. Its your own silly fault if you give someone the only copy of your array and it comes back messed with.p  pBut it looks as though the same argument ought to apply to a codeStringcode I have never, ever heard anyone say that we ought to clone a codeStringcode before passing it to a method someone else has written. But how is this any different, if a codeStringcode is as mutable as an arrayp  h3Argument in favour of defensively cloning stringsh3  pIf defensive cloning is all about not really knowing what a method might do to the things we pass it, and if what were passing it is mutable, then we ought to clone it. If the code might be malicious, then it might alter a codeStringcode so whenever its important that the codeStringcode stay unchanged, we should make sure we send a copy rather than the real thing.p  pIt wont wash to say that untrusted code ought to be run under a security manager if we dont trust it not to do bad things to the codeStringcode. If that were true for a codeStringcode, it would be true for an array but no one ever says that cloning of arrays and other objects is only to be done in cases where youre also locking the code down with a security manager.p  h3Argument against defensively cloning stringsh3  pAn array might get modified just by sloppy coding in other words, it might get modified unintentionally. But no one alters a codeStringcode unintentionally it can be done only with sneaky tricks that mean the programmer was trying to break immutability.p  pThat makes the two cases different. We really shouldnt be passing an array, even a clone of it, to code that we dont trust on any level. You dont download a library from somewhere dodgy and then think youre OK because you cloned your array. You clone defensively because you think the programmer might be making mistakes or making different assumptions from you about whats allowable with the data youre sending. If youre worried that the code might be modifying codeStringcodes behind your back, you really shouldnt be running the code at all. All you achieve by cloning a codeStringcode is performance overhead.p  h1The answerh1  pHow should we think about this Can JVM sandboxing be broken using these tricks And should we code defensively in the light of the mutability of a codeStringcode, or is this all a red herringp

Every perl dev knows that message.

And added the new module pathes to the list LibraryPerl5.18AppendToPath. Worked well. But when I installed a module  not available as 5.18 in Macports  with cpan, I got trouble. The module was compiled with 5.16 of course, see above and was not accepted as other path in the AppendToPath file. Dynaloader mismatch.p  pI do not know, where the INC list is altered at runtime. In earlier Mac OS 10 versions, the new INC included same version module versions. I.e. an active perl 5.14 included also 5.14 modules, 5.12 included 5.12 pathes a.s.o. Why does perl 5.16 on Yosemite include 5.18 module pathes p  hr  pTo add some confusion after my post  When I try a print V in program code, I get 5.18.  That means, you dont get what you meant to get. May be my shebang usrbinperl starts 5.18 and not 5.16.p

Performance isnt a massive issue as there wont be a huge amount of employees in the database 1000p  pThe database design that I have come up with so far has been normalized to an extent so employee data has been split in to separate tables where multiple data items need to stored for each employee, but there are a lot of fields which are primary key dependant so this has resulted in the main employee information table having around 50 columns. p  pIs this too many and should I try to group similar items into their own table e.g a table for contact information, a table for personal information, or is it better to leave it as isp
Negative 1554 pIm running a web application on a Tomcat server. This application relies on the Spring framework and CXF JAXRS 2.7.11 is used to facilitate the development of REST web services.p  pI have noticed that each time a web client sends an HTTP request with relatively long  200 chars header field values, the serverside generated codeorg.apache.cxf.message.Messagecode object shows an empty value for these headers.p  pFor instance, if the HTTP request sent by the client includes the following headers p  precodeRegularHeader  regularheadervalue LongHeader  longheadervalue codepre  pThe associated Message object lets appear the following when inspected p  precodeRegularHeader[regularheadervalue] LongHeader[] codepre  pI have firstly checked the codemaxHttpHeaderSizecode parameter of Tomcat but it is set to 8192 bytes by default, which is certainly larger than the header values producing this strange behavior. On second thought, it could rather be related to the CXF JAXRS framework.p  pSo the question isp  pIs there a way to check if CXF JAXRS defines a limit on header value length of parsed HTTP headersp

Negative 1554 pI am migrating eclipse 3.x application to eclipse 4.4.1 using compat layer.  In the application there are multiple perspectives and there are seprate fragement.xmi for each perspective. Everything is working fine. p  pBut we have requirement that any view can open in any perspective. So for that i have to define placeholders in fragment.xmi for each perspective. p  pMy question is how one plugin fragment.xmi can access views defined in other plugins fragement.xmi or i have to define duplicate views as shared elements in all fragement.xmip  pI am actually confused whether i should define all perspectives in ApplicationModel or i should create seprate fragement.xmi for each perspectivep

Negative 1554 pIm working on a heap profiler for Linux, called a hrefhttpmilianw.deblogheaptrackaheapmemoryprofilerforlinuxheaptracka. Currently, I rely on codeLDPRELOADcode to overload various deallocation functions, and that works extremely well.p  pNow I would like to extend the tool to allow runtime attaching to an existing process, which was started without codeLDPRELOADcodeing my tool. I can codedlopencode my library via GDB just fine, but that wont overwrite codemalloccode etc. I think, this is because at that point the linker already resolved the position dependent code of the already running process  correctp  pSo what do I do instead to overload codemalloccode and friendsp  pI am not proficient with assembler code. From what Ive read so far, I guess Ill somehow have to patch codemalloccode and the other functions, such that they first call back to my trace function and then continue with their actual implementation Is that correct How do I do thatp  pI hope there are existing tools out there, or that I can leverage GDBptrace for that. p  pThanksp
Negative 1554 pstrongTrigger Warningstrong I am a former NHibernate user making the switch over to EF.p  pJust ran into my first major disappointment with Entity Framework 6. In a hrefhttpsgist.github.comNotMyselfb9e782143cf6f7ca5e56 relnofollowthis abstract base classa, I have the basic functionality for an account. p  pAn account has a collection of transactions. To determine the available balance of an account, I simply subtract the total expenses and non released encumbrances from the total deposits. This is pure business logic related to all types of accounts.p  pTo get total amounts, I have a handful of properties that filter the accounts transactions by type and sums the amount on the transactions. See a hrefhttpsgist.github.comNotMyselfb9e782143cf6f7ca5e56fileaccountcsL18 relnofollowTotalDepositAmounta for an example of a couple ways I tried to do this.p  pI am using Lazy Loading in EF and what I expected EF to do was issue a query to the database to get the summed value of the deposit transactions. Instead, EF fetches ALL the transactions for the account and loads them into memory and then linq filters them. WTF.p  pI only found this issue because I was doing some performance testing in my sample application and pumped 30k transactions a totally possible amount into an account. Attempting to ToString my account basically crashes the app now...p  pAfter digging around, I discovered that the only way to query a navigation property is to do it when you fetch the parent or have access to the dbcontext inside your entity.. so the property would look something like this..p  precodepublic decimal TotalDepositAmount      get              return context.Entrythis.ReferenceTransactions.Query             .OfTypeltDepositgt.Sumd gt d.Amount       codepre  pBut of course, I dont have access to the context inside my entity and having it would completely pollute the purity of my entities...p  pSo, EF experts. What am I missing. How can I accomplish my goal here of having pure domain entities. What work arounds or patterns can I usep
Negative 1554 pIn the Windows, the native Notepad program has a find form.

I can give four single values as coordinates to the vincenty formula or a list or a string and it will work. But the only way I can apply the formula to several entries is using lists.p  hr  pOkay, one final edit ... I could not exactly do what you have suggested. Instead, I converted the pandas series to lists and looped through the lists with the formula. I guess that this is the least efficient way, but that is what I can do with my programming skills and performance does not really matter in my case. However, I appreciate your suggestions itertools, array broadcasting and I will keep them in mind for other applications. Thank you very muchp

I show the sequence through strongdoClickstrong but remove the actionlisteners beforehand and add it afterwards. p  pThe problem is the buttons wont unpress or unarm until all other buttons have been pressed. Ive tried using thread.sleep to put a delay between each if...else statements yet it only stays pressed for longer. Ive tried updating the gui through repaint, revalidate, updateUI within the try... catch of the thread.sleep but that didnt work either.p  pIve realized this issue is mainly cosmetic because when I tried implementing setPressed or setArmed it said it wasnt being pressed but it looked pressed.p  pHere is the code snippet in its most simplest form without thread.sleep or my previous attempts in comments.p  precodepublic void sequence2 This is where the issue happens. The buttons wont unpress until every button has been pressed.       level.setText                                         Level 2 Level indicator      Green.removeActionListenerListener     Red.removeActionListenerListener     Yellow.removeActionListenerListener     Blue.removeActionListenerListener      ifsequence1  1                     Green.doClick300 Programmatically clicks the button          else ifsequence1  2              Red.doClick300          else ifsequence1  3              Yellow.doClick300          else ifsequence1  4              Blue.doClick300           ifsequence2  1              Green.doClick300          else ifsequence2  2              Red.doClick300          else ifsequence2  3              Yellow.doClick300          else ifsequence2  4              Blue.doClick300           Green.addActionListenerListener     Red.addActionListenerListener     Yellow.addActionListenerListener     Blue.addActionListenerListener   codepre  pIm very new to java so Im not skilled in multithreading or working on the Event  Dispatch Thread for that manner.

Negative 1554 pI am trying to build an app with a table view and a tab view.  I want each item in the table to open a tab view when clicked.  For clarity, here is a pic of my storyboardp  pa hrefhttpi.imgur.comObFvvuG.png relnofollowhttpi.imgur.comObFvvuG.pngap  pI have the first tab scene embed in a navigation controller.

Can someone offer me some advice on how to fix thisp  pSorry for the links to the images rather then embeded images.  You need 10 reputation to add imagesp
Negative 1554 pId like to increase parallelism of build using MSBuild in the following scenariop  pThere are three C projects targets. The first is a static library called codeAcode, the second is a dynamic library called codeBcode which depends on codeAcode, and the third is an executable codeCcode that depends on codeBcode. All of the projects contain simple source code and no header generation or other shenanigans.p  pThere is nothing in this configuration that should preclude all of the translation units from being compiled in parallel as the only real dependencies are at link time. However, the standard way of setting up references and dependencies in MSBuild forces all of codeAcode to build before it will even start building anything in codeBcode, and so on. This unnecessarily serializes some of the build process.p  pThe projects and the general solution need to remain approachable to the average developer meaning that maintaining the projects and build setup should be achievable entirely in the Visual Studio UI new libraries and executables may depend on preexisting property sheets but it should not be required to edit new projects .vcxproj files by hand, nor to manually write MSBuild XML files.p  pMy current thought is to move all the code from codeBcode and codeCcode into separate static libraries, called codeBcode and codeCcode. Then codeBcode would depend on both codeAcode and codeBcode, allowing them to compile in parallel. Likewise, as codeCcode ultimately depends on codeAcode, codeBcode, and codeCcode those can all compile in parallel. The only remaining serial processes would be the linker steps, as expected. That is a little more cumbersome and nonidiomatic than Id like though it wouldnt be the end of the world.p  pId really like to just be able to make dependencies for a projects link step that dont also act as dependencies for the projects compile step. In most other build systems Im familiar with this is trivial if not implicit. Is it possible in MSBuild for C projects given the Visual Studio easeofuse requirement if so, howp

Debugging the code reveals that the crash happens exactly when codereturncode is called.p  pAdding to the weirdness is that, found by trial and error, a simple cure for the crash is not to return a pointer from the codefcode function, but supply the function with a double pointerp  precode WORKING CODE EXAMPLE  Modify the function to use a double pointer void fchar c       Allocate some memory 1024 is merely an example     c  malloc1024    Calling function void mainf      char c     fampc      Do some stuff here     freec  codepre  pThe actual code is part of a GTK program and runs inside the main loop of GLib.

Negative 1554 pI saw many services, mainly map services like GMaps or MapQuest, that requires users registers previously to obtain an codeappKeycode. Later, on each request the user must attach the codeappKeycode like codehttpserverserviceappKeysdf7dfj34code.p  pI understand this kind of appKeys are insecure and are mainly usefull to know the useage of your service. Anyone can see your codeappKeycode and make use on its own app.p  pI saw other services that, on registration proces, requires you put the domain where you will execute your code. This way they can check if the domain from which the request is made corresponds to the appKey generated for that domain.p  pMy questions arep  ul liIs this kind of control secureli liCan I ensure the user is really the one who register.li liIf the domainappKey options is possible, how can implement it Im using JavaSpring.li ul  pI must clarify my intention is users can requests data via appKey using JavaScriptAJAX.p  pThanks.p

Negative 1554 pI have a web application with a websocket connection, and I cannot seem to get the connection to work. It keeps giving me the error access denied java.util.PropertyPermission org.glassfish.tyrus.client.sharedContainer read on the client side log, ad on the server side I get Warning   StandardWrapperValve[default] Servlet.service for servlet default threw exception java.io.IOException Connection reset by peerp  pIm not sure whether this is because of a problem with my code, or with the libraries and classes I used to support that code. When I change the clients target address, it gives the same error but I dont get any errors on the server end. Im not sure if this is because Ive incorrectly configured the connection protocol, and so its hitting the server app but not the websocket port, or if its because of the combination of technologies Im using for the server and the client. Im trying to use the plain JSR 356 for both, but that doesnt quite work for the client. I found out somewhere that the JSR client isnt properly done, but that its supposed to work if you include the Tyrus stand alone libraries in your project, even if you dont actually change your code to use any classes from them. If I leave out the Tyrus library, then I get Could not find an implementation class from my client instead. You can view the source code for my client a hrefhttpgithub.comAgoraProjectJAgoraLib relnofollowherea and for my server a hrefhttpgithub.comAgoraProjectJAgoraWebSocketServer relnofollowherea. Ive gotten the same errors on the client side both when using netbeans with glassfish, and also when deployed to a remote tomcat server. For the browser, Ive been using Firefox under an Xubuntu operating system.p  pSo is this a problem of me just not getting the two aimed at the right places to talk to each other, or am I using the wrong libraries, or using them in the wrong way, or whatp

It also makes two bars, one for the assessment score and one for RTI number.

Negative 1554 pI am working on project with fairly complex requirements for a task queue. We have a backend worker server that processes jobs out of a queue. These jobs are put into a queue by a front end server as a response to certain events that take place. Fairly standard. However, each of these jobs is also dependent on a file that is uploaded asynchronously by the client who sent the initial event to the front end server. That file is sent to a third upload server which handles streaming the file into a persistent store.p  pIf the backend processing server is handed a task before the file upload is complete, the task will fail, or possible work with just part of the uploaded file, which is definitely undesirable. p  pRight now we have the system working with timed retry and back off on the part of the task queue. The result is that every job fails a few times until the file is uploaded and then executes successfully.p  pMy idea for a solution is to use some sort of task queue that can handle modifications to the state of tasks. The front end server could create a task, placing it on deck, and the upload server could modify that task using its ID, modifying it in such a way that it would be pushed out to a backend worker server. This way, all state would be kept in the queuing service, allowing the other servers to remain stateless.p  pAre there any existing systems with this functionality Ive looked and havent had much luck. If not I am hoping to build off an existing system that offers as similar of a functionality as is possible. What tools would be useful in creating such a queueing system It seems that the problem of multiple inputs for tasks in a queue would be a fairly general one.p

Negative 1554 pI have a codedirected acyclic graphcode whose vertices have at most code2code incoming edges. Vertices are divided into levels, that are calculated this way level of a vertex with no incoming edges is code0code, level of a vertex codevcode not belonging to level code0code can be calculated as codemax  levelu  1 code, for each codeedge u, vcode belonging to the graph.p  pI need to reshape the graph so that every level has no more than a set number codekcode of vertices width. In most cases codekcode  has to be code1024code.p  pIn this a hrefhttpi.imgur.comfiXUhhm.png relnofollow titleexampleexample imagea the graph has to be shaped for it to have maximum level width code2code. The red node is moved from level code0code to level code1code, causing level code1code width to become code3code, so another upwards movement is required. p  pRight now Im calculating the levels for each node in the graph using a slight modification of codeBellmanFord algorithmcode  I add a source node connected to all the level code0code nodes that are known and run the algorithm picking the maximum distance instead of the minimum distance.p  pTo reshape the graph Im partitioning the vertices by level, and starting from the level code0code, Im moving the exceeding vertices upwards. After each move I need to update the level partitioning, since all the subgraph connected to the moved vertex is moved up consequently. This approach was proven to be inefficient for the graphs Im working on, since I need to move elements up repeatedly, resulting in multiple runs of BellmanFord causing a bottleneck.p  pHeres the code of my reshaping functionp  precodevoid GraphReshapeint width  Width is the maximum width of any level        Run BellmanFord to create the level partitioning in mlevels     Levelize       int currentLevel  0      do              int levelWidth  mlevels[currentLevel].size          int widthDifference  levelWidth  width          if widthDifference gt 0                       for int i  0 i lt widthDifference i                                Get the first vertex in the current level to move it up                 Vertex v  mlevels[currentLevel].front                         Add a vertex f to the graph, between v and all the vertices                  directly connected to v resulting in v moving 1 level higher                 Vertex f  boostaddvertexmgraph                  auto inEdges  boostinedgesv, mgraph                  for auto it  inEdges.first it  inEdges.second it                                      Vertex s  boostsourceit, mgraph                     boostaddedges, f, mgraph                                   boostaddedgef, v, mgraph                             Run BellmanFord again to update the level partitioning             Levelize                  while currentLevel lt mlevels.size   codepre  pIs there some clever approach to speed things upp

Negative 1554 pI have a system which can fail in several ways. I am currently piping all my watching through a single check which can output a file of my liking which can then be connected to externally. I am currently using an XML file with a status tag which is OK, if all is well.p  pI was trying to use Pingdoms custom monitoring to watch this file which is ok, as long as I want to know that everything is ok.p  pMy problem is that when something goes wrong, and the XML file contains Out of memory in the status tag, Pingdom only reports that the check went wrong. It does not allow for returning the actual status which can then be sent out through the alert system.p  pI need to be able to send out these status messages when my system fails, so the receiver of the alert actually knows what is wrong, and not just that something is wrong.p  pDoes anyone know if this is possible through Pingdom, or do I need to use another monitoring system to allow for this kind of message p
Negative 1554 pI am creating a web store in SilverStripe from scratch without using a shop module. I am having trouble creating the shopping cart. p  pIf I were to make a web store without any CMS system I would create 3 tables. A codeUsercode table, a codeProductcode table and an codeOrdercode table. p  pIn the codeOrdercode table there would be stored an codeIDcode for the order, a codeUserIDcode that links to a user, a codeProductIDcode that links to a product and a codeQuantitycode. p  pBecause I am using SilverStripe I cant directly do that. I can create tables like that but because it isnt the purpose of creating and running queries that is not the way to do it. p  pHow do I do this correctly using SilverStripep  pI am aware of various opensource shopping modules for SilverStripe, but I found them confusing and I have no idea how they link to each other. p

Negative 1554 pI imagine this is the kind of question that only someone who has implemented this totally wrong before will be able to answer, so Im crossing my fingers you guys are out there.p  pIn a nutshell, I have a model that iterates over a series of steps. I want to use an activity model there to track when weve advanced from step 1 to step 2, rewound from step 2 back to step one, completed all steps, etc. I also have a user model which will receive notifications based on site activity.p  pWhat I cant figure out is whether those two types of activity should be separate models or not. If they were separate, I would have a StepActivity model that expects an ID corresponding to a particular group of steps, and a separate UserActivity model that expects a userid. In contrast, if they were together, I would build an activity stream with an objectid and subjectid, store the group of steps as the subject, and then select all activities with that subject.p  pIm seeing potential down and up sides to both of these routes, but my main concern is that the step activity is for recordkeeping purposes, and the user activity is more for informative activity stream purposes. Lumping them together feels wrong, but at the same time, separating them out feels redundant. Could definitely use a second opinion here...p

Negative 1554 pIm migrating a website made in Asp classic to work correctly on IE11. Currently the default browser used on the company is IE8.p  pWhen I do access this website the initial page loads in the background and then call a showModalDialog that presents a window with a few links.

Negative 1554 pHello Ive been learning jQuery for a little while now and am trying to sharpen my skills by creating a responsive website. I added a navigation bar, then a big slider, and below it is the main content of the website. Right now, jQuery as both the menu background and the main background are black adds a class to the navigation bar in order to turn it white as soon as you scroll past the slider which has a height of 550px, so it will be easier to read.p  pHeres the thing I want jQuery to add that class depending on the width of the window. If its stronglessstrong than 600px wide, I want the class to be added automatically. Otherwise, I want jQuery to add it as soon as you scroll past the slider since I hide it when the window is less than 600px wide. My code is below, and it works just fine if I resize the window and then refresh the page, but I want it to add the class dynamically. Do you think it is possiblep  pI hope I made myself clear English is not my first language. Let me know if you need me to explain things better Thank you in advance. p  precodeif window.width gt 599       window.scrollfunction          if window.scrollTop gt 550  if you scroll past the slider             main nav.addClasswhitemenu          else              main nav.removeClasswhitemenu so it turns black again                else       add it automatically the slider is hidden     main nav.addClasswhitemenu  codepre

Negative 1554 pI am building a webapplication with PHP frontend and Java as a backend to retrieve information from the customized Lucene index.p  pOn the PHP, I use exec to run the JAR that retrieve results from Java lucene index that prints out only metdata results of the documents and we are dealing with about 300 lines of String or results. I figured the more the results, the slower the speed of search from PHP. It took roughly 45 secs to retrieve 300 line of results but in Javausing Eclipse IDE, only 0.3 sec or lesser is required to retrieve the same results using the same method. I tried running JAR directly from commandline and the search speed is in the middlep  pSo I put timer in the Java to debug the problem and found that what seems to be slowing down is the use of System.out.println. Without printing out the search results, the search speed in PHP is as fast as in Java IDE. p  pIs there a good way to capture the output of Java methods from PHP without compromising the speed I want my search engine to be scaleable and handle more results. btw, I am developing on Windows 7.p

Negative 1554 pI am turning around in stackoverflow without finding an answer to my question. I have used expressJS fur several days in order to make an access webpage that returns first an interstitial and then a webpage depending on several informations I can get from the requester IP and so on.p  pMy first idea for the interstitial was to use this piece of codep  precodevar interstitial  functionreq, res, next      res.renderinterstitial     next   router.get, interstitial, nextPage codepre  psetting a timeout on the next nextPage callback function of router.get.p  pHowever it looks that I could not do that. I had an error Error Cant set headers after they are sent.. I suppose this is due to the fact that res.render already give a response to the request and in the philosophy of express, the next function is passing the req, res args for another reply to another function that possibly could do it. Am I rightp  pIn that case, is there a way to give several answer, with timeout to one request a res.render, and after that in the next callback a rest.send.... Or is this mandatory to force client to ask a request to give back another response using js on the client side for instance, or timers on client side, or maybe discussing with client script using socket.io.p  pThanksp

Negative 1554 pI have an app that predicts the winner of a soccer game, and I am trying to change the UI. I made the screen where you enter the Data into a Dialog activity, and made the History activity the main activity. The Dialog to enter the data is called upon press of a button in the History activity.p  pIs there any way to update the recyclerView with the users history after the dialog is terminated.p  pIn another words, is there a way to add an entry to cardview in a recyclerview, with both new and old data in an sqlite database, when the user enters data into a Dialog Activityp  pIn my code, the button to start the dialog that gets the users input is called PLUSBUTTON in my code. When the user clicks enter on the Dialog, their data is added to an SQLite database. The SQLite database is read on the creation of the Main Activity only, so obviously something will needed to be added in that aspect.p  pHistory Activity Datap  precodepackage

Negative 1554 pIm writing a google chrome extension that gives the user a new word everyday. This word appears in the popup and is inserted into an array so they can study them later. In my background.js I have the classic setInterval, like belowp  precodesetIntervalfunction  ...code to get new word and push to array , 123600000 codepre  pThe problem however is that this functions works on every tab open So I left it for a day with 10 tabs open and I had 10 new words.

Negative 1554 pIm currently building a Twitter app and Im facing a problem since two months for a specific function.p  pThis is what I wish to do display the tweets from the users Twitter lists and refresh them with new tweets. Twitter offers stream API to get new tweets instantly. However, to get the lists tweets, the Twitter API allows me only to get them through a REST API and not a stream API. p  pMy idea is then to make regular REST API calls, compare the new tweets, and then to add each new tweet to the interface like if it was a real stream.p  pFor doing this, Ive done the function below to compare an array of objects. Im checking each tweet ID to compare them.Tests have been written and they all pass. p  pUnfortunately, my app behaves akwardly and keeps adding tweets even though they are no differences between the current and the incoming ones.  So, perhaps the problem comes from somewhere else, but I think it is not the place here to submit pages of code for getting you to help me to fix my problem. But if you are interested, Im okay to share the code.p  pSo heres my question Am I doing things right, or do you see a better solution for what I want to dop  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodejs langjs prettyprintoverridecode   Return the difference between the current messages in the array and the incoming   param  Array incoming Array of incoming tweets   return Array current  Array of current tweets   MessagesDisplay.prototype.compareCurrentListWithIncoming  functionincoming, current      Return the elements not present in the array     Array.prototype.diff  functiona          return this.filterfunctionarray              var exist  false             for var i  0 i lt a.length i                  ifarray.idstr  a[i].idstr                     exist  true                                           ifexist                 return array                                var messagesToAdd  []           messagesToAdd  incoming.diffcurrent      return          messagesToAdd messagesToAdd,      codepre div div p

Negative 1554 pHow do I listen for touch move events in the new Microsoft Edge browser in Windows 10p  pThe Edge browser does not implement JavaScript touchstart, touchend, and touchmove events. Instead, it uses a new specification to implement pointerdown, pointerup, and pointermove events, so I listen for those. If I tap the screen I see pointerdown and pointerup events generated, as expected. But if I touch the screen, drag my finger, and break contact with the screen, then I only get a pointerdown event. I was expecting pointerdown, followed by a bunch of pointermoves, and finally a pointerup. The same thing happens in Internet Explorer 11 as well. How do I get the missing pointermove and pointerup eventsp  pNote that if I let Edge fall back to using mousedown, mouseup, and mousemove events for touch then dragging my finger will generate a mousedown event, but no mousemoves or mouseup.p

Negative 1554 pI need to format incomplete date only to month precision. My first guess was to apply pattern MMMM yyyy to it. This works fine for many locales English, German, ..., but gives ugly result for languages with flexion, e.g. Russian.
