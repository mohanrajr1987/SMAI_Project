Negative 41325 pIve an image gallery, that displays images in a 5X5 matrix. Each image has a codeonmouseovercode function where in a hidden div is displayed with some details about the image and the div with the details gets hidden using codeonmouseoutcode. The div that contains the details about the image may contain clickable links and hence I am displaying the div just under the cursor position. p  pThe problem I am facing is with the images in the 5th column. If the div that contains the details has more content, it creates a horizontal scroll bar and the details get cut off.  How do I always show the details div inside the view port just under the cursorp  pTheres not much to it but heres the codep  precodefunction eventRollOverid       var did  imgid     document.getElementByIddid.style.display  function eventRollOutid      var did  imgid     document.getElementByIddid.style.displaynone  codepre  pMany Thanks  p

Negative 41325 pWe have an Excel workbook with a number of ActiveX controls, running in Excel 2003 on Windows XP.  When connecting using Remote Desktop, the ActiveX controls change font, sometimes font size, and sometimes orientation in the case of a spinner control.  This happens on first connection and also as the workbook is used  some of the controls then enlarge in size, often overlapping other controls and part of the workbook.p  pI read somewhere this may be caused by improper connection management not closing them leading to increasing memory usage are there other reasons why the display is so different over Remote Desktop and are there workarounds  the properties of each control usually remain the same, so forceresizing them doesnt always have an effectp

Negative 41325 pI am using standard JPA transaction manager for my JPA transactions. However, now I want to add some JDBC entities which will share the same datasource. How can I make the JDBC operations transactional with spring transaction Do I need to switch to JTA transaction managers Is it possible to use both JPA amp JDBC transactional service with same datasource Even better, is it possible to mix these two transactionsp  pUPDATE  Espen p  pI have a dao extended from SimpleJdbcDaoSupport which uses getSimpleJDBCTemplate.update to insert a database row. When a RuntimeException is thrown from the service code, the transaction never rolls back when using JPATransactionManager. It does rollback when using DatasourceTransactionManager. I tried to debug the JPATransactionManager and seems that it never performs rollback on underlying JDBCConnectionI guess due to the fact that the datasource is not necessarily has to be JDBC for JPA.

Negative 41325 pIm building a simple live chat into a web application running on Django, but one thing Im confused about is how I should store the messages between users. p  pThe chat will support multiple users, and a chat session is composed of users connected to one user that is the host. The application is a sort of online document collaboration thing, so user X has a document, and users Y and Z would connect to user X to talk about the document, and that would be one chat session.p  pIf user Y disconnected for five minutes, and then signed back in and reconnected to user X, he should not get any of the messages shared between users X and Z while he was away.p  pif users X, Y, and Z can have a chat session about user Xs document, then users X and Y can connect to a simultaneous, but separate discussion about user Zs document.p  pHow should I handle this Should I keep each message in the database Each message would have an owner user and a target user the host, and a separate table would be used to connect users with messages which messages are visible to what users.p  pOr should I store each session as an HTML file on the server, which messages get appended top  pThe problem is, I cant just send messages directly between clients. They have to be sent to the server in a POST request, and then each client has to periodically check for the messages in a GET request. Except I cant just have each message cleared after a client fetches it, because there could be multiple clients. How should I set this up Any suggestionsp

Negative 41325 pI started learning Iphone development. As im reading about the cocoa development framework, few principal notions came around and with it a little bit of confusion. I want to make sure I understand things right and to get a little clarification p  pDelegate  basically the strategy design pattern.

There are the SetAction and SetTarget methods for UI objects. As I understand, if I connect a method using IB by streching a line betweeen the UI object to the file owner, the method is the action and the file owner is the target. Does it mean that all the UI methods events have to be directed to the same targer  As I only have SetTarget method which doesnt accept a Selector or anything similar as another argument. The same question remains regarding actions. How can I stretch lines between many methods to one file owner if there is only one action As the function SetAction imply at a time. Im looking to understand how this mechanism works.p  pThanksp

Negative 41325 pThere are plenty of questions and information on setting up asp.net membership, role providers and the like. Whether or not you should use the built in platform provided by microsoft, or role extend the base classes and role your own.p  pI have decided to extend the default providers and implement my own membership and role providers. Now my question, is specifically around role authentication.p  pTraditionally, you would create roles maybe like Manager, Administrator, Employee, Super User or whatever you have. But what wouldshould you do with respect to permissions which I consider to be a finer grain of control Let me elaborate....p  pWithin my asp.net mvc site I have different areas like administration, management, messaging, reporting etc. I would crate roles for each of these like Administrator, Manager, Reporter etc. Without the appropriate role, you cant gain access to that area of the site. So I would lock down the entire controllers with this at the class level.p  pBut now take one area as an example messaging, and say I wanted to have finer grain permissions for CRUD create a message, viewread messages, edit messages, delete messages etc.p  pFinally my question. How would it be best to implement this finer grain of control One approach I see not sure if it is a good one, is to just create asp.net membership roles for everything. So I might have....p  pMessenger broad level role, CreateMessage, ReadMessage, EditMessage, DeleteMessage.p  pOn one hand I would like some users to be able to readview messages. But not necessarily create or delete them. Individual controller actions could have the specific roles applied.p  pDo you see any problems with this approach Do you have a better ideap  pstrongSolution So Farstrongp  pI have decided to create my own schema and implement custom membership and role providers.

Negative 41325 pA long time ago I remember reading that you should always use the smallest possible type to store your data, but nearly every piece of code I read doesnt do this. They often use 32 bit integers all over the place.p  pIve heard the rationale that a 32 bit value is fetched as fast as an 8 bit value, but processors have some way of fetching several smaller values at once.. Rightp  pSo if I use 4 bytes instead of 4 integers, shouldnt the compiler be able to optimize this so the 4 bytes is fetchedstored in a single 32 bit registerp  pOr is all of this really just premature optimization and the potential performance gain is negligiblep

Negative 41325 pI just recently switched to Komodo for Python programming, and Im loving it so far.  I love how if I type a function name, followed by the openparen codecode, it opens the calltipdocstring.  I also love how if I type a module name, followed by code.code, it opens a list of available functions.  My question is, is it possible to get the calltipdocstring to popup when I have the function list up In other words, I want to be able to see what each function does the docstring before I insert it and open the argument list with the codecode.  The reason is that I find myself needing a function, and scrolling through the function list and inserting functions that look relevant to bring up the docstring to see if thats the exact one I want, and then if its not, deleting it and trying again by bringing back up the function list.  This functionality is present in Eclipse, and Im trying to mimic it.p  pSorry if that was convoluted, and thanks in advance for any help.p

Negative 41325 pstrongBackground Informationstrongp  pI have a distributed processing application that does data analysis.  It is designed to do parallel processing of many sets of data updated in real time.  As part of the design, the analysis has been broken up into analytic nodes.  Each node takes source data and processes it to create other data, which can then in turn be used by other nodes.  To do our current full set of analysis on one data set requires about 200 nodes.p  pIn the current design, each node runs with its own thread.  Now, most of the time these threads are asleep.  They wake up each in turn like a waterfall whenever data is updated, and then they go back to sleep.  The application is currently in production running on 40 sets of data, each requiring 200 nodes, using 8000 threads.  When there is no data coming in, there is no load on the server.  When the data comes in at its busiest times, the server spikes to about 25 CPU.  This is all within the design and production parameters of the project.p  pNow for the next step, we are scaling the 40 sets of data to 200.  Each set requires 200 nodes which means a total of 40000 nodes, which is 40000 threads.  This exceeds the max PID of our server, so I requested that our server admins increase the cap.  They did it, and the application works, but they gave me some pushback about the number of threads.  Im not denying that the number of threads is unusual, but it is expected and warranted by this stage of our design.p  pI am planning some small tweaks to the design to separate the thread from the node.  This would allow us to configure one thread to run multiple nodes, and reduce our thread count.  For data sets that do not get updated frequently, there will be very little performance effect of having one thread execute the data updates in every node.  For data sets that are updated hundreds of times per second, we can configure each node to run on its own thread.  In fact, I dont doubt that this design change will be made  its only a matter of when.  In the meantime, Id like as much information as I can about the consequences of using this design.p  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pWhat are the costs of running with over 40,000 threads on one machine  How much performance am I losing by having the JVM  Linux OS manage this many threads  Please remember that they are all configured properly to sleep when there is no work.  So, Im just talking about extra overhead and problems caused by the sheer number of threads.p  pemPlease note  I know that I can reduce the number of threads, and I know that its a good idea to make this design change.  Ill do it as soon as I can, but it has to be balanced against other work and design considerations.  Im asking this question to gather information in order to make a good decision.  Your thoughts and comments to this nature are much appreciated.emp

When the answer from the webservice returns, at first a thread is bound for processing the business layer service and then another for finishing the Page rendering. But that sounds like a lot of overhead  both in coding and maybe even at runtime.p  pAnother solution would be a modification of the first one  namely, returning an unfinished response to the client once we trigger the external webservice call and processing the result of it not in the context of a Request but simply inside the application. Then, of course, the client would have to poll the server for the result which should have been saved somewhere.

Negative 41325 pafter reading the blue book Eric Evans Domain Driven Design and starting applying the DDD concepts in a simple blog like application I have the following question, how do you model a local identity of an entity inside an aggregate rootp  pLets say for the sake of simplicity, I have a simple blog model that has the following entities and scenarios A registered user can publish a post, a post can have one or more tags associated and a registered or unregistered user can publish a comment on a post.p  pIn this scenario, the entities are User, Post, and Comment, the aggregate roots are User na Post being comment an aggregate inside Post aggregate root.p  pSo since the comment entity has a local identity inside Post how do I model its local identity I.E. I cannot differenciate a comment just by its attributes since I can have twho different comments for the same post published by the same user with the same content...p  pI first thought of the order of the comment inside the posts comment list to identify the comment inside the post, but this becomes very complex in concurrent environments, like a web application where two clients can post comments on blogs and I would have collisions until I store them in the database. Besides that I need to keep the logic for restoring the comment list from repository in the same order the post was saved to the repository...p  pThen having a unique identifier counter inside the Post and autoincrement it with every comment published, but in concurrent environment becomes complex, so how do I model the local identity inside an aggregate rootp  pThanks Pablop

Negative 41325 pI used MPI to write a distribution layer. Let say we have n of data sources and k of data consumers. In my approach each of n MPI processes reads data, then distributes it to one or many of k data consumers other MPI processes in given manner logic.p  pSo it seems to be very generic and my question is there something like that already donep  pIt seems simple, but it might be very complicated. Let say that distribution checks which of data consumers is ready to work dynamic work distribution. It may distribute data according to given algorithm based on data. There are plenty of possibilities and I as every of us do not want to reinvent the wheel.p

Negative 41325 pI have taken over an Android project from a past employee and am wondering if there is an easy tool to use for profiling an Android application. I have a LinearLayout with a ProgressBar spinner inside of it. Now I am running a network call on a different thread while that spinner is showing. I use a translate animation to show the entire LinearLayout and when the network call returns on the other thread I hide the LinearLayout. Now this works great but I see that the spinner kind of stops spinning while it is showing. Now it kind of looks like if I interact with the screen, such as trying to scroll, the spinner will continue to spin. For a standard ProgressBar spinner do I need to set some command on the spinner to keep it spinning Any information on this would be great.p  pThanksp

Negative 41325 pFirst off my background Im new to Java coming over from Ruby. If that helps.p  pIm confused about how layout params work.  Im following a basic Hello World introduction to creating an Android App.  Step 1, extend the Activity class, and the onCreate method to access the XML layout.  Ok I get that.  p  pThen I create a layout say a RelativeLayout in the Main.XML.  So this is making use of the RelativeLayout class which extends the ViewGroup class, ok so far.  Then lets say I create a button inside this.  This is where my question starts.  If I look at the example I am following I see attributes being assigned to the button that belong to the RelativeLayout class i.e androidlayoutalignParentRighttrue.  These seem to be the layout params.  But why does this work  The button class seems to inherit from the View class.  Why can a button object accept attributes for the RelativeLayout object  Maybe my Ruby programming is confusing me..p  pThanksp  pUpdate For posterity sake thank you to Slothsberry for pointing out the a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidetopicsuideclaringlayout.html relnofollowXML Layoutsa link, which seems to describe the answer clearly in 2 sections the section on Attributes and on Layout Paramters.  The attributes section reads  p  blockquote   pEvery View and ViewGroup object supports their own variety of XML   attributes. Some attributes are specific to a View object for   example, TextView supports the textSize attribute, but these   attributes are also inherited by any View objects that may extend this   class. Some are common to all View objects, because they are inherited   from the root View class like the id attribute. And, other   attributes are considered layout parameters, which are attributes   that describe certain layout orientations of the View object, as   defined by that objects parent ViewGroup object.p blockquote  pThe layout parameters section though is perhaps the section that really answers this question.  Where it states p  blockquote   pEvery ViewGroup class implements a nested class that extends   ViewGroup.LayoutParams. This subclass contains property types that   define the size and position for each child view, as appropriate for   the view group. As you can see in figure 1, the parent view group   defines layout parameters for each child view including the child   view group.p blockquote  pThey give a nice diagram as well.  It seems that a beginning programmer needs to recognize that while Java classes are referenced, the XML acts more like a CSS sheet and that attributes are first computed in a nested fashion before being computed and carried over to their Java class counterparts.  Thats my current understanding anyways p

Negative 41325 pAlthough I have searched for many information about Cocoa Bindings, I still remain relatively unsatisfied with information I have and got. It seems that topic is somewhat troublesome for many and many are just avoiding this pattern, which I believe should not be. p  pOf course, it may seem that bindings are sometimes too complicated or perhaps designed with too much overhead...p  pHowever, I have one very direct and specific question Why is NSObjectController needed if I can establish bindings directlyp  pFor example, the codep  precode[controller bindcontentObject toObjectself withKeyPathnumberOfPieSlices optionsnil]  [slicesTextField bindvalue toObjectcontroller withKeyPathcontent optionsnil] [stepperControl bindvalue toObjectcontroller withKeyPathcontent optionsnil] codepre  pDoes exactly the same as p  precode[slicesTextField bindvalue toObjectself withKeyPathnumberOfPieSlices optionsnil]     [stepperControl bindvalue toObjectself withKeyPathnumberOfPieSlices optionsnil] codepre  pIn my case here, we are talking about property of the class inside which everything is happening, so I am guessing the need for NSObjectController is whenp  ul lipkey path for controller is object and binding of other controls is needed to its properties, not to its value as with primitives and wrappers around them is the case numberOfPiesSlices in my case is NSIntegerpli lipor when binding is needed from other outside objects, not only between objects within onepli ul  pCan anybody confirm or reject thisp

Negative 41325 pI want strongUserAstrong to be able to create a changelist in Perforce and then Shelve it.

When UserB runs p4 unshelve s 1234, it unshelves all of the changed emfilesem from change 1234, but it does not bring the changes metadata description, job fixes with it This means that UserB can emcopyem a shelved CL into a whole new CL and submit it by manually recreating the description and fixes, but that leaves the old shelved CL hanging around.p  pThe logical thing here would be for strongUserBstrong to olliUnshelve the CLliliView the shelved CLs metadatali liCopy that metadata into a emnewem CLliliSubmit the new CLliliDelete the old shelved CLliol Thats what the a hrefhttpwww.perforce.comperforcedoc.currentmanualsp4guide04files.htmlPerforce documentationa even recommends. Thered one little problem UserB is not allowed to delete another users shelved CLs Only UserA and a p4 admin can delete his shelved CL. I dont understand why the documentation glosses right over this.p  pHas anyone ever had this problem before How did you resolve itp  pEDIT I should clarify that my question is very generalized. Im working on a tool where strongUserAstrong is the developer, and strongUserBstrong is the build system itself. A developer would shelve a CL and then have the build system unshelve and validate it with a series of builds and tests automatically submitting the CL if it passed all of those tests. Expecting every developer to remember to delete their shelved CLs if the build system submitted them seems bound for failurep

Negative 41325 pI have an activity with 2 fragments. Ive decided to use a PageAdapter to swipe between the two views, but, to stay close to the android design best practices, ive also decided to use the action bar tabs fixed ones. Im using ActionBarSherlock and some code from the a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidappActionBar.htmlnewTab2829 relnofollowherea to implement the tabs. With just the pageadapter the activity worked wonderfully, now im having two issues 1 the first fragment MatchRugbyButtonFragment superimpress an image of himself, so if i touch it and move or change something, i see the image above the working fragment. 2 when i go to the second fragment, the first lose all the variables timer reset, counters reset, ecc. I had to create to tablistener because one fragment is a SherlockFragment and the other one is a SherlockListFragment and that caused an error where it couldnt cast the fragment to a SherlockListFragment.

If your domain registrar supports URL   redirects, you can  redirect from a hrefhttpyourdomain.com relnofollowhttpyourdomain.coma  to your app,   which can be served from  domains like a hrefhttpwww.yourdomain.com relnofollowhttpwww.yourdomain.coma or   a hrefhttpappid.yourdomain.com relnofollowhttpappid.yourdomain.coma.p      pFor instructions on how to configure a redirect for your Google Apps   domain,  please see the article on URL forwarding.p blockquote  pNow Id like not to resort to redirection. I understand udacity.com is hosted on     appengine and they seem to use a naked domain.p  pSo, Im hoping this is just typical bad documentation or not updated. Does anybody have     any info on how Udacity solves this problem or how could I produce such a behaviourp

Negative 41325 pGiven two abitrary HTML elements A and B in the same document, how can I find out which one is closer to the user i.e. if they overlap, which one is obscuring the otherp  pThe a hrefhttpwww.w3.orgTRCSS2visuren.htmllayers relnofollowW3C CSS Specificationa describes stacking contexts, which compliant rendering engines should implement. However, I couldnt find a way to access this information in a JavaScript program, crossbrowsers or not. All I can read is the css codezindexcode property, that per se doesnt say much, since most of the time is set to codeautocode or, even when expressed as a numeric value, is not a reliable indicator of how its actually displayed if they belong to different statcking contexts, comparing zindexes is irrelevant.p  pPlease note that Im interested in strongarbitrarystrong elements if both elements are below the mouse pointer, only one will be considered hovered, so I can easily find the closest one in this case. However, Im looking for a more general solution, preferably one that does not involve reimplementing the stacking algorithm that the rendering engine is already performing.p  pstrongUpdatestrong let me clarify a bit the reason behind this question I recently tackled a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq12095196520779a questiona that exposed a limitation in jQuerys drag and drop mechanism  it doesnt take zindexes into account when dropping, so if an element is obscuring another, it can still perform the drop operation in the element that is behind. While the linked question was answered for the OP particular case, the general problem persists, and theres no easy solution that I know of.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma12190361520779alexs answera below is useful, but not enough for the case at hand when dragging, the dragged element itself or more precisely its helper is the topmost element under the mouse cursor, so codeelementFromPointcode will return strongitstrong instead of the strongnextstrong topmost element, that we really need emworkaroundem a hrefhttpjqueryui.comdraggablecursorstyle relnofollowstyle the cursora so its placed outside the helper. The other intersection strategies that jQuery employ also take into account more than just one point, complicating the task of determining the topmost element that intersects the helper somehow. Being able to compare or sort elements by actual zindex would make a zindex aware intersection mode viable for the general case.p

Negative 41325 pI have a large image that I load into a UIImageView. The image is a PNG and its 2x file size is 384K. The image is 5119x2413 pixels. The image can be zoomed by the user by using pinch gestures. The reason the image is so large is so that when the UIImageView is transformed by pinching the quality will stay the same.p  pThe problem Im having is that on some devices especially the latest iPod Touch it will crash while attempting to display this screen. p  pIve ran the app via Instruments and profiled it using the LeakAllocations profiles. The apps live bytes generally hovers around 4MB when using the app, but as soon as you view the screen containing the UIImageView this shoots up to 40MB Onces the image is on the screen the memory returns to around 4MB.p  pThe problem Im having is that more times than not on older devices and ones limited by memory like the iPod Touch my app is being terminated by the system, along with some system services like SpringBoard.p  pIve tried using code[UIImage imageWithContentsOfFile]code instead of code[UIImage imageNamed]code to load the image as I am aware that code[UIImage imageNamed]code caches the image but this has had no effect.p  pIt seems that the spike in live memory caused when attempting to display the image for the first time is causing a low memory situation and the app is being terminated by the OS.p  pIm curious to how I can fix this, and how Apple are dealing with loading large images in the Photos app.p  pJust for the record Im using ARC and iOS 5.1.1 with XCode 4.4.1.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comsKQ9g.jpg altenter image description herep

Negative 41325 pIm studying dynamic programming and am looking to solve the following problem, which can be found here a hrefhttpwww.cs.berkeley.eduvaziranialgorithmschap6.pdfhttpwww.cs.berkeley.eduvaziranialgorithmschap6.pdfap  pYou are given a rectangular piece of cloth with dimensions X by Y, where X and Y are positive integers, and a list of n products that can be made using the cloth. For each product i in [1,n] you know that a rectangle of cloth of dimensions ai by bi is needed and that the final selling price of the product is ci. Assume that ai, bi, and ci are all positive integers. You have a machine that can cut any rectangular piece of cloth into two pieces either horizontally or vertically. Design an algorithm that finds the best strategy for cutting an X by Y piece of cloth so that the products made from the resulting pieces give the maximum sum of selling prices. You are free to make as many copies of a given product as you wish, or none if desired. From Algorithms by Dasgupta, Papadimitriou, and Vazirani.p  pIt seems we have a sort of 2dimensional knapsack problem, but Im thinking it may be possible to just solve it with the traditional knapsack algorithm by considering the weights as the areas of the rectangles.  Does this seem like a reasonable approachp  pThis is a programming assignment for a course Im taking so please only include conceptual discussion andor pseudocode to illustrate ideas.p

Negative 41325 pIm creating a midi piano roll editor. The Note class creates and contains a NOTEON object and an associated NOTEOFF object as well as a rectangle which the user manipulates on the screen to manipulate the pitch, timing and duration of the notes.  Below is the code for this class minus the code for the rectangle. I cant figure out why its not working properly.  The test program creates five of these Note objects and displays them on the piano roll grid, and they play properly.  The method for changing pitch works properly too when a rectangle is dragged up or down.  But the notes start misbehaving when I call the methods to change timing or duration. First of all, they dont play where theyre told when moved, and then if the notes are dragged on top of or extended over each other, the moved note will prevent the notes below it from playing.  My unit of movement sent to these methods as an arg is set to 16, so the note will always snap to a 16th beat position.

Negative 41325 pI am attempting to download a large file from a public URL. It seemed to work fine at first but 1  10 computers seem to timeout. My initial attempt was to use WebClient.DownloadFileAsync but because it would never complete I fell back to using WebRequest.Create and read the response streams directly.p  pMy first version of using WebRequest.Create found the same problem as WebClient.DownloadFileAsync. The operation times out and the file does not complete.p  pMy next version added retries if the download times out. Here is were it gets weird. The download does eventually finish with 1 retry to finish up the last 7092 bytes. So the file is downloaded with exactly the same size BUT the file is corrupt and differs from the source file. Now I would expect the corruption to be in the last 7092 bytes but this is not the case. Using BeyondCompare I have found that there are 2 chunks of bytes in the missing from the corrupt file totalling up to the missing 7092 bytes This missing bytes are at 1CA49FF0 and 1E31F380, way way before the download times out and is restarted.p  pWhat could possibly be going on here Any hints on how to track down this problem furtherp  pHere is the code in question.p  precode    public void DownloadFilestring sourceUri, string destinationPath              roughly based on httpstackoverflow.comquestions2269607howtoprogrammaticallydownloadalargefileincsharp         not using WebClient.DownloadFileAsync as it seems to stall out on large files rarely for unknown reasons.          using var fileStream  File.OpendestinationPath, FileMode.Create, FileAccess.Write, FileShare.Read                      long totalBytesToReceive  0             long totalBytesReceived  0              int attemptCount  0             bool isFinished  false              while isFinished                              attemptCount  1                 if attemptCount gt 10                                      throw new InvalidOperationExceptionToo many attempts to download.

Negative 41325 pI want to use Parse parse.com in my app.  Parse uses PFObject models.  Id like to use my own models throughout my code so that it doesnt depend on parse.  If possible Id like to design my app so that I can replace parse with another cloud service as seamlessly as possible if I wanted to.p  pIs this a good idea  Whats the best way to abstract the model storage so that there is no or minimal traces of Parse code in my appp  pPerhaps use the adapter design pattern to map parse objects to my own objects  Should this be an independent class or part of the model logicp  pIf anyone has tried something like this Id like to hear your thoughts.  Should I just use parse models directly in my code  Or perhaps a singleton factory to generate my models based on parse objects  p  pAny tipsthoughtscomments p
Negative 41325 pIn .Net 4 or 4.5, how would you design a serializable class that contains an instance of one class from a set of classes For instance, suppose I have a Garage class, which can hold an instance of any vehicle type classes, say Car, Boat, Motorcycle, Motorhome.

Negative 41325 pIm new to Java and Android. I have been trying for the past week to make an app for my phone. The app consists of 4 pages, which are diagrammed belowp  pimg srchttpi.imgur.comjrySQO9.jpg altDiagram explaining four pagesp  ul lipPage 1 Contains a picture taking up the size of the screen. If I click on the picture it needs to go to page 2.pli lipPage 2 Consists of an icon on the left say the flag for instance followed by a text field eg. USA. When USA strip is clicked it needs to go to page 3.pli lipPage 3 Consists of text, picture and then more text from a string. This page needs to correspond to the strip clicked on in page 2 USA in this example. There are also two buttons at the bottom of page 3 and page 4 which when pressed need to go to the corresponding page numbers.pli lipPage 4 This page is displayed if the More button is pressed on page 3.pli ul  pI would like this phone to work on a minimum Android 2.2 or 2.3. All logos, pictures and string texts need to be locally available resources folder and not website based. I have tried all sorts of combinations of codeListViewcodes and buttons with codeOnClickListenercodes as well as toast screens. My limited knowledge of programming is frustrating.p  pMy question is if there is a template around which will help me out with this app Or if there are any web resources.p

Negative 41325 pI have a Drupal 6 site that is frequently about once a day going down. The hosting provider is reporting that something in our site code is occupying all Apache threads but keeping them idle, making the server run out of threads to respond to new requests. A simple restart of Apache frees the threads and fixes the issue, though it reoccurs within a few hours or a day.p  pI have no idea how to troubleshoot this issue and have never come across PHP code doing this. Is there some kind of Apache settings change I can make to capture more information about what might be keeping a thread occupied but idle What typical PHP routines can cause this behavior I looked for code that connects to external resources, but didnt see any issues there.p  pAny hints for what to look at, capture more information, or PHP code that can cause this would be most useful.p
Negative 41325 pI have a strange bug with a custom rightBarButtomItem in the NavBar. I have a TabBar application. If the app is loaded the button shows up correct. If i click through the tabs the button keeps showing. If i go back to one of the tabs which was already shown the button disappears.

Negative 41325 pSo Im working my way through the second assignment for the Winter 2013 Stanford iOSObjectiveC class through iTunes U, and the very last part is driving me crazy.p  pThis is a card matching game. Each card is represented in the view as a UIButton. When the card object is face up the UIButton is in selected state, and when the card is face down the UIButton is in default state. A card can also be disabled after a match is found.p  pThe assignment asks to put an image on the back of the cards. In other words, each UIButton needs to show an image when it is in the default state, but then JUST the title property when it is in the selected or disabled state.p  pSeems simple enough...p  pFirst I tried this in the GUI Storyboard, setting the background image to my image, and then making sure both the selected and disabled states had no image. This resulted in the image showing, but then the title text just showing over the image. Some searching turned up the reason for this unless explicitly told so UIButton defaults all other UIControlStates to UIControlStateNormal.p  pNow Ive been trying to get this to work programmatically and still no luck. All the UIButtons which are cards are in an IBOutletCollection which is an NSArray cardButtons. In the viewDidLoad function I have a for loop that goes through all the buttonsp  precodeUIImage cardBack  [UIImage makeSomeImage...] for UIButton oneButton in cardButtons  [oneButton setBackgroundImagecardBack forStateUIControlStateNormal] [oneButton setBackgroundImagenil forStateUIControlStateSelected]  codepre  pWhich still gives me the same problem. It is definitely successfully setting the image for the default state, but then when I click on the button in the simulator, the image remains while the title simply displays over it.p  pIn both the GUI and programmatically I can get a different image to show up in selected and disabled state fine. All I have to do is addp  precode[oneButton setBackgroundImageanotherImage forStateUIControlStateSelected] codepre  pTo the loop and all the buttons show that other image when selected.p  pWhat I cannot do, and what is driving me crazy, is trying to get there to be no background image when selected so that the UIButton only shows the title...p  pEditp  pWhile not an ideal solution I think something might be possible using the imageView property in UIButton, but Im not sure, I have come up with a somewhat tackedon feeling way to make this work.p  pFirst I made the UIImage Im using into a class property called cardBackImage.p  pThen, in the updateUI function that loops through all the card buttons each time a change is made to the model, I added this line of codep  precode[cardButton setBackgroundImageoneCard.isFaceUp  nil  self.cardBackImage forStateUIControlStateNormal] codepre  pSo every time a card object is flipped that UIButton has to load or unload a UIImage into or out of its instance variable. Bleh... like I said, not ideal, but it works.p

Negative 41325 pIs there a tool that removes python code that isnt covered at run time, or a tool that removes code that isnt depended on by a particular function If not, what would be a good approachp  pHere is my problem more specificallyp  pI need the strongmaxflow subsetstrong of the strongnetworkxstrong algorithms module on github.p  pUsually I would just download the entire library and then import the modules I need howeverp  p1. I need to physically print out some of these algorithms onto paper.p  p2. Some competitions have an online judge that runs your code. The judge doesnt have networkx installed, so I need to cut and paste code I need into a single .py file before uploading to the judge. The judge imposes a 50,000 byte file size limit.p  pFor example, after cut and pasting one functionp  precodedef fordfulkersonG, s, t, capacitycapacity codepre  pBut fordfulkerson has dependencies on other algorithms, networkx custom errors and the entire networkx graph and digraph classes.p  pAfter cut and pasting these dependencies, I went from 50 lines of code to 3000 lines of code.p  pI looked at the coverage on some test cases that should cover everything and the coverage is only at 39. Most of that 39 is just reading function names of functions that arent even used.p  precodeCUsersrobertcodeplayspojgtcoverage run TOSCORE.py lt in.txt No goal Goal  CUsersrobertcodeplayspojgtcoverage report m Name      Stmts   Miss  Cover   Missing  TOSCORE     733    444    39   226, 233, 236, 252, 280283, 301, 377389, 4374 56, 489497, 526534, 568570, 597, 618, 633, 655658, 712715, 772801, 835, 86 4869, 900906, 948949, 988991, 10111014, 1107, 11151119, 11671170, 1195, 1 221, 12571260, 12971308, 13281331, 1357, 1361, 14061415, 1452, 14931512, 15 38, 15701574, 1600, 16361640, 16731677, 17041707, 17311733, 17571759, 1803 1828, 2029, 20782091, 21422154, 2160, 21932203, 22322243, 2296, 23002301, 23052307, 23092311, 23592391, 24242425, 24552459, 2467, 2474, 24832484, 24 902491, 2498, 2502, 25512562, 25882599, 2608, 26452658, 26982709, 27472758 , 27982801, 28382841, 28592862, 2867, 2910, 29492963, 29792990, 30323055, 3084, 30913092, 31343140, 31483151, 31783180, 3192, 3198, 3208, 3254, 32653 283 codepre

Negative 41325 pive got this problem, in a test program, where im developing a client for MQTT, im subscribed on a topic, after that, i wait for publish message from the server to my client.p  pAfter a good recv of a publish message or after a recv timeout i send a mqtt PINGREQ to the server.p  pAfter a A PINGREQ im going to wait a PINGRESP, then i call a recv as in the case I were waiting for a PUBLISH message.p  pIf the flow is thisp  precodeClient gt PINGREQ Server gt PUBLISH Server gt PINGRESP codepre  pThan the server publish message were lost. How to solve this Im using MQTT at QOS 0, it make sense solve this problem on this level of QOS or instead is smart to check this case at QOS1p

Negative 41325 pI believe that in addition, the lefthand and righthand sides can be swapped interchangeably, correct This rule doesnt seem to work with multimodular logic.p  pbThe basic conceptbbr nbspnbspnbspnbsp[1,2,3]  [4,5,6]  [5,7,9]brbr bAdding different lengthsbbr nbspnbspnbspnbsp[1,2,3]  [4,5]  [5,7,7] or [[5,7],7]br nbspnbspnbspnbsp[1,2]  [3,4,5]  [9,6] or [10,6] or [4,6,6] or [[4,6],6]br nbspnbspnbspnbspiAbove you can see different outputs, depending on how you view the logic. When the smaller array goes past its max index, it reverts back to the start. I would also assume that the length of the LHS has precedence in this case. But it could also either adhere to the larger length, or even add another module.ibrbr bMultimodular amp singular combinedbbr nbspnbspnbspnbsp[1,2,3]  1  [2,3,4]br nbspnbspnbspnbsp1  [1,2,3]  7 or 9 or [2,3,4]br nbspnbspnbspnbspiAgain, you can see how there are different ways of looking at this, now that the other ideas have been presented.ibrbrp  pI couldnt find any established documentation on this type of logic so any assistance would be wonderful. Ive added the current script at the bottom, which currently gives precedence to the LHS. Ive easily switched between the precedence of LHS, and length, and Im just not sure which way is the right way to go.brbrp  pAs requested, Ive added the logic behind the examples below.

However, the output of this little bit of test code is confusing mep  precodeecho ltpregt if CRYPTBLOWFISH  1      echo Blowfish SaltLen  18      . cryptstring that should be hashed, 2y08123456789012345678 . n     echo Blowfish SaltLen  19      . cryptstring that should be hashed, 2y081234567890123456789 . n     echo Blowfish SaltLen  20      . cryptstring that should be hashed, 2y0812345678901234567890 . n     echo Blowfish SaltLen  21      . cryptstring that should be hashed, 2y08123456789012345678901 . n     echo Blowfish SaltLen  22      . cryptstring that should be hashed, 2y081234567890123456789012 . n  echo ltpregt codepre  pOutputp  precodeBlowfish SaltLen  18     2y08123456789012345678.Gq4WBozZb6XYmOJ88OC8gThSTUx8pRO Blowfish SaltLen  19     2y081234567890123456789.u8Qm7Q9KVtvo2zwpKkN5ntAxu71k2pO Blowfish SaltLen  20     2y0812345678901234567890.iIlIFEGaqDj6XbnKkK1F14HmMGLV.mu Blowfish SaltLen  21     2y08123456789012345678901.iIlIFEGaqDj6XbnKkK1F14HmMGLV.mu Blowfish SaltLen  22     2y08123456789012345678901uSFz9yPijA6e9aMcUkm7y.TJYhcCoSu codepre  pThe apparantly crypt fills the salt with  if it is not long enough. The salt changes and so does the hash. So the output in line 1 and 2 are as expected.p  pWhat is puzzling me, however, are the last three hashes Apparantly the dot seperates the hash from the salt  but if you actually give crypt the 22 characters it demands as salt, the dot vanishes. Also, the last character from the salt does not appear in the output, but changes the hash compared to the 21 character salt.p  pWhat is especially confusing is line 3 and 4 in the output The salt is obviously different, but the hashes are exactly the same. I just cannot see any consistency in this and would greatly appreciate help.p

Negative 41325 pIs there a way to determine whether a given Charset java.nio.charset.Charset encodes characters using multiple bytes Or, alternatively, is there a list somewhere of character sets that dodo not use more than one byte per characterp  pThe reason Im asking is a performance tweak I need to know how long in bytes an arbitrary string is in a given character set.

Negative 41325 pWhen a user does some action, I need to pull a codeUICollectionViewcode from the bottom up to a certain height. Since that new state is totally optional, the collection view is created just before being presented that way. The animation from bottom to top is performed using changes to NSLayoutConstraints codeconstantcode property and a call to code[view layoutIfNeeded]code in some animation block.p  pThe problem is that, doing things that way makes the cells appear in an undesired way they expand from their topleft corner to their specified size. I would like the collection view to appear and have all of its cells already laid out in their final size and appearance. p  pIm aware of things like UIViews codesetAnimationEnabledcode method, but I cant seem to find how and where I should use that if thats the way to go.p  pI guess the problem is due to the collection view cells being added to the view hierarchy just before the animation block that contains the call to code[superview layoutIfNeeded]code. This probably leads UIKit to think that it should also animate emthoseem changes to the layout. If thats the case the solution would probably be something along the way of excluding from the animation, specific changes to the view hierarchy.p

Divs have different names but IDs of input fields are same across these divs. I was thinking if I can somehow differentiate child names using their parent div ids at server side, it would have been lot easier.

Negative 41325 pIm having some trouble uploading a file on Matlab. Ive loaded text files many times before either by using load data option under the file menu or with a command.

In the text file, the columns are separated by tabs and I set the delimiter as tabs. p  pDoes anyone have any idea why it would upload the info into one column rather than in separate columns p  pThanks p
Negative 41325 pIm a novice programmer who is very new to both AngularJS and the practice of unit testing. Ive spent hours trying to find the solution to this but Im becoming increasingly more confused. If anyone could point me in the right direction I would greatly appreciate it. Ill try to be as descriptive as possible. p  pstrongThe situation is thisstrong p  pI have created a service in AngularJS Service A that has a couple of functions. Each of these functions makes an http GET request to a REST API and returns an http promise object that contains JSON data. Within these functions, the URL is constructed through the implementation of another very simple service Service B that has been injected as a dependency into Service A. I have created a mock of Service B to isolate it from all of its dependencies. Both of these services are defined inside of the same module named services. In this case, there is no real need for this dependency but I just want to understand how it works.p  pUsing Jasmine, I would like to construct a unit test for Service A to ensure that the requests it is making to the API are constructed correctly and possibly if the correct JSON data is being returned. At the same time, I do not want any real API calls to be made.p  pstrongThis is what I knowstrongp  phttpBackend mock is what I need to be able to make fake calls to the API and it provides functionality to expect certain requests and return specified results.p  pI need to test the real Service A and inject the mock Ive created of Service B.

Negative 41325 pI have been learning about camera calibration and get confused in my way to understand how to recover extrinsic and intrinsic camera parameter from camera projection matrix. p  pIn general, we can derive camera projection matrix values by solving the equations from correspondences of 3D world coordinates to 2D screen coordinates and that is, we get an matrix lets say Cp  pC  [c11 c12 c13 c14 c21 c22 c23 c24 c31 c32 c33 c34]p  pAnd ussually, without loss of generality we can assign c34  1 and we can find the rest of the elements through correspondences 3D2D. p  pAfter that, we can compare camera projection matrix C to conjunction of ext and int matrix lets say M that can be arranged to be p  pM  [fxr1uxr3 fxtxuxtz fyr1uyr3 fytxuytz r3 tz] where r1, r2, r3 are the row vector of Rotation matrix and tx,ty,tz are translation. p  pWhat I could not make out is when we compare each of C elements to M elements to get the ext and int parameter, our tz translation about z will be 1 because we have assigned c34 prior to be 1. How can the tz always 1 can anyone explainp

Negative 41325 pI am trying to recreate a popular effect that all iPhone users have seen before on their settings page. Something like when selecting a wireless network. There is normally a title that says Available Networks with a blue arrow icon to the right. onClick there is an accordion style slide down effect to reveal the available networks.p  pI am trying to recreate this to use as a drop down input for my apps settings page since iPhone does not have anything like that in their storyboard builder interface. The other issue is the options will be dynamic coming from a database. p  pHas anyone seen a tutorial on this or maybe an open source app I can use as reference. p  pI am using iOS 6.1 using Storyboards.p  h2EDITh2  pI should have spent a little more time researching I am sure I would have have this post that was very helpful regardind the actual code for the dropdown not so much the dynamic data.  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13467029howtocreatedropdowninxcodeHow to create DropDown in xcodeap

Negative 41325 pI am working on a project where I need to dynamically build up web content coming from different sources same domain. All the main libraries and css are managed centrally but depending on a configuration I have to add pages html and embedded JavaScript as tab content.p  pMy first approach was using iframes and it worked well besides the annoyance that I had some duplicte code especially the header. I also had some issues with frame sizes but I could handle that in the end.p  pNow of course I read that iframes are evil but almost all the alternatives I found were using php or something else serverside. Unfortunately my web server does not provide anything like that, so I came across jQuerys load function. My first attempt is satisfying but what unsettles me now is managing global variables and functions. Because jQuery.load simply inserts the code into the DOM I always need to be extremely careful about naming here. For example I usually have a function called init which is included in the body for the onloadEvent. But every other page will need one of those as well.p  pThe project is very likely to grow maybe at some point even external developers will take part. I am now at a point where I have to decide which path to take and I am torn.p  pSo my Question Even though iframes are evil, im my experience it is a lot easier and secure than inserting the code via jQuery in this particular case. Oh, that was not a question... The question would be Is there any way to encapsulate variables and functions into the content that I load with jQuery Or might there be a better way of handling variablesfunctions in this case anyways.p  pI am grateful for any suggestions.p

Can someone please advise as to why this is happeningp  pThis is the XML filep  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gt lt Document created with online XML Editor httpxmlgrid.net 20130908 21741  gt    ltquantoptions dburltest attributegt          ltoptiongt                ltsymbolgttest stringltsymbolgt                ltdateselection enddate20020924 startdate20020924gtltdateselectiongt          ltoptiongt          ltoptiongt                ltsymbolgttest stringltsymbolgt                ltdateselection enddate20020924 startdate20020924gtltdateselectiongt                ltblackscholesgtfalseltblackscholesgt                ltvolatilitygttrueltvolatilitygt          ltoptiongt    ltquantoptionsgt codepre  pthis is the xsd filep  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingISO88591 gt ltxsschema xmlnsxshttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemagt                 ltxselement namequantoptionsgt                                 ltxscomplexTypegt                                                 ltxssequencegt                                                                 ltxselement maxOccursunbounded minOccurs1 nameoptiongt                                                                             ltxscomplexTypegt                                                                                                 ltxssequence maxOccurs1 minOccurs1gt                                                                                                                 ltxselement maxOccurs1 minOccurs1 namesymbol typexsstringgt                                                                                                             ltxselement maxOccurs1 minOccurs1 namedateselectiongt                                                                                                                             ltxscomplexTypegt                                                                                                                                             ltxsattribute nameenddate typexsdate userequiredgt                                                                                                                                             ltxsattribute namestartdate typexsdate userequiredgt                                                                                                                             ltxscomplexTypegt                                                                                                             ltxselementgt                                                                                                             ltxschoice maxOccursunbounded minOccurs0gt                                                                                                                             ltxselement maxOccurs1 minOccurs1 nameblackscholes typexsbooleangt                                                                                                                             ltxselement maxOccurs1 minOccurs1 namevolatility typexsbooleangt                                                                                                             ltxschoicegt                                                                                             ltxssequencegt                                                                             ltxscomplexTypegt                                                             ltxselementgt                                             ltxssequencegt                                             ltxsattribute namedburl typexsstring userequiredgt                             ltxscomplexTypegt             ltxselementgt codepre  pp  pand finally here is the code, exception is thrown on this line stdautoptr optionConfig quantoptions configPathp  precode    const stdstring configPath   ..configquantoptions.xml     stdautoptrltquantoptionsgt optionConfig quantoptions configPath      optionConfiggtdburl      forquantoptionsoptionconstiterator i optionConfiggtoption.begin i  optionConfiggtoption.end i              stdcoutltlt igtsymbol      codepre  pthanks in advancep

This means there is very little flexibility in how you configure the REGISTER and Trunk. A small mistake here which would not affect the general SIP provider has major impact here, perhaps this is a high security strategy from Bahnhof and Sipgate. In short having a bad register will prevent you from making outbound calls.p  pIt came down to this in sip.conf,p  precodeBad register register gt 55500XXXXXXmypasswordbahnhof2000 OK  register register gt 55500XXXXXXmypasswordbahnhof55500XXXXXX codepre  pThen in extensions.conf,p  precode[default] exten gt 55500XXXXXX,1,Goto010XXXXXXXin,s,1 codepre  pNow outbound calls work, however here is where Bahnhof is acutally even more tricky then Sipgate, Bahnhof has a cluster of SIP servers where a inbound call can originate from any of them. When Asterisk resolves bahnhoflda.soho1.voip.bahnhof.net it simply takes the first ip address and considers this the SIP peer. The problem is that a inbound SIP call can come from any of the six addresses and not only the address you registered at.p  pThe solution would be to add [bahnhofpeer01], [bahnhofpeer2] ... entries for each ip address,p  precode[bahnhofpeer01] typepeer contextdefault host77.240.208.19 insecureport,invite canreinviteno dtmfmoderfc2833  [bahnhofpeer02] typepeer contextdefault host77.240.208.20 insecureport,invite canreinviteno dtmfmoderfc2833  ... codepre  pstrongORstrongp  pSimply set in sip.conf,p  precode[general] contextdefault allowguestyes alwaysauthrejectyes codepre  pextensions.conf,p  precode[default]  Incoming calls on SE line 010XXXXXXX steered from register section exten gt 55500XXXXXX,1,Goto010XXXXXXXin,s,1  NOTHING MORE UNDER default  [extensions] ... codepre  pThis would allow any incoming calls to be accepted, even unauthenticated ones. One might see this as a security risk but I have all VoIP traffic tightly locked down by firewall rules so this is the solution I went with. Also, as long as you have the context set to default in [general] and you have a proper setup with nothing under the [default] context except the inbound extension you will be fine. Anonymous inbound calls will have no access to you trunks or extensions, only access to inbound extensions which they obviously will need to know 55500XXXXXX to get through to your inbound rules for your Bahnhof number.p  pSo finally, this solution enabled both outbound and inbound calls via the Bahnhof SIP provider. Technically what seems to happen when you use the username as the extension on the register line is that this forces a Digest Auth towards the SIP server when an outbound call is made. This in turn seems to satisfy the SIP server with the domainname part in the URI. This is not completely clear to me in relevance but obviously plays a part.p

And heres the kicker. I have this EXACT code running in a different project. Most of this code was copypasta from that earlier project that compiles just fine. p  pIm running both projects in Xcode 5. The files themselves resdefault.vert and resdefault.frag have been added to the target and are listed in the Compile Sources listing under the targets Build Phases tab. In other words, everything seems in order, but I cant figure out why it wont load the files in this project. Is there some mysterious Xcode setting Im missing Id suspect the code if it wasnt 100 identical to the code in the working project. The other project also mimics the file structure with both the .vert and .frag files living in a res folder. The only difference is that the source files that attempt to read the files live in a src subdirectory. My understanding though is that I should be able to reference the files relative to the project, not the actual source files themselves. Just in case, I tried ..resdefault.vert to no avail.p  pAny help is appreciated. Cheersp

Please correct me if I am wrong So in this simplistic scenario I can easily test return values and behavior of codefunc1code since it is global. However, in order to test codefunc2code I also would have to return its reference. Rightp  precodereturn      func1  func1,     testfunc2  func2  codepre  pThis makes the code slightly less pretty, but overall is still ok. However, if I wanted to mock codefunc2code and replace its return value by using  codeJasmine spycode I would not be able to since that method is inside a closure.p  pSo my question is how to structure requirejs modules to be fully testable Are there better patterns for this situation than revealing module pattern p

I use the ServiceStack.Redis, its a redis client for .net. My problem is  If two same request operate the redis, we define they are A and B. A find it doesnt exist the same request, then B find it doesnt exist the same request too, then A try to set the value in redis,but B try the same things too .Did redis deal this situation How to deal the concurrency two write requests in redis  should i use set or hash to store the user registion datap

Negative 41325 ppHi, there.ppI want to create Windows 8 app, using HTML and JavaScript, and want to record sound and represent real time the sound variation with a graphic. I followed this a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsappshh452798.aspx relnofollowarticlea and was able to record  the sound to an mp3 file. What I want to achieve, in addition, is to attach to some event, that gives me real time information about the recorder sound. Then using that data I want to analyze it, take all or some of the discrete points of the sound representation,  convert them to JSON for example and then visualize that information. I have all the available resources unless that I cannot get real time representation. I investigated the oMediaCapture object see code below, but couldnt get such functionality.

Negative 41325 pIt looks like if a background thread is running when you hit the home button, things are suspended and then resumed when reopening the app. I simply want things to stop when the home button is pressed so that on resume, the user can start things from the beginning. After doing some research, it looks like a simple bool flag to periodically check is the way to go. My question, is the part after that. I have the flag part working using some of the notifications like UIApplicationWillResignActiveNotification, but my question is what action to take to actually stop things. I can do a simple return to stop things, but how does that affect the thread itself As a general question, if nothing is running, or it gets to the end of the code, will the thread close itself Or is some sort of explicit exit call needed In my rough testing, that thread seems to go away, but I wasnt sure. p

Negative 41325 pIm going through the knockoutjs tutorial. Ive slighly modified it to see what happens. So I started with the working with lists and collections tutorial.

Negative 41325 pAs the documentation for mudcube MIDI.js seems to be lacking in this regard, Im hoping there is someone who might be able to point me in the right direction. To put it plainly, using midi.js, how do you adjust the duration and ending of midi notesp  pFor some background, Ive created a music staff widget with draggable and droppable notes jQueryui, that can be added or removed, to form sequences which can be called upon to playback midi. Everything works thus far as it should, however, as Im trying to expand the functionality of this widget with more intricate timing, Ive run into some issues. p  pIt seems that I can only play the notes at a set duration and, for all my efforts, havent been able to implement changes that could vary this duration to say, half notes, quarter notes, eight notes, etc. Also, and this may be one of the causes, MIDI.noteOff has no perceivable effect on the output. One would think that a given note would play indefinitely until MIDI.noteOff is called, however, said note will play and then trail off regardless of whether noteOff is called. p  pLet me say here that I have done extensive research on SO and the web in general to get to the bottom of this. I have found people with similar problems and applied their fixes but their answers do not work for me. See a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14301785howdoiplayarbitrarymidinoteswithjavascripthow do I play arbitrary notes in Midi with javascripta and a hrefhttpsgithub.commudcubeMIDI.jsissues11 relnofollowMIDI.noteOff does not seem to work reliablyap  pI have a sequence of notes called noteSequence where each note is an object with noteValue i.e. C4 and noteDuration properties that are converted into a midiSequence in the function convertToMidiSequence. Everything works well with melodic sequences and chords, I just want to have the duration functionality added. I should also say that adjusting the delay variable or the noteDuration property only adds to the time before the sequence is played. Then after the initial delay, the sequence plays with the same timing as before.p  pThank you for taking some time to look this over and hopefully help out. It would be very much appreciated. p  pHere is the applicable code that runs my MIDIp  precodedocument.readyfunction    MIDI.loadPlugin     soundfontUrl GLOBALS.SOUNDFONTURL,     instrument acousticgrandpiano,     callback function        var channel  0,           instrument  0,           velocity  127,           delay  1       MIDI.programChange0, instrument           function playCurrentSequence    playSequencenoteSequence   function playSequencesequence    var midiSequence  convertToMidiSequencesequence   for var i  0 i lt midiSequence.length i      if midiSequence[i] instanceof Array        playNotemidiSequence[i], i          else        playChordmidiSequence[i], i           function playNotemidiNote, notePositionInMeasure    var channel  0,       velocity  127,       delay  1   MIDI.noteOnchannel, midiNote, velocity, delay  notePositionInMeasure  1   MIDI.noteOffchannel, midiNote,     delay  midiNote.noteDuration  notePositionInMeasure  1   MIDI.Player.stop   function playChordmidiChord, notePositionInMeasure    var channel  0,       velocity  127,       delay  1   for var i  0 i lt midiChord.length i      MIDI.noteOnchannel, midiChord[i], velocity, delay  notePositionInMeasure  1     MIDI.noteOffchannel, midiChord[i],       delay  midiChord[i].noteDuration  notePositionInMeasure  1     MIDI.Player.stop     codepre

Negative 41325 pSorry if the title is confusing, Im not exacting sure how I should label this, I tried.p  pIm writing a program to do some cross index searching, the program is written in C using Visual Studio 2010.p  pI have a table with 3 columns codeCategorycode, codeTypecode, and codeItemcode. The table is read in from a excel spreadsheet and stored in some kind of data structure will explain this later. Below is a short example of the table.p  precode CATEGORY   TYPE   ITEM   ltltheader row  categoryA  typeA  itemA  ltltfirst entry  categoryA  typeB  NA     categoryA  typeC  itemB   categoryA  typeD  NA    codepre  pI will be reading two user input strings, and I want the program determine whether they are a match. [Assuming user input has no typo, I have written a function to handle this and normalize both strings]p  pThe logic of determine whether two strings are a match is like thisp  p1 If a string is a codeCATEGORYcode, every codeTYPEcode and codeITEMcode that has the same codeCATEGORYcode is a match.p  p2 If a string is a codeTYPEcode or codeITEMcode, only other data in the same row is a matchp  pHere are some examples, string a and b are two input strings and match is a boolean valuep  precode1 a  categoryA, b  typeA, match  true 2 a  categoryA, b  itemB, match  true 3 a  typeC, b  itemB, match  true 4 a  typeC, b  itemA, match  false 5 a  itemA, b  itemB, match  false codepre  pIll give more examples if this is not clear enough.p  pstrongSo my overall question isstrong what is the most suitable data structure to store the data from the excel spreadsheet, and how would I do searchcompare match with this data structurep  pI though of using a codeDictionaryltstring, stringgtcode, so I can search string a in the dictionary and get a list of match strings and compare, but this way I will have a huge dictionary and multiple same key, which will not work.p  pAny suggestionhelp is appreciated.p

Negative 41325 pI want the users of my site to be able to click on a Google map marker and be redirected to a page relating to this marker. The markers represent hotels and the related page shows various bits of information about the particular hotel. This page is created using PHP calls to a SQL database so I cannot simply supply the URL to the marker as it needs to know which hotel was clicked on to populate the page with the relavent info.p  pIs it possible to run a script upon clicking the marker rather than a redirect to a URL That way I can make the calls to the database using PHP in the script and create the page and load it up. What I would need is just some hidden information sent from the marker to the script which would determine which hotels marker had been clicked.p

Negative 41325 pIm not sure if this is possible or not, and Im afraid I have no code at the moment, but Im working on it.  Ive been searching for techniques like what Im trying to do, but Im not sure if anything is out there... let me explain conceptualy what Im trying to do...p  pI have a small multithreaded VB.net application Im writing.  In this application Im using a com object.  Initially I was trying to share this object between multiple threads  no dice.  It was breaking on a wait for event line, which was when I learned about message pumping...  Which Im not sure Im up to.p  pSo, what I would like to try to do is set up a thread with that object and keep it running in a loop waiting for input from one of the other threads.  When it gets such input, Id like it to use the com object to perform a few tasks and then update a private class level collection, and then return to looping until I kill it.  p  pIve been looking around to see if any sort of functionality like this is described anywhere, but Im coming up dry.  Id most likely be creating this thread as a task... heres sort of what Im thinking the first part would look like...p  precodeDim openCheckTask As Task openCheckTask  Task.Factory.StartNewSub openOrderCheck  ...  Sub openOrderCheck  Dim myComObject As ComObject  New ComObject  Do     Wait for input lt   This sort of plays into what Im looking for...     myComObject.doSomeStuff     SomeCollection.AddsomeValue Loop   End Sub codepre  pI really have no idea how to proceed from there.  Its also worth noting that this thread would need to have a cue of commands, it could be executing one and have another or more waiting to be executed... not sure if that is possible either.p  pAny hints or suggestions are appreciated  Thanks again for your time everyone.p

The first link has the edge clipping, and the second link has the regular Voronoi working on Google Maps with zoom, but the circles Im using to clip the Voronoi diagram do not move correctly during the zoom. p  pHeres the code that I have, based on a hrefhttpbl.ocks.orgnjvack1405439 relnofollowhttpbl.ocks.orgnjvack1405439a and a hrefhttpbl.ocks.orgshimizu5610671 relnofollowhttpbl.ocks.orgshimizu5610671ap  precodevar map  new google.maps.Mapdocument.getElementByIdmapcanvas, mapOptions  var transitLayer  new google.maps.TransitLayer transitLayer.setMapmap   load the data  d3.csv201402stationdata.csv, functiondata     function sanFrand  if d.landmark  San Francisco return d   data  data.filtersanFran    var overlay  new google.maps.OverlayView    overlay.onAdd  function       var layer  d3.selectthis.getPanes.overlayLayer.appenddiv       .attrclass, svgOverlay     var svg  layer.appendsvg     var svgoverlay  svg.appendg.attrclass,voronoi      var paths, points, clips     clips  svgoverlay.appendsvgg.attrid, pointclips     points  svgoverlay.appendsvgg.attrid, points     paths  svgoverlay.appendsvgg.attrid, pointpaths      overlay.draw  function         var projection  this.getProjection         try to get just the coordinates to use for voronoi       var positions  []       data.forEachfunctiond             var googleCoordinates  new google.maps.LatLngd.lat, d.long         var pixelCoordinates  projection.fromLatLngToDivPixelgoogleCoordinates         positions.push[pixelCoordinates.x4000, pixelCoordinates.y4000]               var polygons  d3.geom.voronoipositions        clips.selectAllclipPath           .datadata           .attrcx, functiond,i  return positions[i][0]            .attrcy, functiond,i  return positions[i][1]            .attrr, 30         .enter.appendsvgclipPath           .attrid, functiond, i  return clipi         .appendsvgcircle           .attrcx, functiond,i  return positions[i][0]            .attrcy, functiond,i  return positions[i][1]            .attrr, 30        var pathAttr           d functiond, i return M  polygons[i].joinL  Z,         clippath functiond,i  return urlclipi,         id functiond,i  return pathi,         fill red, d3.rgb130, 230, 230,         fillopacity 0.4,         stroke d3.rgb200,200,200               paths.selectAllpath           .datadata           .attrpathAttr         .enter.appendsvgpath           .attrpathAttr        var circleAttr           cx functiond, i  return positions[i][0] ,         cy functiond, i  return positions[i][1] ,         r 2,         stroke none               points.selectAllcircle           .datadata           .attrcircleAttr         .enter.appendsvgcircle           .attrcircleAttr           overlay.setMapmap  codepre  pApologies if this is too close to older questions, and I appreciate any help. p

This still        permits filtering via the API methods.         filter via api         var filterBy                    username  student,        name        richard,        birthdate   gt01011975              table.setfilterBy,filterBy      As new records are inserted into the tables data ModelList, they will be checked against the filter to determine if they will be rendered      The current filters are stored in the filterBy attribute. Assigning this value at instantiation will automatically filter your data.      Filtering is done by a simple value comparison using , , lt, lt, gt, gt  on the field value.       If you need custom filtering, add a filter function in the columns filterFn property.

Negative 41325 pThis is an issue that I have been having for quite some time, and I cannot for the life of me get it fixed properly.  Using the RSS Feed a hrefhttpwww.localendar.compublicRogerJohnsonstyleM3 relnofollowhttpwww.localendar.compublicRogerJohnsonstyleM3a, I have my app set up to parse the XML and list each calendar entry into the row of a TableView.  The issue pops up when DST begins.  Localendar doesnt have a feature for checking if an event occurs in DST, so in the RSS feed the pubDate always shows asp  precodeFri, 02 May 2014 190000 EST codepre  pThe event for that day actually begins at 700 PM EDT.  So, when the app converts everything around, it takes the EST to heart, and knowing it is currently in DST, displays the time as 200000 EDT.  How can I properly set this NSDate so that no matter if it is DST or not, it will show 700 instead of adjusting by an hourp  pHere is how I am parsing the RSSp  precode NSString articleDateString  [item valueForChildpubDate]             NSDate articleDate  [NSDate dateFromInternetDateTimeStringarticleDateString formatHintDateFormatHintRFC822]            NSLog, articleDate             RSSEntryCalendar entry  [[[RSSEntryCalendar alloc] initWithBlogTitleblogTitle articleTitlearticleTitle articleUrlarticleUrl articleDatearticleDate articleImagebodyoftext] autorelease] codepre  pThen, displaying in table view I have for cellForRowAtIndexPathp  precodeRSSEntryCalendar entry  [allEntries objectAtIndexindexPath.row]      NSDateFormatter  dateFormatter  [[[NSDateFormatter alloc] init] autorelease]     [dateFormatter setTimeStyleNSDateFormatterMediumStyle]     [dateFormatter setDateStyleNSDateFormatterMediumStyle]     [dateFormatter setTimeZone[NSTimeZone timeZoneWithNameAmericaNewYork]]     NSString articleDateString  [dateFormatter stringFromDateentry.articleDate]       cell.detailTextLabel.text  articleDateString codepre  pAs mentioned before, pubDate always shows EST, regardless of DST being in effect or not.

Negative 41325 pThis isnt actually something Im currently attempting to do it just occurred to me while working with another table that I have no idea how Id go about doing it, and the entire time on the train ride home I was puzzling over different solutions, none of which I could imagine working.p  pImagine this situation there is a table of 50 rows. On each row is a button. When clicked, this button should do something to the row its on  say, make all its text strikethrough, or make an AJAX call with the first cells value, or something. p  pHow would you go about binding those event handlers p  pMy initial thought was something likep  precodebuttons  document.getElementsByTagNameinput rows  document.getElementsByTagNametr for i0iltbuttons.lengthi      buttons[i].addEventListenerclick,function          makeAjaxCallrows[i]        codepre  pThat is,p  ol liFor each button in the document,li liAdd an event handler to that button,li liWhich will makeAjaxCall with the data of the row whose number corresponds to the button.li ol  pThe problem, of course, being that codemakeAjaxCallcode will check the value of codeicode emwhen its invokedem, by which time, codeicode is equal to codebuttons.lengthcode, and so the function will only ever work on the final row of the table.p  pSo I suppose youd need to find some way to actually hardcode the current value of codeicode within the function handler... and thats something I dont even think is possible.

Negative 41325 pI need to integrate PayU payment gateway via Omnipay into one of my ExpressionEngine2 2.8.1 websites thus I need to write this gateway for the shopping cart ExpressoStore I am using in my project. p  pTo achieve this, I am looking at the other payment gateways that is already included in the store addon and trying to make sense of what is going on there and trying to follow those examples. Unfortunately there is almost no comments in the existing gateways and I would really like to know what happens in each class rather than just following examples. I see that most of these have pretty much the same structure, although in some gateways there is a class or function missing, or the one gateway handles things different to another gateway.p  pI also know that I need to write an extension to install this new gateway as the copypaste method is a no no when you need to update your gateway.p  pMy main concern is what happens in the codegetDatacode and codesendDatacode functions of the codePurchaseRequestcode class and how do I know which classesfunctions to includep  pAny help will do.

Negative 41325 pIm building an application for SNMP Trap logging. It has two MySQL tables one with the traps, and one with the hosts that I want to log.p  pThe traps table is filled externally. The hosts can be entered through the website. A host CAN have one or many traps. A trap CAN have one host.p  pSo this is a many to one relationship, but optional on both sides.

Negative 41325 pI am currently in the design phase of a new project where we have a requirement to be able to configure easily the page flow of a web application will be MVC5.p  pWe provide the same web solution to many clients. Now each of the clients have different users who access the application we provide and host. This users have to go through a registration process, which can be totally different for each client. Some require the user to be approved before registering, some require payment before registering, some require to upload a certain document before proceeding in the registration process. If we add a new client in the future, we want to be flexible as much as possible to allow us to simple configure the client in a DB, without any code change and the registration page flow will work as expected.p  pI was thinking of using Windows Workflow 4 to achieve this. My rough approach is as followsp  ul liHost WF within a WCF serviceli liSend request to WF service to getNextPage or previous page of the flow for that cient IDli liThe WF service needs to query a DB to get the specific flow for that client or would they just retrieve the input parameters requiredli liRun the workflow logic and return the next page or if they have to wait for approval etc.li ul  pSo my questions arep  ol liIs WF4 the best tool for the scenario described aboveli liCan I generate one overall workflow with various conditional logic to suit all needsli liDo I simply store the parameters for each client in DB and retrieve them each time the service is called These will act as inputs into the decisions that need to happen throughout the workflow.li liDoes anyone have any examples of this working in practice I cant seem to find any proper examples via Google.li liAs an example, how would an approval activity work within the workflowli ol

Negative 41325 pIve been working with the new JavaFx 3D api. JavaFx 8 introduced the subscene node, which contains its own scene graph and can simultaneously be rendered as a node in a scene. This allows you to render 3D nodes with a perspective camera within the subscene while rendering the HUD nodes on top orthogonaly. This works fine until you try and move HUD components. If the nodes within the subscene have not moved, JavaFx will not redraw it. So it just leaves black artifacts where the HUD used to be. Is there some way to force the subscene to be redrawn p  pEDIT One way Ive managed to fix the problem is rendering a cube off screen that spins indefinitely. Because it is always spinning, the subscene is always being updated. This seems like a ridiculous way to fix it but it is the best I can do for now. Still looking for better solutions...p

Negative 41325 pIs IBAction just a syntactical difference in Swift or does it signify something specific. Also, similar usage is seen in AppDelegate.swift where UIApplicationMain is written.p
Negative 41325 pAs the title tells, how CSS could affect form submission behavior I have a CAS server version 3.5.2, which we try to modify the look by modifying the JSP it have. We bought a set of web template, and our web designer prepare me the new look for the CAS logon along with the CSS taken from the template.p  pAfter I put all the CAS form, parameter and attribute to the emnewem JSP and put to the test, suddenly CAS stop working. By means of stop working is that CAS couldnt get all the parameter specifies on the JSP. I believe you will ask, it should be caused by the script that included in the JSP. Well the simple answer is no, we dont use any javascrIm not aipt inside the JSP. I put the code for the reference.p  pAfter all the odds, what I found is if I removes all the css link found on the screen, suddenly it working again. The uglyemishem screen works perfectly. That drives me to ask this question, how could a CSS affect the form submission CSS and javascript is not my emplaygroundem, so any suggestion or references would be a nice catch for me.p  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lt page sessiontruegt lt page pageEncodingUTF8gt lt page contentTypetexthtml charsetUTF8gt lt taglib prefixc urihttpjava.sun.comjspjstlcoregt lt taglib prefixspring urihttpwww.springframework.orgtagsgt lt taglib prefixform urihttpwww.springframework.orgtagsformgt lt taglib prefixfn urihttpjava.sun.comjspjstlfunctionsgt lt page importjava.util.gt  lthtmlgt ltheadgt lttitlegtAuthentication Servicelttitlegt ltmeta namekeywords contentgt ltmeta namedescription contentgt ltmeta nameviewport     contentwidthdevicewidth, initialscale1.0, userscalablenogt lttheme colourgt ltlink relstylesheet idcolor hrefcssblue.cssgt lt medicom style gt ltlink hrefcssmedicom.css relstylesheetgt lt Bootstrap gt ltlink hrefcssbootstrap.css relstylesheetgt lt jCarousel skin stylesheet gt ltlink relstylesheet typetextcss hrefcssjcarouselskin.css gt lt date picker gt ltlink hrefcssjqueryui1.10.3.custom.css relstylesheetgt lt Form styling gt ltlink relstylesheet hrefcssuniform.default.css mediascreen gt lt CSS STYLE gt ltlink relstylesheet typetextcss hrefcssrevolutionstyle.css     mediascreen gt lt REVOLUTION BANNER CSS SETTINGS gt ltlink relstylesheet typetextcss hrefcsssettings.css     mediascreen gt  ltlink relicon hrefltcurl valuefavicon.ico gt             typeimagexicon gt ltheadgt ltbodygt     ltsection classsliderrevolution datastellarbackgroundratio0.3gt         ltdiv classsliderrevolutionoverlaygtltdivgt         ltdiv classcontainergt             ltheader classmedicomheadergt                 ltnav classnavbar navbardefault rolenavigationgt                     lt Collect the nav links, forms, and other content for toggling gt                     ltdiv classnavbarheadergt                         lta classnavbarbrand hrefindex.htmlgt ltimg                             srcimageslogo.gif altLogo                             titleLokogt                         ltagt                     ltdivgt                      lt .navbarcollapse gt                 ltnavgt                 ltdiv classheaderbottomlinegtltdivgt             ltheadergt         ltdivgt         ltdiv classcontainergtltdivgt     ltsectiongt      ltdiv classheight40gtltdivgt     ltdiv classcontainergt         ltdiv classrowgt             ltdiv classcolmd7gt                 ltdiv classlatestnews2gt                      lth2 classlight borderedgt                         ltimg srcimagesads.png                             classimgresponsive visiblexm visiblexs alt titlegtltbr gt                         ltspangt Authentication Serviceltspangt                     lth2gt                     lt Indicates caution should be taken with this action gt                     ltcif testnot pageContext.request.securegt                         ltdiv classalert alertdangergt                             lth2gtNonsecure Connectionlth2gt                             lta href classclose datadismissalertgt amptimes ltagt                             ltpgtYou are currently accessing CAS over a nonsecure                                 connection.

Negative 41325 pI am attempting to add a callback from an android MapFragment. p  pMy original code looked something like thisp  precodeOverride protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      super.onCreatesavedInstanceState      setContentViewR.layout.activitymain     if savedInstanceState  null          Put the map fragment into the main window         FragmentManager fm  getFragmentManager         fm.beginTransaction                 .addR.id.container, new PlaceholderFragment.commit         fm.executePendingTransactions         MapFragment sf  MapFragmentfm.findFragmentByIdR.id.map         googleMap  sf.getMap      codepre  pUnfortunately though, there is a delay between the actual call to inject the fragment into the placeholder and the ability for the fragment manager to actually be able to get the GoogleMap because it is asynchronous and may not be finished being instantiated before the call to getMapp  pSo I decided I wanted to add a callback into the Fragment, on its onActivityCreated method that will callback to this activity, and do what I need to do with the map then, since by then the Map Should be created and I can call getMap without a problem.p  pSo I created an interfacep  precodepublic interface MapCreatedListener   public void onGoogleMapCreation  codepre  pAnd I extended MapFragmentp  precodepublic class MyMapFragment extends MapFragment   MapCreatedListener mListener  Override public void onActivityCreatedBundle savedInstanceState   TODO Autogenerated method stub super.onActivityCreatedsavedInstanceState mListener.onGoogleMapCreation      return the listener   public MapCreatedListener getListener      return mListener     param listener the listener to set   public void setListenerMapCreatedListener listener     mListener  listener  codepre  pAnd I made sure my original activity implements the interfacep  precode  public myClass extends Activity implements MapCreatedListener    ...     Override    public void onGoogleMapCreation         System.out.printlnCALLBACK HAPPENED       initializeMap          ....      codepre  pSo now all the framework is in place to where I should now just need to register my original activity as a listener, by calling p  precode            setListenerthis   from my activity on the mapFragment.... So.. I change my activity code to look like this  Override protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      super.onCreatesavedInstanceState      setContentViewR.layout.activitymain     if savedInstanceState  null          Put the map fragment into the main window         FragmentManager fm  getFragmentManager         fm.beginTransaction                 .addR.id.container, new PlaceholderFragment.commit         fm.executePendingTransactions         MyMapFragment sf  MyMapFragmentfm.findFragmentByIdR.id.map         sf.setListenerthis      codepre  pbut The findFragmentById always returns null for the same reason... So, how the heck to I link this all up  I need to get the googlemap but only after its fully created, but that wont happen until after the fragment is created, any my injection of the fragment, and FragmentManager is asynchronous as well... So how the heck do I like this all up, so that my activity will not try to get the GoogleMap before all of this other stuff is finished with its asynchronous stuffp  pThere has to be a way... I am just not seeing it at the moment.p

Negative 41325 pWhile trying to use SpriteKit in an iOS 8 keyboard extension, I have run into numerous crashes that only occur when using a physical device and not attached to the debugger. p  pIf the debugger is connected to device, or if running in the SIM, everything is lovely.p  pWhen the debugger isnt attached, I believe the lifecycle of the extension is slightly different, and there are times in which the keyboard extension is backgrounded, causing crashes in OpenGL. p  pThe crash we are hitting is a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosqaqa1766index.html relnofollowdescribed in an apple tech notea. It is in the function gpusReturnNotPermittedKillClient , and Apple states that it occurs because you cant run OpenGL in the background, and suggests using App Delegate callbacks to pause your OpenGL activity. p  pSince this is a keyboard extension, there is no app delegate. Instead we tried registering for app delegate lifecycle notifications no luck  they dont fire. So we tried using viewcontroller lifecycle callbacks, and it still doesnt fix the issue.p  pWhen this crash happens, we are the active keyboard, and are just doing a lot of stuff around SpriteKitSKView and UIImage manipulation, there is no obvious reason why we would be backgrounded, but yet this crash occurs. The same crash does seem to occur if we we truly do get backgrounded.p  pUltimately, Im trying to figure out how to know that we are being backgrounded, and that we need to pause OpenGL. p  pHere is the full stackp  precodeException Type  EXCBADACCESS SIGSEGV Exception Subtype KERNINVALIDADDRESS at 0x0000000000000001 Triggered by Thread  0  Thread 0 name  Dispatch queue com.apple.spritekit.renderQueue Thread 0 Crashed 0   libGPUSupportMercury.dylib      0x000000018e89a18c gpusReturnNotPermittedKillClient  12 1   libGPUSupportMercury.dylib      0x000000018e89b124 gpusSubmitDataBuffers  160 2   GLEngine                        0x0000000189a10260 gliPresentViewESExec  192 3   GLEngine                        0x0000000189a10164 gliPresentViewES  80 4   OpenGLES                        0x0000000189a1fc7c [EAGLContext presentRenderbuffer]  68 5   SpriteKit                       0x000000018a51c4a4 [SKView renderContent]  1028 6   libdispatch.dylib               0x0000000196c8d368 dispatchclientcallout  12 7   libdispatch.dylib               0x0000000196c966e4 dispatchbarriersyncfinvoke  72 8   SpriteKit                       0x000000018a51c060 [SKView renderContent]  88 9   SpriteKit                       0x000000018a519034 29[SKView setUpRenderCallback]blockinvoke  60 10  SpriteKit                       0x000000018a545fd4 [SKDisplayLink callbackForNextFrame]  268 11  QuartzCore                      0x000000018a04d27c CADisplayDisplayLinkItemdispatch  28 12  QuartzCore                      0x000000018a04d114 CADisplayDisplayLinkdispatchitemsunsigned long long, unsigned long long, unsigned long long  320 13  IOKit                           0x00000001870458cc IODispatchCalloutFromCFMessage  372 14  CoreFoundation                  0x0000000185e995e0 CFMachPortPerform  176 15  CoreFoundation                  0x0000000185eae1fc CFRUNLOOPISCALLINGOUTTOASOURCE1PERFORMFUNCTION  52 16  CoreFoundation                  0x0000000185eae15c CFRunLoopDoSource1  432 17  CoreFoundation                  0x0000000185eac0dc CFRunLoopRun  1636 18  CoreFoundation                  0x0000000185dd90a0 CFRunLoopRunSpecific  392 19  GraphicsServices                0x000000018ef7b5a0 GSEventRunModal  164 20  UIKit                           0x000000018a70e3bc UIApplicationMain  1484 21  libxpc.dylib                    0x0000000196e9c268 xpcobjcmain  764 22  libxpc.dylib                    0x0000000196e9df50 xpcmain  196 23  Foundation                      0x0000000186eafc7c [NSXPCListener resume]  180 24  PlugInKit                       0x0000000190e8a90c [PKService run]  596 25  PlugInKit                       0x0000000190e8a544 [PKService main]  60 26  PlugInKit                       0x0000000190e8a934 [PKService defaultRunarguments]  20 27  libextension.dylib              0x0000000195eacd88 NSExtensionMain  64 28  libdyld.dylib                   0x0000000196cb6a04 start  0 codepre

They included the following method example but did not state if this was meant to be an example within an Activity definition or a Fragment definition.  I was a little confused on this and wanted to ask for clearification.  based on the use of super it would suggest its inside the fragment getting passed up to the Activity, but this disagrees with their statement that the Activity gets called first.  If its meant to be an example in the Activity and super refers to the parent Application class, then I am not clear on how it gets referred back to the Fragment.

The documentation page says that the codepartialcode object must have the three attributes codefunccode, codeargscode, and codekeywordscode, so I can see why the above function definition inludes these, but I still dont see what tangible goal they accomplish. p

Negative 41325 pIm trying to style a nested list such that each level is displayed horizontally in its emownem container, with sublists then displayed horizontally in emsubsequentem containers at most one sublist will exist at each level, so the parent item can always be unambiguously indicated.p  pThe only way I can see to ensure that certain items namely those that come after a sibling with a sublist are in the correct row for their level rather than being rendered after the sublist is to remove sublists from normal flow with codeposition absolutecode.  This gets me pretty close to what I want, however I then need to move the sublist into positionbut its correct vertical position depends on the height of the container for its parent level for example, the parent level might contain so many items that the list wraps within its container and expands the height.p  pI know that I can move the sublist into position using JavaScript, but is there a pure CSS way of accomplishing what I want whether that involves some trickery by which an absolutelypositioned block can be positioned relative to another element, or else preventing siblings from appearing after blocks that precede them in normal flowp  pExample belowmdashp  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodecss langcss prettyprintoverridecode.container    width 600px   margin auto   position relative   ul    border 1px solid lightgrey   width 100   textalign center   padding 1em   .level2    backgroundcolor lightgrey   position absolute   left 0   margintop 2em   li    display inlineblock   padding 0.5em   margin 0.5em   border 1px dashed blue   texttransform uppercase   fontweight normal   .expanded    fontweight bold   textdecoration underline codepre pre classsnippetcodehtml langhtml prettyprintoverridecodeltdiv classcontainergt   ltul classlevel1gt     ltligtOneltligt     ltli classexpandedgt       Two       ltul classlevel2gt         ltligtAlphaltligt         ltligtBeta Gamma Deltaltligt         ltligtEpsilonltligt         ltligtZeta Eta Thetaltligt         ltligtIotaltligt       ltulgt     ltligt     ltligtThree Fourltligt     ltligtFive Six Sevenltligt     ltligtEight Nine Tenltligt     ltligtElevenltligt   ltulgt ltdivgtcodepre div div p

Negative 41325 pI am currently working on an application for tablets that uses a SQL Server Compact 3.5 database. The need has risen to sync data among tablets. After some research namely a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenussyncbb821992.aspx relnofollowthisa and a hrefhttpvisualstudiomagazine.comarticles20120601databasesynchronizationwiththemicrosoftsyncframework.aspx relnofollowthisa, my team and I decided to have a central database hosted by SQL Server 2008 R2.p  pAfter implementing a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryff928494vsql.110.aspx relnofollowthis examplea, there were several drawbacks to this approachp  ul lipI would like to synchronize the entire database, not just a subset of tables. This would require adding primary keys to tables that lack primary keys, let alone adding each table to the sync scope.pli lipDepending on the sync direction, either the server db hosted by SQL Server 2008 R2 or the client db SQL Server Compact 3.5 would have precedence, meaning one dbs data may overwrite data made by the other db.pli ul  pI believe a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarycc305322vsql.110.aspx relnofollowchange trackinga can be useful, and would like to leverage such, if applicable, to find a solution for the following scenariop  pThe server and three tables are currently synchronized with the same database in the db. p  precodeID  NAME  1   JIM 2   BOB 3   JANE codepre  pThe three tablets are taken offline to do their thing.p  pTablet 1 adds the followingp  precode4  JOE codepre  pTablet 2 adds the following assuming after tablet 1p  precode4  BILL codepre  pTablet 3 adds the following assuming after tablet 2p  precode4  DAVE codepre  pThen, the tablets reconnect online to sync, in any order. After all is said and done with synchronization, the server db and client dbs should have the following datap  precodeID  NAME  1   JIM 2   BOB 3   JANE 4   JOE 5   BILL 6   DAVE codepre  pFrom a DBA standpoint, there is a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms152746.aspx relnofollowmerge replicationa, but I do not have any sysadmin rights on the db server or administrative rights on a pc itself to give myself sysadmin rights in sql server. Thus, I would like to avoid this route if possible and stick with coding a solution using sync framework or better.p  pAm I on the right track after implementing the example above toward eventually finding a solution for my scenario, or is there something else I need to dop

Negative 41325 pWhen I was reading emThinking in Javaem 4th Edition recently, I got a problem about method binding in Java.

However, I read about some other articles, which said that Java use static binding when dealing with overloading. It seems contradictory because obviously statement 1 is overloading.li liI do not fully understand why Java called ovrLd of base class in statement 2. If it used dynamic binding, it should call overLd of sub class because by the runtime JVM should be clear that sub2 is an instance of BindingTestSub class. On the other hand, if it used static binding, it should also call overLd of sub class because compiler is able to observe that the type of given argument is an Integer. Can you tell me what job has been done by compiler or JVM when it deals with statement 2.li liThe outcome of statement 3 makes sense to me. But still, I am curious about how the compiler recognize it ovrRd as a overriding method. In another words, how does compiler know that there is another class which has a method that overrides this ovrRd. li ol  pAny thoughts about above questions or Java method binding mechanism is appreciated. Also please feel free to point out my mistakes. p

Negative 41325 pI am developing an android application that need to implement GCM push notification on it and in this application we are using 2 different server , one is development and another one is production. Now the scenario is that i am registering my project with Google Cloud Messaging through Google APIs Console. After successful registration, i have a project id and an Api key. For the generation of Api key it prompts me to add a IP address, at this time i simply add IP address of My development server. This makes my push notification running. But after completing my development work i shifts all of my server side code to Production server. Now My problem is that my push notification stops working. Did i need to change IP address of Development to Production in Api key generation  or Did i have to generate new Api key with Production server IP address or Does a single Project Id supports multiple Api keys with different IP addresses. Any suggestion or link will be helpful and appreciated. Thanks in advance.        p

Negative 41325 pIm relatively new to sentiment analysis and have been reading the excellent online tutorial by Stanford professor Christopher Potts. p  pIn a hrefhttpsentiment.christopherpotts.netclassifiers.htmlnumeric relnofollowhis tutorial under the section on machine learning classifiersa, he provides a brief discussion of a lightweight, accurate classifier and suggests the following stepsp  blockquote   ol   liBegin with a set of N fixed sentiment lexicons L. For my experiments, I used the fixed polarity lexicons, the IMDB scores, the   Experience Project OE vectors, and the sentimentrich classes from   the Harvard General Inquirer and LIWC. strongThe total number of   predictors was 39strong, all of them numeric.li   li...li   liFor a given text, the feature function simply sums up all the words scores for each of the strong39 predictorsstrong and then normalizes   them by the length of the text. Thus, each text is modeled as a vector   of 39 numbers.li   li...li   ol blockquote  pI am wondering where he got those 39 features from From my understanding, the lexicons have thousands of entries, resulting in thousands of features using a bagofwords model. How did he go from thousands of features to 39 features He must have obviously done some feature selection, but I cannot infer his methodology or selection criteria. p

Negative 41325 pOracle 10g  due to a compatibility issue with a 9i database, Im pulling data through a 10g database to be used by an 11g database using INSERT INTO...SELECT statements via a scheduled job that runs every 15 minutes. I notice that TRUNCATE statements are much faster than DELETE statements and have read that a downside to DELETE statements is that they never decrease the table highwater mark. My use for this data is purely readonly  UPDATEs and INSERTs are never issued against the tables in question.p  pGiven the above, I want to avoid the possible situation where my working database Oracle 11g attempts to read from a table on my staging database 10g that is empty for a period of time because the TRUNCATE happened straight away and the INSERT INTO...SELECT from the 9i database is taking a couple of minutes to complete.p  pSo, Im wondering if that is how Oracle handles TRUNCATEs within a transaction, or if the whole operation is performed and COMMITted, despite the fact that TRUNCATEs cant be rolled back Or, put another way, from an external SELECT point of view, if I wrap a TRUNCANTE and INSERT INTO...SELECT on a table in a transaction, will the table ever appear empty to an external SELECT reading from the tablep

Negative 41325 pI would like to use IndexedDB to store video files on client side for offline HTML5 app. To do so I download video in 2 chunks from server API. Then I store them in indexedDB as a blobs. Then on other page I get them from db and create new blob. Finally I create objectURL and assign it to video element as src. Code below show how I retrieve data and assign it to video element.

I can easily play and navigate through video. On mobile version I can start playing and navigate but only through first chunk of video. When video go to other part  with other chunk, player stops with black screen and error Cant play video appears. I believe it is a bug but maybe I do something wrong and there is any workaround for my problem. I tried to save blob made from chunks in db, then get it and assign to video src and it works, so I think there is a problem with Blob constructor in mobile version of Chrome. It is not a solution for me, because I store large objects and to do so I need 2x more storage. Storage is limited and I can not waste it like that  What is more I checked how this chunked blob looks on chromeblobinternals and on mobiledesktop version it looks nearly same, only paths are different.

Negative 41325 pWe have a Java web application that is instantiated using Guice and the Guice Servlet extension. The application also includes Quartz jobs that are also instantiated by Guice. I want to write unit test for these jobs.p  pThe job classes depend on other other classes from our productive code which require a codeProviderltHttpServletRequestgtcode. In the productive setup, the jobs can be successfully instantiated by Guice, and the jobs work as expected because they never call any code on their their collaborators that triggers a codegetcode on the servlet request provider. Such a codegetcode call would fail because the jobs are executed by some worker thread, and not as part of an HTTP request to the servlet.p  pNow my question is how to set up Guice in a JUnit test so that I get the same behaviour, i.e. the job classes can be instantiated, but all attempts to use any outofscope codeRequestScopedcode objects would fail.p  hr  pThere are two straigtforward solutions, but they dont work for me.p  pIf I dont bind any codeHttpServletRequestcode, I get an error when trying to instantiate the job in the test setupp  precodecom.google.inject.CreationException Guice creation errors  1 No implementation for javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest was bound.   while locating com.google.inject.Providerltjavax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequestgt codepre  pIf on the other hand I just bind mock instances, e.g. withp  precodeOverride protected void configure      bindHttpServletRequest.class.toInstancemockHttpServletRequest.class  codepre  pthen the job can be instantiated, but I no longer get a test error in case the job makes use of the servlet request instance.

Negative 41325 pHey guys i was planning out a directive i was making which would essentially be a popup with a timer on it. Basically the plan was to pass in an object which could configure the properties to construct the message. The directive would contain the html template and we would append the messagehtml based on the properties set in a service. For Examplep  precoderootScope.timer  recursive time fn goes here  obj   message  ltspan ngclickconnectgtCustom message goes here  timer  ltspangt   Popup.popobj codepre  petc. The point of the question is the coderootScopecode timer needs to tick down which is simple to do in a controller but the directive sets html as a string if interpolated and will not update the value if im correct. My question is how do i get the directive to render the timer ticking down inside the directive. would i need to use codecompilecode in the codedirectivecode if so how Furthermore how would i pass an codengclickcode function from this service if i ever needed one Sorry if its confusing pls ask questions.p

Negative 41325 pThird time I try to ask this question, maybe this time Ill be able to explain my problem better.p  pI have a multiprocess server with each process doing the accept avoiding the Thundering Herd problem with file locking, dont worry. Each process initialize a thread pool excpet the main one the manage the others. When the accept succeeds the file descriptor is passed to the thread pool and one of these threads is awakened by a pthreadcondsignal. After this, the process returns on the file locking waiting to pass through it so it can wait again on the accept. Meanwhile the thread reads the file descriptor and does its job reading the HTTP request and serving it in an infinite loop of readingserving in order to obtain HTTP persistentconnection. The loop will be broken only if an error occurs or if the timeout expires.p  pSo far so good. But something occurs right after a request is served correctly in fact, the first request is read and served entirely but when the thread restarts the cycle and enters the read cycle it remains stuck because it reads only few letters like GE or GET, insted of the entire request. If I remove the infinite cycle for the persistenconnection, each request is served by a different thread and no error occursp  pThis is the reading cyclep  precodefor    ssizet readn, writen  sizet nleft  char buff[BUFFSIZE]  char ptr  buff   errno  0   nleft  BUFFSIZE   whilenleft gt 0                                    I will read as much as I can using the MSGDONTWAIT flag making the call nonblocking      that means that or the call will succed or it will be closed by the other side      if readn  recvconnsd, ptr, nleft, MSGDONTWAIT lt 0             If the nonblocking recv fails, it could set errno with one of the following errorcode          if errno  EAGAIN  errno  EWOULDBLOCK                This check has been implemented due to an error that happened several times              The buffer was empty even if a new data was sent.

Negative 41325 pIn my macro I have a subroutine which using a for loop goes through the rows of a table and writes a comment in column V depending on what is in column S.  During this loop it also counts the number of times it says New in column S.  Now I want to pass this value up in to the main macro and down in to another subroutine.  How do I do this or is my approach here wrongp  pIf I understand correctly, its usually not possible to return values from subs in excel VBA, but you can from a function.  However I dont think a function would be suitable here I might be misunderstanding how functions work in VBA andor not realising their full potential.p  pSo how do I smuggle out the variablevalue from the sub and in to another one  Is the only option codeGlobalcode or codePubliccode declarationsp  pHeres a really rough example of my codep  precodeSub MainMacro    Call CommentSub   Call NumberOfRowsToCopy End sub  Sub CommentSub   Dim Counter As Integer   For Counter  1 to 500     If CellsCounter, S  New Then       NewOrderLineCounter  NewOrderLineCounter  1       CellsCounter, V.Select       ActiveCell.FormulaR1C1  New Line     End If   Next Counter End sub  Sub NumberOfRowsToCopy   ActiveSheet.RangeA12T1001.AutoFilter Field16, Criteria1      New   ActiveSheet.RangeB15N amp NewOrderLineCounter.SpecialCellsxlCellTypeVisible.Select End sub codepre  pBtw, Im aware that there maybe better ways to get the number of rows that need to be copied here thereby eliminating the need to pass values between subs but I think Ive tried all of them and none worked.  I think its the format of the excel sheet but thats another problem and you gotta work with what youre given, rightp

Negative 41325 pIm developing a Cordova app 5.1 with JQuery Mobile JQM. The app has a main menu with a 3x3 icon grid that leads to other JQM pages. On iOS7, when I touch one of the icons and go to a page different from the main menu, I can see the main menu page in the background this is almost invisible but the white parts of the menu icons are there.  In my code Im not using nothing related with transparency and the transitions are disabled. This doesnt happens in Android. The icons in the menu have the following CSS but I believe this is not causing the problemp  precode.glow imgactive       webkitfilter dropshadow0px 0px 10px rgba1,0,0,0.75  codepre  pAny suggestion about why this is happening Many thanks in advancep

Negative 41325 pI was trying to solve this tricky question, but for some reason my code is doing something wrong... I dont exactly know why, but Ill try to explain as much as I can.p  blockquote   pstrongConsecutive productsstrong    Write a program that reads a positive integer   from standard input and verifies if its equal to the product of three   natural and consecutive numbers. For example, the number 120 is equal   to 4x5x6, as for number 90 there arent any three consecutive natural   numbers whose product is 90. Your program should generate as output   S if there are 3 consecutive natural numbers whose product is the   value read, or N if none.p blockquote  precodeInput  120  Expected Output  S   Input  60  Expected Output  S   Input  80  Expected Output  N   Input  120  Expected Output  S codepre  pAnd this is my codep  precode include ltstdio.hgt int main     int int1,i,count10,j,k,w0     scanfi,ampint1     for i  1 i lt count i              for j  1 j lt count1 j                      for  k  1 k lt count2 k                              if ij1 ampamp ik2 ampamp ijkint1                     w1                                                 if w0              printfN          else         printfS       codepre  pSo basically what this does is I have 3 loops that will generate random numbers in a codekijcode form... and it checks if we are getting what we wantthe product of three natural and consecutive numbers .

Negative 41325 pIs there a RegEx to strip the first 50 words of a block of text, and if the last of those 50 words does not complete the current sentence, will then grab the remaining words up to the end of that sentencep
Negative 41325 pI have use html form for submit information with file upload, I want to upload file on server at predefined location, such as I select a file from our local system drive and upload it on my website when I submit form. I receive all form value in servlet java file with doPost method. p
Negative 41325 pThere seems to be no documentation on how to create a new Parse Object with a Relation with a hrefhttpsgithub.comParsePlatformParseReact relnofollowParseReactNativea using codeParseReact.Mutation.Createcode. I resorted to thisp  precodefunction createRowrelatedObject, data    ParseReact.Mutation.CreateobjectClass, data     .dispatch     .thenfunctionnewRow        ParseReact.Mutation.AddRelationnewRow, relationColumn, relatedObject       codepre  pWhich is creating the new codeobjectClasscode Parse Object, but the column coderelationColumncode doesnt display the relation with the given coderelatedObjectcode.p  pAny idea on how does can be done, preferably in one query with the codeParseReact.Mutation.Createcodep
Negative 41325 pFor example, I have the following relations.p  precodeSuppliers sid integer, sname string, address string Partspid integer, pname string, color string Catalog sid integer, pid integer, cost real codepre  pI write the following MYSQL query to find the sids of suppliers who supply only red parts.p  pExample 1p  precodeSELECT DISTINCT C.sid FROM Catalog C  WHERE C.sid NOT IN     SELECT C.sid FROM Catalog C      INNER JOIN Parts P ON p.pid  C.pid     WHERE P.color ltgt red  codepre  pExample 2p  precodeSELECT DISTINCT C.sid FROM Catalog C  WHERE C.sid NOT IN     SELECT C2.sid FROM Catalog C2      INNER JOIN Parts P ON p.pid  C2.pid     WHERE P.color ltgt red  codepre  pI would like to know if there is any difference bet. the above two query statements. If I want to reuse the same table twice in a nested query, do I have to name my table alias differently I assume that inner query gets executed first before the outer query so Example 1 should be correct, but I cannot be sure because example 2 is the way the professor taught. p
