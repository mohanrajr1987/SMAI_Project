Positive 1158 pI have an app written in QT that uses QTimer. Its basically a game and all the actions are controlled by the timer. Game includes the ability to increasedecrease the game speed. The code for increasing the speed isp  precode    timerValue  speedUpValue     if timerValue lt maxSpeed          timerValue  maxSpeed          timer gt setIntervaltimerValue  codepre  pcodespeedUpValuecodeand codemaxSpeedcode are constants. Almost the same code is used for decreasing the speed. The problem is that codesetIntervalcode resets the internal timer and therefore if you keep rapidly increasing or decreasing the speed game eventually never proceeds because coderemainingTimecode is constantly being reset. Is there a way to set coderemainingTimecode manually or change the interval without resetting it p

Positive 1158 pI received a smallish C dev package from a friend that was developed on Linux and  uses Qt3D. On Linux, one can just open the associated .pro file in QtCreator, hit build, then run, everything works fine.  When following the same steps on Win7, it builds and runs, but the executable cant find OpenGL.p  pTo solve this, do I need to compile Qt locally on Win7, adding the appropriate lopengl flag or equivalent, then point QtCreator to this local version and rebuild Or is there something else I need to do or be aware of.  Thank you very much in advance.p

Positive 1158 pI have an application in which I want to have strict separation between backend and frontendGUI.p  pThe backend is the application logic with cpp classes and the frontend are QML files with some cpp classes which mainly works as adapters to the backend.p  pNow I was wondering if it is okay to have classes derived from QAbstractModel in the backend form a design point of view.p  pMy first thought was that they should NOT belong to the backend because they are just a wrapper around some Qt Container classes to reflect their data in the GUI. So a pointer to the actual data can be injected and they should only be used in the frontend for displaying purpose but they should not be used anywhere in the backend.p  pThe Qt Container classes of course should belong to the backend.p  pNow I also need some conversion and utilities functions which act and maybe modifies the data of the containers. Therefore I wrote a handler class. But now it is starting to get tricky to keep everything in sync especially without getting bindingloops.p  pThe other solution would be to have a class derived from QAbstractModel which wraps the data and also have these conversion and utilities functions. They could then call the dataChanged etc. functions. Then I could use this class also in the backend. But would that be good design or should the backend be free of QAbstractModel derived classesp  pSince I find it quite difficult to express my issue clearly, I hope my question is understandable in some way p

Negative 1158 pDifficult question. The answer is probably no, if all I found in the Intertubes is right, but it is worth a try. I need to override the kbdCtrlkbd  kbdShiftkbd  kbdEsckbd and the kbdCtrlkbd  kbdEsckbd combinations.

Negative 1158 pWe are using standard asp.net forms authentication.  Certain pages require a user to be logged in and least some of these pages are delivered by https.  There is a search control at the top of each page.  When this is used, we dont care whether the users session has expired, even if the current page requires a log in.  p  pHowever, currently, when performing the search, the builtin forms authentication sees that the page being posted to requires authentication and redirects the user to the login page, with the previous page, emnot the search results pageem as the referrer.p  pWhat is the best way of bypassing the security here  I have considered posting to a different page using the PostBackUrl property, but if this is not https you get the you are posting data to an unsecure connection message, which users dont like.p  pThanks for any help.p  pEdit thanks Nick for your suggestion of using a GET on the search page.  We are doing this already, but the query string is constructed by the search input control then redirects.

Negative 1158 pI would like to know how .NET teams out there are handling assembly reference paths when not everybody can immediately upgrade to a x64 operating system. The key issue right now is x64 versions of Windows will plant 32bit installations into CProgram Files x86 instead of the regular CProgram Files. This means many extra components and frameworks from 3rd parties end up in CProgram Files x86.p  pSo when one downloads source projects createdmodified in a x86 workstation onto a x64 workstation, there is some modification work required to get the reference paths correct. Quite typically, x64 users may save the modification and commit their preferences back into the version control repository, breaking the rhythm of the x86 users.p  pWhat are some good approaches to maintain harmony in a varied teamp

Negative 1158 pI am creating the model for a web application. The tables have ID fields as primary keys. My question is whether one should define ID as a property of the classp  pI am divided on the issue because it is not clear to me whether I should treat the object as a representation of the table structure or whether I should regard the table as a means to persist the object.p  pIf I take the former route then ID becomes a property because it is part of the structure of the database table, however if I take the latter approach then ID could be viewed as a peice of metadata belonging to the database which is not strictly a part of the objects model.p  pAnd then we arrive at the middle ground. While the ID is not really a part of the object Im trying to model, I do realise that the the objects are retrieved from and persisted to the database, and that the ID of an object in the database is critical to many operations of the system so it might be advantageous to include it to ease interactions where an ID is used.p  pIm a solo developer, so Id really like some other, probably more experienced perspectives on the issuep

Negative 1158 pI have a Windows Form and a class with two simple methods that run recursively in a nondeterministic way meaning that its unknown which recursion will be called, both can call the other... Now, there are some points during that recursion at which I want to pause the execution and wait for a user to click on the Next Step button. Only after the button is pressed should the recursive functions continue. The class runs on a separate thread so it doesnt block the UI.p  pDuring that pause, the Form would simply retrieve the value from the class and display it in a listbox. Then after the button is pressed, the recursion continues until the next Pause. I need this so the user can see what is happening in the recursion step by step. Also I need to be able to put Pause anywhere in the recursive method even multiple times without causing any sideeffects...p  pThe only way that comes to my mind is to call Pause method in which a loop checks some locked flag and then sleeps for some time the button would then set the flag, but I had some bad experiences with Thread.Sleep in Windows Forms locking the UI so I am looking at another options.p  pIs there any clean way to do thisp

Negative 1158 pI was wondering if anyone knew the proper way to send an SMS message to an email address using Verizons CDMA Motorola Droid phone. p  pThe internal messaging application appears to automagically do this. While 3rd party applications like SMSPopup dont seem to be able to properly reply to email addresses unless you compose the message inside the messaging application. p  pWhen the internal messaging application sends a SMS message theres a corresponding codeRILREQUESTCDMASENDSMScode entry in the logcat codeadb logcat b radiocode. When you send a SMS to an email address it prints the same thing, so behind the scenes it looks as though it is sending an sms. The interesting thing is that if you look at the content provider sent box the messages are addressed to various 1270XXXXXXXXX numbers.p  pOn other services you can send email addresses by sending a SMS to a predefined short sms number. And then formatting your SMS as emailaddress subject message i.e. a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiSMSgatewayCarrierProvidedSMStoEMailGateways relnofollowhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiSMSgatewayCarrierProvidedSMStoEMailGatewaysap  pFor example, using Tmobiles number 500 you can send a SMS to an email using the followingp  precodeSmsManager smsMgr  SmsManager.getDefault smsMgr.sendTextMessage500, null, usernamedomain.com message sent to an email address from a SMS, null, null codepre  pDoes anyone know if p  ul liIt is possible to programatically send SMS to email messages from a CDMA Android phoneli liDoes Verizon actually send your replies as SMS messages or are they actually sent as MMS or normal http email messagesli liAny ideas about how to intercept what the raw message being sent to see whats going onli ul  pIt might be possible that Verizon somehow generates a fake number temporarily tied to an email address since repeated messages are not sent to the same number.

Negative 1158 pIm currently exploring Broadcast Receivers and Broadcast Intent.  There are some aspects of the tutorials which are ambiguous to me.  To my knowledge this is how the process works.  I can broadcast an intent from my application and any receiver on the phone can act on that intent as long as the actions match.  I can register a broadcaster receiver on anything that extends Context and when I do so I must provide a filter which will allow the receiver to act on one or more intent actions.p  pThe part which confuses me is defining a receiver via the manifest.  Must the name of said receiver match a class name  Why should I ever define an intent filter with an action in the project manifest if I always have to provide another intent filter when I register my receiver in codep  pIf anyone has a good tutorial or example of the best way to use broadcast receivers and how I should define them I would appreciate it.p

Negative 1158 pIve got some UI code that looks like thisp  precodetry      SomeClass classInstance  new SomeClasssomeId  catch Exception exception       Content wasnt created, show a message, stop processing     return  codepre  pIt seems the try catch was added because the constructor for SomeClass would bomb out if the someId it receives isnt valid, and data couldnt be found in a DB.p  pRunning this code through FXCop recently, it warns against using the general Exception, but all SomeClass does is throw a new Exception with a message to say it failed to initialize.p  pI guess the problem is that the class constructor should have its own custom exception, which I could then handle in my UI, but I wonder what else I could do to the code above to handle the exception, that meets FXCop requirementsp

Negative 1158 pThe JDK docs say, that if a thread is interrupted that currently blocks in an io operation of an InterruptibleChannel, the channel is closed and a ClosedByInterruptException is thrown. However, i get a different behaviour when using a FileChannelp  precodepublic class Main implements Runnable   public static void mainString[] args throws Exception      Thread thread  new Threadnew Main     thread.start     Thread.sleep500     thread.interrupt     thread.join   public void run      try          readFile      catch IOException ex          ex.printStackTrace        private void readFile throws IOException      FileInputStream in  new FileInputStreamlargefile     FileChannel channel  in.getChannel     ByteBuffer buffer  ByteBuffer.allocate0x10000     for           buffer.clear          Thread.currentThread.interrupt         int r  channel.readbuffer         if Thread.currentThread.isInterrupted              System.out.printlnthread interrupted             if channel.isOpen                 System.out.printlnchannel closed                  if r lt 0             break       codepre  pp  pHere, when the thread is interrupted, the read call returns normally even so the channel has been closed. No exception is thrown. This code prints thread interrupted and channel closed, and then on the next call to read it throws a ClosedChannelException.p  pI wonder wether this behaviour is allowed. As i understand the docs, the read should either return normally and not close the channel or close the channel and throw ClosedByInterruptException. Returning normally and closing the channel does not seem right. The trouble for my application is, that i get an unexpected and seemingly unrelated ClosedChannelException somewhere else, when a FutureTask that does io gets cancelled.p  pNote The ClosedByInterruptException will get thrown as expected, when the thread is already interrupted when entering the read.p  pI have seen this behaviour using the 64Bit ServerVM JDK 1.6.0 u21, Windows 7. Can anyone confirm thisp

The primary segment spool gets a row at a time from the segment iterator and inserts it into a work table in tempdb. Once it gets the flag saying that a new group has started it returns a row to the top input of the nested loops operator. This causes the stream aggregate to be invoked over the rows in the work table, the average is computed then this value is joined back with the rows in the work table before the work table is truncated ready for the new group. The segment spool emits a dummy row in order to get the final group processed.p  pAs far as I understand the worktable is a heap or it would be denoted in the plan as an index spool. However when I try and replicate the same process it only needs 11 logical reads.p  precodeCREATE TABLE WorkTable         OrderID    INT,      CustomerID NCHAR5 NULL,      Freight    MONEY NULL,     DECLARE Average MONEY  PRINT Insert 3 Rows  INSERT INTO WorkTable VALUES      1, NALFKI, 29.46 Scan count 0, logical reads 1  INSERT INTO WorkTable VALUES      2, NALFKI, 61.02 Scan count 0, logical reads 1  INSERT INTO WorkTable VALUES      3, NALFKI, 23.94 Scan count 0, logical reads 1 PRINT Calculate AVG  SELECT Average  AvgFreight FROM   WorkTable Scan count 1, logical reads 1 PRINT Return Rows  With the average column included  This convoluted query is just to force a nested loops plan SELECT  FROM   SELECT Average AS AvgFreight T Scan count 1, logical reads 1        OUTER APPLY WorkTable WHERE  COALESCEFreight, OrderID IS NOT NULL        AND Average IS NOT NULL  PRINT Clear out work table  TRUNCATE TABLE WorkTable  PRINT Insert 1 Row  INSERT INTO WorkTable VALUES      4, NANATR, 39.92 Scan count 0, logical reads 1 PRINT Calculate AVG  SELECT Average  AvgFreight FROM   WorkTable Scan count 1, logical reads 1 PRINT Return Rows  With the average column included  SELECT  FROM   SELECT Average AS AvgFreight T Scan count 1, logical reads 1        OUTER APPLY WorkTable WHERE  COALESCEFreight, OrderID IS NOT NULL        AND Average IS NOT NULL  PRINT Clear out work table  TRUNCATE TABLE WorkTable  PRINT Insert 1 Row  INSERT INTO WorkTable VALUES      5, NANTON, 22.00 Scan count 0, logical reads 1 PRINT Calculate AVG  SELECT Average  AvgFreight FROM   WorkTable Scan count 1, logical reads 1 PRINT Return Rows  With the average column included  SELECT  FROM   SELECT Average AS AvgFreight T Scan count 1, logical reads 1        OUTER APPLY WorkTable WHERE  COALESCEFreight, OrderID IS NOT NULL        AND Average IS NOT NULL  PRINT Clear out work table  TRUNCATE TABLE WorkTable  PRINT Calculate AVG  SELECT Average  AvgFreight FROM   WorkTable Scan count 1, logical reads 0 PRINT Return Rows  With the average column included  SELECT  FROM   SELECT Average AS AvgFreight T        OUTER APPLY WorkTable WHERE  COALESCEFreight, OrderID IS NOT NULL        AND Average IS NOT NULL  DROP TABLE WorkTable  codepre
Negative 1158 pWhenever I use Console in Chromes Developer Tools or Firebug to interpret a jQuery selector, it only returns the innerHTML of the result of the selector if only one item matches.  If multiple items match, Im given the array of matched items, with their innerHTML as the contents of each array slot.  However, in Safari, a navigable tree representing the actual returned jQuery object is presented.  This is far easier to work with when looking for properties I want to getset, etc.  I can get similar output in Firebug or Chrome Developer Tools if I pass the selector to a codeconsole.logcode call, but this is a pain.

Negative 1158 pWhat is the best way to convert types in a Struts2 applicationp  pRight now I want to create a CRUD for a certain hibernate entity in my application.  Say I wanted to change the codeAccountcode that a codeUsercode is associated with. I can just pass in the parameter codeuser.account.idcode with a specific value, provided that I have all of the proper getterssetters.p  pThis works perfectly fine when creating an object for the first time, where the account would be null. This makes ognl create a new account object, and set the id to what was passed in.p  pThe problem happens when trying to change the encapsulated codeAccountcode object. Using the same codeuser.account.idcode parameter, ognl interprets this as codegetUser.getAccount.setIdparamcode. Hibernate interprets this as an attempt to change the primary key.p  pI understand why it does this, I am just wondering if there is  better way for handling this case. This is very common in our application, and I dont want to have to keep creating multiple objects and marshaling them over before I save them via hibernate.p  pDoes anyone no a better way to solve this problem in struts2p

Negative 1158 pI am trying to achieve the following for a parameterized hudson job when a user clicks on build now he should be presented with three drop down list parameters viz., Environment, Server, Port.

Negative 1158 pIm building a project that uses an HID OEM75 as the access point for a locking mechanism.  Were doing our control through an Arduino Duemilanove ATmega328.  Were working with a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiSerialPeripheralInterfaceBus relnofollowSPIa for the security and apparently support.  I realize that any RFID chip has pretty weak security.p  pIm currently struggling with receiving bytes via SPI from the card reader.p  pThe card reader is in autonomous read mode, meaning it reads a card, sends a signal to the Arduino via a card present line, separate from SPI, which tells the Arduino to pull the Slave Select line high to activate the transfer cycle from the card reader.  This is where I run into trouble, I cant understand how I can get the Arduino to simply read the bytes coming in from the card reader without sending any command bytes to the card readerp  pThe default command structure, SPI.transfer0x00, sends a byte in this case the dummy byte 0x00 and then accepts a byte from the source, but because our source is operating autonomously, it wont accept the dummy byte and that will actually mess up its operation.p  pTo word it simply how can we accept a string of bytes from the slave source without sending bytes from the Master Source, using Arduinos SPI libraryp
Negative 1158 pI use auto generated EntityFramework Data Model for a Database that has 100 tables. Though I use only 5 tables I select all tables to be mapped onto c classes. p  pEvery time I start dekstop application that creates DataContext instance in FormLoad event it takes 34 seconds for some inner EF initialization. This startup time strongly depends on number of autogenerated classes. When I decided to generate mapping only for 5 tables  start up time decreased dramatically. p  pI wonder what is going on behind the scenes and can I change standard behavior keeping all unused table mappings in a program I dont want to care what tables do I need to be mapped. I guess EF does some reflection work, may it be done in lazyload style or some of a kind p  pThank you in advance p

Negative 1158 pSo I decided I want my image names stored in mysql. So I would save the 1 in  in my mysql database.p  pNow so far I intend to name my iamges in just numbers, in autoincrement actually. But should I name my image Because I heard mysql can be rather slow, and I dont want a bunch of images names in my database if its going to make my database run that much slower. Especially since image names really arent that important.p  pAlso, would autoincrement make my database run faster, as opposed to manual numberingp  pEDIT Totally unrelated question. I notice some peoplesites separate their images into smaller chunks. Like something that could easily be one image, is separated into multiple image files I dont get that, especially since amazon image hositng service charge per get. As in amazon charges per picture too. So why do people split up images I have my assumptions but Im sure theres more to it.p

Negative 1158 pI have a table in which there is a bitwise column representing a list of statuses that can be attached to an entry. Each entry can have multiple statuses selected hence the use of the bitwise logic.p  pWhat Id like to do is pull a query that will tell me how many entires there are for each status i.e. how many times each bit is turned on. The difficulty I have is that there is of course overlap so a GROUP BY or a DISTINCT is not going to cut it as far as I can see.p  pAs an example lets just have two values, 1 and 2. and the following datap  precodeId  Status 1  1 2  1 3  2 4  3 codepre  pNow, I want to count how many entries there are for each bit so Id like something that counts that 3 value into both the 1 and 2 totals, outputting something like thisp  precodeBit  Count 1  3 2  2 codepre  pThe closest I can get so far seems to be pulling out the distinct values and then adding those with multiple entries into their corresponding counts using PHP. Obviously, Id like to do something a bit more elegant.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 1158 pIve been searching the interweb for two days, but have not been able to figure this out. I am making a webpage with loads of included php files, and I have been asked to make a footer with contact information etc.p  pThe problem is that i cant get the footer to stick to the bottom, and I have discovered that its because the body doesnt extend all the way to the bottom of the page.p
Negative 1158 pMany of the servers in our environment have their loopback line in strongcodeetchostscodestrong configured like sop  precode127.0.0.1        mydevserver.testdomain.com mydevserver localhost.localdomain localhost codepre  pNormally, this is not an issue.  However, we are now dealing with some external software from a vendor that calls gethostbyaddr and their installer is designed to fail if the result of strongcodehostname ipaddresscodestrong is 127.0.0.1.  This of course causes it to fail on our systems because the servers hostname is in the loopback line of codeetchostscode.p  pMy question is, if I wrap the installer in a bash or perl script, is there a way to mask or temporarily alter the results of strongcodehostname ipaddresscodestrong without changing the etchosts filep  pClarification They are calling the gethostbyaddr function from within their compiled binary installer. The way to get a similar result from command line is codehostname ipaddresscodep

Negative 1158 pI have been thinking a little about environment variables and have a few questionsobservations.p  ul lipputenvchar stringp  pThis call seems fatally flawed.  Because it doesnt copy the passed string you cant call it with a local and there is no guarantee a heap allocated string wont be overwritten or accidentally deleted.  Furthermore though I havent tested it, since one use of environment variables is to pass values to childs environment this seems useless if the child calls one of the exec functions.  Am I wrong in thatpli lipThe linux man page indicates that glibc 2.02.1.1 abandoned the above behavior and began copying the string but this led to a memory leak that was fixed in glibc 2.1.2.  Its not clear to me what this memory leak was or how it was fixed.pli lipsetenv copies the string but I dont know exactly how that works.  Space for the environment is allocated when the process loads but it is fixed.  Is there some arbitrary convention at work here  For example, allocating more slots in the env string pointer array than currently used and moving the null terminating pointer down as needed  Is the memory for the new copied string allocated in the address space of the envivronment itself and if it is too big to fit you just get ENOMEM pli lipConsidering the above issues, is there any reason to prefer putenv over setenvpli ul  pThanks for your help.p

Negative 1158 pI am building an application that will enable users to connect to the same server. Rather than the applicationdevice using its own certificateprivate key, it is important to ensure that each user has their own certificateprivate key to use for encryption. p  pNow I know, from the OpenSSL website documents, that their internal certificate store of OpenSSL can hold one certificatekey pair for the RSA cipher. My question is thisp  pPresume I have a SSL struct named strongssl1strong that I created from my SSLCTX where I didnt set the certificatekey to use in the SSLCTX thus not inheriting the certificatekey. I then go on to set the certificatekey for strongssl1strong that is associated with some user. Then suppose I have another SSL struct named strongssl2strong created from the same SSLCTX. I then go on to set the certificatekey for strongssl2strong that is associated with a different user than the first one. p  pIf at this point I call the SSLconnect API on strongssl1strong will it use the certificatekey I set for strongssl2strong I ask since the store says it only holds one certkey pair and I loaded the certkey for strongssl2strong last, thus I presume it would overwrite the one I loaded first for strongssl1strong.p  pThanks for reading my post. I appreciate any helpwisdompointers you can provide.p

To be more precise, I will post the task of the homework I am trying to achievep  precodeWork 2 An abstract class is not a complete class, it misses some parts, and you cannot create     objects from it. The programmer who writes the derived classes must fill in the missing    parts. Consider an abstract class Vehicle. Derive two hierarchies from this class as it  is shown below Now, write 4 classes, see the yellow rectangle. Start from the abstract  base class Vehicle gt Vehicle with 4 wheels gt Sport Cars and stop at the derived class Rally, which is the most specific  class. The class Vehicle contains a field which holds the vehicle name and an abstract  method void Display.  Implement this function in the derived classes, so that the function returns  information about the vehicle, e.g. the motor power and other necessary properties. The  last derived class has private fields to hold the motor power, the car weight, the car  acceleration, the highest speed and a function that computes the specific power power   weight. The function Display returns a text string with all this information. Test  your work in a Console application that uses objects of the type of the classes Sport  car and Rally. codepre  pClass Vehiclep  precodeusing System using System.Collections.Generic using System.Linq using System.Text  namespace Awork2  public abstract class Vehicle      public string vehicleName     public abstract void Display    codepre  pClass Vehicle4Wheelsp  precodeusing System using System.Collections.Generic using System.Linq using System.Text  namespace Awork2  public class Vehicle4Wheels  Vehicle      public override void Display               Console.WriteLineCar1        codepre  pClass SportCarp  precodeusing System using System.Collections.Generic using System.Linq using System.Text  namespace Awork2  public class SportCar  Vehicle4Wheels      public override void Display              Console.WriteLineDerived222 class Constructor.        codepre  pClass Rallyp  precodeusing System using System.Collections.Generic using System.Linq using System.Text  namespace Awork2  public class Rally  SportCar      private double motorPower  408     private double carWeight  2380     private double carAcceleration  4.7     private double highestSpeed  250      public double SpecificPower              double specificPower  motorPower  carWeight         return specificPower           public override void Display              Console.WriteLineThe acceleration is 0.nThe highest speed is 1 kmh., carAcceleration, highestSpeed        Console.WriteLineSpecific power is 0, SpecificPower          codepre  pI am not sure how to achieve the goal of the task with abstract methods.

Negative 1158 pstrongThoughtsstrongp  pI imagine that in .NET, the underlying math with dates is done with Ticks.  If that were the case, I would think it wouldnt matter how far away two dates are when determining the difference between them.  You would simply subtract the Ticks and then do a series of divisions to convert the result from Ticks to days.  I dont see how two closer dates would make that faster, or how further dates would slow it down. Am I missing somethingp  pOn the SQL side......I have no idea. I imagine it is similar, but I have no proof of it.p  pstrongExampleContextstrongp  pLets say I have a function that if given a start date, end date, and time period in days for this example, it will tell me how many times that period can occur in the given date range.p  precodesomefunctionltfirst of this yeargt, ltfirst of last yeargt, lt30 daysgt returns 12 codepre  pOne bad way to implement this function is to start at the start date, then keep adding the time period e.g. 30 days and check to see if you have passed your end date.  However, this gets slower the wider your date range is.p  pAnother way is to figure out how many days are in the date range and divide by the number of days in your time period. In .NET, you can subtract the start and end dates and get a codeTimeSpancode back.  In SQL, you can use the codeDateDiffcode function to do just about the same thing.p  pMy question is if these other methods suffer from the same problem as the first.   Specifically strongWould it be faster to calculate the difference between two dates  that are close or does it make no difference at allstrongp  pstrongEdit  Why did I ask thisstrongp  pWas the performance for finding the difference between two dates really a problem I ran intop  pYes with an asterisk. In one of our apps, a calculation was being made that took .3 seconds and usually had to be made 30 times or so.  The users were less than thrilled, so I tried to see where we could speed things up.  I traced the problem to a function whose purpose was to find the difference between two dates.  Rather than just subtracting them, it iterated over all the dates between start and end, and kept a running total...really.  While switching the function over to just using subtraction and date diff in SQL there was similar code in the database I saw that there were processes that ran every night to generate a number closer to today for the calculation to use.  I asked this question to see if there was any value in continuing to let those processes run, and use the value they generate, or just use the original start date.  I now feel very comfortable putting those processes to rest.  Thank you all for your answers.p

Now, on devices that are declared as emlargeem or greater, instead of switching between activities I have one activity that removes and adds new fragments as requested. This choice was taken as the lefthand side of the screen allways displays the same content, so instead of adding this content ito all activities I instead change the fragments.p  pThe problem here is that while the intentfilter launches the correct activity on the phone, this activity should never be launched on a tablet. Instead, I would like to handle this URL in the fragment. As of now, I see no way of fixing this.

Another thought was to somehow add the intentfilter on the fragment, but this would not work as a fragment cannot launch without an activity hosting it.p  pstrongIn shortstrong On a phone, I need one activity to handle the intentfilter, but on a tablet I need another activity to handle the intentfilter.p  pIs there any way of accomplishing thisp

They transition like sop  precodeifaccountCreateView  nil      UINib nib  [UINib nibWithNibNameNewAccountView bundlenil]     NSArray nibViews  [nib instantiateWithOwnerself optionsnil]     accountCreateView  [nibViews objectAtIndex0]   [UIView transitionFromViewdisplayingLoginView  loginView  accountCreateView                     toViewdisplayingLoginView  accountCreateView  loginView                   duration0.6                    optionsdisplayingLoginView                               UIViewAnimationOptionTransitionFlipFromRight                              UIViewAnimationOptionTransitionFlipFromLeft                 completionBOOL finished                      if finished                          displayingLoginView  displayingLoginView                                       ] codepre  pThis works fine too. However the code that does animation of the views does not. When a text field becomes active the code to check proximity of the text field to the keyboard is called but nothing happens when the animation block executes.p  pSo I checkedp  precodeif[UIView areAnimationsEnabled]     NSLogAnimations are enabled else      NSLogAnimations are disabled codepre  pAnimations are certainly enabled.p  pSo I moved it back further to viewDidLoad, trying a simple animation to see what works, before anything elsep  precodeCGRect viewFrame  loginNameTextField.frame viewFrame.origin.y  400.f [UIView animateWithDuration1.f                        delay0.f                      optionsUIViewAnimationOptionCurveEaseInOut                   animations                       loginNameTextField.frame  viewFrame                                    completionNULL] codepre  pThis works fine Text field moves slowly down the window.p  pThis does nothing, and that is the confusing partp  precodeCGRect viewFrame  self.view.frame viewFrame.origin.y  400.f [UIView animateWithDuration1.f                        delay0.f                      optionsUIViewAnimationOptionCurveEaseInOut                   animations                       self.view.frame  viewFrame                                    completionNULL] codepre  pviewFrame when set from self.view.frame has origin 0,20 and size 320,460 as expected.p  pI tried setting the frame property directlyp  precodeCGRect viewFrame  self.view.frame viewFrame.origin.y  400.f self.view.frame  viewFrame codepre  pLooks like I can change the frame of subviews of self.view but not of self.view. A fix might be to leave the initial view controller as a blank view in the storyboard and create xibs for both the login view and create user view and load them in viewDidLoad  but whyp  pedit Yes, switching the storyboard version of the view controller to a plain empty view and adding the view containing the actual UI from a xib as a subview does make animations work again. Still dont know why though.p

Negative 1158 pIve checked a couple of solutions, saw you can set it in the storyboard but to set the icon you have to set it as a default identifier, and doing so removes the title and sets the default one, if you set the title to your own title it reverts to custom and no icon image once again. p  pId like to use the default iOS icon images for this, instead of downloading some images off the web.p  pI also tried to set it up in the AppDelegate in didFinishLaunching by getting the TabBar by accessing the rootViewController, but it gives me an undefined selector error when setting the tab bar items.

Negative 1158 pSeeking some advice, best practice etc...  p  pTechnology C .NET4.0, Winforms, 32 bitp  pI am seeking some advice on how I can best tackle large data processing in my C Winforms application which experiences high memory usage working set and the occasional OutOfMemory exception.p  pThe problem is that we perform a large amount of data processing inmemory when a shoppingbasket is opened. strongIn simplistic terms when a shoppingbasket is loaded we perform the following calculationsstrongp  ol lipFor each item in the shoppingbasket retrieve its historical price going all the way back to the date the item first appeared instock could be two months, two years or two decades of data. Historical price data is retrieved from text files, over the internet, any format which is supported by a price plugin.    pli lipFor each item, for each day since it first appeared instock calculate various metrics which builds a historical profile for each item in the shoppingbasket.pli ol  pThe result is that we can potentially perform hundreds, thousand andor millions of calculations depending upon the number of items in the shoppingbasket. If the basket contains too many items we run the risk of hitting a OutOfMemory exception.p  pstrongA couple of caveatsstrongp  ol lipThis data needs to be calculated for each item in the shoppingbasket and the data is kept until the shoppingbasket is closed.pli lipEven though we perform steps 1 and 2 in a background thread, speed is important as the number of items in the shoppingbasket can greatly effect overall calculation speed.pli lipMemory is salvaged by the .NET garbage collector when a shoppingbasket is closed. We have profiled our application and ensure that all references are correctly disposed and closed when a basket is closed.pli lipAfter all the calculations are completed the resultant data is stored in a IDictionary. CalculatedData is a class object whose properties are individual metrics calculated by the above process.pli ol  pstrongSome ideas Ive thought aboutstrong  p  pObviously my main concern is to reduce the amount of memory being used by the calculations however the volume of memory used can only be reduced if Ibr 1 reduce the number of metrics being calculated for each day orbr 2 reduce the number of days used for the calculation.  p  pBoth of these options are not viable if we wish to fulfill our business requirements.p  ul lipMemory Mapped Filesbr One idea has been to use memory mapped files which will store the data dictionary. Would this be possiblefeasible and how can we put this into placepli lipUse a temporary databasebr The idea is to use a separate not inmemory database which can be created for the lifecycle of the application. As shoppingbaskets are opened we can persist the calculated data to the database for repeated use, alleviating the requirement to recalculate for the same shoppingbasket.  pli ul  pAre there any other alternatives that we should consider What is best practice when it comes to calculations on large data and performing them outside of RAMp  pAny advice is appreciated....p

Negative 1158 pi have read many different sites and many different solutions that deal with timezones and server times and clientuser local time, etc., but no one explains in detail this exact situation im trying to accomplish.p  pi have this php code that makes something expire at a certain date and time, and it works great, but it only makes the content expire at the servers time.  i want it to expire on all time zones when that time comes for that time zone.  i dont want the content to expire at the same time for all time zones.p  pso lets say i want something to expire at 2pm, the very first timezone that hits 2pm they shouldnt be able to see the expired content, but the rest of the time zones should still be able to see it.  then when the 2nd timezone hits 2pm, that timezone shouldnt see the content.  so now 2 timezones cant see the content but the rest of the time zones should still see it.  and this continues one timezone at a time until all the timezones have hit 2pm.p  pplease tell me how to adjust this php to make the above happen.p  precodeltphp enddate  strtotime0200pm April 1, 2012 now  time if enddate lt now  gt different content to display after date and time has arrived, or dont put anything here if you just want expired content to disappear and nothing else to take its place. ltphp  else  gt content to display while the date and time hasnt arrived yet. ltphp  gt codepre

Negative 1158 pI have a solution which consists, to put it simply, a Windows Forms Application project and a Class Library, both in C. My library project was named codeOldNamecode. Thus the namespace was also codeOldNamecode and the generated file was codeOldName.dllcode.p  pI wanted to change the name, so I went into Properties, and changed the Assembly Name from codeOldNamecode to codeNewNamecode.p  pBuilding now generates a codeNewName.dllcode. However, the moment my application tries to access this dll, I get a codeSystem.Runtime.Serialization.SerializationExceptioncode the dll contains my methods for binaryserializing some stuff It claims that codeUnable to find assembly OldName, Version1.0.0.0, Cultureneutral, PublicKeyTokennull.codeProcmon.exe confirms that it is looking for the old dll codeNAME NOT FOUNDcode.p  pNow the strange thing is, if I copy the codeNewName.dllcode and rename it to codeOldName.dllcode, so that I have codeOldName.dllcode and codeNewName.dllcode, the problem persists. If I delete codeNewName.dllcode and only leave codeOldName.dllcode, the program crashes at launch with codeSystem.IO.FileNotFoundException Could not load file or assembly NewName, Version1.0.0.0, Cultureneutral, PublicKeyTokennull or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified.code This time, Procmon.exe reports that it failed a codeCreateFileMappingcode operation on codeOldName.dllcode because codeFILE LOCKED WITH ONLY READERScode, but it seems it gets the same thing on codeNewName.dllcode.p  pChanging the Assembly Name back to codeOldNamecode fixes everything, but of course then the file name becomes codeOldNamecode and I dont want that.p  pI cant for the life of me figure out where else it references the old assembly name. What could I be missingp  pstrongSOLUTIONstrong My program allows the user to create a file, and then save it to the disk using serialization with the methods in my dll. It also Allows loading the file. Being lazy, I had made a test file once, and kept reusing it. Turns out, as Tigran suggested, the old Assembly name still appeared inside the serialized data file, so when I attempted to load it from my program I was getting an exception because it couldnt find the assembly referenced emin the serialized fileem.p

The problem is in the way the AutoSuggest plugin stores the accumulated values temporarily until you execute a submit operation.  As far as I can tell it does not provide a direct property to get the accumulated values from it.  Instead it manipulates the DOM tree and creates a hidden text element with an ID that contains a randomly generated numeric suffix as per the AutoSuggest description web page.  Heres an examplep  precodeltinput typehidden classasvalues nameasvalues067 idasvalues067 valuerobotics,monkeys,gt codepre  pNote the randomly generated suffix for the ID attribute asvalues067.p  pTo get to the element so I can get the emvalueem attribute and bring the accumulated values into my Delphi 6 code I am doing a full DOM node tree scan to find the visible node element created by AutoSuggest using the NAME attribute of my original AutoSuggest edit box editEvernoteTagsp  pp  pThen I extract the numeric suffix from the ID attribute em67 in the above exampleem, and then search for the hidden text element using the that value appended to the string asvalues.

Negative 1158 pIve been writing an IRC chatbot that checks Google Voice for SMS messages then relays them to the chatroom through a socket on port 6667. The chat message processing runs in the main sub, in an infinite loop, while the GV checking is done in a separate process.

Negative 1158 pI have a peculiar situation. p  pAt one instant, I needed to branch, so I made a copy of my eclipse workspace and began working on two 2 parallel versions of the same project.p  pDevelopment is done on a Windows workstation. For testing purposes, the application is deployed onto a Linux server.p  pIf I run codemvn jettyruncode or codemvn clean compilecode for either project on the Windows workstation, everything works fine. The projects use identical codepom.xmlcode so there is no difference.p  pHowever, if I transfer the source code onto the Linux server, only old branch compiles 100 and the new branch compiles something like 45 meaning if I run it, it will give quite many complaints of codeClassNotFoundExceptioncode...p  pThe strange part is thatp  ul liboth projects are practically identical, copies of each other, 98li liencoding UTF8 for Java, no strange nonalphabet filenamesli limvn compiles without error, it says BUILD SUCCESSFUL on both projectsli lihowever, after compilation looking into the codetargetclassecodes of the newer project, there are code.classcode files missing for which there are code.javacode files in its respective codesrcmainjavacode pathli liI have tried javac with verbose and nowarn and such parameters, no differenceli lijdk 1.633li ul  pIs very confusing. Now what I have to do is compile the source on Windows workstation and copy the targetclasses contents onto the Linux server, but seems really unnecessary. The only thing that comes into my mind is that the newer version is using some heavy bleedingedgegenerics, but if that would hurt I would assume that a same result on Windows as Linux, b some error message. But nothing, just BUILD SUCCESSFUL with lots of missing .class files.p  pAny ideas Woodoop  pHere is some update to the issue emIt began to occur on Windows also magically not compiling significant portion of java files without any error indication and then I simply took a DIFF between the recently compiling version and the later non compiling version. Diff was easy because only a few changes. I found out that I had a java file of size approx 600k lots of inline data initialization etc. which seemed to make the difference. I split this particular java file into 2 pieces original into 109k and helper into 567k. Now it compiles again for Windows and I will probably continue looking for other such big files or splitting this one further to see if it will start to compile on Linux alsoemp

I see the remote command finish with ps xf, but cap doesnt seem to notice anymore. If the sleep is 20 instead of 240, the cap task works fine.p  pObviously this task is super useless, but we do have expensive things run on deploy that trigger this, and Ive made this to rule out any blame on ssh.p  pAnother data point, if we ssh into the box and put the code there and then run cap deploy from there, then it works fine.p  pSo... there seems to be some weird interplay going on between ssh and capistrano.

CurrentlySelectedItem on the ViewModel is populated, but the grid doesnt highlight the selected row.p  pIve tried with and without Updatesourcetrigger and IsSynchronisedWithCurrentItem but these cause it to select the first row in the grid and highlight that  and thus overwrite my previous value in CurrentlySelectedItem, which isnt what Im after.p  pAnyone got any ideas on how to achieve thisp

Negative 1158 pIve decided to use fluent mapping in Entity Framework. My intention was to map everyting by code without any atributes and auto mapping functions. Best way Ive found is class EntityTypeConfiguration, that I implement for each entity in my project. p  pLater I add property to one of my entity. This property isnt needed to be persisted. Ive expected, that until I add mapping for this property, it will be ignored by database and persistence layer. Unfortunatly it doesnt work that way, and property is mapped.

Negative 1158 pI am currently experimenting with SPAs and the structure of my first app roughly follows the pattern described in the upcoming book a hrefhttpwww.manning.commikowski relnofollowSingle Page Web Applicationsa by MikowskiPowell The app consists of modules which are nested into each other. One root module has one or more submodules, each of those might have one or more submodules of its own. To add the submodules to the DOM, the parent modules provides a jQueryelement to the child to which it attaches its own markup. Other than that the modules are more or less completely isolated and how they function doesnt matter to the rest of the SPA. Each modules resides in its own file and dependencies are resolved using require.js the book imports them manually. p  pNow Id like to use knockout.js to render some of the modules, but Im rather new to ko, so Im wondering Imagine a toplevel module has several submodules attached. It uses knockout.js to do its binding while one of the submodules does too but another one doesnt. each of course has its own model data.p  ol liIf I apply kobindings in the parent and the child restricted to the respective container element, will they interfere somehow when the markup of the child is actually enclosed by the markup of the parentli liHow would I implement require.js dependency resolution in a situation like thisli ol  pOne example that might illustrate the question rather well is that of a tabbed panel The parent has several tabs and uses knockout to determine which tab is currently visible. Each of the tabs is a module by itself that can have arbitrarily complex markupfunctionality itself and should therefore be encapsulated in its own filemodule.  p

Negative 1158 pI am creating a chat application that will also have the ability for file transfer. I am trying to design it with the MVVM pattern utilizing Prism.p  pMy model for this application, or at least this one modulethe application only has one module at this time, and it might be the only module, is a ChatManager class that is responsible for hosting servers, joining servers and holding all the state information of the chat sessions. It might be a client that is connecting to another server, or it might be both a client and a server as any individual who hosts a chat will also be a client to his own server.p  pIn my application I have different views and viewmodels for each of the different areas of the program, the message area, the area that has the user list, and the area where users type their messages. The views know nothing about the viewmodels, and the viewmodels know nothing about the views. The viewmodels are very simplistic and contain nearly no logic.p  pAll the logic resides in my ChatController class which basically controls the flow of the application. It is responsible for creating all of the views, all of the models, assigning the proper viewmodels as the datacontexts of the views, and injecting each of the views into the shell at the appropriate time. It also has the responsibility of assigning the actual data to the viewmodels, from the model.p  pThe problem Im having is how to cleanly keep the viewmodel ObservableCollections up to date with the Lists contained within the model. For example, in the model I have a list of connected users. Whenever that list changes, such as when a user connects or disconnects, I need to update the ObservableCollection of users in the viewmodel that handles the user list.p  pThe way Im thinking I need to accomplish this is using events. So Ive created events that are fired in the model whenever a user connects, whenever a user disconnects. Surely I must have events as well for when the server is sending out a message to all of the users and all the other things the model actually does.p  pI guess my question is, is this a good way of doing it Should I instead change the models user collection to be an ObservableCollection and avoid the events altogether, simply assigning the viewmodels collection to the model collectionp  pThe more I try to structure this application, the more confusing it becomes for me. Right now my controller is quite large in the number of methods it has and I havent even begun to add all the features of the chat program that I want to.p

Negative 1158 pI am working with one of our partner to integrate our business services. I am using WCF .Net 3.5 to communicate with partner web service. I think partner web service is written in Java. p  pUsing SVC util I generated proxy class. Instead DataContract serializer, svcutil used xmlserializer.

Partner said the xml namespaces sent by the request does not validate against their systems. They also replied with sample SOAP request. p  pBy comparing the both requests, the namespaces looks correct. But partner xml uses the prefixes to define the namespaces and elements are prefixed.

Negative 1158 pimg srchttpi44.tinypic.com14boqw7.png altimagep  pAbove is an example of the layout of how my program should look. The screen should have a simple header view up top and the remaining space below it is used to display other content. This other content is basically 3 pages of stuff. The parent scrollview should display one page at a time but can scroll left or right using paging to get to the other ones. The problem is that each of these pages is going to have different heights. Also, by using paging in the parent view, vertical scrolling also gets paged so I think I have to assign a scrollview for each individual page, each with paging disabled. This process is fairly annoying for autolayout because I have to manually calculate and overide intrinsicContentSize for every single view and make a custom method in viewcontrollers to return the height based on the intrinsic content sizes of its children and constraints used on them. I then need to use this height to constrain the widths and heights of the views so that the container scrollviews are able to calculate their contentsizes using autolayout. I can get stuff to show up using a mess of container uiviews and uiscrollviews but the only scrollview that receives events is the parent scroll view. Why are the child scroll views not respondingp

However, even though the Breeze web site says they are not tied to Microsoft, it appears that if you dont use EF, youre going to be in for a long and painful journey with Breeze.p  pWe tried evaluating the NoDB Breeze example, but that thing is very convoluted and difficult to understand as well as figure out how to implement it in a standard layered arch on the serverside  everything seems to be tightly coupled and is just put in the Models folder of a MVCWeb API project.p  pSo, my questions arep  p Is Breeze the wrong choice for a clientside data library if youre not using EFp  p If Breeze can be easily made to not use EF and using just straight ADO.NET on the serverside, is there a better example or documentation showing how to do thisp  p Given that our SPA implementation closely resembles John Papas SPA arch with durandal, knockout, Web API, etc., except again were not using EF, is there a better choice for us than Breezep  p And then theres SignalR...  We plan on implementing SignalR later, does Breeze even work with SignalRp  pThanksp

Negative 1158 pI am wondering if you can run Ant on a buildfile that would be located inside a JAR.  The reason why I am interested in this is because I would like to include a deploy target in my buildfile that could be called after the jar has been moved to its destination.  That deploy target would take care of extracting resources and other libraries required to run the program.p  pSo, for instance, I would package up properties, images and external jars inside of my jar when building.  The deployment process would then consist of moving the jar to the location it is meant to run in, and call codeant ltsomeOptiongt myjar.jarbuild.xml deploycode or something like that.p  pDoes that make sensep

Negative 1158 pIve been doing a lot of tutorials for different MVC frameworks, and it seems very typical for Authorization to take place in the Controller. Whyp  pMy thought is the Controller should only be used to orchestrate Model actions, to handle redirection and to handle error events. These are the things that are dependent on the specific request. Putting Authorization in the Controller seems like youre going to have to duplicate the authorization whenever youre using the same Model action in different Controller actions or different Controllers. If Auth is in the Model, you have consistent requirements for carrying out an action or state change on the data.p  pIve been googling and looking at other questions such as a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7261490shouldauthorizationbepartofthemodelorcontrollerShould authorization be part of the model or controllera but I dont really see why its the accepted convention.p  pstrongIs there a specific reason Im missing for putting Authorization in the controller over the modelstrongp  h2To sum up points in the commentsh2  ul liControllers are responsible for altering the state of the model layer and the current view. Nothing else.li liAuthorization belongs where an action is being carried out, if youre following a strict MVC pattern this would most likely be the model, and a Controller is certainly not responsible for authorizing the use of model actions.li liCookies should be treated like any other datastore abstracted and used within the models, not directly by controllers.li liAuthentication and Authorization are separate issues, though they both usually go in the model layer, because they usually involve checks against values in datastores such as cookies.li ul

Negative 1158 pIve only recently started to develop in ASP.NET, though Ive been using C for several years now. My first approach to ASP.NET was using MVC 4, but now I find myself working on a project that uses plain ASP.NET pages. Im at a loss as to how the general framework works. p  pSpecifically, I have no idea how to implement the Decorator Pattern in an ASP.NET page. I have a Product.aspx page and I have to add a feature to it. I thought that Decorator Pattern would be best based on the task requirements, and I immediately figured out how I would use it in MVC, since the actual logic that is executed lies in the Controller Action there I would instantiate my decorator object. p  pBut I have no idea how to do it in ASP.NET. As far as I can see, when the browser requests Product.aspx something creates an object of class Product derived from Page, and then its too late to decorate it. p  pIs it therefore possible to decorate a whole ASP.NET page not just an object used by the code behind How would I do thatp
Negative 1158 pI have written an application that I have listed in the Google Marketplace. I am trying to get my app to use the Directory API part of the Admin SDK. According to the documentation here a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comadminsdkdirectoryv1guidesprerequisites relnofollowhttpsdevelopers.google.comadminsdkdirectoryv1guidesprerequisitesa, this will require anyone who installs my app to enable API access.p  pThe only scope I need isp  precodehttpswww.googleapis.comauthadmin.directory.user.readonly codepre  pIs there any way to access the above scope without requiring API access to be enabled All I am ultimately trying to do is import users from a domain into my app so that they do not have to visit my app to have an account.p  pI am trying to avoid having to have the domain administrator enable API access. I have also seen other apps that require the same exact scope as I do that emseemem to work without requiring API access. Id be willing to drop back to the older, deprecated Google Data APIs, but I dont think I can even register an app to use them.p

Negative 1158 pI created a Scala application which reads information from a handful of sources and outputs it as an XML file, using codescala.xml.PrettyPrintercode. This file has to confirm to a XML Schema, because I also wrote an R script which will consume a file implementing the schema. p  pThe schema contains a few enumerations, and the validation fails with messages like p  prexmllint noout studiesclean.xml schema ..litsuchesatisfaction.xsd  studiesclean.xml 9 element satisfactionCorrelation Schemas validity error   Element httprumtschodissertationlitusersatsatisfactionCorrelation  [facet enumeration] The value          observed user reactions        is not an element of the set satisfaction, usability,  product quality, task process quality, absence of negative reactions,  task result quality, expectation disconfirmation, preference for a version,  enjoyment, observed user reactions, technology acceptance, likelihood of  referral, user state, attribute performance, user choice of action, time  spent doing a task, users impression of the system, impact of IS,  user characteristics, organisation context, task parameters, need fit,  cost, cognitive load. pre  pAs you can see, codeobserved user reactionscode is a member of my enumeration, but the same string with leading and trailing whitespace isnt getting recognized. This whitespace gets inserted by the pretty printer another line where the value is codeusabilitycode gets printed on a single row, and the validator doesnt complain there. p  pUsing the noblanks option of xmllint doesnt change anything. p  pI dont know what to change so that the whole thing works. I see two alternatives p  ol liI could stop using the pretty printer and instead use a formatter which removes all white space between elements from my Node before writing it to a file. This should validate, but if I ever have to open the file to check things manually, the absence of line breaks will be problematic. li liI could try to rewrite the XML schema to accept whitespace before and after the text of an enumeration element. li liI could try to somehow get xmllint to not pay attention to whitespace issues while validating. li ol  pOptions 2 and 3 also require me to make R trim any text while loading, but this is a oneline change. So I strongly prefer to use one of them. p  pstrongMy questionsstrong p  ol liIs option 3 possible at all Does xmllint have an option to ignore whitespace while validating If yes, how is it turned on If no, is an alternative tool which can validate my file quickly with a shell command li liIs option 2 possible at all Does XML Schema allow to mix a whitespace facet and an enumeration facet probably a newb question, but this is the first time I have ever written a schema li liAm I overlooking some drawback to Option 2 andor 3 which would make Option 1 a better solution li ol  pemupdate in response to a commentem This is the pretty printer output.

The class constructors set a default of 0 if called wo any arguments, an integer value if called with 1 argument, or a fraction if called with 2 arguments. If one or two arguments are passed there is no compile error. But if no arguments are passed I expected the constructor to be initialized to 0, instead I get a compiler error about the print statement being of nonclass type. It is as though the object wasnt created.  Any help or explanation of what I am doing wrong is greatly appreciated.  thank you kindly for your consideration.p  pClass descriptionp  precodefrac1.cpp include frac1.hpp include ltiostreamgt include ltcstdlibgt  default constructor FractionFraction   numer0, denom1  initialize fraction to 0      no further statements   FractionFractionint n  numern, denom1 whole integer initialization      no further statements   FractionFractionint n, int d  numern, denomd      if d0          stdcerr ltlt error denominator is 0 ltltstdendl         stdexitEXITFAILURE       void Fractionprint      stdcoutltltnumerltltltltdenomltltstdendl  codepre  pInterface Descriptionp  precodefrac1.hpp  ifndef FRAC1HPPINCLUDED define FRAC1HPPINCLUDED include ltistreamgt include ltcstdlibgt  namespace CPPDemo       Fraction Class     class Fraction      private         int numer, denom     public         Fraction         Fractionint         Fractionint,int          void print          endif  FRAC1HPPINCLUDED codepre  ptest file descriptionp  precodeftest.cpp include frac1.hpp include ltiostreamgt include ltcstdlibgt  int main      CPPDemoFraction y     y.print  flagged as compiler error  codepre  pMessage from Compilerp  pCUsersUserDesktopCPPDemoFractionClassTestftest.cpp9 error request for member print in y, which is of nonclass type CPPDemoFractionp

Negative 1158 pokay, so the object of the game is to run over the Parcel. this will show you what item the parcel contains, and where to take it. after you drop off the parcel to the location, the idea is to have a new randomly generated item and location for the next parcel. my problem is that the item and location will not seem to spawn to a new location, just roll random the first time, and keep spitting back that same item and location. can anyone help me outp  phere is my code p  precodeInitialize import pygame import random pygame.init  Display screen  pygame.display.setmode1180, 900

Negative 1158 pI am trying to replace a certain class file with my own in an obfuscated jar. The original class file has methods named new and null so a quick decompile  compile doesnt work. I tried compiling and using jbe to add new methods named new that relayed everything to newsymbol functions with newsymbol beeing the decompiled version of the original new function. This did not work. code segment has wrong length in class filep  pDoes anyone know of a way to refractor method names in class files And if that isnt possible, a way to reliably create those proxy functions From google I learned that there are about 1000 different backend librarys but only jbe as fronted for bytecode editingp  pstrongEDITstrong Let me try to illustrate it. Lets say that there is a jar file with a class that provides a function that logs everything you give it to a database. Id like to replace that class file with my own, and it should not only log everything to a database, but also print whatever data it gets to the command line.p  pThe problem is, that class file was obfuscated and the obfuscator gave it public method names like new  or null. If you tryp  precodepublic class replacement public void new string data ...   codepre  pAnd compile that, you get compilation errors.p  pMy idea was to create this p  precodepublic class replacement public void newsymbol string data ...   codepre  pAnd use a bytecode editor to create a function named new that calls newsymbol with the same arguments. but I get code segment wrong length and other errors going down this route.p  pMy question therefore could be better frased as give me a way to intercept calls to a class file whos public methods are named new null weirdunicodesymbols....p

Negative 1158 pMy application has a dependency on a large 3rd party library, over 500 Meg. I get the source for this library as a zip file which is released several times a year. I need to be able to make changes to this codebase, Id like those changes to be maintained in a Mercurial repository, but I really dont want to have to push a 500 Meg codebase to a remote repository. Firstly it will take ages to upload, it will eat most of my space allowance on the remote server, and it will take ages to pull a fresh copy.p  pSo what Im wondering is this is there any way to store in a remote repository just the changes made to a codebase but without pushing the whole codebase itself So that creating a new build would consist of installing the original codebase from the zip redistributable downloaded from a file server, initializing the original codebase as a Mercurial repository, and then pulling from the remote repository just the changes made to that codebase.p  pOr is there a completely different way to achieve the same thingp
Negative 1158 pI have an AI routine that stores various kinds of data as codeMemorycode objects. codeMemorycode objects have different parameters based on their memory type which is passed to the constructor in retrospect, each type of memory really should have been a subclass of codeMemorycode, but thats not important at the moment.p  pI need to set up a codestrcode method for codeMemorycodes. In another language, I might do something like thisp  precodeif self.memtype  Price     return self.good is worth self.price at self.location elif self.memtype  Wormhole     return self.fromsys has a wormhole to self.tosys ... codepre  pBut the Pythonic and fast way to do this sort of thing is to use dicts.

Negative 1158 pI am experiencing a problem with mirrored datasets. This situation occured because the data model was switched a few months past and I just got recently assigned to this project, which already had a new application and data model done.p  pI was tasked with importing all the data from the old MS Access application to the new one and heres where the error has its source. The old data model was written in a way that every dataset was also stored as its mirrored counterpart. Imagine a database table like thisp  ppk  A  Bp  p1  hello  worldp  p2  world  hellop  pI imported the data via a self made staging process via Excel and VBA coding and that worked fine. The staging was necessary because I wanted to create insert statements and therefore had to map all the old IDs, names, ... to the news ones.p  pWhile testing the application after the import was done, I realized that the GUI showed all datasets twice. The reason for it being shown twice and not once and then once again in mirrored form, is the way we fill the ListBox that shows the resultsp  pI found the reason for that error in the mirrored data and now would like to get rid of it. The first idea I had is rather long and probably overcomplicated, thats why I am posting here, in hope of finding a shorter solution.p  pSo, my idea is as follows and would use solely VBA codingp  ol liFilling recordSet with a SELECT  FROM mirroredDataTableli liWrite a SQLStatement and check if the recordCount of that statements result is 1 for each record in the recordSet from 1.li liIf the resultCount is 1 then one of the IDs in that result is written into a new recordSet or Arrayli liThe recordSet  array from 4. is parsed again and for each ID in there I create a DELETE statementli lili liprofitli ol  pNow I already have an idea for the SQL statement in 2., but before I begin Id just like to ensure that there is no easy way that I havent considered yet or just have overlooked.p  pWould greatly appreciate any helpinfotips you can provide.p  pPS It is NOT an option to redesign the whole data model or something among the lines of this not my decisionp

Negative 1158 pIm developing a client and server system with the following characteristics Client and sever here are running on Linux.p  pThere is a pair of redundant server hosts used for hw survivability. Each host has a fixed IP address. There is also a floating IP address that is bounded to one host at a time.p  pDuring a transition the standby host unbinds the floating IP, then the newly active host binds to it. The binding is done with the ifconfig updown command. An arping U is used to let know to the switch that the MAC associated with the address has changed.p  pBoth server hosts are connected to the same switch.p  pIn this system hosts names fqdn are not used.p  pThe server hosts are running 2 java processes and an erlang one.p  pThe client has a permanent listening socket open on the erlang process, and also communicate with the Java processes using an RMI interface and a REST interface. The Jersey v 1.17 framework is used for REST. All Java processes are running Java 1.6.p  pWhen a client connects to the active server using the floating address things are originally working fine. At one point I force a switch of the servers.  The former active host unbinds the floating address, and the former standby host binds to it.p  pFun starts here. Three different behaviors are seen depending on where the client is running.p  ul liA the client is running on a different network than the host routing is needed to reach the server.li liB the client is running on    the originally standby host remember that both server hosts are on   the same networkswitch.li liC the client is running on the initially    active host.li ul  pB amp C are use cases that are required.p  pCase A was the easiest to solve. As soon as the address is unbounded I get a socket exception, that I can react to, from the connection to the erlang process. Simply waiting a bit for the address to be bounded again and reconnecting fixes this. The RMI interface is the same, doing a name lookup again returns stubs that point to the new active host  the stub points to the fixed address  I can live with that Then when I issue REST request they also get routed to the new active host.p  pCase B provides a slightly different error, and heartbeat plays a role in the detection of the change, but the solution is the same.p  pThe case that defies my understanding is case C. In this case connection to the erlang process is properly moving from the local host, to the new active host. The RMI name lookup is also done from the new host.p  pThe REST calls however are returning data from the local host former active host, instead of the new active host. This conditions remains for a few minute  often 34 minutes then things fix themselves I worked very hard to try to figure this one out, testing, web digging, so far no luck.p  pI considered that this behavior could come from 3 placesp  ul liOS i.e. kernel tcpip handling  li liThe Java VM or its standard librariesli liThe Jersey librariesli ul  pI made many hypothesisp  ul lipThe Linux kernelIP stack, is caching the connection and does not realize that the address has moved until the cache times out.   I tried various command to flush it no go.   The fact that the connection to erlang and that the name lookup works, is leaning me to believe that the kernel does not create the issue here.pli lipI considered that there could be some privileged java to java things happening in the guts of Java or the VM.   The fact that the name lookup works, probably invalidates this as well.pli lipMy last hypothesis is that Jersey is doing some kind of caching.br The web is talking about Http connection pooling.   Actually that could be the pooling of HttpUrlConnection done by Java.  I tried to learn more about this but only found vague references.   However most information I got indicates that the socket should be opened and closed for each REST request.pli ul  pBy now Im desperate and ready to consider any hypothesis  p  pCan anyone shed light on a mechanism that would continue to routes packets to the wrong hosts after the address moved host.p  pWhat can we say about the fact that it appears to clear after 3 to 4 minutes. What type of cache could this be.p  pThank you all for any tips.p

Negative 1158 pIm using Ribbon from RibbonControlsLibrary.dll 4.0.0.11019, .NET 4.0, C, WPF. It can be downloaded with a free samples here a hrefhttpwww.microsoft.comenusdownloaddetails.aspxid11877 relnofollowhttpwww.microsoft.comenusdownloaddetails.aspxid11877ap  pI have a problem of space usage in my codeRibboncode.p  pIn a codeRibbonGroupcode of my codeRibboncode I have pretty much buttons that are separated by codeRibbonSeparatorcode see the picture below. I know its better to use multiple codeRibbonGroupcodes instead, but for specific reason I cant do that. When I resize my codeRibboncode, the default codeRibboncode layout makes buttons smaller. At some moment group collapses to a single button. The problem is that the moment of collapse comes too early. I would like some of my buttons to become still smaller. That is critical, because some of my clients might have small monitors.  p  pJust to show how it happens, I changed all the images of my buttons to a sample image, and all the letters in buttons to t img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com6EvXJ.png altenter image description herep  pThe picture shows the moment of collapse for my codeRibbonGroupcode. If I shorten my window even a little bit more, codeRibbonGroupcode collapses. Its easy to see that many of buttons still could hide their text, or some of the icons could become smaller.p  pI tried to use codeRibbonGroup.GroupSizeDefinitionscode property to set all the possible variants for buttons sizesp  precode    int groupItemsCount  group.Items.Count     group.GroupSizeDefinitions.Clear       Fully expanded definition     var expandedDefinition  new RibbonGroupSizeDefinition     for int i  0 i lt groupItemsCount i              expandedDefinition.ControlSizeDefinitions.Addnew RibbonControlSizeDefinition              ImageSize  RibbonImageSize.Large,             IsLabelVisible  true                   group.GroupSizeDefinitions.AddexpandedDefinition       Buttons of Ribbon gradually lose label and have small image     for int i  groupItemsCount  1 i gt 0 i              var def  new RibbonGroupSizeDefinition         for int j  0 j lt groupItemsCount j                      if j gt i                              def.ControlSizeDefinitions.Addnew RibbonControlSizeDefinition                                      ImageSize  RibbonImageSize.Small,                     IsLabelVisible  false                                           else                              def.ControlSizeDefinitions.Addnew RibbonControlSizeDefinition                                      ImageSize  RibbonImageSize.Large,                     IsLabelVisible  true                                                group.GroupSizeDefinitions.Adddef            Collapsed definition     group.GroupSizeDefinitions.Addnew RibbonGroupSizeDefinition  IsCollapsed  true  codepre  pThen with resizing window, buttons become smaller from right to left.  Here is how the same codeRibboncode of the same size looks then img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comBLiZy.png altenter image description herep  pBut window resizing naturally slows down, and sometimes codeRibboncode resizing crashes at some moment buttons stop changing their size after codeRibboncode resizing.p  pSo finally, how could I make my codeRibboncode use the available space optimally Of course, the preferred variant is the default codeRibboncode layout behavior, but how can I tell codeRibboncode that its allowed to hide text labels and make smaller images for all the buttonsp

Negative 1158 pI have interesting question regarding an application making use of AngularJS and D3. Essentially, I have an ngrepeat which repeats based on the contents of an array. In this array are objects which contain a REST url they will periodically reach out to and pull data from. Once they get this data, a graph is drawn using D3 one graph for each object in the array.p  pThe issue I am having is dynamically adding an object to this array via user input, and having the drawing work correctly. It appears that the d3 code jumps the gun and starts trying to select SVG elements that havent been rendered yet as Angular is still finishing adding stuff to the DOM via ngrepeat.p  pI have tried using timeout, and also created a custom directive similar to this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13471129angularjsngrepeatfinisheventAngularJS ngrepeat finish eventa.p  pIt works well, but only seems to fire the event the first time that the ngrepeat is run, not when I add another object to the array. Any comments on the best way to handle this situation If I could fire the event based on last everytime a new object is addedremoved and then iterate through the array and invoke the drawing function, that seems like it would work.p  pCheersp  pEdit The D3 code currently is similar to this a hrefhttpbl.ocks.orgmbostock1346410 relnofollowhttpbl.ocks.orgmbostock1346410a which is just a simple donut chart update, with the caveat that the redraw is triggered by a REST call. In the future however there may be more complicated graphs and such which is why I was hoping to use D3.p  pEdit 2 I have moved all my D3 code into a custom directive and after a lot of messing around it seems to work almost as it should. By not isolating the scope, the custom element has the same scope as the ngrepeat and can access the object and its properties, as well as the relevant DOM elements currently I am creating a DIV with an ID that is unique to each object.p  pThe problem now comes when using d3.select...when I try and select the DIV where I want to place the drawing, it will not allow me to select by ID, as it returns null..what is very strange about this is if I selectAlldiv, it can find the div Im looking for, but wont let me select just that one.p  pHere is a JsFiddle showing what I mean...check the console and see the first test returns the div obj1, but the second select returns null.p  pIf I could get this working and then append my SVG canvas and drawing within that div, I think it would workp  pRelevant selectsp  precode    var test  d3.selectAlldiv        console.logtest        var chart  d3.selectobj obj.id        console.logchart codepre  pHTML that should create the divsp  precode    ltdiv ngrepeatobject in myDatagt         ltdiv idobjobject.idgt             Hi             ltbarschartgtltbarschartgt        ltdivgt    ltdivgt  codepre  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netSleepyProgrammereN6p73 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netSleepyProgrammereN6p73ap

In that case I assume that mongoose just query the mongodb without any compression.p  pNot sure how to test this, I just made some amateur benchmark and assumptions.p  pCombined Upload speed of MongoDB Server and Download speed of API Server is 1.3MBs. p  pThe data I am requesting is about 5MB size.p  pIncluding data processing in API server side the total processing time of this data is 4 Seconds.p  pThats a lot of timep  pAny help on how to further benchmark or do compression in mongoose would be really helpful.p  pMany thanks,p  pKarthikp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com68g6v.jpg altMy Application stackp

Negative 1158 pI am an rather inexperienced juniordeveloper, working for a startup in germany. I am currently refactoring a highly scattered code base, trying to optimize the design a bit ...p  pstrongProblemstrongp  pWhen implementing the data access layer, we can choose to follow the principles of the DAO pattern. This works well as long as the entities we deal with are rather specific eg. User, Invoice, Account, etc..  But when we have a more generic database model we may frequently feel the need to query for specific result sets that are compositions of several tables. Often it is not obvious which data access object we should assign query methods to.p  pstrongExamplestrong p  pTake the OSM openstreetmap.org database Effectively there are just Nodes, Ways and Relations that make up representations of many different objects such as streets, buildings, traffic signs etc.. When querying for an amenity it may be represented by a single Node a single point, e.g. a memorial, a Way a path, lets say the outlines of museum or collection of Ways e.g. the buildings of a university campus. p  pBesides that I may only be interested in a fraction of the information available, and it might be overhead to fetch full entities. Or I may use database specific functions in my queries, which lead to results that abstract even further from the underlying entity model.p  pI give you an example in code in java, using the springframeworks repository interfacep  precodepublic class IWayRepository extends RepositoryltWay, Longgt      ...     Queryvalue  select distinct ways.tagsgtaddrinterpolation as type,        trimboth  from textways.nodes as nodes from nodes, waynodes, ways         where nodes.tagsgtaddrstreet and waynodes.nodeidnodes.id         and ways.idwaynodes.wayid         and stintersectsstgeometryfromtext,4326,nodes.geom        and existways.tags,addrinterpolationtrue, nativeQuery  true     ListltMapltString, Objectgtgt findAdressInterpolationInfoForStreetInBboxString street,       String bbox     ...  codepre  pThe code queries over several tables, alters data with a function on the databaselayer and returns an extract of data that hardly fits into the domain of the given entity. p  pstrongIdeastrongp  pTo improve the design there are coming two options coming to my mind for now. p  ul liMake up a more specific data access class The AddressRepository, where I access bare result sets. But I dont really like that idea. li liMake up a more generic Service class A LocalizationService for example.li ul  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pAre there any established practises to deal with such situations How do I design the data access to generic databasemodels.

Negative 1158 pI am very new to this site and a novice programmer so Im hoping someone here can help me with the problem Im facing. I am making a simple program that uses a card layout to selectenter several userspecific options that will be stored in string variables and then after the last question, used to give a unique answer. Right now the program advances slides successfully and displays the proper question, however it does not clear the JRadioButton from the first card and keeps using this radio button instead of the desired component for the duration of the program. For example, The second and third card should have JTextFields while the 4th card should have a JComboBox. I have two main class files, one that is the actual frame and the other that is displayed below which does the work behind the scenes. For future reference, I plan to modify this into an applet once it is working properly so any advice on that would be great. Any help will be greatly appreciated, thanks.p  pI believe the problem may stem from the creation of multiple card objects here, the ScreenPanel objects each take the same parameters but depending on the different card, a different Component needs to be produced. p  precode         set up questions         String question1  Sex          String[] responses1  Female, Male         ask[0]  new ScreenPanelquestion1, responses1         String question2  Height in inches          String[] responses2  new String[1]         ask[1]  new ScreenPanelquestion2, responses2         String question3  Weight in pounds          String[] responses3  new String[1]         ask[2]  new ScreenPanelquestion3, responses3         String question4  Event          String[] responses4  Shot Put, Discus Throw, Long Jump, Triple Jump, High Jump, Pole Vault, 4 x 800 Relay, 100 Meter Hurdles, 100 Meter Dash, 4 x 200 Relay,                 1600 Meter Run, 4 x 100 Relay, 400 Meter Dash, 300 Meter Hurdles, 800 Meter Run, 200 Meter Dash, 3200 Meter Run, 4 x 400 Relay         ask[3]  new ScreenPanelquestion4, responses4         String question5  Distanceinches or Timeseconds         ask[4]  new ScreenPanelquestion5, new String[1]         ask[4].setFinalQuestiontrue         addListeners      codepre  pThe Screen Panel class here creates each card, could be a problem with the conditionals but not sure. p  precodeclass ScreenPanel extends JPanel     JLabel question     JRadioButton[] response1     JTextField response2     JTextField response3     JComboBox response4     JTextField response5     JButton nextButton  new JButtonNext     JButton finalButton  new JButtonFinish     String textResponse1, textResponse2, textResponse3, textResponse4, textResponse5      ScreenPanelString ques, String[] resp         super         setSize320, 260         question  new JLabelques         JPanel sub1  new JPanel         JPanel sub2  new JPanel         sub1.addquestion         if TrackAndField.currentScreen  0             response1  new JRadioButton[resp.length]             ButtonGroup group  new ButtonGroup             for int i  0 i lt resp.length i                 response1[i]  new JRadioButtonresp[i], false                 group.addresponse1[i]                 sub2.addresponse1[i]                          textResponse1  group.getSelection.toString                  if TrackAndField.currentScreen  1             sub2.removeresponse1[0]             sub2.removeresponse1[1]             response2  new JTextField4             KeyAdapter monitor  new KeyAdapter                  public void keyTypedKeyEvent event                     textResponse2  response2.getText                                           sub2.addresponse2                   if TrackAndField.currentScreen  2             sub2.removeresponse2             response3  new JTextField10             KeyAdapter monitor  new KeyAdapter                  public void keyTypedKeyEvent event                     textResponse3  response3.getText                                           sub2.addresponse3                   if TrackAndField.currentScreen  3             sub2.removeresponse3             response4  new JComboBoxresp             sub2.addresponse4             textResponse4  response4.getSelectedItem.toString          codepre

Negative 1158 pThe screen Im trying to create is very simple. I have two UIViews stacked atop one another. The top UIView, topView, has height of 40px, and the UIView below, botView, takes up the rest of the screen. However, sometimes topView should not appear and I want botView to take up the entirety of the screen. p  pWhat Ive tried is setting width, leadingtrailing space on both views. Then topView gets distance to top layout guide, botView gets distance to bottom layout guide, and then an additional constraint for vertical spacing between topView and botView. But this results in xcode yelling at me that I havent set a height or y constraint on one of the views. Of course, I cant set a height constraint because I do not want either of them to be fixed height.p  pIm sure there must be an elegant constraint solution here that I just cant seem to figure out.

However, due to lack of a proper unique constraint, a bunch of bad UPDATE statements resulted in duplicated info.

My goal is to retrace the log entries and revert one of the duplicates to its last known good value before it became a dupe.p  pIdeally, I want to revert the CurrentCustomerValue for one of the dupes to a previous value. In the above example it would be the LogId3 for CustomerRecordId1, and LogId15 for CustomerRecordId3.p  pI am completely stumped.p

I think what I need to do is get the apm command line tools to work to be able to run on my terminal so I can run atom install minimap.p  pThanks in advancep
Negative 1158 pIve switched building anything with an UI to C. Up to now Ive been native C only.

You need to wrap the codeCREATE TABLEcode in a crazy codeIFcode to replicate the functionality. Same for codeCONSTRAINTScode.li licodeUNIQUEcode columns take codeNULLcode into consideration so you can have only one codeNULLcode.

Negative 1158 pIm currently working on a dll which would be used across future projects, and trying to fill it with every useful method developped in the last one. One of these methods that id like to reuse allows to generate an excel file with any object collection, and uses a resx resource file to get the column headers based on the objects property names.p  pNow, my problem is that I cant access or even check the existence of such a file from the library. A possible workaround would be to turn this resource file into a dictionary and pass it as a parameter, but I didnt find a way to do so or any documentation on the subject. Any hint or suggestion about this p  pThank you for helping me here...p  pP.S.  Im working with Visual Studio 2013, in case that could be relevant.p

Negative 1158 pI am trying to create a new function in my model which an agent performs on each of its neighbours successively, aggregating the sum as it goes along.

Negative 1158 pFirstly I hope this question does not violate the rules, sorry in advance if it does.p  pI just just had a discussion with a colleague regarding the way we have been designing and implementing our user controls. We have been creating views which expect a certain data type, yet dont enforce that expectation and I feel this is the wrong approach. Controls are instantiated by assigning a value to the DataContext, but since that is of type Object, not only is there no data type enforcement, but it is also beginning to become very hard to see what data type is being passed to the control because often a control is nested several layers under other user controls implemented in the same fashion.p  pMy proposal was to instead have a dependency property which we will use instead of the DataContext. Internally, the user control, could set its DataContext to this dependency property. This seems like not only the best approach, but also the unwritten standard in WPF.p  pMy colleague is concerned this could cause difficulties down the road since it less flexible than using an DataContext type Object.p  pI plan to bring this up again at our next software meeting, are there any bookswebsites you could recommend to help argue for one case or the otherp  pTLDR Which is more correctp  precode    ltDataTemplate DataTypexType vmMyCustomViewModelgt         ltvwMyCustomView gt     ltDataTemplategt codepre  pOrp  precode    ltDataTemplate DataTypexType vmMyCustomViewModelgt         ltvwMyCustomView ValueBinding gt     ltDataTemplategt codepre
Negative 1158 pIve been writing out a Javascript version of the 15 slider puzzle and am able to simulate the moving of the tiles through swapping innerHTML values. Im also using  instead of an array, as Ive seen others suggest.

I just dont know how to make it check to see if the puzzle actually IS solved.   p  pI was thinking of having an alert popup with a conditional if statement i.e., if the blank cell is located at row 3, cell 3 but that quickly fizzled out.

Ive checked target frameworks for both projects and they match 4.5 and I have EF 5.0 added.p  pAfter building the basic product presentationcatalog and cart code I want to implement users so I can build the orderstore functions.p  pEverything is working fine until this point.p  pI run EnableMigrations so I can write my own membershipuser code and use the DB I have setup so future context changes target my DB instead of the defaultOCnnection.p  pEnable Migrations inserted the Migrations folder and Configuration class. Ran with no errors produced. Checking if the context targets and exisiting database ... Code First Migrations enabled for project .WebUI.p  pWhen I attempted a Build after running EnableMigrations, I received a number of errors stating that The type or namespace Mvc does not exist in the namespace System.Web in the Domain project my product class and one error Could not resolve reference. Could not locate assembly System.Web.Mvc, Version 4.0.0.0 .... Check to make sure the assembly exists on the disk ... And of course an error from WebUI that it could not locate the Domain.dll because Domain.dll fails to build.p  pHow did running enableMigrations cause thisp  pHow do I resolve this The dll is on the disk, right where the properties say it is, Reference included, Local Copytrue .... p  pIm really at a loss to figure this one out .... p

Negative 1158 pHee guys, p  pIm currently debugging an Application which retreives certain data from a database, it wil display it afterwards in a listview. However it uses an extra method to sort these results on date and display this in a Category called Gesorteerd op datum and this contains subcategorys with the months in it. Examplep  pa hrefhttpi888.photobucket.comalbumsac86jordisipkensScreenshot20141029102524zps6470cd9d.png relnofollowLink screenshot because i miss 1 reputation to upload a image.ap  pAs you can see the opened part is static, im using a function to select all the data between a certain time period and then sort these over months and insert these back into the database to make things as dynamic as possibleIm also inserting the custom made Gesorteerd op Datum and the months. However when first using this App and you open this fragment the Gesorteerd on Datum part is completely missing. However by pressing back and then go in again its there.p  pSo the problem is that the inserts takes longer to complete then the function to select and display all the list items. I tried fixing this by using 2 Asynctasks. p  pFirst asynctask  DoInBackground function inserts the Gesorteerd op datum and al submonths, this uses a listener so that it wont do the next thing until it completes. Then the onPostExecute runs a function that displays the categorys. However here it already goes wrong because the gesorteerd op datum isnt added in the Array that later is used to display the listview.p  pSecond Asynctask  DoInBackground uses a functions that gets and sorts the events by date and inserts them afterwards. Then the onPostexecute gets all the events including the gesorteerd op datum events and displays them in the listview below. as said above it doesnt do what it should do.p  pAnyone knows where it goes wrong Because after reading the Asynctask documentation, I understand it shouldnt load the categorys after the first insert is done. But it still does load them to early.p  precode   Insert Static categories into database.

Negative 1158 pI am developing an Android app for blind users.  I expect blind users to use TalkBack.  My specific question is about the TalkBack message that comes up keyboard hidden when the user finishes entering text on the keyboard.  I would like to suppress this message or detect the end of the spoken message.p  pBackgroundcontext a common problem with TalkBack is that its speech messages clobber any other speech synthesis or speech recognition that you want to do in your app.  I have worked around this problem in most cases by contriving to suppress TalkBack messages, for example, by setting Activity titles to a null string.p  pCurrently I am adding functionality that uses the keyboard with the option of speech recognition, incidentally.  I was able to suppress the TalkBack message that ordinarily comes up to announce the appearance of the keyboard.p  pHowever, I cannot suppress the TalkBack message keyboard hidden that comes up when the user finishes entering text in my app, by pressing the Done key on the keyboard.  This particular message is specific to the standard Google keyboard, which, of course, I would like to support.  There is no corresponding message with the TouchPal keyboard, but that keyboard has other problems regarding TalkBack.p  pI would be happy if I could do either of the followingp  ol lipSuppress the TalkBack message when the Google keyboard is hidden, orpli lipDetect when the TalkBack message has finished.pli ol  pBy way of context, 2 is what I do with speech synthesis within my app.  I use TextToSpeech.setOnUtteranceProgressListener to detect the end of synthesized speech, and only after the end of the speech do I start speech recognition or another synthesized speech message.  This works very well.  Speech generated by my app does not clobber other speech, nor get picked up by speech recognition.  TalkBack, on the other hand, appears to be oblivious to anything else going on, and I would welcome any ideas on how to cope with that.p  pThank you very much.p

So I could put this array of quantities into plt.hist and get an informative chart, but the xaxis would not be in the units of frequencies.  My guess is that the xaxis would just be the indices of the array, but even that doesnt seem to be correct when I plot it. Thanks,p

Negative 1158 pI have an Outlook addin where I need to display a ribbon in the main Outlook window and in the Mail Read window as well. To do this I have added two ribbon xml files with the right markups in them. I then added a C class that implements the Office.IRibbonExtensibility interface where I have implemented the GetCustomUI method which returns the right XML. Finally I did this in the ThisAddIn.cs classp  precodeprotected override Office.IRibbonExtensibility CreateRibbonExtensibilityObject                      try                                ribbon  new Ribbon                 return ribbon                          catch Exception e                                        return null          codepre  pSo far so good. The ribbons load and everything shows in correct place.p  pNow the problem is that this Ribbon.cs file is getting rather huge as all the callbacks live in this file. Is there a way to split the callbacks into multiple classes So if I have a Ribbon1.xml and RIbbon2.xml can I have equivalent Ribbon1.cs and Ribbon2.csp

Negative 1158 pI have a JBoss EAP 6.3 server on localhost with a SOAP service on it which I am testing with Jmeter 2.11 and HTTP Request samplers.p  pNow I want to analyze the impact on performance using HTTPS with TLSv1 when consuming the SOAP service. For testing this I am looping 1 thread with 8 HTTP Requests, of which 4 use HTTP on port 8080 and the same 4 again with HTTPstrongSstrong on port 8443.p  pMy first idea was to use Wireshark to see if the HTTPS requests are encrypted and spy on the SSL handshake to see the used cipher suite, but I cant listen on the loopback interface I simply dont have one it seems.p  pstrongSo my question isstrong Can I somehow detect which cipher suite JMeter uses for https requests, for example from JMeter log files or using a Beanshell PostProcessor and read this information from some of the provided variables ctx, prev, log, etc.p

Negative 1158 pI have a bit of experience with Cocos2d but its also been quite a while since Ive worked with it. That being said, I dont necessarily need code handed to me  just a pointer towards the right approach I should be taking to achieve my requirements. p  pMy project is a simple block game, where players move blocks by swiping them the blocks move at the exact speed of the swipe, no acceleration. What I want to achieve, is when the player swipes a block off screen, I want the part of the sprite which is hidden offscreen to appear at another edge of the screen and keep moving until the drag motion has stopped a bit like the old mobile game, Snake II. When the sprite has completely moved off the screen, it should now be completely visible somewhere on the opposing side of the screen. so the screen is like an infinite loop which the sprite can move on. For example, the sprite is 40 visible on the left of the screen, and 60 visible on the right of the screen halved at screen boundary, 0.x. As the sprite moves left, it will become 35 visible on the left, and 65 on the right.p  pWhat is the best approach to tackle this Should I be duplicating the sprite and then moving the new copy onto the screen in an opposing fashion Or is this somehow possible with one sprite and some kind of maskp  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.

Negative 1158 pI am currently working on an API for a server software so users can extend my software by programming plugins for it instead of modifying the software themselves, and allow other users without programming knowledge to easily change the software by adding these plugins. So far, everything is working fine. But, I am running into a problem with configuration.p  pYou see, each plugin has a plugin.yml file stored with these 4 attributes Main The main class is stored here Name This is where the plugin name is stored Version This is where the plugin version is stored Author This is where the plugin author is storedp  pNow, in order for the plugin to print something to the console, they use a function called this.getServer.getLogger.infoMESSAGE They extend another class for plugins, thats why they use this instead of another class to logp  pBut, I do not have any idea on how to get which plugin is which when they are calling the function. I have a ArrayList of PluginSessions which event handlers use to cycle through to run Event Functions.p  pMy solution is to get the jar from which a class is being called so I can then get the plugin.yml from there. But, I have NO idea on how to get that, I have tried using Class.forName and some other code. But because the class is nonexistent within the jarproject running the code, It will throw a ClassNotFoundException.p  pDoes anyone here know how to get the jar from which a class is coming from without using Class.forName Thanks Trentp

Negative 1158 pI am creating a program that draws a polygon and fills it. It then displays buttons so the user can move the polygon up, down, left, or right. Right now I am having an issue when I call the repaint method. p  pIn the paint method I create a new instance of the class that contains the methods to draw and fill the polygon.

Negative 1158 pIs there a way to failfast as soon as multiple threads enter a method which is known emnotem to be threadsafep  pEdit Assuming a method is synchronized externally and not supposed to run concurrently. However, if external synchronization fails for some reason, it would be great to fail as soon as possible, thus avoiding subtle racecondition issues. Also, since the method normally runs in a single thread only, would be great to avoidminimize synchronization penalty of the check.p
Negative 1158 pI wanted to use an external folder because in my last project that i lost i used an external folder and every time i changed something to my tiled map and ran my program the changes would be there. However, now that Im using an assets folder within my project, it works but I have to delete the whole folder go to its actual location and recopy the folder back in in order for changes to be seen. I have tried refreshing both the folder and the project numerous times but it seems to force me to have to delete it and recopy the folder back in. If someone could tell me how to either use an external folder or get my folder to refresh like how I said it used to I would be very gratefulp

Negative 1158 pI have a WPFMVVMLight application. My main viewviewmodel has a data grid with code behind in the viewmodel. I recently decided Id like this datagrid in a 2nd view, one view is live data, one view is showing history of same data. I dont want to duplicate this code in two places so I decided to create a usercontrol with a viewmodel and move the appropriate datagridcode to the usercontrol. p  pHere is the issuequestion I would like to set the usercontroldatagriditemsource to a property in my main viewmodel. Ive seen some examples where people create dependencyproperties but Im not sure how to handle this because I cant inherit DependencyObject in my viewmodel because it already inherits ViewModelBase from mvvm light, so I cant use GetValueSetValue as seen below. Im very new to this so I may be missing something very obvious. While looking for solutions to my problem Im seeing that MVVM Light has some messaging functionality, would this be a better way to approach this Is there a better approach to this than what im taking Thanks for any guidance.p  pExample not pulled from my code, just used to show the GetValueSetValue that I cant figure out how to use because I cant inherit DependencyObject.p  precodepublic class MyViewModel  ViewModelBase       public static DependencyProperty MyProperty          DependencyProperty.RegisterGridItemSource, typeofEventData, typeofMyViewModel,         new FrameworkPropertyMetadata  BindsTwoWayByDefault  true       public EventData GridItemSource              get  return EventDataGetValueMyProperty          set  SetValueMyProperty, value       codepre  p Attemping to be more clear in what im hoping to achieve..p  pBelow is an example of the datagrid in my usercontrol. My user control has a VM with code behind with properties for the bindings you see below and some additional code related to the context menu. p  pThe issue im trying to resolve is how to set the usercontrol datagrid itemsource now that it is in a usercontrol that is nested in my main view, and eventually will be nested in one more view. My mainview has a ObservableCollection with the data I want the usercontroldatagriditemsource set to.

Negative 1158 pI have an oracle table which has these two columns, CreateDate and FlagId, among others. The FlagID is an integer column. I have to first extract all the rows with FlagID in 3000, 3001, 3002. I will do the select statement where FlagID in 3000, 3001, 3002 order by CreateDate, FlagID desc. Now I will have many sets of these three rows. I have to select the latest set of value. However, it may not always be set of three. It can be 3001, 3002, 3000, 3001, 3002 and so on. In this case I have to select the first two rows omitting subsequent sets. If the top rows have all three flags then I have to retrieve three rows. I have created an oracle cursor and got all rows selected by these values order by CreateDate . But I am not sure how to pick top set of rows by creating a subset from the cursor.p
Negative 1158 pIn our webshop, all items and user information for a specific order are related in our databaseand users browser to a unique cookie that represents that order.p  pWe have a page in our webshop where the user is supposed to input all their contact information. However, we have decided that the input of the user should never be lost, regardless if they filled all the fields. Therefore, we save all of the fields every time a user leaves the contact info page.p  pUnfortunately, we have discovered that this could create some problems if the user has the contact info page open in 2 separate tabs. They could input their information in one of the tabs, then proceed to checkout, then right before they pay they could close the second tab that contains empty fields and the empty fields address, city etc. would be saved for their order, which causes the first tab payment page to fail we cant send a package to an empty address.p  pWe have been trying to find a solution to this problem. The most obvious solution would be to validate if the minimum address information is inputaddress, zip, city before overwriting the existing values in the database. However, lets say the user inputs their info as followsp  ol liName John Doeli liAddress Example str1li liCity Londonli liPostcode  xyzli liCountry UKli liPhone 1111111li ol  pThen, in another tab they input only address fields and leave the rest emptyp  ol liName  li liAddress  Test str2li liCity Parisli liPostcode abcli liCountry li liPhone li ol  pIn that situation we would overwrite only a part of the user information and the database will containp  ol liName John Doeli liAddress Test str2li liCity Parisli liPostcode  abcli liCountry UKli liPhone 1111111li ol  pWhich is firstly a wrong address and secondly, the user wouldnt have any idea why their data is saved in such a wrong way in our system.  Another solution would be to save only when all of the fields are filled, but that leaves many cases where the user inputs all fields but one, closes page and when they come back they would have to input their information all over again.p  pOur webshop runs on an IIS 7 server.p  pIs there any way to limit the server to deliver this page to the users browser only once Or to limit the page serverside so it cannot be open in two tabs simultaneously Or is there a better way to solve this problemp

Negative 1158 pIm experimenting in Javascript with animating various elements using a cubicbezier timing function.p  pI know this is usually better done with CSS3, or a Javascript animation library.  Im simply using Javascript here to understand how bezier functions work, and teach myself about them.p  pSo, I get the basic concept, and Im using a simple bezier curve library written by a hrefhttpsgist.github.commckamey3783009 relnofollowStephen McKameya, which is a great Javascript port of the Webkit implementation.p  pIm having trouble understanding how I can actually emuseem this function to control an animation in Javascript.  So, starting with something very simple a basic black square that I can animate by moving it to the right, by incrementing its codestyle.leftcode propertyp  pstrongCSSstrongp  precode.parent      position relative      .foo      border 1px solid 000000     backgroundcolor black     height 200px     width 200px     position absolute  codepre  pstrongHTMLstrongp  precodeltdiv class  parentgt     ltdiv class  foo id  targetgtltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pOkay, so, given a cubic bezier function codebeziercode, defined as followsp  precode   function bezierp1x, p1y, p2x, p2y, x, duration  ...  codepre  pWhere p1x, p1y, p2x and p2y are the curve control points between 0 and 1.0, codexcode is the value of the codexcode coordinate, and codedurationcode is a duration in milliseconds.  The function returns the corresponding codeycode coordinate. Im trying to simply animate this black box by moving it code400pxcode to the right.p  pFor my first attempt, I use the standard ease bezier values, which CSS3 uses, so our codeeasecode bezier function could be written asp  precodefunction easex, duration      return function          Bezier.cubicBezier0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1.0, x, duration       codepre  pSo this should give us a slow start, then move fast, then end slowly.p  pOkay, so I assume the basic way to implement this is to use codewindow.setIntervalcode, and then for each interval, call the bezier function with a new value for x, and then apply the result somehow to the property we want to animate.p  pThe thing is, Im not sure what my x value is here.  I assume that in this situation, x is actually the emtimeem, and emyem is the delta between the old position and new position distance to move, but Im not really sure.  Im probably wrong.p  pAnyway, plugging this all in, Id write a function likep  precodevar startPos  0 var endPos  400  pixels var duration  400  milliseconds var millisecondsPerInterval  10  var target  document.getElementByIdtarget var t  0 var pos  0  var bezierFunction  Bezier.cubicBezier  var interval  window.setInterval     function          pos  pos  bezierFunction0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1.0, t  1000, duration  ease values         target.style.left  pos  millisecondsPerInterval  px         t  millisecondsPerInterval         if t  duration  window.clearIntervalinterval      ,     millisecondsPerInterval  codepre  pThis seems to work  the box slowly begins moving and then speeds up.  But then it just stops abruptly, rather than easing out.  So Im probably not applying this function correctly.  Im not even certain if codexcode is supposed to be my time value here, and codeycode is supposed to be the position delta distance to move, but that seems the only way to apply this that makes any sense.p  pSo, am I doing something wrong here  What is the correct way to apply a cubic bezier function to a property we want to animate using Javascriptp

Negative 1158 pI have a really big angularjs web application which loads large files when you first enter the site. The site is composed by a few SPAs, and every time the user change from one to the other this data is lost and has to be loaded again. Also, if the user presses refresh the data is also loaded again.p  pThis data will very unlikely change during the users session, so it would be great if we could persist it and reload only when theres an update. I know about local and session storage, but they have a 5000k or 10000k limit, which wont be enough. I would need aroung 20000k storage.p  pIs there any way to do thatp

Negative 1158 pIve been asked to refactor an Oracle report, a DB that Im not that familiar with. Part of the query has been running slowly and a contextswitch has been identified.

Negative 1158 pIm learning a hrefhttpprojectreactor.io relnofollow titleReactorReactora, and Im wondering how to achieve a certain behavior. Lets say I have a stream of incoming messages. Each message is associated with a certain entity and contains some data.p  precodeinterface Message      String getEntityId     Data getData  codepre  pMessages relating to different entities can be processed in parallel. However, messages pertaining to any single entity must be processed one at a time, i.e. processing of message 2 for entity codeabccode can not start until processing of message 1 for entity codeabccode has finished. While processing of a message is underway, further messages for that entiy should be buffered. Message for other entities can proceed unimpeded. One can think of it as there being on thread per entity running code like thisp  precodepublic void run      for            Blocks until theres a message available         Message msg  messageQueue.nextMessageForthis.entityId           Blocks until processing is finished         processMessagemsg       codepre  pHow can I achieve this with React without blocking The total message rate may be high, but message rate per entity will be very low. The set of entities can be very large, and is not necessarily known in advance.p  pI guess it might look something like this, but I dont know.p  precode     incomingMessages             .groupByMessagegetEntityId             .flatMapentityStream gt entityStream                      ...                      .mapmsg gt  process the message                       ...    public static StreamltMessagegt incomingMessages   ...   codepre

Negative 1158 pI have an application that is using the JPlayer Circle Player to play short audios for transcription purposes.  Each of these audios originates as a .vox file that has been converted to .wav by SoX.  When the Play button is pressed, the audio plays but the green circle does not display.  Once the clip has played, pressing play again does show the green circle advancing.p  pI assume that this is because either the original vox format or the wav format does not contain any length data so that player doesnt know this until it tries to play it.  Once it learns the length, the circle can display.p  pHow might this be overcome  Can the circle player somehow preload the audio to determine its length before playing  Is there something different I could be doing in the SoX conversion  Would converting to something other than WAV work better  JPlayer counsels against using WAV but doesnt say why, and it plays well enough except for this.  p  pOr is there something else Im doing wrongp  pstrongUPDATE 1strong after reading the original .vox file and the converted .wav file with soxi, it appears that duration data exists in both places, thus no reason the player cannot know this in advance.  So conversion would seem to be off the hook as the culprit.p  pstrongUPDATE 2strong I added some JPlayer event handlers for the loadedmetadata and play events which shows pretty clearly the problem described above.p  precodejqueryjplayer.bind.jPlayer.event.loadedmetadata , functionevent   Add a listener log the duration on load     console.logloadedmetadata this audio has a duration of   event.jPlayer.status.duration   seconds.       jqueryjplayer.bind.jPlayer.event.play , functionevent   Add a listener log the duration on play     console.logplay this audio has a duration of   event.jPlayer.status.duration   seconds.      codepre  pThis produced the following output in the logsp  precodeloadedmetadata this audio has a duration of 0 seconds. play this audio has a duration of 0 seconds. play this audio has a duration of 10.72 seconds. codepre  pindicating that the duration isnt known until the first playthrough.p  pstrongUPDATE 3 retracting UPDATE 1strong Although soxi is somehow able to extract duration data from the file, that doesnt necessarily mean that the HTML5 browser is able to do so.  A different algorithm may be in place there.  The conversion is back on the hook.  I cant see how it could be anything else.p  pI thought it might be because the Circle Player lives inside a modal dialog, but is instantiated when the page that invokes the modal dialog is loaded and only upon showing the modal dialog was the media loaded.  I changed that to a cleaner design where the Circle Player is instantiated every time the modal dialog is shown and the media loaded at that time and destroyed when the modal goes away, but the problem remains.p  pstrongSAMPLE FILEstrongp  pa hrefhttpsmega.co.nz1lsjya7Qi5G8fnhbZL4hvDGe8rifT1TZU1HJvpw7T7k5RvXpb9I relnofollowDownload sample filea for testing.

Of course, using undocumented APIs is not a favorite solution of mine since I wont know when Microsoft stops supporting it.pli lipRender the first process to a shared texture. I assume there is something like Apples IOSurface on Windows, but I havent checked yet. This is my last resort solution, since I prefer to have full isolation between the processes and they should not need to know about each other.

My question is not about how to do this I will probably figure it out, but rather how to solve it avoiding this.pli ul

Negative 1158 pI want to fulfill a promise with some other promise. The point is that I really want to get access to the still pending second empromiseem as soon as the first promise is fulfilled.

The file may not be available just yet e.g.,          if it has to be downloaded over the network but we can already ask          the user some more questions while the file is being obtained in the          background.          ...do some more user interaction...          return downloadProgress      .then  Wait for the download if any to complete.     functionfile           Do something with the file.       codepre  pThe function codepickFilecode displays a file picker where the user may pick a file either from their own hard drive or from a URL. It returns a promise codepickercode that is fulfilled as soon as the user has picked a file. At this point, we may still have to download the selected file over the network. Therefore, I cannot fulfill codepickercode with the selected file as resolution value. Instead, codepickercode should be fulfilled with another promise, codedownloadProgresscode, which in turn will eventually be fulfilled with the selected file.p  pFor completenes, heres a mock implementation of the codepickFilecode functionp  precodefunction pickFile      ...display the file picker...      var resolveP1  null      var p1  new Promise         functionresolve, reject              resolveP1  resolve                     Mock code to pretend the user picked a file     window.setTimeoutfunction          var p2  Promise.resolvethefile         resolveP1p2   lt PROBLEM I actually want to fulfill p1 with p2     , 3000      return p1  codepre  pThe problem in the marked line is that I would like to emfulfillem the promise codep1code with the new promise codep2code, but I only know how to emresolveem it. The a hrefhttpwww.ecmainternational.orgecma2626.0secpromiseresolvefunctionsdifference between fulfilling and resolvinga is that resolving first checks if the supplied value codep2code is again a promise. If it is, then fulfillment of codep1code will be deferred until codep2code is fulfilld, and then codep1code will be fulfilled with codep2codes resolution value instead of codep2code itself.p  pI could work around this issue by building a wrapper around codep2code, i.e. by replacing the linep  precode        resolveP1p2   lt PROBLEM I actually want to fulfill p1 with p2 codepre  pfrom the second code example byp  precode        resolveP1promise p2 codepre  pThen, in the first code example, Id have to replace the linep  precode        return downloadProgress codepre  pbyp  precode        return downloadProgress.promise codepre  pBut this seems like a bit of a hack when all I really want to do is just fulfill instead of resolve a promise.p  pId appreciate any suggestions.p
