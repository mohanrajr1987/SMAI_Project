Positive 379 pI am currently tackling this assignment for my computer science classp  pMake your own dynamic array template. It should allow creating contiguous arrays filled with things of the same type which you can extend without worrying about running out of space.p  pDo one version using malloc and free.p  pDo one version using new and delete.p  pMy version using new and delete works flawlessly however, in trying to convert my newdelete code to using mallocfree, I keep getting a seg fault.

Negative 379 pEvery time I start in deep in a C project, I end up with lots of events that really just need to pass a single item.  I stick with the codeEventHandlercodecodeEventArgscode practice, but what I like to do is have something likep  precodepublic delegate void EventHandlerltTgtobject src, EventArgsltTgt args  public class EventArgsltTgt EventArgs     private T item    public EventArgsT item      this.item  item       public T Item      get  return item      codepre  pLater, I can have myp  precodepublic event EventHandlerltFoogt FooChanged  public event EventHandlerltBargt BarChanged codepre  pHowever, it seems that the standard for .NET is to create a new delegate and codeEventArgscode subclass for each type of event.  Is there something wrong with my generic approach hr EDIT The reason for this post is that I just recreated this in a new project, and wanted to make sure it was ok.  Actually, I was recreating it as I posted.  I found that there is a generic codeEventHandlerltTEventArgscode, so you dont need to create the generic delegate, but you still need the generic codeEventArgsltTcode class, because codeTEventArgs EventArgscode. hr Another EDIT One downside to me of the builtin solution is the extra verbosityp  precodepublic event EventHandlerltEventArgsltFoogtgt FooChanged codepre  pvs.p  precodepublic event EventHandlerltFoogt FooChanged codepre  pIt can be a pain for clients to register for your events though, because the System namespace is imported by default, so they have to manually seek out your namespace, even with a fancy tool like Resharper...  Anyone have any ideas pertaining to thatp
Negative 379 pI am using VB6 and the Win32 API to write data to a file, this functionality is for the export of data, therefore write performance to the disk is the key factor in my considerations. As such I am using the codeFILEFLAGNOBUFFERINGcode and codeFILEFLAGWRITETHROUGHcode options when opening the file with a call to codeCreateFilecode.p  pcodeFILEFLAGNOBUFFERINGcode requires that I use my own buffer and write data to the file in multiples of the disks sector size, this is no problem generally, apart from the last part of data, which if it is not an exact multiple of the sector size will include character zeros padding out the file, how do I set the file size once the last block is written to not include these character zerosp  pI can use codeSetEndOfFilecode however this requires me to close the file and reopen it without using codeFILEFLAGNOBUFFERINGcode. I have seen someone talk about codeNtSetInformationFilecode however I cannot find how to use and declare this in VB6. codeSetFileInformationByHandlecode can do exactly what I want however it is only available in Windows Vista, my application needs to be compatible with previous versions of Windows.p
Negative 379 pThis is somewhat of a followup to an answer a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions26536activexcontroljavascriptherea.p  pI have a custom ActiveX control that is raising an event ReceiveMessage with a msg parameter that needs to be handled by Javascript in the web browser. Historically weve been able to use the following IEonly syntax to accomplish this on different projectsp  precodefunction MyControlReceiveMessagemsg     alertmsg  codepre  pHowever, when inside a layout in which the control is buried, the Javascript cannot find the control. Specifically, if we put this into a plain HTML page it works fine, but if we put it into an ASPX page wrapped by the codeltFormgtcode tag, we get a MyControl is undefined error. Weve tried variations on the followingp  precodevar GetControl  document.getElementByIdMyControl function GetControlReceiveMessagemsg     alertmsg  codepre  p... but it results in the Javascript error GetControl is undefined.p  pWhat is the proper way to handle an event being sent from an ActiveX control Right now were only interested in getting this working in IE. This has to be a custom ActiveX control for what were doing.p  pThanks.p

Negative 379 pIts been a few years since Ive taken a deep look at Mono. When I last took a look, it wasnt quite there as far as BCL implementation and the tools available were limited. I have a specific need now to do some cross platform development, and was wondering what the community thought about Mono as a choice in the enterprise. Since Ive been doing most of my dev work the past several years in .Net, Mono seems to be a natural choice. I dont want to push a technology that wont stand up to the test, however.p  pNote Im NOT talking about a small or even medium sized project. Im talking about a large scale enterprise application that will be distributed globally, utilizing a service oriented approach. Additionally, how stable are services written on the Mono platformp  pYour input is appreciatedp

Negative 379 pSo I have about 4,000 word docs that Im attempting to extract the text from and insert into a db table.  This works swimmingly until the processor encounters a document with the code.doccode file extension but determines the file is actually an RTF.  Now I know POI doesnt support RTFs which is fine, but I do need a way to determine if a code.doccode file is actually an RTF so that I can choose to ignore the file and continue processing.p  pIve tried several techniques to overcome this, including using ColdFusions MimeTypeUtils, however, it seems to base its assumption of the mimetype on the file extension and still classifies the RTF as applicationmsword.  Is there any other way to determine if a code.doccode is an RTF  Any help would be hugely appreciated.p

Negative 379 pConsider the C program composed of two files,p  pf1.cp  precodeint x codepre  pf2.cp  precodeint x2 codepre  pMy reading of paragraph 6.9.2 of a hrefhttpwww.openstd.orgJTC1SC22wg14wwwdocsn1124.pdfthe C99 standarda is that this program should be rejected. In my interpretation of 6.9.2, variable codexcode is tentatively defined in codef1.ccode, but this tentative definition becomes an actual definition at the end of the translation unit, and in my opinion, should therefore behave as if codef1.ccode contained the definition codeint x0code.p  pWith all compilers and, importantly, linkers I was able to try, this is not what happens. All compilation platforms I tried do link the above two files, and the value of codexcode is 2 in both files.p  pI doubt this happens by accident, or just as an easy feature to provide in addition to what the standard requires. If you think about it, it means there is special support in the linker for those global variables that do not have an initializer, as opposed to those explicitly initialized to zero. Someone told me that the linker feature may be necessary to compile Fortran anyway. That would be a reasonable explanation.p  pAny thoughts about this Other interpretations of the standard Names of platforms on which files codef1.ccode and codef2.ccode refuse to be linked togetherp  pNote this is important because the question occurs in the context of static analysis. If the two files may refuse to be linked on some platform, the analyzer should complain, but if every compilation platform accepts it then there is no reason to warn about it.p

Negative 379 pId like top  ol liMake commonly required services visible to all classes that need them,li liwith a minimum of boilerplate, andli liwithout sacrificing testabilityli ol  pIts a small project and I think DI might be overkill, but maybe Im wrong  Anyhow, I have been focusing on the a hrefhttpmartinfowler.comarticlesinjection.htmlUsingAServiceLocatorServiceLocator pattern as described by Martin Fowlerap  pIn a client class constructor, I have something like thisp  precodethisgtdb  LocatorgetDb thisgtlog  LocatorgetLogger codepre  pThen the rest of the class methods access the service through those member attributes, e.g.p  precodethisgtfooModel  new fooModelthisgtdb fooItem1234  thisgtfooModelgtfindById1234 codepre  pHowever I would also like this level of visibility for model objects like fooModel above because they are accessed from several different places and there is no need to have more than one instance.p  pSo my initial thought was to extend Locator to have a codegetFooModelcode but now it seems Im violating the OpenClosed Principle, since Ill have to modify Locator every time I introduce a new model class.p  pTo satisfy OCP, I could use the Dynamic Service Locator also described on Fowlers page however Im not totally sold on this for the same reasons as him, i.e. its not explicit enough.p  pAnother solution would be to just make all my models methods static.  Sop  precodefooItem1234  FooModelfindById1234 codepre  pI like this because its zero boilerplate.  I can just create a new model class and start calling it from anywhere with a single line.  But now the model depends on Locator to find its DB connection and Im not sure how I feel about that.  For one, if I ever needed to have two fooModels open on separate database connections, it would be a mess andor impossible.  That said, I dont actually need to do that currently so this option seems a little tempting.p  pFinally, theres DI.  But like I said above I think it might be too much for this little project.p  pConclusion Im a little stuck here and would appreciate some advice from the gurus of StackOverflowp

Negative 379 pafter weeks of having this issue I finally decided to ask for a solution to the following problemp  pIn the .aspx page you can set  p  precodelt MasterType VirtualPathMastername.master gt codepre  pThis results in an auto generated property in the .aspx.designerp  precodepublic new Mastername Master      get          return Masternameebase.Master       codepre  pWorks perfectly fine. But if I do changes in the .aspx file, the property will be new auto generated and it looks like the followingp  precodepublic new NAMESPACE1.Mastername Master              get                  return NAMESPACE1.Masternamebase.Master                       codepre  pCompiling will not be possible afterwards, because the class for the MasterPage cannot be resolved at the given namespace. The masterpage has NAMESPACE1 as namespace.p  pEvery contentpage has the same NAMESPACE1. The autogenerated property tries to look for the masterpage class in NAMESPACE1.NAMESPACE1 which will fail, due to it does not exist. Of course I can remove the first NAMESPACE1. to make the app compilable again, but it just sucks to do this nearly every time I make changes in the .aspx file.p  pIs there a way to avoid this problem The only way I can think of, is to ignore the auto generated property and make a explicit cast everytime I want have access to the masterpage.p  pEdit Im using Visual Studio 2008 Professional SP1.p

Simply once I add a post I pass few tags along that post and user. Later I would like to be able to count tabs for each user and post. Something very similar to Stack Overflow.p  pI suppose that the tagtext should be unique Is if effective that I run a function each time I submit a new post to go through the tags table to check if a tag already exists, and if yes, return its tagid so I can insert it into userposttag table.p  pIs this maybe a bad approach to tackle this kind of issue.p  pAll suggestions are welcome.p

Negative 379 pIve got a bit of an odd problem. I have a project in C thats basically a wrapper for a third party DLL like thisp  pMyLibrarybr loads DLLAbr loads DLLBp  pI load DLLA with LoadLibrary, wrap several of its functions and generate my own DLL. Ive tested this in a C project and a C project. Both do everything theyre supposed to do load DLLA, make a couple of function calls, and indirectly load DLLB. The problem is when I build a DLL for java and make the calls through JNI. Everything runs like it should no java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError, but when it comes time for DLLA to load DLLB it doesnt work. From debugging, the loading of DLLB happens on a function call in DLLA that takes a callback. When called from Java, this function call seems to fail the function pointer is fine and the actual call goes off without a hitch, and I get an odd popup window saying DLLB failed to load, and my program is left waiting for a callback that never happens. I can explicitly load DLLB just fine both from Java and from C and Ive checked every possible path, path variable, and tried placing the dlls everywhere to see if it could be looking somewhere funny. Im pretty sure its not a path problem.p  pUltimately I dont know how DLLA is loading DLLB and I cant figure out why everything works fine in C and C, but not in Java. Im absolutely flummoxed. It could still be something specific to my setup although Ive looked as hard as I can look, but Im throwing this scenario out there to see if anyone has run into a similar problem.p  pDavep

Negative 379 pIm currently faced with a very unusual design problem, and hope that a developer wiser than myself might be able to offer some insight.p  h2Backgroundh2  pWithout being too specific, Ive been hired by a nonprofit organisation to assist with the redevelopment of their legacy, but very valuable in terms of social value software. The development team is unlike any Ive encountered in my time as a software developer, and is comprised of a small number of developers and a larger group of nonprogramming domain experts. What makes the arrangement unusual is that the domain experts lets call them content creators, use custom tooling, some of which is based around a prolog expert system engine, to develop web based software componentsforms.p  h2The Problemh2  pThe system uses a very awkward postback model to perform logical operations server side and return new formsresults. It is slow, and prone to failure. Simple things, like creating html forms using the existing tooling is emmuchem more arduous than it should be. As the demand for a more interactive, and performant experience grows, the software developers are finding increasingly that they have to circumvent the expert systemvisual tooling used by the content creators, and write new components by hand in javascript. The content creators feel increasingly that their hands are tied, as they are now unable to contribute new components.p  h2Design approach TraditionalTypicalh2  pI have been advocating for the complete abandonment of the previous model and the adoption of a typical software development process. As mentioned earlier, the project has naturally evolved towards this as the nonprogrammatic development tooling has become incapable of meeting the needs of the business. p  pThe content creators have a very valuable contribution to make however, and I would like to see them focusing on formally specifying the expected behaviour of the software with tools like Cucumber, instead of being involved in implementation. p  h2Design approach Nonprogrammatich2  pMy coworker, who I respect a great deal and suspect is far more knowledgeable than me, feels that the existing process is fine and that we just need to build better tooling. I cant help but feel however that there is something fundamentally flawed with this approach. I have yet to find one instance, either historical or contemporary where this model of software development has been successful. COBOL was developed with the philosophy of allow business peopledomain experts to write applications without the need for a programmer, and to my mind all this did was create a new kind of programmer  the COBOL programmer. If it was possible to develop effective systems allowing nonprogrammers to create nontrivial applications, surely the demand for programmers would be much lower The only frameworks that I am aware of that roughly fit this model are SAPs Smart Forms and Microsofts Dynamix AX  both of which are very domain specific ERP systems.p  h2DSLs, Templating Languagesh2  pSomething of a compromise between the two concepts would be to implement some kind of DSL as a templating language. Im not even sure that this would be successful however, as all of the content creators, with one exception, are completely non technical.p  pIve also considered building a custom IDE based on Visual Studio or Net Beans with graphicaltoolbox style tooling.p  h2Thoughtsh2  pIs nonprogrammatic development a fools errand Will this always result in something unsatisfactory, requiring hands on development from a programmer p  pMany thanks if youve taken the time to read this, and Id certainly appreciate any feedback.p

Negative 379 pI am building a windows forms application where a very consistent look and feel across all modules is of very high priority. Apart from standard .NET controls it uses a lot of third party controls from different vendors. I would like to have the ability to change the entire look and feel of the application in one go, may be with upgraded versions of the software. Very much like skinning, but generally I have seen that skinning abilities by third party providers work well with their set of controls only while I have controls from multiple vendors.p  pI am planning to build a complete set of user controls inherited from either .NET controls or third party controls where relevant, and use our set of controls only. That way I might have to create a lot of controls e.g. Text, DropDown, List, Grid, DTPicker, etc. etc. but I guess I will have a reasonable command over the look and feel, i.e. I can propagate any changes in the base e.g. use Tahoma font in all places instead of MS Sans Serif by just rebuilding the complete app.p  pI was also thinking that the ability to change the font across the app alone, among others, is something that would cost almost all types of controls to be inherited.p  pQuestionsp  ol lipDo you feel that this is the right way control inheritance to proceed towards consistent look and feel across an app pli lipDo you support the ability to change the entire application font in one shot as a good requirementpli ol  pSuggestions, comments are greatly appreciated. p

Protected, internal and private setters allow internal control to be maintained over writing to the object model. p  pWhen creating stronginterfacesstrong while making an API over my object model, Ive started considering the same issues about immutability.

Negative 379 pa hrefhttpgoo.glzMiYs relnofollowhttpgoo.glzMiYsap  pHello all, I managed to implement the menu above partially menu opens, items appear, items move to destination with the help of jQuery and jQuery Radmenu plugin.

There is the plugins afterAnimation option but it wasnt useful because it triggers after each code.radmenunextcode  in other words too often. I also tried to work with jQuerys codequeuecode and codedequeuecode but didnt have any luck.p  pI would highly appreciate it if I can get help on how to solve this problem or for pointing me in the right direction where I should look. In the last days, I spent a fair amount of time searching for similar menus but couldnt find anything similar to what I want to do considering it isnt an extremely exotic idea.

Negative 379 pI got fk parentchild row deletionupdate errors while performing deletion on parent row.So  I removed related child records from database manually. But still i am getting errors.

Negative 379 pThe main idea is that I would like to make a world map that shows activites as they progress on a timescale from a database.

Negative 379 pSo what im trying to do is compare bank transactions to orders in my database and if they match change the order status to confirmed.p  pThe transactions come in a xml formatp  precodetransactiongtusernumber this is the social security number of the one who made the transaction transactiongtamount this is the amount transfered codepre  pI need to compare the usernumber to the usernumbers associated with orders in my database. I could do that by making two arrays with those numbers and use codearrayintersectcode to find the numbers that are present in both the database and in the transactions xml.p  pNow i would have the usernumbers of the ones who have made a transaction but I still need to see if they transfered the correct amount.p  pI will be able to finish this but I somehow feel that there is a simpler solution by using the usernumber as the index in the array and the amount as the value and create two arrays like that and compare them.p  pCan anyone help me here before I write some complicated, slow and messy code.p  pThanksp

Negative 379 pI am totally new to programming with Scala and I have the following problemp  pI need a HashMap which can contain many data types Int, String, etc... In C I would use BOOSTs MultiMap. I have heard that in Scala there is a MultiMap trait available. Basically what I want to to is the followingp  precodeval map  HashMap[String, ListBuffer[]] codepre  pThe concrete datatype of the ListBuffers elements are to be determined during runtime. When I test this implementation in console the following worksp  precodescalagt val a  new HashMap[String, ListBuffer[]] a scala.collection.mutable.HashMap[String,scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer[]]  Map  scalagt val b  new ListBuffer[String] b scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer[String]  ListBuffer  scalagt val c  new ListBuffer[Int] c scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer[Int]  ListBuffer  scalagt b  String res0 b.type  ListBufferString  scalagt c  1 res1 c.type  ListBuffer1  scalagt a  String Buffer gt b res2 a.type  MapString Buffer,ListBufferString  scalagt a  This is an Int Buffer gt c res3 a.type  MapString Buffer,ListBufferString, This is an Int Buffer,ListBuffer1 codepre  pSo basically it works. My first question is, whether there is a possiblity to implement the same behaviour in Scala without using the ListBuffer as layer of indirection.p  pE.g getting a Map with the following content MapString, 1,String, String value, ...p  pWhen I am now trying to use the ListBufferImplementation above, I get the following type mismatch errorp  precodefound    1 where type 1 required 3 where type 3 codepre  pI am basically trying to do the followingp  pI use an iterator to iterate over the maps keysp  precodevar valueIds  new ListBuffer[Int] val iterator  map.keys iterator.foreachkey gt  valueIds  setValuemap.applykey.last  codepre  psetValue returns Int and is a method which has to do something with the ListBuffers last element.p  pDoes anybody know how to fix the above mentioned type mismatchp  pThanks for your helpp  pRegardsp

Negative 379 pHey all, I know there are a number of tutorials of implementing a custom adapter, but I am not convinced that this is right for me.  I have a list view of a custom item layout consisting of two TextViews and a CheckBox.  I have the following codep  precodelist.setOnItemClickListenernew OnItemClickListener         Override         public void onItemClickAdapterViewltgt adapter, View view, int position,                 long rowid               CheckBox c  CheckBox view.findViewByIdR.id.itemchkbox             c.setCheckedc.isChecked             String n  TextView view.findViewByIdR.id.itemcharName.getText.toString             String p  TextView view.findViewByIdR.id.itemplayerName.getText.toString             ... codepre  pWhen I tap on an item in the list, a check box is fired and is checked, but its not the right one.  Its not random, either.  The CheckBox that is fired is always on the opposite side, mirrored at the center of the list.  For example, if I had a list ofp  p0 1 2 3 4p  pAnd tapped 0, 4s check would fire.  If I tapped 1, 3s check would fire.  If I tap 2, 2s check fires.  Even stranger, if I tap 0 twice, 3 checks, then 0 checks.  Tap a third time, 3 unchecks.   A forth  0 unchecks.  This continues in pattern with all cases.  I cant quite figure out what is going on.p  pPlease note that the strings n and p both come out correctly.  In other words, tapping 0 would retrieve the string for name in the corresponding list item.  Its only the CheckBoxes which are out of whack.  Any ideasp

Negative 379 pOk so I know generally its not good idea to have a DateTime column as your PK, however for my situation I believe it makes more sense than having a suggogate key in the Fact Table.p  pThe reasons are...p  ol liThe data inserted into the fact table is always sequential. i.e. I would never insert date time value that is older than the last value already in Fact table.li liThe date time field is not the only column of the PK composite PK, The PK is of course itself and the dimension FKs surrogate key.li liThe way i be querying the data is nearly always based on time.li liA surrogate key on the Fact table would tell me nothing about the row. Each row is already unique and to find that particular fact I would always filter on the Date time first and the values in the dimensions.li liThere is no separate datetime dimension table. No requirement now or in the foreseeable future to have named points in time etc.li ol  pSide notes  time will be in UTC and using SQL 2008 R2.p  pWhat Im asking is are giving the situation  what are the disadvantages to doing this Will I come up against unforeseen issues  Is this actaully a good thing to be doing when querying that data back laterp  pWould like to know peoples view points on a DateTime field as the first column of a composite PK.p

Negative 379 pI just read about the LLVM project and that it could be used to do static analysis on CC codes using the analyzer Clang which the front end of LLVM. I wanted to know if it is possible to extract all the accesses to memoryvariables, local as well as global in the source code using LLVM. Is there any inbuilt library present in LLVM which I could use to extract this information. If not please suggest me how to write functions to do the same.existing source code, reference, tutorial, example...

I understand that to insert function like above I will have to first get the IR and then run an instrumentation pass on the IR which will insert such calls into the IR, but I dont really know how to achieve it. Please suggest me with examples how to go about it. Also I understand that once I compile the program into the IR, it would be really difficult to get 11 mapping between my original program and the instrumented IR. So, is it possible to reflect the changes made in the IR  because of instrumentation  into the original program.p  pIn order to get started with LLVM pass and how to make one on my own, I looked at an example of a pass that adds runtime checks to LLVM IR loads and stores, the SAFECodes loadstore instrumentation pass httpllvm.orgviewvcllvmprojectsafecodetrunkincludesafecodeLoadStoreChecks.hviewmarkup and a hrefhttpllvm.orgviewvcllvmprojectsafecodetrunklibInsertPoolChecksLoadStoreChecks.cppviewmarkuphttpllvm.orgviewvcllvmprojectsafecodetrunklibInsertPoolChecksLoadStoreChecks.cppviewmarkupa.

Negative 379 pAt work we want our next generation product to be based on a graph database. Im looking for suggestions as to what database engine might be appropriate for our new projectp  pOut product is intended to keep track of a large number of prices for goods. Heres a simplistic example of what it does  supposing you wanted to estimate the price of gasoline in the UK  you know that Gasoline is refined from crudeoil. If you new the price of crude oil in the UK you could estimate the price of anything simply by adding the cost of refining, transporting etc. Actually things are more complex because there are a number of sources of crudeoil and hundreds of refined oil products. The prices of oil products can be affected by the availability of other energy sources e.g. nuclear, wind, natural gas and the demand. Its kind of complexp  pThe idea is that we want to model the various interrelated goods and their costs of refining, transportation etc as an asyclic directed graph. The idea being, when an event causes a price to change then we want to be quickly able to determine what kinds of things are affected and recalculate those prices ASAP. p  pEssentially we need a database which can represent the individual commodities as nodes in the graph. Each node will store a number of curves and surfaces of information pertaining to the product. p  pWe want to represent the various costs amp transformations e.g. refining, transportation as labels on the edges. As with the nodes, the information we want to store could be quite complex  not just single values but curves and surfaces.  p  pThe calculations we do are all linear with respect to the size of the objects, however since the graph could be very big we need to be able to traverse the graph very quickly. p  pWe are Java and Python centric  ideally we are after a product that runs on the JVM but has really good APIs for both Python and Java. We dont care so much about other languages... but .Net would be nice to have even though it might be years before we get round to doing something with it.p  pWed definitely like something which was highperformance  but more importantly the system needs to have a degree of hardware fault tolerance. For example, wed like to distribute the database across a number of physical servers. In the event that any of the servers go down wed like to be able to continue without an interruption. p  pOh, and we are really lazy. We dont want to spend much time writing infrastructure  so if the database came with tools that allow us to do as much as possible of this kind of thing with very little work thats fine by us. It would also be a real bonus if there was a grid technology associated with the graph DB, that way we could push a sequence of recalculate jobs onto a compute grid and have much of our calculation done in paralell. p  pSo, thats a description of the kind of thing we want to build. What I want to know is whether there are any mature technologies which will help us achieve this. As I mentioned before, we have a preference for Python amp JVM, however if the technology is really good and comes with great bindings for Python  Java wed consider almost anything.p

With the new appearance property you can do it in only one place for all navigation bars in your app. For instance if you want to customize your Navigation bar background image you could do it like thisp  precode[[UINavigationBar appearance] setBackgroundImage    [UIImage imageNamedMyImageName] forBarMetricsUIBarMetricsDefault]  codepre  pThis will set the background image of ALL navigation bars within your application. With the codebarMetricscode you specify whether you want the image to be used also in landscape mode or not.p  pIf you want to specify the appearance to be applied only in some view controllers there is also a method in the docs to control that by specifying where your objects are locatedp  precode[[UIBarButtonItem appearanceWhenContainedIn     [ABPeoplePickerNavigationController class], nil] setTintColormyNavBarColor] codepre  pAlso worth to mention is, if you have single customized instances, differing from your appearance settings, theses instances will not be effected by the appearance proxy.  p  hr  pstrongSome questionsstrongp  pstronga How do I know which properties of a class work with the appearance propertystrong For e.g. since codeUITableViewcode conforms to the UIAppearance protocol I was thinking I could do something likep  precode[[UITableView appearance] setBackgroundColormytableViewColor] codepre  pto manipulate the background color of all my table views, but I cant  p  pstrongb Is there a list of all classes that are manipulatable with the appearance propertystrong p  pstrongc At what point is the appearance customization being calledstrong I was hoping to make changes threw the appearance property at runtime, but unfortunately the changes arent taking place.  p

Negative 379 pfrom wiki page of insertion sortp  blockquote   pSome divideandconquer algorithms such as quicksort and mergesort sort by recursively dividing the list into smaller sublists which are   then sorted. A useful optimization in practice for these algorithms is   to use insertion sort for sorting small sublists, where insertion sort   outperforms these more complex algorithms. The size of list for which   insertion sort has the advantage varies by environment and   implementation, but is typically between eight and twenty elements.p blockquote  pthe quote from wiki has one reason is that, the small lists from merge sort are not worse case for insertion sort.p  pI want to just ignore this reason.p  pI knew that if the array size is small, Insertion sort On2 has chance to beat Merge Sort On log n.p  pI thinknot sure this is related to the constants in Tn p  pInsertion sort Tn  c1n2 c2nc3p  pMerge Sort Tn  n log n  cnp  pnow my question is, on the same machine, same case worse case, how to find out the largest element number, let insertion sort beat merge sortp

Negative 379 pAccording to Fowler a hrefhttpmartinfowler.comeaaCatalogrepository.htmlherea, a repository mediates between the domain and data mapping layers, acting like an inmemory domain object collection.  So, for example, in my Courier Service application, when a new run is submitted, my application service creates a new Run aggregate root object, populates it with values from the request then adds it to the RunRepository before calling the Unit of Work to save the changes to the database.  When a user wants to view the list of current runs, I query the same repository and return a denormalized DTO representing the information.p  pHowever, when looking at CQRS, the query would not hit the same repository.  Instead, it would perhaps go directly against the data store and always be denormalized.  And my command side would evolve to a NewRunCommand and Handler that would create and populate a NewRun domain object then persist the information to the data store.p  pemSo the first question is where do repositories fit into the CQRS model if we arent maintaining an inmemory collection cache, if you will of domain objectsemp  pConsider the case where the information submitted to my application service contains nothing but a series of ID values that the service must resolve in order to build the domain object.  For example, the request contains the ID  of the courier assigned to the run.  The service must lookup the actual Courier object based on the ID value and assign the object to the NewRun using the AssignCourier method which validates the courier and performs other business logic.p  pemThe other question is, given the separation for queries and potential absence of repositories, how does the application service perform the lookup to find the Courier domain objectemp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pBased on some additional reading and thought after Dennis comment, Ill rephrase my questions.p  pIt appears to me that CQRS encourages repositories that are merely facades over the data access and data storage mechanisms.  They give the appearance of a collection like Fowler describes but are not managing the entities inmemory as Dennis pointed out.  This means that every operation on the repository is passthrough, yesp  pemHow does a Unit of Work fit into this approach  Typically a UoW is used to commit changes made to a repository right but if the repository isnt maintaining the entities inmemory, then what role does a UoW haveemp  pemWith regards to a write operation, would the command handler have a reference to the same repository, a different repository or perhaps a UoW instead of a repositoryemp

Negative 379 pUsed to developing in PHP, and have little experience in ASP, so please bare with mep  pIm working on a project for a client whos site was developed years ago with .asp.p  pI am implementing a new design htmlcss and have been going through the .asp pages and removing the old HTML and replacing it with the new code, developed by me.p  pThe Pages show no change when the page is loaded live on the website. When I open the .asp file in a text editor, the new code is there. Ive read up on this and it seems like the server may be caching the .asp files, but I do not know how to clear this cache, as I am simply editing the files in a simple text editor textmate.p  pAny suggestions p  pThanksp

Negative 379 pI collect realtime signals, compute derived signals and store both raw and derived data in a circular buffer, so I hold only last million of samples. p  pSometimes I need to serialize current values for all signals.

It can be an unboxed array of floats. Haskell can derive codeFunctorcode instances for me, so I can use codefmapcode to fetch last codeSignalValuecode from every codeSignalBuffercode and pass the structure to codeAesoncode to serialize.p  pHow do I implement a circular buffer API for codeSignalBuffercode so I can push new values to all the buffers when new ticks arrive Id like to conserve memory, so I think I have to use unboxed arrays. Is it advantageous to use mutable unboxed arrays codeSTUArraycode so array updates dont pile up in memory Is it possible to use mutable arrays in this setting at all Im ready to change codeMyDatacode and codeCurrentSignalscode to whatever does the job.p  pI know how to implement circular buffers, the question is how to elegantly apply the updates to codeMyDatacode.p  pIm thinking of something likep  precodetype UpdateFunc a  MyData gt SignalValue gt Modifier SignalBuffer  updateAllBuffers  D0 UpdateFunc gt Modifier MyData codepre  pSome signals are convolutions of other signals not real convolutions, but a similar kind of processing. To update a buffer for a signal I need to access buffers of other signals  thats why UpdateFunc accepts codeMyDatacode and codeSignalValuecode and returns a buffer modification function.p  pcodeupdateAllBufferscode then zips codeD0 UpdateFunccode and codeMyDatacode to get new codeMyDatacode.p  pOf course Im ready to use whatever codeModifiercode fits my task  it can be a function, a monadic value etc.p

If the user clicks the button and successfully logs in, I replace the login button on the server side with a logout button. The problem is, if I press the browser back button, the login button is still displayed. Subsequently loaded noncached pages correctly show the logout button.p  pIm presuming this is because when I press back, the page is coming from cache Is there a way I can refresh the header bar so it shows the logout button on cached pages too I dont think I can just refresh the entire page in question because I dont know which pages the user has visited before they login.p

Negative 379 pIm writing a specification for a toy package Im writing, and while most of the spec is guaranteeing that various structs in the package satisfy the primary public interface, I am also interested in specifying the methods that the interface must require I know this is more than a little pedantic, but I figured it would be a neat experiment, and would apply pressure to keep the public interface stable.p  pThis is my first tryp  precodetype Roller interface          Min  int   type minS struct  func m minS Min int return 0 func m minS Max int return 0  func RollerSpecc gospec.Context           var r Roller  minS          c.Specifyhas a minimum value., func                  , ok  r.interfaceMin int                 c.Expectok, Equals, true                   c.Specifyhas a maximum value., func                  , ok  r.interfaceMax int                 c.Expectok, Equals, true                   c.Specifyhas an expected value., func                  , ok  r.interfaceExp int                 c.Expectok, Equals, true                   c.Specifycan be rolled., func                  , ok  r.interfaceRoll int                 c.Expectok, Equals, true           codepre  pAs you can see, my codeRollercode interface only requires codeMincode but codeminScode implements both codeMincode and codeMaxcode. I pass the first two specs, even though codeRunnercode doesnt satisfy codeinterfaceMax intcode because the dummy type I use to test it does. Likewise, declaring r without a base type causes it to fail all specs.p  pIt is obvious why Go would have type assertion between interfaces work on the actual stored type, but its not what Im looking for here. Ive also checked the reflect package, but it seems like it only inspects structs as well. Is there a way to programmatically check whether an interface requires a given method without pulling in the parse package myself and crawling the parse tree for the method namep

Negative 379 pIm trying to test a service of mine that is called GetUsersForRole. It takes in a simple string and is passes this off to my RoleRepository to deal with NHibernate and get a collection of Roles with the passed in string for its RoleName. To do this, I have a Find function on my RoleRepository that calls this codep  precodeICriteria crit  rb.unitOfWork.Session.CreateCriteriatypeofEntity crit.SetCacheablefalse foreach object[] criteriaItem in criteria     crit.AddExpression.EqstringcriteriaItem[0], criteriaItem[1]   return crit.List.CastltEntitygt codepre  pSo the code above will return a list of roles and within that, there is a property defined as Iesi.Collections.ISet called Users.

Now this becomes a major issue in my ISetToIEnumerable class. My source is coming across typed as Iesi.Collections.HashedSet. p  pI know that I will not be able to type my mock using the NHibernate.Collection.PersistantSet because of the lack of an NHibernate session instance.

Negative 379 pstrongThe question up frontstrongp  pCan we directly access the fontweight and fontstyle information for an attributed string Or can we create a new string for which we are able to set this informationp  pstrongThe explanationstrongp  pIn iOS 6, you can toggle a selection as bold or italic. But the way this works is vexing it does not change the NSFontAttributeName that Apple has exposed to us changing the font name from, for instance, HelveticaNeue to HelveticaNeueBold. Instead, it preserves the fontfamily as Helvetica Neue and changes the fontweight to bold in the style string. If you were to ask an instance of attributed text for its description, you would see something like this for its font informationp  precodeNSFont  ltUICFFont 0x1fbc53a0gt fontfamily Helvetica Neue fontweight bold fontstyle normal fontsize 16px codepre  pThis creates a problem. We cannot change the font while preserving bold and italic style information. If you jump through the hoops of scanning the old attributed string for style info, creating a new string with a new font, and then changing the font attribute name using, for instance, CourierBold for everywhere you want it to be bold, you create a new problem if you try to toggle the font back to normal not bold you will instead have a font name like CourierBold emANDem a fontweight of bold, because the style information was not yet set to bold. And toggling will not, of course, change the font name. So youve essentially created a font that can no longer be changed when the user toggles the selected text. The user will press the bold button in the contextual menu, but it will do nothing, because the boldness has now been hardcoded into the font name, you might say.p  pIf you go the other route and try to override toggleBoldface and toggleItalic in your UITextView, it does not seem possible to actually prevent the style information in the style string from being changed. You cannot, it seems, change the font name alone during the toggle event.p  pSo, again, the question can we just access the fontweight and fontstyle information directly somehow Or can we create a new string for which we are able to set this information This would solve the problem of trying to switch from one font to another and preserving style info.p  pstrongAnd a double clarificationstrongp  pWe are talking about iOS. When you set an attributed strings font attribute NSFontAttributeName for some range of characters, internally iOS creates an NSFont with a style string. The style string will read fontweight normal fontstyle normal if you have set a font attribute yourself. But this style string is where the bold and italic information set in a UITextView by toggling is stored.p

Negative 379 pSo, Ive been making a small demo program in java using opengl just as an exercise. All was going well until I implemented getTime and getDelta functions to calculate how much time each frame takes. I then applied it to all my movement calculations by multiplying their speed with getDelta and it works well, only that when frames randomly slightly drop and getDelta returns a slightly larger value, my calculations start outputting really weird values which are still in the range of the movement the calculation calculates but incorrect, that happens for a few frames until the framerate goes up to normal 250FPS in this case and the movement continues normally and even from the exact position. I have no idea what could cause this since the getDelta seems to function properlyp  pHeres some codep  precodeprivate void movementCalculationsdouble delta       sinInc  0.0015     sinInc2  0.010      xMove[0]  xSpeed  float Math.sinMath.toDegreessinInc  100  delta  7500     yMove[0]  ySpeed  float Math.sinMath.toDegreessinInc  200  Math.PI  delta  2500     zMove[0]  zSpeed  float Math.sinMath.toDegreessinInc  200  delta  1250      for int i  1 ilt16 i          xMove[i]  xSpeed  float Math.sinsinInc2  128  Math.PI  i2  delta  WIDTH  16         yMove[i]  ySpeed  float Math.sinsinInc2  64  Math.PI  i  delta  HEIGHT  4           xMove[16]  xSpeed  float Math.sinsinInc2  64  Math.PI  2  delta  WIDTH  8     yMove[16]  ySpeed  float Math.sinsinInc2  32  Math.PI  2  delta  HEIGHT  4      xMove[17]  xSpeed  float Math.sinsinInc2  32  Math.PI  2  delta  HEIGHT  10  codepre  pIn the following debug output, Delta 4.0 is the normal value for 250FPS, then FPS drops and suddenly xMove[17] returns a nearly as large but NEGATIVE valuep  pcode Last frame in milliseconds 231884072 Delta 4.0 xMove[17] 164.297 Last frame in milliseconds 231884077 Delta 5.0 xMove[17] 160.83817 Last frame in milliseconds 231884080 Delta 3.0 xMove[17] 0.7198944 Last frame in milliseconds 231884084 Delta 4.0 xMove[17] 162.12277 codep  pAnd if not thats enough, heres a working JAR exectuable of the application which has everything for running it inside the JAR so you can see yourself a hrefhttpharha.us.tofilesfilespublicStarfieldExe.jar relnofollowhttpharha.us.tofilesfilespublicStarfieldExe.jarap  pI just cant figure out whats wrong or is there even anything wrong in my code at allp

Negative 379 pIm new with this javascript and dijit. p  pMy problem In my jsfunction Im building up a dijit.Dialog, using parameters that has been sent to the function.  One of the parameters is a href to en external xhtmlfile that contains only the text thats supposed to be shown in the dialog. Now, I want to add a div with one more link to the dialog, in the containerNode with a link thats supposed to be specific for every single user.  The problem is that I can se that the added div is there until I reach dialog.show, after that it disapears. The text from the xhtml takes over. If I put it in the domNode like the button it shows up in the wrong place.

Negative 379 pI have a program I made with an SQL database.  Everything works fine in VS 2010.  But then I publish it and it throws up an error saying it cannot find my database.  I used DataDirectory when I wrote the string for it so I searched for my database file.p  pI found a folder with my database an the application file in it.  I double clicked it and what do ya know, works fine.  My only problems is all the shortcuts that the install makes dont work, they point to an empty folder.  Is there a way to make them linked to this good folder that the installer makesp  pI notice its looking for my database under a filepath under the folder name data.  In the AppDataLocal on my comp where the application is installed to there are 2 folders.  One leads to my app, the other one leads to nothing, and is labled data.  It seems my program keeps looking in there, but like I said, if I follow the other path and run the .exe right from that folder it runs fine.p

Negative 379 pThis is maybe so silly. I have a boolean variable inside the main method. By calling another method of this class or another class I want my boolean value to be modified in the main method. I do this but the change happens only in the called methodlocally, not the callermain. I think this is because of the passbyvalue feature of java. I even tried Boolean type, but the same problem therep  pActually Ill use this to manage the ordering of concurrent threads. The main processor will check for the boolean value of every thread to see if it is ok to continue and tick the clock. After ticking the clock the main will make the vars false and will wait until the vars are again true. the subthreads will start their task if the boolean value of them each is false. After the task is done they will make the vars to true so the main processor is able to tick again. So I want something without a return.

Negative 379 pSo, Im trying to use pymssql to connect to a SQL Server database from my Linux box. The database can only be reached from inside my companys private network. It is set up to accept SQL Server authentication and, from my windows machine, I am able to connect and query it when I am logged on to the VPN Cisco Anyconnect is the client installed on the Windows box. p  pThe python script works correctly when run on a linux machine that is plugged into the internet at work. I havent tried it on my windows machine because, right now, I have no python on that machine, for one.p  pOn my linux machine at home, I have downloaded OpenConnect, which seems to be working fine for establishing a VPN connection. When I run my script from this machine, while on the VPN, I successfully connect to the database. If the test query I use in the script is to creat a table, or manipulate data in the database, it works. However, I am not able to RETRIEVE any data, i.e., if I run a select query, I get [].p  pAlso, it is perhaps worth mentioning, that the first thing I tried to do, before figuring out how to get a VPN client on my linux machine at first I was messing around with Cisco stuff which was a nightmare, was to ssh from my windows machine inside the private network to my home linux machine while forwarding a port from my home linux machine to 1433 on the SQL Server machine. Then instead of using pymsswl.connect to connect to the SQL SERVER machine, I connected to my local port. I observed the same behavior, actually, in this case as over the VPN. I wasnt particularly surprised that I couldnt get data back in that case, since its overwrought, and I could see SQL Server not knowing where to send the data....although I am really just speculating there anyway...p  pI should also mention that when I click around in the Cisco folder on my Windows machine, there is a security catalog with all kinds of wonkiness in it that I dont know much about. Maybe these certificatesthumbprints are at play. p  pSo, I admit total noobness here, and would appreciate any help. If I said something senseless, or if there is other information that might apply, Ill do my best to clarify.p

If I set it to codeandroidlaunchModesingleTopcode, when the user clicks the notification a few things can happen depending on Android Version or so my two devices showp  ol liIn Android lt 2.3, If Im in another activity say codeViewMessageActivitycode and I press the notification from the shade, nothing happens I dont receive anything from codeonNewIntentcodeli liIn Android 4.2 Not sure about other versions, If Im in another activity say codeViewMessageActivitycode and I press the notification from the shade, nothing happens I dont receive anything from codeonNewIntentcode emANDem the notification disappears from the shadeli liIf Im in codeNotificationActivitycode everything works great regardless of versionli ol  pSo this led me to set it to codesingleInstancecode instead of codesingleTopcode.  Now when the user presses the notification and the user is in a different activity say codeViewMessageActivitycode, the notifications intent is handled appropriately HOWEVER, my codeNotificationActivitycode tries to create a new instance of codeViewMessageActivitycode for the message clicked in the notification shade and it does not create a new activity.  Instead, shows my already opened instance.  Ive tried adding flags such as codeIntent.FLAGACTIVITYNEWTASKcode but neither my codeonCreatecode or codeonNewIntentcode methods are called in my codeViewMessageActivitycode.p  pIdeally, this is what I would like to happen  When the user has navigated to another activity say codeViewMessageActivitycode from the main activity codeNotificationActivitycode and the user presses a notification from the notification shade, I would like the NotificationActivity to be flagged to update its ListView view codeonNewIntentcode which will create another ViewMessageActivity instance.  Note I have no launchMode option set for any other activity.p  pAny suggestionsp  pVincep

Negative 379 pI have organized the templates in my Django project in such a way that each page on the site includes a common LESS file and each page can also specify another LESS file that includes pagespecific styles.p  pThe problem is that I need the pagespecific LESS file to be able to refer to variables in the common LESS file.

Negative 379 pI just started to code in node.js for a little while. Now here is one of my questions about itp  pIn HTTP apps, given the requestresponse model, the strongsinglestrong app strongthreadstrong is blocked until all the back end tasks are done and response is returned to the client, so the performance improvement seems to be limited only to finetuning back end things like parallelizing IO requests.   emWell, this improvement matters when it comes to many strongheavystrong and strongindependentstrong IO operations being involved, but usually the condition also implies that by redesigning the data structure you could eliminate a large number of IO request and, possibly, end up with even better performance than just issuing parallelized operations.em p  pIf that is true, how could it produce superior performance than those frameworks based on Java or PHP, python, etc. dop  pI also referred to an article a hrefhttpblog.mixu.net20110201understandingthenodejseventloop relnofollowUnderstanding the node.js event loopa, which also explains that situationp  blockquote   pIt really is a single thread running you cant do any parallel code   execution doing a sleep for example will block the server for one   secondp blockquote  precodewhilenew Date.getTime lt now  1000      do nothing  codepre  blockquote   phowever, everything runs in parallel except your code.p blockquote  pI personally verified that by putting exact the sleep code into one IO callback closure, and tried submitting a request leading to this callback, then submitted another one. Both requests will trigger a console log when it is processed. And my observation is that the later was blocked until the former returned a response.p  pSo, does it imply that only in strongsocketstrong mode, where both sides can emit events and push messages to each other at any time, would the full power of its asynchronous processing capability be utilizedp  pIm a little confused about that.

Negative 379 pSo, I have an app that I am experimenting with.p  pThe current state is good on my codedevelopcode branch. I want to install spree, but that comes with many migrations and changes to the db.p  pSo I made a new branch, just for Spree, based on my codedevelopcode branch.p  pI installed the gem, ran the migrations, and all that stuff.p  pHowever, I messed up a few stuff, so I wanted to revert to my codedevelopcode branch and deleted the codespreecode branch.p  pI assumed that my codeschema.rbcode would return to normal and so would my DB.p  pBut then I look in my codeSchema.rbcode and I see a lot of Spree tables.p  pNot only that, but I also see other tables in my codeSchema.rbcode that I know I had created a migration for and dropped in the codespreecode branch.p  pSo, for instance, I have an codeorderscode table in my codeSchema.rbcode that I know should have been dropped. A bit confused, I decide to create a new migration to drop the codeorderscode table along with the other tables that I dropped before installing spree and I get a PG error saying that the table doesnt exist.p  pSo....it seems that right now, my schema.rb and DB dont sync up. p  pAnd to make matters worse, my schema.rb and my codedbmigratecode folder doesnt sync up.p  pI was going to manually delete the codecreatetablecode statements in my schema.rb for the tables that shouldnt be there  but then its all a mess.p  pHow do I dig myself out of this hole and how do I prevent it in the futurep  h2strongIn Summarystrongh2  pstrongDBstrongp  pPreSpree Statep  ul liTable Ali liTable Bli liTable Cli ul  pSpree Statep  ul liTable A removedli liTable B removedli liTable Cli liSpreeTableAli liSpreeTableBli ul  pPostSpree Statep  ul liTable A removedli liTable B removedli liTable Cli liSpreeTableAli liSpreeTableBli ul  pemBasically identical to the strongSpree Stateemstrongp  pstrongDBMigrate Folderstrongp  pPreSpree Statep  ul liMigration for Table Ali liMigration for Table Bli liMigration for Table Cli ul  pSpree Statep  ul liMigration to Remove Table Ali liMigration to Remove Table Bli liMigration for Table Cli liMigration for SpreeTableAli liMigration for SpreeTableBli ul  pPostSpree Statep  ul liMigration for Table Ali liMigration for Table Bli liMigration for Table Cli ul  pemNote that the migrations for the PostSpree State dont sync up with the state of the DB of the PostSpree State.emp

The code looks something likep  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodepublic static void Initialize       Did you know the container can diagnose your configuration       Go to httpssimpleinjector.orgdiagnostics     var container  new Container      Container configuration code     DependencyResolver.SetResolver         new SimpleInjectorDependencyResolvercontainer  codepre  pThis configures the DI for the MVC controller correctly. p  pMy question is, if I want to get the instance of the container in any of the controllerclass to resolve some dependency manually how can I do it. p  pI have earlier worked on AutoFac and it has a dependency interface codeIComponentContextcode which can be injected into any class that needs to do any resolution manually.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pHere is a scenario. My controller uses a service who initialization depends upon the input parameter passed in the controller method and hence the dependency cannot be instantiated during construction time. p  pI understand that this is somewhat an anti pattern for DI, but it is requirement at few places and hence injecting the DI container is next best thing. Simple Injector samples should use of static variable to share the container which i want to avoid and also it is not possible by the way codeSimpleInjectorInitializercode works.p
Negative 379 pI added a UISwitch to a UITableViewCell in code, and added a targetaction.

In my subplots I am making four plots of the same data set, with each subplot having a different time range.  However, if I give each subplot the SAME time range then the minor ticks do not disappear.  This may be why Deditos could not reproduce my issue.  p  pThat being said, if I manually create each subplot with each having a different xaxis range, set the minor tick locations, THEN set each subplots xrange I do not see the minor ticks disappear until I set ax3s i.e. the last subplot range.  p  pIt seems the issue is in having different xaxis ranges.  Bizarre, I would think that by setting each axis properties individually they would not all be tied together.p  pemstrongEnd Editemstrongp  pI am creating one figure that has four subplots, all of which are time series. I have the xaxis major ticks spaced every four hours, and want minor ticks every hour. When I set the minor ticks for the first subplot called ax1 the minor ticks appear, as they should. However, when I set the minor ticks in ax2 they show up in ax2, but the minor ticks in ax1 disappear. This repeats for ax3, and ax4. So, in the end I have only minor xaxis ticks in the fourth subplot. I had the same problem with the yaxis, but resolved this issue using yaxis.setminorlocatorMultipleLocator5 for each axis see below.

Negative 379 pHaving recently started programming for android, i have run into a part of my code i wonder if can be designed in a better way. I have a codeSparseArraycode containing mapping of Ints representing resourceIds to an abstract class called codeResourcecode.

Negative 379 pOk So basically in my game, The world is made out of tiles and the tiles are split into chunks50x50 tiles and the tiles are 16x16 so the whole world isnt loaded in memory. The chunks are saved to files and only ones that are needed are loadedones on screen and 1 offscreen for each side of the screentop, left, bottom, right, and others are unloaded etc.. This all works fine however, When loading chunks that actually contain tiles the game logic freezes for quite a bityou know to load the file, Basically my question is how would I make my current methods faster, So theres little to no noticeable lagp  pBasically each chunk just contains a 2D array of bytes, Containing the tile type rather than the actual tile class, And That byte array is saved to a file to later be loaded.

Negative 379 pIm working on a CMS driven website using Angular 1.2 RC2 on the client side. As the content comes from a CMS Im unfortunately forced to use receive HTML in JSON Strings. Most of the HTML gets injected and rendered just fine, but image tags have their src stripped away. From what Ive read the src should have been prefixed with unsafe, not removed entirely if this was a XSS security issue in Angular .. but I might be mistaken.p  pIve been at this problem for a while now and feel Ive tried everything from plausible to downright stupid. Whitelisting my CMS url, whitelisting everything, disabling strongscestrong, forcing html trough strongsce.trustAsHtmlstrong and well ... So far, no luck. As the site is CMS driven Im unfortunatly not able to create a plunker  fiddle, but Im hoping a kind soul will try to help out anyway.p  pstrongUpdatestrong Forgot to mention that Ive also tried strongngsrcstrong, same effect.  strongUpdate IIstrong If I use a HTTPS the src attribute remains and the image is shown.

Negative 379 pI have a small header at the top of my page and then a table containing a decent amount of dynamic data.p  pThe data occasionally falls right on the edge of a page break when printing. So for example. p  ul liIf there are 19 or less rows in the table, it will all print on 1 page. li liIf there are 20 or 21 rows it will throw the entire table on the second page.li liIf there are 22 or more rows it the table, it will print 20 on the first page and 2 on the second pageli ul  pI dont mind the 1st or 3rd scenario, but I dont care for the second. I realize this is my OCD kicking in, but it seems like someone would know of a fix for it.p  pThis seems to only occur in Firefox. In Chrome the table will always split, around after 18 rows. IE10 seems to always split as well, also at 18 rows. p  pIve tried every conceivable variation of the followingp  precodetable  pagebreakinsideauto  tr     pagebreakinsideavoid pagebreakafterauto  codepre  pIm using bootstrap3, if that makes a difference.p  pstrongNotestrong You can have it all print on one page by changing the print zoom, but I cant expect my users to do that.p  pstrongNotestrong I do realize I could do a hack like check how many rows, and if it falls in the bad range, add or remove some padding somewhere on the page. But Id rather do it the correct way, assuming there is one.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong I Found out this happens only when Firefox is at the 100 zoom setting. When you set it to Shrink To Fit it behaves as the other browsers do. IE10, even with zoom set to 100 behaves normally.p

Negative 379 pIn this article a hrefhttpwww.michaelnoll.comblog20130621understandingstorminternalmessagebuffers relnofollowUnderstanding the Internal Message Buffers of Storma it is mentioned that storm does internal buffering. p  pNow, im going to have a huge number of events coming into my storm topology which will have multiple layers Bolts. The first layer will digest all incoming events in random manner and possibly for each incoming event will emit a new event to the next layer Bolt to Bolt.  However it is also possible for me that the first layer will only emit messages periodically and thus instead of emitting event for each incoming event it can emit a single one every tick lets say every second  this will reduce drastically the load on the next layer. p  pHowever as i was reading the above article, I saw that storm has internal buffering, I wanted to know if that means I dont need to mess with tick spouts because storm will already do the internal buffering for me.p

Negative 379 pI developed a clientserver mobile application using jQuery and PhP that performs mathematical tasks such as matrix multiplication. Both client and server codes are running on one mobile deviceemulator using web server such as Paw. When running the app on real device, the task takes about 5ms to transmit data from client page to the server using POST and get the response. It takes about 20 ms to perform the computation in server page. So, the total time is about 25 ms. p  pHowever, when running the same code on emulator the emulator is the same version of the real device, both are Android Nexus one, it takes 2030 ms to perform computation no wonder since emulator is slower, but transferring client data to server takes 20000 ms which is very strange. The data of request is something like 3000000 and the response is something like yes, so there is no voluminous data transmission.p  pThanks.p

and removing of fragments so Im sure there could be something there. p  pAnyway please help me decode this dump and figure out whats causing the crash I will try to ommit stuff I think isnt importantp

testing I started to get an error on the android emulator aswell. But on the android emulator it was a good old OutOfMemory exception. So it turns out that my drawable manager on one of the fragments had a huge memory leak where it would bloat a HashMap with drawables. It only became an issue when I implemented the two pane layout, since the DrawableManager would always stay in memory because the category selection fragment that holds the manager never gets recreated even when I switched categories.p  pstrongEDIT Even though Ive solved my memory leak, my genymotion emulator still crashes with the same SIGSEGV, So I guess this question is still open.strongp
Negative 379 pI have listview with checkbox which loads data from database. And i have a button too, when i press a button spinner is popping up with 2 messages EDIT and DELETE. Delete is working perfectly fine. and if i select Edit option and press OK then EditText is coming in alert window with two button Ok and Cancel.p  pNow i want that Whatever i enter in edittext and press Ok button a listview data which is selected Checked should update with new text whatever i have entered in edittext. So how to achieve this. Please help me. Any help would be appreciated.

Negative 379 pI am having some trouble with MS Access 2010. I am trying to modify a database I downloaded, a template from Microsofts web site, I am doing a little modifying to keep track of the food nutrition.  I have some experience with basic from the old days of the 16 bit Atari days. Im not totally green to VBA, just know enough to get in trouble.  I have a Form that uses a select query to populate lower half of the form.  I added an attachment field to the foods table which has over 8500 record that is the table for the query. My problem is to add VBA code in a module to see if there is a photo present or not. I want to be able to show an icon grayed out for no photo and a regular icon if there is a photo file. But thats for when I get it work to begin with. I call the function in the field propertiesp  precodePhoto1 chkAttachment[Photo] codepre  pThis one to start with gives me and error saying The multivalued field [Photo] is not a valid in  the expression chkAttachment[Photo]. When I change it top  precodePhoto1 ChkAttachment[Photo].[FileName] codepre  pI get and Error for the empty fields and a Has Photo for the one with a file in it. p  pThe Following code is the function I am referencing To Show what I am trying to dop  precodePublic Function chkAttachmentfldPhoto As String As String  On Error GoTo chkAttachmentErr  chkAttachment    Debug.Print fldPhoto If fldPhoto  Null Then     chkAttachment  No Photo Else     chkAttachment  Has Photo End If  chkAttachmentExit      Exit Function  chkAttachmentErr     MsgBox  It dont like Error number  amp Err.Number amp   amp Error     Resume chkAttachmentExit  End Function codepre  pThe query wont even call the code if the attachment is empty. I Googled the following question, and searched on this web site Microsoft Access 2010 VBA how to query attachment field without any luck. I have tried to use some code to count the number of files in the attachments, I found in the thread How to query number of attachments from Attachment field in Microsoft Access from Aug 2011, but couldnt figure out how to get it to work. When it comes to SQL, Im in the dark with that part.p  pThanks for any help that comes my way.p  pStevenp

Negative 379 pMy question concerns a class that I am writing that may or may not be fully initialized.  The basic goal is to take a codematchidcode and open the corresponding codematchurlcode example a hrefhttpdota2lounge.commatchm1899 relnofollowhttpdota2lounge.commatchm1899a and then grab some properties out of the webpage.  The problem is some codematchidscode will result in 404 pages a hrefhttpdota2lounge.com404 relnofollowhttpdota2lounge.com404a.p  pWhen this happens, there wont be a way to determine the winner of the match, so the rest of the codeMatchcode cant be initialized.  I have seen this causing problems with methods of the codeMatchcode, so I added the lines to initialize everything to codeNonecode if codeself.validurlcode is codeFalsecode.  This works in principal, but then Im adding a line each time a new attribute is added, and it seems prone to errors down the pipeline in methods, etc.  It also doesnt alert the user that this class wasnt properly initialized.  They would need to call code.isvalidmatchcode to determine that.p  ptldr strongWhat is the best way to handle classes that may be only partially initiatedstrong  Since this is a hobby project and Im looking to learn, Im open to pretty much any solutions trying new things, including other classes or whatever.

Negative 379 pIve given myself an exercise to understand how one could write a scalable API independently of an MV framework to be used in nonDOM environment. The desirable end result would be to have a class library or sorts, that is then in turn utilized by MV framework such as Knockout, which I use in the example below. p  pThe biggest challenge Ive found so far is to dealing with retaining twoway bindings. In order to do this, the underlying properties are required to be observable. p  precode no DOM in here, just the basics function QueryRequest    QueryRequest.prototype       get preference          return this.preference         ,     set preferenceval          this.preference  val       codepre  pHere is an example of what a function definition would look like from the library.      p  precodefunction QueryRequestViewModel      QueryRequest.callthis       DOM interaction safe in here...     this.preference  ko.observablePizza    inherit from QueryRequest, then point the constructor back to the view model, base we already call base. QueryRequestViewModel.prototype  new QueryRequest QueryRequestViewModel.prototype.constructor  QueryRequestViewModel  ko.applyBindingsnew QueryRequestViewModel  bind codepre  pHere is the view model, which is not independent but would inherit from QueryRequest. p  precodeltinput iduserdesire typetext namedesire maxlength500 databindvalue preference gt  codepre  pEverything almost works but theres a tad annoying issue. p  pWhen knockout goes to set the variable, it is not setting just the primitive, it wants to set its own object back. Obviously, this is not the desired outcome.p  pSuggestionsp  pMy only requirement is that knockout and any DOMrelated code can not be in the library.p  pIs there another way of achieving what I want Im open to the of another MV library which takes a different approach at observing attributes as well. p

So my code changed top  precode      put them in the combobox      for a as integer  0 to lastnames.count  1          if notgetinfo.CancellationPending then            lastnamebox.InvokeSub lastnamebox.Items.Addlastnamesa          end if      next codepre  pbut I still got the same error, so I added another check and changed the code to thisp  precode      put them in the combobox      for a as integer  0 to lastnames.count  1          if notgetinfo.CancellationPending then            if notlastnamebox.IsDisposed then              lastnamebox.InvokeSub lastnamebox.Items.Addlastnamesa            end if          end if      next codepre  pand I STILL get an error stating that the lastname box has been disposed, if I close the panel before the loop is finished.p  pThe error even states that the value of lastnamebox.IsDisposed is TRUE and the value of CancellationPending is TRUE. So why is it executing the next line if it is TRUEp  pHow can I stop this from happeningp

Negative 379 pHow do I place a quad on the near plane of the frustum at a particular point as defined by screen space  I have the frustum corners and Ive tried too many things to name them all but getting a quad at an exact point eludes me. especially if I moverotate the camera at all. Ive had some limited success in placing the center of the quads at a certain point but havent been able to offset them so the corners are where I want them to be.p  pIm using a perspective lefthanded projection. About the only thing I havent tried is going down the path of using a new Viewport with a fixed ortho camera and Im starting to think I might go that way...p  pOne of my closer failed attempts looks like thisp  precodeVector3 bottomleftcorner  Vector3.TransformCoordinateFrustum.Corners[1], viewProjection codepre  pWhere Frustum.Corners[1] is the Bottom Left Near corner.p  pUsing that vector would put a quad center in the corner of the screen but Ive been unsuccessful trying to offset it from center, which sounds a lot easier than Ive found it to be simply because I dont know what half is at that particular depth.  Also if I move the camera the quad starts moving around and I want it to be stationary. Im not sure if its fov thats throwing everything off or whatp  pTechnically I dont require screen coordinates, I would be happy with anything where I could determine the corners of viewport and place an object at certain point within it. I assume there is a simple way of doing this that I have not yet been able to figure out.p  pThanks.p  pOne thing I forgot to mention is that these quads are instanced, so the position vectors are simply added to an identity matrix in the vertex shader. I dont think that should make it any more complex but its probably worth mentioning.p

Negative 379 pIm having the following problem Id like to build a script which should work strongin every directory, regardless wheter rootdirectory or subdirectorystrong. So the most important thing is, that I have a .htaccessfile which will strongredirect all requests to the index.phpstrong in the directory where the script was installed. The redirect is simple, there are plenty of tutorials. But the problem is that I dont know the path in which the script was installed. I dont know if its a subdirectory or rootdirectory. The only solution I see is to make a install.php which will modify the htaccess with the correct paths. But are there better solutionsp  pstrongThank youstrongp  pUpdate Since there is apparently misunderstandings with my question, I will give you an example. Lets say my project contains only one index.php and a .htaccessfile. The .htaccessfile should redirect all requests to the index.php. That is very simple, strongBUTstrong the .htaccessfile does not know in which directory it will be called, so it could be the user installed the project in xyz but also in the root directory . If I request xyzabc123echoworld the .htaccessfile does not know in which of this directories the index.php is for the redirect, it only knows that it should redirect to the index.php of the root of the script. So my solution would be to make a install.php and change the .htaccessfile with the correct paths, but arent there better solutionsp

Negative 379 pI have an SBT project with its attendant build.scala file that relies on a JAR that is built by another separate Maven project. This JAR is expected to be in the lib directory as an unmanaged resource.p  pDo I want SBT to know where this JAR should be in the target directory of the Maven project and copy it over before buildingp  pOr do I want my Maven project to know where the JAR should be copied to the lib directory of the SBT project and copy it over on successful buildp  pOr do I want to tell the maven project to do something with the local repository and have the SBT project reference it as suchp  pMy guess is that the third option is what I want to do. If so, would someone be so kind as to ensure I understand the steps Specifically, Im unsure how to properly add the right incantations in my pom.xml to publish the JAR to the local repository and how to reference the local repository in the build.scala file.p  pI should note that using a remote repository is not an option, as this project must be able to be built on a local development box as well as by our Jenkins build server. If we push the JAR to a remote repository, everyone would be forced to use it, and development versions would collide with checkedin versions. So using the local repository or just copying the JAR into the lib directory is the way to go. That lets developers hack away until theyre happy, and when they check in, the Jenkins server picks up the checkin and does its own thing, independent of the state of everyones often messy dev environments.p  pI just need to figure out the proper way to automate this on builds so that developers dont have to copy the file every time they make a change.p

Negative 379 pI have recently read an enormous book on c, but I have not tested what I have learned until now. Now, this enormous book of mine was actually made in 1995, so I obviously cannot trust emeverythingem that this book states. In other words, I know not whether the compiler, enormous book, or I did something wrong.p  pIn order to test my knowledge of c, I made a class without pointer syntax due to fear of potential disaster that I called emMathContextem. As a quick summary, this class of mine has eight  constructors in order to be userfriendly if I can get this to work. It has three private fields or attributes I know not what one would prefer to call them in c called embaseem, emprecisionem, and emmodeem. The embaseem field of type short stores the requested base from two, inclusive, to thirtysix, inclusive, the emprecisionem field stores the requested decimal digit count according to the base Ill worry about that later, and the emmodeem field is actually an instance of a nested enumeration called emRoundingModeem.p  pAs you may see, this class is somewhat similar to the emjava.math.MathContextem class except that I include the emjava.math.RoundingModeem enumeration within the emjava.math.MathContextem class.p  pHere is the complete syntax of all files that I have

after I compiled those three files and began to debug them, the command prompt actually did not terminate I assume that some would call it a freeze, so I had to force its exit through the emWindows 8.1 Task Managerem. Now, thats what I call a problemp  pHere are two essential details My OS is Windows 8.1 I hope that it wont throw anyone off, and I use the emMicrosoft Visual Studio Express 2012 for Windows Desktop Update 4em. As miscellaneous information, I consider myself as an expert Java programmer it may or may not help perhaps someone could point out some relevant differences between Java and c so that this wont happen ever again, and the source code that I typed actually removed unnecessary whitespace for example, instead of embase  10em, I typed embase10em Well, the compiler apparently thinks that my code is fine, but it apparently is not for some reason. Could anyone point out to me what is obsolete that I use, why the debugging apparently freezes the command prompt, and any essential differences between Java and c that I should take note of as I program in c I sincerely thank youp

Negative 379 pIm trying to use WinAPI to bring any open window to the foreground. Ive tried many different ways of accomplishing this but none that worked out perfectly. Methods Ive tried include codeSwitchToThisWindowcode, codeBringWindowToTopcode, codeSetActiveWindowcode, and codeSetForegroundWindowcode using the codeAttachInputThreadcode and they all tended to fail if the target window was minimized. More recently Ive tried codeOpenIconcode and codeShowWindowcode with the RESTORE command to unminimize windows, but that too has presented a problem, in that, both of those methods unminimize the window to its Normal or Original state regardless of whether it was Normal or Maximized before it was minimized.p  pThe current solution I can think of is to intercept the minimize message to any open window and store its state before its minimized and restore it using that stored state. However, this would require me hooking into every process Id want to restore which Id really rather not do.p  pSo my question is, how do unminimize a window to the state it was in before it was minimizedp

Negative 379 pI have a DataGridView that has a DataGridViewCheckBoxColumn. Im trying to get the DataSource to update so that I can retrieve a DataTable of changes to save to the database. Ive read over several articles here and on other sites but I have had no success yet. I found that the CurrentCellDirtyStateChange event must execute after the CellContentClick event to avoid having to physically move off the DataGridViewCheckBoxColumn Cell to get the underlying datasource to get the changes. I am successful in retrieving .GetChanges if I move off the cell. The problem is that the CurrentCellDirtyStateChange never fires.

The app looks like this when you first start it I need 10 rep to post images so for now you get thisp  pre   List Of Lists                                                                                  Start Making Lists                                                                                                                                                             pre  pAfter you click Start Making Lists and enter a string into the popup that appears I get this issue where the 1st button gets removed but the screen is redrawn improperly.p  pre   List Of Lists                                            Test Label                                                                  pre  pIn case you cant tell from my ascii art there is a leftove portion from the original button that was there. You cant click it so it behaves like it is gone but my plus image and the shaded background still show.p  pThe Code, or at least what I think you need to seep  precodeOverride public void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      try         super.onCreatesavedInstanceState          init           Start DB Gather data          listData  new ListDBthis extends SQLiteOpenHelper         Cursor listNames  listData.getListNames0          if listNames.getCount gt 0                       Regular processing              createStandardViewlistNames                  else                       No lists yet, special view for new users              createNoListView                    Draw the view to the screen          setContentViewscreen     catchException e              TextView errMsg  new TextViewthis         String err  e.toString  n         StackTraceElement[] stack  e.getStackTrace          forint i  0 i lt stack.length i                      err  stack[i].toString  n                  errMsg.setTexterr.subSequence0, err.length         setContentViewerrMsg       codepre  pThe issue Kind of comes in in the call to createNoListView so here is that codep  precode  Creates the initial view the user will see when they first install the app  have no lists yet. This layout could  have been and should be in a seperate xml file like any other static android layout  public void createNoListView       Default Fresh Install add new list button view      final WideButton btnAddNew  new WideButtonthis, R.string.btnAddText, R.drawable.addnew     btnAddNew.setId1     btnAddNew.setImageDimensions35,35     btnAddNew.setOnClickListenernew View.OnClickListener         public void onClickView v             actionBar.addNewList                    llMain.addViewbtnAddNew  codepre  pThe WideButton class is a udf class I made. It extends LinearLayout and contains a textview and imageview. Ill be more than happy to post that class if anyone thinks it would help.p  pSo here is where the trouble actually happens. When the user clicks and we get into actionBar.addNewList. FYI ActionBar is a custom class I made in spite of the API providing a similiar feature. ActionBar is a private class to the class that is currently being executed. Action bar implements View.onCLickListener. Here is the addNewList function. Also llMain is a linearLayoutp  precode      Starts the process of creating a new list.           public void addNewList              LayoutInflater inflater  Activityactionbar.getContext.getLayoutInflater          final View vwDiag  inflater.inflateR.layout.addlistdiag, null         AlertDialog.Builder alert  new AlertDialog.BuilderListOfLists.this          alert.setViewvwDiag.setPositiveButtonR.string.ok, new DialogInterface.OnClickListener             Override             public void onClickDialogInterface d, int id                               Add the list to the DB                 EditText txtNameVal  EditText vwDiag.findViewByIdR.id.txtNameVal                 String listName  txtNameVal.getText.toString                  Display new item                 iflistData.getListCount  0                                      LinearLayoutListOfLists.this.llMain.findViewById1.removeAllViews                     ListOfLists.this.llMain.removeViewAt0                     ListOfLists.this.llMain.refreshDrawableState                     ListOfLists.this.llMain.removeAllViews                                   listData.createListlistName                 addListToViewlistName, null, null                      .setNegativeButtonR.string.cancel, new DialogInterface.OnClickListenerpublic void onClickDialogInterface d, int id         .create.show       codepre  pAs you can see Ive tried a number of different things. Other things I have tried were.p  precodefirst attempt if I remember correctly View btnAddNew  ListOfLists.this.llMain.findViewById1 ListOfLists.this.llMain.removeViewbtnAddNew  Another one Im sure Ive done View btnAddNew  ListOfLists.this.llMain.findViewById1 ListOfLists.this.llMain.removeViewbtnAddNew ListOfLists.this.llMain.invalidate codepre  pIve also done every combination of these commands I could think of that seemed at least somewhat logical. If you need to see more code just ask. I just thought it might be innapropriate to post my entire app so far on here.p

This worked. Then I tried loading the certificate from FileZilla into my Java and JBoss keystores.  This didnt. Then I tried creating a separate, simple JAR to test using FTPS.  This worked. Then I tried running that JAR on a different PC.  This worked but shouldnt have because it was lacking the certificate I tried paring down the code in my application so that it matched the JAR. This didnt work.p  pIve asked my solutions architect and web server admin for suggestions, but p  pAs for the second problem, when the disconnect method is called, I get this error java.lang.NoSuchMethodError org.apache.commons.net.ftp.FTPSClient.setSocketFactoryLjavaxnetSocketFactoryVp  pWhich makes no sense, AS FTPSClient is supposed to inherit that method from the socketClient class.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.p  pThanksp

Negative 379 pHow would I implement a breadth first traversal of a directorydepth unknown and not necessarily symmetrical. p  pMy first thought was using fork. I am not sure how to implement it. I was thinking a loop that would first get the parents, thens get the number of children of those parents, then forks so many times based on how many children and chdir to that child, which since multiprocesses were made all children are then chdird to. Then return the children as parents to be forked.p  pI feel like there are possible holes in this and I am looking for input on possible flaws or is this a terrible approach. I have heard about people using fork with breadth first, but never found any examples, so if you have any I would gladly look at them. p

Negative 379 pIm trying to put a piebased countdown timer view in a codeUINavigationBarcode.p  pThe codeUIViewcode subclass cleverly called codeProgressViewcode works fine when added to a standard codeUIViewcode.p  pWhen I try to use it as a custom view for a codeUIBarButtonItemcode in a codeUINavigationBarcodecodeUINavigationItemcode, however, things get a bit wonky.p  pThe reason is that, when the timer is finished counting down, the view turns into a green circle which shrinks down to a green dot to be less obtrusive.p  pIm initializing the custom codeUIBarButtonItemcode like thisp  precodeself.progressView                       [[ProgressView alloc] initWithFrameCGRectMake0, 0, 36, 36]      self.navigationItem.rightBarButtonItem  [[UIBarButtonItem alloc] initWithCustomViewself.progressView] codepre  pHeres the code that runs at the end of the timerp  precode[UIView animateWithDuration1.0f                       delay1.0f                     optionsUIViewAnimationOptionCurveEaseInOut                  animations                      self.transform  CGAffineTransformScaleself.transform, 0.25f, 0.25f                                    completionnil] codepre  pIt doesnt seem to matter whether I use thisp  precodeself.transform  CGAffineTransformScaleself.transform, 0.25f, 0.25f codepre  por thisp  precodeself.transform  CGAffineTransformMakeScale0.25f, 0.25f codepre  pWhen I monitor the codeframecode property of the custom view by overriding the codevoidsetFrameCGRectframecode accessor, I get the following output testing on iPhone 6 Plusp  precodeframe 0, 0, 0, 0 frame 0, 0, 36, 36 frame 358, 4, 36, 36  lt This displays 3 times for some reason frame 385, 17, 9, 9 codepre  pNow, its fairly apparent that the decrease by 27 points in the width of the frame is causing the codeUINavigationBarcodecodeUINavigationItemcode to shift the entire view to the right to maintain some buffer to the right edge of the screen. My calculations seem to indicate its maintaining a 20 point buffer. p  pHow can I animate the shrinking of my codeUIViewcode without altering the frame The drawing is so basic its just a green dot at this point, it can just appear to shrink, if theres some way to do that. p  pId be satisfied with some drawing trick that does it, but it seems that animating a transform is going to give the best appearance.p

Convert myfavedrink to an Array of single letters. Now loop through each letter stored in that Array and push it into the mynewdrink Array three times. Then convert mynewdrink into a String, and set myfavedrink equal to this new String. So if your favorite drink is Pepsi, at the end of the loop it should be PPPeeepppsssiii.p  pmy solution is the following, but in order to get cccoookkkeee, i need to type myfavdrink after the loop, which is not what is asked for in the problem.p  precodemyfavedrink  coke mynewdrink  [] myfavedrink  myfavedrink.split myfavedrink.each do drink   3.times do    mynewdrink.pushdrink   end   myfavedrink  mynewdrink.join end codepre  pWhere am i going wrong Thank you.p

However one of the operations done is binning data by standard deviations.p  pWithout going into the code itself, basically one takes an array L which contains frequency data from a histogram, then proceeds to reorder it from largest to smallest, takes the cumulative sum, normalizes divides by the total frequency, and then reverses the reordering process. The claim is that this reordered and normalized frequency data represents sigma standard deviation. How can this be truep  pTo illustrate assume L is frequency data [1,2,3,2,1] in 5 linearly spaced bins. Reordering it Lsorted  [3,2,2,1,1]. Cumulative sum  [3,5,7,8,9]. Normalizing against total frequency Lnorm  [0.33,0.55,0.77,0.88,1]. Finally reversing the reordering Lfinal  [1,0.77,0.33,0.55,0.88].p  pI am confused as to the meaning of this Lfinal, and how it can be related to sigma at all when plotted against the same bins.

Negative 379 pAs far as I can understand, linked list can only implemented with an outsider class. Because a class cant have a member varable of its own type and a node list need that type.

Negative 379 pI am fairly new to using pointers in C but I will try and explain what I want to do.p  pI have a class object Rx receiver, and in my program I will be using multiple receivers at the same time. Each receiver has a vector of data observations, for simplicity I am just using a vector of doubles. I also have an array of bools that determine which observations to use and I would like each receiver as a member variable have a pointer to this array. For example the first element in the array of bools will say true or false use the first observation you have receiver.p  pAlso, further in my code I would also like to point to an array of objects, would I follow the same procedurep  precodeint main       The elements in this array are set in the code before     bool useobservations[100]      I have chosen 3 for an example but in my actual code I have a vector      of receivers since the quantity varies     Rx receiver1, receiver2, receiver3      I would like to set the pointer in each receiver to point      to the array useobservations     receiver1.SetPointeruseobservations     receiver2.SetPointeruseobservations     receiver3.SetPointeruseobservations   end of main codepre  pMy receiver class declarations and definitionsp  precodeclass Rx public     Rx  Constructor     Rxconst Rxamp inRx  Copy constructor     Rx  Destructor     void SetPointerbool inArray  Function to set pointer to useobservation private     stdvectorltdoublegt data     bool pointertoarray[10]   end of class Rx  void RxSetPointerbool inArraypointertoarray inArray codepre  pThis is where I get the problems, either it doesnt assign correctly get lots of nulls or not assigned or I get an error on pointertoarray saying expression must be a modifiable valuep  pI havent bothered showing the constructor, copy constructor and Destructor.

PaulMcKenzie pointed out in his implementation in the comments in Rx that I should have bool pointertoarray not bool pointertoarray[6] and that solved the issue.

Negative 379 pIm trying to plan a SolrCloud implementation, and given current index sizes from testing, my estimated physical index size for 1 billion documents is roughly 20 terabytes. So far, Ive been unable to find a cloud host that can support a single volume of this size. I was hoping somebody could provide some guidance with regard to managing an index this large. Is a 20TB index absurd Is there something Im missing with regard to SolrCloud architecture Most of the guidelines Ive seen indicate that the entire index, regardless of shard count, should be replicated on every machine to guarantee redundancy, so every node would require a 20TB storage device. If theres anyone out there who can shed some light, I would greatly appreciate it.p

Any advice on what I may be doing wrong herep  pUPDATEp  pThanks, for your comments, peterchen and Jonathan Potter. I really appreciate your help with an issue. I am still having the same problem though.p  pWhat I have done so farp  ul liMade sure that WSCLIPSIBLINGS and WSCLIPCHILDREN style flags are set for the tab control and actual tab windowsli liMade sure that the window handle is valid for the element I am addressingli liMade sure that the window handle is not messed around with anywhere else in the code. Now for debugging purpose it is only mentioned in four places in the code. When it is initialized to NULL, when the window is created using CreateWindowEx and twice in the code segment where I am showinghiding it.li ul  pI sill get the same problem.p  pOne more observation I have madep  pMy application has a functionality to be minimized to tray and then restored. I do that by hiding the main application window. So here is what I have noticed if the element on the tab control is supposed to be hidden and it is not, and I minimize and then restore the application, after the entire window is redrawn, the element is hidden as expected. This is why I am 100 sure that I am calling codeShowWindowcode on the right element and that I dont show it somewhere else in the code. It has something to do with the elements not being repainted, but I cannot understand what exactly is the issue.p

Negative 379 pBelieve me, I have read all the other questions on this topic. None of them solved my problem or were even quite the same problem. Facebook login has been working perfectly fine for me for weeks... Until yesterday when suddenly it started breaking and giving me this error. p  pBefore yesterday, when I logged into my app with the Facebook SDK codelogInWithReadPermissionscode method, it would say Youve already authorized [app name] and be perfectly happy to log me in and move on. Then suddenly it started failing with this errorp  blockquote   pGiven URL is not allowed by the Application configuration One or more of the given URLs is not allowed by the Apps settings. To use this URL you must add a valid native platform in your Apps settings.p blockquote  pThe weird part is I hadnt changed any of the Facebook apps settings at all. This just suddenly started happening five minutes before it worked, next build it didnt. Nevertheless, I looked up the error message and found a ton of things people suggested to do on the facebook developer page to fix the problem... Mostly involving the codeValid OAuth redirect URIscode field, not that I could quite get a clear answer of what youre supposed to put in there for strongan iOS appstrong... They always said to put your website address. I dont have a website, I have an app... What givesp  pSo I knew I hadnt made any changes to the Facebook developer area to cause it to break, and Id tried every change there that I could find on the internet. So I pulled down an old working copy to test that, on the off chance that somehow code Id written was the problem. Nope code from a week ago, that worked perfectly fine, still gives me the same message.p  pIf the problem isnt in the code, and changing things on the FB site doesnt do it... Im out of ideas. If theres something else I need to do on the FB app to fix this, suggest away and Ill give it a try... And if it works thats great, but Im still not going to understand why it broke in the first place when I didnt make any changes... Anybody able to help me outp
