Positive 6691 pI am pretty familiar with unit testing and do understand the difference between mocks and stubs. The simplest explanation from Roy Osherove is that all fakes start out as stubs until you assert against them, then they are mocks.p  pAgain, I get all that. My question is Is it wrong to use a single fake instance as both a mock and a stub Take the following example from the Rhino Mocks documentation a hrefhttpayende.comwikiRhinoMocks3.5.ashx relnofollowhttpayende.comwikiRhinoMocks3.5.ashxap  precodepublic void Whenuserforgotpasswordshouldsaveuser    var mockUserRepository  MockRepository.GenerateMockltIUserRepositorygt   var stubbedSmsSender  MockRepository.GenerateStubltISmsSendergt    var theUser  new UserHashedPassword  this is not hashed password        mockUserRepository.Stubx gt x.GetUserByNameayende.ReturntheUser    mockUserRepository.Expect x gt x.SavetheUser     var controllerUnderTest  new LoginControllermockUserRepository, stubbedSmsSender    controllerUnderTest.ForgotMyPasswordayende    mockUserRepository.VerifyAllExpectations  codepre  pYoull notice that the mockUserRepository is named with the word mock and is calling the GenerateMock factory because further down in the code the mockUserRepository has a behavioral expectation established for it and eventually that expectation of behavior is being verified. Great, but along the way the mockUserRepository is calling its Stub method to can the data returned by calls to GetUserByName on the same object.p  pClearly, this example shows using an explicitly named and declared mock as both a mock and a stub.  Going back to Roy Osheroves definition that all fakes are stubs until you assert against them, I am forced to believe that using a fake as both a mock and a stub while certainly works is bad practice.p  pDoes anyone know if there is a verdict on doing thisp

That is why I started to look at using Mock.p  pI would like to setup a mock that Mocks an instance of this class to make it easy to run a unittest, but not mock the method codestartthingcode so that the real codestartthingcode implementation is tested, not a mocked version .. so I created thisp  precodeclass TestComplexClassTestCase      patch.objectmodule.ComplexClass, startthing      def teststartthingself, mockmethod         ComplexClass.startthing codepre  pWhen running my test the debug trace, assert or print are not hit in my real method codestartthingcode, which suggests I have mocked the class and the method  where I just want to mock the object and test the real methods. What am I doing wrong here Is that possiblep  pI have found lots of examples with Mock showing how to create a mock version of the method I want to test, which I think is kind of pointless since I dont want to check if its being called correctly, rather I want to test the implementation in the real code, and mock the class it belongs to so its easier to create.p  pPerhaps theres something I dont understand about the Mock testing idea as a wholep
Positive 6691 pI have the following setup Im mocking nonabstract class with PHPUnit, but not all of its methods. Therefore, nonmocked methods still exist as a call to real methods in the mock. p  pAnd the question is how to hint that those methods are available of course, with the proper signature p  pIll elaborate a bit. The sample of classp  precodeclass RealClass      public function callApiApi api       public function doStuffFoo foo, Bar bar   codepre  pNow I do in the testp  precode var  PHPUnitFrameworkMockObjectMockObject mock  mock  thisgtgetMockRealClass, [callApi] codepre  pThis will create mock for codecallApicode only, but then if in the test I dop  precodemockgtdoStufffoo, bar codepre  pMy PHPStorm can not find the method obviously and assumes this to be an error. How can I point that the codedoStuffcode method exists and requires proper argumentsp  pcodemethodcode seems to be working only within class definition. I tried to play a bit with codeseecode but was unable to resolve the matter. Also, the ideal solution would be the one that allows to specify hinting also within return statements as I may want to return mocks from test helpers methods.p  pCheap cheat is to hint with the original class, but that I do not want to do since then I will lose the point  which is mock and which is not. This especially is important since Im using helpers to build complex entities where mocks are injected.p

Positive 6691 pThis surely is a common problem. I have a properties file like codemysettings.propertiescode which is read by an application class. When I write a test class, it needs to test different scenarios of things that could be present in codemysettings.propertiescode in order to ensure maximum code coverage e.g. empty properties file, basic properties file etc. But I can only have one codemysettings.propertiescode in my codesrctestresourcescode.p  pWhat would be really great is if there was just some annotationp  pcodeMockFileOnClassPathuse  mysettingsbasic.properties, insteadOf  mysettings.propertiescodep  pThen I could just have multiple codemysettingsXXX.propertiescode files in my codesrctestresourcescode and just annotated the correct one on each test method. But I cant find anything like this. Im using JUnit 4.12.p  pI can think of a couple of crude solutionsp  ol liBefore each test, find the file on the file system, copy it using filesystem IO, then delete it again after the test. But this is clumsy and involves a lot of redundancy. Not to mention Im not even sure whether the classpath directory will be writable.li liUse a mocking framework to mock codegetResourcecode. No idea how I would even do that, especially as there are a million different ways to get the file codethis.getClass.getResourceAsStream...code, codeMyClass.class.getResourceAsStream...code, codeClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader.getResourceAsStream...code etc.li ol  pI just think this must be a common problem and maybe there is already a solution in JUnit, Mockito, PowerMock, EasyMock or something like thatp  pstrongEDITstrong Someone has specified that this question is a duplicate of a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions24231773specifyingacustomlog4jpropertiesfileforallofjunittestsrunfromeclipsSpecifying a custom log4j.properties file for all of JUnit tests run from Eclipsea but it isnt.

Positive 6691 pRecenty I was implementing a unit test using JOOQ MockDataProvider.  When I wanted to use my mock provider in DAO with many selects I had to use many ifelse statements. p  pAccording to a hrefhttpwww.jooq.orgdoclatestmanualtoolsjdbcmocking relnofollowhttpwww.jooq.orgdoclatestmanualtoolsjdbcmockinga, I just need to check if my SQL starts with some query. And my SQLs used in DAO could start with 3 different ways, so I used pretty complex ifelse construct. p  pSecond thing  I wanted my MockDataProvider to return some mock result only when SQL is executed for the first time, and then not to return any results  in DAO iterated in loop 5 times, and each time my DAO should check something in database. I had no idea how to mock such behaviour, so I used simple counter  but it looks awful, and I want it to be implemented in a good way.

Positive 6691 pFirst of all Feel free to tell me that this is an antipatternp  pIn my code, I have some functions responsible for calling external APIs. This is a prime candidate for mocking in the tests to make sure that the external API is not hit when tests are run.p  pThe thing is, the way mocking works in python at least the way I have been taught, we mock a position in the imported module structure explicitly, e.g.p  precodeimport mymodule  def testapi     mocker.patchmymodule.mysubmodule.jsonapis.myapiwrapperfunction     [...] codepre  pThis will mock out the codemyapiwrapperfunctioncode function for the test. However, what if refactoring moves the function or renames it, etc. If the test is not updated, it will most likely pass, AND the external API is hit, because the new location of the function has not been mocked.p  pI see two solutions to this question, but I am not sure how to implement any of themp  ul liMock stuff in a better way, so that I am sure not to have problems when refactoringli liCreate a decorator, which will wrap a function and raise an exception if the function is called in a test context I suppose this depends on the test runner that is used In my case, it is codepytestcodeli ul

Negative 6691 pHas anyone managed to do this  I tried making a managed wrapper class for IPropertyStore but am getting AccessViolationExceptions on the methods i.e. IPropertyStoreGetValue that take a pointer to PROPVARIANT rendered as a MarshalAsUnmanagedType.Struct out parameter in my managed version  Probably my understanding of COM and interop is inadequate  Im not sure if the problems are in my PROPVARIANT struct declaration which currently just uses StructLayout.Sequential, declares a sequence of bytes, and manually manipulates the bytes to get values of the various types in the union etc., COM issues with what process owns what, or something else. Ive tried various other versions of the PROPVARIANT such as using StructLayout.Explicit for the unions, nothings worked. Retrieving PROPERTYKEYs with IPropertyStoreGetAt  which is declared natively as taking a pointer to PROPERTYKEY and as having an out parameter of my own StructLayout.Sequential PROPERTYKEY in my wrapper  works just fine, by the way.p

For each table   created a fork is created for that specific table object that   allows each table to run independently.     Usernames details are also created and prepared.

Negative 6691 pI recently imported about 60k records into a table that relates data in one table to data in another table.  However, my client has since requested that a sort order be added to all 60k records.  My hope is there is a nice clean way to auto generate these sort orders in a SQL Update.  The finished data should look something like thisp  precodeitem1ID  item2ID  sortOrder 1           123       1 1           12        2 1           45        3 1           22        4 1           456       5 2           5         1 2           234       2 2           56        3 codepre  pCan this be done  Any suggestions would be hugely appreciated.p  pAnnep

After importing through VS2008, it initially runs correctly.

Negative 6691 pIm trying to inject some CSS that accompanies some other HTML into a C managed WebBrowser control. I am trying to do this via the underlying MSHTML DomDocument property control, as this code is serving as a prototype of sorts for a full IE8 BHO.p  pThe problem is, while I can inject HTML via mydomdocument.body.insertAdjacentHTML and Javascript via mydomdocument.parentWindow.execScript, it is flatout rejecting my CSS code. p  pIf I compare the string containing the HTML I want to insert with the destination page source after injection, the MSHTMLs source will literally contain everything emexceptem for the codeltstylegtcode element and its underlying source.p  pThe CSS passes W3C validation for CSS 2.1. It doesnt do anything too tricky, with the exception that some backgroundimage properties have the image directly embedded into the CSS e.g. codebackgroundimage urldataimagepngbase64code ..., and commenting out those lines doesnt change the result.p  pMore strangely and I am not sure if this is relevant, was that I was having no problems with this last week. I came back to it this week and, after switching around some of the code that handles the tobeinjected HTML before actual injection, it no longer worked. Naturally I thought that one of my changes might somehow be the problem, but after commenting all that logic out and feeding it a straight string the HTML is still appearing unformatted.p  pAt the moment Im injecting into the codeltbodygtcode tag, though Ive attempted to inject into codeltheadgtcode and thats met with similar results.p  pThanks in advance for your helpp  ptomp
Negative 6691 pIm relatively new to excel programming. Im working on making a spread sheet that shows exponential decay. I have one column A1A1000 of 1000 random numbers between 1 amp 10 using the TRUNCRAND10,0 in each cell. The next Column B1B1000 has a logic mask IFA10,1,0 , where if the value in the A cell is 0, then the B cell shows a 1. Next, to find the number of 0s in the A column, I have the next column taking the sum of B1B1000, which returns the number of 0s that showed up in the first column. Im sure theres an easier way to do that, but this seems to work fine. p  pHeres my problem, hopefully its clear what Im askingp  pNext, I want to take the sum of the logic column B from B1B1000 the value of the sum from B11000 in the cell below the cell that calculates sumB1B1000. Is there a way to to algebra in a cell formula to reference a cell More simply, if I want to refer to A3, for example, is there a way to input something like  A21 to get A3 Does this make sensep

Negative 6691 pWe are in the process of refactoring some code.  There is a feature that we have developed in one project that we would like to now use in other projects.  We are extracting the foundation of this feature and making it a fullfledged project which can then be imported by its current project and others.  This effort has been relatively straightforward  but we have one headache.  p  pWhen the framework in question was originally developed, we chose to keep a variety of constant values  defined as static fields in a single class.  Over time this list of static members grew.  The class is used in very many places in our code.  In our current refactoring, we will be elevating some of the members of this class to our new framework, but leaving others in place.   Our headache is in extracting the foundation members of this class to be used in our new project, and more specifically, how we should address those extracted members in our existing code.    p  pWe know that we can have our existing Constants class subclass this new projects Constants class and it would inherit all of the parents  static members.  This would allow us to effect the change without touching the code that uses these members to change the class name on the static reference.

Whats happening is the same control is being rendered twice in a row, making me click the button twice.  p  pI need another set of eyes to look at the code.p  precodepublic partial class CreateTriviaGame  BasePage          private TriviaGame game     private int step  1      protected void PagePreLoadobject sender, EventArgs e          LoadStepControl           private void LoadStepControl          BaseTriviaGameControl ctrl  null     switch step          case 1     ctrl  BaseTriviaGameControlLoadControlAddEditGame.ascx     break     case 2     ctrl  BaseTriviaGameControlLoadControlCrudQuestions.ascx     ctrl.TriviaGame  game     break     case 3     ctrl  BaseTriviaGameControlLoadControlAddEditPaymentInfo.ascx     ctrl.TriviaGame  game     break     case 4     ctrl  BaseTriviaGameControlLoadControlConfirmPayment.ascx     ctrl.TriviaGame  game     break     case 5     ctrl  BaseTriviaGameControlLoadControlThankForPayment.ascx     ctrl.TriviaGame  game     break           ctrl.EntitySaved  new EventHandlerctrlEntitySaved     holder1.Controls.Addctrl            protected void ctrlEntitySavedobject sender, EventArgs e          game  BaseTriviaGameControlsender.TriviaGame     step     holder1.Controls.Clear     LoadStepControl           protected override void LoadViewStateobject savedState          base.LoadViewStatesavedState     game  TriviaGameViewState[Game]     step  intViewState[Step]           protected override object SaveViewState          ViewState[Game]  game     ViewState[Step]  step     return base.SaveViewState              codepre  p EDIT   I should add that the reason that Im doing it like this is avoid having to declaratively add all of the controls to the page, then deal with each of them having loading before they need to be loaded.p

Negative 6691 pIm using the IE web developer toolbar to troubleshoot an issue.  A blank white space is appearing below a list item, and I cant logically figure out why.  Using the web dev toolbar, I see that in example 1 below, a Text  Empty Text Node is being output below  Text  Google.  Ironically, in the second, with a space manually inserted after the word Google, that text node no longer appears.  It would make complete sense to me if the results were reversed.

But I also need no empty space in between the items.  Im not quite sure why that empty space solves the problem, and would prefer not to just hack it.p  precodeltDOCTYPE html PUBLIC W3CDTD XHTML 1.0 TransitionalEN httpwww.w3.orgTRxhtml1DTDxhtml1transitional.dtdgt lthtmlgt ltheadgt ltstyle typetextcssgt a      displayblock  li      zoom 1  ltstylegt     ltheadgt ltbodygt     ltulgt         ltligt     ltdiv stylebackgroundcolorbluegt     lta hrefgtltimg  srchttpwww.google.comintlenALLimageslogo.gifgtltagt     ltdivgt             ltulgt                 ltli stylebackgroundcolorRedgtlta hrefgtOneltagtltligt                 ltli stylebackgroundcolorgreengtlta hrefgtTwo ltagtltligt                 ltli stylebackgroundcolorYellowgtlta hrefgtThreeltagtltligt             ltulgt         ltligt     ltulgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre
Negative 6691 pIve got some Django content that I plan to host on a vps, web facing. It dynamically generates images that are cached to disk regeneration is not often needed except 1user changes content within image or 2 the layout is updated globally so all images need regeneration right now when a user requests a view, it checks to see if whats stored on disk is the latest ie. the global layout has not changed and the user has not changed any content and either fetches the item from disk or generates a new image, stores it and serves it. p  pIve timed the process of generating and storing to disk and it takes around 200ms on a recent MBP running the Django dev server. While I dont expect a huge number of hits, Im still interested in peoples opinion regarding handling generating content like this, so I have a few questionsp  p1 What criteria should be used to decide if a processtask in general worth handing off to a queue system rabbitmq etc., obviously your not going to move every task off the app server so if its time taken, how many ms is it before its worth moving it offp  p2 I havent decided on what to host it with. If I plan to have a number of other dynamic content that may time some to execute involving images and the like, would I be better advised to host it with say nginx over lighttpd or apache using fastcgi, modwsgi etc Keep in mind I plan to host on a VPS with say 5121GB ram, and that it would be nice if the service degraded gracefully and if there was some way to prevent the process from locking up the server if there are many of requests for new images.p  pI do plan to run more tests as Im not well versed in this area but Id like to know from people with this experience what direction is it best to look in, no point trying things that are known not to work.p

Your client will still find 2 services, so when you attempt to use the service you cannot guarantee that it is the working one.p  pSo my question is, do you deal with this by looping through the endpoints and if the first one fails try the next one.

Negative 6691 pIm writing a shopping cart application for a family members online seed business.p  pIts a fairly straightforward workflow  users select what they want to order, type in their contact information, and the application generates an HTML EMail receipt and sends it to the contact address.p  pNow, heres the rub  Ive implemented the application in a MVC pattern. p  pIve got the AJAX frontend that only concerns itself with navigating through the workflow, and displaying formsthe currently placed orderetc. I generate all HTML displayed to the user through AJAX.p  pThe PHP backend simply generates the catalog, validates all user input, and does a bit of bookkeeping. My PHP scripts only return XML which gets parsed by my AJAX.p  pSince the HTML Email receipt I send to the customer looks very much like the application itself, it makes sense for me to reuse the same AJAX code that displays order information within the application.p  pHowever, since I cannot send an Email through AJAX alone, I have to make a call to a PHP script, pass in the string of HTML I want to send as an Email, have the PHP add proper headers to it, and send it on its way.p  pA nasty side effect of this is that I essentially have an exposed PHP script that will... Send an arbitrary string to an arbitrary EMail address.p  pHow should I go about securing this, while still keeping to the MVC pattern I want to keep the presentation out of my PHP, and avoid code duplication  as such, I dont want to have my PHP generate HTML that will go in the Email.p  pThank you in advance.p

Negative 6691 pIve got some strange errors happening in my rails app and Im trying to log better errors instead of the whole stack of passenger stuff that I dont care about. I thought I would do this with a Rescue clause and explicit error handling, like logging the params hash. But Im concerned if this would interrupt any rollback that is happening. For that matter, Im assuming rollbacks automatically occur when an error occurs as part of the normal rails error handling, but I havent been able to find that documented anywhere. Im using Dreamhost with MySQL, so I thought transactions and rollbacks were happening there.p

Negative 6691 pWere rewriting a calculation core from scratch in Delphi, and were looking for ways to let other people write code against it.p  pAutomation seems a fairly safe way to get this done.  One use were thinking of is making it available to VBAOffice, and also generating a .NET assembly based on the Automation object, thats easy.p  pBut the code should still be easy to use from Delphi, since well be writing our desktop UI with that.p  pNow Ive been looking into creating an Automation server in Delphi, and it looks like quite a hassle to have to design the components in the Type Library wizard, and then generate the base code.p  pThe calculations were having to implement are described in official rules and regulations that are still not ratified, and so could still change before were done  they very probably will, perhaps quite extensively.  Waiting for the final version is not an option.p  pAn alternative way could be to finish the entire object model first, and write a separate Automation server which only describes the toplevel object, switch codeMETHODINFO ONcode, and use TObjectDispatch to return all the subordinate objects.  strikeAs I see it, that would entail having to write wrappers to return the objects by IDispatch interface.  Since theres over a 100 different classes in there, that doesnt look like an attractive option.strike strongEditstrong TObjectDispatch is smart enough to wrap any objects returned by properties and methods as well so only the top objects would need to be wrapped.

Negative 6691 pPowershell tab expansion functions take 2 parameters, the line so far, and the current word.

Negative 6691 pIm having an awful time with my GridView.  Ive been going over my code with a finetooth comb and cant find the problem.p  pI have an ASP.net GridView with seven columns the data comes from SQL.  Two columns hold javascript that the user can click on to remove or modify an entry in the database.  The other five fields contain names, phone numbers, and email addresses of people in a database.p  pFour of my fields are ASP.net TemplateFields.p  pWhen the page loads, everything is displayed correctly.  However, if a user clicks a JavaScript link, clicks to sort the GridView by any field, or does any other action that causes a postback, the resulting page may not display the contents of my TemplateFields they are all blank.p  pJust so you can see what Im working with, I have a name column which is defined like thisp  precodeltaspTemplateField HeaderTextName SortExpressionname ItemStyleWidth150gt ltItemTemplategt ltstringEvalsurname  ,   stringEvalfname  gt ltItemTemplategt ltaspTemplateFieldgt codepre  pIf I step thru the code in the debugger, I see that in the case that the template fields display correctly, the debugger stops on the line that displays the name.  In the case that the fields are all blank, it jumps over the code to display the contents of those fields and for no discrenible reason whatsoever.p  pThe only thing that seems to cause the problem is that there is a single enum value that is set from the querystring which tells the page what data to load.  When the enum value is set to 1, I never see this error, but it seems that I always see it when the enum value is set to 2.p  pHowever, the enum is never ever referenced anywhere in my gridview code.p  pIn any event, the GridView.DataSource  x is always called and GridView.DataBind is always called.  Ive tried stepping thru the code and checking that the data from the database is correct.  Ive tried debugging on the code block where DataBind is called from and also the GridViewRowDataBound Event handler.p  pIve seen other posts elesewhere about trouble with TemplateField, but none of them seem to address whats going on here.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 6691 pSo, a little background. We are a small company with a halfdozen developers.

We found Redmine to be easier than track to administer and the ability to have subprojects and subtickets is great. p  pstrongHowever, the big problem we ran into is the fact that it is very difficult to manage schedules and  timelines. It seems like it would be incredibly timeintensive to manage because you have to manually enter a start date, estimated time, and end date for each ticket, project, etc.strong p  pSo if you setup a months schedule based on priorities, what are you supposed to do when a particular ticketissuesubproject takes up more time than was estimated. Right now, it appears I would have to go back in and strongMANUALLY change the startend date of every single item.strong p  pWhat would be ideal is to be able to set prioritiesdependencies and estimated time on ticketsmilestones, and have the software automatically manage the startend dates. Does anyone know how to get Redmine to do this, or recommend a different software package that can do something like thisp

I can create the object and move it around with the mouse by setting the flag ItemIsMovable. Now the halfcircle moves around freely but I want it to move just around the fixed central point. It is difficult to describe, but it should be something similar to a dial. How can I accomplish thisp

Negative 6691 pNumerous people have asked a similar question, but the responses were either just vague enough or not in the direction I needed things to go, so I will attempt to ask this as concretely as possible.  The context of this question is for iOS development using XCode 4.p  pI have an app where I use the same Widget numerous times.  In this simple exercise the widget will be a fixed sized red box with a label at the top that the root view controller will change, but you can imagine it has lots of ImageViews and ScrollViews and looks pretty spiffy.  This last point is key, because noncoding artistic designers want to be able to tweak this view globally without having to do the same thing over and over on each duplicated piece of the UI.  p  pIn the app I have replaced the ImageViews and ScrollViews that used to make up the widget with a single UIView, and using InterfaceBuilder set the Custom Class to codeWidgetcode.  I have outlets in the root view controller for these Widget objects properly hooked up.  The Widget Class is a subclass of UIView, and the code is as followsp  precodeinterface Widget  UIView      UILabel     label   property nonatomic, retain IBOutlet  UILabel label property nonatomic, copy NSString labelName end   implementation Widget synthesize label, labelName   idinitWithCoderNSCoder aDecoder      if self  [super initWithCoderaDecoder]            This is the code that I want to disappear             CGRect pos  CGRectMake5, 5, 90, 30         label  [[UILabel alloc] initWithFramepos]         [self addSubviewlabel]         self.backgroundColor  [UIColor redColor]          return self    NSString labelName      return label.text    This live updates the label in this custom view  voidsetLabelNameNSString name      label.text  name    voiddealloc      [super dealloc]  end codepre  pThe code works great, and I can live update the text in the custom views from the main view controller.  However, the four lines of code that are in initWithCoder are the problem.  Remember the designers  I have them at the point where they can work their magic with Interface Builder, but I cant for the life of me figure out how to get the UIView to load itself from a nib that they have designed.  To manually try and replicate the positioning and properties of ever single item is not terribly exciting and pretty timeconsuming and yes I realize I would be done by now if I hadnt written this posting.p  pSo very simply, how can I take an arbitrary .xib file and have it do the work I handrolled in initWithCoder  I am assuming it will be trivial at that point to hook up the IBOutlet for the UILabel, but please comment on this if Im overly optimistic.p  pAs a secondary question, once that is up and running on the real UI, I will have things like, UIScrollViews hooked up.  Does Widget become the UIScrollViewDelegate or where does this code get parked.  The root view controller should be oblivious to this, but it feels inappropriate to put code I traditionally put in a View Controller into a UIView object.p

After click set wallpaper you the stack trace below prints.

This is once they choose set wallpaper, Im not doing anything on the little wallpaper preview screen.p  pAny clue whats happening Not a single stack trace dips into my code.

Negative 6691 pI am working on implementing the preferences for our application. I know how to display preferences UI and how to readwrite values using codeSharedPreferencescode.

Negative 6691 pI am using jsonp and ajax to query a webservice written in java on another server.

Also if i take the jsonpcallback function out of the code, I get a complaint it firebug that the function is not implemented.p  pMy question three fold 1 What am i doing wrong on the jquery side 2 Why does the json get parsed correctly in jsonpcallback but not sitesreturn 3 What can i do to fix these issuesp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pSome new development.

Console.ReadKey        codepre  pThe purpose is absolutely useless, but I am asking myself when the two integer arrays will be disposed. The Test function should return another function, that is not evaluated until will be called. That is verified by using the debugger. So far, the first coll array should be disposed because it is replaced by the new set. However, the first function still evaluates correctly. At this point, either I must wait a longer time for the GC, or the array will be pinned somewhere...in the second hypothesis, Id expect the arrays would never released.

Negative 6691 pfrom measurements I get text files that basically contain a table of float numbers, with the dimensions 1000x1000. Those take up about 15MB of space which, considering that I get about 1000 result files in a series, is unacceptable to save. So I am trying to compress those by as much as possible without loss of data. My idea is to group the numbers into 1000 steps over the range I expect and save those. That would provide sufficient resolution. However I still have 1.000.000 points to consider and thus my resulting file is still about 4MB. I probably won t be able to compress that any further The bigger problem is the calculation time this takes. Right now I d guesstimate 1012 secs per file, so about 3 hrs for the 1000 files.

Negative 6691 pIm looking at Chris Coyiers tutorial for creating dynamic Next and Previous buttons for Jquery UI tabs. The buttons showhide themselves according to if they are pointing at the first or last tab. It works perfectly on his example, which is from 2009. Fastforward to 2011, the navs unfortunately does not work with new versions of jquery specifically, jquery1.6.4.p  pFor reference, the original tutorial a hrefhttpcsstricks.com2361jqueryuitabswithnextprevious relnofollowhttpcsstricks.com2361jqueryuitabswithnextpreviousap  pThe Coyier script correctly appends the Next  Previous buttons into the uitabspanel. However, the links either 1 do not click through to anything, 2 the first Next link goes right to the last tab, and the Previous link does not work, or 3 the Next  Previous links go only to the first and last tabs, skipping everything in between. p  pWhat I need is a way show and hide the next or previous buttons, depending on whether a viewer is looking at the first or last tab. p  pThe code I have so far is...p  precodej  jQuery.noConflict jfunction       var jQuerytabs  jtabs.tabs     j.eventsnavnext, .eventsnavprev.hide      j.uitabspanel.eachfunctioni          var totalSize  j.uitabspanel.size  1          if i  totalSize          next  i  2             j.eventsnavnext.show                  if i  0          prev  i             j.eventsnavprev.show                   j.eventsnavnext.clickfunction          var tabs  jtabs.tabs         var selected  tabs.tabsoption, selected         tabs.tabsselect, selected1         return false          j.eventsnavprev.clickfunction          var tabs  jtabs.tabs         var selected  tabs.tabsoption, selected         tabs.tabsselect, selected1         return false        codepre  pThe buttons work perfectly to navigate through my tabs. BUT, Im in desperate need to properly show and hide the first and last buttons. p  pIve tried using the jquerycustom script that Coyier used, which still did not work. Thus I assume its the modern version of Jquery thats causing the problems with the original tutorial. Im also a jquery newb. Any protips or pointers are most appreciated. Thank youp  pNotes These tabs are being used in a passwordprotected dev environment, so Im unable to provide the working example. In this instance the jQuery.noConflict mode is required and cant be removed.p

Its hard to see in that image, but basically theres an inner shadow and then a mild outer glow, and when you tap on them they have a fullon glow like regular bar buttons.p  pThey have sort of a stamped or embossed look, rather than the white mask of regular bar buttons.p  pAny ideas how to do that  Much appreciated, thanks.p

Negative 6691 pIs it possible If so, I would like to try this if only to learn more. Xcode seems to do so much automatically I would like to know what it really takes to make an iPhone app without all the setup being done for me in advance. p  pI realize this may be asking a lot, so if you feel like painting with broad stokes go ahead. I would like to just get an initial grasp of what would be needed to do this. p  pIdeally I would want to keep the option of running the app in the simulator or on my phone. How else would I be able to test and debug.p  pThanksp  hr  pstrongEDIT 1strongp  pFrom some of the responses weve got I see my intention needs to be clarified. The idea is to strongemlearnemstrong more about what Xcode provides in the process of developing iPhone apps. I dont want to necessarily circumvent Xcode, I just want to know what it actually does. p  pMaybe a list of some sort could be a place to start. Something like codeto avoid using Xcode you would need to figure out how to create targets, code sign, etc.codep  pI hope this helps. p

Negative 6691 pIn my datamodel a have many entities where attributes are mapped to enumerations like thisp    precodeEnumeratedEnumType.STRING private MySpecialEnum enumValue codepre  pMySpecialEnum defines some fixed values. The mapping works fine and if the database holds a NULLvalue for a column I get NULL in the enumValueattribute too. The problem is, that my backend module where I have no influence on uses spaces in CHARcolumns to identify that no value is set. So I get an IllegalArgumentException instead of a NULLvalue.p  pSo my question is Is there a JPAEvent where I can change the value read from the database before mapping to the enumattribute For the writeaccess there is the PrePersist where I can change Nullvalues to spaces. I know there is the PostLoadevent, but this is handled after mapping.p  pBtw I am using OpenJpa shipped within WebSphere Application Server.p

I am using 2 very basic processes applications, one is sending, the other one receiving.p  pI am willing to understand how linux internally works when using these function calls...p  pHere are my observations when sending packets atp  ul li10Kbps, the time it takes for the messages to go from one application to the other is about 28usli li400Kbps, the time it takes for the messages to go from one application to the other is about 25usli li4Mbps, the time it takes for the messages to go from one application to the other is about 20usli li40Mbps, the time it takes for the messages to go from one application to the other is about 18usli ul  pWhen using different CPUs, time is obviously different and consistent with those observations. There must be some sort of setting that enables some queue readings to be done faster depending on the traffic flow on a socket... how can that be controlledp  pWhen using a node as a forwarding node only, going in and out takes about 8us when using 400Kbps flow, i want to converge to this value as much as i can. 25us is not acceptable and deemed to slow it is obvious that this is way less than the delay between each packet anyway... but the point is to be able to eventually have a greater deal of packets to be processed, hence, this time needs to be shortened.

When no matching edge is found to walk down for C, a new leaf edge is created for C.li ul  pThe basic algorithm appears to be Onsup2sup, as is pointed out in most explanations, as we need to step through all of the prefixes, then we need to step through each of the suffixes for each prefix.

Negative 6691 pi have searched and tried a lot in this topic. What im trying to do is basically a vertical GalleryCoverFlow. I am aware that this should be done with a custom ListView. And i have done exactly that. p  pWhen doing this i appear to have 2 problems i just cant solvep  pi When scrolling in the List i want the items to move in slots. Most importantly the centered item should move exactly above a roundRect i drew. For better visualization Thats exactly what the CoverFlow does, but in a horizontal way. Trying to override onScrollStateChanged seem to work nondeterminstically. This is the way i tried thatp  precode       public void registerScrollListener        setOnScrollListenernew OnScrollListener           public void onScrollStateChangedAbsListView view, int scrollState          ifscrollState  OnScrollListener.SCROLLSTATEIDLE             int first  getFirstVisiblePosition             int last  getLastVisiblePosition              ListltViewgt childs  new ArrayListltViewgt              forint i  first i lt last i                 childs.addgetChildAti                          int centerHeight  getHeightCenterOfSideView             int centerPos  0             int distance  Integer.MAXVALUE             forView childView  childs                 int newDist  Math.abscenterHeight  childView.getTop  childView.getHeight2                 ifnewDist lt distance                     distance  newDist                     centerPos  childs.indexOfchildView                                           View childView  getChildAtcenterPos             smoothScrollToPositioncenterPos, centerHeight  childView.getTop  childView.getHeight2                            public void onScrollAbsListView view, int firstVisibleItem,                 int visibleItemCount, int totalItemCount               TODO Autogenerated method stub                    codepre  pii When scrolling in a noncircular ListView, i cant center the last or first item as the listview is empty when scrolling further. A possibility to do this is to add some extraitems at the end and the top. Problem is that i would like to use the listview separators and it looks ugly with empty views in it. The other thing is that i want do make this undependant of the display size, which should be difficult, seeing that the last item will not be centered exactly.p  pCould anyone help me with any of these two questions The easiest would be to just take some existing code.p  pThanksp

Negative 6691 pI am exploring the possibility of using Visual Studio isolated shell as UI scaffolding for my WPF application. The application will contain custom document windows as well as many side tool windows used to display extra information. I need the tool windows and document windows to either be controlled by a main controller or easily communicate with one another. p  pThere are VERY FEW documentations on VS isolated shell and even fewer examples. So I am hoping that someone with previous experience in developing custom apps or IDEs using VS isolated shell can help me with this. p  pIs it feasible to use VS isolated shell just for its UI scaffolding purposes If so, how can I essentially erase all of the inherited features from Visual Studio and custom everything from menu bars to document pages Or is it better to use some other UI scaffolding library, such as AvalonDocks The benefit of using VS shell is that its much more stable and I can easily port it into Visual Studio as a custom tool window if I need to.p  pMuch appreciatedp

Negative 6691 pIm attempting to work out simple controls for an application using pygame in Python. I have got the basics working, but Im hitting a weird wall I am using the arrow keys to control my character. If I hold down one arrow key, then hold down another arrow key to move diagonally, the character moves as expected. However, if I release the emsecondem key that I pressed while still holding down the emfirstem key, the character stops moving, even though I am still holding down that first key. Here is my simple movement codep  precodefor event in pygame.event.get     if event.type  QUIT         pygame.quit         sys.exit     elif event.type  KEYDOWN         if pygame.key.getpressed[KLEFT]             player.pos  player.pos[0]  2, player.pos[1]         if pygame.key.getpressed[KRIGHT]             player.pos  player.pos[0]  2, player.pos[1]         if pygame.key.getpressed[KUP]             player.pos  player.pos[0], player.pos[1]  2         if pygame.key.getpressed[KDOWN]             player.pos  player.pos[0], player.pos[1]  2 codepre  pNow, I was naturally very confused by this. So I tried to print some lines to debug. In the top of the main control loop, I wrotep  precodeprint pygame.key.getpressed[KDOWN], pygame.key.getpressed[KRIGHT] print pygame.event.get codepre  p...to output a tuple displaying the state of the down and right arrow keys, and then display the pygame event queue. My results baffled me even more. If I move the character diagonally down and right, pressing the down key first and then the right key, emthenem release the right key to make it move simply downward, the character stops moving as before... but this is printed to the shellp  precode1, 0 [] codepre  pThat is, when I emreleaseem the right arrow key and still hold down the down arrow key, pygame.key.getpressed understands that the down arrow key is still being held down, but there is nothing in the event queue.p  pAlso, earlier in the code before the control loop I am invoking p  precodepygame.key.setrepeat1, 2 codepre  pto make the character continue to move while the key is held down.p  pAny help will be appreciated Thanks     p

Negative 6691 pI have a CLI script that loads about 1GB of data from the database into memory that it will then use to READ ONLY from.

Negative 6691 pI am working my way thru a hrefhttpwww.cs.umd.eduprojectscyclonepaperscyclonesafety.pdf relnofollowCyclone A Safe Dialect of Ca for a PL class. The papers authors explain that theyve added a special fat pointer that stores bounds information to prevent buffer overflows. But they dont specify if the check on this pointer is static or dynamic. The example they give seems to imply that the programmer must remember to check the size of the array in order to check that they dont exceed the buffer. This seems to open up the possibility of programming errors, just like in C. I thought the whole idea of Cyclone was to make such errors impossible.

Set our buying price for a product 2. Add a minimum margin for each amounts of purchases 1100 and so on. This way no customer can get lower than we at least make a profit. 3. Then depending on what group the customer belongs to, add another margin on top of 1 amp 2. 4. Display The product on a webpage with the different prices when they add different amounts of items in the basket. p  pThat creates prices built on calculations instead of a fixed price list, but it should workp  pIs there anyone out there that has a working FOSS webshop in Python for this Any ideasp  pCheersp

Negative 6691 pIm developing an extension for Mercurial that can handle version numbers using Mercurial tags. Currently, it checks if the version number specified is in the right order with the others version numbers in the repository and if it is not too far from the previous one.p  pHowever, for now it only work if the repository has only one branch. Im trying to make it operational on repo with branches and more, on repo with divergent development line kind of unnamed branch. One of the tricky part is to define what the user can do and what it cannot. For examples, if on branch A there is the version 1.1 and 1.0.1 on branch B I think the Branch B should always stay below 1.1. As Im not familiar with lots of different way to manage version numbering in branch development, I want to gather use cases and how to handle it.p  pSo, I want to know if someone have already done research on the subject or knows good sources to help me solve this problem. You can also submit use case to handle.p  pObviously, I did some research but I cannot find anything really relevant. Probably because I dont know how to express the problem in a concise and search engine comprehensive way.p  pEdit Here is what rules I figured out for now  p  ul liOn each branch, the version number should be higher than the previous one but not too higherli liWhen you create a branch you can put any version number you want higher than the previous one.li liWhen the first version number is defined on each branch, that define the order for the entire branch. A branch can never overtake another one.li liThose rules are inherited by all further branches.li liWhen you merge two branches actually it is the annoying part, the common mercurial attitude is to consider the result of the merge as a part of the local branch. In my case it seems not to be the right behavior. Its would be very strange if when you merge the 1.0.3 branch with the 1.1.0 version from 1.0.3 that you only can use version below 1.1.0 because this branch is below the other one. The solution I suggest here is always treat the merge as the part of the highest branch otherwise some branch will regress.li ul  pCan you tell me if this is consistent or if I miss some important use cases.p  pstrongThe first part of the question is still on topic. If you know any relevant information on the subject or if you know a similar problem please tell me.after all, its only rules of numbering in a treestrongp

Negative 6691 pi am doing my project in iOS6. I have only one UIViewController for now.ON that i have a UIScrollView.

The width of simulator is 900 in portrait mode and in landscape mode its 1024.So my scrollview has its scroll at 900 width even in landscape mode. Its like stuck there even though i can move up and down easily. I am attaching a mockup . Scroll view is at the end of portrait900 and almost 23 at landscape900 again. The mockup is here  a hrefhttpdl.dropbox.comu40597849mockup3.png relnofollowhttpdl.dropbox.comu40597849mockup3.pnga. if you need more information please ask.Thanks..p  pEDIT Also on MainStoryboard for UIScrollView i have unchecked Use Autolayout checkbox. If i check it, i have the scrollview at the endas i want when i move from portrait to landscape.. but when i move again from landscape to portrait the screen freezes. I cant move up nor down.p
Negative 6691 pIm one of those socalled developers who got their way with Delphi without really understanding or even thinking about basics. In this case, Im talking about strongstringsstrong.p  pWhile I do understand how strongpreallocating memorystrong can result in a significant speed gain. I dont understand how to use it in simple, realworld, cases this is even more true with the TStringBuilder.p  pFor example, lets say I have this code that recursively search a folder amp add results to a hash listp  precodevar    FilesList  TDictionaryltString, Bytegt   Byte  file  0, folder  1     procedure AddFolderconst AFolderName  String var    FileName  String    AHandle   THandle    FindData  TWin32FindData begin      AHandle  FindFirstFilePCharAFolderName  , FindData      if AHandle  INVALIDHANDLEVALUE then         Exit       repeat            if FindData.dwFileAttributes And FILEATTRIBUTEDIRECTORY  0 then            begin                  Add a file.

In WPF I would just create custom component, which replease ListElement and just all But I dont know how do this in QML.p  pI anything not clear  please ask.p  pUPDATE Problem solved.

Negative 6691 pI have two Tornado processes codeXcode and codeYcode.

It is obvious that, in the handler of codeXcode, I need to publish a message to the channel which is subscribed by Y.p  pThis subscription in codeYcode should be longrunning, so that whenever a message is published to the channel, something in codeYcode should automatically update the variables in memory. However, it is not clear to me how to implement this subscription and the resulting updating in codeYcode, as it cant be a normal handler.

Negative 6691 pI have a website which relates to a database of products which I have created which is stored in phpmyadmin. I have separated access between users and admins.

To recap, I want to get timespan between each status 1 and 2. I pass the date in, and then I have to look up 2s as that ensures me that I will find 1s. If I went the other way around and looked for 1s, then 2s may not exist dont want that anyway.p  pAt the end I wanna be able to average stuff out... So lets say if some submission first went from 1 to 2 in a time span of 5h the code that I left, will get me up to this point, then lets say it got reassigned to 1 and then it went back to 2 in a new time span of 6h, I wanna be able to get both and do the average, so 562. p  pThanksp

Negative 6691 pI am in the planning phase of building a simulation and need ideas on how to represent data, based on memory and speed considerations.p  pAt each timestep, the simulation process creates 103 to 104 new data records, and looks at each new or existing records there are 106 to 108 of them then either deletes it or modifies it.p  pEach record has 310 simple fields, each either an integer or a string of several ASCII characters. In addition, each record has 15 other fields, each a variablelength list containing integers. A typical record weighs 100500 bytes.p  pThe modifyordelete process works like this For this record, compute a function whose arguments are the values of some of this records fields, and the values of these fields of another record. Depending on the results, the process prepares to delete or modify its fields in some way.p  pThen repeat for each other record. Then move to the next record and repeat. When all records have been processed, the simulation is ready to move to the next timestep.p  pJust before moving to the next timestep, apply all the deletions and modifications as prepared.p  pThe more records allowed, the better the simulation. If all records are in RAM, downside is simulation size and presumably upside is speed. The simulation doesnt need to be realtime, but obviously I dont want it too slow.p  pTo represent each record in memory, I know of these options a list or dict with some lists nested in it, or a class instance. To store away all the records and continue the simulation another day, the options in order of decreasing familiarity to me are a csv file where each line is a record, or just put all records in RAM then put them into a file perhaps using pickle, or use some sort of database.p  pIve learned Python basics plus some concepts like generators but havent learned database, havent tried pickling, and obviously need to learn more.

For each item run a new thread and process the item and then return truefalse it it was successfully processed. this will be used to readd it to the database queue or notp  pBut to only do this while the current number of active threads one per item being processed is less then a maximum number of threads parameter.p  pOnce the maximum number of threads has been reached I need to stop dequeuing items from the database until the current number of threads is less than the maximum number of threads. At which point it needs to continue dequeuing items.p  pIt feels like this should be something I can come up with but it is just not coming to me.p  pTo clarify I only need to implement the threading.

Negative 6691 pI am trying to build this device which takes analogue input from the earth , converts them into electrical impulses which I wish to input into a android smartphone for data analysis.

Negative 6691 pIve got a servo which turns opposite to the number I get from a program. The numbers I get from the program are between 37...113. I need to convert the 37 to its opposite side. So 37 becomes 113, 38 becomes 112, and so on. 75 stays at 75 because thats the mid point. p  pDo any of you know of a way to calculate this This sounds like simple math, but I cant figure it out. I dont want to use a lookup table because the range may change.p

The books are the root entities, and for performance, its not a good idea to use ancestors at this level.p  pSo, the idea is to read from datastore the less as possible, and have memcache syncronized.p  pNow my code, that doesnt workp  precodeclass Bookndb.Model      A Book      title  ndb.StringPropertyrequiredTrue     author  ndb.StringPropertyrequiredTrue      classmethod     def getAllcls         key  books         books  memcache.getkey         if books is None             books  listBook.query.orderBook.title.fetch100             if not memcache.setkey, books                 logging.errorMemcache set failed for key s., key         else             logging.infoMemcache hit for key s., key         return books      classmethod     def addMemcachecls, newdata         mylist  memcache.getbooks         if mylist             mylist.insert0, newdata             if not memcache.setbooks, mylist                 logging.errorMemcache set failed for key books.       This saves the data comming from the form     classmethod     def savecls, kwargs         book  Booktitlekwargs[title],                     authorkwargs[author]                          Save         book.put          Add to memcache for this key         logging.infoAdding to Memcache for key books.         cls.addMemcache[book.title, book.author]         return book codepre  pFor now Im simply inserting at start of the list. The problem with my code is that when I ADD to memcache, Im missing some kind of property because the jinja template says UndefinedError list object has no attribute title, when is trying to represent this linep  precodelttdgt line.title[40]escape lttdgt codepre  pWhich is obvious, because is a list, not an object with properties. But why it works when I convert the object in a list in the function getAll, making books  listthequeryp  pMy other problems will be how to modify an especific book in this case I can flush de memcache and read again, because there is not eventual consistency problem I think and how to delete how to identify a unique element in the list if 2 books have the same name.p  pAny suggestion Or must I change my solution to the problem of have memcache syncronizedp
Negative 6691 pSo we use log4j and want to update it at runtime.  We dont call springs log4j filter or log4js configure method.  We put the log4j.properties in the root of the classpath as many articles suggested and some kind of voodoo happens that makes it get loaded.p  pBut now, we want to add the watch thread to refresh log4j.properties at runtime.

Negative 6691 pI was looking for a way to have my codeDictionarycode enumerate its codeKeyValuePaircode in the same order that they were added.

Negative 6691 pWhile learning Linux kernel modules I can see so far from two sources two ways for writing Makefile. The first is something likep  precodeifneq KERNELRELEASE,         objm  module.o else default         MAKE C libmodulesshell uname rbuild Mshell pwd modules endif codepre  pThe latter is less complexp  precodeobjm  module.o all         MAKE C libmodulesshell uname rbuild Mshell pwd modules codepre  pEither makefile compilation leads to strongsuccessfully compiled modulestrong. My learning is accompanied with the LDD3 book and what I have read so far from it is the next onep  blockquote   pThis makefile is read twice on a typical build. When the makefile is invoked from the command line, it notices that the KERNELRELEASE variable has not been set. It locates the kernel source directory by taking advantage of the fact that the symbolic link build in the installed modules directory points back at the kernel build tree. If you are not actually running the kernel that you are building for, you can supply a KERNELDIR option on the   command line, set the KERNELDIR environment variable, or rewrite the line that sets   KERNELDIR in the makefile. Once the kernel source tree has been found, the makefile   invokes the default target, which runs a second make command parameterized in   the makefile as MAKEto invoke the kernel build system as described previously.   On the second reading, the makefile sets objm, and the kernel makefiles take care of   actually building the module.p blockquote  pIf the makefile is read twice then the second approach should lead to recursion, isnt itp

Negative 6691 pIm developing a codeBackbonecode application using codeMarionettecode and I need some help to organize the logic in the code.p  pCurrently I have a few views where I handle really similar logic, I want to abstract this to avoid repetitionp  pemView1emp  precodeonRender function      var pluginData  this.selector1.plugin     var pluginResult  this.handlePluginDatapluginData     this.doSomethingWithResult1pluginResult  codepre  pemView2emp  precodeonRender function      var pluginData  this.selector2.plugin     var pluginResult  this.handlePluginDatapluginData     this.doSomethingWithResult2pluginResult  codepre  pemEtcemp  pNote codehandlePluginDatacode do the same thing, codedoSomethingWithResultNcode its different but can be abstracted with a few params.p  pSo the questions arep  ul lipHow should I abstract this, I thought of extending from a codeBaseViewcode class and adding the logic there, but I dont know if theres a better way.pli lipIts okay to add a custom codeModelcode class which handles the calculation.

Negative 6691 pFirstly I am pretty certain it is not a problem with the options having paddingmarginborder as Ive specifically set them to have none.p  pTo see the problem please go here a hrefhttpantemortem.thecomicseries.comcomicslast relnofollowhttpantemortem.thecomicseries.comcomicslasta Scrolling down bellow the image is a HTML dropdown menu with Page 1 on it. Clicking on this there are a few other options, and to the right there is an extra maybe 15px of menu which I simply cannot understand. It cant be clicked on like the options, it isnt supposed to be there and it makes the options width greater than 180px which is what its set to be.p  pPLEASE NOTE, I HAVE TESTED TO SEE IF THIS GREY SPACE APPEARS ON CHROME AND OPERA, AND IT DOESNT. This leads me to believe it only appears only on Firefox...p  pTo see the code please just inspect the element as it will probably be easier for you to investigate, but if not I can past the HTMLCSS in.p  pSo basically I just want the extra grey space gone, so that the options are no wider than the dropdown menu button itself.p  pThanksp  pHTMLp  precodelthtml xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtml

Negative 6691 pI have developed a code that takes a set of 3D coords, and performs triangulation to generate the convex hullDelaunay .p  pThis has gone well and using the Deluanay triangulation I can test whether points are contained in a given volume using tsearchn. p  pNow I want to take two of such 3D volumes, and test whether they intersect. Futhermore I would like to know what the percentage of volume A is intersected by Volume B.p  pI think that I could generate a mesh grid of points that are within one of the volumes, then test them into the other using tsearchn.

Negative 6691 pThe problem is I have two points in 3D space where y is up, x is to the right, and z is towards you. I want to orientate a cylinder between them that is the length of of the distance between both points, so that both its center ends touch the two points. I got the cylinder to translate to the location at the center of the two points, and I need help coming up with a rotation matrix to apply to the cylinder, so that it is orientated the correct way.

Negative 6691 pI have a clientserver SSL socket implementation in Java, where a selfsigned certificate has been generated and imported into the client truststore. The server has a copy of the selfsigned certificate in its keystore.p  pThe cipher suite agreed is codeTLSECDHERSAWITHAES128CBCSHAcode, which is an epileptic Diffie Hellman Variant. The selfsigned certificate uses an RSA keypair, and the public key is listed on the certificate for encryption.p  pWhat Im not completely sure about is how the client validation process with selfsigned certificates works in Java. I understand how TLS typically verifies a certificate using the CAs public key on its signature, then comparing the decrypted hash against a generated thumbprint.p  pHow is the signature verified using selfsigned certificates Im debugging on the client side in Java using parameters codeDjava.protocol.handler.pkgscom.sun.net.ssl.internal.www.protocol Djavax.net.debugsslcode and I see no mention of a selfsigned public key for decrypting the signature, or a thumbprint hash. The certificate signatures and public RSA key are certainly mentioned though.p  pMany thanks.p

Negative 6691 pI have read many posts here and on other forums regarding the slow rendering D3DXFont in DirectX 9.0c, and I was working on improving text rendering. I did a simple test just to see how slow it really was, my test involved running a windowed test app  1280x720.p  pMy test did nothing more than clear the back buffer each frame and display the string This is a test string, in a 18pt Bold font with a shadow 1X1Y black string. What I saw with the frame rate kind of shocked me, with no text I maxed frame rate at about 1000fps. Then the frame rate seemed to drop about every 10 calls or so I am counting the shadow.p  pMy results are listed below, I am just curious if anyone knows why the frame rate drop has such a steep decline I am not necessarily asking how to make it faster I can figure that out but I am curious in what is going on behind the scenes that would cause this to occur.p  pThanks.p  pBTW, the following string counts are including the extra call to draw the shadowp  precode 10 strings   999fps   20 strings   500fps   30 strings   333fps   50 strings   280fps  100 strings   128fps  200 strings    85fps codepre

Negative 6691 pI have a problem with this macro that refuses to work at all. I am trying to have the macro sum up the number of classroom hours for Language courses, in order to have a check on long record files. TO give you a full explanation, on column 2 there is the name of the course e.g. Advanced English 2 and on column 3 one has the edition its a number. The file is previously sorted by column 2, then 3. If the course name and edition is the same it means that I need hours to be added to the total.  The Teacher if refers to the fact that in that column there is either Teacher or Assistant, but the latter dont need their hours counted so I want to skip the rows where there is one. The cells in column 5 and 6 are times e.g. 1300, 0845. I want the code to write in column 12 the number of hours no matter the format, I know that excel reads dates and times as numbers so I can be happy with just a number in that cell.

Negative 6691 pIm using HttpClient to asynchronously make many requests to an external api. I wait for all the requests to complete, then use the responses in other code. My problem is that if I make too many requests, my code throws an exception when I use the Task.WhenAll to wait.p  pThis code will ultimately be run in parallel, by which I mean that Ill be doing many sets of these async requests at the same time i.e. 10 sets of 200 async requests.

Negative 6691 pIm looking for solutions to a fun new wrinkle in Windows support for the PostgreSQL project.p  pWhen plugin DLLs are loaded into the main executable with a codeLoadLibrarycode call they expect the dynamic linker to resolve references to functions emand global variablesem exposed by codepostgres.execode. p  pIts easy to forget to put a codedeclspecdllimportcode annotation, or rather, the codePGDLLIMPORTcode macro that expands to it, on an codeexterncode thats accessed via a DLL, since almost all PostgreSQL development and testing happens on Linux and OS X, where none of this stuff applies.p  pThe project relies on automated testing to detect when a codedeclspecdllimportcode is missing on a function, as this causes linker errors. Until yesterday the assumption was that the same was true for global variables, but it isnt it turns out that dynamic linkage emsucceeds silently, producing a garbage resultem.p  pSo  Im looking for advice on how to emdetectem and empreventem such illegal accesses, where a global is not codedeclspecdllimportcodeed.p  pThis is complicated by the fact that on Windows, PostgreSQLs build system generates code.defcode files that just export everything. Not my doing, but I cant change it, yes, I know. This means that even if theres no codePGDLLIMPORTcode marking the site codedeclspecdllexportcode during building of the main executable, the symbol is still exported.p  pIdeas Is there any way to get the linker to throw a runtime error when an codeexterncode global is defined in another module and the codeexterncode isnt properly codedeclspecdllimportcode annotatedp  pIf the project stopped generating .def files and instead used codePGDLLIMPORTcode annotations that expand to codedeclspecdllexportcode when compiling the .exe, and codedeclspecdllimportcode when compiling plugins that use the exes API, would that produce linker errors when a symbol isnt annotated properly Is there any alternative to thatp  pIm currently looking for more info and Im going to be writing a few test programs to try to test ideas, but Im far from an expert on Windows development and Im looking for an authoritative the right way to do it if possible.p

Negative 6691 pas the title indicates, I want to have different error views for each module in my Zend Framework1Projekt.

Negative 6691 pJBoss EAP 6br Hibernate 4p  pI have a J2EE application with a web browser client.  Apache click   Both the internal business logic and the client use the same entity objects. p  pI would like to have all relations in the entities set to lazy loading. This way I have good performance. p  pBut when using the entities in the client  that is the server side code of apache click  I would need a lot of the relations to be eager loaded. The client code is accessing the backend through a session bean. p  pSo I have a couple of ways I can solve this p  ol lipCreate 2 of each JPA entities, one with eager loading and one with lazy loading. And then use the one with eager loading in the client, and the one with lazy loading in the server. Most of the server logic will be in a transaction, so lazy loading is fine here. pli lipMake all relations lazy loading. When accessing the entities from the client, make sure there is a transaction.  TransactionAttributeTransactionAttributeType.REQUIRED  and code the access to the necessary fields so they are accessible after session bean call.  But that means that I have to start a transaction when that is not required, i.e. if I am only getting some objects. And I have to maintain more code. And I have to know exactly what relations the client needs. pli lipCreate an inheritance hierarchy, where I have a super entity, and then 2 child, one with objects relations lazy loaded, and one with only values, no objects. i.e.  pli ol  pSuper p  precode    MappedSuperclass     public class SuperOrder       Id     Columnname  id     GeneratedValue.....     private Long id      Columnname  invoice, length  100     private String invoice codepre  pChild 1p  precode    Entity     Inheritancestrategy  InheritanceType.SINGLETABLE     Tablename  testorder     SequenceGenerator....     public class Order extends SuperOrder       ManyToOnetargetEntity  PrintCustomerEnt.class, fetch  FetchType.EAGER, optional  true     JoinColumnname  printcustomerid, nullable  true     ForeignKeyname  fkprintcustomer     Valid     private PrintCustomerEnt printCustomer      public PrintCustomerEnt getPrintCustomer          return printCustomer           public void setPrintCustomerfinal PrintCustomerEnt printCustomer          this.printCustomer  printCustomer            codepre  pChild 2p  precode    Entity     Inheritancestrategy  InheritanceType.SINGLETABLE     Tablename  testorder     SequenceGenerator...     public class LazyOrder extends SuperOrder       Transient     private String printCustomerName      Columnname  printcustomerid, nullable  true     private Long printCustomerId codepre  pWhat is the best practice... or is there something other good way to do this. p  pBasically the problem is I want to use the same entities in different scenarios. Sometimes I need eager loading, and sometimes I need lazy loading. p

Negative 6691 pIm studying computer engineering, and I have some electronics courses. I heard, from two of my professors of these courses that it is possible to avoid using the codefreecode function after codemalloccode, codecalloccode, etc. because the memory spaces allocated likely wont be used again to allocate other memory. That is, for example, if you allocate 4 bytes and then release them you will have 4 bytes of space that likely wont be allocated again you will have a emholeem.p  pI think thats crazy you cant have a emnottoyprogramem where you allocate memory on the heap without releasing it. But I dont have the knowledge to explain exactly why its so important that for each codemalloccode there must be a codefreecode.p  pSo are there ever circumstances in which it might be appropriate to use a codemalloccode without using codefreecode And if not, how can I explain this to my professorsp

Negative 6691 pAs in many Java apps, were using Freemarker in our app to render emails. Weve found that some of our templates werent rendering exactly as we thought they would, and so we realized that we ought to write some unit tests for our template rendering. Well I set up the tests, and immediately received a FileNotFoundException emTemplate mytemplate.ftl not found.emp  pI figured that this must be both a solved problem with an easy solution. That was many work hours ago, and I realized that I was wrong from what I can tell, this is neither solved nor easyp  pOur apps setup is, I think, pretty standard. We have a Maven project, and store our Freemarker templates in srcmainwebappWEBINFfreemarker. Although most of our apps functionality is initiated by Quartz jobs, we deploy it as a webapp. Therefore the following configuration in our spring XML file is all that we needp  precodeltbean idfreemarkerConfiguration     classorg.springframework.ui.freemarker.FreeMarkerConfigurationFactoryBeangt     ltproperty nametemplateLoaderPath valueWEBINFfreemarker gt ltbeangt codepre  pThen in our code, we Autowire the bean in like sop  precodeAutowired protected Configuration freemarkerConfiguration codepre  pand use it like sop  precodeTemplate template  freemarkerConfiguration.getTemplatemailjobdetail.ftl codepre  pThat works great in the context of our deployed app, executing within a Quartz job. But we always get the template not found when running from within unit tests.p  pI tried many different approaches, none of which worked. The last involved creating my own Freemarker TemplateLoader implementation, and trying to get it to load the Freemarker template files form the classpath. The problems with that approach are that a the same classloading code that I successfully use elsewhere in tests would not find the template, b Im not sure all that is involved with correctly implementing a TemplateLoader, and c this all just seems overlycomplicated in general.p  pI may continue this route, but first... am I missing something obvious One of Freemarkers benefits is that it doesnt require an HTTP context, so why would it be so difficult to use Freemarker outside of a web app contextp

Negative 6691 pIm working on an Android NDK app, which uses a number of static libraries.

So far I have worked around this issue by adding the dependency include directories manually to the LOCALCINCLUDES variable, but it feels kind of messy to run up and down the relative paths to the other modules.p  pIt seems like there must be a better way to do this.  I know that the LOCALEXPORTCINCLUDES does work when referencing a static library from my primary shared library  the one loaded by the NativeActivity , but it just doesnt seem to work from static library to static library.p  pAm I just setting this up wrong somehow  Should these modules be able to import each other and get the includes automaticallyp

Negative 6691 pI am trying to combine tables from grid.table together with plots from base package into a single plot.

Negative 6691 pWhen building maven  based jobs in Jenkins, Jenkins wants to copy the pom into the Jenkins workspace .. sometimes  which is resulting in a file not found exception trace attached and a failure of the job though maven build succeeds.  Analog job configuration wont trigger this copy and ends with successful. Any idea Both in Jenkins 1.5.62 as well as 1.5.40, Maven 3.1.1p  pAdditional Information The builds are not triggered via svn or any other revision control system. I figured out that the directory substructur in workspace does not exist, but after creating it the file didnt get copied. still the only solution I found yet is to copy the pom.xml manually at the expected location. Maven does not fail, of course, because the path to the original pom.xml is at the expected location. So I guess I was wrong about expecting Jenkins to do the file copy. The funny part Not every job with exactly this setup pom not in the workspace  does fail.p  pStacktrace p  precodeArchiving homeworkspacescppNXPUtilitiestargetUtilities1.0SNAPSHOT.jar to com.nxp.native.utilitiesUtilities1.020140508.15502445Utilities1.020140508.15502445.nar homeworkspaces4NXPUtilitiespom.xml is not inside varlibjenkinsjobsNXP C Development Linux 64bit UtilitiesworkspacehomeworkspacescppNXPUtilities will archive in a separate pass homeworkspaces4NXPUtilitiestargetUtilities1.0SNAPSHOT.jar is not inside varlibjenkinsjobsNXP C Development Linux 64bit UtilitiesworkspacehomeworkspacescppNXPUtilities will archive in a separate pass channel stopped  ERROR Failed to parse POMs java.io.FileNotFoundException varlibjenkinsjobsNXP C Development Linux 64bit UtilitiesworkspacehomeworkspacescppNXPUtilitiespom.xml No such file or directory     at java.io.FileInputStream.openNative Method     at java.io.FileInputStream.ltinitgtFileInputStream.java146     at hudson.FilePath.readFilePath.java1637     at jenkins.plugins.maveninfo.extractor.properties.PomPropertiesFinder.findPropertiesPomPropertiesFinder.java50     at jenkins.plugins.maveninfo.extractor.MavenInfoExtractor.extractMavenInfoExtractor.java58     at jenkins.plugins.maveninfo.extractor.MavenInfoEnvironment.tearDownMavenInfoEnvironment.java42     at hudson.maven.MavenModuleSetBuildMavenModuleSetBuildExecution.doRunMavenModuleSetBuild.java862     at hudson.model.AbstractBuildAbstractBuildExecution.runAbstractBuild.java518     at hudson.model.Run.executeRun.java1704     at hudson.maven.MavenModuleSetBuild.runMavenModuleSetBuild.java519     at hudson.model.ResourceController.executeResourceController.java88     at hudson.model.Executor.runExecutor.java231 codepre

Negative 6691 pI created a logging library codeliblog.socode. I want to share a variable called codeFile rtfilecode its defined in codelibrt.hcode and also this header inherited by codelogrt.c,loglinux.c gt liblog.socode,codelogd.c gt logdcode and also codelogrtclient.c gt logrtclientcode. Here i created a daemon codelogdcode which putsactually should codefile pointercode codertfilecode. p  pThats what i want to do.  Here codeliblog.socode is a dynamic libarary, codelogdcode starts on boot up and it should set file pointer to codertfilecode and codelogrtclientcode should get the file pointer and print some logs.p  pProblem comes to share the common variable codertfilecode.  I tried other suggestions suggested in p  pstackoverflow a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1433204howdoishareavariablebetweensourcefilesincwithexternbuthow[1]a first solution was to use codeexterncode and complete the task. For my situation i though for a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10355339howtoshareavariableanditsvaluebetweenmanysourcefileinclanguage[2]a this. Rather than making a global variable put the variable to scoped file and use codegetcode and codesetcode functions to access the values. p  pbut both options didnt worked for me let me Explain. p  ol liI Have tocompiled all the files codeliblog.socode codelogdcode and codelogrtclientcode separately so, it was showing error when codelogrtclientcode had declaration of codertfilecode but not defined because its defined in codelogdcode. which was notcant compiled with codelogrtclientcode. Though all the files linked to codeliblog.socodeli liWhen i tried second options, results were unexpected, codelogdcode calls to codeliblog.socode sets and gets the file pointer but when i ran codelogrtclientcode codertfilecode doesnt had the expected pointerFile pointer. Means allocation for codertfilecode for both are differen. li ol  pCan any one suggest me a solution. Hope this explains everything. p

Negative 6691 pMy company runs an ecommerce website, built on top of backbone.js framework. Although Im not a web programmer, I understood that each module in the website category pages, product pages are rendered using the relevant viewtemplate pair. We would like to offer to publisher sites to host our product pages as widgets. I understand that this requires some js code on our side that the hosting site should download in order to display the widget. Is it possible to extract the relevant viewtemplate pieces from the website code base and make it standalone in  that js code I guess it requires injecting the relevant css and js libs to the calling page, are there some frameworks to ease that processp  pThanksp

Negative 6691 pIn ObjectiveC I often move common init code into its own method, and then I call that method from the various designated initialisers of the class. Like thisp  precode voidcommonInit      gradientLayer  [CAGradientLayer layer]     gradientLayer.frame  self.bounds      ...     idinitWithCoderNSCoder aDecoder      self  [super initWithCoderaDecoder]     [self commonInit]     return self    idinitWithFrameCGRectframe      self  [super initWithFrameframe]     [self commonInit]     return self  codepre  pIn Swift this pattern does not work because you basically have to use a two stage init. First you have to assign variables of your own subclass, then call codesuper.initcode and only then you are allowed to access self. e.g.p  precodeinitcoder aDecoder NSCoder        initial assignment must be done first     gradientLayer  CAGradientLayer      no calls to self allowed     super.initcoder aDecoder      calls to self allowed     gradientLayer.frame  self.bounds      ...   codepre  pI can easily move the second phase, the set up, which happens after codesuper.initcode to its own method.

I have this error  p  precode0609 205745.851  1016110161 EAndroidRuntime FATAL EXCEPTION main     java.lang.IllegalStateException Could not find a method onBuyPressedView in the activity class android.view.ContextThemeWrapper for onClick handler on view class android.widget.Button with id buyItBtn             at android.view.View1.onClickView.java3724             at android.view.View.performClickView.java4274             at android.view.ViewPerformClick.runView.java17357             at android.os.Handler.handleCallbackHandler.java615             at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessageHandler.java92             at android.os.Looper.loopLooper.java137             at android.app.ActivityThread.mainActivityThread.java4949             at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeNativeNative Method             at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeMethod.java511             at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInitMethodAndArgsCaller.runZygoteInit.java1043             at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit.mainZygoteInit.java810             at dalvik.system.NativeStart.mainNative Method      Caused by java.lang.NoSuchMethodException onBuyPressed [class android.view.View]             at java.lang.Class.getConstructorOrMethodClass.java460             at java.lang.Class.getMethodClass.java915             at android.view.View1.onClickView.java3717 at android.view.View.performClickView.java4274 at android.view.ViewPerformClick.runView.java17357 at android.os.Handler.handleCallbackHandler.java615 at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessageHandler.java92 at android.os.Looper.loopLooper.java137 at android.app.ActivityThread.mainActivityThread.java4949 at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeNativeNative Method at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeMethod.java511 at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInitMethodAndArgsCaller.runZygoteInit.java1043 at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit.mainZygoteInit.java810 at dalvik.system.NativeStart.mainNative Method codepre  pYou can see my activity here  p  precodepackage net.sparkeek.test.cubydroid.app  import android.app.Activity import android.content.Intent import android.net.Uri import android.support.v7.app.ActionBarActivity import android.os.Bundle import android.util.Log import android.view.View import android.widget.Toast  import com.paypal.android.sdk.payments.PayPalAuthorization import com.paypal.android.sdk.payments.PayPalConfiguration import com.paypal.android.sdk.payments.PayPalFuturePaymentActivity import com.paypal.android.sdk.payments.PayPalItem import com.paypal.android.sdk.payments.PayPalPayment import com.paypal.android.sdk.payments.PayPalPaymentDetails import com.paypal.android.sdk.payments.PayPalService import com.paypal.android.sdk.payments.PaymentActivity import com.paypal.android.sdk.payments.PaymentConfirmation  import org.json.JSONException  import java.math.BigDecimal   public class PaypalActivity extends ActionBarActivity       private static final String TAG  paymentExample             Set to PaymentActivity.ENVIRONMENTPRODUCTION to move real money.

Negative 6691 pI have a system which sends messages to millions of user.p  pWe have 6 application nodes in a cluster with one common oracle data baseRAC.p  pIn one of the usecase, we have to send message to user and once it is delivered, we have to update a counter in db table which has the detail of no. of messages sent to an user. We also have a constraint that we have to send only n number of messages to an user in a day.p  pcodeSo, 1 Every time before sending the message, we have to read the database to fetch the counter value. 2 Every time after sending the message,we have to update the counter.codep  pAny node can receive the message for any user and it can read and update the DB in parallel.p  pNow, the issue we are facing is each node couldnt handle more than 1K messages per second. During peak load, all threads are either reading or updating DB.p  pWe are thinking of introduction of a cache mechanism to avoid DB calls. But, since here write to DB is also huge, we feel cache may not be the correction solution.p  pDo you have any better suggestion or architecture to handle this usecase with both heavy read and write operation on DB  What solution you would suggest if you face this situation  p  pPlease let me me know if you need more info.p
Negative 6691 pSo I am importing a giant list of part numbers from an Excel file converted from a CSV report from somewhere else with VBA.

Negative 6691 pI am having a hard time understanding what should be a simple concept. I have constructed a vector in MATLAB that is real and symmetric. When I take the FFT in MATLAB, the result has a significant imaginary component, even though the symmetry rules of the Fourier transform say that the FT of a real symmetric function should also be real and symmetric. My example codep  precodeN  1  28 k  linspace1,1,N  V  expabsk  Vf1  fftfftshiftV Vf2  fftifftshiftV Vf3  ifftfftshiftV Vf4  ifftifftshiftV Vf5  fftV Vf6  ifftV  disp[isrealVf1 isrealVf2 isrealVf3 isrealVf4 isrealVf5 isrealVf6] codepre  pResultp  precode0 0 0 0 0 0 codepre  pNo combinations of codeifftcode or codeifftshiftcode result in a real symmetric vector. Ive tried with both even and odd N codeN  28code vs. codeN  128code.p  pI did try looking at codekflipkcode and there are some residuals on the order of codeeps1code, but the residuals are also symmetric and the imaginary part of the FFT is not coming out as fuzz on the order of codeeps1code, but rather with magnitude comparable to the real part.p  pWhat blindingly obvious thing am I missingp  pstrongBlindingly obvious thing I was missingstrongp  pThe FFT is not an integral over emall spaceem, so it assumes a periodic signal. Above, I am duplicating the last point in the period when I choose an even codeNcode, and so there is no way to shift it around to put the zero frequency at the beginning without fractional indexing, which does not exist.p  pA word about my choice of codekcode. It is not arbitrary. The actual problem I am trying to solve is to generate a model FTIR interferogram which I will then FFT to get a spectrum. codekcode is the distance that the interferometer travels which gets transformed to frequency in wavenumbers. In the real problem there will be various scaling factors so that the generating function V will yield physically meaningful numbers.p

Negative 6691 pIn my program, I have sprites fall from the top of the screen and the user taps each sprite to keep them from falling to the ground, which results in game over. These sprites are in the shape of stars.p  pbMy question is, how can I keep track of how many times each star has been tapped, so when a user taps the star 3 times, it disappearsb p  pI currently have 2 different types of stars fall from the sky, and whenever they are added to the game, they are added into an array.

Negative 6691 pPython has a confusing history of tools that can be used to package and describe projects These include emdistutilsem in the Standard Library, emdistributeem, emdistutils2em, and emsetuptoolsem and maybe more. It appears that emdistributeem and emdistutils2em were discontinued in favor of emsetuptoolsem, which leaves two competing standards.p  pTo my understanding emsetuptoolsem offers far more options e.g. declaring dependencies, tests, etc. than emdistutilsem, however it is not included in the python standard library yet.p  pThe emPython Packaging User Guideem[a hrefhttppythonpackaginguserguide.readthedocs.orgenlatestcurrent.html1a] recommends nowp  blockquote   pUse setuptools to define projects and create Source Distributions.p blockquote  pAnd explainsp  blockquote   pAlthough you can use pure distutils for many projects, it does not support defining dependencies      on other projects and is missing several convenience utilities for automatically populating package  metadata correctly that are provided by setuptools. Being outside the standard library, setuptools  also offers a more consistent feature set across different versions of Python, and unlike  distutils, setuptools will be updated to produce the upcoming Metadata 2.0 standard formats on all supported versions.p      pEven for projects that do choose to use distutils, when pip installs such projects directly from source rather than installing from a prebuilt wheel file, it will actually build your project using setuptools instead.p blockquote  pHowever, looking into various projects emsetup.pyem files reveals that this does not seem to be an actual standard. Many packages still use emdistutilsem and those that support emsetuptoolsem often mix emsetuptoolsem with emdistutilsem e.g. by doing a fallback importp  precodetry     from setuptools import setup except ImportError     from distutils.core import setup codepre  pFollowed by an attempt to find a way to write a setup that can be installed by both emsetuptoolsem and emdistutilsem. This often includes various ways of error prone dependency checking, since emdistutilsem does not support dependencies in the setup function.p  pWhy are people still making the extra effort to support emdistutilsem  is the fact that emsetuptoolsem is not in the standard library the only reason What are the advantages of emdistutilsem and are there any drawbacks of writing emsetup.pyem files that only support emsetuptoolsem. p

The problem occurs when I try to link directly to the signup form and not the calender activity page.p  pBasically, the signup form does not understand which calendar activity you want to sign up on, unless your previous page was that specific activity page. It seems like theres some sort of meta data that doesnt get registered if link directly to the sign up form.p  pSo I need to create a URL that links to the signup form, as if I was standing on its calendar activity page.p  pIs this even possiblep

Negative 6691 pIve used Visual Basic for almost 20 years, I think, starting with VB6. Ive been using VS 2010 since, well, 2010, and have never had this problem before The navigation bar in the Basic editor has disappeared.p  pEvery solution I have found online says to go to OptionsText EditorAll Languages and enable navigation bar. As the attached screen caps will show, this is confirmed, but its still not showing.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com921jk.jpg altVB Optionsimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.combhZOR.jpg altenter image description herep  pIt only does this for this one asp.net project I am working on.

Also, on the .ASPX editor on this project the navigation bar is visible.p  pI closed all projects, all programs and even restarted the computer, no luck.p  pSo I guess its a twopart question what do I do to restore the navigation bar And if I cant restore it, is there an alternative to creating methods for object eventsp  pThanksp

Negative 6691 pIm working on a package for octave and something odd is happening.  In the foo function for class A I make a recursive call using cellfun like thisp  precode... cellfund food,localval, cellarray  ... codepre  pNow function foo is defined for several different classes. Ive previously used this practive successfully.  The difference this time is that, in class B, foo makes use of two subfunctions and functions private to class B.  This causes the above call to result in the following errorp  precodeerror subfunction2 undefined near line 29 column 6 error called from error   usrshareoctavepackagesmypkgBfoo.m at line 1, column 1 codepre  pIve tried changing the order in which subfunctions are listed in the function file for Bfoo and have verified that it finds the first subfunction but not the second. I also tried making the subfunctions private to class B and the problem persisted.  p  pSo my question is this Whats happening here  Is it the use of cellfun The anonymous function Why does it catch one subfunction to foo but not two Objects classes Whats up with the linecolumn 1 being reported Id really like to hide these helper functions from the user, so Id prefer something other than dropping the subfunctions in the public path.   p

Negative 6691 pLet me try and describe the requirement.p  pMy product has many sites, each sites have many warehouses, and each warehouse has a count of a important resource it is responsible for.p  pWhenever someone wants that resource, I want to efficiently pick a site, warehouse which will fulfill the requirement based on some heuristics.p  pI reckon I need a transaction over such a operation as I do not want to leave things in a messy state.p  pI have gone over the documentation many times and understand that entity groups are the recommended way of doing transactions. p  pFrom Google AppEngine Go documentationp  blockquote   pAn entitys parent, parents parent, and so on recursively, are its ancestors its children, childrens children, and so on, are its descendants. An entity and its descendants are said to belong to the same entity group.p blockquote  pIf I make it so that each warehouse has a site as an ancestor, I can get good control when operating on warehouses under the same site i.e. entity group.p  pWhat is the simple approach of making the operation safe across all sites and their warehousesp  pApproaches I have thought ofp  ul liMake all sites under a virtual parent, but does that allow me to operate on W1 a warehouse under site S1 and W2 a warehouse under site S2 transactionally In other words, are W1 and W2 in one entity group because their own ancestors have the same parentli liMake all warehouses under a virtual parent, and take the compromise as then all the warehouses are in the same entity group.li ul  pIs it just me or the meaning of entity group slightly up for interpretation as per the docsp  pPS The number of such safe operations required is relatively low, so I am not too worried about the limited write throughput of having things under one entity group.p

Negative 6691 pSince Version 8 Java has the concept of a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase8docsapijavalangdocfilesValueBased.htmlemvaluebasedem classesa. This is in preparation of a future version which will most likely allow the definition of a hrefhttpcr.openjdk.java.netjrosevaluesvalues0.htmlvalue typesa. Both definitionsdescriptions mention serialization bold face added by mep  pAbout the existing valuebased classesp  blockquote   pA program may produce unpredictable results if it attempts to distinguish two references to equal values of a valuebased class, whether directly via reference equality or indirectly via an appeal to synchronization, identity hashing, strongserializationstrong, or any other identitysensitive mechanism.p blockquote  pAbout future value typesp  blockquote   pThe default identitybased hash code for object, available via System.identityHashCode, also does not apply to value types. Internal operations like strongserializationstrong which make identitybased distinctions of objects would either not apply to values as they do not apply to primitives or else they would use the valuebased distinction supplied by the value types hashCode method.p blockquote  pBecause future JVM implementations might not use object headers and reference pointers for valuebased classes, some of the limitations are clear. E.g. not locking on an identity which the JVM must not uphold. A reference on which is locked could be removed and replaced by another later, which makes releasing the lock pointless and will cause deadlocks.p  pBut I dont get how serialization plays into this. Why is it considered an emidentitysensitive mechanismem Why does it emmake identitybased distinctions of objectsemp

Negative 6691 pI have an application which uses a database MongoDB to store information. In the past I have used a class full of static methods to save and retrieve data but I have since realised this is not very objectorientedish or future proof.p  pEven though it is very unlikely I will change database I would rather something that does not tie me too strongly to Mongo. I would also like to be able to cache results with the option to refresh the cached object from the database but this is not essential and can be done in another place.p  pI have looked at data access objects but they do not seem very welldefined and I cant find any good examples of implementation In Java or a similar language. I also have many one off cases such as finding usernames for tab completion which seem not well suited and would make the DAO large and bloated.p  pAre there any design patterns that would facilitate getting and saving objects without being too database specific Good examples of implementation would be helpful preferably in Java.p

Negative 6691 pI have a delegate that I created in a Navigation Controller that has a table view.

Which means it isnt calling back to the MainViewController class to execute the code. Im still a little week on delegation. I know how it works, but when it doesnt I usually get a little lost.

That all works fine and good because I am using NSUserDefaults to pass data toward the modal view. All I am trying to do now is select data, dismiss the view, and set the data to the main view.p

Negative 6691 pBasically I am trying to use Excel and VBA to query new values to a worksheet, run some checks and calculations on the query data and archive the rows that meet a certain criteria.  I have the current worksheet cross referenced to an archive worksheet and any rows that are not already in the archived worksheet are copied to it.  I was using two for loops to iterate through IDs in each worksheet but as I have learned like everybody before me that once the row numbers become significant the macro becomes unwieldingly slow.

Negative 6691 pI get my eBay transactions either with a codeGetOrderscode or with the codeGetItemTransactionscode API call. Both calls have codeFeeOrCreditAmountcode in it which should contain the Paypal fees.  p  pcodeGetItemTransactionscode usually returns just 0.00 . codeGetOrderscode returns the Paypal fees  but nearly only for USD transactions.

Negative 6691 pI have a celery task that performs an operation on an objects attributes and saves it. Lets say were computing a persons bmi. We take a persons height and weight and calculate the bmi, then save it on codeperson.bmicode. In Railss DelayedJob you would just make an instance methodp  precodeClass Person      def computebmi         self.bmi  self.weight  self.height  703         self.save  person.delay.computebmi codepre  pBut in python the celery tasks normally seem to be separated out in tasks.py without access to the instance, Class, or database session. Is it bad practice to write celery tasks that do it the above way  p  pMy issue is I might have to do this on a few million records, so sending the task a json payload of the user data and returning the bmi is mostly pointless, as the load from the db readwrite is one of the biggest parts of the job. p  pIt also seems like doing it this way wouldnt be possible with services like ironmqs ironworker, the only way I can think of to put this in the cloud is to spin up an ec2vps instance. p

Negative 6691 pUsing AudioTrack for playback, I sometimes need to resample audio that do not conform to the sample rates supported by AudioTrack. In doing so, I need to determine the maximum sample rate supported by AudioTrack, under the current device, under the current audio configuration.p  pDue to the allowable sample rates for AudioTrack being poorly documented, I decided to snoop around the source code for codeAudioTrackcode and found this staggering linep  precodeprivate static final int SAMPLERATEHZMAX  96000 codepre  pit would seem that the codeAudioTrackcode instance is applying a hard limit of 96 KHz regardless of the actual playback capabilities of the device.p  pMore confusing is in the codeAudioFormatcode class, in which I pass to the constructor API 21 of codeAudioTrackcode, which contains this linep  precodeif sampleRate lt 0  sampleRate gt 192000  codepre  pin its codesetSampleRatecode method. Now thats a hard limit of strong192 KHzstrong. So, passing  192 KHz into AudioFormat or its builder will result in codeIllegalArgumentExceptioncode from codeAudioFormatcode and passing a configured 192 KHz lt x lt 96 KHz sample rate AudioFormat into AudioTrack will also throw an codeIllegalArgumentExceptioncode.p  hr  pWhat I found, by far, most confusing is the method codegetNativeOutputSampleRatecode in AudioTrack which strongactually does return the correct output sampling ratestrong well, not much surprise given its ran directly from the native layer, but so inconsistent.p  pAnd just to top it off, the method codesetPlaybackRatecode which claimsp  blockquote   pThe valid sample rate range is from 1 Hz to twice the value returned by getNativeOutputSampleRateint.p blockquote  pAnd indeed, I did try it, and it works Consider the following snippetp  precodeint nativeRate  AudioTrack.getNativeOutputSampleRateAudioManager.STREAMMUSIC  android.util.Log.iUI, Native stream rate   nativeRate   Hz   Build audio attributes  AudioAttributes.Builder attribBuilder  new AudioAttributes.Builder  attribBuilder.setContentTypeAudioAttributes.CONTENTTYPEMUSIC attribBuilder.setUsageAudioAttributes.USAGEMEDIA  AudioAttributes attrib  attribBuilder.build   Build audio format  AudioFormat.Builder afBuilder  new AudioFormat.Builder  afBuilder.setChannelMaskAudioFormat.CHANNELOUTSTEREO afBuilder.setEncodingAudioFormat.ENCODINGPCM16BIT afBuilder.setSampleRatenativeRate  try     AudioTrack trackTest  new AudioTrackattrib, afBuilder.build, nativeRate, AudioTrack.MODESTREAM, 0      android.util.Log.iUI, Track created successfully direct catchException ex     android.util.Log.wUI, Failed to create AudioTrack at native rate       Use a random supported samplerate to get pass constructor     afBuilder.setSampleRate48000      try         AudioTrack trackTest  new AudioTrackattrib, afBuilder.build, nativeRate, AudioTrack.MODESTREAM, 0          trackTest.setPlaybackRatenativeRate          android.util.Log.iUI, Track created successfully indirect     catchException e         android.util.Log.wUI, Failed to create AudioTrack at 48 KHz       codepre  pfollowing the program flow, when the native sampling rate is stronglt 96 KHzstrong, the code prints outp  blockquote   pNative stream rate 48000 Hzbr    Track created successfully directp blockquote  pbut, when I hook up an external DAC with playback capabilities up to strong192 KHzstrong, I getp  blockquote   pNative stream rate 192000 Hzbr    Failed to create AudioTrack at native ratebr    Track created successfully indirectp blockquote  pWhat is with these inconsistencies And is, codesetPlaybackRatecode identical to the sample rate passed into the constructorp

I can see on the Reference that they have a AxACCTRLLib.AxAcCtrl.dll. I downloaded autodesk design review 2013. My question is the .dll library for the embedded view has a diferent name. Because I cannot find any with the same name of library as show above.

Negative 6691 pI currently am developing a semisimple chat app. I want the user to be able to communicate with one other person in a private chat. Just plain text will be sent. Currently my system calls php scripts from a webpage, passes in parameters and then parses the data returned. I have it so that the client sends the message, which calls a send message script on my webserver, the script then makes a message file on the webserver and then returns a success or failure back to the client. Then for the client to view this message, it would have to call a script that checks the server for a message file with a message for him. If it finds one, it sends the message back, if not, it sends a response about not having messages.p  pThis technique works perfectly besides the fact that the client either would have to manually refresh to check to see if he had messages, or a background thread would have to refresh every few seconds. That would be fine, however that would use data if the user was on a mobile network. Not to mention the kind of resources a background loop would pull if it was refreshing at a speed that would be convenient.p  pSo, I decided on a second idea, this would be a server programmed in Java, which would communicate over sockets. The user would send the message as a packet over the socket and the server would check to see who it was meant to go to. If the person is online, it passes the message along to that user. However this method requires a constant connection between the client and the server and that is unreliable because what if the user is in the car and data cuts out. Or some other situation where the connection gets severed. Then it would throw errors and have to reconnect.p  pAnyhow, my question is which technique is better. Or are they both terrible If so, what is the correct way of doing this Thanks in advance.p

During this time, they should not be able to make a new movement.p  pThe system Ive been using is that I have a timer class, like thisp  precodeimport time  def GetSystemTimeInMS Return system time in milliseconds     systime  roundtime.clock1000, 0     return systime  class Timer def initself,time     time  time for which the timer runs     self.time  time     self.starttime  0     self.stoptime   0  def StartTimerself     starttime  time at which the timer was started     self.starttime  GetSystemTimeInMS     self.stoptime   self.starttime  self.time  def TimerIsStoppedself     if GetSystemTimeInMS gt self.stoptime         return True     else         return False codepre  pThe player class has a Timer objectp  precodeself.MoveTimer  TimerTILETOTILEDELAY codepre  pWhen the player presses the Wkey, a function is called that checks for player.MoveTimer.TimerIsStopped. If it returns True, it calls player.MoveTimer.StartTimer and starts a new movement to the next position.p  pIn the even loop, the updatedt function is set to happen 30 times a secondp  precodedef updatedt     if player.MoveTimer.TimerIsStopped         player.UpdatePosition  pyglet.clock.scheduleintervalupdate, 130 codepre  pNow, by my logic, updatedt should check 30 times a second whether or not enough time has passed to warrant the player a new movement event. However, for some reason the player moves much faster at lower FPS.p  pWhen my FPS is around 30, the player moves much faster than in areas where there are less tile sprites, pumping the framerate to 60. In areas where FPS is high, the player indeed by my measurements moves almost twice as slowly.p  pI just cannot figure it out, nor did I find anything off the internet after a day of searching. Some help would be much appreciated.p  pEdit The code that starts the MoveTimerp  precodedef StartMovementself, newnextpos     self.RequestedMovement  False     if self.GetCanMoveAgain          self.SetNextPosnewnextpos         self.SetMoveDirectionself.GetDirection           Start the timer for the movement         self.MoveTimer.StartTimer         self.SetIsMovingTrue         self.SetStartedMovingTrue          self.SetWalkingTrue          self.SetNeedUpdateTrue          self.MOVEEVENTHANDLER.CreateMoveEvent codepre  pGetCanMoveAgain returns the value of player.canmoveagain, which is set back to True by the UpdatePosition in updatedtp

Negative 6691 pI am working on a project where a dynamic library code.socode is injected in some target program at runtime dynamic instrumentation. The library handles its own memory using codemmapmunmapcode. For security reasons, it is required that some mapped region in the library emonlyem be writable through the exposed APIs from the library. p  pWhat weve done is emtoggleem the write flag of the memory region using codemprotectcode and codePROTWRITEcode at the prologueepilogue of the library functions, e.g. p  precodevoid foovoid    mprotectaddr, PAGESIZE, PROTREAD  PROTWRITE   ...   ...   mprotectaddr, PAGESIZE, PROTREAD  codepre  pThis works fine for single threaded applications. For multithreaded applications, other tasks in the same process might be able to write to the mapped library region if a context switch to a different task in the same process takes place emafterem the codePROTWRITEcode was set so the memory is writable and embeforeem it was cleared.p  pSo, the question is Is it possible to disable other tasks in the process until codefoocode returns If not, how do you suggest working around thisp

Individuals may have no data after a certain point, or have gaps in the data. Gaps in the data might not have a row of NAs, but instead might be missing entirely from the dataset. I want to be able to keep individuals that appear n consecutive times, and have fewer than n gaps in timeor by specific column name.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions24600716dropvariableinpaneldatainrconditionalbasedonadefinednumberofconsecDrop variable in panel data in R conditional based on a defined number of consecutive observationsap  pThe question above is similar to mine. However there are some periods where I have no data instead of all NAs. That is why counting NAs is not enough, I looked into measure the distance in time.

File structure and other assorted names changed due to NDA, and code not related to the problem removedp  precodedefineROOT, dirnameFILE requireconfigconfig.php requireincludesincludes.php   caching  function cacheCategories      dirPath  ROOT . cachecategories     cacheFileName  categories.json     cacheFilePath  dirPath . cacheFileName     cacheTime  86400      if fileexistscacheFilePath ampamp time  cacheTime lt filemtimecacheFilePath   cache file exists and is fresh         cachedJSON  readfilecacheFilePath          if cachedJSON  false              throw new ExceptionCould not read from cache file               else          includeoncesiteload.php         categories  loadcategoriestree         cachedJSON  jsonencodecategories          if isdirdirPath              mkdirdirPath                   fp  fopencacheFilePath, w          if fp  false              throw new ExceptionCould not open cache file                   if flockfp, LOCKEX              writeResult  fwritefp, cachedJSON              if writeResult  false                  throw new ExceptionCould not write to cache                           flockfp, LOCKUN             fclosefp                    return cachedJSON   global page page  new Page pagegtsetDefaultLanguageen  echo cacheCategories codepre  pAs you can see, its pretty simple.

Negative 6691 pSo I have this table where rows have one of the two set of attributes. A row starts its life with one set, then goes into second set and stays that way until removed. Both sets have one attribute in common.p  pThe problem is that Id like to transform row from first attribute set into second attribute set with just update. I do not want to do a read, just to get that single, common attribute. I figured out, that if you do an UpdateRequest, every attribute not contained in the update is wiped out. Since the common attribute is a numerical i figured out Ill cheat a bit with ADD attribute action like thisp  precodenew AttributeValueUpdate   .withActionAttributeAction.ADD   .withValuenew AttributeValue.withN0 codepre  pAccording to a hrefhttpdocs.aws.amazon.comamazondynamodblatestAPIReferenceAPIUpdateItem.html relnofollowdocumentationa, this action in conjuction with attribute type Number is supposed to add value 0 in this case to current attribute value. However, this behaves like PUT action as after the operation this attribute has 0 as its value.p  pSo the questions arep  ol lipIs ADD action working like Im expecting it to In other words, does adding 0 to attribute makes it survive UpdateRequest If so, what can I be doing wrong as it doesnt seem to be working for mepli lipAssuming ADD action is working as intended and I just have misinterpreted its role  is there any other way to preserve attribute value during update pli ol

Negative 6691 pMy goal is to build a personalized information retrieval system. The database from which Im going to collect documents is PubMed. p  pHere are the steps I need to perform.  For a keyword strongemk1emstrong I have a set of 5 predefined terms. Lets say they are strongemk1w1, k1w2, ..., k1w5emstrong. When the keyword strongemk1emstrong is entered in my system, it should automatically search it in PubMed. Lets say PubMed gives 10 results for keyword strongemk1emstrong. Then I have to score the predefined words appearing in each of the 10 documents. p  pExample  p  pFor strongemk1w1emstrong, score  5.p  pIf strongemk1w1emstrong appears in title, score  10p  pIf strongemk1wkemstrong appears twice in the title, multiple the score by 2.p  pTherefore, if strongemk1w1emstrong appears in the title of a document the score it gets  5102  100p  pLikewise, I have to weigh the other terms as well. And then the documents with high scores should be retrieved from PubMed. p  pThe set of predefined words differ for each key word. For keyword strongemk2emstrong, the word list may be strongemk2w1, k2w1,...k2w5emstrong.  The no. of predefined words wont changep  pFor this, Im going to use a PHP DOM parser. Do I have download the documents when weighing and scoring them Cant I weigh and score terms without downloading and then to download only the ones that get high scores If I hevae to download, will I need a large database  p

Negative 6691 pIm looking for a fast way in C to hash numbers 32bit numbers more or less uniformly between 0 and 254.  255 is reserved for a special purpose. p  pAs an added constraint, Im looking for a method that would map well to being used with ISAspecific vector intrinsics or to a language like OpenCL or CUDA without introducing control flow divergence between the vector lanesthreads.p  pOrdinarily, I would just use the following code to hash the number between 0 and 255, as this is just a fast way of doing x mod 256.p  precodeinline uint8t hashuint32t x  return x amp 255  codepre  pI could just give in and use the followingp  precodeinline uint8t hashuint32t x  return x  255  codepre  pHowever, this solution seems unimaginative and unlikely to be the highest performing solution.

If such divergence does occur, it will reduce parallel efficiency, as the divergent paths will have to be run in series.pli lipIt looks like it could be troublesome for a branch predictor not applicable on common GPU architectures as the code path that executes depends on the value of the input. Therefore, if there is a mix of small and large values interspersed with one another, this code will likely sacrifice some performance due to a moderate number of branch mispredictions.pli ol  pAny recommendations on alternatives that I could use are most welcome.  Alternatively, let me know if what I am asking for is unreasonable.p

Negative 6691 pIm making a website that lets users make post right from the front page. Also on the front page I have a live update of the questions posted. Every question in that live feed has its own little container that contains the title of the post and some other details. When the user clicks on a post a Bootstrap modal opens. There you can see the title of the post, post details and a live comment feed. Both the post feed on the front page and the comment feed of every post are updated every 15 secondsthe comment feed starts updating when its modal is open and when any modal is open the post feed on the front page stops updating. All of the live features are working through jQueryAjax. What I have noticed is that even on my local server this takes some noticeable time to load. My database is in MySQL and I have made severalaround 15 test posts and added comments to some.p  pThe code for the post feed is basicallyp  precodefunction updatePosts postContainer.loadpostpull.php  setIntervalupdatePosts, 15000 codepre  pAnd the php file just returns all posts within divs, with the details of posts with a modal and some scripts.p  pThe comment feed of each post is quite similar except it pulls the comments that have the parent ID of the opened modal.p  pSo my question is  what is the most efficient way of doing the live updates, because if the loading time is noticeable now, on a local server and with a handfull of posts, it will be unuseable on a real server with people constantly posting.p
