The hackish solution to that question doesnt work if I want to chain in more scopes, so Im asking again here, with a bit more information as to where the issue is coming from.p  precode Relevant code only... class Publication lt ActiveRecordBase   hasmany issues   hasmany articles, through gt issues end  class Issue lt ActiveRecordBase   belongsto publication   hasmany articles end  class Article lt ActiveRecordBase   belongsto issue   defineindex do     has issuepublicationid, as gt publicationid   end end codepre  pTherefore, Id expect the following code to workp  precodePublication.first.articles.search foobar codepre  pHowever, it returns the following errorp  precodeRuntimeError Missing Attribute for Foreign Key publicationid     from homematchurailstorchvendorpluginsthinkingsphinxlibthinkingsphinxactiverecordhasmanyassociation.rb18in search codepre  pThis seems to imply that the publicationid attribute that I specifically set does not exist.

Making this question not particularly urgent. But I definitely am curious as to why this occurs. Any thoughtsp

Negative 92815 pSo, folks. Got an interesting occurrence going on here.p  pI have a windows forms application made in VS2008 which has, up until recently, been connecting to a SQL Server 2008 database.

Previously, Insert and Delete seemed to commit changes when they ran.p  p2 Using an UPDATE command to manually commit changes works  added records remain, and deleted records stay gone, but...p  p3 If I rebuild the solution for whatever reason, the database resets to what it was when I first changed the location of the database.p  pDoes anyone have an idea as to what Im doing differently now that would create this type of behaviorp

Negative 92815 pHow to find out the senders ip address of a udp packet that was received on a device running iOS 3.2 or higherp  pFor example, if using Python on a computer, Id use codeSocketServer.UDPServercode which takes a subclass of codeSocketServer.BaseRequestHandlercode which defines the codehandlecode callback.

Negative 92815 pI am making a concerted effort to wrap my head around Rspec in order to move towards more of a TDDBDD development pattern. However, Im a long way off and struggling with some of the fundamentalsp  pLike, when exactly should I be using mocksstubs and when shouldnt Ip  pTake for example this scenario I have a codeSitecode model that codehasmany blogscode and the codeBlogcode model codehasmany articlescode. In my codeSitecode model I have a callback filter that creates a default set of blogs and articles for every new site. I want to test that code, so here goesp  precodedescribe Site, when created do    include SiteSpecHelper    beforeeach do     site  Site.create validsiteattributes   end    it should have 2 blogs do     site.should have2.blogs   end    it should have 1 main blog article do     site.blogs.findbyslugmain.should have1.articles   end    it should have 2 secondary blog articles do     site.blogs.findbyslugsecondary.should have2.articles   end  end codepre  pNow, if I run that test, everything passes. However, its also pretty slow as its creating a new Site, two new Blogs and three new Articles  for every single test So I wonder, is this a good candidate for using stubs Lets give it a gop  precodedescribe Site, when created do    include SiteSpecHelper    beforeeach do     site  Site.new     blog  Blog.new     article  Article.new     Site.stubcreate.andreturnsite     Blog.stubcreate.andreturnblog     Article.stubcreate.andreturnarticle     site  Site.create validsiteattributes   end    it should have 2 blogs do     site.stubblogs.andreturn[blog, blog]     site.should have2.blogs   end    it should have 1 main blog article do     blog.stubarticles.andreturn[article]     site.stubchainblogs, findbyslug.withmain.andreturnblog     site.blogs.findbyslugmain.should have1.articles   end    it should have 2 secondary blog articles do     blog.stubarticles.andreturn[article, article]     site.stubchainblogs, findbyslug.withsecondary.andreturnblog     site.blogs.findbyslugsecondary.should have2.articles   end  end codepre  pNow all the tests still pass, and things are a bit speedier too. But, Ive doubled the length of my tests and the whole exercise just strikes me as utterly pointless, because Im no longer testing my code, Im just testing my tests.p  pNow, either Ive completely missed the point of mocksstubs, or Im approaching it fundamentally wrong, but Im hoping someone might be able to eitherp  ul liImprove me tests above so it uses stubs or mocks in a way that actually tests my code, rather than my tests.li liOr, tell me if I should even be using stubs here  or whether in fact this is completely unnecessary and I should be writing these models to the test database.li ul

According to the a hrefhttpresearch.microsoft.comenusprojectscontractsuserdoc.pdf relnofollowuser manuala section 3, a contractmethod, i.e. codeRequirecode or codeEnsurecode, is not allowed in overriding methodsproperties or interface implementations. The contract methods should be declared in the root virtualabstract method and since you cant declare code in an abstract method, you have to work with the codeContractClassAttributecode and codeContractClassForAttributecode. The same goes for contractmethods for interfacemembersand their implementations. p  pBut what if I want to use an interface I havent created myself For example codeIListltTgtcode doesnt implement these contract methods, but I cant set the codeContractClassAttributecode on it either.

Negative 92815 pIm new to C Sharp, and writing a game w the XNA Framework. Ive created a project thats a heavily modified version of the Platformer XNA starter kit.p  pIm seeing seemingly random fluctuations with the framerate. Sometimes itll run at 60 FPS the whole time, sometimes itll start at 60 FPS then drop to 4952, and othertimes itll drop to 4952 immediately. Using Fraps to display framerate not recording video to disk.p  pThe unique nature of this game requires that it run at 60 FPS consistently.p  pSo it seems some race condition or random factor is causing a difference between individual runs of the exe. Numerous rebuilds make no difference.p  pThis fluctuation occurs on both my desktop and laptop with exactly the same frequency, so its not an issue w hardware, antivirus, etc.p  pIve searched about how to lock framerates in XNA, and my code seems to be doing much of what it needs to do, including an attempt to clamp at 60 FPS using IsFixedTimeStep, SynchronizeWithVerticalRetrace.p  pThe game is absolutely capable of 60 FPS from beginning to end, I see it all the time. When its running at 60 FPS it does not tax CPU, RAM or any other resource as far as I can tell.p  pAnyone else experienced thisp  pThanks,  Sp
Negative 92815 pSo Im trying to get the results from a stored proc 200k rows into an Excel file from ASP.NET but having a few difficulties.

If I open and save as a native Excel file it gets it down to 30megs.

Ideally Id like to find a third party Excel library that can write a native Excel file with 200,000 rows without killing the server, any ideasp

Negative 92815 pIm working on an ASP.net application.p  pI had a problem with a user control Id designed called codeLocationSelectorcode.  It worked great, but I couldnt use it within an ASPUpdatePanel.  I learned, by browsing SO, that I needed to put my inline javascript in an external file and register it with codeScriptManagercode so that there are no codeResponse.Writecode calls in the Javascript.p  pNext, I discovered that the control worked at first, but when I enclosed it within the ASPUpdatePanel, it would stop functioning after the first AJAX postback.  I read that to fix that, I needed to replace my codedocument.readycode call with codefunction pageLoadcode which is automatically executed with each ASP.net page load.p  pSeveral of my pages in my ASP.net application work fine and I was really impressed with how well the framework seemed to drive the application.  However, to my dismay, I discovered that my codeLocationSelectorcode control no longer works emat allem on three of my pages.  The HTML renders, but the pageLoad which uses jQuery to bind events on control elements does not fire.p  pI verified this but putting codealertpageLoadcode as the first line of my codepageLoadcode function.  On the pages that work, I see the alert.  On the pages that dont work, I never see the alert, even on the initial page load.p  pWhat kind of problem could be causing the codepageLoadcode function on my user control codeLocationSelectorcode to execute on some pages, but not othersp

So when this ReadLine function is called, if someone else reaches the node, theyre locked out. I cant figure out how to make a timelimit on the amount of time ReadLine waits for a response before quitting the thread.

Negative 92815 pSince Apple only ships SDK 10.6 with Xcode4, developing PPC applications with Xcode4 became impossible. While it is possible to develop applications with Xcode4 that can also run on 10.5 and maybe even on 10.4 systems by selecting SDK 10.6, but deployment target 10.5 or 10.4, they will only run on Intel Macs because you need at least SDK 10.5 for building PPC applications.p  pFurther there are some rare cases, where you really need to build against an SDK prior to 10.6 for full platform support, e.g. if certain deprecated functionality has vanished completely from the 10.6 SDK, but youll have to use it and dynamic linking is not always the best option in those cases. Also linking against an earlier SDK sometimes will ease development as functionality you are not supposed to use, as it would cause incompatibility to earlier OS versions, wont be available and any attempt to use it anyhow immediately leads to compiler or linker errors.p  pLast but not least Apple has also removed GCC 4.0 support from Xcode4, which may be necessary for certain software to build correctly and Apple has never allowed to compile software with GCC 4.2 when using SDK 10.4, even though I hardly believe that this would really cause any issues, after all software built with GCC 4.2 and SDK 10.6 can also run on Mac OS 10.4 without any issues as long as the deployment target has been set correctly and no functionality that is unavailable under MacOS 10.4 has been used.p  pOf course you can always have a parallel installation of Xcode3 next to Xcode4, but that means you must forgo all the great new features of Xcode4 and keep working with the outdated Xcode3 IDE. It would certainly be much better if you could also manage all your old projects within the same IDE as your new ones and benefit from any new features available. Not all projects can be made 10.6 or Intel only in the foreseeable future. Further Im strictly against abolishing support for older platforms earlier than would be really necessary.p  pstrongCan we restore this functionality to Xcode4strongp

This xml file wont be modified in and of itself, its read only, but it WILL be encrypted when its packaged, so will have to be decrypted by the app.p  pThe second part of the question is, once I have the xml in the directory it will live in, how do I open it and parse its contents into a list view The goal is to have the listviews sort of generate from the nodes of the xml. Meaning, the root node would generate the first options in the list view. As you click on the items corresponding with the nodes, a new listview will be generated based on what that subnode contains. Its basically using listviews to browse through an xml file.p  pThanks for your help I am sort of new to Android and Java so please dont assume I know that much  p

Negative 92815 pI have strings stored in various objects, for example a, b, c[27] ie 5 different strings c[2],...c[6], d.s, e.s[] ie all strings stored in the e.s list. I need to loop over all these strings on various places in the code and modify emtheseem variables in the loops. Assigning the modified strings to new variables would not work as there are other functions expecting the modified strings in the original variables. How can I do that efficiently in Pythonp  pIf I could create a list of references to the strings then I could just always iterate over itp  precodestrreflst[referencea, referenceb, referenced.s] strreflst.extend[referencec[27]] strreflst.extend[referencee.s[]] ... for refstrng in strreflst   dostringmodifications1dereferencerefstrng ... functionusingthemodifiedvariables1 ... for refstrng in strreflst   dostringmodifications2dereferencerefstrng ... functionusingthemodifiedvariables2 etc codepre  pHowever, I am not aware of referencedereference analogues in Python and I guess it would not be the right way in Python anywayp

Applications which fail to do so will not be   accepted for distribution via the Shop.p      pArea Associated Technical Recommendation or Solution if your   application requires large amount of data including but not limited   to images, audio or video content, you should download those   resources at runtime and store them in the larger partition of the   device. If your application is going to request and store more than   100MB of data or resource you MUST abide by the the following   restrictionsp      pYour application must clearly and explicitly state in the description   provided that a large amount of data is useddelivered by the   application.

Negative 92815 pFirst of all, I do not have any code written yet, I am only in the designthinking phase, so Im doing some research on how to do what I want to do, this post is to get some bearings before I start coding.p  pSo, I want to make an application that takes some info along with an image from the camera preferably and uploads it to a database in my test computer, and maybe to a dedicated server later on.p  pWhat Im thinking is to make some web services, including a transfer service, so I can download and upload the images from and to my database, the database is MongoDB a NoSQL database NoRDBMS. This database is based around documents, which makes the queries superfast, and storing binary files stops being an issue.p  pBut, and heres my first question strongIs it good to uploaddownload a file using a web servicestrong especially for mobile devices. If not what can I use, if its not an issue, what framework should I use Im thinking Axis2, and why. I will try to make the file size the smallest possible using some libraries to improve transfer times.p  pThe second question would be if strongis is better to make a batch upload at specific times of day, or upload the files immediately after the operations are finished on the devicestrong, I know this is a simple question, but this is a quest of enlightenment and I want to know, especially on mobile devices what is best.p  pNow, strongWhat kind of stream should I use for the uploaddownloadstrong Ive been reading, and converting an image to a byte array consumes a lot of CPU, and I dont want my application to be sluggish, but this is the easiest way. Then theres using codeDataHandlerscode for the transfer, but it seems complicated but not so harsh on the CPU If Im wrong, please do correct me on anything I say here, so I dont know what to use.p  pThanks for your time, and for reading this wall of text, but Im trying to improve my skills, so any help would be greatly appreciated.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pI found this thread extremely useful for what Im trying to do p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5415390sendingpicturestoawebserver54154705415470Threadap

Negative 92815 pI am extending an existing opensource project, which already has a very advanced LexerParserTreeParser in ANTLR. I would like to adhere to the current directory structure, so I created my own directory where I would like to put my new already written grammar files. They are importing these three original grammar files and to compile the code, I can use java org.antlr.Tool, where I can specify one directory to search for imported grammars with lib option argument.p  pMy problem is that these three original imported grammar files have some imports themselves and again in different directory. To illustrate inheritanceimporting going to topp  precodeAbstract syntax directory lexer           parser           tree parser Original syntax directory lexer           parser           tree parser My new   syntax directory lexer           parser           tree parser codepre  pThis is the hierarchy. The trouble I am encountering is how to specify Abstract syntax directory and also Original syntax directory at once with the lib option on the command line for the ANTLR tool or any other solution which would allow me to compile my grammar importing the original one with the given directories structure.p  pI tried lib directory1 directory2, that just appears to ignore the directory2 and then tries to compile it, which it cannot, because it is a directory, not an ANTLR grammar. I tried specifying lib directory1 lib directory2, the lib directory2 just overwrites the lib directory1 then.p  pIt is what I believe a fairly basic need to specify multiple directories to search in, in any more complicated system of grammars, therefore I am sure I missed something. I just cannot google anything useful out.p  pIF you need any more details, I am happy to provide them, it is my master thesis extending an open source project, so I do not need to keep anything secret.  If it is not possible, I can live without it, but would really like to keep the consistency of the original project.p

Negative 92815 pSay I have an absurdly large text file. I would not think my file would grow larger than 500mb, but for the sake of scalability and my own curiosity, lets say it is on the order of a few gig.p  pMy end goal is to map it to an array of sentences separated by   . and for all intents and purposes  and each sentence to an array of words. I was then going to use numpy for some statistical analysis.p  pWhat would be the most scalable way to go about doing thisp  pPS I thought of rewriting the file to have one sentence per line, but I ran into problems trying to load the file into memory. I know of the solution where you read off chucks of data in one file, manipulate them, and write them to another, but that seems inefficient with disk memory. I know, most people would not worry about using 10gig of scratch space nowadays, but it does seem like there ought to be a way of directly editing chucks of the file. p

Negative 92815 pUnder Windows 7 strongx64strong, when I try to profile an strongx86strong executable with the latest version of Dependency Walker 2.2.6000 the profiling process always hangs at a certain point. Most of the time the last DLL that is loaded is codecwindowssyswow64URLMON.DLLcode, so it seems that something inside that DLL is causing a problem. Profiling the same executable on Windows 7 strongx86strong works flawlessly.p  pI have googled quite extensively, but couldnt come up with a solution to the problem. One suggestion that I found was to uninstall IE 8 or IE 9 and replace it with IE 7, but this doesnt really help. The only effect that I can observe is that with IE 7 the profiling process hangs at a different DLL codeiertutil.dllcode, if I remember correctly, also from the systems codesyswow64code folder.p  pSo my question is How can I get Dependency Walker to profile x86 applications on x64 Windows 7 Of course, it would also be nice to know why the problem exists in the first place p  pSome final notesp  ul liI am using the x86 version of Dependency Walker because I want to profile an x86 executableli liRunning Dependency Walker as administrator does not helpli liAll profiling options marked as may fail on WOW64 are disabledli liThe executable I am currently using as a test case to reproduce the problem is the Sumatra PDF viewer a hrefhttpblog.kowalczyk.infosoftwaresumatrapdfdownloadfreepdfviewer.htmldownload linka because it is a simple .exe that does not need installationli ul

Negative 92815 pSorry for the bad title. Couldnt think of a better one...p  pIm doing a software that is configurable with loaded data from XML. User can define the max width of an TextField and the TextFields are multiline and wrapping happens when the text wouldnt fit the width. Text for the TextFields is also loaded from the XML file and the length is arbitrary.p  pBecause TextField doesnt have neither buttonMode or useHandCursor properties I made TextFields children of sprites. So for every TextField there is a sprite as a parent.p  pThen the real problem p  pTextFields are actually the sprites with a TextField as a childp  pThe TextFields should not be clickable outside of the text in them. At the moment it seems like that the sprites extend to the full width of the TextFields and therefore user can actually click the TextFields from an area where there is no text.p  pI tried to change the size of the sprite, checked the AS3 reference and now I know why everything disappeared after that.p  pSo I need a solution in which, the TextFields have buttomMode and useHandCursor enabled and the container should be able to cut off the area where there is no text.p

Negative 92815 pIm using a Relative layout as the root or parent container and I have two buttons to place inside this Layout. The buttons need to be placed one on top of the other. The problem is that I want to position these buttons so that they appear below the center of the view but not directly below. That is within the bottom half of the view I want the buttons to appear halfway along that half portion. I tried adding a the buttons as children of a RelativeLayout that was centered in the middle inside the parent RelativeLayout and that sort of achieves what Im trying to but then the Eclipse complains with a warning stating that one set of Relative Layout tags is useless and that I should consider getting rid of it.p  pThen I tried giving a one of the buttons a top margin with respect to its parent and then placing the other button under the this button with the top margin.

How is that feature achieved Anchoring a frame to a specific location of the window such that device orientation changes, and thereby reconfiguring the device coordinate system X and Y values change for each frame in the entire viewwindow has no effect in redrawing the frame. Can this be achieved easily by specifying attributes to a layout xml file Or does this involve programming complex code If programming is the only option, Id try and prefer to keep it as simplistic as possible. p  pThanks.p

Negative 92815 pIm working on a Qt app, and at some point I have a class I name it here engine that is governing the program it has a signal with a timeout which makes the class to draw, and evolve the app logic. Morevoer, it receives events that are caught from a QGraphicsScene.p  pEach engine tick, the update is called on the Scene, updating the drawing according to the app evolution.p  pNaturally, I want the drawing to be synchronized with the reactions of the events, otherwise, a drawing of some object could be made while the reaction of a event was destroying that same object, causing a SegFault.p  pIve tried using a queue on the engine such that I would only make the engine to react to those events on a specific place of a update, thus not interfering with the drawing part.p  pTwo problems rised p  ol liI cannot make a copy of a QGraphicsEvent.

Subversion runs this hook by invoking a program  script, executable, binary, etc. named precommit for which  this file is a template, with the following ordered arguments     [1] REPOSPATH   the path to this repository    [2] TXNNAME     the name of the txn about to be committed     [STDIN] LOCKTOKENS  the lock tokens are passed via STDIN.     If STDIN contains the line LOCKTOKENSn the n denotes a    single newline, the lines following it are the lock tokens for    this commit.  The end of the list is marked by a line containing    only a newline character.     Each lock token line consists of a URIescaped path, followed    by the separator character , followed by the lock token string,    followed by a newline.   The default working directory for the invocation is undefined, so  the program should set one explicitly if it cares.   If the hook program exits with success, the txn is committed but  if it exits with failure nonzero, the txn is aborted, no commit  takes place, and STDERR is returned to the client.   The hook  program can use the svnlook utility to help it examine the txn.   On a Unix system, the normal procedure is to have precommit  invoke other programs to do the real work, though it may do the  work itself too.       NOTE THE HOOK PROGRAM MUST NOT MODIFY THE TXN, EXCEPT        FOR REVISION PROPERTIES like svnlog or svnauthor.        This is why we recommend using the readonly svnlook utility.    In the future, Subversion may enforce the rule that precommit    hooks should not modify the versioned data in txns, or else come    up with a mechanism to make it safe to do so by informing the    committing client of the changes.  However, right now neither    mechanism is implemented, so hook writers just have to be careful.   Note that precommit must be executable by the users who will  invoke it typically the user httpd runs as, and that user must  have filesystemlevel permission to access the repository.   On a Windows system, you should name the hook program  precommit.bat or precommit.exe,  but the basic idea is the same.   The hook program typically does not inherit the environment of  its parent process.  For example, a common problem is for the  PATH environment variable to not be set to its usual value, so  that subprograms fail to launch unless invoked via absolute path.  If youre having unexpected problems with a hook program, the  culprit may be unusual or missing environment variables.    Here is an example hook script, for a Unix binsh interpreter.  For more examples and prewritten hooks, see those in  the Subversion repository at  httpsvn.apache.orgreposasfsubversiontrunktoolshookscripts and  httpsvn.apache.orgreposasfsubversiontrunkcontribhookscripts   REPOS1 TXN2   Make sure that the log message contains some text.

Negative 92815 pI currently have a RadGridView that I attach a context menu to. I subscribe to the ItemClick event and handle whatever was clicked in that method. This worked fine with strongRadControls for Silverlight Q2 2012strong, but after applying the strongRadControls for Silverlight5 2012 2 0813 hotfixstrong, the functionality is partially broken. p  pThe functionality I want still works inbrowser, but when running the application out of browser OOB, clicking anywhere or pressing keys on a keyboard after opening the context menu by right clicking on the GridView causes the context menu to close. The closed event is never fired after clicking on the context menu, it is only fired if I click outside of the context menu. The context menu opening event always gets hit, but the item clicked event is only triggered when the application is running in browser.p  pThe only way I was able to keep the menu open and available to click on is by setting the ContextMenu property StaysOpen to true, but I do not want the menu to stay open like this. I checked the themes for the RadContextMenu and they look identical in both of these Telerik versions. p  pHere is an example of the code behind the xaml contains of 1 gridview named gridp  precode public MainPage    InitializeComponent   RadContextMenu contextMenu  new RadContextMenu  FontSize  10    contextMenu.Opening  ContextMenuOpeningHandler   contextMenu.ItemClick  ContextMenuItemClickHandler   StyleManager.SetThemecontextMenu, StyleManager.GetThemegrid   RadContextMenu.SetContextMenugrid, contextMenu   private void ContextMenuItemClickHandlerobject sender, RadRoutedEventArgs e     new RadWindow  Content  Item Clicked .ShowDialog   private void ContextMenuOpeningHandlerobject sender, RadRoutedEventArgs e    RadContextMenu contextMenu  RadContextMenusender   contextMenu.IsEnabled  true   contextMenu.Items.Clear   contextMenu.Items.Addnew RadMenuItem  Header  item 1    contextMenu.Items.Addnew RadMenuItem  Header  item 2   codepre  pAny help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.p  pThanks, Mishap

Negative 92815 pIve implemented a thread pool using codeboostasiocode, and some number codeboostthreadcode objects  calling codeboostasioioserviceruncode.  However, a requirement that Ive been given is to have a way to monitor all threads for health.  My intent is to make a simple sentinel object that can be passed through the thread pool  if it makes it through, then we can assume that the thread is still processing work.p  pHowever, given my implementation, Im not sure how if I can monitor all the threads in the pool reliably.  Ive simply delegated the thread function to codeboostasioioserviceruncode, so posting a sentinel object into the codeioservicecode instance wont guarantee which thread will actually get that sentinel and do the work.p  pOne option may be to just periodically insert the sentinel, and hope that it gets picked up by each thread at least once in some reasonable amount of time, but that obviously isnt ideal.p  pTake the following example.  Due to the way that the handler is coded, in this instance we can see that each thread will do the same amount of work, but in reality I will not have control of the handler implementation, some can be long running while others will be almost immediate.p  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltboostasio.hppgt include ltvectorgt include ltboostthread.hppgt include ltboostbind.hppgt  void handler     stdcout ltlt boostthisthreadgetid ltlt n    boostthisthreadsleepboostposixtimemilliseconds100   int mainint argc, char argv     boostasioioservice svc3     stduniqueptrltboostasioioserviceworkgt worknew boostasioioserviceworksvc     boostthread oneboostbindampboostasioioservicerun, ampsvc    boostthread twoboostbindampboostasioioservicerun, ampsvc    boostthread threeboostbindampboostasioioservicerun, ampsvc     svc.posthandler    svc.posthandler    svc.posthandler    svc.posthandler    svc.posthandler    svc.posthandler    svc.posthandler    svc.posthandler    svc.posthandler    svc.posthandler     work.reset     three.join    two.join    one.join     return 0  codepre

Probably I may still understand what went wrong, catching codeExceptionInInitializerErrorcode even if that just sounds wrong to me and checking its cause I still did not try to do so but I think its possible.p  pI need that object, because in case the exception is recoverable e.g. MissingConfigurationException the program will not exit and will need that object.p  pShould I avoid the static initializer I could do something likep  precodeprivate static final Configuration conf  null  Constructor      if conf  null           Attempts to load JDBC driver          try              Class.forNamecom.mysql.jdbc.Driver          catch ClassNotFoundException e              throw new DBConfigurationExceptionJDBC Driver not found., e                   Attempts to load configuration          conf  loadConfiguration       codepre  pBut even this one sounds incorrect to me exceptions may be thrown emonly at the first attempt of useem which I know will be at startup because I have to do that checks, strongthat isstrong when the class is loaded. So it would be theoretically more correct the first way. p  pWhat should I do Which way is more correctp  pThe problem is that the class with static initializer emNEEDSem both driver and configuration, so it emSHOULDNTem be used before that both of them are available. p

Negative 92815 pIm studying intrinsic functions impact on performance, and Im a little bit confused they seem to have no impact at all Im trying to fill an array of doubles with two different functions and I see no differences. I allocated the array with a call to alignedmalloc with alignment parameter set to 8. I use Visual Studio 2008 and I compiled in Release mode, both with and without optimizations O2  Od and both with and without intrinsics Oi  all the four combinations. Two different versions followp  precodeifdef NOINTRIN  void myfilldouble vett, double value, int N      double last  vett  N     while vett  last              vett  value        else  void myfilldouble vett, double value, int N      double last  vett  N       set classically unaligned data, if any     while 0xF amp uintptrtvett ampamp vett  last          vett  value      m128d vett  m128dvett     uintptrt fff0  0 ltlt 4      round address to nearest aligned data setting to zero least significant 4 bits     m128d last  m128d fff0 amp uintptrtlast      process until secondlast element to manage odd values of N     for  vett lt last1 vett               vett  mmset1pdvalue           vett  doublevett     whilevett  last         vett  value       endif codepre  pAs a last specification, I aligned my data to 8B and not to 16 because I plan to execute this function in a multithreaded way on different portions of the array. So, also aligning data to 16B I couldnt be sure that all the portions of the array would be aligned es. 303 elements, 3 threads, 101 element per thread, 1st portion aligned to 16B, 2nd portion starting  vett1018  unaligned. Thats why I tried to implement an alignmentagnostic function. I tried to fill an array of 1M elements on my Intel Atom CPU N570  1.66 GHz and I got always the same execution time. So... whats wrong with my approach Why I see no differences Thank you all in advance.p

Also how would we handle multidimensional searches i.e. name and category.p  pId like to do as much of the filtering as possible on the couchbase instance and ideally narrow it down to one record rather than having to filter when it comes back to the App Tier. Something like passing a dynamic value to the mapping function and only emitting documents that match.p  pI know you can use LINQ with couchbase to filter but if Ive read the docs correctly this filtering is still done clientside but at least if we could narrow down the returned dataset to a sensible subset, clientside filtering wouldnt be emsuchem a big deal.p  pCheersp

Negative 92815 pIm currently learning Java for several reasons, but one of the main ones being that its a very OOP orientated language, and writing code in Java is really helping me understand the core concepts behind OOP programming. p  pI am, however, having difficulty in defining the relationships between my classes. I understand the difference between inheritance and composition, but Im having some difficulty seeing the whole picture, and how all of my classes should work together as a whole.p  pAn example of how I would write a simple game of TicTac Toe using OOPp  ol lipCreate a codeGamecode class  creates an instance of the codegameBoardcode class, decides who starts first, keeps track of games won and lost, starts and ends the game.pli lipCreate a codegameBoardcode class  updates the tictactoe board, determines the next players turn, if a move is legal, and determines when there is a winnerpli lipCreate an abstract codePlayercode class  holds the players tile X or O, and contains a method that takes a codegameBoardcode instance as an argument and passes the move made by the player to the instance referencepli lipCreate a codeHumancode class that extends the codePlayercode class.

Has a method that takes a codegameBoardcode instance as an argument and analyses the gameboard for a winning move, a blocking move, or any other move, then makes a movepli ol  pThis is the approach I would take. However, Im having a little trouble relating all of the classes together.

What Im doing right now, is to mark two points wich I know the real world distance, to calculate the Euclidian distance between them, and than obtain the proportion. The question is, Only with two points can I make the correct MilimeterPixels proportion, or do I need to use 4 points, 2 for the XAxis and 2 for Yaxisp

Negative 92815 pI am working on an really large multi language project 1000 Classes  Configs  Scripts, with files distributed over network drives. I am having trouble fighting through the code, since the available Tools are not helping. The main problem is finding things. For the C Part VS with VAX can only find files and symbols which are in the solution. A lot of them are not. Same problem with Reshaper. Right now i am stuck with doing unindexed string and file searches, which is highly inefficient on a network drive. I heared that SourceInsight would be an option since it allows you to just specify the folders that are part of the project and than indexes them, but my company wont spent money on it. p  pSo my question ist what Tools are there available to fight through an incredible large amount of code And if possible they should be low cost or even freeopen source.p

Negative 92815 pI have a Wordpress site lastest version that I host and which is using the Silesia theme. I have installed the Slim Jetpack plugin and used its css editor to modify the look of the site.

This only happens on Firefox and not on IE, Chrome, or Safari. Other plugins that are installed include Subscribe2, Google Analytics, Subscribe2 widget, Manual Control for Jetpack, and WP Super Cache.p  pIt seems as if on Firefox, the site is first rendered using the original theme css and then repainted when it gets to the new css, but according to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6951108howiscssappliedbythebrowserandarerepaintsaffectedbyitHow is CSS applied by the browser, and are repaints affected by ita thats not how it should work.p  pDoes anyone have any idea about what this could bep

Negative 92815 pIm new to database design and Im trying to fix an existing mess.p  pI have a list of events with columns of parameters for the events, and each event has another table of details for the event.br For example, this could be a bunch of usages of scientific instruments, and then each runevent has a bunch of data collected while it was running.p  pWhat would  you recommend as a structure for thisp  pMy first idea is to have one table for the usage history, and then each row links to its own table that stores its collected data.  But how do I link the row to its table  Is there something like a foreignkey to a whole tablep  pMy second thought is to have one, single, table of collected data, and use Pkey, Fkey to link the usage history to the collected data.  But if I have hundreds of instruments, each collecting thousands of datapoints every day, then this one table will get very big maybe a GByear.  Would that be OK Im a microcontrollerembedded engineer, so anything over a MB seems huge to me.p  pAny suggestions would be appreciated.  Thanksp

Negative 92815 pI am trying to create a checklist from scratch in my android app. I want the user to be able to create custom goals in this checklist and check them off when they complete these goals. I was thinking about creating text boxes so the user can type in their goals, and then put a check box next to the text boxes. I want the app to save these custom goals the user creates when the user exits out of the app, and when they go back to that page, theyll see their goals still there. I was looking into using a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidetopicsdatadatastorage.html relnofollowthisa as the method to save those check boxes and texts. I was wondering if anyone had any recommendations or tips as to how to go about doing this. Or any suggestions that may be easier to do would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.p

Negative 92815 pI have been using SDL with Visual C for a while, mostly making practice games, but I find that I cant give the game to other people unless they have Visual C themselves.  One problem that I found using a Dependency Tracker was that the source files and such used both x86 emandem x64.  After looking through, I found that my Visual Studio source files were all in x64, so naturally I went through and modified my SDL files to be the x64 package instead of the x86.  After fussing about how it still insisted on not working, I found out that the program that I was exporting was in x86 all along  Ive been trying since to get it to export in x64 since, but I simply dont know how.  Can somebody help me do thisp

Negative 92815 pI got to some thinking and found out some of it myself, and from some a hrefhttpqgears.sourceforge.netgears.pdf relnofollowdigging arounda.p  pIt appears in great clarity that, combined with the fact that there is no operating system for Playstation the first ones hardware and just firmware, the games programmed for the Playstation were essentially the full monty, such as Final Fantasy VII for examplep  pFeatured multiple parts of code that interacted with each other, from a lowlevel kernel that handles the hardware data, changes, etc., to a user interface that controls interrupts from a PS controller, to a data bank that stores Clouds current HP, Tifas ATB gauge value, and the increment divisor to determine an attack flow byte.p  pSo technically speaking games made for Playstation strongwere the removeable kernels, gameplay interaction, and full executables.strong No kernel exists in PS hardware, so how could you program a game to be both a kernel with multiple modules and an interfacep  pDoes this mean that Playstation executable binaries stored as .ISO files were basically operating systemsp  pThe games module is the primary interface from the hardware level to the user level itself, so is it safe to say that all PS1 games were operating systems in a sortp  pBasically, its possible to make a game an operating system and a game, i.e., a fully interacting lowlevel data processor, device driver, interrupt handler, etc., all stored in an emulated filesystem container formatp  pI hope I was clear enough, as this quite confuses me when I try to get it down pat.p  pPS If this is better off in another section, please help migrate it there.

Negative 92815 pstrongBackgroundstrong We have a architecture with two applications one handles the layout with headers and footers Common the other is the application itself App. p  pCommon has a set of filters that process the request and a servlet that forwards dispatcher.forward the request to App. Common was before a pure Java application and App usually Spring MVC based. Common is now being rewritten with Spring.p  pstrongProblemstrong After the request has been processed in App, Common need to handle possible errors and then lookup translations from the application context message source. But instead the following exception occurp  precodejava.lang.ClassCastException org.springframework.web.context.support.AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext     at org.springframework.web.servlet.support.RequestContextUtils.getWebApplicationContextRequestContextUtils.java79     at org.springframework.web.servlet.support.RequestContext.initContextRequestContext.java209     at org.springframework.web.servlet.support.JspAwareRequestContext.initContextJspAwareRequestContext.java74     at org.springframework.web.servlet.support.JspAwareRequestContext.ltinitgtJspAwareRequestContext.java48     at org.springframework.web.servlet.tags.RequestContextAwareTag.doStartTagRequestContextAwareTag.java77     at org.apache.jsp.html.404jsp.jspxmethspring005fmessage005f0404jsp.java162 codepre  pIt seems that Spring looses track of the original ApplicationContext and the exception is thrown.

Negative 92815 pIm trying to setup a balanced cron on 3 servers. Right now,  I have about 30 jobs that should run at different dayshours on my servers. Each cron job starts with a minimum memory of 1GB and a max of 2 GB.

Now Im migrating jobs from quartz to cron so Im going to have about 2530 jobs in the cron. Obviously, this will cause them sometimes to interfere. This could cause an OutOfMemoryError. p  pMy question is, is there any way I could load balance the jobs between my 3 servers  if the first one has less than 2 GB free, run on server2, and so on  Im trying to avoid dividing the jobs  put 10 in the cron of each server, I wpould like to have them all in one cron and run them on the least busy machine.

Negative 92815 pI am trying to return a List from an AsyncTask that queries data to fill it from the internet. My UI passes the search parameters, the AsyncTask performs the search and returns a list of values. p  pI want to list the results, which have multiple elements per result, so my first question is a List return the most efficient way to do this to eventually put it in an Arraylist in the UI p  pI have also implemented a callback interface in the asynctask. I am having problems with the result though. The Arraylist is only displaying the last result of the search. I know it is the last result because I check online and see the value is the one that should be last. So I search and should get p  ol liChicken 1b broiled li listeak 3b choppedli lilamb 2b fried li ol  pand instead I only get p  ol lilamb 2b friedli ol  pin the arraylist. p  pIn addition, the UI is freezing after onpostexecute is called by the async. I am wondering, is the callback keeping the async open causing it to slow the UI thread Or perhaps is the arraylist just causing slow downs on the UI thread I get the unresponsive dialogue with options to wait or to quit the application. Could an arraylist by itself cause this problem I have capped the results at 90. p  pHere is snippets of the code AsyncTask portion putting the entries into a List      static Document doc  null      static final String baseHost  a hrefhttptestwebsite.com1api relnofollowhttptestwebsite.com1apia     private OnTaskCompleted listener p  precodeString sEIN   String sName   String sCity   String sState  All...

Negative 92815 pI often configure WordPress installations for lesstechnical people and find that the first important task is to remove unnecessary items from the admin panel, however this becomes increasinglydifficult to manage when plugins get enabled and the lockeddown users need access to its functions.p  pGenerally, I create a new Role from scratch using members plugin and disable things from there.p  pThe problem is that to allow a lockeddown user to access the settings for a plugin to emaddem an item to their admin menu I generally have to find the codeaddmenupagecode function and change the capability to one I know the lockeddown user will have which, while good for allowing users access based on capabilities, makes little sense when I just want to allow the Role access to the menu.p  pMore importantly, however, I dislike having to edit a plugins code particularly as it requires readjusting with each plugin update. Is there a cleaner way to achieve this or am I just approaching this issue in the wrong wayp

Any thoughts on how I could make this layout betterp  pThanksp  p[edit]p  pAdding the following diagram as to what this may look like. The gray lines can be ignored, just there to show where a JPanel might be. Each row is dynamically generated based on some user input.

Negative 92815 pI have looked for examples of where there is a simple date in a text field IPhone and a stepper next to the field to increment or decrement the date by one day but have not seen any examples or usage implementation.  So Im wondering if this goes against any Apple UI Human Interface Guidelines.p  pI am creating a business app that has many different date attributes to be stored with Core Data.  The user will supply date info in various sessions, typically within 04 days of the actual current date.  So my thinking is, throw up the view, put in the current system date, and let the user tap a stepper next to the date input field in question to increment the date updown by 1 day, formatting the text field accordingly to be saved propery.  Rather then having the user change the date via the keyboard or a datepicker subview  Any thoughts on why this is or is not a good idea in terms of UI or Apple guidelinesp

I was thinking something like this p  precodeclass base    virtual base getNextunsigned x  0   virtual void  getNextnoallocunsigned x, base alreadyallocatedderivedobject  0  codepre  pwhich will be overriden in the derived class like thisp  precodevoid getNextnoallocunsigned x, base alreadyallocatedderivedobject       constructimplx, this, alreadyallocatedderivedobject      codepre  pwhich unfortunately does not compile since there is no conversion from codebasecode to codederivedltDgtcode unless I use a staticcast. Is there any way to achieve what I need Thanks in advancep

When the user clicks new, the dialog pops up and allows the user to select who theyd like to message as of right now, its working with IDs rather than usernames.p  pWhen i open the dialog for the first time, everything works fine. Im able to select the recipient by either typing the ID or looking through it on a search form that opens on a second dialog. All of this works fine while opening for the first time before a page refresh. The ID field has an Ajax function on the onchange event that validates that the user ID exists on my database AND enables the send button disabled by default to prevent users from sending messages with a recipient ID of null.p  pThe problem is that, if i close the message dialog and reopen it without refreshing the page the Ajax functionality mentioned above doesnt work anymore.

I have 3 tabs on my index, one shows the unread messages, the other the read messages and the 3rd one the sent messages. Each tab lists the messages that fall in each category, and when i click one of the listed lines it opens a dialog showing the content. I realized that if, after opening and closing my new message dialog, if i open one of the listed messages under the unreadreadsent message and close that dialog, if i try opening the new message again, it works fine. And i can close itopen it as many times as i want and it works fine... S p

I am able to get the decrypted information provided I have WireShark running first and the 2 servers connect using a Full Handshake. WireShark cannot decrypt if the servers are using an Abbreivated Handshake.p  pAbbreviated Handshake is employing a technique called SSL Session Reuse, where the two servers store the encryptiondecryption information in a cache. This eliminates steps needed in a Full Handshake and saves CPU on future requests. I read that the default TTL for this cache is 10 hours, however I have not found where to set that. TLS by specification does a Full handshake when there is no information in either servers cache. After the Full Handshake, it automatically caches the info so it can then do the Abbreviated Handshake.p  pSince I am debugging, I have to run many scenarios many times.p  pI have found that the only way for me to ensure that the two servers do a Full Handshake is to reboot my server. This clears the cache and session information and the servers are forced to do a Full Handshake.p  pObviously, rebooting my server everytime I come back to testing this issue is not ideal. I did some research and found some articles that suggest I can disable the SSL Session Reuse by setting the registry key HKLMSYSTEMCurrentControlSetControlSecurityProvidersSCHANNELClientCacheTimeValue to 0.p  pa hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combhuizhuarchive20091217ssl2f00tlsfullhandshakevs.abbreviatedhandshake.aspx relnofollowhttpblogs.msdn.combhuizhuarchive20091217ssl2f00tlsfullhandshakevs.abbreviatedhandshake.aspxa a hrefhttpsupport.microsoft.comkb247658 relnofollowhttpsupport.microsoft.comkb247658ap  pThe articles suggest that this will disable the caching of the encryption information. However this has not worked for me. Am I missing somethingp  pIs there another way to disable SSL Session Reuse or a way to bust the cache without having to rebootp

I only should implement some changes based on proximitySensor. I am absolutely unable to enable proximityMonitoring I am doing the same thing as in other applications but it is simply not calling the notification and not changing proximityState. Biggest difference is that this applications appDelegate is .mm  mixed language, but I really dont think this should be a problem. p  pIs there some GLOBAL way to disable sensors or only proximity sensor Can some service for recording audio or playing audio be able to disable proximity sensor Any clue would be golden I really dont understand what could be preventing me from enabling this feature.

Some pages make a lot of ajax calls, other pages just have simple scripts.

Negative 92815 pHow to make such a thing happen so that the input box shows underscoreunderline right when you click the input box and then as you type the dashes keep getting replaced by characters.p  pLike in this case for a phone no. there was a 10digit underscoreunderline already there as I click on the input box and as I fill in the contact no. the characters replace the underscoreunderline.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com79Ec6.png altenter image description herep  pLike there is this Mobile input box, I want it to work in the following wayp  ul lipIt should show blank white when idle but when clicked it should show a ten character underscoresunderlinesdashes which depicts the 10digit phone no. is required to be filled in.p  pe.g. Mobile 910 strongememememememstrongpli lipThen, as I start typing in the dashes should start to get replaced by the numbers typed. Like if 2 numbersdigits are typed there should be 8 dashes following the 2 numbersdigits that were typed.p  pe.g. Mobile 910 98strongememememstrongpli lipAnd this should keep on going like 5 numbers down it should look like what followsp  pe.g. Mobile 910 99887strongememstrongpli ul  pand so on. As all the numbersdigits have been filled in the input box the dashes totally get replaced by the typed in numbers, which shows the user that all 10digits have been filled in and no number has been left out.p

Is there something else I need to do that Im missing when using this with SharePoint When utilizing an XSL style sheet for some transforms I had to deploy the xsl to the templates via my project utilizing the sharepoint mapped folder from within Visual Studio. Is something similar required for the winnovative dll to be utilized as well, so that the functions within the dll can be accessed  Do I need to do regsvr32 on the sharepoint server to utilize something that literally just occurred to me as Im writing this post, or is adding the reference in visual studio and compiling my code enough Sorry, not the worlds greatest developer, so some insight would be HUGELY appreciated.

Negative 92815 pMy app has a view controller where the user can add friends. The app accesses the users address book, and calls to the Parse.com backend server to see if any of the address book contacts are already using the app. If any are found, then I place the PFObjects for those users in the rows of my UITableView.p  pEach row in the table has a button. If the user presses a rows button, then the following code is executed which creates a PFRelation object called friendsRelation and adds the PFObject of the specific row that has been tappedp  precodePFRelation friendsRelation  [self.currentUser relationforKeyfriendsRelation]      PFUser user  [self.allUsersInParse objectAtIndexindexPath.row]      [friendsRelation addObjectuser]      [self.currentUser saveInBackgroundWithBlockBOOL succeeded, NSError error           iferror               NSLog , error, [error userInfo]           ] codepre  pThis all works great for the most part. If I check the current users row in Parse, and click on the View Relations button in their friendsRelation columnkey, it will display the correct users info that they just added.p  pHowever, if I go back to the main User class, and find the row for the friend that was added by the current user, and click on their View Relations button in their friendsRelation columnkey, it does not contain the user data for the current user that just added them.p  pSo basically if you add someone to your friends list, they will show up on your friends list just fine, but if your new friend goes and looks at their friends list, you wont be on there at all.p  pI tried creating a fix by adding additional PFRelation code for the user being added by the current user. See user2p  precode  PFRelation friendsRelation  [self.currentUser relationforKeyfriendsRelation]     PFUser user  [self.allUsersInParse objectAtIndexindexPath.row]     NSLogUSER CONTENTS ON BUTTON PRESS , user     [friendsRelation addObjectuser]      [self.currentUser saveInBackgroundWithBlockBOOL succeeded, NSError error           iferror               NSLog , error, [error userInfo]                 PFUser user2  [self.allUsersInParse objectAtIndexindexPath.row]       PFRelation friendsRelation2  [user2 relationforKeyfriendsRelation]       [friendsRelation2 addObjectself.currentUser]      [user2 saveInBackgroundWithBlockBOOL succeeded, NSError error2           iferror2               NSLog , error2, [error2 userInfo]                 ] codepre  pThis code is technically correct, but it is now allowed. Parse prints an error to the console and basically says that you are not allowed to add a PFRelation for a user that has not been authenticated via login or signup.p  pDoes anyone have any ideas on how I can make this workp  pThe only thing i have thought of is that when the added friend logs in to the app, I can query Parse for any friendsRelation objects in the database that contain their objectId, and if any are found then I can create a new PFRelation for the currently logged in user.p  pBut this will need to scan the entire database and seems like an inefficient fix that will be slow in the future as the database grows.p  pThanks for the help.p

Its due to the odd pointer incrementation, but I dont understand why this is a problem, as it seems to make sense.p  pI think it should increment the pointer, then dereference the unincremented pointer, then increment the value 10 to 11. So out  11, and the first value in the array is now 11. So this loop should print out 11, 21, 31, 1, then go on infinitely printing out values outside the array.

Negative 92815 pWhen I am compiling my code with C11 support using the codestdc11code flag and use nonheaderonly Boost libraries, then I need to have Boost compiled with codestdc11code.

Negative 92815 pI made a simple batch for XP that our team used to recreate XP profiles in a corporate environment but we have since moved to Win 7. Obviously recreating a User Profile in 7 is a little bit more complicated than simply renaming the old profile, dropping a Restore batch in the All Users startup folder and then letting Windows create a fresh profile on login. Writing a batch tends to get a little too complicated on the ifthenelse statements for me, so Im hoping to keep it simple like the old one. Someone suggested I incorporate a small commandline friendly user profile deletion utility into the batch, but I havent found any that first offers a backup. Which means Id have to Robocopy the entire user profile first, then restore all the data on login. Im hoping to avoid that time investment. It also makes me a bit nervous relying on no errors during the copying process before being all deleted on the next step. Which is why I really like the renaming of user profiles in XP for worst case scenarios. Can anyone point me in the direction of either a simple utility that does this, or can throw some quick and easy code together I might be able to use Most of my XP batch was just using c access, simple commands like p  precoderename ipcDocuments and SettingsUSERNAME USERNAME.date codepre  pAll your help is greatly appreciatedp

Negative 92815 pIm doing some animation with Canvas now, and will be preparing a system for the artists to use to make interactive animations. Ill be using my own timeline as the scenes will be created from some declarative nonjs input. My question is whats the right way to handle the per frame callback and time measurement In audio my realtime background, the rule is that there should be only only emoneem master callback method called by the audio system, and any other objects register with it somehow. And emallem time calculations are done by counting sample ticks of this callback so there is one and only one true clock source no asking the system clock for anything, just count samples. I assumed this is what I should do in my canvas app but Im seeing examples in books and sites where multiple objects use requestAnimationFrame, and then check the frame rate by using date objects to measure elapsed time. Am I off base in thinking one master callback is still the most elegant way to go And can I rely on measuring time in frame ticks assuming Im getting really 60fps if using requestAnimationFramep

Negative 92815 pI am currently working on a small project that involves using JDBC to hook into a small MySQL database. Its a small app that has multiple JTextFields and some JComboBoxes that can be used to add a new user to the database, update a user, delete a user and search for a user.p  pThe search should be able to be ran when the user presses the find button and will look to see which of the fields the user filled out and then build the query off of those fields. An example would be the user is searching for someone based on first and last namep  precodeString query  SELECT  FROM members WHERE firstName  ... and Surname  ... codepre  pThe firstName and Surname fields were appended when the program detected that the user had filled out those fields with data to be searched on.p  pMy problem is, I am trying to find an efficient way of being able to search off multiple criteria without ending up with an antipattern arrowhead.  Ex. I dont want my code to look likep  precodeif firstName.getText.length gt 0     dosomething     if lastName.getText.length gt 0           dosomething       if email.getText.length gt 0                 dosomething            codepre  petc...but so far this is the only way I can think of doing it, which will be monstrous due to the possible combination of search criteria. I was thinking of maybe doing a switch which emmightem help but I dont know what to base the switch off.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciatedp

Negative 92815 pI have an sql view V which has a 01 correspondence to a table X.  I would like to join this view onto another table, Y, which has a reference to X type XId. I have specified the view as I would any other table in persistent.  Vs id column is  a reference to X, but declaring the view as a table in persistent naturally gives it the type VId instead of XId.  And so I cant join the view onto Y because the types dont match up.p  pI realize I can do this with rawSQL, but my query also has an IN clause, which doesnt seem to play well with a list of values using rawSQL. Another option is to select the XId column twice in the view, and specify the extra one as having type XId in the model definition. Lastly I could fall back to inserting the view query inline or doing the query entirely with raw sql, skipping persistents interpolation.p  pIs there a way to do this without resorting to the methods above Id prefer to use esqueleto if possible. p

Negative 92815 pI am planning on developing an iOS app that uses the Google Calendar API.  Currently the dashboard shows that my App can use 200,000 Calendar requests per day.

If the App is successful we could easily exceed that limit...  p  pWhat is the policy for allocating my App a higher quota ifwhen I need it  Are quota increases always granted for serious usersproducts  Is there a pricing option that allows for unlimited requests  Or some other way to get guaranteed higher quota...  p  pId like to understand this before spending the time to build the App and distribute.

Negative 92815 pI have encountered an issue during the asynchronous execution Polling Method in a copy data process. The process was created by using the ODBC BCP APIs. I have created a simple test app to EXPORT and IMPORT data via the BCP utility. p  pThe program will export the data to a temporary file and then insert it back to the database. Eg, extract data from strongTestTablestrong to a temp file. Then, read the temp file and insert it back to strongTestTable2strong.

Negative 92815 pMorning All,p  pI am really hoping somebody can help me here.p  pI have a mechanism that downloads attachments from email messages sent into an inbox to a folder for processing by another service.p  pOriginally this was done using some VBA that was triggered by a rule in Outlook. This wasnt build with large amounts of information going in originally however it has got to the point now that lots of data is being passed through and it is causing me headaches using this Outlook VBA and SSIS Package combination.p  pTherefore I am working on a new version built entirely in VB .NET, this obviously will mean its more robust and a lot easier to debug problems.p  pI have started using the EWS API and have managed to successfully connect to the Exchange and I am able to read the relevant messages and store their Subject etc. to variables.p  pI am struggling however to find ANY documentation  help regarding downloading of attachements with EWS with VB .NET code.p  pEverything seems to be in C and I unfortunately have no experience with this. I am totally open to 3rd Party Solutions that may need to be purchased or even pointed in the right direction of a book or documentation, this is not being done on a shoe string and is quite important.p  pAny assistance in any way shape or form would be GREATLY appreciated.p  pCheers,p  pJamesp
Negative 92815 pI need to compare two char arrays as fast as possible and return which one is bigger. Normally I would use memcmp but unfortunately, theres only a pointer available for my tool pointing to the data stored in reverse order, or to the LSB in other words. Ive already read this question a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions8406148howtodoreversememcmpHow to do reverse memcmpa, but since it was asked in 2011 for c I was hoping that there has been some improvement since that time. Looking at the first answer here a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions21106801whyismemcmpsomuchfasterthanaforloopcheckWhy is memcmp so much faster than a for loop checka, there should be a direction flag which would solve my problem, but Ive no experience in embedding assembler code in c at all, so debugging or giving any support to others would be impossible for me.p  pIs there any builtin version of reverse memcmp which has been released since this question has been asked the first time Any suggestionsp

Negative 92815 pI am trying to set up automated Azure deployments for a Bamboo OnDemand build server but I ran into some troubles along the way.p  pThe errors Im getting are along the lines of the following post a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions26919157Deploy a Cloud Service using Powershell and Teamcity failsa. Unfortunately, downgrading the Azure PowerShell cmdlets to the September 2014 version did not help.p  pBamboo OnDemand uses Amazon EC2 elastic instances to perform the actual builds. They provide readymade virtual machines Windows Server 2008R2 which load a Bamboo elastic agent. The agent runs under a user called codebamboocode. By default, this user is emnotem a member of the administrators group. To cover all my bases I added the user to the administrators group, but, to no avail.p  pIn order to save costs, I have a script which boots up the build server at 7 AM and shuts it down at 8 PM.p  pI am using a PowerShell script which I initially found on a hrefhttpweblogs.asp.netsrkirklandcideploymentofazurewebrolesusingteamcity relnofollowScotts Bloga a hrefhttpsgist.github.comjnsn7dab1fbe99f1cf719097 relnofollowgista which I slightly modified to fit my needs. From my understanding, bamboo is executing the script using codeExecutionPolicy bypasscode but I already used codegpeditcode to allow PowerShell scripts to be run. However, I cannot find any relevant information to this in my build logs.p  pThe relevant parts arep  precodeImportModule Azure ImportAzurePublishSettingsFile PublishSettingsFile CToolsazure.publishsettings SetAzureSubscription CurrentStorageAccount service SubscriptionName subscription codepre  pFollowed by a function call to codePublishcode which in turn performs the following callp  precodedeployment  GetAzureDeployment ServiceName service Slot slot ErrorVariable a ErrorAction silentlycontinue  codepre  pWhen the codeImportAzurePublishSettingsFilecode call is present, I get the following errorp  precodeImportAzurePublishSettingsFile  An internal error occurred.

Negative 92815 pMy team is designing a set of COM objects that together implement a service. Currently, the design does not include a session object. By session object, I mean one that the client creates before using the service and deletes after using the service. I am trying to convince the team that we need such a session object in order to allow the client to control the allocation and deallocation of the services internal resources. Im looking for documented design patterns that help me make my case.p  pI know that many COM interfaces do not need such a session object. Any initialization of internal resources is done when the first object is created, regardless of what object that is, and those resources are released when the last object maintained by the server is deleted ie, when its reference count goes to 0. Although this is perhaps simpler for the client, the problem is that the cost of the initialization must be paid at the time the first object is created. If the client is expecting that to be a lightweight operation, and most of the time it is, this initialization results in unpredictable and undesirable behavior.p  pBy introducing a session object whose lifetime must wrap those of all other objects, the client can control when the initialization occurs and make sure that it occurs before the services managed by the session are used. I realize that a robust design requires that my service handle multiple sessions and that the initialization price be paid on creation of the first session object and releasing of resources on deletion of the last session object.p  pIs there a name for this pattern Are there any documented examples that I can point others to in order to support my case I realize that what I want to do is associated with RAII Resource Allocation Is Initialization but the motivation is a bit different.p

Negative 92815 pstrongQuestion has been updated to clarifystrongp  pFor simple arrays, I find it convenient to use codearr[key]code to either populate a new element or increment an existing element.  For example, counting the number of fruits, codearr[apple]code will create the array element codearrapplegt1code the first time apple is encountered.  Subsequent iterations will merely increment the value for apple.  There is no need to add code to check to see if the key apple already exists.p  pI am populating an array of arrays, and want to achieve a similar oneliner as in the example above in an element of the nested array.p  pcodestatscode is the array.

Negative 92815 pWe have a TeamCity CI server that needs to be able to execute Jasmine 1.3 and Jasmine 2.0 tests at different times, on different jobs.  It is using the TeamCity Karma integration.  My research so far is inconclusive, but it seems like Karma can only have one version of the Jasmine plugin at a time, so its an eitheror proposition.

Negative 92815 pIs there a Git command I can use that will list the names of all files that exist in one branch that do not exist in another branchp  pBackground Someone deleted some history and then pushed originmaster.

Now Id like to simply see what files exist in the new branch that do not exist at the HEAD of the master branch.

Negative 92815 pIm creating a simple interpreter in DelphiLazarus for a language similar to BASIC. I already achieved a lot of functionalities. At this moment, Im trying to create a DIM like command in order to handle multidimensional numeric arrays.

For example, when a declare in my interpreter a command like the followingp  pDIM numarr[3,3,3]p  pI would like to create a three dimensional array of double, with each index varying from 0 to 2.p  pSo far I have only the function to create the TList array. Im using two TList objects to keep the array dimensions and the data items list, I have a third one that holds the indexes for storeretrieve data. What I cant figure is how to associate a list of indexes to a specific entry in the TList. Its simple when the array is up to two dimensions, I can convert each pair of indexes to a numeric sequence, but no success to three and more dimensions. Is there any algorithm I could use to solve that Its really hard to find something related to that matter. Any suggestion about how to implement something similar is welcome.

Here is my codep  precodefunc getUsersFromFirebase          let registeredUserRef  firebaseRef.childByAppendingPathregisteredusers         registeredUserRef.queryOrderedByChildname.observeSingleEventOfType.Value, withBlock  snapshot in             if let email  snapshot.value[email] as String                  printlnsnapshot.key has Email email                          if let name  snapshot.value[name] as String                  printlnsnapshot.key has Name name                            codepre  pI noticed, that in the firebase guide, they always used the type ChildAdded and not Value, but for me Value makes more sense. The output with Value is nothing and the output with ChildAdded is only one user, namely the one that is logged in right now.p  pSo my questions arep  ol liCan I do this query with my current data structure or do I have to get rid of storying the users by their uidli liIf yes, how would I have to change my code, to make it workli liIf no, what would be the best way to store my users and make querying them by name possibleli liHow can I query for e.g. muster and get only the user simplelogin1 Max Mustermannli ol  pI hope my description is detailed enough. Thx in advance for your help.p  pstrongSupplementstrongp  pThe weird thing is, that the Retrieving Data guide says, that querying and sorting the following data by height is possible.p  pDatap  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com7ECuX.png altenter image description herep  pQuerying code img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com6rcxX.png altenter image description herep  pAnd isnt that exactly the same that I intent to dop

Negative 92815 pI think I have most of my code right. Im trying to take videos Uri from my SD card, change them to bitmaps and put it through codeThumbnailUtilscode as suggested here on Stack, like thisp  precodeUri uri  Uri.fromFilesingleFile  create thumbnail MINIKIND 512 x 384 thumbnail bitmapThumb  ThumbnailUtils.createVideoThumbnailuri.getPath,MediaStore.Video.Thumbnails.MINIKIND codepre  pThis code seems to be correct. Where it gets complicated is that Im using a model and an adapter, so go through a few steps. p  ol liPull the videos from my SD cardli liChange the codeUricode into a codeBitmapcode for the codeThumbnailUtilscode method.li liPut that bitmap into a new codeVideoGridItemcode objectli liAdd that object to my adapter.li liCall codegetVideocode in my adapter class which gets the bitmap from my model objectli liSet that bitmap to my codeImageViewcode in my adapterli ol  pThere might be something Im missing in these steps. I did a log on this codeBitmap bm  videoGridItem.getVideocode and oddly, codebmcode returns null. Which makes sense since I see nothing in the place where my video should be.p  pThe screenshot below, shows that the code did pull my 1 video from my SD card so my file IO is probably okay and filled the rest of the grid with placeholder images, but Im dont know why its not showing the video thumbnail. There is no crash or anything, just no thumbnail.

Negative 92815 pSuppose there are three threads A, B, and C. B and C suspend at a certain point, waiting for A to signal them to continue. Among the thread synchronization facilities provided by standard C, codestdconditionvariablecode seems to best fit in here though still bad. Since codestdconditionvariablecode must be used with a lock, the code for B and C may contain lines likep  precode   stdmutex mut   stduniquelockltstdmutexgt lockmut   condvar.waitlock   condvar is a global variable of type stdconditionvariable  codepre  pNote that codemutcode is used here not for synchronization purposes at all, but just to fit the signature of codestdconditionvariablewaitcode.

Negative 92815 pToday I noticed that offline speech recognition doesnt work anymore. It worked before because I was able to use it for my app and Im completely sure that I was offline and everything was working fine then. I wanted to test my app today and it couldnt understand what I said no matter how loud I said it.p  pThen I turned the wifi on and it was working perfectly. Im using the same phone though, sony xperia L, same OS, Android Jelly Bean 4.2.2. I have no idea what happened. Has Google changed something or what And its not just my app, other apps that need speech recognition wont work offline as well. Can someone explain this and tell me if there something I can do to get offline speech recognition again, or at least make it work for my appp  pThanks in advancep  pEDIT ive tested it on xperia z2 now and it has the same problem, so its not only my phone, i believe there was an update with some bugs from google, what do you think is it going to be fixed or do i have to fix it i want my app to work offlinep  pEDIT 2 i solved my problem by uninstalling all updates on Google App and getting back its factory version.p

Negative 92815 pCurrently Im working on a simple image editor where you can with a brush alter the alpha channel.p  pMy problem is, when a UIImageView with 0 or near zero alpha image is presented on another UIView, that has a dark color like brown, black, etc, a strange composition appears. Image becomes visible like its alpha has never been changed. When the back UIView is white, everything is normal.p  pYoull want to say keep it white but Im currently using this UIView as the background canvas and user has the ability to change the color.p  pThe captures I took are from Reveal, but the appearance is exactly the same on device as well. Here is what I mean with all this talkp  pThis is an image with 20 alpha set to all its pixels. The image looks ok. From Reveal, I can see that the image has the correct alpha channel. Everyting is as it should be.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comWv2OX.jpg altImage with alpha 20p  pHere is the same image with 15 alpha on a darker blue background sorry, while capturing I changed the alpha. From Reveal, everything is again looking normal.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.compsZ4N.jpg altBackground color changedp  pBut when you look at the device, this is what you see. This is the same UIImage with 15 alpha set to all pixels and presented in UIImageView.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comZNC0W.jpg altWhat is going on herep  pThe image is fully appearing on the background dark blue UIView, like its alpha is not 15. Changing alpha when working on a dark background has not much effect. It simply adds blue all over, or 100 alpha returns to the original image. Even when setting the alpha of all pixels to 0, the image is clearly visible.p  pIs there something Im missing Why this composition or blending of two UIView objects errorbugproblem appearing Is there a value that I am forgetting to set Or is this normal and am I doing something wrongp

Negative 92815 pFirst time posting here. Been reading for a bit, though. I am unable to find exactly what I need. Apologies in advance if I overlooked something.p  pI have an assignment where I need to create a random number generator that generates 6 random numbers between 1 and 59 for a lottery. The only part I am having trouble with is coming up with the code to check for and prevent duplicate numbers from appearing. I am only allowed to use loops and arrays in this, which is why I am having such a hard time. I know it should be easy, but I am a true beginner at JavaScript and am completely at a loss here.p  pWhat do I need to do to make sure duplicate numbers are not used in the output Again, I can only use loops and arrays, and everything is very basic.p  precodevar powerballLotteryRandom  var powerballRandom  function genRanPowerballNummin, max, num           var powerballArray  []          for var i  0 i lt num i               var ranNum  Math.random  max  min  min              powerballArray[i]  Math.roundranNum                    return powerballArray        powerballLotteryRandom  genRanPowerballNum1, 59, 5  powerballRandom  genRanPowerballNum1, 35, 1  if lotteryChoice  powerball       console.logYour Powerball lottery numbers are   powerballLotteryRandom  , and your Powerball number is   powerballRandom  . codepre  pWhat do I need to do, simply, to prevent duplicate numbers from showing up Again, I can only use loops and arrays, I must use functions, and it should be kept very basic, if that makes sense.p  pHopefully I posted all of the code you might need. The generator actually firsts prompts users to enter whether they would like state or Powerball lottery numbers and then runs code according to what they picked. I would be happy to post more code if it is needed.p  pThanks for any help Melonyp

Negative 92815 pIm having a bit of trouble with a specific implementation of testing out my Web.API methods using RestSharp.  I have been very successful in performing POSTS and GETS in my open nonsecured methods.  However, when I have to send in a token to determine access I have problems.p  pHere is the implementationp  pI am using OWIN middleware for my Web.API.  The client must post to a token service in order to get the given Token that contains their claims.  All of this has been working fine.p  pIn my test my Initializer has the following code that posts to the token service and gets back the token.

As you can see, normally, when the service is called the ValidityChecker will receive an HttpActionContext.  Along with that, the RequestContext.Principal of that HttpActionContext will normally be of type ClaimsPrincipal.  p  pHowever, when running from a unit test and using RestSharp it is, of course, a WindowsPrincipal.p  pIs there a way using RestSharp to make that a ClaimsPrincipal  Ive tried to ensure the token is included in the header using the Authorization parameter, but have not had any luck.p

But now Im wondering why theyre created when code.pycode files are importedp  pAlso, why not create a code.pyccode file for the main Python file doing the importingp  pIm guessing it has to do with performance optimization and learning this has encouraged me to break out my files since the builtin compilation seems nice to take advantage of.

Negative 92815 pI am trying to create Linq to SQL expressions to generically allow for the same properties to be compared on two different domain entity records.

Negative 92815 pProject Backgroundp  pFirst off I have very basic knowledge about Android development, and Im currently performing practice assignments that have been designed to essentially give me a crash course in Android development.  Per the assignment specs weve been asked to make full use of the benefits of StackOverflow in coming up with solutions to our tasks. In my applications current state, there is a LoginActivity and a MainActivity, the main activity contains 5 fragments that can be accessed via the MenuItem bar across the top of the MainActivity. Upon pressing any tab, current fragments are removed if there are any  and per this logic there is never more than one nonheadless fragment open at a time and the new fragment is added to the codeMainActivitycode container view. Everything is pretty typical as far as I know and fragments are created using the codenewInstancecode format. The fragment that I need to deal with in this iteration of my tasks is my codeMessageFragmentcode which will contain a coderefreshcode button and codeTextViewcode that will publish the results of the refresh.p  pMy Taskp  pPer this assignment I am tasked with creating a retained fragment that will run a thread with codeHandlercode. The purpose of this practice scenario is to simulate content refreshes that occur when connecting to the web. For the practice scenario I am to create a runnable task that will be enqueued onto a thread that will return its result all the way to the codeMessageFragmentcode. The result should be a random number displayed in the codeTextViewcode. I am to pause the thread for 5 seconds before producing the result. Ive been told to keep in mind that in order to see the result after screen rotations you need to refresh the message fragment by quickly choosing some other tab and then returning to the message tab.p  pKey detailsp  ul liMust use codeHandlercodecodeLoopercodecodeThreadcode approach to perform the simulation of networked content refreshli liMust have seamless orientation change handlingli liIMPORTANT Once implementing basic functions, we are to fix the refresh button making it so that it isnt necessary to change tabs after orientation changes li ul  pMy questionsp  ul liWhy is it necessary to quickly choose some other tab then return after screen rotationsli liHow can I fix this issueli liWhat would be a general outline to performing these the tasks mentioned aboveli ul

Negative 92815 pI am building a simple Audio Player app using Swift. I have two View Controllers in my Storyboard. The second View Controller creates an instance of the AVAudioPlayer and is used to play audio. I want the user to be able to navigate away from that view controller, use other features in the app and go back to that view controller to manipulate the player.p  pThe problem is that when I play some audio, navigate away and then go back to the players View Controller and press play again, two versions of the audio file are played at the same time.p  pIm guessing that it is creating a new instance of the AVAudioPlayer object, rather than manipulating the one I made first.
