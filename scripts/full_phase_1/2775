Positive 2775 pIm interested what is the proper manner to construct object with dependencies which themselves have Assisted params. An example will better illustratep  pOrdinarilly with dependencies that do not have codeAssistedcode params you can simply have a complex heirarchy of objects which all have their dependencies and these get injected no problem, I can just get an instance of an object and all its dependencies will be generated and injected without me having to do anything.p  pBut if I wanted to change it so some of the dependencies in the object hierarchy have codeAssistedcode params then I have to create those instances myself using a factory iep  precodepublic SomeConcreteServiceAssisted String string      this.string  string   MyFactory myFactory  injector.getInstanceMyFactory .class SomeService myService  factory.getMyServicesome string codepre  pThis would cause problems for the clean instantiation of the objects because I would have to manually create those instances. and pass them into the required object, which essentially renders the DI for that object redundant I think ie I would then need to use the codenewcode keyword and pass in all dependencies manually...p  precodenew MyComplexObjectmyService, myOtherService codepre  pHow do I make it so that I dont have to manually build the object graph if one or more of the dependencies uses codeAssistedcode parametersp
Positive 2775 pIve been reading through the Docker documentation and cant seem to work out if its possible to create a custom commanddirective. Basically I need to make an HTTP request to external service to retrieve some assets that need to be included within my container. Rather than referencing them using Volumes I want to effectively inject them into the container during the build process, a bit like dependancy injection.p
Positive 2775 pIn my controllers, all dependencies are received through injection, following the a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiDependencyinversionprinciple relnofollowDependency inversion principlea, except for one, the Mapper class, which is instantiated by the constructorp  pre classlangc prettyprintoverridecodepublic class HomeController  Controller      private readonly ISomeAppService SomeAppService     private readonly Mapper Mapper      public HomeControllerISomeAppService someAppService              SomeAppService  someAppService         Mapper  new Mapper           public ActionResult Index              var someList  SomeAppService.GetSomeList         var someListDTO  Mapper.MapsomeList         return Viewnew HomeIndexViewModelsomeListDTO      codepre  pThe codeSomeAppServicecode is an Application Layers Service in front of my Domain Layer. The Mapper receives domain objects and returns DTOs to be used by the view.p  pMy reasoning is that since a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11064316whatisviewmodelinmvcViewModel represents only the data that you want to display on your viewpagea, I cant foresee any situation where I would need to replace a Mapper with something else, or how this could be bad for testing. I also cant see this Mapper class being reused on any other Presentation Layer, since other views can be different from the Web presentation. To me it feels as a part of the Controller.p  pThe question is, is this correct Do I need to receive the Mapper through dependency injection Do I need to define an interface for it And if so, for what reasons I want to adhere to SOLID principles, but I want to know if and how they apply here.p

Positive 2775 pThere is a module I would like to test. This module writes files to disk using fs.writeFile and fs.mkdir.p  pI would like the module to not actually write anything during the test to avoid cluttering the filesystem but I would like to make sure fs.writeFile and fs.mkdir are called with the right arguments so that when the code runs in production, the right files are written where I intended them to be.p  pI got away with using rewirep  precodevar rewire  requirerewire var Module  rewire..libmodule  var mkdirpath var fsMock     mkdir functionpath, cb      mkdirpath  path     return cbnull     var revert  Module.setfs.mkdir, fsMock.mkdir  Module.funcfunctionerr    assert.equalmkdirpath, expectedpath   revert  codepre  pThis is fine for such a simple example. When there are several calls to fs.mkdir, then I have to use a ton of logic in fsMock.mkdir to make sure that I am only saving mkdirpath for the fs.mkdir call that I want to verify. It turns very ugly and illegible fast.p  pI have found a way to do it with a sinon stubp  precodevar Module  require..libmodule var sinon  requiresinon var fs  requirefs var stub  sinon.stubfs, mkdir, functionpath, cb  return cbnull   Module.funcfunctionerr    assert.equalstub.calledWithexpectedpath, true   fs.mkdir.restore  codepre  pThis still has the issue of requiring a ton of extra logic to make sure I am processing the right fs.mkdir call. Worst, it overrides fs.mkdir globally and forces me to require fs in my test even though I dont need it in my test. If gulp tries to use fs.mkdir before I called restore, then the stub is used. It doesnt feel like an elegant solution.p  pIs there an elegant way to test this kind of code Should I wrap fs.mkdir in a private Module.mkdir method and stub this one out instead of fs.mkdir so I can still assert it was called with the right path, but only globally stub a method that is used by my module onlyp  pedit A third option would be to not mock any of the fs methods and just look at the resulting directories and files once Module.func has run. This could work if I had a good way of keeping track of the files generated and cleaning them up after every test. p  pThat would avoid part of the problem but what do you do if the files written are large and it slows down your test suite And how do you keep track of what files are written without too much overhead Or what if your dependency isnt fs but S3p
Positive 2775 pIm the process of cleaning up some code. I have decided to do this because it is very likely that new features will be requested in the near future and the code is hard to grok not only because it uses a dependency container as a service locator.p  pTo a fair extent, I understand why SL is terrible for dependency management and Ive declared all dependencies of a method in the operations signature even before I knew what OOP is.p  pWhen working with frameworks like AngularJS, you get dependency injection for free. This is not the case with my current project. The only way I can think of instantiating the application the right way is by servicelocating everything in the main method. Please point me in the right direction toward a more elegant implementation of dependency injection.p  pThis is my current approachp  precodefunction main     container  new Dic     containergtsetA, lazyNewfoobarA     containergtsetB, lazyNewA, dependson[A]     containergtsetApp, lazyNewApp, dependson[A, B]      more configuration code     app  containergtgetApp     app.main codepre  pThe flaw here is that Im still using the container as a service locator. The only benefit is that the dependency graph is resolved automatically tedious configuration and declaration of dependencies for every instance. Another pro is that instantiation happens in one place. Please help me understand how to take this to the next level of awesome.p

Positive 2775 pIm using Simple Injector with an ASP.NET Web API project, and I want to use different implementations for one interface, depending on the version of REST endpoint used. For example, if v1 of an endpoint is used, codeIPaymentDatacode should be instantiated with a class called codePaymentDatacode, but if v2 is used codeIPaymentDatacode should be implemented by a class called codePaymentDataNewcode. This is turning out to be problematicp  pI dont want to use a composite class like a part of Simple Injector documentation suggests since that means that my code needs to be aware of and take into account the injection framework Im using bad.p  pI noticed in the latest version 3.0 that something called a hrefhttpssimpleinjector.readthedocs.orgenlatestadvanced.htmlcontextbasedinjection relnofollowContext based injectiona is a feature.

Positive 2775 pI have a service that needs to return a code each time method codeGetNextcode is called. For that, I have several code providers implementing an interface. The same code provider should be used between ServiceHost opening and closing, and so for each service call. I would like to avoid creating one instance of the code provider at each call.p  pI already looked at several posts, in particular dependency injection for WCF services mostly Mark Seemanns answers, where solutions using IInstanceProvider and ServiceHostFactory allow to pass parameters during service construction. Perhaps I did not fully understood what was happening there, as I have no extended knowledge of WCF. I ended up implementing a static factory and using it in the service implementation as followsp  precode[ServiceBehaviorConcurrencyMode  ConcurrencyMode.Single,                  InstanceContextMode  InstanceContextMode.PerCall] public class CodeService  ICodeService      public string GetNext              return CodeProviderFactory.GetCodeProvider.GetNextCode       codepre  pIf needed, I could extend this by passing the type of code required to the factory, getting it from configuration DB or file, but that is not the point. Is this the best way to have one single instance of the code provider, and if not, what would be the correct i.e. more elegant, performant and maintainable solution Also is the concern of having a single instance of the code provider legitimatep

Positive 2775 pI have a project organized in a way similar to below in Android studiop  ul licodelibcommonscodeli licodemoduleauthcodeli licodeappdemocodeli ul  pcodelibcommonscode and codemoduleauthcode are basically Android library projects.  codemoduleauthcode is meant to be an independent, pluggable module to be attached to a couple of apps in the project. It contains an activity and a couple of fragments with injectable fields. Since Android would be in charge of managing these activitiesampfragments, I would have to inject the fields manually, something like codedaggerComponent.injectthiscode in the activityp  pThe application component, as well as other relevant modules currently reside in the various apps in the project e.g appdemo, all to be instantiated by an Application subclass in the corresponding app. This means I wont have access to the application component from codemoduleauthcode, as a result, making injection impossible. I have tried moving the dagger component to commons, but that would require it having a knowledge of all possible injection points, which would  be impossible since commons generally has no idea of the existence of any of these apps.p  h3The questionh3  pWhat is a possible clean approach to organise the project such that I can access the application component from this module Keeping in mind that the component would actually be instantiated in the codeappdemocodes Application objectp  pIn dagger 1, I could easily place the object graph in commons, and call codegraph.injectthiscode from any registered class in the project. I would only have to load corresponding dagger modules separately for each app. I could create an abstract Application in commons containing an abstract codegetModulescode method which would then be implemented in the apps. However the object graph is still the same one, and injection is pretty straight forward.p  pHow do I acheive this in dagger 2p  pKindly advise. Thanks.p

However, the required graph looks a little different for each of the file format versions illustrative example, not the actual types the real graphs are much more complexp  pVersion 1p  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodeReadDataFileContents  IReadDataFileContents gt ReadCoreData  IReadCoreData gt ReadAdditionalData  IReadAdditionalData    gt NormalizeName  INormalizeName codepre  pVersion 2p  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodeReadDataFileContentsV2  IReadDataFileContents gt ReadCoreData  IReadCoreData gt ReadAdditionalDataV2  IReadAdditionalData    gt NormalizeNameV2  INormalizeName       gt AdditionalNameRegex  IAdditionalNameRegex codepre  pVersion 3p  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodeReadDataFileContentsV2  IReadDataFileContents gt ReadCoreData  IReadCoreData gt ReadAdditionalDataV3  IReadAdditionalData    gt NormalizeNameV2  INormalizeName       gt AdditionalNameRegexV3  IAdditionalNameRegex codepre  pIm only considering entirely separate graphs like this handling this in a single graph and switching every time there is a versionrelated difference obviously gets really messy very quickly.p  pNow whenever the codeIReadDataFile.Fromcode method is called to load a file, it needs to get hold of the appropriate subgraph for the file format version. An easy way to achieve this is via an injected factory p  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodepublic class ReadDataFile  IReadDataFile      private readonly IGetDataFileVersion getDataFileVersion     private readonly Funcltint, IReadDataFileContentsgt createReadDataFileContents      public ReadDataFile         IGetDataFileVersion getDataFileVersion,         Funcltint, IReadDataFileContentsgt createReadDataFileContents              this.getDataFileVersion  getDataFileVersion         this.createReadDataFileContents  createReadDataFileContents           public Scenario Fromstring fileName              var version  this.getDataFileVersion.FromfileName         var readDataFileContents  this.createReadDataFileContentsversion         return readDataFileContents.FromfileName       codepre  pThe question is how registration and resolution of those subgraphs will work.p  pRegistering the complete subgraphs as codeKeyedltTgtcode by hand is very involved and errorprone and does not scale well for additional file format versions especially as the graphs are a lot more complex than the example.p  pInstead, I would like the registration for the whole thing as described above to look like thisp  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodebuilder.RegisterAssemblyTypestypeofIReadDataFile.Assembly.AsImplementedInterfaces  builder.RegisterTypeltReadDataFileContentsgt.AsltIReadDataFileContentsgt builder.RegisterTypeltReadDataFileContentsV2gt.KeyedltIReadDataFileContentsgt2  builder.RegisterTypeltReadAdditionalDatagt.AsltIReadAdditionalDatagt builder.RegisterTypeltReadAdditionalDataV2gt.KeyedltIReadAdditionalDatagt2 builder.RegisterTypeltReadAdditionalDataV3gt.KeyedltIReadAdditionalDatagt3  builder.RegisterTypeltNormalizeNamegt.AsltINormalizeNamegt builder.RegisterTypeltNormalizeNameV2gt.KeyedltINormalizeNamegt2  builder.RegisterTypeltAdditionalNameRegexgt.AsltIAdditionalNameRegexgt builder.RegisterTypeltAdditionalNameRegexV3gt.KeyedltIAdditionalNameRegexgt3  builder.RegisterltFuncltint, IReadDataFileContentsgtgtc gt      var context  c.ResolveltIComponentContextgt      return version gt  magic happens here  codepre  pThat means there are only explicit registrations for the components that vary between the graphs. And by magic happens here, I mean that for getting away with this minimum in registrations, the resolution will have to do the heavy lifting.p  pThe way I would like this to work is this For each component in this subgraph to be resolved, it is attempted to resolve a registration keyed to the requested file format version. If that attempt fails, another one is made for the next lower version, and so forth when the resolution for key code2code fails, the default registration is resolved.p  pA complete examplep  ul liThe codecreateReadDataFileContentscode factory is called with a codeversioncode value of code3code, so the required graph is the one for file format version 3 given above.li liAn attempt is made to resolve codeIReadDataFileContentscode with the key code3code. This is unsuccessful there is no such registration.li liNow an attempt is made to resolve codeIReadDataFileContentscode with the key code2code. This succeeds.li liThe constructor requires an codeIReadCoreDatacode. It is attempted to resolve this with the key code3code, then code2code both fail, so the default registration is resolved, which succeeds.li liThe second constructor parameter is codeIReadAdditionalDatacode it is attempted to resolve this with the key code3code, which succeeds.li liThe constructor requires codeINormalizeNamecode resolution with key code3code fails, then the attempt for code2code succeeds.li liThis constructor in turn requires codeIAdditionalNameRegexcode the resolution attempt with key code3code succeeds.li ul  pThe tricky thing here and the one I cant figure out how to do is that the version countdown fallback process needs to happen for strongeachstrong individual dependency to be resolved, each time starting from the initial value of codeversioncode.p  pPoking around the Autofac API and a bit of googling yielded a few things that looked interesting, but none of them seemed to offer an obvious path to a solution.p  ul licodeModule.AttachToComponentRegistrationcode  I have used this elsewhere to hook into the resolution process using the coderegistration.Preparingcode however, that event is only raised when a suitable registration has been found, and there doesnt appear to be an event that is raised before that, nor a way to register a callback in case of resolution failure which surprises me.li licodeIRegistrationSourcecode  This seems to be the way to implement such more general registrationresolution principles, but I cant get my head around what Id need to do inside that, in case that is actually the place Im looking for.li licodeWithKeyAttributecode  We cant use this here, because we need to control the version of a dependency that is injected from the outside also, the actual business code would become dependent on Autofac, which is never good.li licodeILifetimeScope.ResolveOperationBeginningcode  This looked very promising, but the event is only raised for resolutions that have already been successful.li licodeIIndexltTKey, TValuegtcode  Another thing that looked really good at first, but it contains already constructed instances, which leaves no way to get the version key to the resolution for the lower levels.li ul  pA problem to solve on the side would be restricting the whole thing to just the types that are actually relevant for this, but I guess that could be done convention based namespace etc. if need be.p  pAnother thought that might help is that after all the registrations are made which would have to be determined somehow, the gaps could be filled up  meaning if there is a registration keyed with 3 but none with 2, one will be added that is equal to the default registration. That would allow resolving emallem dependencies in the subgraph with the same key and do away with the need for that cascaded fallback mechanism which may be the most difficult part of the whole thing.p  pIs there any way this can be achieved with Autofacp  pAlso, thanks for reading this epic in the first placep

Positive 2775 pIm using CastleWindsor as my dependency injection framework and it all works well when youre in a Controller, because we can make use of constructor injection with the controllerfactory. p  pBut there are some specific cases that dependency injection  constructor injection  would not work.. For example I want to be able to resolve my dependencies still with IOC in some utility classes or extension methods  eg. of HtmlHelper  in my Views. I know that some people wouldnt agree on that and rather keep the views dumb, but lets keep that out the discussion. p  pSo this basically leaves me with one option and thats using... the service locator. So I know that the Service Locator is considered by emmostem people as an anti pattern and I do understand why.. But how do you resolve your dependencies with IOC if you cant use dependency injection For all that I know is that  its still better to use the service locator for IOC than having nothing. I would like to avoid the service locator pattern, but I do not seem to understand how to avoid it in some specific cases.p  pNext question is.. so even if you likedislike the service locator. Which is the best option to implement this with CastleWindsor p  pSo I guess the options would be 1 Expose the container as a global object  or through some other global object that wraps the container  that you can retrieve from anywhere in your code. You can then just call the resolve and release methods on the container. One thing I dont like about this is, that we have to call release explicitly for transient lifestyle objects. If an inexperience developer does not do this, youd end up having a memory leak. p  p2 I also found a hrefhttpswww.nuget.orgpackagesCommonServiceLocator.WindsorAdapter relnofollowhttpswww.nuget.orgpackagesCommonServiceLocator.WindsorAdaptera and it has a lot of downloads..  Same principal as option 1 but more generic and wraps the container so you can swap the DI framework easily  I looked into the code and I found out that the adapter only has methods to resolve objects. So I kinda wondered why theres no release method.. Does this mean this package has memory leak problems with transient lifestyle objectsp  pHope somebody can give me some advice on these matters p

Its not perfect, but it works.p  pFrom this, we need to be able to derive a plaintext alternative for the email. I was thinking of instantly jumping on and creating a RegEx to strip the codeltgtcode tags from the message  but then I realised strongthis would be no good because we do need some of the formatting information paragraphs, line breaks, images etc.strongp  pstrongNOTEstrong I am OK with actually sending the mail and setting up alternative views etc, this is strongonly about getting plaintext from HTML.strongp  pSo, I am pondering some ideas. Will post one as an answer to see what you guys think, but thought I would open it up to the floor. p  pIf you need any more clarification then please shout.p  pMany thanks,p  pRobp
Negative 2775 pIm not sure if my questions title is clear enough but Ill try my best to explain.p  pI really am not sure about how PHP executes the function codemysqlquerycode in terms of retrieval and storage of strings.

Negative 2775 pYesterday I got a call from a Microsoft representative asking if we supply hosted solutions, presumably as part of the big Windows Azure push. As soon as I got off that call, our marketing director came into my office and said the majority of our customers are demanding Active Directory integration in the next version. Then it occurred to me how does one use Active Directory in a hosted solution if the application does not live on the customers networkp  pAs a more general question about Active Directory integration, what kind of functional changes does that usually imply for an app Does it mean a user is signed into the app just by authenticating to Active Directory or does it mean the app gets its list of users from Active Directory or does the creation of new users or groups in the app create new users or groups in Active Directoryp  pAm I just caught in the crossfire of a war of buzzwordsp

Negative 2775 pWhat options exist for creating a scalable, full text search with results that need to be sorted on a per user basis This is for PHPMySQL SymfonyDoctrine as well, if relevant.p  pIn our case, we have a database of workouts that have been performed by users. The workouts that the user has done before should appear at the top of the results. The more frequently theyve done the workout, the higher it should appear in search matches. If it helps, you can assume we know the number of times a user has done a workout in advance.p  pstrongPossible Solutionsstrongp  pstrongSphinxstrong  Use Sphinx to implement full text search, do all the querying and sorting in MySQL. This seems promising and theres a Symfony Plugin but I dont know much about it.p  pstrongLucenestrong  Use Lucene to perform full text search and put the users completions into the query. As is suggested in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1349419lucenesearchresultssortbycustomorderlistuniquetoeachuser13494961349496this Stack Overflow threada. Alternatively, use Lucene to retrieve the results, then reorder them in PHP. However, both solutions seem clunky and potentially unscalable as a user may have completed hundreds of workouts.p  pstrongMysqlstrong  No native full text support InnoDB, so wed have use LIKE or REGEX, which isnt scalable.p

Negative 2775 pI have an application that, as any other app, crashes once in a while for various reasons.p  pWhen it crashes, it does it gracefully and the users get a nice message of the crash. At the same time the crash is reported on the server for analysis so it can be fixed in future versions. However, I would like that the app keeps working through the crash.p  pWhat that means is that I would like to run the forms in an atomic way. If it goes down, it doesnt take down the entire app. The users should just need to start over the work done with the particular form.p  pIs this something that can be done through architecture Or maybe the new framework versions has something to aid thisp  pThe application is build mostly in C over the 3.5 framework, but it also uses some external references, some COMs and web service references.p  pI am not interested in an answer well fix the crashes.

Negative 2775 pIm predominately a Java guy, which is why I need some assistance on what I assume is rather simple to do in PHP and rather simple with Java too, although perhaps a bit... verbose.p  pSimply put, I want to construct a webpage which has a list of string items that users have added. At the bottom of the page would be a place in which a user could type Hello World in a box for instance and hit a submit button, adding it to the list of items. Adding to the top or the bottom of the list is irrelevant  I can probably tweak that later.p  pIm the kind of guy who doesnt just like answers, but at the same time I have emnoem idea where to even start searching. Ive done no PHP development before. What sorts of constructs or functions should I be looking at I own the physical box itll be running on its literally right next to me now so permissions arent a restriction, and neither is getting anything else that might help the situation although I cant see how it would be needed for such a simple script. What sorts of input validation should I be really wary of This service will be restricted to people who have be given access to a particular section of an apachebased website, so they have to log in to even see this planned page, but Id like to cover all possibilities.p  pAdditionally, I would perhaps like output to look likep  pBlockquote Hello World added by user User1p  pThis is an additional line added by User2p  pGoodbye World added by user User1 Blockquote in the future. What should I be looking at to do thisp  hr  pUpdate to answer questionsp  pWhen it comes to storage of the actual content, Id be leaning towards a simple file holding each entry line by line, as Col. Shrapnel suggested. A think a database would be overkill, although I do have the wherewithal to implement it. If a user submits Hello World then adding a line to a file that says p  pBlockquoteHello World posted by User1Blockquotep  pis sufficient.p  pWith regards to authentication, this is already set up in apaches codehttpd.confcode configuration file. Currently this allows access to a certain group of users through an codeAuthGroupFilecode entry. This is where the script will be hosted. To access this script, users will have already authenticated themselves with their credentials. The authentication currently works for that section of the site. Really, this is a emsecondaryem concern of mine. It is enough that lines are simply added with no record of who said what. This is just sugar on the PHP cake if it can be done easily with what I already have implemented.p

If codeicode is relatively small close to 0 or large close to codencode, then one of the windows may not fit in the array.

I dont want to touch this old Backend system as its crafted over the past Decade. So my Idea is to start the codecmd.execode Programm and execute the Bash script in there. For this I will use the system function in .Net. p  pBut I also need to read the Batch script commandline Output back into my C Program. I could redirect it into a file. But there has to be a way to get the Standard Output from codeCMD.execode in into my C Program.p  pThank you very muchp

Negative 2775 pIm developing a mobile Flash application not an AIR app running in the browser. According to Adobep  blockquote   pFlash Player 10.1 provides support for   use of native device virtual keyboards   with TextField support if no physical   keyboard is detected. A virtual   keyboard is automatically raised and   lowered in response to focus changes   on text fields when editing text on   mobile devices supporting a virtual   keyboard to enable unobstructed and   intuitive text editing. The focused   text field is centered in the visible   region of the page and appropriately   zoomedscrolled to ensure it is not   obscured by the virtual keyboard. Upon   screen rotation, incoming calls, or   other system events, any already   existing text input is retained.

Negative 2775 pThis is more of a theoretical question rather than language specific, but Im mostly referring to AS3.p  pLets say I have an app that shows buttons through a couple of levels of navigation.p  pFor example codeartistsAlphabeticalgtalbumsgtsongscode or codesongsAlphabeticalgtsongcode or codealbumsAlphabeticalgtalbumgtsongcodep  pso wed set up a modelData with all the songs the lowest common denominator  it would have the artistalbumyear etc. info within the song objectp  pLets say we dont have a dataset for the albums and need to extract that from songs. or we do have a datasaet and need to match them up.p  pstrongWhere should that fall under Model or Controllerstrongp  pI can find reasons for either, but am wondering what the correcter way would be.p  pNext we have the View with all the buttons to do the sorting.p  pWhen you click on the sort button emArtistsAem   thats the View sending a message to the Controller to do something emget alphabetical list of artists that start with Aem. The end result should be a new paginated view if necessary with buttons for each artist.p  pWhich part of MVC should be responsible for each stepp  pstrongGenerating a list of artists that start with Astrongp  pwould it be the controller that says  Hey model  Artists that start with A NOWp  por, would it be more like Model  send me a list of all the Artists, I need to find the Adawgsp  pessentially should the model do the sorting and cache it if possibleneeded or should the logic be under the Controller, and the Model can store the cachep  pSo once we have a list of the artists, we need to create a button for all the ones that fit on the screen plus some previousnext buttons. Who should be creating the Buttonsp  pstrongShould there be a View Controller A SubController that only deals with the logic needed to create the views Or would the logic be part of the Viewstrong It seems to me that the apps Controller would be all like not in my job description... I gave you the list you needed rest is up to youp  pI feel like Im conflicted between two views of MVC, one strongmvCstrong  where the Controller is working like a motherlicker, and the Model is a glorified data holder and the view manages DisplayObjects. Or an strongMVcstrong where the controller is the managerdelegator that makes sure that the Model and the View communicate properly, so that the model and view would have a fair amount of logic, and the controller would handle communication and delegate top level interaction.p  pWhile I am doing most of my stuff in AS3, I am curious how other languages would handle this. For example, in PHP Frameworks, you wouldnt need to worry about the button logic and event handling as much as with as3, where you need to watch Garbage collection, so the workload of one component there might be different than in a Cinder, processing or actionscript app.p

Negative 2775 pFirst time posting here after having great results searching for other answers on stackoverflow. Ive hit a roadblock in an app Im trying to build. It involves plotting a graph with JS using dynamic values pulled from a database. p  pIm at the point now where I have all the values I need to plot a graph using a javascript library.

With that data, you could call the function like sop  precode.plotplaceholder, [ plot1 ] codepre  pThis does all the work for you and builds a nice little graph. In my case I do all of this dynamically. Heres where Im stuck. I have an array that outputs this when printedp  precodeArray       [0] gt var test7  [[1, 1]]      [1] gt var test2  [[1, 1]]      [2] gt var test2  [[4, 1]]      [3] gt var test2  [[15, 2]]      [4] gt var test1  [[2, 1]]      [5] gt var test1  [[6, 7]]      [6] gt var test1  [[14, 1]]      [7] gt var test1  [[15, 1]]      [8] gt var giver  [[3, 2]]      [9] gt var giver  [[14, 1]]      [10] gt var test4  [[4, 1]]   codepre  pWhat I need to do now, is group all of the values that contain the same linkId test2 has 3 instances for example together into one line. Heres what I need the array to look likep  precodeArray       [0] gt var test7  [[1, 1]]      [1] gt var test2  [ [1, 1], [4, 1], [15, 2] ]      [4] gt var test1  [ [2, 1], [6, 7], [14, 1], [15, 1] ]      [8] gt var giver  [ [3, 2], [14, 1] ]      [10] gt var test4  [[4, 1]]   codepre  pFrom that point I can run a foreach on it an echo out the values inside a script tag, and were up and runningp  pSuggestions I know there isnt going to be a single built in function that accomplishes everything I need in one quick swoop. arrayunique is close but not quite what I need. I think I can use arraywalkarray, callback which accepts an array and a callback function that is executed on each value within the array, but Im really not sure where to go from there. p  pAny help is greatly appreciatedp

Negative 2775 pThanks William, that was the ticket. Had to assign the name property on both ends [DataTable.TableName].p  pOn a side note here There appears to be some school of thought no offense Marc that the following statement is always truep  pEverything in the world can and should be made into an object.p  pIt is, simply, not always true. There are cases where you cannot cram your object into any cookiecutter or class no matter how you try to customize it. For me to objectize this beast, Id have to create roughly 4,000 objects. I dont have time to do that, and yet this project emmustem run as a service. Frankly I think the developers at MickeySoft need to get out more into the real world, and see for themselves that although theory is great it does not represent truelife challenges. I am all for working with objects for the obvious benefits, but there is a reality that universals do not exist. In my trade, even most of the time rarely happens.p  pBefore they push out a new technology set, and cease support of an old one, they need to make sure that the new technology has the same capabilities the old one had.p  pFor the record The people who believe the above statement to be true are also the same people who would refuse to take the project Im currently working on.p  pJust the same  thank you both for your time, efforts and opinionsp  pIm trying to create a WCF function that will return a table to my console testing app. I am a total noob.

Negative 2775 pIm working in Rails3 and I would like to render a partial depending on a specific datetime.  For example, on Christmas I want to show the Christmas content, on Halloween the Halloween content, etc.  It would be great if the partials were stored in a datastore somewhere and called out depending on some metadata.p  pI can do this in a onebyone type of way but I wanted to know if anyone knew of a Gem that may already do something like this.  Im fairly certain that Im not the first person to want to render code depending on a datetime.  However, if there are no ready made solutions, do you have any clues as to how to architect a mechanism to allow contentowners to maintain these partials without programmer involvementp

We detect the device server side and wrote this instead of the itms linep  precodemarketdetailsidcom.kaon.android.vstream codepre  pTrouble is, whereas iOS throws an error when you go to an unhandled url scheme, Android goes to a generated page.  Therefore, the timeout never gets a chance to run.p  pIs there some way on a web page to explicitly test for whether a custom URL scheme is handled, or can someone suggest a hack like this one that will work in Android  Of course, I suppose I need a hack thats going to work no matter what browser they are using, which is probably a tall order...p  pUPDATE The approaches below do not work in Jelly Bean on a Nexus 7. The new Chrome browser does not go to a generated page so the iFrame is not needed, but there does not appear to be any way to know whether the URL scheme was handled. If it was, the timeout fires anyway. If it wasnt handled the timeout fires. If I use an onload handler and an iframe, the onload handler never fires whether the app is installed or not. Ill update if I ever figure out how to know whether the scheme was handled...p  pIve removed my Solved on my previous solution, since it doesnt work any more.p  pUPDATE 2 I have a good crossplatform solution now that works on iOS, Android 4.1 with Chrome, and Android preChrome.

My controller takes both parameters and divides them and stores them in a guests object. My guests object will be an array of 1x number of guest objects. based on the number to split.p  pI then send that object to an update method in my sub view to update a XTemplate but that is not happening.

Negative 2775 pI came across Websockify [1] and the accompanying Websock clientside javascript library.p  pAIUI from the codeWrap a Programcodesection in README, Websockify can help you launch a TCP server and rebind its port so that incoming Websocketsbased communication is parsed and forwarded to the server on the proper rebinded port.p  pMy question is, can this mechanism be used to wrap a server that forks its children which in turn communicate with the client on a different port. Specifically, I am interested in websockifying a Postgres server, which typically listens on port 5432 and for a new incoming connection it forks a child which serves all future request from that client.p  pIf it helps, Oracle RDBMS and many other servers, RDBMS or not, also use similar method.p  p[1] a hrefhttpsgithub.comkanakawebsockify relnofollowhttpsgithub.comkanakawebsockifyap

Negative 2775 pThe best thing I like about ASP.NET MVC, is that you can directly call a server method called action, from the client. This is so convenient, and so straightforward, that I really like to implement such a model in ASP.NET WebForms too.p  pHowever, in ASP.NET WebForms, to call a server method from the client, you should either use stronga hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenusmagazinecc163480.aspx relnofollowPage Methodsastrong, or Web Services, both of which use SOAP as their communication protocol though JSON can also be used.p  pThere is also another substitution, which is using Generic Handlers.

Does it all make sense to store Boolean values as a sum in 1 column or not, so you have 7 columns instead of 11p  pThat values, thats clear because that table has much more rows that just 2, are not keys.p  pThank you.p

But maybe its overkill to reduce a 32 bit value to a 8 bit value if there are simpler algorithms for 8 bitsp

Negative 2775 pI am using the codeDataGridViewcode component to quickly and easily display readonly SQL query results to the user. I have it working as desired, but I have to wonder if Im doing things the right way. Its a complicated component after all, and I am completely new to SQL access and data binding in .NET.p  pThe MSDN help suggests using a codeBindingSourcecode object as the intermediary, so Ive come up with the following code which seems to work just finep  precodemBindingSource.DataSource  null mBindingSource.Clear  using SqlDataReader query  GetQuery    if query  null ampamp query.HasRows        mBindingSource.DataSource  query     CDataGrid.DataSource  mBindingSource     codepre  pHowever, I want to reformat some of this raw data. For example, some of the values are stored as codeintcode or codebytecode types in the underlying tables, but they actually represent various codeenumcode values. Currently I am using the following code to perform the desired transformation inspired by a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryz1cc356h28vVS.8029.aspx relnofollowthis MSDN pageap  precodeprivate void CDataGridCellFormattingobject sender, DataGridViewCellFormattingEventArgs args    DataGridViewColumn column  CDataGrid.Columns[args.ColumnIndex]   switch column.Name        case FieldNameProductID     case FieldNameVersionID       int x  args.Value as int       ProductCode code  ProductCodex  0       args.Value  code.ToString       break      case FieldNameProductType       byte y  args.Value as byte       ProductType type  ProductTypey  0       args.Value  type.ToString       break     codepre  pIs this the proper way to do things The reason I ask is because it seemed as if the codeBindingSourcecode object is designed partially to perform such types of transformations.

In fact HTTP is probably the second mostvulnerable protocol after BitTorrent. Why dont lock it down too Itll be absolutely safe if theres no open ports, wouldnt it I dont personally think blocking ports for POP, IMAP, Jabber, etc is any good. I think theyll probably seriously piss someone off if they even cant open mail teacher sent them. Oh, theres a webmail No no no SSLTLS goes on port 443, remember I dont think blocking all the traffic will be any good. IMO they should block unencrypted BitTorrent and apply lowpriority QoS for unclassified transfers.p

Negative 2775 pIm using MFCs docview architecture to implement printing. I use double buffering, I draw everything onto my backbuffer which is DIB bitmap. Than I use StretchBlt to copy that DIB onto printer DC.p  pThe strange thing is  print preview is working well When I print on virtual PDF printer, it is working well But when I print on actual printer Im testing on two different printers  same results  it just prints garbage. The garbage means sometimes it prints totally black page, sometimes it prints the first few pages repeatedly, i.e. it prints wrong part of DIB, just like if I messed up coordinates to StretchBlt, but I didnt mess anything up, I checked multiple times, plus why is print preview is working flawlessly thenp  pI tried many variationsp  ol liUsing memory DC compatible to screen DC, when printing.li liUsing memory DC compatible to printer DC, and selecting my DIB into it.li liUsing memory DC compatible to printer DC, and using dedicated DIB onto which I copy my original backbuffer DIB. etc.li ol  pBut the results are same.

Negative 2775 pI am implementing a task runtime system that maintains buffers for userprovided objects of various types. In addition, all objects are wrapped before they are stored into the buffers.

Negative 2775 pHeres a simplified version of a problem Im encountering at work. The details have been changed and more generalized so I can explain it easier.p  pLets say you have a blog engine that allows blog posts to be assigned tags when theyre created. So I could write a post titled My Vacation in Italy, and I decide to add the following tags to it codehasphotoscode, codevacationcode, codefamilycode. As part of my blog engine, I can create custom actions based on groups of tags. So I decided before writing it that any post with the tags codehasphotoscode and codefamilycode will be automatically shared on Facebook. When that post is created for the first time, I have to then automatically crossreference all of its tags with all actions that can be performed on combinations of those tags.p  pWhen the My Vacation in Italy post is saved, I then need to lookup all actions for the following groups of tagsp  ul licodehasphotoscodeli licodevacationcodeli licodefamilycodeli licodehasphotoscode amp codevacationcodeli licodehasphotoscode amp codefamilycodeli licodevacationcode amp codefamilycodeli licodehasphotoscode amp codevacationcode amp codefamilycodeli ul  pGenerating that query is trivial, I just get all the permutations of any length from the original tag set of the post. It comes out to being code2N  1code possibilities of tag combinations.p  pThe problem Im running into arises when you put this up against large datasets. What were dealing with are the followingp  ul li10,000 posts arriving dailyli li20 tags per postli li1,000s of actions existing already when blog posts arrive, with varying s of tags theyre triggered onli ul  pWhen a post arrives with 20 tags, that comes out to a little over a million permutations Id be generating a query for. Even if my database allowed me to send query strings to it that large hint it doesnt, itd still take forever to run.p  pIs there a clever solution to this Im not thinking of Right now as I see it, Im left with one possibilityp  h3Actions use OR instead of ANDh3  pI could change it so that when you create a predefined action, the tags it acts on are implicitly ORed instead of ANDed. Then the tag combinations drops from code2N  1code to just codeNcode. Unfortunately this would severely limit the usefulness of the tag action feature.p  pEdit Im not necessarily looking for an answer in SQL. Just a different approach to solving this problem, even if its just a high level description.p

This is not a question of a child themes functions.php being the same as the parent. This is far more complex..p  pI know precisely why this is occurring Since page1 is the container for page2, the functions in functions.php run when the page is loaded as it should. However, because page2 includes wpblogheader.php necessary for custom wp queries and metadata calls, when the javascript runs through page2 to insert its content inside page1, the very same functions.php runs again and causes the above error.p  pIm looking for a way around this. The javascript runs automatically on page load through ajax. Page2 must exist outside of page1  they cannot be merged in any way. Page1 and Page2 do NOT use the same hooks. Page2 in fact, doesnt even call to function contentAd.

Negative 2775 pI have a menubar based application, which displays a window, when the icon is clicked.

The plans is at some point have it dropped on a droppable within the area.p  pat this point, my problem is that i expand hilite with padding... which increases the size of the div without increasing usable space.

Negative 2775 pAlthough this code is from an algorithm text, I have a bit of a trouble regarding nested classes and interfaces  actually, 90 of my confusion arises from how this code implements the interface. Again, this question is not about the algorithm itself. p  pAs I understand, this code uses a nested class so that it can access the private instance variables in ResizingArrayStack this text uses a convention to declare all instance variables private for encapsulation. p  pThe codeIterablecode interface is thisp  precodepublic IteratorltItemgt  IteratorltItemgt iterator   ignore the quotes codepre  pand the codeIteratorcode interface is thisp  precodepublic interface IteratorltItemgt  boolean hasNext Item next void remove  codepre  pAnd my question is how all these connect in the code shown below.p  pThe parent class implements the Iterable interface, but where is the Iterator interface coming directly from when ReverseArrayIterator implements Iterator Is it coming from the Iterator instance method, or from the Iterable interface Intuition tells me that its implementing directly from the Iterator instance method and ultimately from the Iterable interface kind of like how extends work.p  pSorry for my lack of OOP knowledge..this text only briefly talks about it, and I was told that I didnt have to know any of this and I probably dont, as long as I understand the algorithms, but I HAVE TO UNDERSTAND IT lol.

I dont want to have to parameterise all of the fields in the stored procedure signature  stored procedure call construction, or the insert statement. p  pNotice that the composite type is declared twice to begin with. 1st in the codecreate tablecode statement in postgres, and secondly in scrapy using the item interface. So  p  pWhat is the cleanest way of getting a python dictlike entity into postgres using pyscopg2, without having to parameterise whilst at the same time being future proof i.e., no positional  paramterization. p  pIm thinking codetablenameROWTYPEcode should be declared as the stored procedure input parameter, but how do I map the python dictlike object when I create the execute query string  Something to do with a hrefhttpinitd.orgpsycopgdocsextras.htmlcompositetypescasting relnofollowcomposite type casing in psycopg2a I think. But I cant see the complete picture from the documentation.p  pFor the sake of argument lets consider a user table codeCREATE TABLE name character varying, id integer primary keycode with a corresponding scrapy type, and the primary id is unique implicitly in the domain.

Negative 2775 pI would like to parse long options in a shell script. POSIX only provides codegetoptscode to parse single letter options. Does anyone know of a portable POSIX way to implement long option parsing in the shell Ive looked at what codeautoconfcode does when generating codeconfigurecode scripts, but the result is far from elegant. I can live with accepting only the full spellings of long options. Single letter options should still be allowed, possibly in groups.p  pIm thinking of a shell function taking a space separated list of args of the form option[flags], where the flags indicate that the option takes an arg or can be specified multiple times. Unlike its C counterpart there is no need to distinguish between strings, integers and floats.p

Negative 2775 pI currently have a jquery selectable list set up and would like to have the ability for single items have a drop down for more information.

Negative 2775 pIs there any way to guarantee you access only blocks that map to the same set in an nway set associative cache if you dont know the level of associativity nor the size of the cache itself I know that given either level of associativity or cache size its possible to do this, but in this particular situation all Ive got is a lowballed estimate of the cache size. Ive thought about it for a while and Im starting to believe its not possible, but Im not definitively sure.p  pFor the sake of this question please assume that its impossible to obtain the level of associativity or the cache size by any means.p  pThe reason for this is that Im trying to quantitatively determine the level of associativity, but the algorithm I used to quantitatively determine cache size only gives exact results for cache sizes that are a power of two and it gives the nearest power of two estimate otherwise. Unfortunately the machine Im currently running on has a 3MB L2 cache.p

Negative 2775 pFor many reasons I prefer not to disclose long and boring story, I need to capture the interactions of a complex application with the Database. The application builds on top of SpringJdbcTemplate and I need to find all the SQL sent out by this application. How can I do that in the simplest possible way p  pCreating a pseudo mock implementation of JdbcTemplate does not seem reasonable. First off JdbcTemplate is a class and not an interface. Second it has a large interface that makes it tedious to implement. I am thinking along the lines of mocking codeDataSourcecode and codeConnectioncode to get all the SQL sent out, but maybe there is an easier way to do thisp

Negative 2775 pIve been working on this a hrefhttporchidaberdeen.com relnofollowwebsitea for quite some time now and ive encountered a bug that is trumping me at every point.p  pThe problem is in the gallery section of the site. When a user clicks on the circle the website splits open to reveal more thumbnails. When the user clicks on the smaller thumbnails a lightbox is supposed to appear. p  pSadly this is not the case, i think its due to the fact that there is to much jQuery being loaded at once. As the thumbnail pages are external html files being loaded by jQuery so when i try to load the lightbox plugin the browser doesnt seem to want to load it.p  pThe lightbox effect works when the page is viewed on its own individual pages for example here, a hrefhttporchidaberdeen.com6toggle1.html relnofollowhttporchidaberdeen.com6toggle1.htmlap  pThese are the things ive tried,p  precodefunction loading    .getjsview.min.jsauto, function      body.load6toggle1.htmlexternalContent     codepre  pIve also tried this,p  precode.plus1.clickfunction    .getScriptjsview.min.jsauto, functiondata, textStatus, jqxhr       console.logdata data returned      console.logtextStatus success      console.logjqxhr.status 200      console.logLoad was performed.     codepre  pThis line of code is loading the external html files, p  precodetslide.load6togglepage.html, function  codepre  pIf anyone has any suggestions or knows of a fix that can retrigger jquery after a page load or knows if this isnt even possible then it would be greatly appreciated.p  pMany thanks,p  pCameronp

Negative 2775 pSo, here is the situation.  I have several objects of the same type that are all listening to the same event.  The handlers of each of these objects manipulate some part of the DOM.  These objects can be recreated or destroyed at almost any time, when they are destroyed they take the part of the DOM they are responsible for with them.  The problem is that handlers for these objects stick around and continue to try to manipulate the DOM after the objects have been destroyed. p  pBelow is the code that I have that seems to work.  However I do not care for the way the handlers are destroyed and I suspect it may not be good for jQuery.

Negative 2775 pWere currently dealing with a performance issues in our app, and we believe that some of these issues might be related to the fact that the app and the underlying AFNetworking network stack seems to ignore keepalive on HTTP 1.1.p  pWe got information from Apple that persistent connections are purged after 3, 6 or 30 seconds respectively, depending on iOS version and WiFiWWAN connectivity, regardless of serverside keepalive information.p  pWhile monitoring the connection handshakes on our servers, we noted the weird behavior that an SSL connection from our app on an iOS device is left open and not closed with a FIN packet. As soon as new request is made from the app, the left over connection from the previous request is THEN closed with a FIN packet and a new connection is created.p  pWhile we understand that iOS purges the connections to keep the battery consumption low, we wonder that it doesnt terminate the existing connection properly and defers that termination to the start of a new request.p  pCould someone explain this behavior, and suggest solutions to avoid expensive SSL handshakes in connections which are covered by keepalive under regular conditionsp
Negative 2775 pI am processing a large set of files as follows I first download all of them to an EC2 instance and then I run a script that sequentially processes each file and indexes it into a DynamoDDB table each item in the table corresponds to a single line in a file. Then I download the next batch of files etc.p  pRight now I adjust provisioned throughput via AWS GUI console and it ends up being the same during both the download phase and the indexing phase. Clearly, this is suboptimal since while downloading I do not talk to the database at all so my required write throughput during this phase is essentially 0.p  pSo what I want to do is programmatically adjust provisioned throughput way up when I start indexing and then way down when I stop indexing and start downloading.p  pAre there any limits on how much I can increase write tp in a single request For instance, can I change it from 5 to 120 If not, how do i calculate the number of requests and the time required to adjust tp from value X to value Y where X ltlt Y Do I have to do similar calculation for decreasing tpp  pI am using Python boto.p  pThanks p

Negative 2775 pI am running a series of large simulations over a grid. I am implementing the simulations by row and I have found that my sampling functions are a bottleneck. Ive attempted to use the foreach and doMC libraries to speed up the process, but Ive found that either the parallel method is slower or Ive been unable to code a function that would would be correctly interpreted by foreach. p  pLooking at some other posts, It appears that my approach using foreach may be misguided in that the number of jobs Im attempting greatly exceeds the number of available processors. Im wondering if folks would have some suggestions for how to best implement parallelization in my situation. My simulations generally come in two types. In the first I calculate a matrix that contains a sampling interval rows for each element within the gridrow that I am processing. I then sample using runif in the real simulations my rows contain  9000 cells and Im performing 10000 simulations.  p  precodenumber of simulations per element  n  5  Generate an example sampling interval. m.int1 lt matrix  seq  1, 20, 1 , ncol10, nrow2   Define a function to sample over the interval defined in m.int1 f.rand1 lt functiona  return  runif  n, a[1], a[2]     run the simulation with each columns corresponding to the row element and rows  the simultions. sim1 lt round apply  m.int1, 2, f.rand1   codepre  pIn the second case, I am attempting to sample from a set of empirical distributions that are indexed by column in a matrix. The value of the gridrow element corresponds to the column to be sampled.p  precodenumber of simulations per element  n  5  generate a vector represeting a row of grid values  v.int2 lt roundrunif10,1,3  define matrix of data that contains the distributions to be sampled. m.samplesltcbindrep5,10,rep4,10,rep3,10    f.sample lt functiona  return  sample  m.samples [ ,a], n,     Sample m.samples indexed by column number. sim2lt sapplyv.int2,f.sample codepre  pIn the second example, I was able to utilize emforeachem and emdoparem to run in parallel, but the simulation took substantially longer than the serial code. In the case of the first example above, I could not write a proper function to take advantage of foreach parallelization. Ill put the code I used in the second case just to demonstrate my thinking  but I now realize that my approach is too costly in overhead.p  precodelibraryforeach librarydoMC registerDoMC2  n  5  Sample m.samples indexed by column number using parallel method. sim2.par lt foreach  i  1  length  v.int2 ,      .combinecbind dopar sample        m.samples [ , v.int2 [i] ] , n  codepre  pId appreciate some suggestions on an approach and some code that would help me utilizing parallelization efficiently. Again, the rows Im processing generally contain about 9000 elements and were conducting 10000 simulations per element. So my output simulation matrices are generally on the order of 10000 X 9000. Thanks for your help.p
Negative 2775 pAs I understand, the complexity of an algorithm is a maximum number of operations performed while sorting.

It only supports a few basic types like string, number, date stores only date, no time component, boolean, decimal.p  pWhen I sync for the 1st time, I can probably store the SyncId as a string in the Third Party Database. Later on I will need to retrieve the highest available Sync Id in this third party database. How can I implement my custom comparison logic  sorting logic, so that I can get the highest Sync Id.p  pFurther, how do I convert the SyncId string value back to native Sql Server datatype, when sending query or stored procedure parameter to SQL Serverp  pAny other ideas to implement a sync system to download incremental data changes from Sql Server 2008 to the third party databasep  pstrongEDITstrong While retrieving the SyncId from the SQL Server database and converting to string, I am getting an exception.

Negative 2775 pI am testing Neo4J as the searched database to my applications database SQL Server or Oracle.  My intention is to crawl the RDBMS database and copy the searchable content to Neo4J.  Later when the user requests a search, I can use the graph searching capabilities of Neo4J to find the records in my RDBMS database, by executing the search on Neo4J which will return the primary key values that meet the search criteria.p  pI have written a small C application using Neo4Client that reads two of the tables from the RDBMS database and creates the nodes and relationships between the nodes.  The two tables in this example are a formula header and its child table, formula ingredients.  p  pOn a small database 50 and 250 rows in the two tables, my crawl is very quick.  But testing the application with a large customer database 550K and 6M rows the crawls are proving to be too slow.  On some older hardware I use for testingresearch I am getting 4 rowssecond estimating 36 hours to crawl the 550K table.  On my newer development system, I am getting 14 rowssecond estimating 10 hours to crawl the 550K table.p  pI know that the Neo4JClient driver uses the Neo4J REST interface, and given this similar a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10983967neo4jclientdataimportquestiona, it seems like Neo4J will not be suitable for my project.  p  pIve thought about multithreading, but I dont think that will fit this scenario. I do intend on multithreading this application but not at the individual table being crawled.  The tables in the RDMBS that I want to crawl are logically related, hence the Neo4J Relationships, and there are several sets of these table groups.  I had planned on spinning a thread per table set. Ultimately, I would have 75 tables in 12 sets of tables that I would need to crawl, and I think this level of performance would be impractical on a production environment.p  pI have a hrefhttpdb.tt5IbvH7iX relnofollowposteda my sample code with the hopes that someone can tell me I am doing something in a less than optimal way.  One thing I would like to know if there is a way to create a node with an index emandem a relationship  Currently that is a twostep process, albeit it will not impact the performance numbers I mention above because the code for the 550K table doesnt use relationships.  My test app first creates the header nodes the 550K table, which is what the performance figures I mention above are based on, and then creates the ingredient nodes and the relationship to the header node.  I anticipate that when I test the creation of the ingredient nodes, my performance numbers will be even slower.p  pThanksp

Negative 2775 pI have a lot of virtualhosted websites that are currently being updated via chrooted SFTP. Updates are done by clients Typically using Dreamweaver and CuteFTPFilezilla and staff at my company typically using Eclipse Team Syncronisation with JCraft SFTP. This setup works ok unless the clients are editing their site at the same time we are. In that case we have to constantly sync to check for changes which is both slow and unreliable. Also SFTP transfers are slow given the huge number of files in each site, slow directory traversal and lack of deltacompression.p  pI want to move to a partial Git workflow mostly to benefit from deltacompression but also to introduce some rudimentary revision control. I say rudimentary because the typical git workflow of developing and testing locally before bundling changes into git commits is a poor fit for our needs becausep  ul liSome of our clients will strongneedstrong to use SFTP, not Git for convenience or compatibilityli liI dont want to force a particular SFTP client like gitftp. Our clients are comfortable with their own choice Dreamweaver or CuteFTP for example. They may be on any OS and they dont use shells.li listrongNonestrong of our clients can test locally, every small change strongmuststrong be uploaded to the webserver and go live immediately we have test sites so live doesnt necessarily mean production or public in this caseli liAbout 90 of changes will be small 1line CSSHTML changes making commit messages time consuming.li liSome changes are done directly on the server webroot via a shell or scripts.li ul  pI guess what I want is for the remote git repo to use the webroot as a working directory and autocommit any file changed there with a generic message indicating which files changed. However I keep reading that the primary repo for a project shouldnt have a working directory git init bare and even if it does it wouldnt normally commit changes made there. I dont care if this setup loses ownership details of commits since it wont know who changed the files and I typically dont care.p  pFailing that I basically want to use Git as an alternative to RsyncoverSSH which does not appear to be supported by Eclipse Team Sync. Any answer suggesting another technology needs to support Eclipse my tool of choice and Dreamweaver my clients main tool of choice. I realise this is not ideal but it isnt negotiable. If I could force use of Git I would and this issue would be irrelevant. I have to deal with hundreds of clients, mostly Graphic Designers on Macs.p  pPS. I realise there will be issues when the clients dont resync their local files regularly enough. Any suggestions on handling that would be appreciated.p  pCan anybody provide guidance on this setup Centos 6.4 linux.p

This means that the loading time of the page is not acceptable 56 seconds.p  pMy question is Can I optimize this function so that it strongreads the HTML as plain textstrong without loading at the background all images Is there any way to minimize these requests p  pNote Unfortunately, PHP is not an option.p

Negative 2775 pThere are N colors of beads. You have bi beads of the ith color. You want to make an ornament by joining all the beads together. You create the ornament by using the following algorithmp  pStep 1 Arrange all the beads in any order such that beads of the same color are placed together.p  pStep 2 The ornament initially consists of only the first bead from the arrangement.p  pStep 3 For each subsequent bead in order, join it to a bead of the same color in the ornament. If there is no bead of the same color, it can be joined to any bead in the ornament.p  pAll beads are distinct, even if they have the same color. How many different ornaments can be formed by following the above algorithm Two ornaments are considered different if two beads are joined by a thread in one configuration, but not in the other.p  pclarificationp  pThink of the bead formation as a tree and not as a straight line. Any number of beads can be connected to a bead.p  pThis problem is driving me crazy I am told you must use Cayleys algorithm to get all the ways to build a tree for each of the beads of color ci and then you must join the trees together. Supposedly there is this formula for joining components into a tree, s1s2. .. sk  nk  2, but I am not sure if I have the formula right nor am I convinced. Is anybody familiar with this formula and or can help me with this problem. Thanks guys. Oh by the way this is the algorithm I have so far.

Negative 2775 pI am working with a Non US version of QuickBooks online QuickBooks Online Plus Australia. Im trying to deal here with our Goverment services tax or GST which is 10. What I want to do is create a sales receipt that calculates the total charge to the customer and strongemdisplaysemstrong the GST component through calculation. Right now the GST is being added to the charge, I simply want to acknowledge how much GST is included in the total charge.p  pI am using the traditional SDK QBXML for QB online SalesTaxLineAdd. I have alternatively tried setting up the tax through the GST centre but doing so seems not to be harmonious with the SDK because when I create a sales receipt through the SDK in line with the GST centre, for the field All Amounts Are it automatically sets it as Out of Scope of GST and ideally I would want this to automatically be Inclusive of GST. For the line Items the SDK doesnt set the GST Which field at all which then requires manually setting it to GST. What would be ideal is if the SDK did this all automatically.p  pAs a workaround using the SDK and the SalesTaxLineAdd element, I have been subtracting 10 from each line item price so that SalesTaxLineAdd adds the 10 which then represents the true total. I will accept this If I have to but if a customer calls and asks how much they paid for their last order I will be telling them the price exclusive of gst.p  pIf I work with the REST API v2 is it more flexible for this specific scenariop  pYour help is appreciatedp

This is working great since the data is being read into the correct cells of my data format.p  pWith my current understanding of the specification it seems that the only way to count the number of columns in the spreadsheet is to enumerate through each row and count the number of cells. Whilst this is relatively easily, it would be convenient to know the column count embeforeem filling my data structure.p  pIs there a way to efficiently determine the number of columns in the spreadsheet without having to consider each row individuallyp

Negative 2775 pI am working on a very large game project in Symfony, and keep running into variations of the same problem.p  pI have a service that I need to separate into multiple subservices because there is too much code to be contained within one class.  For instance, a custom JSON serializer handler that needs a separate handler service for each method of serialization.p  pIm having trouble working out the best practice for passing dependencies between families of services.  I would preferably like to keep all the definitions within services.yml just so things dont break in the future, but am assuming that may not be achievable.p  pHeres a better example  I have an ActionQueueService which takes a rather lengthy queue of actions from the user.  What I would like to do is create a separate class to handle each type of action, so p  ul liActionQueueService  processes action queue JSON and delegates to subservicesli liAbstractActionli liPurchaseAction extends AbstractActionli liSellAction extends AbstractActionli liHarvestAction extends AbstractActionli ul  pNow if these three actions are defined as services they can have their own dependencies.  However, they all have to be injected into the ActionQueueService  what happens if there are 38 of them which there will be one day.p  pThe next logical step for me was to create ActionFactory.  Now Im only passing in one dependency to ActionQueueService, and it can invoke any action service simply by calling p  precodethisgtactionFactorygtgetHarvest codepre  pThe problem I have is that each child has its own separate list of dependencies.  A Purchase or Sell action would need the Character service and the ShopStock service, a HarvestAction would need the HarvestService.  Because Ive decided to use a Factory method, I have to instantiate the subservice within the factory class.  I dont want to pass every dependency into the Factory only to have that either a inject every dependency into every child or b handle some crazy child constructor logic.p  pOne solution would be to pass the service container into the factory and come up with a naming convention that allows me to create the service on the fly.  Ive heard that this is fairly bad practice though.  Maybe a wrapper around the service container that limits the amount of bad stuff that could be done with it.p  pIf anybody has any ideas on how this could be solved with Symfony Id appreciate it.  There are similar answers out there but unfortunately I dont know any languages other than PHPSymfony.p

Negative 2775 pIm trying to retrieve entries from a python dictionary in jinja2, but the problem is I dont know what key I want to access ahead of time  the key is stored in a variable called codes.coursecode. So my problem is I need to doublesubstitute this variable. I dont want to use a codeforcode loop because that will go through the dictionary way more than is necessary. Heres a workaround that I created, but its possible that the codes.coursecode values could change so obviously hardcoding them like this is bad. I want it to work essentially like thisp  precode if s.course  p11      coursecodes.p11  elif s.course  m12a      coursecodes.m12a  elif s.course  m12b      coursecodes.m12b  endif  codepre  pBut I want it to look like thisp  precodecoursecodes.s.course codepre  pThanksp

Negative 2775 pThis is my first time creating a custom view and Im trying to populate it with entries via XML  in a manner similar to a Spinner.  Im obviously doing something wrong here, but Ive styled my approach after the Spinner, so I fail to see what has gone wrong.p  pTo explain the intent of this code, Im creating a custom preference list.  MultiChooserOption is an item that allows a user to select multiple things from a list of options.  TextOption simply defines the view that will be displayed in the list, i.e. ther e is a caption and some other element, for subclasses of TextOption the other element will be text as opposed to a widget checkbox, etc..p  pBelow is the source for everything that should have any impact on the way Ive built this as well as my logcat output.p  pattrs.xmlp  precodeltresourcesgt      ltattr

Negative 2775 pIm trying to display a Bitmap on a form, but the problem is I have to resize it beforehand for it to even fit. Its a large map like an actual map...geographical, so of course if I make it really small just to fit on the form, it wont be readable. So, I figured my only option was to possibly add in some sort of scrolling functionality. That way I could the keep the full size of the image, and still have it contained with my form. I would just have to use vertical and horizontal scroll bars around a specified area of in which I could navigate the entire map. Keep in mind, I do need some room within the form for buttons, checkboxes, etc.p  pI looked around for some information on the subject, and I wasnt really able to find anything besides something on CodeProject. However, it was related to VC and dialogs, and Im using C. p  pAs of now, the only thing I can think of is to make a borderless second window with horizontal and vertical scrolling enabled on creation, size it accordingly, and pin it to my main window. I could then place the Bitmap within entire size of the second window, and it should work like I want it to. Is that even possible Does anyone have any suggestions on what I should dop

Negative 2775 pMy Rails app uses Devise for authentication. It has a sister iOS app, and users can log in to the iOS app using the same credentials that they use for the web app. So I need some kind of API for authentication.p  pLots of similar questions on here point to a hrefhttpjessewolgamott.comblog20120119theonewithajsonapiloginusingdevisethis tutoriala, but it seems to be outofdate, as the codetokenauthenticatablecode module has since been removed from Devise and some of the lines throw errors. Im using Devise 3.2.2. Ive attempted to roll my own based on that tutorial and a hrefhttpdanrodriguez.mepost54352441822this onea, but Im not 100 confident in it  I feel like there may be something Ive misunderstood or missed.p  pFirstly, following the advice of a hrefhttpsgist.github.comjosevalimfb706b1e933ef01e4fb6this gista, I added an codeauthenticationtokencode text attribute to my codeuserscode table, and the following to codeuser.rbcodep  precodebeforesave ensureauthenticationtoken  def ensureauthenticationtoken   if authenticationtoken.blank     self.authenticationtoken  generateauthenticationtoken   end end  private    def generateauthenticationtoken     loop do       token  Devise.friendlytoken       break token unless User.findbyauthenticationtoken token     end   end codepre  pThen I have the following controllersp  pstrongapicontroller.rbstrongp  precodeclass ApiController lt ApplicationController   respondto json   skipbeforefilter authenticateuser    protected    def userparams     params[user].permitemail, password, passwordconfirmation   end end codepre  pNote that my codeapplicationcontrollercode has the line codebeforefilter authenticateusercode.p  pstrongapisessionscontroller.rbstrongp  precodeclass ApiSessionsController lt DeviseRegistrationsController   prependbeforefilter requirenoauthentication, only gt [create ]    beforefilter ensureparamsexist    respondto json    skipbeforefilter verifyauthenticitytoken    def create     buildresource     resource  User.findfordatabaseauthentication       email params[user][email]          return invalidloginattempt unless resource      if resource.validpasswordparams[user][password]       signinuser, resource       render json          success true,         authtoken resource.authenticationtoken,         email resource.email              return     end     invalidloginattempt   end    def destroy     signoutresourcename   end    protected      def ensureparamsexist       return unless params[user].blank       render json          success false,         message missing user parameter       , status 422     end      def invalidloginattempt       warden.customfailure       render json          success false,         message Error with your login or password       , status 401     end end codepre  pstrongapiregistrationscontroller.rbstrongp  precodeclass ApiRegistrationsController lt ApiController   skipbeforefilter verifyauthenticitytoken    def create     user  User.newuserparams     if user.save       render         json Jbuilder.encode do j           j.success true           j.email user.email           j.authtoken user.authenticationtoken         end,         status 201              return     else       warden.customfailure       render json user.errors, status 422     end   end end codepre  pAnd in strongconfigroutes.rbstrongp  precode  namespace api, defaults  format json  do     devisefor users   end codepre  pIm out of my depth a bit and Im sure theres something here that my future self will look back on and cringe there usually is. Some iffy partsp  pstrongFirstlystrong, youll notice that codeApiSessionsControllercode inherits from codeDeviseRegistrationsControllercode whereas codeApiRegistrationsControllercode inherits from codeApiControllercode I also have some other controllers such as codeApiEventsController lt ApiControllercode which deal with more standard REST stuff for my other models and dont have much contact with Devise. This is a pretty ugly arrangement, but I couldnt figure out another way of getting access the methods I need in codeApiRegistrationsControllercode. The tutorial I linked to above has the line codeinclude DeviseControllersInternalHelperscode, but this module seems to have been removed in more recent versions of Devise.p  pstrongSecondlystrong, Ive disabled CSRF protection with the line codeskipbeforefilter verifyauthenticationtokencode. I have my doubts about whether this is a good idea  I see a lot of a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7600347railsapidesignwithoutdisablingcsrfprotectionconflictinga or a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11008469arejsonwebservicesvulnerabletocsrfattackshard to understanda advice about whether JSON APIs are vulnerable to CSRF attacks  but adding that line was the only way I could get the damn thing to work.p  pstrongThirdlystrong, I want to make sure I understand how authentication works once a user has signed in. Say I have an API call codeGET apifriendscode which returns a list of the current users friends. As I understand it, the iOS app would have to get the users codeauthenticationtokencode from the database which is a fixed value for each user that never changes, then submit it as a param along with every request, e.g. codeGET apifriendsauthenticationtokenabcdefgh1234code, then my codeApiFriendsControllercode could do something like codeUser.findbyauthenticationtoken params[authenticationtoken]code to get the currentuser. Is it really this simple, or am I missing somethingp  pSo for anyone whos managed to read all the way to the end of this mammoth question, thanks for your time To summarisep  ol listrongIs this login system securestrong Or is there something Ive overlooked or misunderstood, e.g. when it comes to CSRF attacksli listrongIs my understanding of how to authenticate requests once users are signed in correctstrong See thirdly... above.li listrongIs there any way this code can be cleaned up or made nicerstrong Particularly the ugly design of having one controller inherit from codeDeviseRegistrationsControllercode and the others from codeApiControllercode.li ol  pThanksp

In the documentation I found that it is possible to set multiple axes but the problem is that it only shows how to specifiy axis for each series.

Negative 2775 pIm currently developing an app that needs to display a map of where the user is currently located in the world. For technical reasons, I need to access every map tiles as an image pngjpg before going in the rendering pipeline.p  pI have tried 3rd party services like MapBox, MapQuest as they have a REST api that enables me to receive a pngjpg of a tile according to the requested location. The issue here is that MapBox isnt free, so I was wondering if there was a way to access the tiles that Apple provides in its maps app. What service are they using under the hood Would I be violating some terms of use by going with this approach.p  pPlease note that using some integrated doitall UIMapView is not an option for me, I need the image directly.p  pThanksp

Negative 2775 pOn the official django site, for version 1.6, under design philosophy , it says pretty URLs should be easier to make than ugly ones. But when I search the site, I cant find any other use of the word pretty.

Can anyone point me to something like that Thx.p

Negative 2775 pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comqfeJ6.jpg altCalendar in Chrome img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comZfq1v.jpg altCalendar in Firefoxp  pMy issue is that within Google Chrome the left and right borders in the images above the .today styling is overriding the left border of a td are somehow cascading unto the td of a below tr as seen above, 1st image. This doesnt occur in either Firefox as seen above, 2nd image or IE identical to 2nd image. I cant find any reason as to why this is happening obviously, else I wouldnt be here.p  pSo Ive got a calendar Table with three tr rows for each day Datebox, Multiday and Singleday. Like thisp  precode DateDay1, tr1, td1  DateDay2, tr1, td2    SingleDay1, tr2, td1, NoValue  MultiDay2, tr2, td2    Notd  SingleDay2, tr3, td2    DateDay3, tr4, td1  DateDay4, tr4, td2    SingleDay3, tr5, td1  SingleDay4, tr5, td2    SingleDay3, tr5, td1  SingleDay4, tr5, td2  codepre  pAs demonstrated above if an event that is displayed within calendar either spans multiple days or spans an entire day a new tr called multiday is created. Any days that have events in them but are only active during certain hours of the day e.g. 230 to 530 appear in the multi day row but have the class of singleday. Any nonmultiday events that take place on the same day as a multi day event appear underneath the multiday event on the single day tr. If there are no events on a multi day row then the single day tr contains no tds. If on a calendar week there are no multi day events then the single day tr takes the space of both rows. The Multi day tds have this styling attached to themp  precodeblocksystemmain tr.multiday td.multiday     border 1px solid 7C7F12 borderleft 2px solid 7C7F12 borderright 2px solid 7C7F12  codepre  pThe single day tds dont have this styling on them. The calendar is a drupal 7 Module with custom css on it. Ive checked and double checked that all tags are closing correctly.

Negative 2775 pI have a c program with opencv library which takes an image as input and perform pose estimation,color detection,phog. When I run this program from the command line it takes around 45sec to complete. It takes around 60cpu. When I try to run the same program from two different command line windows at the same time the process takes around 1015 sec to finish and both the process finish in almost the same time. The CPU Usage reaches upto 100. p  pI have a website which calls this c exe using exec command. So when two users try to upload an image and run it takes more time as I explained above in the command line. Is this because the c program involves high computation and the CPU reaches 100 it slows down But I read that the CPU reaching 100 is not a bad thing as the computer is using its full capacity to run the program. So is this because of my c program or is it something to do with my servercomputer settings This is probably not the apache server problem because when I try to run it from the command line also it slows down. I am using a quad core processor and all the 4 CPU reaches 100 when I try to run the same process at the same time so I think that its distributed among all the processor. So I have few more questionsp  p1 Can this be solved by using multithreading in my c codeAs for now I am not using it but will multithreading make the c code more computationally expensive and increase the CPU usageif this is the problem.p  p2 What can be the reason of it slowing down Is the process in a queue and each process is ran only a certain amount of time and it switches between the two processp  p3 If this is because it involves high computation will it help if I change some functions to opencv gpu functionsp  p4 Is there a way I can solve this problems any ideas or tipsp  pI have inserted the result of top when running one process and running the same process twice at the same timep  pVersion5 is the process,running it once img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comV9KVi.png altenter image description here Two Version5 running at the same time img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comh6aP4.png altenter image description herep  pThe CPU info img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comzxctd.png altenter image description herep  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 2775 pim very new to Android SDK, so excuse my silly question. I made a simple app with an ImageView set as background    androidbackgrounddrawableimage  and i added two zoom buttons, so i can zoom in and out the picture that is on the whole screen.So my question is should i use OnTouchListener or is there a better way to just move the picture view up,down, left or right with my finger, i just need these basic events, nothing else.

Negative 2775 pIntro I have an IOIOOTG Board that is attached to an android device via a USB connection. My IOIOOTG board is supposed to launch a looper upon connection, however this never seems to happen.p  pThe only reason I believe it doesnt seem to happen is because when I implement fragments into the class it wont launch the looper, however if I just use a regular IOIOActivity instead of a IOIOFragmentActivity which I created it all works fine. However then I cannot use fragments.p  pIf anyone has any ideas on this matter about what could be blocking my inner looper class from being created and called thatd be appreciate.p  pMy Codep  precodepackage com.example.ioiofinal  import ioio.lib.api.AnalogInput import ioio.lib.api.DigitalInput import ioio.lib.api.DigitalOutput import ioio.lib.api.IOIO import ioio.lib.api.IOIOFactory import ioio.lib.api.PwmOutput import ioio.lib.api.TwiMaster import ioio.lib.api.exception.ConnectionLostException import ioio.lib.api.exception.IncompatibilityException import ioio.lib.util.BaseIOIOLooper import ioio.lib.util.IOIOLooper import ioio.lib.util.android.IOIOFragmentActivity  import java.util.Locale   import android.annotation.SuppressLint import android.app.ActionBar import android.app.FragmentTransaction import android.content.Context import android.os.Bundle import android.support.v4.app.Fragment import android.support.v4.app.FragmentManager import android.support.v4.app.FragmentPagerAdapter import android.support.v4.view.ViewPager import android.view.Gravity import android.view.LayoutInflater import android.view.Menu import android.view.MenuItem import android.view.View import android.view.ViewGroup import android.widget.CompoundButton import android.widget.Switch import android.widget.TableLayout import android.widget.TextView import android.widget.Toast  public class MainActivity extends IOIOFragmentActivity implements         ActionBar.TabListener      IOIO ioio             The link android.support.v4.view.PagerAdapter that will provide       fragments for each of the sections.

It outputs an SVG and then a bunch of circle elements. All I want to do is append my own tooltip to the circles I dont want to use theirs. But the tooltip doesnt append, or insert before, or prepend.

Negative 2775 pI am creating an iOS framework project which is basically an SDK for a system we are developing. I followed a hrefhttpcodefriend.blogspot.in201109creatingiosframeworkwithxcode4.html relnofollowthisa guide to create a universal framework bundle of the SDK.p  pThe first time I built the framework bundle, its size was 2.1MB. After that I kept making very minor changes in the code for optimizations and bug fixes and now the framework size has increased to 3.4MB. I do not link against or include any external library or framework, I did not add any extra files to the project and the code optimizations and bug fixes are merely minor replacements to existing code. I have also tried clean and clean build folder every time but for some reason, after every iteration the framework bundle size keeps on increasing.p  pI do not have a problem with the size of the framework bundle, but I would like to understand, what causes the bundle size to increase significantly after negligible changes in code. Am I doing something wrong or am I missing something herep  pPS I am using Xcode 5.1p

Negative 2775 pMy Django project has models codeShopTypecode and codeShopItemcode. For each codeShopTypecode object I create, I want to associate  not a single codeShopItemcode object  but a emsubclassem of codeShopItemcode. Basically, I want a model type in Django that is not a TextField or an ImageField or the like, but a iModeliField.p  pExample Using the Django admin interface, I create a new instance of codeShopTypecode called codeCheeseShopcode. This in turn creates a new Model called codeCheesecode which inherits all of its behavior from codeShopItemcode. If I go to the main page of my Django admin site, theres now a new link called Cheeses, and I can create a bunch of codeCheesecodes as I please.p  pOf course, I suspect thats not actually possible If I create  say  codePetShopcode, I wouldnt just have to add a new record to the database, Id have to augment the database schema itself to include codePetcodes along with registering the new codePetcode Model with the admin interface and probably some other complicated things I havent thought of yet.p  pBut maybe theres an existing Django solution for this pattern Or maybe theres a completely different, bettersuited approach to the problem that might achieve the same effectp  pAny thoughtsp

You might want to consider using resetboard instead of destroy if you want the program to automatically relaunch after closing.p

The mainpage has a TableLayout that contains dynamically generated buttons. However if the user logs out and back in again, all of these buttons are repeated so I am trying to find out how best to remove these buttons after they are generated.

Negative 2775 pI just upgraded to from Visual Studio 2013 Premier Update 1 to Visual Studio 2013 Premier Update 3.  Everything seemed fine until I tried to debug a REST service using WizTools REST Client which is an awesome tool, btw.  The first time I hit the service endpoint, the break point hits and I can step through and debug just fine.  No problem.  But then, if I try again, the break point is never hit.  The service runs and the resulting JSON appears in the results window of the WizTool client, but, no break point, so I cant debug.p  pIve done this a million times with VS 2008, 2010, and 2013 update 1.  Its always stopped at the break points no matter how many times I hit the REST service endpoint.  The ONLY thing thats changed here is that I upgraded to Update 3.  No config changes, no solution changes, no nothing, except the upgrade to Upgrade 3.p  pIve searched here and in Google for a similar problem, and all I found was this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions22334206whydoesvisualstudionothitbreakpointuntilseconddebugsessionWhy does Visual Studio not hit breakpoint until second debug sessionap  pHe seems to be having the opposite problem  It doesnt hit the first time, but does every other.  And, hes debugging unit tests and Im debugging REST service end points dont know if that matters.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 2775 pIve found many posts on how DNS lookups are slow due to a Bonjour issue causing slow page load on OS X. I am quite certain that is not my issue since I am using valid live hostnames rather than .local and Firefox tells me the lookups are instant. I also have local name resolution with the hosts file.p  pIve looked at the logs, cleaned up the minor issues and its still slow. As a test I put errorlogFileUpdate START .dateHis in as the very first line of the file and errorlogFileUpdate END .dateHis at the end as well as some throughout my php file thinking mySQL was the problem. The longest from start to finish is 1 second.p  pRandomly, when I load the page it takes as much as 10 seconds before the START log entry appears. At this point there is no database access and this is the first line of code executed by php. This problem started a few days ago and I do not recall making changes to my system. It happens with all pages and all sites as well as phpMyAdmin so its not my code. This site is lightning fast on the production server.p  pI upgraded MAMP Pro from 2 to 3 and no difference. Ive tried turning XDebug off and turning on php cache module. No differencep  pIm running 2.33GHz Quad core i7 with 16G RAM, OS X 10.9.5, SSD.p  pI can post the logs if anyone wants to see them but the only thing there is startup info. Loading the pages only output my log entries for testing.p  pIm asking for ideas on what to try next. Ten second page loads really slows down creativity.p

Negative 2775 pI think my issue is pretty simple, I have very limited experience and am just getting into coding for conditional situations. There are questions here similar to mine but dont answer exactly my question.p  pI want to use a macro or formulas to organize data from one sheet raw data into another organized data. In my raw data sheet, column DG contains words Id like to search for, and column DI contains the data I want copied. I want the macro to go through column DG and copy all of the values in DI that are in the same row as a cell in DG with the value FS or something else, and is it OK if its not a number. Then I want to repeat for different values in DG but I dont care if I have to use a different macro for each value in DG. I can do this myself for a fixed number of rows, but my issue is making the macro conditional for a variable number of rows. I tried doing this with formulas but of course it only copies the first number with the matching FS instead of copying all the different numbers. Id paste what I have here but I generated it by recording my actions and would probably just embarrass myself rather than help.p  pSorry if I am misusing terms like value I am assuming nonnumerical text in an excel cell is still called a value...p

Negative 2775 pwe were having a discussion today at work about a recurring situation in our codebase Say we have a particular domain object in our software e.g. Customer. Additionally we have a group of customers relevant for a specific use case in our system. We have business logic that works on a specific customer e.g. getRevenue and other parts that work on the whole  group of customers e.g. getAverageRevenue, getNumberOfActiveCustomers,.... The group functionality also includes methods that changes certain Customers in the group, or that searches for certain sub groups in the group,etc.. e.g. getCustomersWithoutOrdersSince.p  pHow would you go about such a situationp  ol liMake a Customer class and a CustomerGroup class The CustomerGroup class has its customers in a private member stdvector or in Java in a List. Group related functionality is implemented as member functions of CustomerGroup.li liMake just a Customer class, Leave the stdvector or List of customers with the caller Add single customer functionality in member functions of Customer. CustomerGroup related functionality is realised as static methods of Customer e.g. static int getAverageRevenuevector ampcustVector or in Java static int getAverageRevenueListli liVariation of Nr. 2 C only Make just a Customer class, Leave the vector of customers with the caller implement CustomerGroup functionality as nonmember functions in namespace Customerli li...li ol  pHow would you implement such a scenario or what are the advantagesdisadvantages in your opinion.p  pIn item 23 of Effective C Prefer nonmember nonfriend functions to members functions Scott Meyers advocate to move stuff out of classes in nonmember functions.

Negative 2775 pSo Im working through iOS Games by Tutorials from Ray Wenderlich. Currently, making a Tiled TMX map. They use JSTileMap but one they modified themselves. The one you can currently get from GitHub is different because it uses int amp unsigned int as suchp  precodeproperty assign, nonatomic int parentGID property assign, nonatomic unsigned int orientation codepre  pWhere as, the books included JSTileMap uses NSInteger amp NSUInteger insteadp  precodeproperty assign, nonatomic NSInteger parentGID property assign, nonatomic NSUInteger orientation codepre  pIf Im not mistaking, then this is good, especially since Apple wants everyone to convert their apps to 64 bit int is 32 bit amp NSInteger supports 64 bit is what Im told on the internetz. So I decided to go through JSTileMap.h amp .m amp manually convert all these values just for giggles amp came across some parts that got me confuzzled when I compared what the Ray boys did in comparison to what the GitHub code has. For instance, in GitHub version of JSTileMap, there were 2 methods as such amp they dont give off any warnings in the codep  precode SKSpriteNodetileAtCoordCGPointcoord    NSString nodeName  [NSString stringWithFormatd,intcoord.x  coord.y  layerInfo.layerGridSize.width]   return SKSpriteNode[self childNodeWithNamenodeName]    warning need to write setTileGidAt   voidremoveTileAtCoordCGPointcoord      uint32t gid  [self.layerInfo tileGidAtCoordcoord]      if gid               int z  coord.x  coord.y  self.layerInfo.layerGridSize.width           remove tile from GID map         self.layerInfo.tiles[z]  0          SKNode tileNode  [self childNodeWithName[NSString stringWithFormatd,                                                     intcoord.x  coord.y  self.layerInfo.layerGridSize.width]]         iftileNode             [tileNode removeFromParent]       codepre  pBut the Ray boys code had switched int for NSInteger causing Xcode to warn Values of type NSInteger should not be used as format arguments add an explicit cast to long instead...what givesp  precode SKSpriteNodetileAtCoordCGPointcoord    NSString nodeName  [NSString stringWithFormatd,NSIntegercoord.x  coord.y  layerInfo.layerGridSize.width]   return SKSpriteNode[self childNodeWithNamenodeName]    warning need to write setTileGidAt   voidremoveTileAtCoordCGPointcoord      uint32t gid  [self.layerInfo tileGidAtCoordcoord]      if gid               NSUInteger z  coord.x  coord.y  self.layerInfo.layerGridSize.width           remove tile from GID map         self.layerInfo.tiles[z]  0          SKNode tileNode  [self childNodeWithName[NSString stringWithFormatd,                                                     intcoord.x  coord.y  self.layerInfo.layerGridSize.width]]         iftileNode             [tileNode removeFromParent]       codepre  pWhat I dont understand is why they didnt replace uint32t with uint64t then amp Why that 2nd method has int at the end instead of NSInteger In my code, I replaced uint32t with uint64t amp int to NSInteger amp warnings for that 2nd method disappeared. What I also really want to know is, should I continue in the same spirit modifying 32 bit values to 64 bit valuesp

Heres the code...p  precodepackage testit  object testit     abstract class UPairs[T]     def getFirstT     def getSecondT       class UString extends UPairs[String]     def getFirstString       def getSecondString         object UString      def apply  new UString       class UInt extends UPairs[Int]     def getFirstInt  1     def getSecondInt  1       object UInt      def apply  new UInt       abstract class Unary   case class Positive extends Unary   case class Negative extends Unary    def unaryFunc[T]uUnary, pUPairs[T]T       u match        case Positive gt p.getFirst       case Negative gt p.getSecond            def mainargsArray[String]Unit       printlnunaryFuncPositive, UString     printlnunaryFuncNegative, UInt     printlnunaryFuncPositive, UInt       codepre  pNote The above code works and produces the correct results and restricts the input to valid parameters.p

Return the number of paths from topleft cell to bottomright cell.i.e. 0,0toM1,N1.

Negative 2775 pI am trying to implement a C11 wrapper to C API of SQLite, particularly to sqlite3bind functions. I would like it to be something in the shape of this example from my codep  precodesqlt3execltvoidgt     db,     INSERT OR REPLACE INTO window VALUESposition, 3, 4n     INSERT OR REPLACE INTO window VALUESsize, 1, 2n     INSERT OR REPLACE INTO window VALUESmaximized, 5, 0n,     size.x,     size.y,     position.x,     position.y,     staticcastltintgtIsMaximized      codepre  pThe problem here is that codecode are shared between different statements. The codeexeccode function internally prepares subsequent SQL statements one by one. So I cannot determine which parameters should be bound to which statements, because there is no API to get which statement slots the statement contains. I can get the count of slots codencode a max NNN from all NNNs but I am unable to determine whether particular slots from zero to the codencode are actually occupied. It is because there can be single codecode with no number and codesqlite3bindparameternamecode returns codeNULLcode for both the nameless parameter and the lack of parameter. Ideally I would like to have some function that returns a list of indexes of binding points that are used in the given statement or at least some way to discriminate whether given index has associated nameless binding point or no binding point at all.p  pOne solution that I came upon is to bind all parameters, in the order they are passed to the codeexeccode, to all of the statements but I didnt found in the documentation is it legal to bind to nonexistent parameter. Another drawback is that the complexity is codevcode times codescode where codevcode is number of variables to be bound and codescode is number of statements. p  pSo, I came with another workaround to just parse whole string passed to codeexeccode and gather info about binding points codecode, codeNNNcode, codeVVVcode etc.. But, I think it isnt quite trivial task because that special symbol are not special in some contexts like string and quatations. So, what are another contexts in SQL statements, in which special tokens codecode, codeNNNcode, etc. have not meaning of binding pointsp  pstrongSome explanationsstrongp  pTrying to parse SQL is pointless.p  pI do not want to parse SQL, only detect presence and indexes of arguments binding points.p  pDo you really think vs will become large enough that it matters p  pIn common case no, but still I do not know if it is legal to bind parameter to slot that wasnt occurred in statement. And there is a problem with codecode, if it occurs at the beginning of second sentence, it should not has index 1, it should rather have index of the last binding point in previous sentence increased by 1.p  pAnd why do you want to allow multiple statements in a single function call p  pI found ability to do that very handy, especially when you need to execute them in one transaction.p

Negative 2775 pIm working on an ASP.NET MVC 5 web application, hosted on Azure, which currently has the following setupp  ul liweb role 1 an ASP.NET MVC project for the UI mostly a single page application with AngularJS and bootstrapli liweb role 2 an ASP.NET MVC Web Api project contains API controllers, handles all authorization, data access EntityFramework 6, caching, etc. the API controller REST operations are called async via AngularJS from the UI in web role 1li ul  pThese web roles are combined in 1 Azure Cloud service, including a SQL Azure database for data storage. Web role 2 uses inrole caching to cache most used entities. The reason for using the Cloud service, is that the inrole cache is shared between all instances of web role 2, inside the Cloud service.p  pMy initial reason to seperate UI from the actual work over 2 web roles, was to optimize performance, by not having cache and data handling interfere with presenting the UI. Also, when needed, I can configure extra instances for any of the roles in Azure, and can specify maximum cache size to use for role 2 without having it take memory from role 1. This all actually works well.p  pNow for the question... it can be a pain to maintain and update these 2 roles. Also, clientside can be a little tricky with CORS HTTP POST not working well in all mobile browser over https etc. So I was thinking of combining the 2 applications into 1 1 project in 1 web role, with both the MVC and MVC web api stuff. Would this perform as well as the separate setup I could configure the web role to use more instancesmemory in Azure. Would that be as good as having 2 separate roles with their own instances, especially on high loads with a lot of async calls going on from client to serverp  pOn a side note I was playing around with ASP.NET 5 vNext, with MVC 6, which has eliminated the differences between normal MVC controllers and Web API controllers. This also tempts me to make my 2 separate projects into 1 ASP.NET 5 project. Theres no support in the Azure SDKVisual Studio to deploy an ASP.NET 5 project in an Azure Cloud Service, but thats probably a matter of time.p

Negative 2775 pOkay, so first I will paste the problem details, then I will ask the question.p  pRead in a file with the coords of vertices and triangles made by those vertices. The first line of the file is the number of vertices, followed by the coords of those vertices. Then, it has the number of triangles, followed by the indices of the vertices of that form this triangle. Use a struct array in order to save the points of your mesh. Use a matrix or array of integers to represent the triangles in your mesh. Download the file sphere.txt from class files. The total area of all triangles should be close to the area of the represented sphere which is 4pi.p  pOkay, well I did all of this, and checked my values for a,b,c using  Area  sqrtssasbsc method of calculating area of triangle. The answers I got on Matlab for a few tested values of a matched what I got from a calculator, so I know the a,b,c values are right, however, I end up with an area of 41.6997 and not 12.5664, I think there is something small Im missing near the end of code.p  precodeA  fopensphere.txt,r nv  fscanfA,f,1  fori1nv   vertexi.x  fscanfA,f,1   vertexi.y  fscanfA,f,1   vertexi.z  fscanfA,f,1 end  nT  fscanfA,f,1 nI3nT  fori1nI   Ii  fscanfA,f,1 end  fori1nT   ai  distformvertexIi.x,vertexIi.y,vertexIi.z,vertexIi1.x,vertexIi1.y,vertexIi1.z    bi  distformvertexIi1.x,vertexIi1.y,vertexIi1.z,vertexIi2.y,vertexIi2.y,vertexIi2.z    ci  distformvertexIi.x,vertexIi2.y,vertexIi.z,vertexIi2.y,vertexIi2.y,vertexIi2.z    Si  aibici2   Ai  sqrtSiSiaiSibiSici end  AreasumA TotAreasprintfThe area of the 3D shape is approx.  .4f,Area dispTotArea codepre

Negative 2775 pIm developing an Android app for salesman, so they can use their device to save their order. Specifically, every morning the salesman would go to the office and fetch the data for that day. p  pCurrently, I can get the data by sending a request to codephpcode file, and like common practice we insert those data into codesqlitecode in the Android so it can work offline. However, with current approach the device needs 68 seconds on getting the data and inserting those data to codesqlitecode. As the data grow bigger I think it would make it slower. What I had found is that the process of inserting data into codesqlitecode takes quite amount of time.p  pSo, Ive been thinking about dumping all data that is needed by the salesman into a codesqlitecode file, so I could send only that file which I guess is more efficient. Can you please lead me on how to do that Or is there any other way which is more efficient approach for this issuep  pNotep  ul liServer DB Mysqlli liServer PHPli ul

Negative 2775 pWe are developing a small application that needs to have a local database installed on each users computer that will then sync up to the main database, via web services etc...p  pAnyways when we deploy the application on the users computer we want to use clickonce deployment. Now I have used this before but not attaching a SQL Server database. I know you can go to prerequisites in clickonce properties and click SQL Server Express.p  pNow the question is, when you have created your code.mdfcode database file including stored procedures and all  how do you get this attached and setup automatically in the local database that is just installed through clickoncep  pAlso once this is finished in the future we may want to run updates to the database on the clients machines. We would like to use clickonce for this to publish database updates. Obviously we dont want to overwrite the database and just publish the latest updates based on if they already have the database or not and what version they have.p  pHow could this be achieved using clickonce Thanksp

Negative 2775 pSo I have a game that has two sets of teeth.   The problem is that these objects are created and deleted many times.

Negative 2775 pSo, Im working on an app which is a web based app. The apps code base is mostly written in JavaScript and HTML. The app is also available on a native app which basically only contains a codeWebViewcode displaying the HTML and JavaScript code. p  pMy problem is that when a user is on the Android native version and launching an external link, it opens perfectly in the Android codeWebViewcode but there is some cases where the launched page not is scrollable and other strange stuff.p  pSo to solve this issue I need the native app to launch the inbuild browser in the Android phone. Basically, the exact same effect that codestartActivitynew IntentACTION.VIEW,URIcode has.  The thing is that I cant modify the Android version though all the logic is written within the web app..p  h2My question ish2  pIs there any way to simulatep  precodestartActivitynew IntentACTION.VIEW,URI codepre  pin JavaScript to get out of the native app and launch the browser insteadp
Negative 2775 pIn ASP.NET MVC, you get the default codeAspNetUserscode table that stores all user data.p  pNow in most projects, you want to refer to the user that created, for example, a post. You also want to keep your database logic separate from your web logic, so you most likely put database logic in a class library. p  pBut then, you encounter some issues How do I refer to a codeAspNetUsercode Should I move the codeApplicationUsercode to the class Library Should I even add foreign keys to this tablep  pIve seen many questions and answers about emhowem to add a foreign key to codeAspNetUsercode table and emhowem to move the codeApplicationUsercode part to the Class Library, but I have my doubts in terms of security for the following thingsp  ul liPart of the database is going to be exposed through an API, mostly for AngularJS ClientSide calls, but later perhaps for thirdparty websites. Having a foreign key to the codeUserIdcode in the a table will expose the codeUserIdcode on a GET call, which Ive been told that this should be kept secure... rightli liIsnt the default security logic template created in such a way that modifying it should be avoided Moving codeApplicationUsercode to class Library.li liTo get the logged in user you have to use codeSystem.Web.HttpContext.Current.User.Identity.GetUserIdcode, which Im not sure about how secure this is in a class library and if this is any good as it uses codeSystem.Webcode, is it common to use this in a class library that should only handle database logicli liIt still requires an correct connection string in web.config, so the database handling still isnt really separated from the MVC application.li liCalling the database correctly for userId should be avoided according to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma228355402901207thisa answer.li ul  pSo lets just say this is not a good way of creating your project, what are my alternatives How would I correctly refer to an userp  pIn another project I used a third table, which contains additional information about the user, where one string is the email address. This email address is sequel and unique to the logged in Username codeUser.Identity.Namecode. This third table is only exposed through the API in such a way that it hides the email address. It still requires codeSystem.Web.HttpContext.Current.User.Identity.Namecode though.p  pMy question to you guys is, strongWhat is best practice in 2015strongp

It then goes ahead and tells us that to solve this problem, we should monkeypatch an codeactsasauditedcode method into the codeActive RecordBasecode object, as followsp  pthe book suggests putting this file in codelibcoreextactiverecordbase.rbcodep  precodeclass ActiveRecordBase    def self.actsasauditedauditlogDEFAULTAUDITLOG       auditor  Auditor.newauditlog       aftercreate auditor       afterupdate auditor       afterdestroy auditor    end end codepre  pwhich enables you to write the Account Model class as followsp  precodeclass Account lt ActiveRecordBase    actsasaudited    ... end codepre  hr  pBefore reading the book, I have already made something similar that adds functionality to multiple Active Record models. The technique I used was to create a Module. To stay with the example, what I have done was similar top  pI would put this file inside codeappmodelsauditable.rbcodep  precodemodule Auditable    def self.includedbase       auditlog  base.auditlog  DEFAULTAUDITLOG The base class can override it if wanted, by specifying a self.auditlog before including this module       base.aftercreate auditaftercreate       base.afterupdate auditafterupdate       base.afterdestroy auditafterdestroy    end     def auditaftercreate       auditlog.createdself.inspect    end     def auditafterupdate       auditlog.updatedself.inspect    end     def auditafterdestroy       auditlog.destroyedself.inspect    end end codepre  pNote that this file both replaces the codeAuditorcode and the monkeypatched codeActiveRecordBasecode method. The codeAccountcode class would then look likep  precodeclass Account lt ActiveRecordBase    include Auditable    ... end codepre  hr  pNow youve read both the way the book does it, and the way I would have done it in the past. My question strongWhich version is more sustainable in the longtermstrong I realize that this is a slightly opinionated question, just like everything about Rails, but to keep it answerable, I basically want to knowp  ul liWhy would you want to monkeypatch codeActiveRecordBasecode directly, over creating and including a codeModulecodeli ul

Again leaving me with no bread crumbs to the root source. p  pWhile the application was inoperable I was able to do test entries from VS running a production build, which is what lead me to restarting the app pool on the server for my application.. p  pI hope it doesnt happen again, but as time has proven if it happens once it will happen again. p  pAny ideas or directions I should go if its not an error caught on Client Side JSp

Negative 2775 pIm trying to time limit a socket.io connection time on a node.js server.
