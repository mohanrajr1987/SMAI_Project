Positive 7496 pI am using SAS 9.4.  I want to write a JSON Web Signature JWS to complete my JSON Web Token JWT  I already have the header and claims encoded and tested.

The output will be a byte array.p  pHowever, I am confused about what key to use or whether I should be using a key as some sites example above just suggest hashing the encoded headerclaims while others suggest hashing using a secret key while say private key  and the github page URL above just uses a key.p  pI am also confused about sha1 vs. sha256.  The Google docs sate sha256 but some have suggested sha1 in this Stack Overflow thread questions18362327creatingdigitalsignatureusiningsasforgoogleapigeocodep  pAgain, I have verified my header and claims SAS code work using strongjwt dot iostrong and strongkjur dot github dot iojsjws tooljwt.htmlstrongp  pSince SAS supports Groovy PROC GROOVY I assume that I can write my JWT successfully using java code but I have not yet been able to replicate any JWT in my SAS code using examples found on the sites I have mentioned above and others.p  pHas anyone ever done this before using SAS to connect to Google APIs using JWTp  pAny help is appreciatedp

Negative 7496 pFirst of all, let me say I am very new to rails, have been working with it for only a couple of days.p  pMy first application is a little different from traditional on one of my model classes I have parts of data that is pulled from a database and other part that is acquired by doing an HTTP REST request to an external resource.p  pI have implemented lazy loading for the external resource but, every time the user hits a page that needs one of the fields that are tied to that resource, I reexecute the HTTP request, which obviously doesnt scale.p  pMy question would be what caching strategy do you think is worth for this scenario How can I have a cache only for the data that is lazy loaded via HTTP Id like to implement a cache that could expire both by time lets say 5 minutes or when user executes an action that should invalidate this current cache.p  pHow can I implement it and what would be the memory tradeoff to keep those caches Would it be advisable to keep that data on a session or on a separate structure on the server Should I consider one of those external caching frameworks like GigaSpaces, etc...p  pThanks in advance for any tips you may offer to this problem.p

There is a lot of theory out there but very few clear examples.

Negative 7496 pOk, so here is a problem analogous to my problem Ill elaborate on the real problem below, but I think this analogy will be easier to understand.p  pI have a strange twosided coin that only comes up heads randomly 1 in every 1,001 tosses the remainder being tails.  In other words, for every 1,000 tails I see, there will be 1 heads.p  pI have a peculiar disease where I only notice 1 in every 1,000 tails I see, but I notice every heads, and so it appears to me that the rate of noticing a heads or tails is 0.5.  Of course, Im aware of this disease and its effect so I can compensate for it.p  pSomeone now gives me a new coin, and I noticed that the rate of noticing heads is now 0.6.  Given that my disease hasnt changed I still only notice 1 in every 1,000 tails, how do I calculate the actual ratio of heads to tails that this new coin producesp  hr  pOk, so what is the real problem  Well, I have a bunch of data consisting of input, and outputs which are 1s and 0s.  I want to teach a supervised machine learning algorithm to predict the expected output a float between 0 and 1 given an input.  The problem is that the 1s are very rare, and this screws up the internal math because it becomes very susceptible to rounding errors  even with highprecision floating point math.p  pSo, I normalize the data by randomly omitting most of the 0 training samples so that it appears that there is a roughly equal ratio of 1s and 0s.  Of course, this means that now the machine learning algorithms output is nolonger predicting a probability, ie. instead of predicting 0.001 as it should, it would now predict 0.5.p  pI need a way to convert the output of the machine learning algorithm back to a probability within the original training set.p

Negative 7496 pFor my application, I am trying to add entries without having a duplicate entry, and if there are a duplicate notify the user and have him try again. Using SQLite, which I know very very little about, I have tried these two ways and want to know which one is better, more efficient or a better way to develop itp  pFirst wayp  precodedb.execSQLINSERT INTO   DatabaseHelper.DATABASETABLE   LATITUDE, LONGITUDE, RATING SELECT   latitude  ,   longitude  ,   rating   WHERE NOT EXISTS SELECT 1 FROM   DatabaseHelper.DATABASETABLE   WHERE LATITUDE    latitude   AND LONGITUDE    longitude   codepre  pSecond wayp  precodelong id  1 try  id  db.compileStatement SELECT COUNT FROM   DatabaseHelper.DATABASETABLE   WHERE LATITUDE    latitude   AND LONGITUDE    longitude .simpleQueryForLong  catch NullPointerException e  return 1  return id codepre  pThe first way, either inserts or ignores the values, I check by doing so, storing the rowcount of the rows into a variable before the call, call that function, and then check its results. If the results is not higher than it was before the call, the insert was made ignored, prompt the user with the values exist message. Very sloppy, I know but desperate times calls for desperate measuresp  pThe second way, returns the actual count of rows that match the numbers I want to store, if the number returned greater than 1, prompt the user with the values exist message.p  pI have been going back and forth, trying different ways but I do not know how to set up SQLite to have UNIQUE pairs, which I was told would be the easiest. If anyone can correct either of these ways andor comment on them, thatd be greatly appreciated. p  pThanksp
Negative 7496 pI need to store a 2d matrix containing zip codes and the distance in km between each one of them. My client has an application that calculates the distances which are then stored in an Excel file. Currently, there are 952 places. So the matrix would have 952x952  906304 entries.p  pI tried to map this into a HashMap[Integer, Float]. The Integer is the hash code of the two Strings for two places, e.g. A and B. The float value is the distance in km between them.p  pWhile filling in the data I run into OutOfMemoryExceptions after 205k entries. Do you have a tip how I can store this in a clever way I even dont know if its clever to have the whole bunch in memory. My options are SQL and MS Access...p  pThe problem is that I need to access the data very quickly and possibly very often which is why I chose the HashMap because it runs in O1 for the look up.p  pThansk for your replies and suggestionsp  pMarcop
Negative 7496 pI have an application that runs in fullscreen mode and has been working fine.  Now I need to add a simple, undecorated dialog and Im running into trouble.  If I run the application strongmaximizedstrong but not in fullscreen, the dialog displays and functions as expected.  When I switch back to fullscreen, the dialog will not display.p  pThe dialog extends JDialog and only contains a JSlider and a couple of buttons.  It is undecorated and strongnot modalstrong.  I disabled modality for testing purposes  it was a pain to force exit the app every time the dialog blocked input.  Im entering full screen mode using codesetFullScreenWindowcode, passing in the main JFrame for the app.  It doesnt make a difference if I set that very JFrame as the owner of the JDialog or not.  Nor does it seem to help if I call codetoFrontcode on the dialog.p  pThe dialog seems to be active  especially since it blocks input if I make it modal  but just not showing or being hidden.  So, strongis there any obvious trick to displaying a JDialog in fullscreen modestrong  Something I might be overlooking or omittingp  pIf theres no obvious solution, I can post some code later.  Unfortunately, I dont have time right now.p
Negative 7496 pThis is all in C, using .NET 2.0.p  pI have two lists of objects. They are not related objects, but they do have certain things in common that can be compared such as a Guid based unique identifer. These two lists need be filtered by another list which just contains Guids which may or may not match up with  the IDs contained in the first two lists. p  pI have thought about the idea of casting each object list to just object and sorting by  that, but Im not sure that Ill be able to access the ID property once its cast, and Im thinking that the method to sort the two lists should be somewhat dumb in knowing what the  list to be sorted is. p  pWhat would be the best way to bring in each object list so that it can be sorted against the list with only the IDsp
Negative 7496 pI found a GreaseMonkey script on Userscripts which corrects spelling and some grammar which Im trying to improve for use on Reddit etc.  Ive had some help from there improving it, and a hrefhttppaste.pocoo.orgshow147551 relnofollowthisa is my current version which does work quite well.p  pThere is, however, a problem in that it capitalises italics, bold and links. I would like to have the script ignore all child nodes, or at least those which are em italic, strong bold or a link.  Ive tried a lot of searching and reading, but Ive not yet found a way to do this.  It seems that for other purposes everyone wants their script to work on children as well.p  pI imagine there are different ways of doing this  perhaps prevent it including them in the first place, strip them out straight after that, or prevent the replacement loop working on them if they meet some criteria.  Unfortunately Im not very experienced in javascript, hence why Im asking here.p

Negative 7496 pIm trying to implement fireandforget on an img src... call from a web page, and am looking for the most solid method. Whyp  pIn most Web tracking systems like Omniture or Coremetrics, there is a request for an img src which also happens to carry all the data for the tracking system to record. Like any other image request, the page tries to wait for the response, potentially slowing down the pageload.p  pWhat Im trying to do is implement a tracking system where webpage response time is a much higher priority than whether the request was actually successful, and therefore waiting for the response is totally unnecessary under all conditions, which include...p  ol liThe server received the request, and can readily respond HTTP response code 200li liThe server received the request, but is bogged down and can still readily respond with an error 500 response codeli liThe server is not running at allli liThe server was not found due to DNS glitchesli liThe request hit the server, but is so bogged down that its taking noticeable time to respond.li ol  pI have already investigated using the XMLHttpResponse object and an asynchronous request that can quietly fail, but you quickly run into the same origin policy and browser compatibility code bloat.

Negative 7496 pDevelopment environment is C 3.5 with a SQL Server 2008 database and Entity Framework.p  pImagine you have a class and a table called Sign which represents a physical electronic sign created by a third party which your software needs to control. You also have a class called SignDriver which takes care of actually communicating with the signs. The propertiescolumns of Sign represent configurable information needed by the Sign Driver to properly talk to the signs.p  pEverything is great and youve patted yourself on the back quite thoroughly. Then the need arises to talk to a different sign. However this sign works differently to the previous one and requires your Sign class and table to store additional information. Lets say 5 new things columnsproperties need to be stored, but, unfortunately the first type of sign does not need these 5 things. You then find when you want to control 10 of each type of sign, you have many NULL values in your table.p  pYour domain model grows until you have more classes like Sign, each representing a different part of your problem domain and each with a corresponding table in your database. Each class suffers the same issue of collecting the common information of its type well, but NOT catering for the specialisations of each type well at all.p  pYou realise that the nature of your problem means that there are going to be more types of signs to control, as well as more types of your other entities to cater for. You need a more extensible model.p  pWhat would be the best way forward for a system like thisp  pI have discussed this at length with my collegues and would really like to know what the best way to approach a problem like this is. Especially because it seems like a problem MANY people would have faced in the past.p  pBelow are the options weve come up with and some points about eachp  ul liCreate emnem number of type classes and table for each entity to share a 1 to 1 relationship with. ul liVery inheritancey.li liMost time consuming when extending.li liMany tables.li ulli liCreate one extended properties table for each entity to hold keyvalue pairs. ul liReferential integrity.li liExtensible.li ulli liCreate one global extended properties table to store properties for ANY entity. schema entityType, entityId, key, value, dataType ul liSuper extensible.li liCannot have referential integrity with existing tables.li liDoesnt look like Entity Framework will be able to handle this well.li ulli ul  pWhat would you do and whyp  pAny help greatly appreciated.

Negative 7496 pAs many of you may know, an NSTreeController bound to an outline view can display duplicates while presenting core data entities. p  pA temporary solution is to add parent  nil to the predicates, but this only returns parent entities. If, for instance, a user is searching for a subentity, the requested subentity wont be displayed.p  pA proposed solution is to subclass NSTreeController and add a NSMutableSet variable, which keeps track of entities that are currently being displayed. This variable should be alloced on init, and released on dealloc.p  pWhen fetchWithRequestmergeerror is called, the set should be emptied Im not sure whether this would be more efficient than releasing it and allocating it again. Everytime an entity is going to be added to display, check if the set contains it. If it doesnt, add it. Otherwise, find which is closer to the root which is the subentity and either skip it if its the subentity, or swap it with the previously included one.p  pI think there should be relatively little impact on performance considering NSSet uses hashing. The problem Im having is finding the correct method to override to add this behavior. Specifically, where NSTreeController processes fetched entities after fetchWithRequestmergeerror is called.p  pIf anyone has any ideas or feedback, let me know. Thanks ahead of time.p
Negative 7496 pIm writing a lexer with re2c and a parser with Lemon for a slightly convoluted data format CSVlike, but with specific string types at specific places alphanumeric chars only, alphanumeric chars and minus signs, any char except quotes and comma but with balanced braces, etc., strings inside braces and strings that look like function calls with opening and closing braces that can contain parameters. p  pMy first shot at it was a lexer with many states, each state catering to the specific string format. But after many unhelpful unexpected input messages from the lexer which got very big I realized that maybe it was trying to do the work of the parser. I scrapped my first try and went with a lexer with only one state, many character tokens and a parser that combines the tokens into the different string types. This works better, I get more helpful syntax errors from the parser when something is off, but it still feels not quite right. I am thinking of adding one or two states to the lexer, but initiating the states from the parser, which has a much better overview on which string type is required in a given instance. Overall I feel a bit stupid   p  pI have no formal CS background and shy a bit away from the mathheavy theory. But maybe there is a tutorial or book somewhere that explains what a lexer should and should not do and which part of the work the parser should do. How to construct good token patterns, when to use lexer states, when and how to use recursive rules with a LALR parser, how to avoid ambigous rules. A pragmatic cookbook that teaches the basics. The Lex and YACC primerHOWTO was nice, but not enough. Since I just want to parse a data format, books on compiler building like the red dragon book look a bit oversized to me.p  pOr maybe someone can give me some plain rules here. p

Negative 7496 pMy friend and I are entering our final year at the university M.Sc. in 2 months and as such we have to start thinking about our dissertation as we decided to write one together. After giving it some thought we came up with a topic which would involve both a lot of thinking and implementing, as we really wanted to do something practical that we could actually show in our portfolios  we will be designing and implementing a large system for didactics support for our university. The plan looked great on paper Im a java guy Java EE, so Id be in charge of the web stuff, the views, server logic etc., and hes into databases OracleMySQL, and well this system will be really all about the databases.p  pThe problem is now that I think about it I dont really see how would the teamwork look like, I mean I did a few medium size Java EE projects, Ive been working for a monthtwo at a small comapny, but I never had a database programmer on my team, in most cases I did everything by myself with JPAHibernate I didnt really need to write the databases I just used the appropriate annotations etc.. So basically my question is how do people divide work when you have someone whos good at writing the presentation layer and the server side logic and someone whos really really good at databases Or maybe we went in a completely wrong direction and such combinations arent necessarypossiblep  pEdit ok my bad, I thought dissertation is also when youre doing a Master degree which Im doing now. Whether this is a boring andor well suited topic for an M.Sc. thesis let me just say that I did put a lot of thought and consideration before choosing it and Im happy with my choice  sorry for the smiley, I know some people find them juvenile. Oh also I guess I didnt really mention this as I didnt think its all that important  the system itself is only a part of the thesis, the main part is to actually come up with a way to plansupport the didactic process creating the classes scheduel etc. which apparently isnt all that simple as my university, or at least my faculty, is struggling with it every single semester p

This would require me to     save the login and password in the     script, in plaintext.

Negative 7496 pIs there any nice pattern in .Net for ensuring that iDisposable fields owned by an object will get disposed if an exception is thrown during construction, possibly during a field initializer  The only way to surround field initializers in a TryCatch block is if the block is outside the call to the constructor, which will make it rather difficult for cleanup code to properly dispose of anything.p  pThe only approach I can figure would be to the object inherit from a base class whose constructor takes something like an array of iDisposable, and sets the first item in that array to point to itself.  All constructors the descendant classes should be Private or Orotected, and include that parameter.  Instantiation should be via factory methods, which will declare an array of one iDisposable and pass it to the appropriate constructor.  If the constructor fails, the factory method will have a reference to the partiallyconstructed object, which it can then dispose the dispose method must, of course, be prepared to accept the possibility that the object may not be fully constructed.p  pThe approach could be extended by having the object keep a list of iDisposable objects it creates, to allow the objects to be cleaned up without having to explicitly dispose each one such a list would be useful in conjunction with the factorymethodcallsdispose approach, but is largely orthogonal to it.p  pAny thoughtsp

Negative 7496 pGood morning all.p  pIm relatively new to the Visual Basic realm although a traditional web based script developer, ive come to ask you a question.  I am reading data from an XML file.  This local XML file will be updated by another application, and I will need to periodically reevaluate the XML file, and only import new data into a list box.  Furthermore, I want to be able to click on a particular item in the listbox, and display the other values about that particular XML entry.p  pSo, I suppose this is a multi part question.  What is the proper way to import only NEW data into the program, what is the proper way to store the data, and how do I associate a value in a listbox with the data stored elsewherep  pIve considered multidimensional arrays, but have been told that strings to char arrays and then back to strings is a terrible way to manage the data, but was never offered an alternative.p  pI will be satisfied with a list of topics to study up on andor an example for an answer to this question.p

It has an ASP.NET web page as frontend and a WCF service as backend for storing the messages to a database.p  pEverything works great except one thing when Browser A enters a chat message I want Browser B to see the message as soon as possible yeah, I know, thats the purpose of a chat.p  pWhat Ive done so far is to setup a trigger within the UpdatePanel, like thisp  precodeltTriggersgt     ltaspAsyncPostBackTrigger ControlIDchatTimer EventNameTick gt ltTriggersgt codepre  pwhich uses a timerp  precodeltaspTimer IDchatTimer runatserver OnTickchatTimerTick Interval1000 gt codepre  pIs this the best approach or is there a better, yet simple, way to accomplish updating of messages. One drawback with this solution is that the textbox used to enter chat messages loses focus every time the Tick event runs.p  pAny piece of feedback or advice regarding updating of messages is appreciated.p  pThank youp

Negative 7496 pI have a table that contains various types of settings. I want to display and validate each setting differently in a form. For example if the setting is for an integer or for a string.p  pThis is my modelp  precodeclass Settingmodels.Model     SETTINGTYPES           u1, uDecimal,         u2, uInteger,         u3, uString,          type  models..CharFieldmaxlength2, choicesSETTINGTYPES     name  models.CharFieldmaxlength50, uniqueTrue     value  models.CharFieldmaxlength200 codepre  pSo if the type is 1 I want to restrict form entry and validate against the fact that Im expecting a decimal. But if the type is 3, I need to show a bigger entry form and validate against the fact im expecting a string.p  pA few places I can see with possibility to do this isp  ol liIn a custom widgetli liBy overriding the BaseModelFormSet class to change field properties on init a hrefhttpsnippets.dzone.compostsshow7936 relnofollowhttpsnippets.dzone.compostsshow7936ali liby using a custom template filter that will evaluate what the type is and then render the form manually via a custom template for that setting typeli listore the type and value together in a jsonfield and use something like  a hrefhttpwww.huyng.comarchivesdjangocustomformwidgetfordictionaryandtuplekeyvaluepairs661 relnofollowhttpwww.huyng.comarchivesdjangocustomformwidgetfordictionaryandtuplekeyvaluepairs661a to alter the display and validation of the setting value in one place..li ol  pWith option 1, im not sure if I use a custom widget on the value field if it will be able to access the type field to determine how to represent the valuep  pI tried option 2, and while I could access the form elements, I could not access the form values to determine the type of the setting maybe they werent bound yet. I think this route might be the simpliest but I will need access to form values..p  precodeclass BaseSettingFormsetBaseModelFormSet     def initself, args, kwargs         superBaseSettingFormset, self.initargs, kwargs         for form in self.forms              here i would access the type value and then change the widget propeties below             if form.fields[type]  3  DOESNT WORK                   change the widget and field properties                 form.fields[value].helptextsome text                 form.fields[value].widget  CustomWidget  or switch from decimal to string widgets..  def editProfilerequest, strategyid     settingModelFormset  modelformsetfactoryprofile, formsetBaseSettingFormset      ... retrieve the values and show them.. codepre  pwhile posting this i did find a post that may allow me to bind the form during the init and therefore have access to the value, see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1226590djangohowcaniaccesstheformfieldfrominsideacustomwidget21357392135739django  how can I access the form field from inside a custom widgeta p  pOption 3 works for displaying the field, but not for validating any data.  I think I would need to combine it with option 2 to validate it during save.p  precodeCustom template filter register.filternameshowsetting def showsettingform        setting  fieldvalueform[type]  calls another function to retrieve value works ok      render page using custom template that can alter the form to show a small field or text area etc.      can also add js validations here.. but no server validations     if setting         return rendertostringsettingstrsetting.html,  form form  codepre  p.p  pWhich method would be best or is there another way, and how do I complete it  Or am I going about this the wrong way, is there a more djangoesc way to solve my problemp

It took my hours today to write this but now im stuck The problem is, in the second level of this game after failure or success i cant see the red tiles.

Negative 7496 pI am new in Python. My task was quite simple  I need a list of functions that I can use to do things in batch. So I toyed it with some examples likep  precodefs  [lambda x x  i for i in xrange10] codepre  pSurprisingly, the call of p  precode[f0 for f in fs] codepre  pgave me the result like [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]. It was not what I expected as Id like the variable i has different values in different functionsp  pSo My question is 1 Is the variable i in lambda global or localp  p2 Does python has the same concept like closure in javascript I mean does each lambda here holds a reference to the i variable or they just hold a copy of the value of i in eachp  p3 What should I do if Id like the output to be [0, 1, .....9] in this casep

Negative 7496 pI wrote a multithreading application for parsing logfiles. Its based on the mutex buffer example from a hrefhttpdrdobbs.comcpp184401518pgno5 relnofollowhttpdrdobbs.comcpp184401518pgno5a.p  pThe idea is having a buffer class that has functions to put items into the buffer and take items out of it. The Synchronization of the reading and the writing threads is handled using conditions. While buffer is not full, new items are written into the buffer and while its not empty, items are being read from it. Otherwise threads will wait.p  pThe example uses a fixed amount of items to process so I changed the reading thread to run while there is input from file and the processing threads run while theres input or while there are items left in buffer.p  pMy Problem is if I use 1 reading and 1 processing thread, everything is ok and stable. When I add another processing thread theres a big boost in performance and its still stable even after 10.000 testruns.p  pNow when I add another processor thread 1 read, 3 processing, programm seems to hang deadlock periodically but not every time and is either waiting for buffer to fill or to get empty.p  pHow come 2 threads doing the same thing synchronize stable and 3 of them crashp  pIm a newb to C threading so perhaps any of you more experienced coders know what can cause this behaviorp  pHeres my codep  pBuffer Classp  precodeinclude StringBuffer.h  void StringBufferputstring str        scopedlock lockmutex     if full  BUFSIZE                     boostmutexscopedlock lockiomutex         stdcout ltlt Buffer is full.

This is not good.p  pSay I have 2 threads waiting for buffer to fill. As soon as reader reads a new line maybe the last few lines theres 6 other threads that try to get this lines and lock the item so the 2 waiting threads maybe dont even have a chance to try to unlock it.p  pAs soon as they check a line is taken by another thread and they keep waiting. The Reading thread doesnt notify them when it reaches eof and then it stops. The both waiting threads wait forever.p  pMy Reading function aditionally has to notify all threads that it reached eof, so threads shall only remain waiting if buffer is empty and file is not EOF.p

Apparently, Intel doesnt really care about alignment. Aligned stuff is faster but not mandatory, and the program works fine this way. My problem was I didnt clear the data buffer before writing stuff and this caused trouble with the constructors of some types.

Negative 7496 pIm having a very strange problem with this bit of code, sorry its pretty messy. Basically its a pagerank algorithm. Each struct webpage is contained in the dynamic array pages. The pages vector is put through the algorithm until its absolute value strongPstrong is smaller than epsilon. Now the issue is with lines 195201. If i remove the iteration over the array in those lines i.e. an empty while loop, it works for cases that only require one iteration. However, when i do have the for loop even for one iteration cases, it throws error6 line 179, debugging shows e  NULL without even having run over the inserted loop. Ive set breakpoints etc, and still gives error6 without even having read the extra code. Whats going on here Im pretty new to C and parallel programming so its probably something fundamental.

Negative 7496 pIm currently trying to get an ANN to play a video game and  and I was hoping to get some help from the wonderful community here.p  pIve settled on Diablo 2. Game play is thus in realtime and from an isometric viewpoint, with the player controlling a single avatar whom the camera is centered on. p  pTo make things concrete, the task is to get your character x experience points without having its health drop to 0, where experience point are gained through killing monsters. Here is an example of the gameplayp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com2NslT.jpg altherep  pNow, since I want the net to operate based solely on the information it gets from the pixels on the screen, it must learn a very rich representation in order to play efficiently, since this would presumably require it to know implicitly at least how divide the game world up into objects and how to interact with them.p  pAnd all of this information must be taught to the net... somehow. I cant for the life of me think of how to train this thing. My only idea is have a separate program visually extract something innately goodbad in the game e.g. health, gold, experience from the screen, and then use that stat in a reinforcement learning procedure. I think that will be empartem of the answer, but I dont think itll be enough there are just too many levels of abstraction from raw visual input to goaloriented behavior for such limited feedback to train a net within my lifetime.p  pSo, my question what other ways can you think of to train a net to do at least some part of this task preferably without making thousands of labeled examples...p  pJust for a little more direction Im looking for some other sources of reinforcement learning andor any unsupervised methods for extracting useful information in this setting. Or a supervised algorithm if you can think of a way of getting labeled data out of a game world without having to manually label it.p  pstrongUPDATE042712strongp  pStrangely, Im still working on this and seem to be making progress.

Negative 7496 pIve been experimenting with using named delegates instead of singlemethod interfaces. This has some advantages for code size, as we can go from some linebreaks removed so as not to overstate the casep  precodepublic interface IProductSource      IEnumerableltProductgt GetProducts  public class DataContextProductSource  IProductSource      private readonly DataContext DataContext     public DataContextProductSourceDataContext dataContext              if dataContext  null throw new ArgumentNullExceptiondataContext         DataContext  dataContext          public IEnumerableltProductgt GetProducts              return DataContext.Products.AsEnumerable       codepre  ptop  precodepublic delegate IEnumerableltProductgt DGetProducts public static class DataContextFunctions      public DGetProducts GetProductsDataContext dataContext              if dataContext  null throw new ArgumentNullExceptiondataContext         return  gt dataContext.Products.AsEnumerable       codepre  pThis is basically taking advantage of the fact that once you go far enough with dependency injection, a lot of classes become little more than closures. Those classes can be replaced with functions that return lambdas. Entire sets of related functions that dont need to encapsulate any mutable state, but would have been expressed using classes in standard dependency injection, can then be rolled up into a static class or module in VB parlance.p  pThis is all well and good, but Im having trouble finding the best way to register these static methods with Castle Windsor. Methods with no dependencies are easyp  precodeComponent.ForltDGetIntegersgt.InstanceIntegers.GetOneToTen codepre  pBut our DataContextFunctions.GetProducts from above has some dependencies. The best way Ive found to register this isp  precodeComponent.ForltDGetProductsgt.UsingFactoryMethod     kernel gt DataContextFunctions.GetProductskernel.ResolveltDataContextgt codepre  pThis can get quite verbose, and obviously having to ask the kernel directly for each dependency kind of defeats the point a bit. It seems to me that all the static information that a container should need is available, so it should be possible to do this.p  pThe question is, does Castle Windsor or any other container have a simple way to do this that Ive missed, or are there technical problems that arise, or is it just too niche a use case to have been includedp

Negative 7496 pI have the following query that UNIONs two tables which contains tags associated with two separate entities cat and dog. I am trying to create a table that lists tags and the number of times their appear across two tables. This is a normalized tagging system, so only the tag ID is referenced in the cattags and dogtags tables, and thats why I am doing another INNER JOIN to get the actual tag value.p  precodeSELECT x.tagid, COUNTy.tagid  COUNTz.tagid AS num, tagname AS tag FROM SELECT dt.tagid FROM dogtags dt UNION SELECT st.tagid FROM cattags st x LEFT JOIN dogtags y ON y.tagid  x.tagid LEFT JOIN cattags z ON z.tagid  x.tagid INNER JOIN tags t ON x.tagid  t.tagid GROUP BY x.tagid ORDER BY num DESC LIMIT 0,100 codepre  pThe problem is that the num counts are not correct for tags that appear multiple times across the two tables. For example tag ID number 5 collar appears twice in cattags and twice in dogtags, however the above query gives the total count as 8 instead of 4. Another tag that appears three times comes out as 6. Something is multiplying them by 2. What is itp

Negative 7496 pOkay my assignment is to read in from 2 separate files.  The first file reads in HallOfFameMember and should then be stored in a vector.p  pThe second should read in and then be stored to an array of HallOfFamep  pThe HallOfFameMember object has 10 fields.  In order firstName, lastName, deceased, month born, day born, year born, totalEarned, yearsPlayed, yearInducted, hall of fame idp  pThe daymonthyear born are all going to a separate class to create a date born.  The date born is then set within HallOfFameMember.  The Fields for a record will be separated by varying numbers of spaces andor tabs whitespaces.p  pAfter reading a record from this file, call the 10arg constructor of HallOfFameMember, using the fields from the record as arguments in the constructor call.  Add this new HallOfFameMember object to tempHallOfFameMemberVec.  p  pThe HallOfFame object has 5 fields. In order hallOfFameId, city, costToVisit, numberOfVisitorsPerYear, and name.p  pAfter reading a record from this file, call the 5arg constructor of class HallOfFame, using the arguments obtained from the line in the file.   Add this new HallOfFame object to tempHallOfFameArr.p  pThis is all to be done from the command line.  p  pI know that my current code will not work, I was just trying to figure out some way to do this.

Negative 7496 pI have an activity that contains a single fragment, for reasons I wont go into right now, I handle most configuration changes so that the activity doesnt get recreated when for example the user rotates the screen.  The problem Im running into is that the fragment views dont get recreated when the rotation happens.  The fragment uses the onCreateView method to supply the activity with its view and is added programmatically via the FragmentManager.p  pI call the setContentView method in the activitys onConfigurationChanged method to reload the activities view, however, this never ends up calling the fragments onCreateView method to get a new view appropriate for the newly rotated screen.  That makes sense because the fragment was added manually via the code.  So I tried manually readding the fragment in the activitys onConfigurationChanged method, but still the fragments onCreateView method doesnt get called.  Also I was under the assumption that the Android system automatically handles readding the fragment if you use the Fragment manager transaction system ... but I might be wrong on that.p  pIm assuming Im missing something logic wise.  If anyone could shed some light that would be much appreciated.  Basically I just need to keep my activity and fragment around through configuration changes and need these to recreate their views when these changes happen.p  pThank you for any help, Harryp

Negative 7496 pThis might look like a beaten question, but could not find an answer at SO.p  pI am developing a simple Order Processing application. Quite bit a domain logic so i chose the domain model pattern. Every strongOrderstrong has a strongOrderTypestrong called Ordinary or Express. p  pI have a Order entity and I exposed a int property called OrderTypeID as I thought I could store the OrderTypes Id in that int field. Worked fine, but when I had to retrieve the order, I could populate back the integer Order Type Id, but I need to show the OrderType  Express or Ordinary in the screen. So Order entity when it goes down to persistence goes with Id but when it comes back it should become a text p  pHow do I do this with respect to modelling the Order entity object, should I store the Ordertype as a whole entity may be a OrderType class0, if yes, how will the repository for the Order class split the Ordertype so that i only persist the Idp  pany points would be appreciatedp  pCheers VJp

Negative 7496 pI have been looking at MapReduce and reading through various papers about it and applications of it, but, to me, it seems that MapReduce is only suitable for a very narrow class of scenarios that ultimately result in wordcounting.p  pIf you look at the a hrefhttpstatic.googleusercontent.comexternalcontentuntrusteddlcpresearch.google.comenarchivemapreduceosdi04.pdf relnofolloworiginal papera Googles employees provide various potential use cases, like distributed grep, distributed sort, reverse weblink graph, termvector per host, etc. But if you look closer, all those problems boil down to simply counting words  that is counting the number occurrences of something in a chunk of data, then aggregatingfiltering  and sorting that list of occurrences.p  pThere also are some cases where MapReduce has been used for genetic algorithms or relational databases, but they dont use the vanilla MapReduce published by Google. Instead they introduce further steps along the MapReduce chain, like MapReduceMerge, etc.p  pDo you know of any other documented scenarios where vanilla MapReduce has been used to perform more than mere wordcounting Maybe for raytracing, videotranscoding, cryptography, etc.  in short anything computation heavy that is parallelizablep

Negative 7496 pDownloaded the a hrefhttpwww.prothemer.comblogresearchanddevelopmentnewjqueryplugintargetingusabilityforpasswordmaskingonforms relnofollowshowPassword jQuery plugina that enables a check box to mask and unmask a password field.

Negative 7496 pI am using JSF 2.1, EJB 3.1, JPA 2.0, Glassfish 3.1.1 and NetBeans 7.0.1.p  pFor each entity class I created a separate Facade class, for example, UserFacade and AddressFacade using NetBeans tools. These two entities are not related to each other and are completely independent of each of other. However, I need to put them into database during one transaction and if one fails to be inserted then another one should also be rollbacked. How can I do that As far as I know EJB container manages transactions itself and doesnt allow to manually control the transaction boundaries.p

Negative 7496 pIm building a database scheme for two different headquarters. Each location uses the same datascheme, but has its own data. Both will have access to the same location, a shared network folder where the corresponding accessbackend will be placed. Both will also use an equal FrontEnd, where depending on the useraccount the specific data will be shown. Each location will have two main tables which will grow by 40005000 records per year.p  pMost of the time each location only uses its own data, but once every week or so a third party will access some aggregated data from both locations. p  pIn my opinion there are two possibilities to organize the data a shared approach, where both locations use amp work with the same tables, where a field indicates whether the current data belongs to location 1 or 2. sA huge problem I see is the amount of data which would be transferred through the network roughly doubled, because as far as I know access runs the select statements locally, after transferring the data.s I stand corrected. Besides that an additional query would be neccessary for each access.p  pThe alternative would be to create a second set of tables for the second location and keep them separated e.g. renaming them to loc1tablex andor create a second backendfile, which also would make a backup easy.p  pI would prefer the second approach, because I cant really see any downside to it. It would be faster and in my opinion cleaner. p  pDid I miss anything importing or would this approach be reasonablep  pEditp  pAfter discussing the topic further we also got some new information from our client, we decided to store the data in one backend and in the same tables. The table structure is fully equal and we are using a location id to control what data belongs to which location first approach. Ty for shedding some light on the access backend, I had a lack of information there and learned a lotp

Negative 7496 pI use a OleDb data reader to read a number of records, and then write them to a CSV. I then read from this CSV using codeFile.ReadAllLinescode, then split on commas to get my data. The problem is some parts of the CSV include a character I cant display shows up as a square, which appears to act as a line break  this line break corrupts the CSV, so I need to get rid of it.p  pIve tried replacing codeEnvironment.NewLinecode with something else a blank space when writing the CSV, and ditto with codercode and codencode but to no avail  the character isnt replaced. What other ways are there to remove thesep
Negative 7496 pIm migrating an ASP.NET web forms application to ASP.NET MVC 3. I kind of understand routing, but I sort of dont. In my application, I have created three .cshtml files in the directory located at internalproductsfind. For the sake of demonstration, those .cshtml files are named view1.cshtml, view2.cshtml, and view3.cshtml. p  pI have a controller named InternalController. My goal is to use InternalController for all of the locations inside the internal path. Im not sure if what Im trying to do is allowed. I assume it is.

Negative 7496 pI was planning to interface the native API exposed by OpenGL ES 2.0 using SWIG.p  pI know there is JOGL, but somehow it has too many abstractions, classes and code.p  pAll I want is a very bare minimum and simple Java API to interface with OpenGL ES 2.0 and EGL application. Finally my app will use SWT. SWIG can be used to generate the Java interface using the C API exposed by OpenGL ES 2.0 and EGL.p  pWith regards to EGL I simply have to extract the currentwindow handle of the java window and pass on to EGL, would this workp  pHas someone already tried this out or it isnt as simple as it seemsand that is the reason we have to use JOGLp

Negative 7496 pI created an app for iPad which lets you navigare through some presentations... there are two views The list of presentations and the view which shows you the presentation. When a user selects a presentation in PresentationListController, I show the presentation in the other view PresentationViewController. The PresentationViewController contains a UIScrollView with a list of pages... the problem is that after some time, without a recurring event which causes this problem, the UIScrollView loses its capacity to bounce... so the scrolling is not smooth and its like scrolling a rigid view without that fancy bounce effect... The user is still able to scroll but the effect is very ugly. The problem is that, the problem remains even if I go back the the PresentationListController and select a new PresentationViewController... the new presentation which is shown, have this problem. I thought it was due to the fact that the navigationcontroller kept the UIView in memory and reused it whenever I opened a new presentation, but this is not the case because I debugged and saw that when I change the presentation, the dealloc method is called on the PresentationViewController.p  pSo, how can I manage this problemp  pemstrongEDITemstrong p  pI found how to reproduce it I am doing an animiation to open the list of pages, and an animation to close it. When I open a presentation which contains lots of pages so that the contentSize of the UIScrollView  the width of the UIScrollView, I get no problem.

What is missing is support for further JSFspecific scopes, and that I always get a LazyInitializationException when iterating over collections within a JSF page.

Is this a better alternative to Seam Faces As far as I can see, it offers a ViewScope and ViewAccessScope, but nothing with regard to transaction management.pli ol  pIt would be great if someone with more experience in this field could shed some light on this  I am currently a bit confused because there are so many libraries out there dealing with similar issues, albeit most apparently not compatible with each other see e.g. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma7829052herea.

After all of the sockets data has been transmitted the sockets data is empty and embytesRead  0em, the Waithandle is removed and the application continues processing.  p  pUnfortunately, by steppingthrough the execution of the code, it appears that after the last time that the client returns data from the remote device, emReceiveCallbackem never returns to see if the dataqueue is empty i.e. bytesRead  0, and thus never enters the emelseem condition in emReceiveCallbackem where the state of the strongemManualResetEventemstrong would have been reset and the application would have continued to process.  Thus, since it never enters the emelseem condition, emManualResetEventem is never reset and the application freezes.p  pAlthough I can remove the receiveDone.WaitOne method from the code  permitting execution without waiting for the emManualResetEventsem notification that all of the data has been received this returns a datastring from the equipment that is typically incomplete.  p  pAm I using this code sample incorrectly  Has anyone seen this before or had any experience on how to workaround this issue p  pstrong7142012  UPDATEstrong After further testing of the MSDNs a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarybew39x2a relnofollowAsynchronous Client Socket Examplea, it became clear that emReceiveCallbackem actually repolls the port and the bytesRead  0 condition is satisfied only emwhen the socket is releasedem i.e. emclient.ShutdownSocketShutdown.Both client.Closeem .  If I understand this correctly, this means that the connection has to be closed to get past the receiveDone.WaitOne method. If the connection is closed to satisfy the WaitOne Waithandle, it totally defeats the purpose of the application in that I had been hoping to leave the connection open so that the application could listen for equipment updates, which happen continually. p  pstrong7162012  UPDATEstrong I have written to strongMicrosoft Tech Supportstrong who have responded that strongema hrefhttpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumsenUScsharplanguagethreade94d6348ce274779813039367aaeb2bc relnofollowWere doing research on this issue. It might take some time before we get back to you.aemstrong  As such, it seems that it doesnt appear that this challenge can be resolved at this time through massaging this code.  p  pemWithout the availability of the Asynchronous Client Socket example code as a foundation for writing asynchronous communication procedures, may I ask if anyone can please suggest a replacement routine that is more reliableem  There are three pieces of equipment, each with its own ipaddress and port number.  Thus, it would be ideal if a class could be utilized, where an instance could be created for each device.  Additionally, the port must remain open to receive spontaneous updates continually sent by the equipment.  Lastly, the updates do not have a end character or defined length signalling that the transmission of the message is complete, thus the routine must continually poll the port for available data.  strongemAny advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.emstrongp  pstrong7182012  WORKAROUNDstrong After spending a considerable amount of time attempting to get the strongMSDNs Asynchronous Client Socketstrong code sample working, it became clear that I would have to look elsewhere to get the device responses continuously recognized by the program.  In the hope to save someone else the braindamage, I have included the workaround that I used which seems to work well to this point.

Negative 7496 pSuppose theres a sensor which records the date and time at every activation. I have this data stored as a list in a .json file in the format e.g.  20000101T0030150000. p  pNow, what I want to do is import this file in python and use NumPy Mathplotlib to plot how many times this sensor is activated per day. p  pMy problem is, using this data, I dont know how to write an algorithm which counts how many times the sensor is activated daily. This should be simple, but due to limited Python knowledge, Im stuck. Supposedly there is a way to split this list wrt T, bin each recording by date e.g. 20000101 and then count the recordings on this date. p  pHow would you count how many times the sensor is activated to then make a plot showing the number of activations each dayp

Negative 7496 pIm having troubles with sqlite inserts performance even with transactions. My android app receives approximately 23.000 rows from a web service and I have to insert them into a single table.p  pThe web service is partitioned so that I receive about 2000 rows in every request to the WS and I wrap the 2000 inserts within a transaction. After those inserts are done I send the new request to the WS and again use a new transaction for the new 2000 rows.p  pAt the beginning it works fine. It does a lot of inserts per second. but with the time it gets slower and finally ends up with 4 or 3 inserts per second until it completes the 23000 rows.p  pIs there a problem with the size of the table When it gets bigger the inserts get slower Is there any way to improve the performance for that large amount of datap  pThanks for your help.p

Negative 7496 pIm working on an existing application that is going through UI changes and Im trying to move the search box functionality to the client.  As it is currently, the search box has a search button that OnClick triggers a server side method that looks at the text in the search box sets it to a query string of the search results url and redirects to that url.  Because the data in the search box is sensitive the query string value is encrypted server side before redirecting.  p  pThe existing code is like thisp  precodeltaspTextBox IDtxtSecretSearch runatserver PlaceholderSecret Searchgt ltaspButton IDbtnSearch TextSearch OnClickbtnSearchClick runatserver gt  protected void btnSearchClickobject sender, EventArgs e        iftxtSecretSearch.Text.ToLower  secret search ampamp string.IsNullOrEmptytxtSecretSearch.Text         Response.RedirectSecretSearchResults.aspxsecret  Encryption.EncryptForQueryStringtxtSecretSearch.Text     else         Response.RedirectSecretSearchResults.aspx  codepre  pNow the new UI design eliminates the search button.

Negative 7496 pI have a query with the fields    codedatecode codehourcode and codevaluecode.br It looks something like thisp  precode    date       hour   value      xxxxxx     15     100     xxxxxx     30     122     xxxxxx     45      50     ...         100     100     ...         115      23     ...         ...     ...     ...         ...     ...     ...        2400     400     ...          15      23 codepre  pBasically, codedatecode is the date, codehourcode is the hour, and codevaluecode is the value for that particular 15 minute interval.  What I have been trying to figure out is a way to take each hour so 15, 30, 45, and 100 or 1015, 1030, 1045, 1100 [As you can see hours are militaryesque 100pm is 1300 and midnight 2400], and sum their values together.  So i am looking to return something like thisp  precode    xxxxxx    100     372     xxxxxx    200     23  130 data  145 data  200 data codepre  pAnd so on... The table has on average around 100 days and they all start from 15 to 2400 incrementing by 15 with varying numbers for the value column.p  pI have thought about using a partition, group by, etc. with no real ideas how to tackle it. Essentially I have to take 4 rows an hour, sum their values, spit out the date, hour, and summed value then repeat for every day.  I am not asking for code, just some help with what i should be using since this seems like a simple problem minus the key to solving it.p  pAny help is greatly appreciated, Thank youp

Negative 7496 pIm working on debugging a game written in C and it recently started hanging on the splash screen when I try to run it in Xcode in Debug mode. I cant identify any changes in my code that could have caused this, and there arent any log messages being printed while this hang is happening something that I know can severely slow down a program. I then opened Instruments and used the time profiler to try and find the source of the problem, but when I ran my program on the time profiler it progressed past the part where it hangs, and ran as expected. Both running and profiling are set to use Debug mode so the build is the same, does anyone know what could possibly cause an issue like thisp  pMore info Im using LLVMClang as the compiler and LLDB as the debugger. Looking at Activity Monitor during the hang I can see the game is shown as not responding and Xcode is using a lot of CPU activity, despite not printing any log messages etc.. In Edit Schemes the Profile scheme is set to use the Run actions arguments and environment variables.p

Negative 7496 pThis is actually a memory training app, with matrix of squares wich flips to their other side and than back to first side. And user need to click on squares that flipped. You know what I mean img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comQTcHV.png altenter image description herep  pSomething like that.p  pWhat I need is that sizes of the matrix would change dynamically. If user have been passed one level of complexity matrix size is 4x4 for example, then matrix size would grow 5x5 for example, and if not then matrix size would get smaller 3x3 for example. I hope thats clear, and if not  sorry, English is not my native language p  pSo if I would do it from code this would not be a problem. I would use ViewFlipper with some transition animation and create TableView with sizes that I want with inflater or something like that or directly from code without using xml at all. And then adding it to ViewFlipper from code.p  pBut somehow I dont like that idea.p  pThen next idea come into my mind. To do ViewFlipper with all possible tableviews in it and then just showNext or showPrevious depending on what user have done. But in this case XML would be of very great size.p  pSo maybe someone knows the another way to do itp
Negative 7496 pAs part of a class project I am looking at ways to improve the performance of a path finding algorithm in a CPU architecture. The algorithm is implemented in C. The basic operation is to read x,y coordinates and perform some operations on them. p  pThe idea I have right now is to store x and y coordinates separately in two cache banksset associative. Two coordinates entered for a location should be stored in different banks such that it should be able to read them both in parallel and do separate operations on x and y coordinates and store the combined result. By using vector operations this process can be further sped up to read up to 4 x coordinates and 4 y coordinates at the same time.p  pFor example, for computing euclidean distance from the goal node, at each location the x and y coordinates has to be read and subtracted from goal coordinates to find out the distance.p  pI wish to know if there is an effective waycache placement policy to keep x and y coordinates in different cache linesblocks for taking advantage of parallelism. Is there any operationencoding of coordinates I can use to implement it p  pP.S I am not looking for software optimizations but for a modified cache designtheoretical to speed up the algorithm. p  pRef This a hrefhttpigoro.comarchivegalleryofprocessorcacheeffects relnofollowblog posta mentions that L1 cache can process two accesses in parallel if they access cache lines from different banks, and serially if they belong to the same bank.p

Negative 7496 pArgh. Having trouble here trying to work out how to build my array in Ruby. p  pSo I am looping through a result and I want to add the category field as the key and have it so that if the next row has the same category it gets put into that category. If not, it makes a new array and adds it to that. p  pHere is what I have so far. p  precodedata  Array.new results.each do row    data[row.category].push row.field end codepre  pWhich is not going to work I know. I want codedata[row.category]code to eventually be after the loop an array containing all the coderow.fieldcodesp  pSo I end up with an array that looks like this. p  precode[[Dogs, 5, 12, 2], [Cats, 4, 5, 9], [Fish, 25, 82, 23]] codepre  pSo no matter how many loops I do, if I push it into an array that already exists in data then it just appends it, if the array doesnt exist it creates it and then appends it. p  pIn PHP I would simply do thisp  precodedata[row[category]][]  row[field] codepre  pWith the empty [] denoting to create a new array if there is none.

Negative 7496 pI am using BIRT to generate PDF reports that contain graphs of data and a table of the data. I have TestNG unit tests that create a BIRT PDF and then I want to compare the created PDF with a baseline report. I cant use an MD5 hash because each report is timestamped in the footer and the timestamps always changes. I tried using PDPage and PDResources to get all the images from the PDF but the graphs dont seem to be images bc the call to getImages from the PDResources object returns 0 images. Using PDFBox what are other elements of the PDF that I can grab and compare with the baseline PDF to verify equality The format of the PDF is as follows, page 1 will contain a Title, a start datetime label, an end datetime label, a report note, followed by one or more graphs, followed by 1 table.p

Negative 7496 pI have a question regarding the reuse of code among controller actions. I think it is a fairly standard situation, so I am interested in whats the best practice in Rails.p  pLets say I have a codefilmscode resource with a corresponding codeFilmsControllercode, which has a nested resource codecommentscode served by codeCommentsControllercode. The nested resource can be rendered on its own using its codeindexcode and codeshowcode actions. However, it should also be possible to render the comments embedded in the corresponding film page.p  pNow, the question goes, what is the best way to reuse the code from codeCommentsControllercode within codeFilmsController.showcodep  p1 Force the codeCommentsController.indexcode to render to a string and then pass it in a variable to the film viewp  pOr 2 call the codeCommentsController.indexcode directly in the film view as a kind of partial, executing the database queries from there p  pOr 3 create a separate method in codeCommentsControllercode responsible for the database handling, call it from both codeCommentsController.indexcode and codeFilmsController.showcode, and use the corresponding view in both the places, toop  pTo me the options 1 and 2 seem a bit messy, while 3 is not modular and involves some repeating of code. Is there any better way to accomplish thisp  pThanks a lotp

Negative 7496 pHeres the situation. I have two WCF services, 1 is a BizTalk service, the other is a plain ol WCF service used for querying a data repository. I have a test application that has service references added to both of these services. Im using HL7v3 schemas for passing data to and from both of these services.p  pIt appears the BizTalk WCF proxy classes get generated using codeSystem.Xml.Serializationcode but the other nonBizTalk proxy comes across with everything using codeSystem.Runtime.Serializationcode. p  pI can deserialize fine using the BizTalk proxy classes, but not so using the other.

Negative 7496 pIm exploring the options for building a bleeding edge whiteboard application much like Big Blue Button or Wimba using webRTC, HTML5, socket.io and node.js.  This would be for oneonone communication ... no more than two users communicating with each other at a time.p  pId like use data channels to pass whiteboard data between clients, then have some sort of listener on the server end that can record the videoaudiowhiteboard actions.  The server listeners would in effect be wiretapping the whiteboardaudiovideo chat.  In other words, if the server to client connection gets laggy, it would not affect the quality of the P2P clienttoclient webRTC connection.  This way the server can record the whiteboard interactions at a lower priority leaving the oneonone chat interactions as high speed as possible.p  pAre there any libraries or javascript frameworks that would work well for a shared whiteboard that I should know aboutp

Negative 7496 pHeres a head scratcher...at least for me I have a contact list that displays a list of contacts from my Db. When a user clicks on one of the contacts an edit activity comes up. It all works perfectly as laid out currently, but I need to have the edit activity display the last name entry before the first name. Thinking that all the fields should have a one to one relationship, I went ahead and moved the editTextXML for the last name above the first name in the edit activity thinking that this should be referenced by the id of the EditText. After doing so, the program is now displaying the first name in the last name field and viseversa. I have tried wiping the user data on the emulator with no difference. I already realize this is probably one of those UHDUH type questions, but if anyone can point out the obvious for me, it would be appreciated.

Negative 7496 pI have an untemplated functor object that Im trying to store as a codestdfunctioncode inside another object.

Negative 7496 pIn my core data model I have an entity with an attribute of type Date. The date is stored by core data as a timeInterval since x. x being a reference date that core data uses. The problem is that the dates where entered manually as actual date strings instead of time intervals I know the data should not be directly manipulated. My question therefore is Is there a way I can directly get the data as a string as it is stored by core data ValueForKey keeps returning a default date which is 20010101 003320 0000 because it is failing to convert the data stored into an NSDate object. I do not want to change the attribute type from Date to String for a particular reason. Thank youp

Ive got a simple standalone hello world app writing to UART0 that I can load through UBoot so far, and now Im trying to move on to interrupt handlers, but I cant get SWI to do anything but hang the device.p  pAccording to the AM335x TRM starting on page 4099, if youre interested, the interrupt vector table is mapped in ROM at 0x20000. The ROM SWI handler branches to RAM at 0x4030ce08, which branches to the address stored at 0x4030ce28. Initially, this is a unique dead loop at 0x20084.p  pMy code sets up all the ARM processor modes SP to their own areas at the top of RAM, and enables interrupts in the CPSR, then executes an SWI instruction, which always hangs. Perhaps jumping to some deadloop instruction Ive looked at a bunch of samples, and read whatever documentation I could find, and I dont see what Im missing.p  pCurrently my only interaction with the board is over serial connection on UART0 with my linux box.

Im wondering it that is better thanp  precodeif paused     pausedmutex.lock     wait for condition pausedmutex dowork codepre  pOr is there a better solutionp  pI guess one downside of doing it with the semaphore is that the main thread will block until all workers release.

The whilenot quit loop quits when the file has been successfully copied.

If not, rails throws an error saying use get or post and not match. Is netzke compatible with rails 4.0 How can I resolve it Or should I use older version of rails for this to work.p
Negative 7496 pIm looking for considerations that I need to make and known pitfalls when designing a grid for a strongWebappstrong so not necessarily typographical or webdesign grids. p  pIm specifically interested in what the considerations arise from moving a desktop app to the web. Is there any documentation out there for oldschool desktop application grids I couldnt find any.p  pAll my searches have led me to all known CSS frameworks Bootstrap, Foundation, Semantic, Unsematic, 960, etc. which are useful for designing websites, and ecommerce sites, but not directly for creating highly intricate onepage webapps that require quite a bit more than a 12 column fluid grid. p  pE.g. has anyone ever built their own 160col grid where you can switch seamlessly between a guttered and nonguttered modep  pAny previous bodies of work or experiences would also be appreciated. Thanks in advance.p  pCheers, Allardp

I downloaded a trial copy of VS2010 pro and created a VSTO addin. p  pAfter creating the addin, it was time to package it for a small test deployment. Thats when I found out that this is a much more difficult thing to do. It seems MS does not ship Office 2010 with the runtime needed to run VSTO, so id have to package that as well. In a company environment, this is not something simple to do. p  pSo, I might have to go back to the drawing board. p  pstrongMeat of the questionstrongp  pIve never created an addin for office before, I really want more of a drop in solution.

Right now, if there is no record, the code is still displaying a blank list item, when I just want nothing to appear.p  pI have tried thisp  precodeltphp do  gt     ltligtlta hrefgtContent Goes Hereltagtltligt ltphp  while feofrecordsetName ampamp rowrecordsetName  mysqlfetchassocrecordsetName gt codepre  pAnd I have tried doing it this way by putting the repeating element withing an ifelse statement like thisp  precodeltphp if feofrecordsetName      echo   else do  gt     ltligtlta hrefgtContent Goes Hereltagtltligt ltphp  while rowrecordsetName  mysqlfetchassocrecordsetName   gt codepre  pBut that isnt working either.

As each file is uploaded, a request is sent to the server to retrieve the file and build the display.  Once the user is satisfied that the display looks good, they can commit the new data to the database.p  pThe problem I am having I that SpringMVC seems to lose the session object on the last call to the server.

Negative 7496 pIm fairly experienced with opengl and GLSL. For my engine I wanted to implement deferred lighting, knowing it was not going to be a trivial task. After a few hours I was able to get things mostly working. Here is a screenshot of all the buffers Ive renderedp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.com9kq2p.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com9kq2p.png altenter image description herea The upper left is the normals, the upper right is the albedo, the lower left is the position and the lower right is the final render. There is only one light being rendered right now. I use various shaders to render all the things to a frame buffer. I had previously used a forward rendering lighting shader. To hopefully provide the same results, I used the same data from that vertex shader to render the different buffers. The light source moves and changes based on the position of my camera, unlike my forward renderer. Here is the code for the vertex shaders the fragment ones just render the pixels they got from the vertex onep  pPosition shaderp  precodevarying vec4 pos void mainvoid      glPosition glModelViewProjectionMatrixglVertex     pos  glModelViewMatrixglVertex  codepre  pNormal shaderp  precodevarying vec3 normal void mainvoid       glPosition glModelViewProjectionMatrixglVertex     normal  normalizeglNormalMatrixglNormal  codepre  pFor the albedo I just use opengls regular shader and just bind textures.p  pHere is the final light shader which is being rendered as a quad over the screenp  precodeuniform sampler2D positionMap uniform sampler2D normalMap uniform sampler2D albedoMap varying vec2 texcoord uniform mat4 matrix void main      vec3 position  vec3texture2DpositionMap,texcoord     vec3 normal  vec3texture2DnormalMap,texcoord      vec3 L  normalizeglLightSource[0].position.xyz  position     float l  lengthL5.0     float att  1.0lll      render sun light     vec4 diffuselight  maxdotnormal,L, 0.0vec4att,att,att,att     diffuselight  clampdiffuselight, 0.0, 1.02.0     vec4 amb  vec4.2,.2,.2,0      vec4 texture  texture2DalbedoMap,texcoord      glFragColor   diffuselightambtexture   codepre  pThis has a lot of functions that are referenced elsewhere, but I think you can get the general basis from the pictures and the code.

In my implementation, the code to update the local widget variables is around 10 lines. p  pWhat is the reason Please help, thanks.p  hr  pSOLVED.p  pThanks to charlietfl and BeetrootBeetroot. I found that the problem is not caused by the javascript. It is because that simultaneous queries to MySQL make the connection failed.p

Negative 7496 pCreated a simple access DB with only 1 form and 1 one button to run code that opens an existing empty excel with 1 worksheet and writes X in its 1st cell.

Negative 7496 pI am working on a javascript capable screenscraper using capybaradsl, selienium webdriver, and the spreadsheet gem. Very close to the desired output however two major problems arisep  ol lipI have not been able to figure out the exact xpath selector to filter out only the elements Im looking for to ensure that none are missing I am using a broad selector that I know will produce duplicate elements.

Maybe Im not using it properly coderesults  alla[containsonclick, analyticsLog].uniqcode. I know that the xpath that I have chosen to extract hrefs codea[containsonclick, analyticsLog]code will define more nodes than I intended because using find to inspect the page elements shows 144 rather than 72 that make up the page results. I have looked for a more specific selector however I havent been able to find one without filtering out some desired links due to the business logic used on the site.pli lipMy saveitem method has two selectors that are not always found within the info results, I would like the script to just skip those that arent found and save only the ones that are however my current iteration will throw a CapybaraElementNotFound and exit.

Negative 7496 pIm currently building a website using only HTMLCSS3. It displays perfectly on all desktop browsers but not in mobile Safari which is crucial. The site is currently under construction here test.scccjapan.com and the problem is with the drop down navigation menu blackboard  grammar  verbs list.p  pThe list is particularly long, but when scrolling down the page to get to the bottom of the list, the menu closes making it impossible to click on any of the links.p  pAfter a lot of trial and error, I seem to have narrowed the problem down to the overflowscroll attribute.

Negative 7496 pIm relatively new to Android, and working on an app that will load bitmaps into a dynamically created layout with an ImageView. The number of layouts and ImageViews is based on some dynamic data i.e. an API call. I want to load Bitmaps into these ImageViews after they have been dynamically created and add them to the main layout. Since I will be creating multiple dynamic layouts and loading multiple bitmaps this cant be done synchronously on the main thread. Im currently using a solution based on AsyncTasks but Im thinking there might be a more efficient method possibly using HandlerRunnable.p  pCurrently, I have implemented a solution that uses AsyncTasks in the following way p  p1 Launch the first AsyncTask from the main threadp  precodeforEvent event  events.getEventList     Create an UpdateCalendarUITask to update the UI   CalendarUpdateTask calendarTask  new CalendarUpdateTaskthis, parentView   calendarTask.executeevent  codepre  p2 Create and populate the layout adding Text and Image views, add the newly created dynamic view to the layout, and call back to the main thread on completion using an interface.p  precodepublic class CalendarUpdateTask extends AsyncTaskltEvent, Void, RelativeLayoutgt     private final WeakReferenceltActivitygt activityReference   private final WeakReferenceltViewGroupgt parentViewReference   ....   public CalendarUpdateTaskContext context, ViewGroup parentView      parentViewReference  new WeakReferenceltViewGroupgtparentView     activityReference  new WeakReferenceltActivitygtActivity context       Override   protected RelativeLayout doInBackgroundEvent... params      myEvent  params[0]     return updateGameViewmyEvent  returns created RelativeLayout       Override   protected void onPostExecuteRelativeLayout result      super.onPostExecuteresult      Add the GameEvent view to the Events View     if  Reference and nulls checks           ViewGroup parentView  parentViewReference.get                     parentView.addViewresult         TaskListener listener  TaskListener activityReference.get         listener.loadImagesmyEvent           ....      codepre  p3 The listener function loadImages... launches another AsyncTask that loads the bitmaps similar to a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comtrainingdisplayingbitmapsprocessbitmap.html relnofollowthisap  pThis works ok. However, it is still a little slow loading lots of images because bitmaps arent loaded until after the views is created. I cant call it before because I dont have a reference to the ImageView until after it is created. I cant launch the second AsyncTask from CalendarUpdateTask because it must always be launched from the main thread.p  pIdeally I would prefer to launch both operations at the same time and have a callback that is notified once both operations are done so that the bitmap can be loaded into the new ImageView.p  pThere has to be a better option correct Thanks in advance.p

Negative 7496 pTrying to plot the output of some codeData.Array.Acceleratecode computations with codegnuplotcode I encountered a strange problem.

Negative 7496 pIn JavaScript, I have an object.  Changes to that object are being tracked Im using AngularJS.p  pIn my Service in AngularJS, I am getting an updated version of that object.  I dont know what has changed about it, I dont know the model of this object, I just know thatp  p1 These two objects have the same model Although arrays within the model may have increased or decreased in sizep  p2 If I change the reference of my old object to the new one, AngularJS will understandably not be able to update the front end to reflect the new object, because all of the watches on the old object just broke.p  pSo, I thought Well, I will just copy all of the values from the updated object over to the new one   This works remarkably well.  however, I am having trouble getting my formula just right, So I thought I would ask for a bit of help.  note that these are complex objects of an unknown, albeit identical, modelp  precode var makeEqual  functionoriginalObject, updatedObject     for var key in originalObject          if typeof originalObject[key]  object             ampamp originalObject.hasOwnPropertykey              makeEqualoriginalObject[key], updatedObject[key]                  else             originalObject[key]  updatedObject[key]                       codepre  pHowever, so far I have the following problem.  If codeupdateObjectcode is an array, new elements will not be added. deleted elements wont be removed, either I think, not sure about that.  Note that the array could be an array of child objects.p  pTo be honest, I feel like there are toher problems that this might have other than what I have detected myself, so I ask  How can I create this deep copy to an existing object function work perfectly p

Negative 7496 pI know this question has been asked several times and i saw some solutions here on Stackoverflow, but after trying every possible problem solving tips out i still could not get a hang of my error. i tried to uninstall from my Package Manager but it seems i have 2types of .Net Entity Framework in one project. 4.5 and 6.0. After trying to uninstall either of them it says Unable to uninstall EntityFramework 6.0.2 because EntityFramework.Extras 0.9.4.0, EntityFramework.SqlServerCompact 6.0.2 depend on it.

Negative 7496 pI have a JUnit test where I am testing a method with null arguments. If the argument arguments are null, then I would throw a NullPointerException. The method by itself will just throw an IOException. I am using doThrow on mock object of the class  but it seems to me that I am losing the exception in the doThrow construct and I am unable to catch it. Additionally, I strictly do not want to use a try catch in my unit tests. So I am using Rules for the same. Here is the code snippetp  precodepublic class TableTest   Rule public ExpectedException exception  ExpectedException.none private static Table spyTable  Test public void testCreateTableWithNullTableNamethrowsIOEXception throws IOException      final String tableName  null     mockConfig  mockConfiguration.class     spyPersonTable  spynew PersonTable     doThrownew IllegalArgumentException.whenspyPersonTable.createTabletableName, mockConfig      exception.expectIllegalArgumentException.class  codepre  pUsing the rules exception object, If I use the commented line to catch my exception, the exception created in the doThrow construct will be lost and I cannot catch it. My unit test will fail and complain thatp  precodeExpected test to throw an instance of java.lang.IllegalArgumentException codepre  pThe test works fine if I the line is commented as I have it. Here is how my method looks like that I am trying to testp  precodepublic void createTablefinal String tableName, final Configuration config throws IOException  codepre  pThe method needs to throw IOException since the specific exception thrown during table creation is a subclass of IOException. p  pIs my catching of exception in the JUnit test wrong for this type of checking exception.p

Each time the the add item button is clicked, the event calls this function to add the item to the list. Everything works beautifully UNTIL I try to add the eventListener to the x that is appended to the li element prior to the list item text. The idea is that the x is clickable, and onClick it removes the list item entry from the list. But I have tried 6 ways to Sunday to attach an eventListener to the x object and nothing works. I have tried attaching the event listener to a span object, and a button object I have moved remex.addEventListener... all around in the function, after it has been rendered, before it gets rendered, etc. I have eliminated the css I have tried changing the addEventListener to onClick I have tried this code on our own apache server, I have moved it to jsbin.com in hopes that some server setting was getting in my way and probably a few more things I cant remember in the long list of things I have tried. As you see, I have tried it as a button and as a span, hence the commented code. p  pIn short, no matter what I try, the eventListener will NOT attach to the x. Any ideas Do you need to see more of the codep

Negative 7496 pI have been wondering about this for a while, and it might already be implemented in codegnuplotcode but I havent been able to find info online.p  pWhen you have a data file, it is possible to exchange the axes and assign the dummy variable, say x, in gnuplots help terminology to the vertical axisp  precodeplot data u 12  x goes to horizontal axis, standard plot data u 21  x goes to vertical axis, exchanged axes codepre  pHowever, when you have a function, you need to resort to a parametric function to do this.

Negative 7496 pIm working with a large dataset of human gene expression values throughout the full x, y, z MRI coordinates of the brain. Since there are 60,000 genes in the human genome, and the researchers looked for the expression values of each gene in each of 1000 samples that were taken, I need a way of storing a large number of columns in a database. p  pI am currently using a Node Module called pg for Postgresql with express, and I have 2 of my 3 tables set up already tables 1 and 3 below. However for the second data set 60,000 is more than the number of columns that can be used in such a DB. I have considered using each gene represented by a probe ID as an entry in the table, and each of the 1000 samples as columns, but I would have to create names for the columns with dynamicallyassigned identifiers. In addition, using the genes as columns and the samples as entries seems to be the more logical way to organize the data.p  pWould a keyvalue store or a NoSql DB such as Mongo provide me with the ability to store more columns 60,000  one for each genes expression as properties of a sample schemaJSON object p  pThe available data consists ofp  ol liThe Probes.csv file, which lists each Microarray probes details such as its corresponding genes name and the unique ID value for that gene which I plan to use simply to map a text input of the genes name, to the probe ID that is used in the other CSV files.li liThe ExprVals.csv file, which lists the expression values for each probe, currently listed with probe IDs as rows, and expression values as columns. These columns are ordered to match the order of the rows in the next file, which lists the coordinates of each sample for which the expression value was taken. Above I mentioned that I would like to flip this table, so that the rows correspond to samples from the next file, and columns correspond to each probe ID, but Ive not done this yet.li liThe Samples.csv file, which lists each sample with a unique sample ID, and the voxel coordinates of that sample, ordered to match the order of the columns in ExprVals.csv.li ol  pThus, the queries that I would like to be able to make arep  ol liA query of the Probes.csv table with a gene name, to get the ID values of the probes that correspond to it.li liA query of the ExprVals.csv table with a probe ID, to get the list of expression values for that probe.li liA query of the Samples.csv file for each listed expression value in the previous query, that returns the voxel coordinates of that that sample.li ol  pThe end goal of this process is to be able to input a genes name and get out a list of expression values for each voxel.p

Negative 7496 pSo a while back I decided to redo one of my models in Laravel completely, but I wanted to hold on to the original copy of the file just in case. So I renamed it to something like MyModel OLD.php and left it there in the models folder next to the new model.p  pNow that I understand Laravel a bit better, I realize that wasnt a great idea, but in any case everything seemed to work for months. Then today, I made a minor update modifying a database query to one of the functions in my new model and suddenly Laravel is trying to load the old copy of my model. I finally moved the old copy out of the models folder and into a backup folder completely outside of my laravel application, but now Laravel throws the errorp  precodeincludepathToMyModelsMyModel OLD.php failed to open stream No such file or directory codepre  preferring to this section of ClassLoader.phpp  precode  Scope isolated include.

Negative 7496 pI need to implement forms with a saveyourwork as well as a submit button. The user needs to be able to save their work before it is complete.

This approach was also attempted here a hrefhttpscommunity.jboss.orgthread211982tstart0ampsscct relnofollowhttpscommunity.jboss.orgthread211982tstart0ampssccta. Cleaner because only one change is needed in the form to indicate which button should skip validation using the buttons id. More secure because one is not adding a parameter to the request that is potentially manipulated and whose purpose is to bypass validation The goal is to replace the base validator so the custom validator can detect which button is clicked and skip validation on the entire page.p  pThe facesconfig.xml isp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gt ltfacesconfig version2.2     xmlnshttpxmlns.jcp.orgxmlnsjavaee     xmlnsxsihttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemainstance     xsischemaLocationhttpxmlns.jcp.orgxmlnsjavaee httpxmlns.jcp.orgxmlnsjavaeewebfacesconfig22.xsdgt  ltapplicationgt      ltdefaultvalidatorsgt         ltvalidatoridgtjavax.faces.Beanltvalidatoridgt     ltdefaultvalidatorsgt     ltdefaultvalidatorsgt         ltvalidatoridgtjavax.faces.Requiredltvalidatoridgt     ltdefaultvalidatorsgt ltapplicationgt  ltvalidatorgt     ltvalidatoridgtjavax.faces.Beanltvalidatoridgt     ltvalidatorclassgtedu.wustl.mir.ctt.util.SkipBeanValidatorltvalidatorclassgt ltvalidatorgt ltvalidatorgt     ltvalidatoridgtjavax.faces.Requiredltvalidatoridgt     ltvalidatorclassgtedu.wustl.mir.ctt.util.SkipRequiredValidatorltvalidatorclassgt ltvalidatorgt codepre  pp  pThe custom validators arep  precodepublic class SkipRequiredValidator extends RequiredValidator       Override     public void validatefinal FacesContext context, final UIComponent component, final Object value          if ValidatorUtil.checkcontext              super.validatecontext, component, value                 public class SkipBeanValidator extends BeanValidator       Override     public void validatefinal FacesContext context, final UIComponent component, final Object value          if ValidatorUtil.checkcontext              super.validatecontext, component, value                codepre  pAnd the helper classp  precodepublic class ValidatorUtil       private static final String VALIDATE  VALIDATE      public static boolean check          return checkFacesContext.getCurrentInstance           public static boolean checkfinal FacesContext context          final ExternalContext externalContext  context.getExternalContext         final Object validate  externalContext.getRequestMap.getVALIDATE         if validate  null              return Boolean validate                  for final Map.EntryltString, String[]gt requestParameters  externalContext.getRequestParameterValuesMap             .entrySet              final String key  requestParameters.getKey             if key.containsdo                  externalContext.getRequestMap.putVALIDATE, Boolean.TRUE                 return true                               externalContext.getRequestMap.putVALIDATE, Boolean.FALSE         return false       codepre  pUsing tomcat7 and mojarra2.2, I can see that custom Required validator is indeed replaced and super.validate is NOT called as appropriate to the detected button id but the form is still validated for required fields.p  pCan anyone see what is wrong with what otherwise seems like an elegant solutionp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 7496 pNeed some help to generate appropriate Spunk query. I am searching for this but could not come up with a solution.p  pCurrently, I want to ignore all error alerts that are generated for logs with only ev31emerrorem term. If we use NOT ev31emerrorem in search query, it also removes results with valid error terms. So the current query will fail in case log contains both error and ev31emerrorem terms resulting in incorrect results. p  pCan anyone suggest a example query, where we can ignore ev31emerrorem term altogether but keep logs with error term.p

I manually call it over and over again for the same directory and sometimes it prints all the contents and the subdirectory contents as intended and sometimes it throws the exception. Sometimes the first call succeeds, sometimes the first call fails. I dont do anything with the directories at all, they just stay in the same place, untouched.p  pOther topics with a similar issue that Ive found involved not setting codeerrnocode to 0, but as the code above shows, Im doing that. Im even constructing the codeconst char code parameter before setting codeerrnocode to 0, just in case.p  pThe struct is constructed inside a function. If any exception throws, the destructor activates and closes the codeDIRcode handle. Debugging confirms this. The error messages in the destructor never happen. The only thing that could go wrong there is that codedirHandlecode is null, and the constructor fails in that scenario.p  pWhen I disable the recursion, it always works for the root dir, but it fails frequently for any of the root dirs subdirectories. The root directory is codehomemynameos3serverfilescode. My project is in a completely different directory so I always access it by absolute path.p  pEvery time this struct is accessed it is through the exact same function calls. There is no random factor in my program anywhere.p  pIm out of ideas for what could cause this. Im especially puzzled that the error is codeENOENTcode when the files clearly exist and it often finds them.p

Negative 7496 pMy problem is quite strange. Im developing CakePHP application. At the beginning I was doing all stuff on my local server with Windows... and works pretty good. But now I had to do upload to companys server. Now the app doesnt work due to CamelCase convention. My filenames looks like this codePostCategoriesControllercode. On local Windows server theres no problem. But after upload when I type web address in my browser I see codePostcategoriesController could not be foundcode. I know Windows and Linux are casesensitive in different ways. However in Cookbook we can read that developers should use CamelCase convention, so what Im doing wrongp

Negative 7496 pI made this c program to know all paths from 1n in a graph. This is a undirectional graph.

While i am on some path, and i visit some list through it, say list number x, i mark it 1, so that we dond keep visit it in this path again or keep walking circularly through it. and when i am done with it, i mark it 0 again, so that if any other path uses it as sub path it can again go through it.p  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt int mark[100001]0,n,m,sols,arr[100001],j0,k struct node      int data     struct node nextnode  struct list      struct node head  struct graph      int v     struct list arr  struct node createnewnodeint data     struct node newnodemallocsizeofstruct node     newnodegtdatadata     newnodegtnextnodeNULL     return newnode  struct graph createnewgraphint v      int i     struct graph newgraphmallocsizeofstruct graph     newgraphgtvv     newgraphgtarrmallocv1sizeofstruct list     fori0iltvi         newgraphgtarr[i].headNULL          return newgraph  void addedgestruct graph g,int a,int b      struct node newnodecreatenewnodeb     newnodegtnextnodeggtarr[a].head     ggtarr[a].headnewnode     newnodecreatenewnodea     newnodegtnextnodeggtarr[b].head     ggtarr[b].headnewnode  void dfsstruct graph g,int listnum     struct node al    alggtarr[listnum].head    mark[listnum]1    arr[j]listnum    whilealNULL         ifmark[algtdata]1             alalgtnextnode             continue                  ifalgtdatan             arr[j]n             fork0kltjk                  printfd ,arr[k]             printfn             sols                  else             dfsg,algtdata             mark[algtdata]0                  alalgtnextnode      int main      int a,b,i     scanfdd,ampn,ampm     i0     struct graph gcreatenewgraphn1     whileiltm         scanfdd,ampa,ampb         addedgeg,a,b         i          sols0     dfsg,1     printftotal number of paths is dn,sols     return 0  codepre  pfor input  7 7 1 2  3 2 3 4 7 4 6 2 5 6 7 5p  pactual paths are 1 2 6 5 7 and 1 2 3 4 7 p  pbut what i am able to print is p  p1 2 6 5 7 p  p1 2 6 5 7 3 4 7 p  pnotice, the 1 2 x x x 3 4 7 is the real path, but x x x, i.e. 2 6 5 of the previous path is still displayed.

So my question is, is there a better more efficient way architecture to store retrieve my data setp  pOne thing to note, I know Guids are inherently slow to index search but I am pretty much constrained to using them due to the way Dynamics CRM works.  I guess I could create a Dictionary to lookup Guids and convert them to integer values, or something along those lines, but I am not convinced that would help muchp  pemEditemp  pOkay, I tested the three solutions using my live data 371,901 Guids and these are the results as an average time per 1,000 Guids.  Note that this includes the processing INSERT to SQL Server so it isnt a proper benchmark.p  precodeMethod 0  List with Lambda    30.00s per 1,000 rows I never benchmarked this precisely Method 1  IntersectWith        40.24s per 1,000 rows cloning my Hashset spoilt this Method 2  BinarySearch          3.20s per 1,000 rows Method 3  Generic Dictionary    2.19s per 1,000 rows codepre  pOn the basis of this I am going to probably rewrite my code from scratch as I think the whole approach I was taking was incorrect.p  pHowever, this has been a very useful learning exercise and many thanks to everyone who contributed.  I am going to accept the BinarySearch as the correct answer as it does what I wanted and is much faster than my original code.p  pJust to be clear here, the IntersectWith is indeed smoking fast, but it doesnt work for my particular problem as I need to constantly go back to my original hashset.p

Negative 7496 pI have a scenario where I want to use rules purely as a scheduled job for invoking other services.

So I have rule 1 which looks likep  precoderule ServiceCheck  timer  int 3m 5m   noloop true when then     boolean isServiceEnabled  DummyServices.getServiceEnabledProperty     ifisServiceEnabled         ServicesCheck servicesCheck  new ServicesCheck               servicesCheck.setServiceEnabledtrue         insertservicesCheck      end codepre  pThis inserts a servicesCheck object every 5 minutes if services are enabled. Once this object is inserted my other rules fire and retract the servicesCheck fact from there.p  pThe problem I am facing is when I switch off the app and start it next day. At that time, the ServiceCheck rule gets fired a load of times before coming to a stop. My assumption is that the last fired time is saved in the session and when I restart, it finds a difference between current time and saved time and fires the rules for number of times till the 2 times match in the session. So effectively, to catch up for 1 hr gap from shutdown to restart, it will fire the rule 12 times in this case as the interval set is 5 mins. Is there a way using which I can update the last fired time on the rules session so that it starts working like a fresh new start without catching up for lost time.p

Negative 7496 pI am trying to benchmark my Hard drive, this is to say calculate its latency ms and throughput MBs. To do that, I want to measure the execution time of the function f.write of Python.

Negative 7496 pI feel like i want to practicing Java in a more ObjectOriented way, that it is supposed.p  pI am doing a small hobby project that i got inspiration from a android app called HexaTime.p  pThe idea or the end result Im aiming for is the follow scenariop  pOpens the application,  A digital clock is showing with a hexalike format 093343 instead of the usual 093344 hhmmss.p  pThe background color of the window itself is to be changed with the exact current time and countingconverting the hour, minute and seconds in to real hexadecimals. Then a color function will change the color of the background taking the hexadecimals and converting it to R,G,B format  or if its possible to put the pure hexadecimals into a Paint.valueOf  p  pAt the beginning i thought i could be simple, but now that i have tried a bit i realize its possible, but take a bit more time and a bit more complex than i thought.p  pWould really appreciate some help, for example displaying the clock on the window.  Here is as far as i have got, i have tried some different approaches with Timer.scheduleFixRate or what it was called but could go forward with it due to lack of further knowledge of how to proceed.p  pClockViewp  precodepackage hexatime  import javafx.application.Application import javafx.scene.Scene import javafx.stage.Stage  public class ClockView extends Application       public static void main String[] args  throws InterruptedException         launchargs           public void startStage primaryStage throws Exception          primaryStage.setTitleHexaClock         primaryStage.setScenenew Scenenew ClockController, 450,300         primaryStage.show       codepre  pClockControllerp  precodepackage hexatime  import java.util.Calendar import javafx.animation. import javafx.event. import javafx.scene.control.Label import javafx.util.Duration   public class ClockController extends Label      public ClockModel clock      public ClockController         updateTime           private void updateTime         Timeline timeline  new Timeline         new KeyFrameDuration.seconds0,             new EventHandlerltActionEventgt                  Override public void handleActionEvent event                      Calendar time  Calendar.getInstance                     SimpleDateFormat sdf  SimpleDateFormatHHmmss                     setTextsdf.formattime.getTime                                       ,         new KeyFrameDuration.seconds1                  timeline.setCycleCountAnimation.INDEFINITE         timeline.play               public static int[] hexToNumString hex         if hex.charAt0               hex  hex.split             hex  hex.toUpperCase             String hexalphabets  0123456789ABCDEF             int[] value  new int[3]             int k  0             int int1, int2             for int i  0 i lt 6 i2                 int1  hexalphabets.indexOfhex.charAti                 int2  hexalphabets.indexOfhex.charAti1                 value[k]  int1  16  int2                 k                          return value           codepre  pClockModelp  precodepackage hexatime  import java.util.Date  public class ClockModel implements ClockInterface       public int hour     public int minute     public int seconds     public String hexHour     public String hexMinute     public String hexSecond       SuppressWarningsdeprecation     public ClockModelDate time         hour  time.getHours         minute  time.getMinutes         seconds time.getSeconds           public int getHour         return hour           public int getMinutes         return minute           public int getSeconds         return seconds      codepre  pp

Negative 7496 pSo I have a task to write some pseudo code to program a frequency synthesizer. There are three main ports to this that I will utilize, Enable, Data, and Clock.p  pThe device is initially off, and when enable active low is triggered, the clock will cycle after some minimum setup time. Aside from the delays, I will have a function SendCommanduint32t addr, uint16t data.p  pThe issue that I am having, is that in the specifications given to me, the data is READ on a falling clock edge. This means that the data is read into the register at the address defined in the parameter, one bit at a time, and is kept on reading until the entire 16bit word has been written to the register. The clock cycles at about 10MHz. My questions arep  pstrongHow can I simulate the clock to cycle at 10MHz 100 nscyclestrongp  pstrongHow can I perform the data reading on the falling edge of said clock.strongp  pFor now ignore the writing aspect of the program, it is still just pseudocode.p

As an example the repeating views that are required are like this. from the edittext with id etsaleproductname up to the linearlayout with id lay1 inclusive is the part that once the button to proceed is clicked should reappear below the current one filled with data.

Negative 7496 pWe have a problem with our BizTalk applications with receive locations and send ports connecting to an oracle database. We run out of connections.p  pI dont know why, but original developers used both WCFCustom and WCFOracleDB, but I think both use ODP.NET as the ADO.NET provider.p  pSince, in ADO.NET and certainly in ODP.NET, connection pools are keyed on the connection string exact string match, I think, a connection pool could logically be shared among send ports and receive locations.

Negative 7496 pI am developing a browser extension which aims to help a user eliminate the hidden information embedded in the image heshe is uploading to the current web page.

In the above code, I add the change event listener on all codeltinput typefilegtcode elements to detect if the user is uploading a file. p  pHowever, many websites use an indirect way for users to upload files. Specifically, they dont use codeltinput typefilegtcode element for users to select files for upload, but provide a small iconimage. And when clicked, the iconimage will trigger a popup window where the user can select a local file for upload. In this case, the above code does not work because the source code of the web page doesnt contain codeltinput typefilegtcode elements but the user does upload a file in the indirect way. p  pTake the current webpage for example. When you scroll down this page to Your Answer section, clicking on the small image icon next to strong strong will allow you to select an image from computer for upload. However, the codeltinput typefilegtcode element in the popup window cannot be detected because a browser extension basically executes on every page tab load i.e DOM ready and when the page loads, the popup window even doesnt exist. p  pForgive my wordiness.

Negative 7496 pIm calculating a CCITT CRC16 bit by bit. I do this that way because its a prototype that later should be ported to VHDL and end up in hardware to check a serial bitstream.p  pOn the net I found a single bit CRC16 update step code. Wrote a testprogram and it works. Except for one strange thing I have to feed the bits of a byte from lowest to highest bit. If I do it this way, I get correct results.p  pIn the CCITT definition of CRC16 the bits should be feed highest bit to lowest bit though. The datastream that I want to calculate the CRC from comes in this format as well, so my current code is kind of useless for me.p  pIm confused. I would have not expected that feeding the bits the wrong way around could work at all.p  pstrongQuestion Why is it possible that a CRC can be written to take the data in two different bitorders, and how do I transform my single bit update code that it accepts the data MSB firststrongp  pFor reference, here is the relevant code.

Negative 7496 pIve been musing on this for a week and Im not quite sure of a way to do this.

But I want the V to be an ImmutableList, and Id like the incoming stream to map multiple values with the same key paired to said key with an ImmutableList value. Every implementation Ive tried has been suboptimal and not streamlike, as I kept falling back on using a plain HashMap holding ImmutableList.Builder values, and when Im done populating I would loop through it and convert it into ImmutableList values by calling build and putting it in a new map.

Negative 7496 pI have a REST API with strongRestlet 2.3strong and need to implement a fileuploading functionality to it. The problem is that, when someone uploads a file using a POST with a multipartformdata ContentType, the file reaches the server with another encoding. To test this, I printed the contents of the original file in a Unix Terminal and then printed it again before parsing the requet with strongApache Commons FileUploadstrong with almost the same code of this example a hrefhttprestlet.comtechnicalresourcesrestletframeworkguide2.2extensionsfileupload relnofollowhttprestlet.comtechnicalresourcesrestletframeworkguide2.2extensionsfileuploada. Both printed contents are very similar, but the original file has less characters, so i assume that my Java server is using the wrong encoding to interpret the file.p  pThe file I sent is a PNG image. With text files the server works perfectly, but when I send photos or any binary file, the problem appears.p

Negative 7496 pI have a list of 10 to max 300 string codes 40 word characters capitalized that need to be stored inside an oauth2 codeAccess Tokencode Claims based authorization  I have to keep the token small as much as I can header size problem so Im searching a way to create a small unique identifier representing the original string inside the token.p  pI would then create a lookup table where I will put the uid and the original string.br When the Token will be sent by the client, through the uid and the lookup table I will get the original string back.p  pIve read that it is possible to truncate the first bytes of a hash MD5, SHA1 and I would like to know if I can follow this path safely.p  pIs it possible to safely collision wise create a list of hashes unique of these strings where each hash would be 45 bytes maxp  pstrongEditstrongbr I cant pregenerate a random string as a index or just a list index for example because this list could change and increase in size when the server application is deployed for example and new codes are added to this list so I have to be sure that when I get the token back from the client, the uid will be bound to the correct code.p

Negative 7496 pI have an XCode project that used to be ObjectiveC but now includes some Swift classes mixed in.  Everything is set up right for building, with my bridging header and MyProjectSwift.h file.  So thats fine.p  pMy problem is that if Im looking at ObjectiveC source and I command click a class or method name, instead of opening my Swift file it opens up the MyProjectSwift.h file.

Negative 7496 pI am using below code to process the big CSV file, it will split the CSV for every 2000 records and schedules a thread to process the 2000 records, at the end, after all threads finishes it execution, the future is taken.p  pI am facing the following problem, When i have CSV of 2000 records 1 thread takes 32 sec oly but CSV 0f 8000 records 4 thread takes around 1.3 mins. Here i can see all the threads started at same time and finishes execution at same time.p  pWhat is the problem here as far as i can understand when we process with threads, time taken by each thread should be same when we increase number of threads.

Negative 7496 pLet me share some background of my bottleneckp  pI have set up an inhouse load testing infrastructure using python functional tests ,pytest, boto library, selenium Grid and many AWS EC2 instances.p  pI initiate, almost concurrently, around 200 pytest instances 200 functional tests starting at the same time on a emm3.mediumem EC2 instance which is also the Hub of selenium grid, and it then sends them to 40 EC2 instances selenium grid nodes running browsers that hit my web app.p  pMy bottleneck is that the Hubm3.medium instance is overwhelmed by the concurrent amount of pytest calls and the CPU maxes out to 100 eventually making it unresponsive to any request.p  pMy questions arep  ol lipDo I use py.test in too much of an unorthodox waypli lipIs there a number of concurrent pytest instances or the limit is essentially enforced by the hardware resources I now upgraded to an m3.large to see how it will go.. pli liWill the py.test plugin xdist make any differenceli liI even considered the alternative of setting up a couple or quad of instances that will only send the tests to the hub. Their only job would be basically to divide the pytest load. Does it make any sense Is there a simpler way that I didnt think ofli ol  pEDIT Just the following question then. Is there a number of concurrent pytest instances or the limit is essentially enforced by the hardware resources I now upgraded to an m3.large to see how it will go.. p

Negative 7496 pI am currently starting work on an iOS App which will display new content weekly. The app will need to display videos and text as well as a few images. p  pThe problem is that I need to be able to update the content the app shows without releasing a new update every time. Therefore I am at a loss as to how to display all of these different elements remotely.p  pFor the videos I was thinking that I may be able to simply host the weeks video on a web server and then create a link to that to display it in the app with the iOS media player. Either way I think that text could be a problem. Please could you suggest on some relatively simple ways to go about doing something like thisp  pAny help would be hugely appreciated.p  pThanks, Dylanp  pPS Would it be worth doing something like this native as opposed to packaging an HTML5 document as an app with Cocoon JS as all the content would be pulled in from the web anywayp

Negative 7496 pI have a Runnable thread which loops through an infinite loop. Per iteration it sleeps upto next task time and then does some task. This task is very critical hence makes the thread running it also very critical. I am not really a java thread expert so I was wondering what can be the various scenarios or possibilities where the JVM may decide to stop  terminate this thread. At the application level there is no restriction for number of running threads or so. I am concerned about how JVM would behave for a longrun.p  pFor now everything works fine in my local test system but I could hardly test this for some hours. This is an web application running under Apache Tomcat.p  pThe thread creation and running is simple as shown below  p  precodeThread taskThread  new Threadnew TaskRunnabletaskObject taskThread.start codepre  pLoop  p  precodepublic void run    for         long sleepTime  this.taskObject.getNextTaskTime  System.currentTimeMillis      if sleepTime gt 0L        try                Thread.sleepsleepTime              catch InterruptedException localInterruptedException                localInterruptedException.printStackTrace                 this.taskObject.performTask  also computes next task time     codepre  pOr this will work fine for a longrun as long as there are no exceptions in the running thread itself..p

The database contains the following columns p  ul lisession contains the sessionIDli lidata contains the data of the session li liupdatedTime contains the last activity of the session li lilocked Default is false. However if codevariablecode lt codeaccesscode this is set to trueli ul  pSo, currently I have the below p  precodepublic function readid                timeout  time  30          thisgtdatabasegtquerySELECT updatedTime, data FROM sessions WHERE session  id         thisgtdatabasegtbindid, id           ifthisgtdatabasegtexecute                      ifthisgtdatabasegtrowCount gt 0                              row  thisgtdatabasegtsingleResult                  ifrow[updatedTime] lt timeout                                      sessionunset                     sessiondestroy                      return                                    return row[data]                                 return        public function destroyid               locked  true           thisgtdatabasegtqueryUPDATE sessions SET locked  locked WHERE session  id         thisgtdatabasegtbindlocked, locked          thisgtdatabasegtbindid, id           ifthisgtdatabasegtexecute                      return true                     return false      codepre  pWhen the condition is true  coderow[updatedTime] lt timeoutcode  it runs codesessiondestroycode however because it relies on a database object passed to the class this is destroyed when codesessiondestroycode is ran meaning there is no active db connection. Well, this is as far as I understand what is happening. I might of understood this completely wrong. p  pThe 30 second timeout is for testing purposes only. Okay, so what Im after is when the last activity of the session exceeds the current set timeout it needs to destroy the session and set the codelockedcode column to codetruecode. p  pThanksp

Could some one tell me where is the postgres database file located in ubuntu or how to remove from commandline Thanks in advance.p
Negative 7496 pIve made a friend request system that basically, when strongUser1strong sends strongUser2strong a friend request, in strongUser1strongs row, strongUser1strong is stored in the column From and strongUser2strong is stored in the column To. There is also another column called Status which is automatically set to Pending, until its accepted or declined.p  pNow for strongUser2strong, I have a PFQuery that finds all friend requests rows where the current user is saved in To anywhere in the database. When strongUser2strong accepts the request, my Javascript PFCloud Code basically creates a relation for strongUser1strong with strongUser2strong in a column called Friends My ObjectiveC code creates the relation for strongUser2strong with strongUser1strong. Now this all works fine, except now, instead of the From, To and Status columns being in the same database, I have moved them to a different database called FriendRequests.p  pThe only problem I am having is changing my Javascript code. At the moment it can query the FriendRequest database and gather the To users, From users and Status strongBUTstrong I cant get it to create the relation between strongUser1strong and strongUser2strong as they are in the User database.p  pThis is the cloud code p  precodeParse.Cloud.defineaddFriendToFriendsRelation, functionrequest, response   Parse.Cloud.useMasterKey  var friendRequestId  request.params.friendRequest var query  new Parse.QueryFriendRequests query.getfriendRequestId,       success functionfriendRequest           var fromUser  friendRequest.getfrom          var toUser  friendRequest.getto          var relation  fromUser.relationfriends          relation.addtoUser           fromUser.savenull,               success function                   friendRequest.setstatus, accepted                 friendRequest.savenull,                       success function                           response.successsaved relation and updated friendRequest                     ,                       error functionerror                           response.errorError 1                                                     ,              error functionerror                response.errorError 2                              ,      error functionerror           response.errorError 3           codepre  pI am trying to set the codevar relation  fromUser.relationfriendscode and coderelation.addtocode to the codeUsercode database.p

Im trying to establish a WCF connection.  I have already successfully done this with some hardcoded values, but Im trying to make it dynamic via the codedoSomeStuffcode method.  I believe a race condition is occurring which the MessageBox is fixing somehow. Application A is starting Application B the source code I have shown here then sending a command line argument with some parameters into Application B.  Without the MessageBox, Application A throws a TCP 10061 error.p  pAnother point of interest, is there any easy way to debug WCF connections  I have access to the source of both applications, but Im not sure if it is possible to have Application A launch Application B with the debugger instead of just the executable. This would help immensely.p  pEDIT  Was playing around a bit more... found that if I use an codeApplication.DoEventscode instead of a messageBox, its the same result.p

Negative 7496 pIm developing a nested navigation menu in html5 using ul ul ul li, but I want the width of the 3rd tier element to be different according to which top level menu element is selected.  So if I start with menu item 1, I want the bottom level element to be 100px wide, but if I start with menu item 2, I want the bottom level to be 200px wide.p  pI thought I should be able to use an inline style definition to redefine the style for ul ul ul li in between the html code for the top level items in the list, but I cant find the right syntax.  Firstly, am I going about this the right way If so, what is the syntaxp  precodeul ul ul li  width100px  codepre  pdoesnt seem to work. Any suggestionsp

Negative 7496 pIm making an app to store records of several users, and I want to be able to access the records once in a while as in pull the .sql file. Im currently using an SQLite database but the default location is in the data folder which can be accessed for the emulator but not for a physical device, unless it is rooted. I cannot root the physical device so is there any way to change where the database is stored in the device so that I can easily access it laterp
