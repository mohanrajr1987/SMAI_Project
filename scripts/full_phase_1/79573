Positive 79573 pAt our company we have a Google Spreadsheets which is shared by a link with different employees. This spreadsheet is saved on a Google Drive to which only I have access. The link is configured as such that anyone with the link can edit the spreadsheet since all employees need to be able to make changes to the file.p  pAlthough this is very useful, it also presents a risk in the form of data loss. If a user were to accidentally delete or alter the wrong data and saves the file, this data is permanently lost.p  pTo prevent this I was wondering if it is possible to automatically have a backup created, say every day. Ideally, this backup is saved in the same Google Drive. I know I could install the desktop client and have the file backed up by our daily company backup, but it seems a bit ridiculous to install it for just one file. Im sure there has to be another solution to this, ie with scripts.p

Positive 79573 pI have an app setup with the WebClient structure, using it as a kind of server manager for many users. They cant access the account but only some folders, as I do all the authorization steps by code.

But now there are some files that can be uploaded through the Web drive.google.com domain, and I need to own this files that the emails from my same domain have uploaded. So I was thinking if it was possible to have a service account to change permissions only, and do all the file uploads though the WebClient Account within the same project and email Thanks.p

Negative 79573 pI just created a simple .NET Windows service. My users are supposed to download it from my site and install it on their computers. So, from various forum posts including this site I know that in order to do this I need an installer. Or I can just give them service files and instruct how to install it. I begun with creating a setup project and was able to compile my own .msi installer. But one user complained that he cannot uninstall it now. I researched it and found that .msi format has some issues, mostly related to the way it counts references in GAC. It was very easy to help him to fix his computer, though. From my conversations with users I know that it would be close to impossible to train them to use sc.exe or installutil.exe. I also found a service at a hrefhttpinstaller.codeeffects.com relnofollowhttpinstaller.codeeffects.coma that can build an installer for my service without any code but Im not sure if my installer should be msi or exe.

Negative 79573 pIve read here on StackOveflow and other sources that the behavior of the remove function is simply reordering the original container so that the elements that are TO BE REMOVED are moved to the end of the container and ARE NOT deleted.

Negative 79573 pWe host our images on Amazon S3, and serve them through Amazon Cloudfront.  Wed like to reduce our bandwidth expenses.  We believe that we have quite a bit of bandwidth theft, and want to start using signed URLs to prevent this.  However, we have to balance this against the fact that each time we send out a new signed url, it invalidates the browser caches for the image.p  pOur current plan is to generate a signed url that is valid for two months, then cache it locally and serve it for a month, before generating a new signed URL.  This will allow the browser to cache the images for longer. However, this also means that anyone can then leech bandwidth for an image for up to two months.p  pIs there any way to have the link expire sooner, but have the browser continue to cache that image  I know that the etag and IfModifiedSince for the image do not change when the url is resigned for a new timestamp, but the the browser no longer knows to send those values in the header, because as far as it is concerned, this is a new URL.  Is there any way around this problemp

Negative 79573 pI have just been issued with a Windows 7 64 bit machine at my code shop.  We run Visual Studio 2005.  I filled out the ToolsOptionsDebuggingSymbols panel, pointing to the Microsoft Symbol Server and caching to Cwindowssymbols, and started a new instance of our app.  There was a pause as the MS symbol server was contacted, then the EULA turned up and I accepted, but then no symbols loaded.  This is a pretty big problem as much of whats going wrong in my department is down to memory management which requires the OS symbols.p  pAll the local symbols for the app loaded fine, as well as apparently MFC80U.i386.pdb.

Negative 79573 pQuestion I have a mailserver written in C and want to add a webinterface.p  pNow the way I see it, there are two possibilitiesbr 1 Somebody wants to integrate the mailserver on his own webpagewebapp  needs WebService interfacebr 2 Somebody wants to access the mailserver via a webinterface, e.g. on localhost for configuration, but maybe also for writing and reading email. brbr Whats the best way to unify these 2 demands I mean with 2, the mailserver basically needs his own webserver, listening on port 80 or n, where it displays a page that e.g. ideally uses the WebService  to integrate the webserver funcionality into the integrated webserverwebpage. But said integrated webserver should not interfere with an ordinary webserver, if running on that machine.p  pAlso there is the problem of ports and firewalls on the client side and in corporate networks.p  pIs that feasiblea good idea, or are there better waysp

Negative 79573 pThe algorithm Im talking about using would allow you to present it with x number of items with each having a range of a to b with the result being y. I would like to have an algorithm which would, when presented with the values as described would output the possibility of it happening.p  pFor example, for two die. Since I already know themdue to the possible results being so low. Itd be able to tell you each of the possibilities.p  pThe setup would be something like. x2 a1 b6. If you wanted to know the chance of having it result in a 2. Then itd simply spit out 136or its float value. If you put in 7 as the total sum, itd tell you 6.p  pSo my question is, is there a simple way to implement such a thing via an algorithm that is already written. Or does one have to go through every single iteration of each and every item to get the total number of combinations for each value.p  pThe exact formula would also, give you the combinations to make each of the values from 112.p  pSo itd give you a distribution array with each ones combinations at each of the indexes. If it does 012. Then 0 would have 0, 1 would have 0, and 2 would have 1.p  pI feel like this is the type of problem that someone else has had and wanted to work with and has the algorithm already done. If anyone has an easy way to do this beyond simply just looping through every possible value would be awesome.p  pI have no idea why I want to have this problem solved, but for some reason today I just had this feeling of wanting to solve it. And since Ive been googling, and using wolfram alpha, along with trying it myself. I think its time to concede defeat and ask the community.p  pId like the algorithm to be in c, or maybe PHPeven though Id rather it not be since its a lot slower. The reason for c is simply because I want raw speed, and I dont want to have to deal with classes or objects.p  pPseudo code, or C is the best ways show your algorithm.p  pEditp  pAlso, if I offended the person with a b in his name due to the thing about mathematics Im sorry. Since I didnt mean to offend, but I wanted to just state that strongIstrong didnt understand it. But the answer couldve stayed on there since Im sure there are people who might come to this question and understand the mathematics behind it.p  pAlso I cannot decide which way that I want to code this up. I think Ill try using both and then decide which one I like more to seeuse inside of my little library.p  pThe final thing that I forgot to say is that, calculus is about four going on five years ago. My understanding of probability, statistics, and randomness come from my own learning via looking at codereading wikipediareading books. p  pIf anyone is curious what sparked this question. I had a book that I was putting off reading called emThe Drunkards Walkem and then once I say XKCD 904, I decided it was time to finally get around to reading it. Then two nights ago, whilst I was going to sleep... I had pondered how to solve this question via a simple algorithm and was able to think of one. p  pMy coding understanding of code comes from tinkering with other programs, seeing what happened when I broke something, and then trying my own things whilst looking over the documentation for the build in functions. I do understand big O notation from reading over wikipediaas much as one can from that, and pseudo code was because its so similar to python. I myself, cannot write pseudo codeor says the teachers in college. I kept getting notes like make it less like real code make it more like pseudo code. That thing hasnt changed.p  pEdit 2 Incase anyone searching for this question just quickly wanted the code. Ive included it below. It is licensed under the LGPLv3 since Im sure that there exists closedsource equivalents of this code.p  pIt should be fairly portable since it is written entirely in c. If one was wanting to make it into an extension in any of the various languages that are written in c, it should take very little effort to do so. I chose to mark the first one that linked to Ask Dr. Math as the answer since it was the implementation that I have used for this question.p  pThe first files name is sumprobability.cp  precodeinclude ltmath.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt include ltstdio.hgt include ltlimits.hgt       filename sumprobability.c          Set of functions to calculate the probabilty of n number of items adding up to s     with sides x.

Negative 79573 pSince I am new to iOS development I have a few Questions. Firstly I did read some of the other related questions I just want to clarify a few things.p  pAs I understand itp  ol lipI can make an app for a client and then the client can purchase the app for me and register a Enterprise account and then be able to distribute the app in house. But they need to have 500 employees to be able to subscribe for Enterprise.pli lipI can make an app and distribute it to end users in the normal manner. Nothing funky about this.pli ol  pNow my questions are, what way should one go about when you want to create an in house app for a client with less than 500 employees, which means they cant register for a enterprise account And is it posible to list an app for free on app store but you can only use it if you have a license code that you need to enter to unlock the app, so basically when Jon Doe downloads the app he cant use it, but if the client downloads the app they enter the code and the app then gets unlockedp  pEdit Not Applicable Anymore, See Edit 2 Ok did some more research, another problem I        will be facing in the new future is that South African companies cant get a DUNS number which is required for the enterprise license, so basically that route is blocked for me, because of that problem. So what other way is there to go about thisp  pEdit 2 After some further research I found that the DUNS number can be obtained outside the US and that South Africa is listed as a country in which a DUNS number can be obtained. Can anyone out side the US and mostly outside Europe confirm that DUNS numbers are available in their countries, and actually know of companies in there country that has one. And I know I am going of topic but how can I check if a company has a DUNS number.p  pThanksp

From a config file, you can configure the name of the table that will be inserted into.p  pI am parameterizing the insert statement, but the configurable table name will be used in an insert statement, and its a potential vector for attack.

Negative 79573 pI have built a custom view component that displays a timeline of events. The component is built from several custom subclasses of NSView, each implementing specific visual aspects of the events in the timeline. Most classes display themselves by a combination of existing Cocoa components added via the initWithFrame method and some custom drawing via the drawRect method.p  pThe timeline is  due to its size  wrapped in an NSScrollView that allows the user to horizontally scroll through the timeline. The timeline maps the coordinate system of its frame to the events that are displayed, so events that run for a long time take up more pixel real estate.p  pThis all works nice. However, I would now like to add a feature that displays a view which is scaled down version of the real timeline  comparable to the effect of scaling down an image where you lose detail when scaling down.p  pIs it somehow possible to echo the drawing done in one view to another view, which is a scaled down version copy of the original viewp

Therefore, to prevent something like that from happening we had to code in our own exception classes i.e. strongIf the plane is ordered to load cargo while in flight, throw InvalidActionExceptionstrongp  pMy question is how can I strongcontinuestrong to readin commands from the text file after exceptions have been thrown seeing as how once they are thrown, the program cannot progress furtherp  pHeres an outline of what I want to dop  precode    Scanner input  new Scannernew FileInputStreamstuff1.txt      whileinput.hasNextLine              try                        execute commands by reading them using input.nextLine                  catch                      catch any exceptions and ignore them... continue to read            the file for more commands               codepre  pI would appreciate any help.

Negative 79573 pIve been trying to have my Silverlight application work with a WCF net.tcp binding the whole day and couldnt make it, even though it seems to me Ive done everything right, including after some googling...p  pI had a WCF service with a basicHttpBinding endpoint which worked perfectly, and as my WCF service and my Silverlight application are on the same network, told myself why not trying something else than HTTP p  hr  pSo I began googling to see what had to be done, and heres the list of what I did p  h2Serverh2  ul liChecked that Net.Tcp Listener Adapter service was runningli ul  h2IISh2  ul liEnabled net.tcp binding on my website, with binding information set to 4502li liAdded net.tcp protocol to the Application that hosts my WCF serviceli liAdded a policy in the clientaccesspolicy.xml file to allow socket connection on ports 45024536li ul  h2WCF Serviceh2  ul liAdded a net.tcp binding with Security set to Noneli liAdded an endpoint with this binding for my service, keeping the regular HTTP oneli ul  hr  pAfter doing all this, I can use my WCF service with WcfTestClient, it sees the two endpoints HTPP and net.tcp, and both of them work like a charm.p  pIn my Silverlight application, I can update my service reference which I added with the HTTP address of my service, not the TCP one, and it also sees the two endpoints because it added the TCP endpoint in the ServiceReferences.ClientConfig. As I saw when googling, netTcpBinding is not supported in Silverlight, thus it describes the binding as a custom binding with a  and a  element.p  pI saw on the different tutorials I followed that, as for the HTTP binding, Silverlight asks for a socket policy file to check if the client has access to the WCF service. In SL4 Beta, this file was requested by TCP on port 943. As of SL4 RC and RTM, its requested by HTTP on port 80, as it is for the HTTP bindings.p  pThe thing is, when I launch my application with the proxy set to use the net.tcp binding, I checked with Fiddler, the clientaccesspolicy.xml is strongNOTstrong requested at any time, and I get the emclassicem error when the socket policy file is not present   TCP error code 10013 An attempt was made to access a socket in a way forbidden by its access permissions.p  pAfter googling, I found out that SL looks for this file with the IP address of the server, not its name, but trying a hrefhttpIPOFMYSERVERclientaccesspolicy.xmlhttpIPOFMYSERVERclientaccesspolicy.xmla in a browser on my client machine serves the file as expected...p  pSo Im a bit lost here, I would really like to have it working to see something else than HTTP with WCF...p  pSomeone has any bit of a clue to guess what happens  As the service works as expected with WcfTestCLient with the net.tcp binding, Im guessing this has something to do specifically with SL...p  pThanks for reading p

Negative 79573 pIs there a way in silverlight to detect when a lost focus event is triggered if this  happens because the tab key is pressed or the user presses a mouse button on another control.p  pThis is what i want to achievep  pI have a RadGridView with 1 row. In the last column i have a numeric input, when an user tabs out of this control, a new row should be added to the sourcecollection in the viewmodel, this automaticly adds a new row to the grid, then the first column on this row should have focus and the dropdownlist in the celledittemplate should be opened.p  pWhen i use the lost focus event adding the new row works fine, though this also works when i dont use tab to unfocus the control. Also, the first column on the new row is not selected, it somehow gives focus to row 0 column 0.p

Negative 79573 pIve got a problem where our application hangs on our customers machines that Ive been on for days now without solving. The problem arises quite randomly from what weve seen, even though that may not be the true case. The customer also reports that the CPU is peaking when the application hangs.p  pThe problem is that Ive no idea where the application is failing hanging. We have a couple of plugins written in C as plugins for the main COM application as well.p  pIve managed to get the customer to take a MiniDump with ProcExp on a machine where the problem occurred. However, Im not very familiar with WinDBG or MiniDumps either for that matter. Ive run codeanalyze vcode and codeanalyze v hangcode, which produces some output, including the stack below. For what Im able to tell, it seems the application is transitioning into one of our C plugins CLR and then back again to COM, which ought to be an interface back to the main application that is available to the plugins.

Negative 79573 pI need to get some sensitive data from an Oracle server to a SQL Server for use in my ASP.NET website. Lets say its passwords. Our security guys say that these passwords need to be secured every step of the way. My website needs to be able to compare user input to these passwords. These passwords must be transferred from the Oracle server to SQL Server at night and can only be used on SQL Server during the day.p  pThe best solution I can come up with is that we need to hash the passwords on Oracle and pass the hashes to SQL Server lets assume the connection between the two is secure, because thats not my job P . Then my ASP.NET web application needs to be able to implement the exact same hashing on user input so we can compare the input hash to the database hash.p  pSo my question is how can I hash something using the same algorithmkeysalt on Oracle and .NET  I know how to use the .NET hashing functions, but Im not sure what I can use in Oracle that would be comparable...  I could potentially pass them in plain text from ASP.NET to SQL Server and hash them there if thats easier, but lets call that Plan B.p

Negative 79573 pI have a C application that sometimes needs to export information to a spreadsheet. It is designed to do so using COM and ActiveX integration with Microsoft Excel and OpenOffice Calc.p  pI noticed with one of the newer versions of OpenOffice that my program would timeout and fail any time I tried doing the export.p  pI did quite a bit of research before figuring out that the failure required the following two eventsp  p1. Creation of a simple UI window with a custom procedure even if that procedure did not do anything more than pass everything on to the default procedurep  p2. Creation of a separate thread in which the code to launch OpenOffice via COM and ActiveX is executedp  pI should note that any given time, there is only ONE thread doing OpenOffice integration. It just happens to be a different thread from the one handling the UI.p  pI also noticed some other oddities.p  pIf the window class does NOT involve a custom procedure, no error occurs. However, if ANY custom procedure is involved it does occur. Even if the custom window procedure does absolutely nothing but pass all messages to the default window procedure, the error occurs.p  pIf no UI window is made, the code in the separate thread executes flawlessly.p  pIf the integration code is launched from the same thread as the UI, no error occurs. If the integration is first carried out within the same thread as the UI, subsequent creation and execution of a separate thread runs without error.p  pAnd this is the weirdest observation Im using Visual Studio 2005 for debugging. If I set a breakpoint just prior to the invocation of loadComponentFromURL, the hang will NOT occur. However, if I do NOT set a break point, when the hang occurs I can break execution and Ill find that the call stack indicates that it is stuck somewhere within the process of RPC invocation awaiting a return from WaitForMultipleObjectsEx....p  pBelow is a complete code example. If you compile and run this on a machine with the newest version of OpenOffice, it will hang. Within the WinMain... function, there is a call to TestOOCalc that is commented out. If you uncomment it, youll find the program now launches OpenOffice Calc perfectly.p  pGiven that there are NOT multiple threads attempting to access OpenOffice at the same time, this doesnt seem like it should be a threading issue at all.p  pI cant find anything anywhere about this phenomenon or what the root cause is. I really dont want to resort to putting all of the work in the same thread as the UI as this would make the UI unresponsive during lengthy operations.p  pThoughts Ideasp  precodeinclude ltwindows.hgt include ltatlbase.hgt include ltprocess.hgt  LRESULT CALLBACK WndProcHWND hwnd, UINT message, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam      return DefWindowProchwnd, message, wParam, lParam   BOOL MakeUIWindowHINSTANCE hInstance       Class definition for Main Window     WNDCLASS wndclass     ZeroMemoryampwndclass, sizeofwndclass      wndclass.style             CSHREDRAW  CSVREDRAW     wndclass.lpfnWndProc       WndProc     wndclass.hInstance         hInstance     wndclass.lpszClassName     TEXTProblem Window Class       Register the Main Window class     if RegisterClassampwndclass         return FALSE      HWND hwnd  CreateWindowEx0, TEXTProblem Window Class,                                          TEXTProblem, WSOVERLAPPEDWINDOW,                                        10, 10, 500, 500,                                          NULL, NULL, hInstance, NULL      ShowWindowhwnd, SWNORMAL      return TRUE   BOOL ActiveXMethodCallCComPtrltIDispatchgt amprcpPropInterface, const WCHAR wszMethod, const UINT uiArgs, VARIANTARG pArgs, CComPtrltIDispatchgt amprcpResult      DISPID dispid     HRESULT hr  rcpPropInterface.GetIDOfNamewszMethod, ampdispid     if FAILEDhr         return FALSE      DISPPARAMS dp     EXCEPINFO ei     VARIANT varReturn     ZeroMemoryampvarReturn, sizeofvarReturn     ZeroMemoryampdp, sizeofdp     ZeroMemoryampei, sizeofei      varReturn.vt  VTEMPTY      dp.cArgs  uiArgs     dp.rgvarg  pArgs      hr  rcpPropInterfacegtInvokedispid, IIDNULL, NULL, DISPATCHMETHOD, ampdp, ampvarReturn, NULL, NULL      if FAILEDhr         return FALSE      rcpResult.AttachvarReturn.pdispVal     return TRUE    Performs an initialization of OpenOffice BOOL TestOOCalc      if FAILEDCoInitializeNULL         return FALSE       Get class IDs for the ActiveX object specified     CLSID clsid     if FAILEDCLSIDFromProgIDLcom.sun.star.ServiceManager, ampclsid         return FALSE      CComPtrltIDispatchgt cpSvcMgr     if FAILEDcpSvcMgr.CoCreateInstanceclsid, NULL, CLSCTXLOCALSERVER         return FALSE      CComPtrltIDispatchgt cpDesktop       context change for local variants         VARIANTARG varArg         ZeroMemoryampvarArg, sizeofvarArg          varArg.scode  DISPEPARAMNOTFOUND         varArg.vt  VTBSTR         varArg.bstrVal  SysAllocStringLcom.sun.star.frame.Desktop          if ActiveXMethodCallcpSvcMgr, LcreateInstance, 1, ampvarArg, cpDesktop                      VariantClearampvarArg             return FALSE                   VariantClearampvarArg            Call Desktop.loadComponentFromURL Method     CComPtrltIDispatchgt cpWorkbook       context change for local variants         VARIANTARG pvarArgs[4]         ZeroMemoryamppvarArgs, sizeofpvarArgs          pvarArgs[3].scode  DISPEPARAMNOTFOUND         pvarArgs[3].vt  VTBSTR         pvarArgs[3].bstrVal  SysAllocStringLprivatefactoryscalc          pvarArgs[2].scode  DISPEPARAMNOTFOUND         pvarArgs[2].vt  VTBSTR         pvarArgs[2].bstrVal  SysAllocStringLblank          pvarArgs[1].scode  DISPEPARAMNOTFOUND         pvarArgs[1].vt  VTI4         pvarArgs[1].lVal  0          SAFEARRAYBOUND saBound         saBound.lLbound  0         saBound.cElements  0         SAFEARRAY psaArgs  SafeArrayCreateVTVARIANT, 1, ampsaBound         pvarArgs[0].scode  DISPEPARAMNOTFOUND         pvarArgs[0].vt  VTARRAY  VTVARIANT         pvarArgs[0].parray  psaArgs          if ActiveXMethodCallcpDesktop, LloadComponentFromURL, 4, pvarArgs, cpWorkbook                      SafeArrayDestroypsaArgs             VariantClearamppvarArgs[3]             VariantClearamppvarArgs[2]             VariantClearamppvarArgs[1]             VariantClearamppvarArgs[0]              return FALSE                   SafeArrayDestroypsaArgs         VariantClearamppvarArgs[3]         VariantClearamppvarArgs[2]         VariantClearamppvarArgs[1]         VariantClearamppvarArgs[0]           return TRUE   unsigned int stdcall thrTestOOCalcvoid vShare      TestOOCalc     return 0   int WINAPI WinMainHINSTANCE hInstance, HINSTANCE hPrevInstance, PSTR szCmdLine, int iCmdShow      if MakeUIWindowhInstance         return 0      TestOOCalc      HANDLE hThread  HANDLEbeginthreadexNULL, 0, thrTestOOCalc, NULL, 0, NULL     WaitForSingleObjecthThread, INFINITE      return 0  codepre

Negative 79573 pWe are creating an installer using WIX 3.6 for a SilverlightWCF application. We require the ability to install multiple instances to give e.g. Live, Test and Demo. Each instance must be able to run a different version and be upgraded independently. This allows a new version to be installed in Test before upgrading Live.p  pI am using the InstanceTransforms mechanism to switch the ProductCode and CustomActions to switch the UpgradeCode for up to 10 instances.p  pI have also managed to create a UI by customising the MaintenanceTypeDlg to allow installing new instance without using the command line. I set MSINEWINSTANCE1 and TRANSFORMSInstance where Instance is the first of my instances that cant be found in the registry before ExecuteInstall.p  pI can also upgrade the default instance through the major upgrade path. Remove and Repair options on AddRemove programs also work correctly.p  pWhere I am having problems is in creating a mechanism for Upgrading, Repairing or Removing a specific instance from the Maintenance dialog.p  pI have created a ComboBox which is populated using a CustomAction with the id and names of all installed instances, but I cannot find a way of reliably passing this information from the InstallUISequence to the InstallExecuteSequence.p  pI have tried specifying TRANSFORMSInstance but the Server MSI deletes the property. I have tried specifying MSIINSTANCEGUID[SelectedGuid], but the server MSI complains that it is an invalid use of the property because it is not a multiple instance install.p  pI managed to get an upgrade install of a specific instance working using the command line with TRANSFORMSInstancetoUpgrade and overwriting the property set by the UpgradeTable to the correct instance ProductCode, however it caches the TRANSFORMS, and always applies that transform if no TRANSFORMS is specified on the command line. The TransformsSecure policy is set, but we will not be able to change this policy on customer sites.p  pI have not been able to find any documentation or examples for MSI or WIX that show the correct properties to set between the InstallUISequence and the InstallExecuteSequence to force the server to Upgrade, Repair or Remove an instance other than the default one in the MSI from which the UI was launched.p  pIf anyone managed to get this or a similar aspect of multiinstance MSIs working, please post any samples of CustomActions, Properties etc, or hints on how to get this working.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI have managed to get a new version MSI to upgrade a specific instance by setting properties UPGRADEFOUNDPreviousInstanceGUID TRANSFORMSInstancep  pHowever if I try and run the MSI again to upgrade a difference instance TRANSFORMS is already set to the one I just upgraded. My UI cannot distinguish between the MSI being doubleclicked or being run from a script to upgraderepair a specific instance. It also looks like the MSI ignores any changes to the TRANSFORMS property on switching to the server when running in Maintenance mode. I need a way of handling the fact that for some instances it will be in maintenance mode and others upgrade mode. In effect I need to be able to rerun FindRelatedProducts and AppSearch when a difference instance is chosen in the UI.p

When I save a Destination I set the Navigation ParameterName to Destination and ParameterValue to the DestinationID.p  pI cant map the Destination to the Navigation because a navigation is not dependant on a destination at all. It could have any model as the ParameterName and the ParameterValue as the ID of that model or both of these could even be null as it is only relevant to a page and not any additional model.p  pSo, when I am either viewing a single destination or looping through a list I need to be able to get the Navigation.FriendlyURL. This is why I have added public virtual Navigation Navigation  get set . In my mapping class though I need to be able to get the Navigation according to a ParameterName of Destination and ParameterValue of Destinations.DestinationID.

Negative 79573 pI need a system that writes sequentially, very fast to a synchronized persistent queue and reads very fast from it. The queue can spike and grow to hundred of millions, possible billions of entries on certain days and it could take days to catchup afterwards, which is fine.p  pIm thinking of something like this p  pReceiving multiple requests containing numbers 04 order doesnt matter p  precodeQueue[10] [ 0 1 2 3 4      ]  codepre  pThe queue is also written to a file f0 concomitant to being submitted to the queue. The reason for this is so in case of failures Im not loosing data.p  pWhile Im reading from it in sequence 0, 1, 2 more numbers are postedp  precodeQueue[10] [    3 4 5 6 7   ]  codepre  pAt this point my file f0 contains 07 and I have also persisted the last position read.p  pIf Im continuing to write and the current queue gets full, the next 10 writes go directly into  a file f1. The next 10 will go into f2 and so on. When the reading finished reading all entries from the queue f1 will be loaded into the queue and the reading will continue. f0 will be deleted. When my reads catch up with the writes the current file will be read into the queue and will continue from that point.p  pI can probably provide a better implementation by using a primarysecondary buffer.p  pHowever I would prefer to use an existing library if there is one that does what I need.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.p  pSebip

Negative 79573 pA simpleand lengthy question, and not a simple answer. Working with some DI frameworksSpring, Guice I came to a conclusion that some of the praxis presented by others is not so simple to implement. I really seem stuck on this level.p  pI will try to present this as simple as possible, even though some of the details will probably be lost. I hope the question will be clear.p  pSay I have a StringValidator, a simple class with a responsibility to validate strings.p  precodepackage test  import java.util.ArrayList import java.util.List  public class StringValidator      private final ListltStringgt stringList     private final ListltStringgt validationList      private final ListltStringgt validatedList  new ArrayListltStringgt      public StringValidatorfinal ListltStringgt stringList, final ListltStringgt validationList          this.stringList  stringList         this.validationList  validationList           public void validate          for String currentString  stringList              for String currentValidation  validationList                  if currentString.equalsIgnoreCasecurrentValidation                      validatedList.addcurrentString                                                  public ListltStringgt getValidatedList          return validatedList       codepre  pThe dependency is the lowest possible, allowing simple tests like thesep  precodepackage test  import org.junit.Assert import org.junit.Test  import java.util.ArrayList import java.util.List  public class StringValidatorTest      Test     public void testValidate throws Exception          Before         ListltStringgt stringList  new ArrayListltStringgt         stringList.addFILE1.txt         stringList.addFILE2.txt          final ListltStringgt validationList  new ArrayListltStringgt         validationList.addFILE1.txt         validationList.addFILE20.txt          final StringValidator stringValidator  new StringValidatorstringList, validationList          When         stringValidator.validate          Then         Assert.assertEquals1, stringValidator.getValidatedList.size         Assert.assertEqualsFILE1.txt, stringValidator.getValidatedList.get0       codepre  pIf we wanted to increase the flexibility even more, we could use Collectionlt instead of Listlt, but lets presume that that wont be necessary.p  pThe classes that create the lists are the followinguse any other interface standardp  precodepackage test  import java.util.List  public interface Stringable      ListltStringgt getStringList   package test  import java.util.ArrayList import java.util.List  public class StringService implements Stringable       private ListltStringgt stringList  new ArrayListltStringgt      public StringService          createList           Simplified     private void createList          stringList.addFILE1.txt         stringList.addFILE1.dat         stringList.addFILE1.pdf         stringList.addFILE1.rdf           Override     public ListltStringgt getStringList          return stringList       codepre  pAndp  precodepackage test  import java.util.List  public interface Validateable      ListltStringgt getValidationList   package test  import java.util.ArrayList import java.util.List  public class ValidationService implements Validateable       private final ListltStringgt validationList  new ArrayListltStringgt      public ValidationService          createList           Simplified...     private void createList          validationList.addFILE1.txt         validationList.addFILE2.txt         validationList.addFILE3.txt         validationList.addFILE4.txt           Override     public ListltStringgt getValidationList          return validationList       codepre  pAnd we have a Main class with a main methodp  precodepackage test  import java.util.List  public class Main      public static void mainString[] args          Validateable validateable  new ValidationService         final ListltStringgt validationList  validateable.getValidationList          Stringable stringable  new StringService         final ListltStringgt stringList  stringable.getStringList          DI         StringValidator stringValidator  new StringValidatorstringList, validationList         stringValidator.validate          Result list         final ListltStringgt validatedList  stringValidator.getValidatedList       codepre  pSo lets say that the classes generate the lists in runtimewhen the user wants to. The directstatic binding is impossible. p  pIf we want to provide the lowest possible coupling, we would use the lists to provide us with data required to run the validationStringValidator.p  pBUT, if we want to use the container to help us with the glue code, we could inject the two services into the StringValidator. That would provide us with the correct data, but at the cost of COUPLING. Also, StringValidator would have the extra responsibility of actually calling the dependencies.p  pIf I use delegation in that way, I clutter my code with unwanted responsibilitesnot something I want.p  pIf I dont, I dont see a way in wich this could workProvider could provide me with the correct lists, but, again, the dependency is there.p  pstrongThe more generic question is  is there a way to actually create a completly decoupled application using DI frameworks, or is this some sort of an ideal In wich situations do you use the DI framework, in wich you dont Are DI frameworks really the new newstrongp  pThank you.p
Negative 79573 pMy site requires users to input a great deal of mathematical and scientific notation.  Naturally, I need a way to store this serverside for future use.  This is my ideal course of action  a user inputs a chunk of text, potentially with or without mathematical symbols, the input is submitted, it is then turned into a format that is suitable for a database, and finally, on every subsequent viewing of the inputted math, it should get converted to MathML.  The MathML is converted to a readable format by MathJax.p  pI have never worked with storing math in a database before, and the fact that I want to allow users to be able to insert math inline with text creates a few implications.

Either that or It is just unclear to me how to implement it, but It looks like it is just different for wordpress.p  pI have almost managed to do it by replacing click with hover in the bootstrapdropdown.js file but then I cant actually move the mouse to the submenu items as the dropdown disappears as soon as I move the cursor and the dropdown doesnt stay open.p  pIdeally it will be on hover for desktop and still on click for mobile but that is not a must. ill sacrifice click on mobile for hover on desktop.p  pIf anyone can help with this, that would be awesome.p
Negative 79573 pI have a complex website that uses .NETs output caching enabled through Sitefinity.  Recently we needed to have a specific user control have different cached versions depending on user location.  So I gave the user control an OutputCache directive with VaryByCustom set and overrode the GetVaryByCustomString method in Global.asax to get the user location.  The problem is that even in a simple test case this is not working.  We tested this use case outside the context of Sitefinity to verify whether it was causing the issue by making a new project containing an .aspx page and placing a new .ascx user control inside of it.  The page has a label that gets the current time on load as well as the control.  The control also has a label that renders the current time.  If I give the page OutputCache set to thisp  precodelt OutputCache Duration60 VaryByParamnone gt codepre  pand the control set to thisp  precodelt OutputCache Duration60 VaryByParamnone VaryByCustombrowser gt codepre  pthe expected functionality does not happen.  The thinking was that if we opened this page in two different browsers we would see two different times in the second label.  Am I completely missing something here  I am new to dealing with .NET caching so it is entirely possible.p  pThanksp  pHere is my override of GetVaryByCustomStringp  precode    public override string GetVaryByCustomStringHttpContext context, string custom              if custom  custom                       return custom logic                  else                      return base.GetVaryByCustomStringcontext, custom               codepre

Negative 79573 pI have a page that Id like to bind dragdrop events to.  Id like the entire page in the browser to be the drop target, so Ive bound my events to the codedocumentcode object.

Negative 79573 pI have a custom widget derived from a GtkVBox which depending on state contains a selection of subwidgets. I want all instances of this custom widget to be of the same height and subwidgets to always be placed at the same position inside this custom widget even if some subwidgets are not visible, i.e. if not all subwidgets are shown I want the space where subwidgets would be shown to be taken up and empty.p  pE.g. consider a GtkVBox which may contain up to four buttons, but sometimes only shows the first and the last button. There should be empty vertical space between the first and last button which corresponds to the space the second and third button would take if they were shown, i.e. with placholders of equivalent size in between.p  pAs far as I understand it I have two optionsp  ol lieither I could use a GtkFixed as a container and do all positioning and sizing code myselfli lior I could create fake buttons, get a size requisition from it, and then add a dummy widget, e.g. an empty GtkLayout of equivalent size as a placeolder to the VBoxli ol  pThe second option is rather hackish but saves me from writing quite a bit of code, are there any downsides to it How would you do it and why, any better ideasp

Negative 79573 pI am programming an app for an experiment by the University of Queensland Psych Department.  The app needs to be impossible to exit, or at least it would be preferable if it were impossible to exit.  This is not a virus it is for an experiment with the Grute Eylandt Aborigines. Anyways, do any of you guys have any idea how to set the app to be impossible to exit, or even better, to set it so that you have to enter a password to exit it  Furthermore, on a separate subject, do you guys have any idea how I can save the information in the app to the iPhone  This app will not go through the App Store so it does not need to follow App Store rules.  Therefore, if there was a way to save Button whatever button it is pushed at time and date to the notes section of the iPhone every time a button was pushed in the app, andor to save audio recorded using the AudioToolbox framework to the actual iPod library, that would be fantastic.  Otherwise I would have to make some sort of db or plist file to save everything with ifthen statements, I think.  Thank youp

Negative 79573 pI have a postgresql operational DB with data partitioned per day and a postgresql data warehouse DB. In order to copy the data quickly from the operational DB to the DWH I would like to copy the tables as fast and with least of resources used. Since the tables are partitioned by day, I understand that each partition is a table as itself. Is that means I can somehow copy the data files between the machines and create the tables in the DWH with those data files What is the best practice in that casep  pEDIT I will answer all questions asked in here 1. Im building an ETL. First step of ETL is to copy the data with less influence on the operational DB. 2. I would want to replicate the data if this wont slow the operational DB writings. 3. A bit more data, The operational DB is not in my responsepbility but the main concern is the write time on the that DB. It writes about 500 Million rows a day where there are hours that are more loaded but there arent hours with no writings at all. 4. I came across with few toolsways  Replication, pgdump. But I couldnt find something that compare the tools to know when to use what and to understand what is fit to my case.p

Negative 79573 pI was following this a hrefhttpvim.wikia.comwikiCcodecompletion relnofollowhttpvim.wikia.comwikiCcodecompletionap  pAt some point it says that when you type something like std A box opens with suggestions.p  pIn my case as soon as I type std I get a message in the bar at the bottom Omni Completion ONP Pattern not foundp  pThis may as well be a mess because no tutorial explains where things go in Windows.p  pFor example before I can install OmniCompletion, I have to install ctags. How I have no idea. At some point I read that I only need ctags.exe under windows. But where do I put it I figured out to put it in the mingwbin directory since it was already in the path.p  pAnd it seems to work. Though when I press C12 instead of indexing the current file, it seems to start indexing my whole home directory in Windows.p  pEvery time I opened a .cpp file it kept saying Pattern not found.p  pI eventually figured out that it works IF I edit a specific file by right clicking on it, and pick edit with Vim from the menu. If instead I launch Vim from its shortcut and THEN open a .cpp file, OmniCompletion fails.p  pThe reason seems to be that edit with Vim gives the program the correct working directory, but if I then open a file that exists somewhere else, OmniCompletion stops working and says it cant find anything.p  pSo, under Windows, what is that tells Vim in which directory to operate, so that I can edit properly different files no matter where they are, and no matter how I opened Vim in the first placep  pAnd how can I run ctags so that it does its job in the current directory where the active file is, instead of wherever it randomly pleasesp

Negative 79573 pI have been struggling to deal with winrm and TrustedHosts but to no avail. The scarce information I found on the web does not help me solve my problem. After some experimenting I found out the this field of winrmconfigclient is limited up to 1023 symbols which is way not enough especially if adding hosts by their ipv6.

Negative 79573 pI have a form which contains a table with two columns. Each row has a checkbox and an input field. While the checkbox is for deletion of the specific row, the input field is for massediting of the values. Each input field uses bean validation. Additionally I have two buttons one for delete and one for save. Everything is based on primefaces.p  precodelthformgt     ltpdataTable valuebackingBean.list varentry idtablegt         ltpcolumngt             ltpselectBooleanCheckbox valueentry.flagDelete gt         ltpcolumngt          ltpcolumngt             ltpinputText valueentry.value gt         ltpcolumngt     ltpdataTablegt      ltpcommandButton valuesave actionListenerbackingBean.save processtable this updatetable gt      ltpcommandButton valuedelete actionListenerbackingBean.delete process[typecheckbox] this updatetable gt lthformgt codepre  pprocess equals execute and update equals render in JSF 2p  pNow it should be possible to delete the selected rows without the validation of the input fields. Therefore I used the primfaces ajax selectors based on jQuery selector API to select only the checkboxes, that should be processed during the ajax request. The values of the input fields are still send to the server but wont be processed. p  pThe problem is the rerender of the table after the ajax request. I want the input fields to preserve the values that got entered before the deletebutton was clicked in case the user did not save his changes with the savebutton. As those values got send to the server, this shouldnt be such a big deal e.g. when the validation fails, I also get the last entered values. But actually I get the values, that are stored in the backing bean. Is there any optionsolution on how to achieve thisp

Negative 79573 pI have a project upgraded from Visual Studio 2010 to 2012 and the .testrunconfig file was included in the upgrade process. p  pI noticed that it was possible to click Analyze code coverage on any of the unit tests that I had run and it would correctly display the result. However, my test run configuration originally from VS 2010 had code coverage disabled.p  pAfter doing a bit of research I learned that the VS 2010 configuration files have been deprecated and replaced by .runsettings files.  It would appear that VS 2012 enforces assembly instrumentation by default which has a massive overhead associated with it.p  pTherefore, I would like to know how I can disable code coverage in VS 2012. Based upon my current findings it does not seem to be a trival task.

Negative 79573 pOk, i am going to keep this simple and not include all the code yet if I dont need to. My inner senses tell me that there is probably a simple answer to this and I have overlooked it as usual. More inexperienced might say the compiler is the problem but I have never known that to be the case 99.999 of the time it has always been an error on my part in some way so... heres the question. I have a program, this program is supposed to output two strings, nothing fancyp  precodeTCHAR firststring  TFirstValue TCHAR secondstring  TSecondValue  tprintfTsn,firststring tprintfTsn,secondstring codepre  pwhich outputs..p  precodefirststring codepre  pin the particular section of my code, this does not work it works elsewhere UNLESS i am stepoverdebugging... then it is fine...p  precodefirststring secondstring codepre  pI have even tried combining the operation into one by doing thisp  precodetprintfTsn[s]n,firststring,secondstring codepre  pMy result is, the first string, and the braces are there to try to point out that the string is trying to be print out and if it is empty, etc. I get this outputp  precodefirststring ] codepre  pand thats it.. again, UNLESS stepover debugging, then its all fine and dandyp  precodefirststring [secondstring] codepre  phas anyone ever heard of a problem like this  The last time I encountered weird problems like this was back in the ASM days with segment alignment but I doubt that is the case here, although I am not sure on tprintfs inner workings... Im going to try this again, if nobody knows, ill assume its because of a error caused by the code earlier. The main question is, does this happen for any simple reason or does this just point to problems earlier in the program, thats all. Thanks for your reply.p  pPS I realize that I didnt supply sufficient code to completely answer the problem, but the question is whether or not there is a known simple cause to this kind of behavior in the debugger run vs. stepover.

Negative 79573 pMy scenario consists of a .NET 4.0 WCF service, called by a .NET 4.5 client wrapped in a class library.p  pThe client calls the WCF service asynchronously, and displays any data it returns.

Negative 79573 pI intend this question to be a more generalized question relating to my question found at the following linkp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15075233solvingdesigninvolvingmultipleinheritanceandcompositeclassesincSolving design involving multiple inheritance and composite classes in cap  pI am working with data sets related to Galaxies. The data about each galaxy will contain information about a galaxies solar systems, each solar systems planets and each planets moons.p  pstrongThe Composite Requirementstrongp  pFrom this alone I imagine that I need to use composite class design where I create a class for the galaxy, the solar systems, the planets and the moons. The galaxy class will contain member container variables which contain pointers to solar systems, planets and moons in addition to the appropriate member getter and setter functions for those container variables. The solar system would have a similarly designed member container variables containing pointers to the contained planets and moons with the getters and setters, and so forth with the planets as well.p  pstrongThe MultipleInheritence Requirementstrongp  pThe types of input data that I use for each of these classes is not constant. At times I have data of type 1 and other times perhaps data of type 2. The different kinds of data that I have for any given project may change as time goes on. In order to avoid having a monsterously growing galaxy class which gets new member variables and functions for each not type of data available for each project as well all of the old and possibly unused in the current project I want to break the galaxy, solarSystem, planet and moon classes up into related classes each specialized to deal with a certain set of data.p  pThus, if I consider two of the possible data sets available to me me, data1 and data2, I may choose to create specific versions of each class for each data set. p  pI like this approach because if I have a new project which requires the combination of data1 and data2 I can create new classes for the galaxy, solarySystem, planet and moon classes that inherit from both of the relevent types before. Something like the following.p  precodeclass GalaxyOneTwo public GalaxyOne, public GalaxyTwo   . . .    class SolarSystemOneTwo public SolarSystemTwo, public SolarSystemOne  . . .  class PlanetOneTwo public PlanetTwo, public PlanetOne  . . .   class MoonOneTwo public MoonTwo, public MoonOne  . . . . codepre  pThis gives me access to all of the veriables and methods for dealing with data1 and data2 AND I can then further define variables and methods for dealing with new properties that arise out of the combination of data1 and data2.p  pstrongThe Problemstrongp  pEach of these design ideas, the composite requirement and the multipleinheritence requirement have worked well on their own for me. But, I would really like to use both. The difficulty in using both is that those container variables within GalaxyOne that give it access to the pointers of SolarSystemOne are of no use to GalaxyOneTwo because the types of pointers in SolarSystemOne do not give access to the member functions of SolarSystemOneTwo.p  pstrongPossible Solutionsstrongp  pemTemplate Base Classem Make a template base class PrimitiveGalaxy, PrimitiveSolarSystem, PrimitivePlanet, PrimitiveMoon which contain all of the container variables and relevant getters and setters from which all further classes inherit. This is the approach I used in the link posted above, and its problems can be found there.p  pemVirtual Base Classem It has been proposed that I create a base class which contains all of the shared functions across all kinds of Galaxies, SolarSystems, Planets and Moons. This would include container variables to the relevant pointers as well as their getters and setters. By doing this the pointers could be used to point to the base class of each type and so long as the base type contained virtual functions for all necessary later defined functions, then I could avoid casting my pointers to the more complex types.p  pMy concern for this approach is that it not only requires the writing of virtual functions in the base class for every new function in derived classes but also that not every derived class will define each virtual function in the base class.p  pThus far, the above possible solution is the only one I currently understand well enough to post.p  pI want a solution that allows for flexible code that does not require complicated syntax and that does not require an every growing and unmanageable series of very large class definitions. My projects regularly include new kinds of data so I want to be able to easily create new parsers for this new data and readily be able to include the data into my various projects using the Galaxy, SolarSystem, Planet and Moon classes.p
Negative 79573 pSo I have the following jQuery blockp  precodevar file  something.html .postload, which file, functiondata    do stuff  codepre  pWhich is supposed to call a backend that loads a file.

For all intents and purposes the backend is just not receiving any POST data.p  pFrom the Network section of my Inspector, I can see that strongthe AJAX call is indeed sentstrong, and the Form Data section contains codewhich something.htmlcode as it should. The request is returned with a 404 Not Found status code. However, I do know that the proper controller is indeed contacted as adding codeecho test exitcode into the controller before it all does indeed return test for the AJAX request.p  pAs far as Ive found solution candidates online, my php.ini should be proper Ive made sure that codevariablesordercode contains codePcode and codepostmaxsizecode is a reasonable size. And as some answerers suggested that it might be an .htaccess redirect thing, I did try adding a trailing slash to the URL that the JS requests, but all to no avail.p  pHeres my .htaccess for referencep  precode Customized error messages.

Negative 79573 pMost of the methodsevents I see around online only return a value for how far down the page the user is currently scrolled. How can I cause the client to actually scroll What I intend to do is have the client scroll down 215px from whereever they currently are after a certain action.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI have this working to scroll down 215px on the event that I wantp  precode.mobiletextfocusfix.focusfunction var top  document.body.scrollTop top  215 window.scrollTo0,top  codepre  pHowever, it appears that this wont allow the client to scroll below 215px from the bottom of the document. If the client is within 215px of the bottom, or at the bottom, it moves up to 215px from the bottom. If the client is just over 215px from the bottom, it only scrolls down to 215px. Im trying to make the client scroll down 215px, or if they are less than 215px from the bottom of the document, then scroll all the way down.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pMy current code is calculating the height of the document once and scrolling based on its innitial calculation each time, which was causing the strange issue mentioned in the paragraph above this. p  pHowever, my document changes size based on xml injected to the body, and I also need to be able to scroll the client down 215px, or to the bottom of the bottom of the document if theyre already within 215px of the bottom, each time the user performs a specific action. p  pThis action which may occur multiple times while scrolled at different heights, or with different content placed on the page via xml which will change the document height. So basically, how can I perform the same task that the code I have above is doing, but while recalculating the document height each timep

Negative 79573 pI want to use some letters  keys  as shortcut for some actions in javascript.  I want to check whether the cursor is focused on any textfield, form input, etc. so that the shortcut action will be canceled when user is typing something in a form or textfield.p  pFor example, i want an alert to be executed when user presses A. But if the user is typing  some text in a textarea like A website then he will be pressing A, this time alert should not be executed.p
Negative 79573 pive coded some program which pretends to stablish a connection, and then send a packet of data by using rawsockets in linux, and the C language.p  pafortunately, ive implemented okay the program, since a connection is stablished. The problem ive now is that i can not spend so much time, for guessing how a pshack data packet must be filled, by receiving the ACK from server, and also to can see the data onto the netcats output buffer...p  pso, please, can anyone help to format the packet Ive spent so many time, and giving you a complete log of the traffic would be easy.p  pThanks in advance. Hope a suggestion in an early time... .p  pP.S if not clear, i pretend to implement my own userspace tcp stack just for speedy up the processes of tcp networking, just for embed a networking process in a nonblocking program execution, and a fast resultset of networking processes.p  pAs some of you may be know, linux boxes automagically sends an answer to a server which sent and SYNACK, but RST the connection, and making not possible to stablish a connection by implementing the TCP stack. So, I should say, Im using the grsecs protection called TCPUDP blackhole DoS prevention, which prevents the Linux Kernel of sending not wished responses to incoherent network traffic.p  pThats all.p
Negative 79573 pIm using an spexecutesql so I can be flexible with what I choose to return. Im encountering a problem when attempted to return data where there is none. p  pSay for instance Im attempting to find all rows where there is no owner assigned. Currently, my query is written as follows. p  precode if owner ltgt      Begin         SELECT sql  sql  and owner LIKE owner     END codepre  pThis allows for me to not have to select an owner. If I do, it will of course be included in my query.p  pSince Im now attempting to add a line that would basically allow me to just bring back unassigned ownersp  precode if owner  Unassigned BEGIN     SELECT sql  sql  and owner IS NULL  END codepre  pHowever, when Im doing this, it will bring back the entire list.

Negative 79573 pI have blender tool to create the 3D objects for OpenGL ES for android. I have tried the example in blender and exported the .obj file and .mtl file.

The texture coords are not extracted by codeobj2opengl.plcode file. How can I generate the .obj file with textures using blender and how can i extract itp  pPlease, let me know proper tutorials for blender to openGL ES export.

Negative 79573 pWe got a project called Main. In this project, all our resources are in a folder called Ress.

I would rather have me log in to my website and after that have access to it.p  pWhat I would like is that I dont open port 8083 externalyremove the username and password from the service also, but rather include the site running on localhost8083 if the user is logged inn.p  pSo I would like a couchpotato.php file with something like thisp  precodeif SESSION[username]  true      echo ltiframe srchttplocalhost8082gtltiframegt  codepre  pHovever that obviously doesnt work.p  pWhat would be the best solution to implement thisp

Negative 79573 pMy current assignment is to move rows of data between 2 Kendo Ui grids when a user clicks a button in that row. I have code that actually works, but I dont understand why and was hoping someone could explain it. I am also wondering if there is a better approach or one that makes sense to accomplish this task. The environment is Winsows 7, VS2012, MVC4, Kendo UI, jquery 1.8. The part I dont understand is the moveTo function. The part starting with     var row  elem.currentTarget.closesttr and the whole toDS.add.... is very confusing. It seems like to me that Im looping through each cell in the row and adding that to the toDs, but why all the fields Seems like I should be doing something like what is commented out below that, but that doesnt work.p  pOther things to note. I have seen a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netOnaBai2qXKy relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netOnaBai2qXKya but the customer does not want to use selections in the grids, they want to have individual buttons.

Negative 79573 pIm developing a workflow service which will contain in the end a lot of different workflows used to interact with users.p  pAs such, these workflows will need to publish messages to the users, and these messages need to be localized.p  pI wanted to use RESX files and add an extra parameter when initiating a workflow to set the required culture.p  pThis, however, appeared to fail, as the WF service especially when it comes to persistance creates new threads as needed and despite setting the current culture at the start and working for a bit, in the end my workflow would return to the default culture.p  pIve also tried setting the codeCulturecode parameter of the static classes created by RESX files, but this seems to change the culture across the board for all running workflows which will likely need to be running in different locales.p  pIs there any way to tackle this problemp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI know I could use a codeResourceManagercode class, because I can pass the culture I want to use, but then instead of using the strongly typed resource names available in the generated classes I need to use strings  and its easy to make a mistake.p  pstrongEDIT 2strongp  pOne more thing I forgot to mention  but it ties a bit to the last edit about the codeResourceManagercode.

Negative 79573 pGenerically, Im wondering how I would store secondary data based on the type of primary data.p  pHeres the realworld situation.  When adding students to my database, I want to start their referral.  This will be done by referencing a table called referrer that stores a list of options that will appear in a dropdown box, as suchp  precode  referrerid  referrer                   1        Student             2  Search Engine             3             Ad   codepre  pSo in the students table, Ill store the referrerid  Easy enough.p  pBased on the selection, Id like the user to be able to enter secondary information.  For instance, if they choose Student from the list, a second dropdown box will appear presenting them with a list of existing students so they can specify which student was the referrer, and I would want to store the studentid.  If they chose either Search Engine, I would present them with a text box where they can enter the name of the search engine, and I would store that text.p  pSo my question is, how should me students table be structured in order to hold this information, since sometimes Ill be storing a studentid, or the text entered in a box, or...   My initial thought is to create additional columns in the students table to hold the various possibilities, but that seems both messy and not scalable, so I dont care for it.  Im wondering if an additional crossreference table would be warranted here, that would hold the studentid, the referrerid, and then a value such as the referring studentid, or the value entered into the text box.  Or perhaps instead of value, I could have valueid, valuetext, and so on for different data type possibilities.  The value of referrerid in this table would tell me which column contains the data I want.  While this seems cleaner than expanding out the students table, it does still seem a bit messy.p

If the application you are running in a web browser is still complaining that the memory size is not above codevalue Ycode, a value that is hardcoded into the application to check, and we assume that we know that this check to be functional and correct, what steps can be taken to see why the app in question is not getting this modified heap size settingp  pstrongeditstrong One possible cause of this is if you set a 32 bit JRE to more than 2 Gb or so of memory, as it will not handle it. 1024 should propagate, and my way of solving this was simply to disable different JREs that I found on the system until I found out which one was being used.p

Negative 79573 pI have tried to search an answer for this all over. It seems pretty straightforward, but my lack of knowledge of Javascript Been coding in Java all along combined with Image stream conversion on Javascript side makes this hard.p  pI make a REST request url  codehttpsltlthostgtportgetPicturecode and it produces a codeimagejpegcode streaming response.p  pOnce I fire the URL in Chrome browser  the image is rendered correctly. It is also rendered in my angularJS app  via ngsrc tag e.g. codeltimg ngsrcurlgtcodep  pHowever, when I try to set the raw data to ngsrc tag, it does not seem to work. On further reading I understood that ngsrc does not accept raw image data, but needs to be converted to a base64String to be used as a DataURI.

Negative 79573 pSo Im working on a game and I have a model of a character, in Milkshapes he appears to be textured correctly. However in Unity the material for his eye and his body does not seem to be the correct material. Both the eye and the body of the character seem to be using a new material No Name that doesnt exist in Milkshapes. While the body looks okay, the eye doesnt and neither are even using the right material. Both are using the same character out of the same folder located in the Unity project.p  pimg srchttpi.imgur.comWu4Tb3Z.png altImagep  pI am almost 100 sure that Unity imported the model incorrectly, if you can help me fix this thatd be great.p

Negative 79573 pI am writing a shared library that I am deploying under Windows, Linux and Mac. On the Linux side, I am attempting to make sure that my library has as few dependencies as possible.

Can anyone tell me whether this list of dependencies is reasonable, or whether I can get rid of some of these With this list of dependencies, will my library run on a wide array of Linux configurations and distros That is what I am aiming for, maximum portability.p  pWhen compiling, I am specifying the flag staticlibgcc. Are there any more flags I can specify to link in the C standard library as well, for example Internally my library uses stdthread in C11, but I dont want to force the application writer to necessarily have that available if they are using an older version of GCC for instance.p  pUpdatep  pI am now specifying staticlibstdc, in addition to staticlibgcc. My dependency list now looks as followsp  precode    linuxgate.so.1 gt  0xf57fe000                                             libpthread.so.0 gt libi386linuxgnulibpthread.so.0 0xb7737000          libc.so.6 gt libi386linuxgnulibc.so.6 0xb7584000                      libldlinux.so.2 0xb77a2000                                          codepre  pThe only ones that cause me concern are libc.so.6, and linuxgate.so.1. I dont know what these are. Are they old, and if so have they remained backwards compatible for a long time If so I will just keep them linking dynamically, but otherwise I have to continue investigating. Any tips would be appreciated.p

Negative 79573 pIn my 2D tile based game, the player can paint tiles to change there color. The simple approach and what I have already done is to use the codetintcode parameter in codeSpriteBatch.Drawcode.p  pThis looks nice, and here is an examplep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comf61Ww.png altenter image description herep  pBut say, I want to paint the wood white. If you have ever messed with the tint, you know this isnt possible using the tint parameter. codeColor.Whitecode will tint the sprite the default color, and not white. This isnt a major problem, but I suppose some users might want it.p  pMy question is, is there a method to color a sprite based on huesaturation instead of tint. Similar to the colorify function in GIMP.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comXIdCR.png althttpgyazo.comeaa8d54d82a15ce05b006b084e71803f.pngp  pAn obvious approach would to be to use this function in GIMP and just export sprites for each color. The trouble comes in at the fact that this would take forever to do for all my sprites, and each sprite has multiple variations, meaning you could have in total 100 combos for one block type.p  pIs this possible I suppose a shader might get the job done.p

Negative 79573 pIm having an issue with OpenJPA. I used it to persist values in MySQL DB. Amoung these values, theres a String value that has a spanish character . The data was persisted correctly, with the special character being shown perfectly in the DB.p  pThe problem comes when, within my Java program, I try to query the DB with one of the parameters having this special character. Heres an examplep  precode    private static final String getPerdiodoEstadoAfiliacionParaOS           SELECT x FROM PeriodoAfiliacion x WHERE               x.obraSocial1               AND x.tipoPeriodoAfiliacion LIKE 2      public static ListltPeriodoAfiliaciongt getPerdiodoEstadoAfiliacionParaOSEntityManager em, ObraSocial os, String periodoABuscar          ifosnull return new ArrayListltPeriodoAfiliaciongt          Query query  em.createQuerygetPerdiodoEstadoAfiliacionParaOS         query.setParameter1, os         query.setParameter2, periodoABuscar         return query.getResultList      codepre  pSo, parameter number 2 the one shown as 2, its a string with a special character in it. The query comes back empty when theres actually data.p  pI know the problem is the special character, because if I pass as a parameter another String that doesnt have the special character in it, the query comes back with results as expected.p  pSo, I dont know what the problem is really. I guess it has something to do with the way the parameter is passed from OpenJPA to the DB engine.p  pDo you guys have suggestionsp

Negative 79573 pI have a basic MSI installer for a .NET application, which has been configured to require .NET 4 client profile be installed on the system.  I have done this via ApplicationDataRedistributables by checking Microsoft .NET Framework 4 Client.  It is already downloaded Location is Installed Locally, and in its properties, I have it set to Copy From Source.  Then, in its release configuration in MediaRelease, it is configured to Extract from Setup.exe for Installshield Prerequisite Location.p  pNow here is the problem when I install on a specific machine, which has only .NET 3.5, it simply ignores the prerequisite and allows for the program to install without it.  Is there more I have to do in order to bundle the .NET installer with my Setup.exe and force it to be installed or cancel the installation  If not, why would it not workp  pUpdatesp  ol liI have had this problem on Windows XP and Windows Server 2008 R2 Standard.li liI turned on logging to see if I could gather some useful information.  When I check the package in the required software of the Project Assistant Installation Requirements view, the log shows it trying to find it in AppSearch, returning not found, and then immediately terminating the install.  It doesnt even give the option of installing it, despite including the .NET install package in the installer.  When I uncheck the option in the Installation Requirements view, it bypasses searching for the .NET version in AppSearch and continues with the installation without any references to .NET.li liI discovered that by changing from .NET 4 Client to .NET 4 Full installer prerequisite, that it works correctly.  Something must be wrong with the .NET 4 Client installer prerequisite settings.li ol

To prevent this, you can dop  precodedefine mina, b typeofa a  a      typeofb b  b      a lt b  a  b codepre  pThis works great under GCC, but if you run it through Clang with codeWgnucode setthis set of warnings falls under the umbrella of codepedanticcodeyou get errors likep  precodetest.c510 error use of GNU statement expression extension [Werror,Wgnu]         int a  min3, 7                  test.c122 note expanded from macro min   define mina, b typeofa a  a typeofb b  b a lt b  a  b codepre  pIs it possible to define these macros in a way that prevents double evaluation emandem which is acceptable to Clang under codepedanticcode Yes, you can disable the warning with codeWnognucode, in which case Clang handles the statement expression without a problem.

Negative 79573 pThe aim of the program Im writing is to implement a genetic algorithm to develop playing strategies for the stochastic game Piglet. To begin with, I have an array holding all the strategies, and I pass the array with one index specified to the fitness function. Just to check everything was working fine, I had it print the strategy only had 1 in the population at this point for the sake of simplicity of these tests. And well.. it kinda worked I had a 10x10x10 array of zeroes and ones which its supposed to do, but the program carried on printing numbers sometimes blocks of zeroes, sometimes blocks of ridiculously large numbers. I think my call of fitness might be the issue..

Negative 79573 pCan anyone think of a good way to sync a mysql database with another mysql database before the server starts up I thought maybe i could rsync the directories in rc.d, but that seems dicey.   The servers running on FreeBSD.p  pThanks.p  pFor clarificationp  pAlright.  I am setting up mysql as a session store for a php web application.  I have written a class that overrides phps session methods with methods that offer benefits important to our web app.  In the interest of the maximum speed, the main mysql server is storing its data in a tmpfs partition.  It replicates to a server with an SSD.p  pIn the event of a failure, my session management class will automatically roll over to the slave, but when the master reboots, and the mysql service starts, session requests will be redirected at it, but there will be no data present.  Ergo, I need to get the data from the slave during the boot sequence of the master.p

Negative 79573 pIn my CS110 class, we are developing an Android application using the Google Maps API and one of the concepts being taught the Observer design pattern. The design pattern teaches the concept of a publisher and a subscriber. So when the state of the publisher changes, it notifies all the subscribers. In this example, the LocationListener is a subscriber but the implementation is confusing.p  pA snippet of the code looks as followsp  precodeLocationListener locationListener  new LocationListener    public void onLocationChangedLocation location     Called when a new location is found by the network location provider.   makeUseOfNewLocationlocation      public void onStatusChangedString provider, int status, Bundle extras    public void onProviderEnabledString provider    public void onProviderDisabledString provider   codepre  pLocationListener is an interface, and my understanding is you cant instantiate an interface. Yet, the codeLocationListener locationListener...code statement is creating an object from an codeInterfacecode, how is this possiblep  pAlso, my understanding is this is an Anonymous class. Im not quite sure I understand what it means for a class to be Anonymous. I understand what the word anonymous means, but not in the context of a class.p  pAny help in clarifying what is happening here would be greatly appreciated.p

Is it possible to somehow detect where the finger is before dropping Is it possible to limit the dragging to the straight x and y axis Or is there a way to know the direction of that dragging movement, allowing me to 1 know the object I would swap with and 2 moving the other object before the drop, making it look like the objects are just swappingp  pstrongEditstrong I got the direction, since I can calculate it from codeview.getXcode, codeview.getYcode coords are inside my startobject and codev.getXcode and codev.getYcode coords from the object Im over in onDrag when the dragEvent is ACTIONENTERED.br Now I try to figure out either how to set the dragshadows position to the object I want it to be over, or to only allow dragging in my direction and ending the drag over the next object.br Further help or ideas still appreciated.p

Negative 79573 pI just have a general question about setting an Access query to Dynaset Inconsistent Updates. I know it opens up the fields for editing and this increases the risk of maintaining data integrity, but what about in controlled casesp  pFor example, I have a table on the one side of 3 left outer joins. I want to allow edits via a form to any fields on the one side. The 3 outer joins are merely pulling information from these other tables to use in a calculated field in that query. So I need to show these calculations at this query level, but edit the primary table in the query. I know the changes Im allowing in the form are just on the one side. Is this an allowable case for using Dynaset Inconsistent Updates I just cant figure out an appropriate solution. I tried using a subquery for the one field instead of outer joins but that still left it locked.p

Negative 79573 pI have a server application that must communicate with a separate server monitor application. The server monitor should display information to the user such as what clients are connected to the server.p  pMy problem is that I cannot expose the server data to the WCF service for the server monitor to access. I know that I could use public methods on the WCF service and set it using some kind of password, but this seems like a really gross way to do it.p  pIs there a way to expose WCF service methods to only the hosting application so that I can set the available data Failing that, is there any alternative way for me to achieve the desired resultsp

Negative 79573 pI have a database trigger which executes on insertion of data. From the application end, I use hibernate to update the same table which is update by the database TRIGGER. The data which was updated by Trigger gets overwritten by the older data when I update the data from the application end.I figured out that the cached value in hibernate is not in sych with the value from the database. Is there a proper way to get around this The cache I am talking about is First level cache.p  pEDIT  Hibernate should update certain fields in the database and other fields in the database should be updated by the TRIGGER.

However, instead of producing a map showing all of the points from my KML file, all I get is the default map, the same as if I never added the kml layer in my map.html file.

Negative 79573 pI have an Android app source code which uses 1 Android SDK Obviously 2 Robolectric for unit tests 3 Gradle for build processp  pThe problem encounter while trying to use the other build process is that Im required go into my repo and fetch the Android SDK every time and extract it. Then, clean and run my tests and jacocoTestReport. This takes time not due to the number of tests but, due to the amount of time spent fetching Android SDK and extracting. On my local machine, I can use Jenkins with Android plugin.p  pMy question  Am I doing it right  Is there an easier way around this to reduce the build time so that I can put a POST hook over my repo for it to run better Only take up time required to run tests and reports.p
Negative 79573 pSo I am trying to optimize some code that I am working with. The code is a somewhat generic search utility that is written for a website generator. p  pCurrently the search recurses through a given base directory searching for a string and returns the last instance of any directory with that name, or the first instance of any nondirectory it finds. p  pEx p  precodepublic static File findFileFile baseDir, String name throws IOException      File match  null     for File f  findFilesbaseDir, name         if match  null                   match.isDirectory                   matchesFilename, f gt matchesFilename, match             match  f                   return match   public static SetltFilegt findFilesFile baseDir, String name throws IOException      SetltFilegt files  new HashSetltFilegt      for File f  baseDir.listFiles          if f.isDirectory             if matchesFilename, f gt 0                 files.addf                      else                           files.addAllfindFilesf, name              if matchesFilename, f gt 0                 files.addf                                 if matchesFilename, baseDir gt 0         files.addbaseDir           return files  codepre  pAs this is a fairly large build taking up to an hour and my machine is rather slow I would like to optimize this a bit.

Negative 79573 pI have a button which has an action that gives a push to another view. My goal is to make this button to open different views according to the selected segment. For example I have a button called Request and have a control segment with two segments, called Pizza Salt and Sweet Pizza. When selected, for example, Pizza Salt in the segment and then immediately click the Request button, I want to open a view to the menu of Salt Pizza., And selected Sweet Pizza I want the button to open another view with the menu of the Sweet Pizza. p  pNote I already have the two controllers ready with views. p  pWhat code do I usep  pMy code p  precode IBActionchangeButtonCodeidsender      if firstSegmentSixthView.selectedSegmentIndex  0    IBActionpushToNextViewidsender     codepre
Negative 79573 pIve been using the Javascript module pattern recently, and all of it makes crystal clear sense to me except for one thing preventing public methods from being called more than once. p  pFor instance, I may have some javascript that runs on page load that is a public method on the module that sets up buttons and actions, as well as determining visibility of elements, etc. I dont want someone to be able to call that code a second time because it could wreck the intended look and functionality of the page, and quite frankly, I cant think of a reason why I would want anyone to even know the method exists after the first call.p  pOne way to achieve this functionality would be to have a private boolean tracking whether these public methods were called, then the next time through, bail instead of executing. This is fairly common in every programming language, and could be accomplished as seen below.p  precodevar Module  function      var showHelloWorld  function          jQuerydiv.textHello World     ,      init  function          if initCalled              console.logInit was already called             return                   showHelloWorld          initCalled  true     ,      initCalled  false      return          init  init        jQueryfunction      Module.init       This will not break, it will log that init was called already and bail     Module.init  codepre  pHowever, the public function remains in such a situation, and even though future calls to the method would effectively do nothing, the method still sticks around for people to see if they dig around in the console, etc. p  pThe root of my question is, why not just delete these sorts of public methods from the module after theyre called Is there a reason we wouldnt want to do this I tried to search the web for discussions on this sort of situation, but I havent found anything related to the topic. The following code attempts to explain my idea p  precodevar Module  function       var showHelloWorld  function          jQuerydiv.textHello World     ,      init  function          showHelloWorld           LOOK HERE         delete this.init          LOOK HERE           return          init  init        jQueryfunction      Module.init       THIS IS GOING TO BREAK     Module.init  codepre  pAfter the first call to the init method, we could just delete the public method and not worry about it anymore.p  pCan anyone tell me why this is a bad idea or why it shouldnt be done Im sure this is a silly question, but I cant find any resources on the topic. Thanks in advancep

Negative 79573 pI am trying to optimize a code that I had to refactor. The code without any optimizations would have some switch statements.

I would like to avoid checking the condition every time. Are there any suggestions how I could improve this code Any switchrefactoring tricksp  pEDIT I know that this example may look dumb as the refactoring there wouldnt look very useful but the actual code that I am refactoring really needs it belive me so I am trying not to loose performance in the final code. p

Negative 79573 pIve created an codengbindcode element in my template, which displays a number rounded by one decimal. How do I add a codecode to the end of it, from within the codengbindcode logicp  pMy codep  precodeltspan ngbindvariable  number 1        classanimated ngshowvariable        ngclassfadeInvariablegtltspangt codepre  pResults in for example code4.5code but I want it to be code4.5code.p  pThe thing is, I want to add a codecodecharacter to the end of it, but how Id rather not add a second span, with the exact same logic, just for that one character, and codengbindvariable    number 1code is not working. Id also like to avoid extra code in my controllersdirectives, since I think this is more a template thing and I only need to use it just a few times.p
Negative 79573 pMy application has a dashboard screen which has many charts showing metrics and results of user activity, sales performance, etc. p  pThese results can be filtered by date, user and many other options. Supposing Ive got one query for each chart, strongwhats the best way to apply the same filtering rule in these  multiple queriesstrong  Whats the best way to replicate the same where clause the same filtering rule accross many queriesp  pAs example,p  blockquote   pSELECT  FROM users WHERE date  20141003p      pSELECT  FROM products WHERE date  20141003p blockquote  pBoth queries have same rules. Some suggested to set a variable with this rule and concatenate it to other queries. Something likep  blockquote   pwhere  WHERE date  20141003p      pquery  SELECT  FROM users . wherep      p...p      pquery  SELECT  FROM products . wherep      p...p blockquote  pBut I cant see this as a good pratice.p

Negative 79573 pI just recently figured out that my Minitest test cases can run in parallel. All I had to do wasp  precoderequire minitesthell codepre  pand so I did. Unfortunately, my tests run exactly like before. Everything passes and it takes exactly as much time as it usually does.

Negative 79573 pIm trying to make a formtable builder for surveys and such. For the table, Id like to be able to reorder the columns in the admin part of the application. That way I can save this structure in the database and generate the table for the clients that want to fill in the survey.p  pFor this, Im using a js library I found called dragtable a hrefhttpsgithub.comakottrdragtable relnofollowhttpsgithub.comakottrdragtableap  pThis works very good and is what I need, but the problem is that it doesnt support my colspans when I have multiple choice columns like rate from 1 to 5. I should be able to drag and drop the Antwoord 1 with the 5 radiobuttons for the rating over the Antwoord 2 for example. Ive already tried changing alot in the datatable.js see my commented out code in it. p  pI know the colspan should be added somewhere in the function bubbleCols starting from line 117, but I cant solve it.p  pOn this link is what I already havep  pa hrefhttpjsbin.comsuzukuhogibo1edithtml,js,output relnofollowhttpjsbin.comsuzukuhogibo1edithtml,js,outputap  pAnyone that can take a look and maybe knows what I should addchange to make it workingp

I figure this here is where I check for conditional statements, and I will need to check for the codecode and codecode symbols, get all three subexpressions, evaluate the conditional expression, and select one of the last two subexpressions to push onto the operand stack. Atleast thats how I understand it. Im not so sure what to do about the comparisons though.p  pI realize there is a similar question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3262889addingconditionalsfunctionstoamathparserAdding Conditionals amp Functions to a Math Parserap  pBut Im using C.NET I cant figure out how to adapt whats done there to my code. Im not asking that you write the code for me not that I would complain much xP, but I really need a starting point. What steps do I need to take to get this done.p

Negative 79573 pMy question is exactly as the title says.p  pThe reason I ask this question is that I need to workaround a wrong design. Simply speaking, my task is to implement the body of a callback function. The callback function receives a single argument of codeiTextSharp.text.Documentcode and other noniTextSharp data. The callback function will then add content image, text, etc. to the codeDocumentcode. It does not receive a codePdfWritercode or codePdfContentBytecode argument. The callback function will not be able to ask its caller for anything else.p  pAccording to the Chapter 1.3.2 of the book iText in Action, the codeiTextSharp.text.Documentcode object allows one to add strongemhighlevel objectsemstrong to the PDF, whereas codePdfWritercode or its underlying codePdfContentBytecode would be needed if anyone needs to add strongemlowlevel contentemstrong.p  pThe design mistake was that the previous software design requirement only specifies the need to add content which are covered by the highlevel objects. Now the requirement has changed I have to add lowlevel content as well. However, the callback interface was based on the previous requirement and was not changeable due to semitechnical issues.p  pIn particular, I have to apply codesetRGBColorFillFcode on some content. This is the reason I need access to the lowlevel writer.p  pMy detailed question is thereforep  ul liIs it possible to access codePdfWritercode or codePdfContentBytecode when given codeiTextSharp.text.Documentcode aloneli liIf no, is it possible to construct either codePdfWritercode or codePdfContentBytecode separately on a different document or stream, populate it with the content to be added, and then converted into a form that can be added back to the instance of codeDocumentcode that was given to the callback functionli ul  pFrom my reading of other Stackoverflow question, neither is possible. However, because of the difficulty for asking to change the interface, I thought it would be prudent for me to ask once again.p  hr  h3Remark 1.h3  pFor those who insist on knowing the difficulty of changing the interface, the misdesigned interface is already inthewild, and therefore any future change means that clients using the previous interface will be missing the feature the content that is added by the callback function if the callback implementation requires a correctlydesigned interface.p  hr  h3Remark 2. h3  pI am aware of the correct way to get the PdfContentByte, as in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16932904howtoimplementgetdirectcontentitextsharpthis answera. I also blame myself for suggesting the wrong interface to another project team much earlier in the process without fully realizing what is meant in the five steps described in the Chapter 1.3 Creating a PDF document in five steps.p
Negative 79573 pFrom what I have seen with Angular 2.0, I have a feeling I am going to be using Angular 1.x for a while.  It has all the building blocks that I think I need, the only downside is that it does have performance issue with dirty checking so I am trying to think about that more.  Now ngrepeat can be an issue because of the number of watchers it adds.p  pSo I have this part of a template in jadep  precodelingrepeattopMenuItem in sideMenu.topMenu, ngclassisactive topMenuItem.display  sideMenu.activeTopMenu   ahref topMenuItem.href   topMenuItem.display      ulngifsideMenu.secondMenu.length gt 0 ampamp topMenuItem.display  sideMenu.activeTopMenu       lingrepeatsecondMenuItem in sideMenu.secondMenu, ngclassisactive secondMenuItem.display  sideMenu.activeSecondMenu         ahref secondMenuItem.href   secondMenuItem.display  codepre  pWhen this displays 22 menu items the number of watchers is 90 using a hrefhttpblog.yodersolutions.comangularjscountthenumberofwatchersonapage relnofollowthisa bookmark snippet.p  pI decided to play around with trying to use interpolate to generate that menu.

This version only has 16 watchers and that number does not increase when more elements are shown where the ngrepeat does.p  pSince this code is only doing the bare minimum that is needed for this piece of code to work, I imagine the javascript itself is just as efficient if not more efficient than the code that executes for ngrepeat.p  pIs that assumption correctp  pAre there any issues with doing looping DOM generation in this way vs using ngrepeatp

Negative 79573 pIm developping a windows form application in managed C, compiled for AnyCPU using Visual Studio 2008 and .NET3.5.brbr When debugging on a 32bit PC, everything works fine.brbr When debugging on a 64bit PC, the app crashes due to an access violation that occurs within a 3rd party 32bit native DLL, part of a USB camera API, that I wrapped into a managed DLL. The native function call that fails has only one int32 argument, which is correctly initialized. That API call being the first one, I can see in the debugger output window that it correctly triggers the loading of the native 32bits DLL and all its dependencies from the SysWoW64 directory.brbr I precise that I dont have access to the source code of the native DLL which is provided with minimum documentation and no support by the camera manufacturer.brbr My question is twofoldbrbr 1  Apart from a buggy native DLL, what could explain the different behavior we observe for the same 32bit app running on a 32bit or a 64bit machine brbr 2  Although I know it may sound as bad design, Id like to catch the access violation to prevent that DLL call from leading to an app crash. Indeed, the app manages many different instruments so it should rather catch and signal the error rather than abruptly stop its execution because of only one instrument. So I tried to put the native dll call first within a strongemtrycatch blockemstrong, then using a strongemtryexcept blockemstrong with the SEH compiler option, but I cant seem to catch the error the program always terminates at the native function call. Even when the debugger does catch it by selecting access violation in emDebugExceptionsem, it doesnt pass it on to the app and my handler block is never reached... I spent hours searching SO for similar issues but, although I did find nice posts on the SEH, I couldnt find the solution to this one. Any idea  Did I miss something with the SEH brbr Thanks for your help.p

Negative 79573 pIm building a Laravel application. I need to discriminate between a guest, an admin and an owner. I plan on using Confide and Entrust.

The owner can get a view on all projects of all registered users, can also see stats on how many projects and tasks, how many users are using the app, reset passwords for a given users, ticketing system etc....p  pI would create three roles guest, admin and owner using Entrust.

Negative 79573 pHello I have a java program here and I am trying to make a progress bar. The while loop is within another class and will take a while to run so this GUI is supposed to show progress. While the while loop is running, however, the bar does not move until the while loop is finished then the bar is at 100. Inside the while loop I have my normal stuff and then I addedp  precodeWindowWin.pb.setValuegetPercent codepre  pThis, however doesnt seem to actually initiate until the loop is over or on the final run through of the loop. While searching on here Ive seen suggestions to use p  precodepublic static void progressUpdate       SwingUtilities.invokeLaternew Runnable           public void run               WindowWin.pb.setValuegetPercent                  codepre  pIm probably not using this right, or this is probably not the fix for my situation.

Negative 79573 pI have a project in Access where we are using tables that have the customers information.  These tables were created by downloading as Excel from another site of ours and then uploading to the Access program.br The problem is that the information on our other site changes sometimes, and we really dont know what has changed on our existing information.  When we append a new Excel download it will add customeraccountIDs that are not on the table yet, but I need a way of finding out if there are any changes to the existing information.  I have tried an update query, but that makes forms that have a relationship to the customer information tables not show the detail section.  From what I have researched, this is possibly due to the update query making the updated table read only.br I have taken an made a query that gives me a list of all the duplicates between the newly downloaded Excel  and the existing table, but now I need some way to find if there is any changes.  There are 60 columns where there could be changes.br We are not against manually updated our tables if we can find a way of finding out what has changed.br I have considered downloading the duplicates report to excel and running a formula using exacta2a61,b2b61, but then I would have to copy that formula to every other row through thousands of rows.  I have no preference to whether we find the changes by Excel or Access.br The best way would be to have Access replace the information when appending the new information, not just drop the duplicates.  Which would mean having Access replace the existing data when appending.  Is that possible or can a report be created that shows where the information differsp

Negative 79573 pIm wondering if Futures are better to be used in conjunction with Actors only, rather than in a program that does not use Actor. Said differently, is performing asynchronous computation with future something that should better be done within an Actors system p  pHere why im saying that p  p1  You perform a computation for which the result, would trigger some action that you may do in another thread. p  pFor instance, i have a long operation to determine the price of something, from my main thread, i decide to launch an asynchronous process for it. In the mean time i could be doing other thing, then when the response is readyavailble or communicated back to me, i go on on that path. p  pI can see that with actor this is handy, because you can pipe a result to an actor. But with a typical threading model, you can either block or .... p  p2  Another issue, let say i need to update the age of a list of participant, by getting some information online. Let assume i just have one future for that task. Isnt closing over the participant list something wrong to do. Multiple thread maybe accessing that participant list at the same time. So making the update within the future would simply be wrong and in that case, we would need java concurrent collection isnt it  p  blockquote   pMaybe i see it the wrong way, future are not meant to do side effect   at allp blockquote  pBut in that case, fair enough, no side effect, but we still have the problem of getting a value back from the calling thread, which can only be blocking. I mean lets imagine that, the result, would help the calling thread, to update some data structure. How to do that update asynchronously without closing over that data structure somehow.p  blockquote   pI believe the call backs such as OnComplete can be use for   sideeffecting Am it right herep blockquote  pstill, the call back would have to close over the data structure anyway. Hence i dont see how not using Actor.p  pPS I like actors, im just trying to understand better the usage of future without actors. I read everywhere, that one should use actor only when necessary that is when state need to be manage. It seems to me that overall, using future, without actor, always involve blocking somewhere down the line, if the result need to be communicated back at some point to the thread that initiated the asynchronous task. p

Negative 79573 pim developing a node.js backend for a realtime chat app on heroku. As im looking at dynos and ways to scale the node.js backend, i can see the advantage that dynos could have on http servers because each dyno can be independent from other dynos which is ok for most cases.p  pMy question is how can you scale and handle load balancing of realtime socket.io apps From what im reading dynos are containers that are sandboxed each dyno runs its own process, independent from the other dynos.. so what is the best way to handle the problemp  pI was thinking of a solution but it isnt elegant or pretty at allp  pi could have multiple background jobs that contain crons that can check for new messages for the users connected on that instance.. but i think there must be a better solution.p

The thing is that the warning is quite annoying. I dont want to ignore it because it may mask more important problems. I also dont want to send additional codepageviewcode hit for each redirect.p  pIs there any elegant way to ignoredismiss this warningp

Negative 79573 pI have faced a problem I would like to compute the intersection of three circles. To the best of my knowledge, I should use the so called a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiTrilateration relnofollowTrilaterationa. I have implemented it in c. The a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiTrilateration relnofollowarticlea says that there are three limitation of this solution.p  ol liall three centers are in the plane z  0, li lithe sphere center, P1, is at the origin,li liand the sphere center, P2, is on the xaxisli ol  pAs for the first criterion, I have nothing to do because all the three centers are in the plane z  0 since I do not use Z coordinates. After that I translated the points to the positions where the center of the first point P1 is at the origin. After that, I rotated the P2 and P3 as well point to the position where the P2 is on the xaxis.p  pMy problem is When all the three center are on the X axis, I tried to compute the center of the intersection areawhich is computed by using the algorithm of the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiTrilateration relnofollowwikis articlea, but the calculation can not be done. On the other hand there is no limitation which says something like the centers of the circles can not be on one line... Lets see my problem visually, I just painted itp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comn7Ykh.png altintersection of three circlesp  pAs you can see, the three circle intersect each other on the same point at coordinates of 4,3. Therefore there is a solution for these points which are all on the same line in this example, on the x axis. The parameters of the circles are the following x,y,radiusp  precodeP1 0,0,5 P2 4,0,3 P3 8,0,5 codepre  pAs I mentioned, I successfully implemented the algorithm of the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiTrilateration relnofollowTrilaterationa but it can not solve this example, the result is NaN Not a Number.

For that I need to add a method signature to the codeIEnumerableSignaturescode interface located in the internal class codeExpressionParsercode. p  precodeinternal class ExpressionParser      interface IEnumerableSignatures              [...]       codepre  pWhile I could add the signature to the code directly, Id rather define this as an extension method to the interface, to keep the original code clean. Usually, to add the method codeDefaultIfEmptycode, I would do something like thisp  precodeinternal static class Extension       static void DefaultIfEmptythis ExpressionParser.IEnumerableSignatures sig  codepre  pThis gives an access error though, because codeExpressionParsercode is internal. I have already tried with several combinations of access level for the class and method.p  pIs there a way to add an extension method to such an interface or do I have to mess with the original codep  pstrong[edit]strong Turns out that, even when making the interface itself internal or public for that matter, it is not recognized by dynamic linq. I still got some notfound exception on runtime. So theres no obvious way around editing the codeplex code. strong[edit]strongp

For example, I have my code as belowp  precodeimport numpy as np import copy from pyspark import SparkConf, SparkContext  class A     def initself, n         self.num  n  class BA      Copy the item of class A to B.     def initself, A         self.num  copy.deepcopyA.num       Print out the item of B     def displayself, s         print s.num         return s  def main      Locally run an application test using Spark.     conf  SparkConf.setAppNametest.setMasterlocal[2]       Setup the Spark configuration.     sc  SparkContextconf  conf       data is a list to store a list of instances of class A.      data  []     for i in np.arange5         x  Ai         data.appendx       lines separate data in Spark.       lines  sc.parallelizedata       Parallelly creates a list of instances of class B using      Spark map.     temp  lines.mapB       Now I got the error when it runs the following code      NameError global name display is not defined.     temp1  temp.mapdisplay  if name  main     main codepre  pIn fact, I used the above code to parallelly generate a list of instances of codeclass Bcode using codetemp  lines.mapBcode. After that, I did codetemp1  temp.mapdisplaycode, as I wanted to parallelly print out each of the items in that list of instances of codeclass Bcode. But now the error shows up codeNameError global name display is not defined.code I am wondering how I can fix the error, if I still use ApacheSpark parallel computing. I really appreciate if anyone helps me. p

Negative 79573 pI am new fairly new to using jwts and to authentication techniques in general so I may be missing out on something. Most authentication examples I have seen jwt or cookie use a dedicated controller for authentication. With session cookies I get why you would want to do this youre actually storing and manipulating data on the server, but is there a reason for doing this with jwts Im writing an app with sails that uses jwts and for now I just have a login method in my user controller that validates login credentials and returns a jwt and it just feels more logical to me. I suppose there could be scenarios where complexity would lead to the need for separation if thats the case Im curious to see what that would look like.p  pAnyways, Im mainly asking this question to make sure Im not making any major mistakes by not separating auth methods from my user controller, but general insight would be nice as well.p
Negative 79573 pI have deals on my site. The thing is, each deal can vary completely. If it was T Shirts and you had variable sizes, you can have an attribute called Size and added fixed values Small, medium, large. However my arrangement, if you had to use this, would involve creating a new attribute with one value each time. I dont see that working practically because its a lot of effort to create new attributes every time you create a product. p  pHere is an example of what the variations can  look likep  precodeProduct 1  3 Beers At jacks Steakhouse , 5USD  gt Variation 1 6 beers, 7USD  gt Variation 2 12 beers, 8 USD Product 2  Hair perm at Sallys Hair Studio, 10USD  gt Variation 1 Hair Perm and Manicure , 11USD  gt Variation 2 Hair Perm, Manicure and Massage, 20 USD codepre  pIn other words, each product will have a main price, but could have two variations that vary on completely arbitrary factors. p  pI want to be able to click Create Product Node and then simply specify each of these variations with an amount. What is the easiest way to do this p

Negative 79573 pI built a small application with 1 controller and 3 services. One of the services uses a webworker. I also made a service to hold the data for all ui elements. My controller and my 2 services have access to the uiservice. The controller calls a service, which then updates the values of the uiservice. But the scope only detects this when the service is finished and is back in the main controller. The service with the webworker needs a deferred element and only gives back a promise. It also has a progress counter in it.  With this progress information I wanted to update the uiservice.progress to display the change. uiservice.progress gets updated, but the scope itself only gets updated after the promise is resolved, but then the progress information is completely useless because it is already 100 .p  precode  angular.moduleApp.controllerAppcontroller, [scope, service1,service2,uiservice, functionscope,service1,service2, uiservice      scope.ui  uiservice      service1.dosomething      now scope.ui sees changes and and updates view      service2.somethingwithwebworker.thenfunctionres         scope.data  res.data                    angular.moduleApp.factoryservice1, [uiservice, functionuiservice      var service        dosomething function            important things         uiservice.active  true         uiservice.message  test          uiservice values are updated, but not view          more important stuff         return service ]    angular.moduleApp.factoryservice2, [q,uiservice, functionq, uiservice          var service            somethingwithwebworker function               var deferred  q.defer                webworker  new Workerjsserviceswebworker.js                 webworker.postMessageinformation                  webworker.onmessage  functione                 ife.data.labels  undefined ampamp e.data.data  undefined                   no data yet, only progress information                      uiservice.progress  e.data.progress                 else                  finished, resolve promise with data                      uiservice.showGraph  true                      uiservice.active  false                      deferred.resolvee.data                                                      return deferred.promise             ] codepre  pI know I could post the progress with the notify function and catch it in the main controller, but then I would have to put a ui change into my controller again, and then my uiservice becomes quite useless.p  pIs there not a way where the scope will change when the uiservice changes, but it is still inside a service and not back in the controller.p  pOr is this whole uiservice already a big design mistakep  pI hope I explained it well enough.p

Negative 79573 pWhat Microsoft Edge is doing, at least from what I can see, is that any external javascriptie javascript from any other FQDN that is different from the websites is being sandboxed to an extent.p  pIm not sure how much it is being sandboxed, but Edge will not let you see function code. So if you were to do a someFunction.toString, you will getp  precodefunction someFunction  [native code]  codepre  pwhere as in any other browser you would get p  precodefunction someFunctionargs, args1  the functions code  codepre  pYou can of course run the function but you cant print it out. Where this gets to be a problem is with Prototype. For subclasses, prototype does a toString of a function to see if it has super as its first argument. If it does, then it knows to link that with a parent classs function. If prototype cant see a text version of the function, any subclasses will not work correctly.p  pThere are no security settings in Edge that can be changed.p  pDoes anyone know any workaround or do we just have to wait and see if Microsoft will fix thisp  pUPDATEp  pI just confirmed that the latest a hrefhttpssupport.microsoft.comenuskb3081438 relnofollowWindows 10 Cumulative Updatea has fixed the issue.

Negative 79573 pI am developing a MMORPG using C and Monogame. Right now, I am working on developing the network protocol for it. I should note that I am a CCNA so I do have a pretty solid understanding on how both protocols work. However, I only have programmed single player games in the past. However I am a little stuck in trying to figure out which protocol I should use. I initially started my implementation using UDP, and have successfully sent single packets over my local network, but am worried that UDP may falter once I start adding more and more clients. Considering this is a connection for gaming, I initially came to the conclusion that I needed a connection that is fast, with low latency. But soon realized that some of the Packets I need to send can start to measure many KB in size, such as when a client enters a new area on the map, or a client trying to connect needs to update its local texture cache.p  pMy question goes out to those who are experienced in making multiplayer games Even with TCPs larger overhead, is it worth using it, or adjusting your games protocol for reliability over UDPp

Negative 79573 pI have the set of data below. It has a few rows of unwanted characters before the numbers I want to read in, as well as a few unwanted rows after the data. I created a substring that will serve as my first column, which is purely numerical. There is data, when the set is read in, above and below these numericals that were converted to NA. Is there a way, other than skip and nrow, that I can remove the NA rows and read in only those rows that are numericalp  precodexltread.csv...,    headerFALSE, na.stringsY  yltsubstrxV1,1,8 yltas.numericy  x2ltcbindy,x1 x2ltas.data.framex2 codepre  pI have triedp  precodeif xy  is.numeric      printx  else      print codepre  pBut that is clearly wrong as all I get are errors.

Rather than actually deleting the rows, we were just temporarily removing them. Is there a way to permanently remove them so that my columns will be class numericp

Negative 79573 pProblem When i hover the mouse on the div block, the ul list items are displayed with a fadein, and when i distract the mouse from the div block, the ul list items are fadeing out, and when i do the same action fast 5,6,7 or more times and when i do nothing with the mouse, the functions mouseenter and mouseleave are repeating because of the fadeing duration. I want that for example if the function mouseenter has started, the other function mouseleave would not start even if the user has the mouse distracted from the div block, the mouseleave function must wait until the mouseenter function has finished his job, and then the mouseleave function can start, and so on..

Negative 79573 pI am having a bit of trouble with some work with text files and the associated metadata for the files.

Herein is where my problem begins I have a csv with the metadata for the texts their file names, titles, authors, years, genres, etc. which I would like to have associated with each vector of tokens, in order to easily model my information over time, by gender, etc. p  pI am unsure of how to do this, but am guessing it would need to be done as the files are being read, and not merged after I have manipulated the document texts.
