Positive 6159 pI have been doing an implementation of Conways game of life in PySide a hrefhttpgithub.comJavieracostgameoflife relnofollow[source]a. So far it works good until a point in which, under certain conditions I havent figured out yet, the QGraphicsView i use to display the grid which consists of several QGraphicsRectItems on a QGraphicsScene suddenly stops being painted continuously. The rest of the window remains responsive and the game thread keeps running and signaling for the ui to update the current generation number. It is only when the window gains focus that the graphicsView updates for about a second and then freezes again.p  pI find this behavior particularly strange given that i dont override paintEvent, nor call repaintupdate methods at all, but what the game thread does is to update every RectItems brush color according to the status it should have every generation.p  pAny ideas on what could be causing thisp  pbtw this is on Kubuntu 14.04.3  KWin 4.11.11  Qt 4.8.6p

Positive 6159 pI routinely use PyDev in Eclipse for Python development.  However, Im trying PyQt for the first time in the same environment.  It works well, with one exception.  If the program errors out anywhere within the Qt main event loop, including within my own code, no error information is output to the PyDev console.p  pTo demonstrate this I created the following simple PyQt appp  precodeimport sys from PyQt5 import uic from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication   test.ui contains a single Push Button named pushButton base, form  uic.loadUiType..uitest.ui   class MainWindowbase, form     def initself, parentNone         superbase, self.initparent         self.setupUiself         self.pushButton.clicked.connectself.buttonpressed      def buttonpressedself         printbutton pressed         printinvalidvariable  intentional error         pass  if name  main     app  QApplicationsys.argv     app.setStylefusion     mainwindow  MainWindow     mainwindow.show     sys.exitapp.exec codepre  pIf I place an intentional error such as codeprintinvalidvariablecode anywhere after codeif name  maincode and before the codeapp.execcode command, the program properly terminates with a traceback and the expected codeNameError name invalidvariable is not definedcode.  However, if I press the button in my dialog using the above code, codebutton pressedcode appears on the console but then the application terminates silently and with no error information in the console.  Other debugging operations, such as breakpoints and expressions, work fine.p  pIs this expected behavior  If so, what do you recommend for facilitating debugging of PyQt apps in this environment.  If not, Id appreciate insight into what I need to do to rectify the problem.p  ul liPython version python3.4.3.amd64 li liPyDev version PyDev for Eclipse 4.3.0.201508182223 li liPyQt version PyQt55.5gplPy3.4Qt5.5.0x64li ul  hr  pUpdate strong20150930strongp  pWhen I run the test app directly with python.exe, it outputs the error correctly to strongstderrstrong in both error scenarios.

I additionally created an entirely fresh Eclipse workspace with only the Python interpreter configured and ran my test again on a freshly created PyDev project using the same source code.

I have found it quite useful myself, in doing so I tackle projects much faster, and my overall design tends to be better.p  pIve noticed a basic redundancy issue when it comes to writing code. In Visio you can be very descriptive in your Models. Your basic outlines for your classes can include C variable typesmethods. They are detailed enough that Visio has you choose whether it is C or VB.p  pMy Question is, with this much detail, does there exist an importing technique between Visio and Visual Studio 2008 It seems like you could import that simple model as an outline for classes in Visual Studio, with everything declared except for the actual code within Methods. This would be very useful, especially when it comes to design steps for creating a program. My classesvariablesmethods would already be declared for me. I would just have to go back and write the meat of the code.p  pIve done some searching on the subject and havent turned up much, it seems like Microsoft would have included a feature to do this.p

Negative 6159 pstrongShortstrongbrIs there a way to have a routedefinition that will pass the CONTROLLERACTION string value to a JavaScript function in stead of actually going straight for the controller actionp  pstrongMorestrongbrI have a masterpage which contains the navigation of the site. Now, all the pages need this navigation wrapped around it at all times, but because I didnt want the navigation to constantly load with each pagecall, I changed all my pages to partialviews. These partial views are loaded via the JQuery.Load method whenever a menu item is clicked in the navigation.p  pThis all worked very good, up till now because I noticed its also a requirement of the website to be able to link directly to page X, rather then default.aspx.p  pstrongSo, as an examplestrongbrThe main page is my default.aspx page, this utilizes my master page with the navigation around it. And each call to a new page uses a javascript function that loads that particular partial view inside a div that is known in my masterpage. So, the url never changes away from default.aspx, but my content changes seemlesly.p  pThe problem is, those urls also need to be available when typed directly into the address bar. But, theyre partial views, so loading them directly from the address bar makes them display without any masterpages around them.  Therefore my question if it might be possible to capture the route typed into the address bar and pass that on to my JavaScript function that will load that route in the content div.p  pI hope I explained it ok enough, if not, feel free to ask more informationp

Negative 6159 pI have created two classes to externally control page number codePagecode and ordering codeOrdercode on a repository. The repository exposes codeIEnumerableltTgtcode and not codeIQueryableltTgtcode since I want the repository to have strong testability.p  pSay, for example, if I had the following repositoryp  precodeinterface IUserRepository      public IEnumerableltUsergt GetAll  codepre  pIf I want the emcallerem to control the subset of the response, they would need to pass in the pageorder. So first thought would be to add overloadsp  precodeinterface IUserRepository      IEnumerableltUsergt GetAll     IEnumerableltUsergt GetAllOrderedAndPagedOrder order, Page page  codepre  pThe problem I find with this is that I have to create multiple overloads which I find to be pretty tedious.p  pWhat Im thinking but not sure of doing is having codeOrdercode and codePagecode be optional parametersp  precodeinterface IUserRepository      IEnumerableltUsergt GetAllOrder order  null, Page page  null  codepre  pThis way the calling code can easily sortpage, but not play with the emmain queryem which is what Im trying to avoid by exposing codeIEnumerableltTgtcode instead of codeIQueryableltTgtcode.p  pDoes this seem like a good or bad design I know that could be considered a bit subjective, but Im trying to see if there is functionally wrong with this. The main key is that my repositories are testable and the caller cant play aroundchange the query too much. I figured that since sortingordering are a emveryem common task for a returning set of data, why not incorporate them into the design of the repository interface. Again, when testing, I only care that the emrightem set of data is returned, but the caller can say Now, give me this pageordered subset of the data.p

Negative 6159 pA little background on the query below. Cell has a 1M to Container and a 1M with Printer.

Here is the query I havep  precodevar query  from cell in Cell     join container in Container.Where row gt row.SerialNumber  1102141 on cell.CellID equals container.CellID     into containers      join printer in Printer.Where row gt row.Name  PG10RelWarrPrt3 on cell.CellID equals printer.CellID     into printers      select new  Cell  cell, Containers  containers, Printers  printers   query.Dump codepre  pThis query works, but is not efficient. It does a left outer join on Container, but, for each Cell, it performs a separate query to retrieve any Printer rows, instead of also doing a left outer join on Printer.p  pHow can I change this so that it also does a left outer join on the Printer table BTW, I want a hierarchical result set. IOW, each Cell should have a list of containers and a list of printers. Each would be empty of course, if none existed for the cell.p

Negative 6159 pFor few years I was looking for way to manage multiple projects Im working on. Every single one is different in some way, but the core of application in common for all. When I implemented some new features in current project, it was hard to use them in later in other  project. I had to search through many projects to actually find the feature.p  pThen came git and it helped a lot to improve my projects management. I created one skeleton project, where the whole application structure and core libraries, tools and modules are implemented. Its a base for  each new project Im starting. It looks like thisp  precodemkdir newproject cd newproject git init codepre  pTime for skeleton to mergep  precodegit remote add skeleton gitdomainskeleton.git git fetch skeleton git merge skeletonmaster codepre  pNow here comes project tweaking, changing ini files, adding custom templates, modules, presenters and so on. Now project lives its own life. After some time comes merging with updated skeletonp  precodegit fetch skeleton git merge skeletonmaster nocommit codepre  pI like to review all changes coming from skeleton to project, therefore nocommit option. p  pAnd now my question comes. strongWhat is the best way to maintain skeleton strong When adding new features to each project that uses skeleton as a base, there are features, that are only related to current project.  But there are features to the core of application and I will need them in my next project as well, therefore I need to merge them to skeleton back. p  pI didnt find any way in gitmerge or any other gits command to maintain skeleton. So Im manually comparing project with skeleton using meld, great tool though and applying changes that are meant for skeleton, then Im committing to skeleton.p  pI tried to maintain skeleton to add project as remote, fetch project and then merge to skeleton, but this way all the changes to project, that are for project only are coming back to skeleton and that is invalid.p

Negative 6159 pIve was studying hash based sort and i found that using prime numbers in a hash function is considered a good idea because  multiplying each character of the key by a prime number and adding the results up would produce a unique value because primes are unique and a prime number like 31 would produce better distribution of keys..p  pi would like to understand why the use of even numbers for multiplying each character is a bad idea in the context of this explanation below  found in another forum, it sounds like a good explanation but im failing to grasp it.

Negative 6159 pI just rewrote my game to use core animation in an effort to make it faster. I have a UIView with a layer that contains many sublayers the game tiles.

Negative 6159 pi am using the a hrefhttpthree20.info relnofollowthree20a codeTTTableViewControllercode for my current project. For switching between views, i use codeUITabBarcode. A few of my views have subviews  i dont use codeTTNavigatorcode for switching between those views, but my own logic simple pushpop viewControllers.p  pSomehow, i am not able to set the colorstyle of my codeUINavigationBarcode in those subviews initially, it works for my mainviews that are controlled by the codetabbarcontrollercode.p  pMy setup looks like thisp  pIn my codeAppDelegatecode i prepare the coderootViewControllercode and the codenavigationControllercodep  precodeRootViewController rootController  [[[RootViewController alloc] init] autorelease] navigationController  [[UINavigationController alloc]    initWithRootViewControllerrootController] navigationController.navigationBar.barStyle  UIBarStyleBlack               window  [[PSWindow alloc] initWithFrame[[UIScreen mainScreen] bounds]] window.rootViewController  navigationController  codepre  pHere i set codeUIBarStyleBlackcode as my default style.

This works. However, the codenavigationBarcode colorstyle is now the default one, and not black, as i set it in my codeAppDelegatecode. I have checked the object addresses in the debugger and it is the same codenavigationControllercode  codenavigationBarcode as the one in my coderootViewControllercode.p  pWhen I explicitly set the codenavigationBarcode colorstyle in the targets initializer function, the settings are ignored.p  pAdditionally, when i now hit the backbutton in the navigationbar, the barstylecolor in my codemainViewscode is also incorrect from black to default.p  pAny ideas how I could debugfix thisp

Negative 6159 pI need to migrate a fairly large forum installation from one system custom, MS SQLServer to another vbulletin, MySQL.

The new system uses MySQL the schemas are not similar ul liCan PHP talk to SQLServer If not, perhaps use Java to do the migration since it can talk to both the new system is written in php, and wed like to keep all code in one language if possibleli ulli liThe amount of data is on the order of 13 million posts and 650k members ul liIf necessary, we can prune members removing those that havent logged in in the last X years and dont have posts in active threadsli liIf necessary, we can prune threads removing those that havent had new posts in the last X yearsli liEven after pruning, were still likely to have on the order of 7.5 million postsli ulli ul  pThe things things that I think might cause problems includep  ul liIm not sure if I can keep ids message or user from the old system in the new. li liI obviously cant load all 13m records into memory from the old database, process them, and then write to the new databaseli liI want to be able to run a second data migration later to get any new data since the original import so we can run a long running import against a backup of the main database, then run an everything else import when its time to switch off the old systemli ul  pMy current thought is to do something likep  ul liAdd an codeolduseridcode column to the new database user tableli liMigrate the users from the old database, putting their original user id in the new columnli liLoad threads from the old database in batches of X, and insert them into the new database, using the codeolduserid  newuseridcode mapping in the user tableli liWhen migrating users, load them in order of creation date and keep track of the most recent date in another db table. This will allow the system to pick up where it left off the next time we run itli liSame thing applies to threadsli liWhen running a migration, first get for everything created before the stored date, but modified after it and update the records in the database with the modified information. Once that is done, handle the things created since thenli ul  pMy apologies for such an open ended question. Theres a lot of factors involved, and it really isnt something I have specific questions on yet. Im really just looking for any thoughtssuggestions from folks that may have had to handle something similar in the past. Any ideas on the best way to handle things, things Im missing, or edge cases I should pay attention to.p  pEdit I cant figure out how to make this a wiki.

Negative 6159 pIm working on converting a website. It involved standardizing the directory structure of images and media files. Im parsing path information from various tags, standardizing them, checking to see if the media exists in the new standardized location, and putting it there if it doesnt. Im using string manipulation to do so.p  pThis is a little openended, but is there a class, tool, or concept out there I can use to save myself some headaches For instance, Im running into problems where, say, a page in a sudirectory codewebsite.comsubdirdirpage.phpcode has relative image paths code..imagesimage.pngcode, or other kinds of things like this. Its not like theres one overarching problem, but just a lot of little things that add up. p  pWhen I think Ive got my script covering most cases, then I get errors like codeCould not find file at exportstandardizedfolderproperimagefolderimage.pngcode where it should be codeexportstandardizedfolderproperimagefolderimage.pngcode. Its kind of driving me mad, doing string parsing and checks to make sure that directory separators are in the proper places. p  pI feel like Im putting too much work into making a oneoff import script very robust. Perhaps someones already untangled this mess in a reuseable way, one which I can take advantage ofp  pstrongPost Scriptstrong So heres a more indepth scoop. I write my script that parses one type of page and pulls content from the same of its kind. Then I turn my script to parse another type of page, get all knids of errors, and learn that all my assumptions about how paths are referenced must be thrown out the window. Wash, rinse, repeat. p  pSo Im looking at doing some major refactoring of my script, throwing out all assumptions, and checking, rechecking, and doublechecking path information. Since Im really trying to build a robust path building script, hopefully I can avoid reinventing the wheel. Is there a wheel out therep

If I generate many ItemInfos by refreshing my view, for example, I reach GREF limit soon described a hrefhttpandroid.xamarin.comDocumentationTroubleshoot relnofollowherea, Unexpected NullReferenceExceptions section, and my application crashes. Looking into Android log, I can see thousands of Android.Runtime.IJavaObject objects, which overflow GREF limit. p  pAccording to a hrefhttpandroid.xamarin.comDocumentationArchitecture relnofollowconceptsa of Mono VM  Dalvik VM bridge I can understand, that my ItemInfos need to be passed to Dalvik VM, wrapped to IJavaObject and to be formatted in ListView by native environment  this creates GREFs. As long as garbage collecting is a nondetermined process, if I call FillList many times, old, already used ItemInfos stay into memory, leaking.p  pHow can I avoid leaking Or, possible, is there another way to output large portions of formatted data into ListView I triedp  ul liI cant reduce the number of ItemInfos, as long as I need to place my data somehow.li liI cant follow this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7443818monodroidgrefproblembestpractice74447237444723advicea, as long as my ItemInfo is not an IJavaObject.li liAs a temporarily solution, I call GC.Collect every time I need to refresh list, but this looks not a clean way.

Negative 6159 pSo this one is infuriating me, because it works in some view controllers, but not in others. I have a particular view controller that has a custom init method, which starts out by calling the standard codeinitWithNibNamecode method to initialize the view. However, for the life of me I cannot get that method to be called. Im using code identical to other view controllers that have custom init methods and work fine, but some just refuse to call the method. The code I have for the controller that doesnt work isp  precode idinitWithNibNameNSString nibNameOrNil bundleNSBundle nibBundleOrNil      self  [super initWithNibNamenibNameOrNil bundlenibBundleOrNil]     if self           Custom initialization          return self  codepre  pAnd the custom init method isp  precode idinitWithUserTPUser selectedUser andFilterModeintmode      self  [super initWithNibNameRecommendationsView bundlenil]     if self          [self.tabBarItem setFinishedSelectedImage[UIImage imageNamedtabIconstreamselected.png] withFinishedUnselectedImage[UIImage imageNamedtabIconstream.png]]         [self.tableView setSeparatorColor[UIColor colorWithRed255.0255.0 green255.0255.0 blue255.0255.0 alpha0.15]]          user  selectedUser         filterMode  mode          if selectedUser  nil              self.title  [NSString stringWithFormat , user.firstName, user.lastName]          else              self.title  Stream                   return self  codepre  pThe code inside of the custom init method is called between the check for codeselfcode, but that first line that calls code[super initWithNibName...code never calls the method. I can verify that by placing an codeNSLogcode inside of the method and it never gets logged.p  pAs I said, this is driving me crazy because many other view controllers in my project use a custom init method, which calls codeinitWithNibNamecode in the exact same way, and they all work fine. But a couple of them, including this example one, do not. And yes, Ive verified all the simple stuff the nib name is correct, etc...p

Here a few items from the list to demonstratep  blockquote   pabroad aatn request 1p      pabroad aatn silence 1p      pabroad aatn time 6p      pabroad abecause ofn schedule 1p      pabroad abyn american 1p      pabroad abyn bank 1p      pabroad abyn blow 1p blockquote  pSo, my problem arises in the 4th line above.  Obviously I could manually delete the space to solve the problem, but the list is thousands of lines.  Also, I could write code that replaced any occurrences of because of with becauseof, but that is not the only two word sequence that occurs.  In addition, the third slice sometimes contains because of and I want to preserve the whitespace there.  My current code, which is attempting to return the frequency of each sequence, looks like thisp  precodeimport sys import pprint  occlist  [] observed    lines  sys.stdin.readlines  for line in lines     l  line.strip     i  l.split      word  i[0]     rel  i[1]     wirts  i[21]     wirt   .joinwirts   Wordinrelationto which may be compund     occ  i[1]              Frequency of specific word, rel, wirt     arb  word, rel, wirt     occlist.appendintocc      if not arb in observed.keys             observed[arb]  []     if not occ in observed[arb]             observed[arb].appendintoccfloat1064542  pprint.pprintobserved codepre  pThis works except for the aforementioned lines with the extra whitespace.p  pI would appreciate any advice.

Negative 6159 pI am developing a complex library in C and i plan on having a C interface so others can load up the DLL and easily access the lib. I havent tried writing code in C that access C code. I did a quick google and found code that uses a lot of attributes.p  pWhat can I do to keep my interface simple enough to not cause a headache trying to keep .NET in sync with it Is there some kind of header generation tool i may use Do i only use simple POD structs Im unsure how i should handle types as they are passed around as pointers. I am also thinking maybe i should avoid using anything that is a not an intstring or array.p  pI am developing it using MSVC but mostly using it with GCC. I know i should use the calling convention stdcall. Beyond what i said i am totally clueless. I actually dont know how to load the DLL into .NET.p  pWhat can i do to ensure everything works correctly when writing my C lib and getting it to run with .NETp
Negative 6159 pI am trying to return all MSFT Lync Users who have used voice conferencing and the number of times they used it.

Negative 6159 pIm using a GigE ethernet prosilica GC camera on Mac OS X, and have been able to read it out through the proprietary sample viewing software from Allied Vision.p  pI would like to be able to read out the camera using OpenCV.  I have opencv installed correctly, but I am not sure how to read out the camera.  The last person to ask this question 2 years ago was told to use the native camera API to do this, and then analyze the images with opencvp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3345467opencvwithgigevisioncamerasOpenCV with GigE Vision Camerasap  pHowever, I would like to know if it is even possible to do this with python opencv.

Negative 6159 pIm following a course in agile practices and I have a homework. During the course, Ive been taught on how to use FIT for automated acceptance tests. From what I can see, FIT seems to be dying and Im no longer sure that it is the technology I want to use for my homework. Anyway...p  pI have legacy system to test and everything is badly designedcoded. Of course there are no tests, and Im not allowed to refactor or change functionality before writing any acceptance test.p  pFor the sake of simplicity, lets say the system is a shop receipt system that prints the products list with prices and the total cost to the standard output stream. Something like thisp  precodepublic class ReceiptSystem      ListltProductgt boughtProducts  new ArrayListltProductgt      public void buyProductProduct p              boughtProducts.addp           public void printReceipt              ListltReceiptLinegt receipt  new ArrayListltReceiptLinegt         int total  0         int price         forListltProductgt boughtProducts  boughtProduct                      price  SomeThirdPartyClass.calculatePriceboughtProduct.getBarcode             System.out.printlnboughtProduct     price             total  price                   System.out.printlnTOTAL   total       codepre  pThe problem is that the prices are calculated by a third party system with an external library, so I dont know them and I find it difficult if not impossible to write the acceptance test using FIT. In a normal case I would do something likep  pShopping list inputp  precode   products barcode     111111111             123456789             987654321             999999999            codepre  pReceipt expected outputp  precode   receipt              111111111 1.99      123456789 2.99      987654321 3.99      999999999 4.99      TOTAL 13.96        codepre  pBut how can I achieve this without knowing the prices Whats the best strategy to adopt Is there any other framework to achieve thisp  pThank you.p  pstrongUpdatestrong The codeSomeThirdPartyClasscode is codefinalcode, trying to mock it or to write a Proxy class for it will give the following errorp  blockquote   pCannot subclass final class class SomeThirdPartyClassp blockquote  pFurthermore, its immutable and the public constructor has no arguments.

Negative 6159 pIs it possible to use Entity Framework 4.3 without linking the model to an actual DB in the backend  p  pI need to build a conceptual model of a database in the VS designer and then Id like to manually handle fetches, inserts and updates to various backend databases horrible legacy systems.  I need to be able to do this without EF moaning about not having tables mapped, etc.  I realise that this is a very odd thing to want to do...p  pThe reason for this is that we would like to move from these legacy systems into a well designed data model and .NET environment, but we need to still maintain functionality and backward compatibility with the old systems during development. We will then reach a stage where we can import the old data coming from about 6 different databases into a single DB that matches the EF model Im building. In theory, we should then be able to switch over from the hacked up EF model to a proper EF model matching the new data structure.p  pIs this viable Is it possible to use the EF interface, with LINQ without actually pointing it to a databasep  pI have managed to query the legacy systems by overriding the generated DbContext and exposing IQueryable properties which query the old systems. My big fight now is with actually updating the data.p  pIf I am able to have EF track changes to entities, but not actually save those changes. I should be able to override the SaveChanges method on the context to manually insert into various legacy tables.p  pIm sort of at wits end with this issue at the moment.p  pUDPATE 4 Sept 2012 Ive opted to use the EDMX file designer to build the data model and I generate the code by using T4. This enables me to then manually write mapping code to suit my needs. It also allows me to later perform a legacy data migration with relative ease.p

Negative 6159 pFirstly I am no longer a student and doing this for other purposes, so dont hold back on the help p  pI want to incorporate a simple program into my webpage. I want 4 buttons labelled right arm, left arm, activate voice and walk forward. There will be a box above these buttons showing an image of a robot and as the buttons are pressed by the user I want a different image to be loaded in the box. p  pSo if the right arm button is pressed the image with the robot raising its right arm will need to be displayed.p  pSo basically all I want the buttons to do is to load the image that belongs to each one.

Negative 6159 pI have a number of views that include tableviews, but other controls as well.  Up till now I have been subclassing UIViewController and manually adding a tableview to it with my other controls abovebelow it.  Not too much hassle, other than having to manually handle the scrolling, and sometimes some resizing if the tables content is dynamic.p  pI only just found that the tableHeaderView and tableFooterView of a UITableView can pretty much handle anything you throw at them.  I guess I skimmed them previously, thinking they were related to section headersfooters when they are of course not related at all.p  pSo with that in mind, and before I convert a bunch of classes over to subclass UITableViewController instead of UIViewController, is this standard practice  If I have a view, for example, that is mostly nontable content but with a dynamic tableview half way down, is it a good idea simply to use a UITableViewController and put everything around it in the headerfooterp

Negative 6159 pI am creating a mobile game that takes words from users and then validates them to see if they are valid words in the English dictionary. I have created a similar game like this in the past using a dictionary that I loaded into the games local memory.p  pThe problem with that approach was that I would often need to update the dictionary with new words. Since the dictionary was in memory, adding new words required me to completely update the app. If I were to use an SQL database as the dictionary, I could add words very easily without having to update the app and have to rely on users to go and download the new update.p  pMy question is, is there any thing wrong with this approach design or performance wise I have not seen something like this being done before. Also, I dont need definitions. I just need to make sure that the word is a valid English word.p  pIf this is bad design, are there any better alternatives Or am I better off just dealing with the in memory dictionaryp

Negative 6159 pI have created a program that subscribes to WPFs touch events. Everything has been working as expected over the last few months, but yesterday none of the touch events would fire. I tried creating a new, simple program to test touch events, but it works the same, all of the touch input gets sent as mouse events, even though the cursor changes from the mouse arrow to the touch crosshairs.p  pI restarted the computer several times and reinstalled the drivers but it did not seem to change anything. I have tried using a different brand of touch screen with different drives which also used to work and am seeing the exact same issue. Using the touch screens built in test tool, I can see that touch and multitouch are working as I expect and viewing the  Pen and Touch section of the System Properties confirms that the computer is recognizing the touch screen. p  pEDIT I continued to test the monitor and it appears that multitouch is working in other windows programs like paint. The touch appears to not work only in my applications.p  pHas anyone else experienced this or have any idea how to reenable the touch eventsp

Negative 6159 pBasically I need your advice my good stack friends Dp  pFor the last six months I am exploringlearningdeveloping iOS apps with a hrefhttpwww.appcelerator.comTitanium Appceleratora mobile framework. My experiences are mostly good or very good.p  pstrongSome negative partsstrong of Titanium would be building time, especially when testing on a device. When using only Xcode native, your app starts immediately on a device, while with Titanium you have to wait for a while 12 minutes for your app to build and then to install it on a device iTunes or iPhone Configuration Utility. p  pBasically everything that you can do natively you can do with Javascript  Titanium. If Titanium does not support some part of iOS framework, you can build a native ObjectiveC module and have those features in your Javascript code.p  pI feel really comfortable now using Titanium Appcelerator and building apps with Javascript. Also I learned some ObjectiveC while building a few modules for iOS. Eg. a hrefhttpsgithub.comDino4674MovementDeviceMotiona which I used in my first iOS app a hrefhttpitunes.apple.comusappid517057897Spellerya.p  pstrongNow the questionstrongp  pMost companies wants only native developers and are sceptic of Titanium. Titanium is different from other cross platform SDKs Eg. PhoneGap because here you actually use native components buttons, labels etc and your app is not running in a WebView. But if company wants native then you cant force them to use Titanium.p  pSince I would like to develop mobile apps as a job, should I just throw my last six months of intensive exploring of Titanium and learn programming those apps nativelyp  pWhat are your thoughts on this because I see no point in learningperfecting both of themp  pI am a very big fan of Appcelerator Titanium now so this is a very heavy decision to make.p

Negative 6159 pI am wondering if there is a better way to iterate two items at a time in a list. I work with Maya a lot, and one of its commands listConnections returns a list of alternating values. The list will look like [connectionDestination, connectionSource, connectionDestination, connectionSource]. To do anything with this list, I would ideally like to do something similar top  precodefor destination, source in cmds.listConnections     print source, destination codepre  pYou could, of course just iterate every other item in the list using [2] and enumerate and source would be the index1, but then you have to add in extra checks for odd numbered lists and stuff.p  pThe closest thing I have come up with so far isp  precodefrom itertools import izip connections  cmds.listConnections for destination, source in izipconnections[2], connections[12]     print source, destination codepre  pThis isnt super important, as I already have ways of doing what I want. This just seems like one of those things that there should be a better way of doing it.p

Negative 6159 pIn the embedded world we often have data structures that are passed around via fixedlength buffers.  These are relatively easy to handle using something like thisp  precodedefine TOTALBUFFERLENGTH 4096 struct overlay      uint16t field1     uint16t field2     uint8t  array1[ARY1LEN]  staticassertsizeofstruct overlay lt TOTALBUFFERLENGTH  struct overlay overlay  mallocTOTALBUFFERLENGTH codepre  pThat is, we use a data structure as an overlay to allow easy access to the part of the buffer that is currently being used.p  pWe have a number of buffer formats, however, that also use the emlastem few bytes of the buffer to store things like checksums.  We currently use constructions like thisp  precodestruct overlay      uint16t field1     uint16t field2     uint8t  array1[ARY1LEN]     char     reserved[TOTALBUFFERLENGTH                        sizeofuint16t  sizeofuint16t                        sizeofuint8t  ARY1LEN                        sizeofuint32t]     uint32t crc  codepre  pAs ugly as this looks for this simple data structure, its an absolute monstrosity when the structure grows to have dozens of fields.  Its also a maintainability nightmare, as adding or removing a structure field means that the size calculation for codereservedcode must be updated at the same time.p  pWhen the end of the structure only contains one item like a checksum, then we sometimes use a helper function for readingwriting the value.  That keeps the data structure clean and maintainable, but it doesnt scale well when the end of the buffer has multiple fields.p  pIt would help greatly if we could do something like this insteadp  precodestruct overlay      uint16t field1     uint16t field2     uint8t  array1[ARY1LEN]     char     reserved[TOTALBUFFERLENGTH                        offsetofstruct overlay, reserved                        sizeofuint32t]     uint32t crc  codepre  pUnfortunately, codeoffsetofcode only works on complete object types and since this is in the middle of the definition of codestruct overlaycode, that type isnt yet complete.p  pIs there a cleaner, more maintainable way to do this sort of thing  I essentially need a fixedlength structure with fields at the beginning and at the end, with the remaining space in the middle reservedunused.p

All images will have each image sizes so there is no redundancy in the future for some images not having certain sizes.

Negative 6159 pwhat I need is someone to see why CakePHP Ver 2.2.2 is doing what it is doing OK the breakdown of my code is as follows. The DIV PageList is a JQuery Accordion, with two drop downs, one for an admin to add a new use and the other to view all users and make some changes. Add user is fine and works without any problems. p  pMy problem is or at lest i think it is withe the Form Helper, I did have the Form Create call outside my foreach loop before and was working without any problems, I would find the user I wanted to change something on and then save, no problem. When I stated to pageinate the results I started to get problems. As when the Form Create was outside the foreach and just before the start of my table code, only the last results displayed would be able to save the changes made. I found the cause of the problem and that was the ID field was always defaulting to last displayed result. so I moved the Form Create to within my foreach loop. p  pThis now works but for some reason, it starts the ends right away, therefore my inputs are now seating outside the form tags I dont understand why because I have the end Form Helper end call at the bottom of the foreach loop. Therefore it should just display each user in its own form. p  pI am not sure if this is a issue and can still use it like this. But the one issue is that my form now starts after my table, which will not validate with W3C, this is not a big issue. Side note, is it ok to use tables still I am listing data with them I am trying to learn the HTML 5 spec. but have not really seen anything about tables let...p  pMany Thanks.

Negative 6159 pI have a page containing a large amount of controls that can trigger postbacks to the server.  I know that it is not considered good practice to have a huge amount controls on one page, but the nature of my ASP.NET web application requires it.  Seeing that I have a large amount of controls on this page, I make extensive use of UpdatePanels.  I am storing ViewState in Session in order to reduce the response size of the page, which works beautifully.p  pHowever, with Fiddler I noticed that the asyncPostBackControlIDs after the VIEWSTATE part of the ajax response contains a list of every control of every UpdatePanel that can trigger a postback.  This list is huge  It seems that this list doesnt change much per page, and thus it doesnt make sense to download the entire list every time a postback within an UpdatePanel occurs...p  pIs there any way to store the asyncPostBackControlIDs on server like you can do with ViewState, or otherwise reduce the size of the asyncPostBackControlIDs listp

Negative 6159 pHi I am profiling with VTUNE an intel visual studio extension my 2D numerical model I wrote for my research, in order to speed it up a little. I already sped up my 1D model this way i.e. identifying the hotspot of my model. This time though, after running the profiler I see that the most time consuming part is not a fortran subroutine I wrote as it occured for my 1D model but it is a dll called Acxtrnal.dll. I googled the name of this dll but I could not find better information. Does anybody know why this dll is taking so much and what it is needed for thanks A.p  pEDIT So I was able to add download the symbols for the DLL from Microsoft website so now when debugging it shows that the CPU time is lost here.

Im also not clear how dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifierCellIdentifier works. If I Throw an NSLog in the middle of this, it gets called every time I scroll up and down, which leads me to believe I creating a new instance of AVPlayer as well, and this seams like a giant memory leak. Basically, how to I do this correctly, allocate a class like a AVPlayer for use in a UITableviewCell, but make sure that I dont reallocate it the next time cellForRowAtIndexPath is called.p

Negative 6159 pIve got a web app which heavily uses AngularJS  AJAX and Id like it to be crawlable by Google and other search engines. My understanding is that I need to do something special to make it work, as described here a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comwebmastersajaxcrawling relnofollowhttpsdevelopers.google.comwebmastersajaxcrawlingap  pUnfortunately, that looks quite nasty and Id rather not introduce the hash tags. What Id like to do is to serve a static page to Googlebot based on the UserAgent, either directly or by sending it a 302 redirect. That way, the web app can be the same, and the whole Googlebot workaround is nicely isolated until it is no longer necessary.p  pMy worry is that Google may mistakenly assume that Im trying to trick Googlebot, while my goal is to help it. What do you guys think about this approach, and what would you recommendp

Negative 6159 pI am depending on some code that uses the Decimal class because it needs precision to a certain number of decimal places. Some of the functions allow inputs to be floats because of the way that it interfaces with other parts of the codebase. To convert them to decimal objects, it uses things likep  precodemydec  decimal.Decimalstrx codepre  pwhere x is the float taken as input. My question is, does anyone know what the standard is for  the str method as applied to floats p  pFor example, take the number 2.1234512. It is stored internally as 2.12345119999999999 because of how floats are represented.p  precodegtgtgt x  2.12345119999999999 gtgtgt x 2.1234511999999999 gtgtgt strx 2.1234512 codepre  pOk, strx in this case is doing something like .6f  x. This is a problem with the way my code converts to decimals. Take the followingp  precodegtgtgt d  decimal.Decimal2.12345119999999999 gtgtgt ds  decimal.Decimalstr2.12345119999999999 gtgtgt d  ds Decimal1E17 codepre  pSo if I have the float, 2.12345119999999999, and I want to pass it to Decimal, converting it to a string using str gets me the wrong answer. I need to know what are the rules for strx that determine what the formatting will be, because I need to determine whether this code needs to be rewritten to avoid this error note that it might be OK, because, for example, the code might round to the 10th decimal place once we have a decimal objectp  pThere must be some set of rules in pythons docs that hopefully someone here can point me to. Thanksp

Negative 6159 pI wanted to run this by you folks and see if anybody here has had a similar experience.p  pWeve had a few apps on the App Store available for the past several months with Crashlytics used as crash reporting service. Over those months we managed to accumulate something like 60 different types of crashes across about 50k users.p  pSome of the crashes are obvious bugs that hit a good chunk of the user base and we fix them right away. Some on the other hand occurred anywhere between 1 and 5 times over the last few months across all of those users.p  ul liObviously from a business perspective it makes no sense to fix those onceinabluemoon bugs, but Id still like to understand if theres a well known type of issues out there that affects every iOS app that one simply cannot defend against. For example, a user pressing the home button at a very inconvenient point in time, perhaps during some kind of transition. Or perhaps, the app being evicted from memory causing a crash to be reported, etc. etc.li ul  pI couldnt quite find a common thread among the crash reports, although I did find a few along the lines ofp  precode[UIGestureRecognizer shouldBegin] [UIApplication sendActiontofromforEvent] objcmsgSend codepre  ul liWhat do you do about bugs like these Keep an eye on them, but dont spend time chasing them down unless they become more severeli ul

Negative 6159 pI was reading about the HTTP protocol   the request  response and how it works. there are two things that Im still not sure I undersand and would love to get some explanations first, is why the HTTP protocol was designed as requestresponse what are the benefits of it or were there other options and the second is how does this protocol affects the security of web applications I know that https is more secure because it is using encryption..but does it mean that http is not secure at all even if Im using POST and not GET etc..p  pthanksp

My main screen has a canvas, so... which is the best way to resize the canvas during the inizialitationp  pI have tried these two ways. My first way was to use CSS and set a percentage for its size. For example, width100 and height100. Despite the design worked, I found that there were a lot of issues when playing with the coords of my canvas. For example, when dragging an item, my mouse coords where amplified by ten times or so. Despite I could manage that, I think its not the best approach.p  pThe second way was to set a fixed size when the onload and onresize events when they are fired. I was doing something like thisp  precodewindow.initHeight  window.screen.height window.initWidth  window.screen.width The height of the navbar. navbar.height  document.getElementByIdnavbar.offsetHeight  canvas  document.getElementByIdcanvasStage canvas.width  window.initWidth canvas.height  window.initHeight  navbar.height  canvas.setAttributewidth, canvas.width canvas.setAttributeheight, canvas.height codepre  pThe problem is that the height seems to be too big a hrefhttpi.imgur.comWI0jGH2.png relnofollowhttpi.imgur.comWI0jGH2.pnga How could I fit the screen exactly through this wayp  pThe third way, but Ill try to avoid it, is to set a fixed size and let the small screens to scroll on the page.p  pThanksp  pUPDATED This is my JSFiddle a hrefhttpi.imgur.comNRTykLv.png relnofollowhttpi.imgur.comNRTykLv.pngap

The following code determines stronga hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiMachineepsilon relnofollowmachine epsilonastrongp  precodefloat computeeps    float eps  1.0f    while 1.0f  eps  1.0f     eps  2.0f    return eps  codepre  pIn the comments it was proposed that the code1.0f  eps  1.0fcode test might fail because C standard permits the use of extra precision. Although Im aware that floatingpoint operations are actually performed in higher precision than specified by the actual types used, I happen to disagree with this proposal.p  pI doubt that during the comparison operations, such as codecode or codecode, the operands are not truncated to the precision of their type. In other words, code1.0f  epscode can of course be evaluated with the precision higher than codefloatcode for example, codelong doublecode, and the result will be stored in the register that can accommodate codelong doublecode. However, I think that before performing the codecode operation left operand will be truncated from codelong doublecode to codefloatcode, hence the code can never fail to determine codeepscode precisely i.e. it can never do more iterations than intended.p  pI havent found any clue on this particular case in C standard. Furthermore, the code works fine and Im sure that the extra precision technique is used during its execution because I have no doubt that any modern desktop implementation in fact uses extra precision during calculations.p  pWhat do you think about itp

Negative 6159 pThe question pretty much boils down to Can I safely cast a function pointer to one with parameters convertible to those types, but that sounds extremely suspicious without a practical example.p  pI made a small utility function to call something from a DLL, given the DLL name, function name, the appropriate return type, and the parameter types and arguments. However, there might be extra bloat when using this utility than what is needed. Im wondering if its safe to not explicitly specify the parameter types. Taking the Windows API codeMessageBoxWcode as an examplep  precodecallStdcallDllFunctionltint, HWND, PCWSTR, PCWSTR, UINTgt     Luser32, MessageBoxW, nullptr, nullptr, nullptr, 0  codepre  pHere I explicitly specify the return type and four parameter types of codeMessageBoxWcode.

The arguments passed in still fit the actual function, though.

Negative 6159 pI am using the emSecurityServiceProviderem to secure my Silex application and would like to display a message after the user has logged out by navigating to the stronglogoutpathstrong route.p  pThe message should be stored in the sessions flash bag so that my template can automatically display it after.p  pI have tried adding an application middleware, but where not able to hook my code in. The before hook doesnt seem to work, because it happens after security and thus after the securitys redirected back to my home page.p  pThe before hook with the strongApplicationEARLYEVENTstrong seems to be to early because as far as I know does the Security provider destroy the session after logout.p  pBefore I keep trying to find a sort of working but probably dirty solution I would like to ask what the bestcleanest solution for this case would bep  pstrongUPDATEstrong After npms hint for a logout event handler I found a hrefhttpwww.reecefowell.com20111026redirectingonloginlogoutinsymfony2usingloginhandlers relnofollowthis articlea on Google, wich describes how to tackle the problem in Symfony very well.p  pIn Silex things are slightly different though and after reading the source of the emSecurityServiceProviderem I came up with this solution.p  pre classlangphp prettyprintoverridecodeapp[security.authentication.logouthandler.proto]  appgtprotectfunction name, options use app      return appgtsharefunction  use name, options, app          return new CustomLogoutSuccessHandler             app[security.httputils],             issetoptions[targeturl]  options[targeturl]                   class CustomLogoutSuccessHanler extends DefaultLogoutSuccessHandler       public function onLogoutSuccessRequest request              requestgtgetSessiongtgetFlashBaggtaddinfo, Logout success         return thisgthttpUtilsgtcreateRedirectResponserequest, thisgttargetUrl       codepre  pThe problem however is, that the flashbag message doesnt exist anymore after the redirect.

Negative 6159 pI have a div that has a click action that causes some animations on some other elements. Thats all working well and good. p  pThe problem is that there are some links within this div that have stopped working.p  pFor example, here is a simplified examplep  precodeltdiv classclickabledivgt     lta href onclickjavascriptmyfunctiongt ltdivgt  document.readyfunction    div.clickablediv.clickfunction        ...     codepre  pWhat can I do to run myfunction when that link is clickedp  pAnother consideration is that there is plain text and images within clickablediv.

When I click the mailto link, my browser does the mailto action opens a compose window in my mail client, but it also does .clickablediv.click. I would prefer that it doesnt do both.p

Negative 6159 pWe are experimenting with deploying an MVC app as an Azure web role. Currently the app is being hosted locally on our server. It has a few appSettings in Web.Config that can be changed by the users as part of the Administration module of the application.p  pI know this isnt a good practice for Azure because there will potentially be multiple instances of the application running with multiple Web.Configs, which makes updating them all a nightmare if not impossible. My understanding is that the ConfigurationSettings specified in the service definition should be used instead of Web.Config so that settings are defined globally in one place that all the instances of the application can access. p  pMy question is is it possible to programmatically update ConfigurationSettings similar to the way we update Web.Config settings, or would it be better for us to move those settings into a database or something elsep

Negative 6159 pIm trying to use powershell and Sharepoint 2013 CSOM to copy attachments of one item to a new item in another list.  Ive been able to successfully generate an attachments folder for the new item, so in theory all I need to do is move the files from the old attachments folder to the new one. CopyTo and MoveTo only seem to work for moving files within a list, so I thought to use OpenBinaryDirect and SaveBinaryDirect with the site context. However, in powershell, calling either of these methods results in the following error Method invocation failed because [System.RuntimeType] doesnt contain a method named OpenBinaryDirect.p  precodeattachments  item.AttachmentFiles ifattachments.Count gt 0      Creates a temporary attachment for the new item to genereate a folder, will be deleted later.     attCI  NewObject Microsoft.SharePoint.Client.AttachmentCreationInformation     attCI.FileName  TempAttach     enc  NewObject System.Text.ASCIIEncoding     buffer  [byte[]] enc.GetBytesTemp attachment contents     memStream  NewObject System.IO.MemoryStream ,buffer     attCI.contentStream  memStream     newItem.AttachmentFiles.AddattCI      ctx.loadnewItem     sourceIN  sourceList.Title     archIN  archList.Title     sourcePath    ListssourceINAttachments  item.Id     archPath    ListsarchINAttachments  newItem.Id     sFolder  web.GetFolderByServerRelativeUrlsourcePath     aFolder  web.GetFolderByServerRelativeURLarchPath     ctx.loadsFolder     ctx.loadaFolder     ctx.ExecuteQuery     sFiles  sFolder.Files     aFiles  aFolder.Files     ctx.loadsFiles     ctx.loadaFiles     ctx.ExecuteQuery     foreachfile in sFiles              fileInfo  [Microsoft.SharePoint.Client.File].OpenBinaryDirectctx, file.ServerRelativeUrl         [Microsoft.Sharepoint.Client.File].SaveBinaryDirectctx, archPath, fileInfo.Stream, true       ctx.ExecuteQuery codepre  pAny help on either getting the BinaryDirect methods to work or just a generalized strategy for copying attachments across lists using powershell  CSOM would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 6159 pI have a mobile web app hosted on a server currently. I would like to submit this to the Apple, Google, and Microsoft app stores, but all the PhoneGap samples involve packaging up all the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files and wrapping it. I want to make it even simplier by leaving the mobile web app hosted on the server and use PhoneGap only as an iframe to view the hosted app. That way, I can make updates that would propagate to all the devices without having to update through the app store. Also the main reason for me wanting to do this is because I have about 20GBs of audio and video files that I obviously cant packaging up into PhoneGap and place in the app store. Any help or advise would be greatly appreciatedp

Negative 6159 pI have a live wallpaper all set up for simplicitys sake, assume it consists of two rotating bitmaps positioned side by side, each rotating at different speeds also note that the bitmaps edges not the invisible box around the image, but rather the actual pixels of the drawing are touching.p  pI described the translate for each as a percentage of the canvas size a value between 0 and 1 multiplied by c.getHeight, and c.getWidth where c is a canvas.p  pAnyways, everything works fine as long the aspect ratio is maintained.

Is there any possibility to have some kind of dense output such that it is possible to interpolate these data to get the solution at arbitrary points without losing the high order of the integrator In Matlab this is easily possible using the function codedevalcode after the integration of one of the builtin ODE integrators. In SimMechanics I can select these integrators, too. Is there some kind of analouge way to codedevalcodep

Unfortunately, even livebinding the coderesponse.ipscode field without an index still presents a similar error. However, if I link it to the coderesultcode field, then it returns the success message inside the listview as expected.p  pI did take a look at a hrefhttpdelphi.org201309delphixe5mobilerestclientdemosource relnofollowJim McKeeths REST client examplea and that got me to the current point, but working out how to adapt it for my own data is proving a little challenging.  Ive noticed that the TRESTResponseDataSetAdapter also has its own codeFieldDefscode property, so Im not sure whether I should define my fields there or not.p  pI imagine Ive just got the data types setup incorrectly or missed something minor, but Id appreciate any assistance.p

Negative 6159 pI am working on using a Raspberry Pi in an embedded project that will utilize wifi to communicate with external devices. The device should be able to act either as a standalone wifi hotspot that devices can connect to or in the case of the presence of an existing wifi network it should connect to that network so that the user does not have to give up his internet connection in order to connect to the device. I plan on making the device start up in hotspot mode, the user can then use the web interface to enter the details of a network that he wants the device to connect to, whenever the specified parameters fails to establish a connection then it defaults back to hotspot mode.p  pNow the technical stuff I am struggling with is that I want to implement the control software in C running with Mono on Arch Linux on the Rapsberry Pi. I am struggling the find the Apis or libraries needed to manage the Linux wifi connection. On Windows it seems as if managedwifi.codeplex.com can be used but it does not seem to be compatible with Linux.p  pMy last resort would obviously be to execute shell commands and then parse their outputs, but considering how crude and possibly unreliable that would be this is obviously my last resort.p  pAny ideas regarding what I should dop  pPS. Another thing I might consider before using shell scripts, if it makes a difference is to use Raspbian or some other distro instead.p
Negative 6159 pSometimes, when running automated tests in PhantomJS using Cucumber for Rails 4, it would be really, really useful to actually sit in front of my screen, look in a window, and see exactly what the browser is doing.p  pThere are times when your code is right and your test is right, but testing fails intermittently nonetheless. Its often because of a script, or an animation, or some CSS that gets in the way. But seeing a screenshot, drilling into a DOM inspector, or using the debugger is not enough to catch those edge cases.p  pIs there any way to have a window looking at what PhantomJS is doing in the background It could be something in X Window, or running in a VNC Server, etc. Anything visual would greatly help with debugging, especially in with those finicky details.p  pI found a little program called a hrefhttpsgithub.comralfthewisephantomvnc relnofollowPhantomVNCa, but its not telling me much on how it works. It looks like something just feeding a series of screenshots through VNC.p  pI tried PhantomJS and CapybaraWebKit, but neither of those headless browsers other a head option. SeleniumWebDriver seems complicated to set up and only seems to work with a full browser like Firefox, and that may cause more problems than it solves.p  pIf you have any ideas, please let me know. Thank you in advance.p

It is very easy to use and the results are quite okay. But it only work for the images with just pure texts. So, i think it is not suitable.p  pThe second one i found is codeOcropuscode. It seems powerful but in its documentationp  blockquote   pWindowsp      pOCRopus relies a lot on POSIX path names and file systems.    You may be able to install OCRopus on Windows using .  An easier way   is to install VirtualBox and run OCRopus in Ubuntu under VirtualBox.p blockquote  pSo i think it is mostly for linux. I could not find a detail installation guide for window platform.  I am a beginner, so i could be wrongp  pThe third one i found is codepythontesseractcode , a wrapper for codeTesseract OCRcode. In their a hrefhttpcode.google.comppythontesseractpagea, the installation guide was provided. Basically, i need,p  ol lipythontesseractwin32.deb li lipythonopencvli linumpyli ol  pbut i have no clue on how to install code.debcode files on window. I have the codeopencvcode and codenampycode already installed.p  pSo the following are my questionsp  p1 In which way can i convert the table image into processable datais it even possiblep  p2 Is there any other useful OCR APIs that i have not mentioned here that could be helpfulp  p3 Finally, my silly idea Is it possible to split the image into small chucksbased on the size of the table cells  since the table dimensions are known using codePILcode and then use codepytessercode to convert each small images into text, thereafter process the data accordinglyp  pFYI I only need it for Windows Platform, possibly for windows xp 32 bits.

Negative 6159 pUPDATEDp  pSo i was just wondering if there is a way that i can get the creation date and time of a file. To simplify things soo far this is what i got p  precode Dim Storage As IsolatedStorageFile  IsolatedStorageFile.GetUserStoreForApplication     Dim directory As String  .SafeLockPLUSSavedAccounts.     Dim filenames As String  Storage.GetFileNamesdirectory     Dim dataSource As New ListOf SampleData     For Each filename As String In filenames         Dim ISF As IsolatedStorageFile  IsolatedStorageFile.GetUserStoreForApplication         Dim FS As IsolatedStorageFileStream  ISF.OpenFileSafeLockPLUSSavedAccounts amp filename, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read         Using SR As New StreamReaderFS             Dim Tme1 As String  Storage.GetLastWriteTimeSafeLockPLUSSavedAccounts amp filename.DateTime.ToStringCultureInfo.CurrentCulture.DateTimeFormat.ShortTimePattern             Dim DATESS As String  SR.ReadLine             Dim ReadName As String  SR.ReadLine             Dim DATESSx2 As String  SR.ReadLine             Dim Nte As String  SR.ReadLine             dataSource.AddNew SampleData With .Name  filename, .Description  ReadName, .Tme  Tme1, .Notes1  Nte         End Using     Next     SavedAccountslst.ItemsSource  dataSource codepre  pSo the time format of the file creation is like e.g. 322 p.m. 422 p.m. But the problem is that lets say i created the file on 12th, 11, 2013 at 234 p.m and i look at the file again on 14th, 11, 2013, the file creation date.time will show as 234 p.m even though it was created a while back. How can i do it so that it will show the time on the day it was created but if i check it sometime later e.g. 2 to 3 days later it will show something like 1112 or Tue. Just like how when you go to the message list, it shows the time but sometime later it will show the date of it and not the time.p  pThanksp

Negative 6159 pI am working within Xcode and have an iOS application that you input information and the app connects to a DB via a PHP file. There is no problem when uploading, a name or an email address. But for some reason when it comes to uploading a good amount of text, via a codeUITextViewcode, there becomes a problem. It succeeds when there are no punctuation at all. But when there is a period, or a question mark, it does not get uploaded to the server, it just fails.

Negative 6159 pI keep getting this error in my console, however theres no error in my coding when I look over it. It also keeps opening up the exact same JOptionPanes when I dont want it to open up.

Negative 6159 pIn a form ContractType I need the association to a Customer, which itself has an association to a Company and a BillingAddress. But the data itself of these 3 nested entities should not be editable at all in the contract view. Thats why the field for the customer ManyToOneRelation in the contract is hidden.p  pHowever for display purposes I need the whole customerobject in the form too incl. the underlying company and billing address  but as readonly. This is why I added an additional field strongcustomerFullObjectstrong to the contract formtype  which is not mapped emmapped  falseem. As it is an unmapped field, I set the data via a form event.p  pNow, when I edit the contract data, the company and billingaddressdata of the customer is nullified.br If I removecomment the whole strongcustomerFullObjectstrong part, everything is fine.p  pI dont understand, howwhy an unmapped field can change the data of an entity. How can I prevent Symfony from this Or is there a better patternway to achieve what I want I couldnt find anything in the docs.p  pBelow some code snippets from the strongmodelstrong removed namespaces for briefnessp  h3Contract.phph3  precode   ORMEntity   class Contract             var Customer       ORMManyToOnetargetEntityCustomer, inversedBycontracts       AssertTypetypeCustomer       AssertNotBlankmessage  customer.notBlank           private customer       Other fields left out as irrelevant.  codepre  h3Customer.phph3  precode   ORMEntity   class Customer             var Company       ORMOneToOnetargetEntityCompany       AssertNotBlankmessagecompany.notBlank           private company             var Address       ORMOneToOnetargetEntityAddress       AssertNotBlankmessagebillingAddress.notBlank           private billingAddress             var ArrayCollection       ORMOneToManytargetEntityContract, mappedBycustomer, orphanRemovaltrue, cascadeall           private contracts       Other fields left out as irrelevant.  codepre  h3ContractType.phph3  precodeclass ContractType extends AbstractType      public function buildFormFormBuilderInterface builder, array options          buildergtadd             customer,             customerHiddenType,             array                 label gt contract.customer,                                buildergtadd             customerFullObject,             customerType,             array                 cascadevalidation gt false,                 mapped gt false                                buildergtaddEventListenerFormEventsPOSTSETDATA, function FormEvent event                  form  eventgtgetForm                 editMode  formgtgetConfiggtgetOptioneditMode                 if emptyeditMode ampamp editMode  RequestActionCREATE                      formgtremovecustomerFullObject                  else                      formgtgetcustomerFullObjectgtsetDataeventgtgetDatagtgetCustomer                                                  Other children left out as irrelevant.           public function setDefaultOptionsOptionsResolverInterface resolver          resolvergtsetDefaults              array                  dataclass gt Contract,                  cascadevalidation gt true                                  public function getName          return contractType       codepre  h3CustomerType.phph3  precodeclass CustomerType extends AbstractType      public function buildFormFormBuilderInterface builder, array options          buildergtadd             company,             companyType,             array                 cascadevalidation gt false,                 label gt customer.company                                buildergtadd             billingAddress,             addressType,             array                 cascadevalidation gt false,                 label gt customer.billingAddress                                 Other children left out as irrelevant.           public function setDefaultOptionsOptionsResolverInterface resolver          resolvergtsetDefaults              array                  dataclass gt Customer,                  cascadevalidation gt true                                  public function getName          return customerType       codepre

Negative 6159 pIm trying to create a page in bootstrap that will have a list of twobutton groups. The primary button will trigger an event Im going to write later, but the goal is to have the button on the right of the button group which looks like a dropdown button to trigger an accordion under the button.p  pI have got it more or less working with the following issues 1 For some reason, the left side of the button group has rounded corners and the right side has sharp edges. Not a big deal, but irritating.p  p2There are some strange visual effects when triggering the accordion open. For a split second it appears to expand indefinitely, with strange lines on the right side of the box. Then everything snaps back to the way its supposed to look.p  p3 When collapsing the open accordion, the div simply disappears instead of smoothly scrolling back up.p  p4 There is a strange line below the second button, which I presume has something to do with the accordion panel but Im not sure.p  pAny help or hints would be appreciated.

If the user press Y, it continues, and asks Again after 1.000 more files, successfully and this goes on until all files has been scanned, then the program continues, and lists the files changed etc.p  pThe issue is, that if the user presses N for no, it just loops. Sits there asking again Do you wish to continue.p  pHow can I change this How can I make my program just stop after those 1.000 files if the user answered NO, but still have it list the files it has changedp

Based on my limited knowledge of C, I know that codestructscode are useful when you are modeling small, highlyrelated pieces of data, which is why I am currently using them in this fashion.p  pAll of these structs could realistically be made into a emConjugationTablesem codeclasscode, and would have, to a high degree, the same structure. Im unsure of whether to make these into a class, or use a different data structure that would be better suited to the problem. In order to give some more information about the problem specifications, Ill say the followingp  ol liOnce these values have been loaded from the XML file, they will strongnot be changedstrong.li liThese values will be strongreadfetched very oftenstrong.li liThe tablelike structure strongmust be maintainedstrong  that is to say that codeIndicativePresentcode must be nested under codeVerbFormscode the same applies to all other structs that are members of the codeVerbFormscode struct. These are conjugation strongtablesstrong after allli listrongPerhaps the most importantstrong I need the organization of the data to be set up in a way that, if for example a codeWordcode in the XML file does not have a codeGrammaticalFormcode of strongemverbemstrong, that no codeVerbFormscode struct will actually be created for that entry. This is in an effort to improve efficiency  why instantiate codeVerbFormscode if the word is not actually a verb This idea of avoiding unnecessary creation of these forms tables which are currently represented as codestruct XXXXXFormscode is absolutely imperative.li ol  hr  pIn accordance with primarily point strong4strong above, what kinds of data structures would be best used in modeling conjugation strongtablesstrong not emdatabaseem tables Do I need to change the format of my data in order to be compliant with 4 If I instantiate a codenew Wordcode, will the structs, in their current state, be instantiated as well and take up a lot of space Heres some math... after Googling around and eventually finding a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5690922sizeofemptystringincsharpthis questiona...p  pIn all the conjugation tables nouns, adjectives, verbs, there are a total of coincidence strong100strong codestringcodes allocated, and that are empty. So strong100strong x strong18strong bytes  strong1800 bytesstrong for each codeWordcode, at minimum, if these data structures are created and remain empty there will always be at least some overhead for the values that would actually be filled in. So assuming just randomly, could be more or less strong50,000strong codeWordcodes that would need to be in memory, thats strong90 million bytesstrong, or approximately strong85.8307strong megabytes.p  pThats a lot of overhead just to have empty tables. So what is a way that I can put this data together to allow me to instantiate strongonly certain tables noun, adjective, verbstrong depending on emwhat codeGrammaticalFormscode the codeWordcode actually hasem in the XML file.p  pI want these tables to be a member of the codeWordcode class, but only instantiate the tables that I need. I cant think of a way around it, and now that I did the math on the codestructscode I know that its not a good solution. My first thought is to make a class for each type of codeNounFormscode, codeAdjectiveFormscode, and codeVerbFormscode, and instantiate the class if the form appears in the XML file. Im not sure if that is correct though...p  pAny suggestionsp

Negative 6159 pWhen computing checkmate for a king in chess, do you determine the other players possible moves against your king Or do you consider merely their units reach If you say its the former, then there is a contradiction like this statement is false Consider this image with two kings a square apart and their knights protecting from above rooks. If we assume that the definition of possible moves must prevent check based on enemy possible moves, then the logic recursively alternates. p  blockquote   ol   liFirst, we say that our king is in check from the enemy knight so we are limited from moving our own knight because we must escape. li   liThen we realize that the knight does not have an available move into our kings square because he will be placing his king in check with our rook. He does not have our king in check after all.li   liThen we realize, free from check, that we are now able to move our own knight to the enemy king forcing him to move from check and preventing further his choices.li   liHowever, we notice that we cannot do this because it will place us in check with the enemy rook.li   liWe realize that since we cannot actually move our knight, the enemy king is not actually in check, therefore he is freely able to use his knight to attack our king.li   liGo to step 2 no matter how many times you have already.li   ol blockquote  pOkay, so maybe we assume that reach always counts regardless of the enemys check status. If our king is in reach of the enemy knights usual attack range, we consider it a check and must resolve it. Is this how the actual game is ruled though It seems an easy solution to the problem faced when programming the game logic, but Im not sure if it is correct or not.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com1OcXq.png altBoth in check, or neitherp  pI did some thinking and came up with this analysis I think you have proven that the scenario of both kings being in check not necessarily the scenario of the board I showed cannot exist by contradiction. Only one player can make a move at a time. Therefore, one player makes the initial move which transitions from the state of no kings being in check to some kings being in check. According to the rules, this move is not allowed if that players king results is in a check. I will point out the significance of results soon This means that no matter how check is defined, he cannot make any move if his king meets that condition. Therefore, the only transition to checks from no checks is to the enemy being in check. The enemy must escape check, still following the rule of not entering check in one move. The remaining state would be game over or that king escaping check.p  pSo I understand that both kings being in check is not possible.  Now the board I showed is either reachable or not reachable.  Lets assume the board is reachable and see if there is a contradiction. Lets ambiguously assume its whites turn since the scenario is symmetric.  This means black just moved. Therefore, blacks king is not in check. The black king is only reachable by the white knight. Therefore, the white knight must be restricted by some rule to not attack the black king. The only two possible rules that can enforce that conclusion arep  blockquote   ol   liThe white knight is currently protecting his king from check.li   liThe white king is in check already and that move will not solve the check.li   ol blockquote  pFirst, assume 2 is true regardless of 1. The white king is in check and the only piece in attack range is black knight. The black knight cannot attack the square containing king, however, because it would place his own king in check. Therefore 1 must be true and the white king is not in check. So both kings are not in check. We reverse the game board to see if this is reachable. Assume the scenario with the following alterations White has a bishop 2 up and 1 right from the black rook. The black king is one square to the left. The white king is one square to the right. No kings are in range of any other pieces, so it may be reasonable to assume this initial state is reachable. The black knight is protecting his king from the bishop, so it cannot move to under the white knight. The white king moves left. Now the white knight is protecting the white king and cannot move to under the black knight. The black king moves right one square. Thus, the scenario is reachable. The only questioned assumption standing is that when any moves are considered, it is safe to assume that the check rules are computed. Thus, a king may come in range of a unit which may not attack it due to prevention of his own king being in check. If this assumption is not made, then the pieces simply could follow the rules of not allowing kings to enter the unrestricted attack range of an enemy unit. Now, it is interesting to see if this scenario is computable without infinite loops. For dependencies, I will use arrows. For the initial white king moving left, white king  black knight stopped  white bishop attack black king Those are single step computations, no loops in dependencies so far. For the black king to move right,  black king  white knight stopped  black rook attack white king Still no dependencies. What about when we now try to check white knights available moves including attacking the black king white knight stopped  black rook attack white king What about if the white rook attacks the black rook white rook stopped  black knight attack white king Whites remaining options are to move the king to the right or down.p  pOur conclusion,p  blockquote   ol   liMoving to this board state is possible without breaking the dont move into check rule.li   liThis board state obviously assumes that computing check depends on possible enemy moves, not their simple native attack ranges.li   liWhen this state is reached, both kings are not in check.li   liIt is at least possible that this is not a stalemate. Unknown if alwaysli   ol blockquote  pSo I finally found rules on wikipedia about placing another king in check even if it compromises ones own king. So, we cannot make our assumption in part 2, thus the board state is not reachable. A piece unable to move because it would place its own king in check it is pinned against its own king may still deliver check to the opposing player. Thus our final conclusion for the apparent actual rules of chess, the board state is not reachable as it follows the check rules.p  pI am going to choose icedtrees answer because of the valuable logic which follows the game rulesp  precodeif for every move for player X ignoring rules about king threats,  player Y can capture player Xs king next turn,  then player X is in checkmate. codepre  pHowever, I would fix them to be the followingp  precodeX is checkmate if and only if      For all legal movesmove according to rule definition X         There exists a generic movelegal move A ignoring rules of protecting king A Y such that            X king is captured               codepre

Negative 6159 pI am working on a fairly large project that has a ton of external dependencies. I have been working on debug build during development for a while. Now, when I try and build release after a long time, I get an error saying that a particular symbol is not found. In my case specifically, the linker gives me an error saying codestartthreadnoexceptcode symbol is not found. This symbol is expected to be found in boostthread but when I examine the version of boostthread I have using codenm G D demanglecode, I find that indeed this symbol is not found I do find a symbol named codestartthreadcode though. Apparently, the noexcept symbol can be found in more recent versions of the library.p  pMy question however, is more generic. What I want to do now, is to find the origin of this symbols requirement. I am guessing that there must be some new function call I am making which in turn invokes the codestartthreadnoexceptcode function. Clearly, there must be a code.ocode file generated when compiling my code, that I can trace this requirement down to. Either that, or I have added some new third party dependency which in turn requires the new version of the boostthread library. How can I find what codelibrary requires this undefined symbolp

Negative 6159 pThis might seem like a strange question, however it suddenly hit me that i might be doing this wrong...p  pSo, Ive been working on an application for a while, and recently we switched from open source solutions to Microsoft solutions for the backend OS, Database, Webserver.p  pNow, previously Ive been using standard java web services for pulling and pushing data into our DB, however the vast majority of that has now been replaced with application roles and direct DB access from our clients This is internal, no less of a security concernp  pWe still have a single application that i had planned to continue the use of web services with, this simply works as a single login, patching and launch platform for our other software, a basic portal. However reading up on .net services, web api and WCF Im suddenly struck by the sensation that perhaps web services are in fact not the way to go here.p  pSo basically, the services perform the following functionsp  ol liTaking a usernamepassword for the client, and confirming successful login.li liRetrieving the version information for a list of installed applications.li liChanging the users password Resetting the password in the event it was forgotten.li ol  pNow, are web services really the best or more, simply a reasonable way of providing this functionality, or would a more standard client server setup be a more reasonable way of achieving this, or perhaps im simply over thinking the casep
Negative 6159 pI want to ask for a little more detail to the same question posted by Zeller over a year ago...p  piThe javadoc says that the service returned by codeExecutors.newCachedThreadPoolcode reuses threads. How is this possibleip  pI get how the queue structure is setup internally, what I dont see is how it reuses threads in the queue.p  pAll examples Ive seen have the developer create an instance of their thread and pass it in through the execute method.p  pFor example...p  precodeExecutorService executor  Executors.newCachedThreadPool for int i  0 i lt 10 i                Runnable worker  new WorkerThreadi  will create 10 instances             executor.executeworker             codepre  pI understand that a thread pool can easily manage the life cycle of each thread, but again, I see no methods nor the ability to access or restart any of the threads in the pool.p  pIn the above example, I would then expect that each thread would be started, run, terminated and disposed of by the thread pool, but never reused.p  pA messaging system would be an example of where youd need this.  Say you have an onMessage handler and youd like to reuse one of the threads in the pool to handle it, so Id expect methods like...p  precodeworker  executor.getIdleThread worker.setDatamessage executor.resubmitworker           codepre  por maybe have the ExecutorService acting as a factory class and have it return an instance of your threads, where internally it decides to create a new one or reuse an old one.p  precodeExecutorService executor  Executors.newCachedThreadPoolWorkerThread Runnable worker  executor.getThread worker.setDatamessage codepre  pSo Im missing something.  Its probably something simple but Ive spent the afternoon reading tutorials and examples and still havent figured it out.  Can someone shed some light on the subjectp

Negative 6159 pIn my application, I have been adding support for NSTextView allowing subviews to work naturally with the text editor.

So the cookie is deleted and Im not able to access codeanimalscode after the page has loaded.p  pThis happens in both FF and Chrome. The problem is only on page refresh if I go to a different site and then come back, or come to the page for the first time, the cookie is properly set.p  pIs there any way I can get the browser to understand not to delete the cookie, and instead use the new parameters When does the browser decide to the delete the cookie, and why doesnt it look at the new params coming in from PHPp  pPossible solutions I would call them hacks are to add a unique identifier to each cookie i.e. a timestamp so animals1407435704, so that each page load has its own cookie. I could also echo out a codedocument.cookiecode from PHP that sets the cookie, so after the page loads, the JS sets the cookie.

Negative 6159 pI have a test in a project I have inherited that looks similar to thisp  precodestdstring valuetest string const char  buffer  value.cstr EXPECTCALLobject, foo,,buffer, buffer.size, .WillOnceReturn0 barvalue codepre  pThe buffer is a char  pointing to a string of data.  I have inserted dummy values like object just to focus on the issue which seems to be in the use of EXPECTCALL.  Right after this EXPECTCALL a method bar is called that takes the original string value as a parameter and then within the method calls foo with a buffer built from the original string value.p  pThis test is working on the Mac build of this project, but failing on the Windows version.  It seems to be comparing the pointer addresses for the two char pointers, the expected and the actual, and then failing because they are different.  The method foo is definitely called within bar.p  pIf this test method EXPECTCALL compares the pointers addresses and not the data at that pointer then shouldnt the test fail on Mac as wellp  pIs anyone familiar with a distinct difference between Mac and windows when using EXPECTCALL and pointersp  pError I am seeing p  precodeunknown file error Unexpected mock function call  returning default value.

Negative 6159 pI would like to have a POSIX environment in Windows to be used as a system shell and at the same time produce native Windows executables. One option in the past was to install Cygwin and MinGW and possibly call MinGW compiler binaries from Cygwin. p  pNow an x64  MinGW is available straight as a Cygwin  package and there are some a hrefhttpgo.kblog.us201209settingupmingw64withcygwin.html relnofollowblogsa documenting how to get them  play nicely together. p  pBefore adopting  this solution, I would like to know how and if the Cygwin  package is different from a standalone  MinGWw64. Specifically which one is more efficient in producing native Win64 exes Is Cygwin  package itself based on native executables, or is an extension to its gcc compilersp  h2Updateh2  pSome of you miscomprehended  this questionp  pemI am not interested in the difference between  Cygwin and  MinGW  at all.emp  pand by the way, on the  very home  page of  a hrefhttpmingw.org relnofollowMinGWa their main concern is to show how they differentiate from Cygwinp  pMy question instead is very specific I am interested in the difference between a specific strongCygwin packagestrong and its standalone version.br This package happens to be mingw64x8664, which is  split in several dependencies files, of which  the most relevant is perhaps mingw64x8664gcccore. p  pSorry, but references found in some comments are utterly wrong with respect to what is asked here first they address  to Cygwin as a whole and not the mentioned package secondly they refer to a rather old MinGW version, significantly different from that mentioned here see here for the a hrefhttpsourceforge.netpmingww64wiki2Feature20list relnofollowdifferencesa.br Someone also mentions MSYS2, which is a modern  Cygwin fork, but again I am not interested to Cygwin as whole, but to the said package. p  pSome of you might not be aware of this package, and in fact, if you google for mingw64x8664, you dont find anything relevant for the Cygwin package, and most likely land on the general version, and this is why I am posting here. p

Negative 6159 pProblem so im trying to make a program in processing which im running with java, so its based on java. The program makes a grid of 3dimensional points and does stuff with them. right now its drawing small circles on them to verify that its working. i was in the process of debugging to find why all the circles werent drawing and i somehow created an error i cant get rid of. no matter what i do theres always a nullpointerexception error on line 43. ive tried making a new script file and copypasting the code into there, restarting the processing IDE, etc, but nothing seems to fix it. I can add statements above or below to manipulate which line is 43 but it doesnt change the error.. anyone here familiar with processing that can help me out i dont know how to interpret the error message outside of reading it as look at line 43 for something being called as a null so thats why im confused.p  pCode  p  precodeint sizex  20 int sizey  20 int framewidth  800 int frameheight  800 int[][] points  new int[framewidthsizex1frameheightsizey1][]  void setup   noLoop   background255   sizeframewidth,frameheight,P3D   ellipseModeCENTER    forint x  0 xltframewidthsizex x     forint y  0 yltframeheightsizey y       int[] point   xsizex,ysizey,0       printnxx yy placeplace       points[xframewidthsizexy]  point       place           void draw   int sinstep  0   forint count  0 count lt points.length count     int[] temp  points[count]     temp[2]int100Math.sinsinstep100     points[count]  temp      sinstep    forint x  0 xltframewidthsizex x     forint y  0 yltframeheightsizey y       printx, y       int[] p  1,2,3       findx,y       ellipsep[0],p[1],10,10               void findint x, int y   printyourmom   This is where the error is int[] temp  points[x1framewidthsizexy   int[] z  x,y,xy  codepre  pError Messagep  precodejava.lang.RuntimeException java.lang.NullPointerException at com.jogamp.common.util.awt.AWTEDTExecutor.invokeAWTEDTExecutor.java58 at jogamp.opengl.awt.AWTThreadingPlugin.invokeOnOpenGLThreadAWTThreadingPlugin.java103 at jogamp.opengl.ThreadingImpl.invokeOnOpenGLThreadThreadingImpl.java206 at javax.media.opengl.Threading.invokeOnOpenGLThreadThreading.java172 at javax.media.opengl.Threading.invokeThreading.java191 at javax.media.opengl.awt.GLCanvas.displayGLCanvas.java541 at processing.opengl.PJOGL.requestDrawPJOGL.java688 at processing.opengl.PGraphicsOpenGL.requestDrawPGraphicsOpenGL.java1651 at processing.core.PApplet.runPApplet.java2256 at java.lang.Thread.runThread.java745 Caused by java.lang.NullPointerException at triangles.drawtriangles.java43 at processing.core.PApplet.handleDrawPApplet.java2386 at processing.opengl.PJOGLPGLListener.displayPJOGL.java862 at jogamp.opengl.GLDrawableHelper.displayImplGLDrawableHelper.java665 at jogamp.opengl.GLDrawableHelper.displayGLDrawableHelper.java649 at javax.media.opengl.awt.GLCanvas10.runGLCanvas.java1289 at jogamp.opengl.GLDrawableHelper.invokeGLImplGLDrawableHelper.java1119 at jogamp.opengl.GLDrawableHelper.invokeGLGLDrawableHelper.java994 at javax.media.opengl.awt.GLCanvas11.runGLCanvas.java1300 at java.awt.event.InvocationEvent.dispatchInvocationEvent.java302 at java.awt.EventQueue.dispatchEventImplEventQueue.java733 at java.awt.EventQueue.access200EventQueue.java103 at java.awt.EventQueue3.runEventQueue.java694 at java.awt.EventQueue3.runEventQueue.java692 at java.security.AccessController.doPrivilegedNative Method at java.security.ProtectionDomain1.doIntersectionPrivilegeProtectionDomain.java76 at java.awt.EventQueue.dispatchEventEventQueue.java703 at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpOneEventForFiltersEventDispatchThread.java242 at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpEventsForFilterEventDispatchThread.java161 at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpEventsForHierarchyEventDispatchThread.java150 at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpEventsEventDispatchThread.java146 at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpEventsEventDispatchThread.java138 at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.runEventDispatchThread.java91 codepre
Negative 6159 pIm not completely sure this is a bug in carousel, but it really looks like it.p  pIm using a carousel to display boat pictures. When I click on a button, a function to get a list of pictures by boat ID is executed and the list of pictures is retrieved from the database. First time, everything works perfectly. I can see the carousel displaying the pictures. However, if I click on this button for a second time, the function is run again, and the slide images are changed dynamically. This time, the carousel disappears. Just to check if the function worked and the pictures are there, I use Chrome tools to check the code. I can confirm that the slides with the pictures are there. However, there are some differences between both generated codes. Please, find the carousel code attached twice.  The first one is when the core is working. The second one is when the code is not working when I click the button and run the function for second time.p  pHere is the carousel source codep  precodeltdiv idboatCarousel classcarousel slide

What I think the pregmatch is doing and intend for it to do is return true if there are any number of AZ, az, 09, , commas, or spaces followed by PM. How is this wrongp  pThank you in advancep

Or just coding the images into the HTML, and then have one partial for the rest of the data.

If theres only one client at a time, the error doesnt happen. p  pThings I have tried so far p  ul livarying SSL options such as session caching li liCRYPTOsetlockingcallback on both server and clients is already set without that, server generally falls apart at some point on heavy loadli liserializing SSLaccept and SSLshutdown on server, so that only one happens at a timeli livarying protocol options all defaults, TLSv1 only, etc li ul  pNone of that helps. The clients still get the above error sporadically.  The only thing that does help is omitting SSLshutdown on server side.  That eliminates the error, however that results in slow but steady leak of handles on the server, which otherwise doesnt happen.p  pWhat am I doing wrong  p

Negative 6159 pI implemented a custom HashMap class in C, but shouldnt matter. The implementation is simple p  ul liA large array holds pointers to Items.li liEach item contains the key  value pair, and a pointer to an Item to form a linked list in case of key collision.li liI also implemented an iterator for it.li ul  pMy  implementation of incrementingdecrementing the iterator is not very  efficient. From the present position, the iterator scans the array of  hashes for the next nonnull entry. This is very inefficient, when the  map is sparsely populated which it would be for my use case.p  pCan anyone suggest a faster implementation, without affecting the complexity of other operations like insert and find My primary use case is find, secondary is insert. Iteration is not even needed, I just want to know this for the sake of learning.p  pPS  Why I implemented a custom class Because I need to find strings with  some error tolerance, while ready made hash maps that I have seen  provide only exact match.p  pstrongEDITstrong To clarify, I am talking about incrementingdecrementing an already obtained iterator. Yes, this is mostly done in order to traverse the whole map.p  pThe errors in strings keys in my case occur from OCR errors. So I can not use the error handling techniques used to detect typing errors. The chance of fist character being wrong is almost the same as that of the last one. p  pAlso, my keys are always string, one word to be exact. Number of entries will be less than 5000. So hash table size of 216 is enough for me. Even though it will still be sparsely populated, but thats ok.p  pMy hash functionp  phash code size is 16 bits.p  pFirst 5 bits for the word length.  Max possible key length  32. Reasonable, given that key is a single word.p  pLast 11 bits for sum of the char codes. I only store the English alphabet characters, and do not need case sensitivity. So 26 codes are enough, 0 to 25. So a key with 32 z  25  32  800. Which is well within 211. I even have scope to add case sensitivity, if needed in future.p  pNow when you compare a key containing an error with the correct one,  say hell with hello 1. Length of the keys is approx the same 2. sum of their chars will differ by the sum of the droppedaddeddistorted chars.p  pin the hash code, as first 5 bits are for length, the whole table has fixed sections for every possible length of keys. All sections are of same size. First section stores keys of length 1, second of length 2 and so on.p  pNow hello is stored in the 5th section, as length is 5.When we try to find hello,  Hashcode of hello  length  1 sum of chars  4 7  4  11  11  14  4 47  0010000000101111p  psimilarly, hashcode of helo  336  0001100000100100 p  ol liWe jump to its bucket, and dont find it there.li liso we try to check for ONE distorted character. This will not change the length, but change the sum of characters by at max 25 to 25. So we search from 25 places backwards to 25 places forward. i.e, we check the sum part from 3625 to 3625 in the same section. We wont find it.li liWe check for an additional character error. That means the correct string would contain only 3 characters. So we go to the third section. Now sum of chars due to additional char would have increased by max 25, it has to be compensated. So search the third section for appropriate 25 places 36  0 to 36  25. Again we dont find.li liNow we consider the case of a missing character. So the original string would contain 5 chars. And the second part of hashcode, sum of chars in the original string, would be more by a factor of 0 to 25. So we search the corresponding 25 buckets in the 5th section, 36  0 to 36  25. Now as 47 the sum part of hello lies in this range, we will find a match of the hashcode. Ans we also know that this match will be due to a missing character. So we compare the keys allowing for a tolerance of 1 missing character. And we get a matchli ol  pIn reality, this has been implemented to allow more than one error in key. It can also be optimized to use only 25 places for the first section since it has only one character and so on. Also, checking 25 places seems overkill, as we already know the largest and smallest char of the key. But it gets complex in case of multiple errors.p

I do it by using codeaddRowcode and codecheckAddRowcode method on my controller. these methods are as follows p  precodescope.checkAddRow  function index                  if index  scope.transaction.Entries.length  1                      scope.addRow                                            scope.addRow  function                   entry                       EntryTime ,                     DebitAmount ,                     CreditAmount ,                     AccountId                                   scope.transaction.Entries.pushentry                 console.logscope.transactionForm                           scope.deleteRow  function index                  scope.transaction.Entries.spliceindex, 1                 console.logscope.transactionForm              codepre  pAgain this part is just fine and works well. But I have another requirement that says that if last entry is not used it should not cause the form to invalidate. It should rather be removed from codetransaction.Entriescode collection and rest of the data should be saved normally. To achieve this, I have codecreatecode function defined on codescopecode that looks like followingp  precodescope.create  function                   scope.submitted  true                 if scope.transactionForm.entryForm ampamp scope.transactionForm.entryForm.invalid ampamp scope.transactionForm.entryForm.pristine                       timeoutfunction                           scope.deleteRowscope.transaction.Entries.length  1                                           timeoutfunction                           console.logFrom time out, scope.transactionForm.valid                         console.logscope.transactionForm.valid                         if scope.transactionForm.valid return                          alertdata saved                         console.logscope.transactionForm                         scope.transactionForm.name.focus                     , 200                                   else                      if scope.transactionForm.valid                          alertdata saved 2                                                     codepre  pYou can see that what codecreatecode function is doing. It is checking if codeentryForm ngformcode is present in the main form codetransactionFormcode then it checks if codeentryFormcode is codeinvalidcode and codepristinecode if all these flags are true then, I delete the last entry from codescope.transaction.Entriescode and save the data currently an alert to show data is saved after codetimeoutcode. If I dont use timeout then the form is invalid so I have to wait for 200ms before I check the forms codevalidcode flag after removing last row. But to my surprise when I remove last row from create function, there is no codeentryFormcode attached to the outer codetransactionFormcode. On the other hand If I delete entries using delete buttons present on UI, the codeentryFormcode is present inside the main codetransactionFormcode. Can anyone explain why is that. I have added codeltpregttransactionFormjsonltpregtcode at the end to see when it is and when it is not available on main form. I have created a a hrefhttpplnkr.coeditJVxMUYgH70m7a0VWov98ppreview relnofollowplunka to show what I mean. just add some data in two input fields of the master portion, enter some data in accountid field of both entries, when you reach the Credit input of second last entry, a new entry will be automatically added. Ignore that row and just push create button. The last entry will be removed and data will save but the codeentryFormcode will not be there anymore. I am not sure what I am doing wrong.p

Negative 6159 pI am relatively new to Storm and I am attempting to create a topology that will take in a file, parse the contents and then run a third party API to do some analytics on that content.p  pI have a topology, one spout, and three bolts. Basically the spout feeds the file to the first bolt which will extract the file content. Then the second bolt will run the third party analytic, and the last bolt will write everything to an xml string representation.p  pI have tested that the first two bolts were working as expected, but the issue came when I added the last bolt. It seems that the second bolt takes a long time to run and Storm is timing out. The execution time of the third party code takes around 37 seconds.

Negative 6159 pI have an Android app that one can use to store useful information on all the wines one tastes name, year, price, how good it is.... So as to allow users to exchange information between one another or accros their different devices, I have a Serialization mechanism that allows user top  ul liexport all the Wines into a .ser fileli lichoose Wines to import from any such fileli ul  pThis works fine.p  pHowever, some time ago, I got a request to also export the pictures that one can add to a Wine description. So I modified my Wine class which implements Serializable to add a byte[] attribute.p  pAnd this is where trouble begins when exporting my Wines with pictures, I get a bStreamCorruptedExceptionb. p  precodejava.io.StreamCorruptedException at java.io.ObjectOutputStream.writeObjectObjectOutputStream.java1528 at java.io.ObjectOutputStream.writeObjectObjectOutputStream.java1481 at [...].WineVectorSerializer2.runWineVectorSerializer.java84 codepre  pI toyed a little with the way I created the byte array from the Bitmap and kept reducing size, until it finally worked. I dont know why, but the Exception is triggered when my .ser file reaches 1.3Mo.p  pSo if I export all the pictures in crappy quality, everything works. If I increases it just a little bit, then I get the exception when the export file becomes too big less than 2 Mo isnt that much  and I got plenty of free space on my SD card.p  pI tried to add a Thread.sleep1000 between each call to writeObject, but it didnt help.p  pbrbrp  h1Code samplesh1  h2iSerialize into a fileih2  precodeFileOutputStream fos  new FileOutputStreamfilename final ObjectOutputStream out  new ObjectOutputStreamfos  for Wine aWine data     try      aWine.loadImage     out.writeObjectaWine     out.flush       catch IOException e      Log.eSerialize, Error during export     exportError  true     handle.sendMessagehandle.obtainMessage     break      finally      aWine.freeImage      handle.sendMessagehandle.obtainMessage  out.close codepre  pIn the above snippet, you can see that I call strongloadImagestrong [see next snippet] and strongfreeImagestrong.

Negative 6159 pI have a C program, a Linux driver and a Bash script. The C program will communicate with the FPGA through the driver. To program the FPGA, I need to unload the driver, program FPGA and reload driver afterwards. And those are the tasks in the Bash script. p  pBasically what I want to achieve is when the C program receives a particular command from the client program, it will launch the Bash script to kill the C program, unload driver, program FPGA, load back the driver and start again the C program. But when I use codesystemcode , codeforkcode and codeexeclcode to launch the script within the C program, the rmmod is not successful with error message resources temporarily unavailable. Looks like the driver thinks the C program is still using it.p  pBut I thought when I use codeforkcode and codeexeclcode, if I kill the C program from other process will free up the driver, no What should I do to kill the program and unload the driverp

Negative 6159 pId like to use Elasticsearch and i think it is a good idea to set an Index like that emem. I want to use one shard per index and to make a query over all years I made an alias  and put all new Index for every month per costumer into it.  I just use one shard per index because they data per month could be between   1GB to 1050 GB. p  pMy question Is my planing good or is it bad any recommendation  For example I collect data over 2 years and search with an alias , ES has to go through 24 Indexes. Does this make any performance problems I could index per year but then i need to make more shards per costumer and some of them could be very small to many shards for just a few GB and others will be very big e.g. 10 shards and over 50 GB per Shard, the index is very big.

Negative 6159 pIs it possible to incorporate resizebox into stargazer in R  Im trying to create a table that is too wide to fit, even on landscape perspective.  I manually added resizeboxtextwidth  begintabular endtabular  to the .tex file, and I like how it looks.  However, Id like for my .Rnw file to be complete, so that I can generate pdf perfectly without additional changes to the .tex file.p  pOn a related note, stargazer causes pdflatex to output multiple warnings due to it including label when no label is specified.  These dont affect the pdfs creation, but they cause confusion when there are other errors present.p  pAgain, I can manually delete these lines from the .tex file, or assign label names.  However, I would like to simply tell stargazer not to include this line at all.p

There can be a number of these lists on each view, so it quickly gets out of hand.p  pMy idea was to use the using pattern to create the list container, then the Enumerator pattern to provide a reference to each item back to the View, as suchp  precode    using HtmlListltLocationgt list  Html.BeginListlocations              while list.MoveNext                      list.Current.Item.Name               codepre  pThere are generic constraints in play on that helper function, so it only accepts models which implement the interfaces it needs to work.p  pThis works quite well, but there is a massive problem  I need to be able to control certain properties on the link itself, while automatically generating others.

Negative 6159 pI am using the DHTMLX scheduler. Basically what I am doing is a AJAX GET request to the server to get my data, and then load the events using their method addEvent. So I have quite a bit of data to load on the scheduler and I understand that this can take time. I can have from 20 to 2500 events to add to the scheduler, I use personnalized query to my server to optimize the request on each view. The GETAJAX request takes no time. But loading the events in the calendar takes forever and not only does it take a long time, it freezes the browser. I thought the events were loading but werent showing because it was just slow so I created a progress bar. But I then realized that the browser hangs while doing the loop so I dont even see the spinner I implemented. The only way to see the events actually being loaded and to see the spinner is to add breakpoints like you can see here img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com1gC8B.png altenter image description herep  pCan anyone help me with this Is there a way to make my code better or at least make the spinner show as it is loading the events So the user knows what is hapenning When I add a console.log in the for each I can also see it in the console incrementing, and it does it pretty fast, considering that theres a lot of data it can take between 1 second and 35 or so, and Im okay with that, I just wish it didnt hang.p  pHeres my code p  precode.each data, function key, event      var eventObj  scheduler.getEventevent.ActivityIdint   var type  typeofme.scheduler.getEventevent.ActivityIdint    iftypeofme.scheduler.getEventevent.ActivityIdint  undefined               var text            ifevent.Titre  null                     text  event.Titre     event.Ressource    event.Employe                  else               text  event.Ressource      event.Employe              me.scheduler.addEvent                id event.ActivityIdint,                  startdate Global.formatDateTimeevent.LocalStartDateTime,                  enddate   Global.formatDateTimeevent.LocalEndDateTime,                  text  text,                                         color Global.RandGandBToSchedulerRGBevent.ColorR,event.ColorG,event.ColorB,                  descact  event.DescAct,                  priorite event.Priorite,                  ressourceid event.ResourceId,                  ressourcename event.Ressource,                  textColor black                      n         progress.updatendata.length  100      console.logLoading these events yall   codepre  pAlso instead of clearing the events completly when I change view, I just check if the events from the request are already loaded, which increases performance immensly but it still hangs even if I dont add any event aka if I come back to a view where I have already loaded all the events.p

In fact, I guess the queued command execution will face the same problem Ill grab the message later and have to look up the handler somehow.p  pSo my options that I can see arep  ol liDont use codeICommandExecutorcode as a dependency, just use codeICommandHandlerltgtcodes directly.  But I wanted the option of wrapping all command handler execution through a standard class  to catch exceptions in a consistent way, or manage execution in some other consistent way.  I really like the option of having a consistent interface for immediatedeferred execution either call Write or Executeli liPass the DI container or root into codeICommandExecutorcode and let it resolve commands.  This seems to break the idea that there should be one call to compose an object graph with DI, and might hide dependenciesli liHave the implementation of codeICommandExecutorcode have all codeICommandHandlerltgtcodes as a dependency to be injected  so it can pick the one it wants manually.  However that doesnt seem ideal either, since all handlers on the system would be instantiated at that pointli ol  pIs there are fourth option or do I need to bite the bullet with one of these compromisesp

Negative 6159 pI am trying to come up with an algorithm to determine the dominant color in an image either taken from a devices camera or by selecting an existing photo in the photo library.  I have written an iOS 8 application in Swift that can grab the RGB value of each pixel in the image, but I dont really know what to do from there.  p  pFor pixels that have a distinct dominant color, say RGB230, 15, 30, its pretty easy to determine the dominant color.  However, I dont really know what to do for pixels that have RGB values where 2 of the 3 values are similar, say RGB200, 215, 30.p  pMy original thought was to keep 3 counters one for each color and add each pixels corresponding RGB values to that counter.  At the end I would divide each counter by the total number of pixels and the max of the 3 values would be the dominant color.  However, like I mentioned before, when the results are close to each other I cant say that one color necessarily dominates the other.p  pJust looking for some thoughts and suggestionsp

Negative 6159 pI want to be able to push a button in an app running on my Android phone and have a power switch on a real circuit literally attached to the phone be turned onoff. Im having trouble thinking of a good way to do it. So far Ive thought ofp  p1 Using an Arduino The biggest problem with this is that the Arduino needs to be loaded with a sketch in order to work, and I cant use a PC to do the job. Ive seen Arduino Commander but its freemium and not open source, and I need to write my own custom app. It seems that I would have to find a way to load sketches and also write my own driver. This is not a pleasing course of action.p  p2 Playing an audio tone from the earphone jack The idea is to play a tone that can then be converted into a small DC voltage. That DC voltage will then be used as the gate voltage to a MOSFET, which will act as the switch. The problem with this is that undesired audio can unexpectedly turn on the switch. For my application, even a small chance of this is unacceptable. Even filtering doesnt eliminate interference completely. Can I some how exclude all other sources of sound and only have an audio tone as output If not over the headphone jack itself, over Bluetoothp  pIf anyone has any helpful thoughts, please share them.p

Negative 6159 pI have searched SO for this question, but they were a bit different than mine. My problem is that I dont want to receive a signal from another thread, but I want to send one.

Negative 6159 pI want to make a couple of vec4 vertex attributes in my shaders.

I finally got the headers I want to appear but maybe it will provide someone with more context Now, when I send the PUT, its gets preflighted with the OPTIONS request, but the response I receive is a 405 that does not seem to include the headers I want.  Specifically, in the response headers, I do not see AccessControlAllowHeaders as a header at all.  My first thought is that for some reason my web.configs settings are being ignored, because otherwise I would see AccessControlAllowHeaders included, and that if AccessControlAllowHeaders were to exist in the response headers, my OPTIONS method would be accepted and proceed to the PUT.. but Ive hit a wall because I dont know how to modify the headers outside of web.config.p  pIs this a even a correct assumption Does anyone have a similar experience, or perhaps advice on how to ensure my custom header settings are included in my servers response  Thank you so much, this has been stumping me for quite some timep

Negative 6159 pIm currently working on a database that comes with a legacy project which uses EntityFramework updates code based on existing database using Data Model Designerp  pCurrently I work on the master copy and our developers work locally using SQL Server mergereplications on their local PC. p  pIssue here is that we recently started doing some change work that modifies the database schema, so when we use schema comparison visual studio SQL compare feature, there are huge number of replication sp amp schema changes that basically if I do update it will corrupt the live database.  So my current solution is remove the dev server replication so that the schema goes back to what it should look like without replication changes, then do the schema compare amp update, and then create a new merge replication again so our developers can continue working on the dev db.p  pI thought it was just oneoff db schema change, but just realized it will be continuous changes at least for the next 36 months, so that basically make each release a big headache if it can be called as a release prep...p  pMy SQL amp EntityFramework knowledge is limited, can anyone shed some light on this for me pleasep  pThanks in advancep

Any suggestions on how to streamline the code to be faster andor how to send and receive the right data would be much appreciatedp  pPython p  precodesources httpstackoverflow.comquestions676172fullexamplesofusingpyserialpackage for more info httppyserial.sourceforge.netpyserialapi.html  import serial  import time  sets the connection parameters, relook at when know more ser  serial.Serial     port COM4,      baudrate  9600,      parity  serial.PARITYODD,      stopbits  serial.STOPBITSTWO,      bytesize  serial.EIGHTBITS,     timeout  5       def decToPercent decimal     maps value from 01 to 0255 and makes into an interger, then to hex     intPercent  rounddecimal255     return intPercent  ser.isOpen    returns true  firstContact  False  inByte  0 wrist  0.9         setup of variables which I will get from dictionary of other code once integrate elbow  0       assuming variables will be included in 01     wristPerc  decToPercentwrist elbowPerc  decToPercentelbow  forceBytes  bytearray[wristPerc, elbowPerc]      puts the motor values into an array as hex printforceBytes  set up initial contact with the arduino  inByte  ser.read1 printinByte  while True     if firstContact  False          if inByte  bA              firstContact  True             ser.writea.encode             inByte  ser.read1      else          ser.writeforceBytes         time.sleep0.05         printser.readline codepre  pInitially I had the code start  and go back through the whole while statement after  using this code, however I took it out because I think it was making the flow of code mess up the outputs a littlep  precode    starts the process over again, clears so that have time to get information     firstContact  False             inByte  ser.read1     printinByte codepre  pArduino codep  precodeSee Arduino Cookbook chapter 4 for info on sending and recieving multiple messages in one See example of serial call response for strategy on how to process information faster int motorPinLeft  10 int motorPinRight  11  int motorSpeedLeft  0 int motorSpeedRight  0  int fieldIndex  1 char values[2]    array holding values for the fields we expect  char newByte  0  void setup    pinModemotorPinLeft, OUTPUT   pinModemotorPinRight, OUTPUT   Serial.begin9600   whileSerial waits for arduino to be ready, not neaded for duo   establishContact   void loop     while Serial.availablegt0    checks to see if anything needs to be sent,                               denoted by recieveing signal from pySerial       char inByte  Serial.read        switch inByte                case 97           inByte  0           break          default            values[0]  inByte           could just call Serial.read and asign 2nd byte, but loop allows to send more variables later           if fieldIndex lt 2                        newByte  Serial.read             values[fieldIndex]  newByte             fieldIndex                       else                        Serial.printvalues[0], DEC    debugging purposes              Serial.printvalues[1], DEC              motorSpeedLeft  values[0]             motorSpeedRight  values[1]              Serial.printmotorSpeedLeft             Serial.printmotorSpeedRight              analogWritemotorPinLeft, motorSpeedLeft             analogWritemotorPinRight, motorSpeedRight               delay3000       to make the motor vibrate for 1 second              motorSpeedRight  0             motorSpeedLeft  0              analogWritemotorPinLeft, motorSpeedLeft             analogWritemotorPinRight, motorSpeedRight              delay1000                          Serial.printA         allows arduino to be ready before pySerial sends any messages void establishContact    while Serial.availablelt0         Serial.printA     delay300     codepre  pOutputp  precodebytearraybxb2x00 bA b0Kxfe bx13j10kxfe bx13j10kxfe codepre  pMy motor is running each time a print statement occurs, so I am not sure if it is just my print statements that are messing up, rather than the actual serial communicationp  pOne additional thing I am unsure of, is in my switchcase statement in the arduino code, I am using the ascii code for a 97 instead of actually putting a.

Negative 6159 pWhen you draw a freehand line with any paint application with whatever brush it ends up stacking together multiple points of that brush to form a brush stroke.p  pFor example a basic pen stroke would stack up 1 pixel as you drag the mouse. In more advanced applications you have a brush which is just a fancy Shape, say a star for example, and stroking the canvas with the star brush would just cause the paint application to draw multiple stars as you drag your mouse over the canvas. Please correct me if Im wrong.p  pI already have implemented the brush  i.e. a basic circle  and whenever the user drags their mouse over the canvas while holding the leftmousebutton the application draws a circle for each new mouse position.p  pMy problem is the undo feature if you may call it this way.p  pWhen I undo an action, my application only deletes the last Shape  circle  drawn, while I want it to delete the whole freehand drawing  collection of Shapes  circles  from the user first press of the leftmousebutton to the release.p  pHow do I pack a collection a Shape objects into one  A problem is also the repainting of all those circles, I want the repainting of maybe 30000 circles to be fast, just like a BufferedImage.p  pI already use a BufferedImage as the background of my image.p  pEvery Shape that is older than 50 gets permanently stored in the BufferedImage background.p  pCurrently I store the last 50 Shape objects in an ArrayList and the 51st  the oldest  gets permanently stored in the BufferedImage.

Negative 6159 pI am developing a mobile based shopping app. What the app does is, user deposits money in his account and spend it later. Race condition is one of the problem I am trying to avoid. such that user account balance wont be miscalculated.p  pI am using mysql 5.5, php.p  pHere is what I have come up.p  pcode create table orders    orderid int,   userid int,   title varchar,   itemprice decimal,   isactive int default null,   constraint primary key orderid,   constraint unq unique userid, isactive  codep  pThe idea is to set unique constraint on userid and isactive so that only one active orderdeposit money or use balance can be processed. active order will have codeisactivecode set to 1. codeisactivecode is updated to a timestamp so the unique constraint will be satisfied once the order is completed. Deposit money is similar logic.p  pHere is the pseudo code for purchase item with account balancep  precodeif  user has enough balance,   start transaction   insert into order with userid, orderid, isactive1   update user balance  balance  itemprice where balance gt itemprice   commit  if transaction success,   update order set isactive currenttimestamp where userid, orderid codepre  pIs there any problem with this logic p  pOr the race condition can be avoided without the unique constraint with this line    codeupdate user balance  balance  itemprice where balance gt itempricecodep  pstrongUPDATE 1strongp  pI have missed a case that will make things more complicated. Here is the detailp  pUser can choose to pay the remaining via an external payment service when an item price is greater than his account balance. p  precode first http request try to cancel any previous active external payment by the same user if user has enough balance,     get a secure token from external payment service     insert into order with userid, orderid, isactive1   second http request user paid and external payment service notifies my backend about the success payment. Then      start transaction     update user balance  balance  balancepayamount where balance gt balancepayamount     update order set isactive currenttimestamp where userid, orderid     commit codepre  pSince the payment and account balance update happen in a span of requests. transaction along wont work here. p  pSo I choose to cancel any previous active order paid via external service by the same user before creating another active order. This will have a side effect of slowing down user who submit many orders without pay in a short period of time. This serves as additional cleanup in case any existing abandoned active order prevent user making new order.p  pcodeisactivecode is the safeguard to prevent race condition from happening.p

Negative 6159 pIm in the middle of looking into a new repository to be used within my company. We currently use IVY and although this is pretty quickly using our own local repository, the only downside is that we use ANT for build scripts and its just ugly Id like to bring this side of things up to date a little and possibly use something like GRADLE although Ive heard its slow but Im a little lost with the options.p  pIdeally, Id like a repository which will be local as we have a number of internal jar files which cannot be shared. If there are dependencies which are available in public repos such as Maven, go off and download them and then even, if its possible, install them in the local repository. p  pAny one got any suggestions would be greatly appreciatedp

Negative 6159 pAs I am reading some CQRS resources, there is a recurrent point I do not catch. For instance, lets say a client emits a command. This command is integrated by the domain, so it can refresh its domain model DM. On the other hand, the command is persisted in an EventStore. That is the most common scenario.p  p1 When we say the DM is refreshed, I suppose data is persisted in the underlying database if any. Am I right  Otherwise, we would deal with a memorytransient model, which I suppose, would not be a good thing  state is not supposed to remain in memory on server side outside a client request.p  p2 If data is persisted, I suppose the readmodel that relies on it is automatically updated, as each client that requests it generates a new statecontext in the application in case of a WebApplication or a RESTful architecture p  p3 If the command is persisted, does that mean we deal with EventSourcing by construct when we use CQRS  Does EventSourcing invalidate the database update process  as if state is reconstructed from the EventStore, maintaining the database seems useless p  pstrongDoes CQRS only apply to multidatabases systems when data is propagated on separate databases, and, if it deals with memorytransient models, does that fit well with WebApplications or RESTful services strongp

Negative 6159 pFirst of all, since this is my first questionpost, I would like to strongthank you allstrong for this great community, and amazing service, as  like many developers around the world  stackoverflow  is my main resource when it comes to code issues.p  h2Notice h2  pThis post is a bit long sorry, covers two different  but related  aspects of the situation, and is organised as follows p  ol liBackground  Contextli liA design issue, on which i would like to receive your advice.li liThe solution Im trying to implement to solve 2.li liThe actual issue, and question, related to 3.li ol  h1 1. Some context h1  pI have two different codeModelcode objects codeReportcode and codeJobscode from an existing implementation that has a poor design. Fact is that both objects are quite similar in purpose, but were probably implemented in two different time frames.p  pA lot of processing happen on these objects, and since the the system has to evolve, I started to write a metaclassinterface, from which both will be subclasses. Currently both codeModelscode use different codeFieldscode names for same purpose, like codeauthorcode and codejusercode to denote codeUsercode which is very stupid and so on.br p  pSince I cannot afford to just change the columns names in the database, and then go through thousands of lines of code to change every references to these fields even though I could, thanks to emFind Usagesem feature of  modern IDEs, and also because theses object might be used somewhere else, I used the codedbcolumncode feat. to be able in each model to have the same field name and ultimately handle both object alike instead of having thousands of line of duplicated code to do the same stuff.p  pSo, I have something like that p  precodefrom django.db import models class ReportRunnable     name  models.CharFieldmaxlength55, dbcolumnname     description  models.CharFieldmaxlength350, blankTrue, dbcolumndescription     author  ForeignKeyUser, dbcolumnauthorid      and so on  class JobsRunnable     name  models.CharFieldmaxlength55, dbcolumnjname     description  models.CharFieldmaxlength4900, blankTrue, dbcolumnjdetails     author  ForeignKeyUser, dbcolumnjuserid      and so on codepre  pAs i said earlier, to avoid rewriting objects client code, I used properties that shadows the fields p  precodefrom django.db import models class Runnablemodels.Model        objects  managers.WorkersManager  The default manager.      property  Report     def typeself         return self.type      type.setter  Report     def typeself, value         self.type  value       for backward compatibility, TODO remove both     property  Jobs     def scriptself         return self.type      script.setter  Jobs     def scriptself, value         self.type  value      and so on codepre  pbr p  h12. The design issue h1  pThis is nice and its kind of what I wanted, except now using codeReport.objects.filternamesomethingcode or codeJobs.objects.filterjnamesomethingcode wont work, obviously due to Django design and so on with code.getcode, code.excludecode etc..., and the client code is sadly emfullem of those.br  Im of course planning to replace them all with methods of my newly created codeWorkersManagercodep  blockquote   pstrongApart strongbr   Wait ... what  emnewly createdem codeWorkersManagercode br    Yes, after two years and thousands of line of code, there was no codeManagercode in here, crazy right br But guess what  thats the least of my concerns and cheer up, since most of the code still lies in view.py and assosiated files instead of being properly inside the objects it is suposed to manipulate, basicaly somewhat pure emimperative pythonem...br    br Great right p blockquote  pbr p  h1 3. My solution h1  pAfter a lot of reading here and there and research about that, I found out that p  ol liTrying to subclass codeFieldcode, was not a solutionli liI could actually overload codeQuerySetcode.li ol  pSo I did p  precodefrom django.db.models.queryutils import Q as originalQ class WorkersManagermodels.Manager        def getquerysetself         class QuerySetoriginalQS                          Overloads original QuerySet class                          translate  translate  an external fonction that changes the name of the keys in kwargs              def filterself, args, kwargs                 args, kwargs  self.translateargs, kwargs                 superQuerySet, self.filterargs, kwargs               and many more others [...]         return QuerySetself.model, usingself.db codepre  pAnd this is quite fine. br p  h1 4. So whats wrong h1  pThe problem is that Django internally uses codeQcode inside db.model.query, using its own imports, and nowhere  codeQcode is exposed or referenced, so it could be overloaded.p  precodegtgtgt a Report.objects.filternamesomething Traceback most recent call last   File ltinputgt, line 1, in ltmodulegt   File venvlocallibpython2.7sitepackagesdjangodbmodelsmanager.py, line 143, in filter     return self.getqueryset.filterargs, kwargs   File venvlocallibpython2.7sitepackagesdjangodbmodelsquery.py, line 624, in filter     return self.filterorexcludeFalse, args, kwargs   File venvlocallibpython2.7sitepackagesdjangodbmodelsquery.py, line 642, in filterorexclude     clone.query.addqQargs, kwargs   File venvlocallibpython2.7sitepackagesdjangodbmodelssqlquery.py, line 1250, in addq     canreuseusedaliases, forcehavingforcehaving   File venvlocallibpython2.7sitepackagesdjangodbmodelssqlquery.py, line 1122, in addfilter     processextrasprocessextras   File venvlocallibpython2.7sitepackagesdjangodbmodelssqlquery.py, line 1316, in setupjoins     Choices are s  name, , .joinnames FieldError Cannot resolve keyword name into field. Choices are author, description, name,  and many more codepre  pBut I do remember reading something about how Django only loads the first occurrence of a codeModelcode, and how you could trick it by redefining such a codeModelcode before using import well obviously this doesnt apply to pythonbr So ultimately I tried to overload codeQcode, by redefining it before importing relevant class, or after, but I cannot possibly figure it out.p  pHere is what I tried p  precodefrom django.db.models.queryutils import Q as originalQ  translation  name name,  has much more, just for exemple  def translateargs, kwargs     for key in kwargs         if key in translation.keys             kwargs[translation[key]]  kwargs[key]             del kwargs[key]     return args, kwargs  class QoriginalQ          Overloads original Q class          def initself, args, kwargs         superQ, self.inittranslateargs, kwargs   now import QuerySet which should use the new Q class from django.db.models.query import QuerySet as originalQS  class QuerySetoriginalQS          Overloads original QuerySet class          translate  translate  writing shortcut      def filterself, args, kwargs         args, kwargs  self.translateargs, kwargs         superQuerySet, self.filterargs, kwargs      and some others   now import QuerySet which should use the new QuerySet class from django.db import models  class WorkersManagermodels.Manager     def getquerysetself          might not even be required if above code was successful         return QuerySetself.model, usingself.db codepre  pThis of course has no effect, as Q gets reimported from codedjango.db.model.querycode in the definition of codefilterorexcludecode.br  So of course, an intuitive solution would be to overload codefilterorexcludecode, and copy its original code without calling the codesupercodebr But here is the catch  Im using an old version of Django, that might be updated someday, and I dont want to mess with Django implementation specifics, as I already did with codegetquerysetcode, but I guess this is kind of ok since its as far as I understand a placeholder for overloading, and it was also the only way.Br br p  pSo here I am, and my question is  br  emIs there no other way to do it  is there no way for me to overload codeQcode inside of a Django module embr p  h3Thank you very much for reading all the way h3  phere is a potato Oups, wrong website, sorry  p  h1EDIT h1  pSo, after trying to overload codefilterorexcludecode, it seems that it has no effect.br  Im probably missing something about the call stack order or something alike...

This is so I can reuse the dropdown menu in other places. But I cant access this class for one or both of two reasonsp  p1] Its added dynamically so my jquery to add the class to it has finished running on page load. I cant use code.selected.onclick, functioneventcode as I am not clicking selected, rather I am clicking clickAnchor, so I am unsure how to access selected this way.p  p2] Following from above, when I have tried codeclickAnchor.onclick, functioneventcodenothing is happening either  is this because the new div is created as a direct child of codeltbodygtcode, rather than as a child of menu In other words is it something to do with the scope of the click event Probably completely wrong here.p

Negative 6159 pIn NUMA architecture Nonuniform memory access each processor has its own first level cache, so theres a protocol MESI for processor communication.

Negative 6159 pI have a web site in which Id like to have a user system where the user is emlogged inem no matter where he is on the web site.p  pUsing socket.io, I found that each HTML page requires its own socket.io connection. So every time a user leaves one HTML page for another, he will disconnect the first socket and connect the other.p  pWhat is the best way to preserve such a connection I dont want the user to manually log in on every HTML page. Id assume that passing the login data as HTML parameters and automatically log in to the server with those parameters is extremely dumb, but currently it is the only solution I can think of.p  pIdeally, socket.io would use the same socket on the entire site.p  pI assume that Im missing something though, considering that all websites with a user system has the desired functionality.p

Negative 6159 pIve written a web application which uses Facebook as the main way to authenticate users and collect information. On the home page, there is one button Sign in with Facebook, which allows users to sign in to the app.p  pIs there any way to restrict which users can use the Facebook app, and thus log into my web app, or do I have to handle this separatelymanually My first idea was to add them as test users, because my app is still in beta phase, and thus not publicly accessible.

Negative 6159 pFirst, let me list a few facts.p  ul liI use a database that exports reports to separate instances of Excel 2007 amp 32 bit Windowsli liFourteen of these reports need to be moved to the same workbook to create a reconciliation report for each organisation every month closer to 20 at year endli liThere are 30 organisations that this is done for each month.li liI have no control over how the database outputs the reports Im stuck with what Ive gotli ul  pUsing ForEachLoops answer in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2971473canvbareachacrossinstancesofexcelthis thread on Stack Overflowa I devised a VBA macro that can pull together the reports into one workbook which resides in the same instance as my macro Ill call this instance1 simply by using copy and paste. Using this loop in ForEachLoops code p  precodeFor Each myWorksheet In objApp.Workbooks1.Worksheets     Debug.Print       amp myWorksheet.Name     DoEvents Next codepre  pI store the details of a report into a type called SheetIDp  precodeType SheetID     wbName As String     wsName As String     Object As Object     App As Excel.Application End Type codepre  pSo when ForEachLoops code finishes, I have an array of type SheetID that contains all the relevant details of each report which I simply need to loop through to perform any actions.p  pActions my code performs include Copy the sheet from the instance it resides in Paste the sheet into a new sheet in a workbook in instance1 Delete the sheet that I just copied from If no more sheets exist in the Workbook I just copied from, then close the workbook if no more workbooks exist in the instance I just copied from then quit the instance.p  pSo far, so good.p  pOK, so heres my issue. It seems that Excel forgets which instance is instance1. This doesnt happen until I close instance1 for the first time after I run the macro. So I could open the workbook in the morning, leave it open and be able to use it and any other workbooks all day with no issues with how Excel operates.p  pHowever, once I close instance1 and try to use Excel again, it starts throwing up errors. If I open a document from another application such as Outlook, or Windows Explorer I get Excel encountered a problem and must restart. The problem with this is that when it restarts it goes into document recovery mode and so changes the status of the document I was trying to open.p  pFor instance, when you open an Excel attachment from an email within the preview window so without opening the email in its own window first Excel defaults to read only for that document. If you open the email first and launch the attachment, Excel opens it as readwrite. This is normal behaviour. In the scenario above though, when Excel crashes upon its first attempt to open the attachment and restarts and then opens the attachment, its not opening the readwrite copy i was trying to open. So I never get the document as readwrite. The same happens when I open a document from HP TRIM a document management system, Excel crashes and releases control of the file while it is restarting, the operating system reports the file is no longer in use to TRIM and TRIM checks it back in again. The only way to remedy this is to do a full system restart.p  pEDIT ADDITIONAL PARAGRAPH The reason why I am saying Excel seems to forget which instance is the original is because when instance1 opens normally, any addins install properly, I have access to my personal macro workbook, and so on. When the other instances are started by the Database exports, those resources are not present which is as I would expect as they are already being used by instance1. After Excel crashes, those resources behave as they do in the export instances even when there are no other instances running. In fact when I try and run a macro in my Personal Macro Workbook from a Quick Access Toolbar Button, Excel warns me that the PERSONAL.XLSB is already in use and do I want to open a readonly copy.p  pI suspect its something to do with objects not being killed properly but my understanding is that an object only exists as long as the original reference to it exists and so certainly shouldnt exist after instance1 is closed.p  pThis leads me to the functions that are declared at the top of ForEachLoops code.p  precodeDeclare Function FindWindowEx Lib User32 Alias FindWindowExA ByVal hWnd1 As Long, ByVal hWnd2 As Long, ByVal lpsz1 As String, ByVal lpsz2 As String As Long Declare Function GetClassName Lib User32 Alias GetClassNameA ByVal hWnd As Long, ByVal lpClassName As String, ByVal nMaxCount As Long As Long Declare Function IIDFromString Lib ole32 ByVal lpsz As Long, ByRef lpiid As UUID As Long Declare Function AccessibleObjectFromWindow Lib oleacc ByVal hWnd As Long, ByVal dwId As Long, ByRef riid As UUID, ByRef ppvObject As Object As Long codepre  pI really have no idea how they work or if theres any housekeeping my code should do when I quit instance1.p  pI would appreciate somebody analysing ForEachLoops code on the link above to see if they can spot any issues with it or give me some pointers as to how I should best handle this. I had a vaguely similar issue with an Excel addin I created that uses a XRibbonUI object occasionally excel would lose the pointer to the ribbon. This was solved by saving the ribbon pointer to a worksheet and then using CopyMemory to get it back into Excel once it was lost. Could something like this be used herep  pMany thanks to anyone who can help me with this.p
