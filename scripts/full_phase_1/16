If the user doesnt select a valid option, the menu should ask again keep asking until a valid option is selected.  If the user does select a valid option, your code should call a function to perform that task.  Note Your code should use functions to encapsulate parts of your solution. At the bare minimum, the main menu and each option from the main menu except Exit, should each be handled in its own function. When the called function is complete, make sure to prompt the customer with the main menu again. Order If the user selects Order, a second menu should appear with the following doughnutsp  pStrawberry Twizzler Chocolatedipped Maple Puff Vanilla Chai Strudel HoneyDrizzled Lemon Dutchie Done Selecting any of these options other than Done should prompt the user for how many they would like. You should make sure the user enters a valid amount hint use isdigit. If the user selects Done, return to the main menu. All other invalid inputs should simply repeat the menu. Note youll need these values later in checkout so make use of multiple returns in python.  If a user enters order a second time, you can have the new order replace the old one i.e., treat it like it was the first order. Check out If the user selects Check out from the main menu, they should be shown a list of how many of each type of doughnut they have ordered. Prompt the user to confirm or cancel their order. If they cancel return to the main menu. If they confirm, show them the total cost of their order. Each doughnut costs a different amount as followsp  pStrawberry Twizzler 2.00 each Chocolatedipped Maple Puff 3.25 each Vanilla Chai Strudel 2.75 each HoneyDrizzled Lemon Dutchie 2.50 each So, if the user ordered 3 Strawberry Twizzlers, 2 Chocolatedipped Maple Puffs, and 1 HoneyDrizzled Lemon Dutchie, their total would be 32.0023.2502.7512.50  15.00 This value should be printed out in a neatly formatted manner with exactly 2 decimal places in the total. E.g., Your total comes to 15.00. That users order should be cleared so that the next user can begin. Remember to thank the user for their business before returning to the main menu. Start Over or Exit If the user selects Start over from the main menu, their current order should be cleared. If the user selects Exit from the main menu, the program should end.p  pFor an idea of how to structure your code click here. Plan ahead in comments and build small parts at a time. Do not assume the user will enter correct input, marks will be alotted to each input above for input checking.p

Negative 16 pI think I might have found a bug, but Im not really sure. It could be  a syntax error on my part, but the compiler isnt catching. Anyway,  here is what Im trying to do. Basically Ive written my own  repository class that essentially just wraps the Fluent Repository  class. So here is the relevant code p  precodePublic Class GenericRepositoryOf T As IHasIntId      Private fluentRepos As FluentNHibernate.Framework.IRepository      Public Sub NewByVal FluentRepository As  FluentNHibernate.Framework.IRepository          fluentRepos  FluentRepository      End Sub      Private Sub New      End Sub      Public Function GetByIdByVal Id As Integer As T          Return QueryFunctionx As T x.Id  Id.FirstOrDefault      End Function      Public Function QueryByVal w As ExpressionOf System.FuncOf T,  Boolean As IListOf T          Return fluentRepos.QueryOf Tw.ToList      End Function  End Class codepre  pThen I wrote two unit tests, one that would pass in an  InMemoryRepository and one that would use an actual NHibernate session  to hit the real database.  here they are p  precode ltTestMethodgt Public Sub InMemoryTest          Dim inmemRepos As New InMemoryRepository          Dim p As New Product          Dim id As Integer  5          p.Id  id          p.Title  my product          inmemRepos.Savep          Dim genRepos As New GenericRepositoryOf ProductinmemRepos          Dim foundP  genRepos.GetByIdid          Assert.AreEqualp.Title, foundP.Title      End Sub      ltTestMethodgt Public Sub DatabaseTest          Dim session  NHibernateSessionManager.Instance.GetSession          Dim flRepos As New Repositorysession          Dim genRepos As New GenericRepositoryOf ProductflRepos          Dim id As Integer  1          Dim p  genRepos.GetByIdid          Assert.IsNotNullp          Assert.AreEqualid, p.Id      End Sub codepre  pThe InMemoryTest passed, and the DatabaseTest failed. The exception  from the DatabaseTest was a type conversion, from int to product or  maybe the other way around. I was able to fix it though. In the  Fluent NHibernate code I changed the Query method on the Repository  class from p  precodereturn session.LinqltTgt.Wherewhere.ToArray codepre  pto p  precodereturn session.LinqltTgt.Wherewhere.Compile.ToArray codepre  pNow both tests pass. All of the unit tests in the Fluent NHibernate  project pass either way.p

Negative 16 pIm using a HttpModule to rewrite the urls on a multilingual site. In the HttpModule, Im adding a handler for the BeginRequest event, and looking for the first part of the path which contains the culture name.p  pFor example, frcaindex.aspx will be rewritten to index.aspx and set the threads culture and ui culture to 3084. This works fine.p  pEnter forms authentication. Forms authentication still works fine with the unmapped url, but if the user is unauthorized, it will redirect to the loginUrl as set in the authentication section of the web.config, and include the ReturnUrl querystring parameter to handle redirecting back to the requested page once the user is authenticated.p  pThere are two problems here if the user requests a page in a language other than the defaultp  ol liThe loginUrl ignores the path before its rewrittenli liThe ReturnUrl parameter also ignored the raw path.li ol  pIts equivalent to Request.Url.PathAndQuery instead of Request.RawUrl.p  pI cant jump into the pipeline at the AuthorizeRequest event instead because then Id have to protect against all possible culture values, because Im using one web.config file with multiple location paths. This also doesnt fix the first issue.p  pIve gone through the FormsAuthenticationModule in reflector and I see where I could change it to solve 1 and 2, but its of course sealed.p  pIve also browsed around a lot, but I cant see any workable solutions.p  pThe FormsAuthenticationModule is checking for a 401 header thats generated in UrlAuthorizationModule. If you look for the referrer which is empty on the loginUrl page it confirms that.p  pAny thoughtsp  pstrongEDIT 1strongp  pIm using IIS 6, and IIS 7 is not an option.p  pstrongEDIT 2strongp  pThe login page wasnt picking up the default cultureui culture because when I generated the local resource design view Tools  Generate Local Resource, the IDE added the following to the page directivep  pcultureauto metaresourcekeyPageResource1 uicultureautop  pBe careful with this in vs.net 2008 At least this solves one of the problems with the default culture not being referenced, but 1 and 2 are still outstanding.p  pstrongEDIT 3strongp  pI hoped that I could jump into one of the pipeline events to do my own redirect, but in Reflecting the System.Web.Security.UrlAuthorizationModule OnEnter method, I learned that once the 401 header is set, the method calls application.CompleteRequest, which as you can guess, brings us right to the EndRequest event. This is what the FA module jumps into the do the redirect, and Im afraid I cant jump in front to do my own redirect Im surprised there arent more people coming across this issue, or perhaps they havent chimed in yet.p  phr p  pExamplep  pI have a members section in the physical folder members thats protected by forms authentication.p  pIn the web.config, I havep  precodeltauthentication modeFormsgt   ltforms loginUrlmemberslogin.aspx timeout40 gt ltauthenticationgt codepre  pand...p  precode  ltlocation pathmembersgt       ltsystem.webgt       ltauthorizationgt       ltdeny users gt       ltallow rolesMembers gt       ltdeny users gt       ltauthorizationgt       ltsystem.webgt   ltlocationgt codepre  pWhen an unauthenticated user requests the index page of members, they get redirected to the loginUrl from the authentication section above by the FormsAuthenticationModule. It also appends the ReturnUrl parameter with the requested page.p  pThis works just fine if a user is browsing the website using the default culture, but my HttpModule sets the culture based on the presence of a culture name in the first part of the path.p  pSo, frcamembersindex.aspx gets rewritten to membersindex.aspx and sets the cultureui culture to Canadian French. Unforunately, the FormsAuthenticationModule sends the user to the loginUrl page with the rewritten url, not the original. So, the culture setting is lost and the redirect url is incorrect.p  pHope that helps Gregp

Negative 16 pIm having some trouble representing an object hierarchy in Hibernate.  Ive searched around, and havent managed to find any examples doing this or similar  you have my apologies if this is a common question.p  pI have two types which Id like to persist using Hibernate Groups and Items.br  Groups are identified uniquely by a combination of their name and their parent.br  The groups are arranged in a number of trees, such that every Group has zero or one parent Group.br  Each Item can be a member of zero or more Groups.  p  pIdeally, Id like a bidirectional relationship allowing me to getbr  all Groups that an Item is a member ofbr  all Items that are a member of a particular Group or its descendants.br I also need to be able to traverse the Group tree from the top in order to display it on the UI.p  pThe basic object structure would ideally look like thisp  precodeclass Group      ...      return all items in this group and its descendants      SetltItemgt getAllItems  ...        return all direct children of this group      SetltGroupgt getChildren  ...      ...   class Item      ...      return all groups that this Item is a direct member of      SetltGroupgt getGroups  ...        ...  codepre  pOriginally, I had just made a simple bidirectional manytomany relationship between Items and Groups, such that fetching all items in a group hierarchy required recursion down the tree, and fetching groups for an Item was a simple getter, i.e.p  precodeclass Group      ...     private SetltItemgt items     private SetltGroupgt children     ...      return all items in this group and its descendants      SetltItemgt getAllItems          SetltItemgt allItems  new HashSetltItemgt         allItems.addAllthis.items         forGroup child  this.getChildren              allItems.addAllchild.getAllItems                  return allItems            return all direct children of this group      SetltGroupgt getChildren          return this.children          ...   class Item      ...     private SetltGroupgt groups      return all groups that this Item is a direct member of      SetltGroupgt getGroups          return this.groups          ...  codepre  pHowever, this resulted in multiple database requests to fetch the Items in a Group with many descendants, or for retrieving the entire Group tree to display in the UI.  This seems very inefficient, especially with deeper, larger group trees. Is there a better or standard way of representing this relationship in Hibernatep  pAm I doing anything obviously wrong or stupid  p  hr   pMy only other thought so far was this Replace the groups id, parent and name fields with a unique path String which specifies the whole ancestry of a group, e.g.br rootGroupbr rootGroupaChildbr rootGroupaChildaGrandChild  p  pThe join table between Groups and Items would then contain grouppath and itemid.p  pThis immediately solves the two issues I was suffering previouslybr 1. The entire group hierarchy can be fetched from the database in a single query and reconstructed inmemory.br 2. To retrieve all Items in a group or its descendants, we can select from groupitem where grouppathN or grouppath like N  p  pHowever, this seems to defeat the point of using Hibernate.  All thoughts welcomep

Negative 16 pI have a database containing orders and each order has an associated location. Currentl, when a user is logged in ,I am using Bing Maps API to geocode each order location and then compute driving distance to the logged in user. Based on these distances, the user via a dropdownbox can then specify the maximal distances with the results displayed in a gridview. However, with more than 100 orders the process becomes painfully slow. I would appreciate some tips on optimizing either the bing queries, possibly caching the resultsso they can be reused without reaccessing the bing maps api or utilizing Ajax to somehow background process the orders. Thanks.p

Negative 16 pIm currently working my way through Andrew Appels Modern Compiler Implementation in Java, and Im right around the point where I build the lowlevel intermediate representation.p  pInitially, I had decided to target the JVM and ignore all of the lowlevel machine stuff, but in the interest of learning things that I dont know much about Ive had a change of heart.  This changes my IR, because targeting the JVM allows me to more or less wave my hands at making a method call or constructing an object.p  pThe Appel book doesnt go into detail about any specific machine architecture, so Id like to know where I can find out everything I need to know to go farther.p  pThe things that Im currently aware that I need to know arep  ul lipWhich instruction set to use.  I have two laptops I could develop on both have Core 2 Duo processors.  My current understanding is that x86 processors mostly use the same instruction set, but they are not all exactly the same.  pli lipWhether the operating system affects the code generation step of compilation, or whether it is completely dependent on the processor.  For example, I know something is different about generating code to run on a 32bit vs. a 64bit platform.pli lipHow stack frames and such are organized.  When to use registers vs. putting parameters on the stack, callersave vs. calleesave, all of that.  Id have thought that this would be described along with the instruction set but so far I havent seen this particular info anywhere.  Maybe Im misunderstanding something herepli ul  pLinks to resources in lieu of answers are perfectly welcomed.p

Negative 16 pjust wondering if anyone has any ideas about an issue Im having.p  pI have a fair amount of data that needs to be displayed on one graph. Two theoretical lines that are bold and solid are displayed on top, then 10 experimental data sets that converge to these lines are graphed, each using a different identifier eg the  or o or a square etc. These graphs are on a log scale that goes up to 1e6. The first few decades of the graph lt 1e3 look fine, but as all the datasets converge  1e3 its really difficult to see what data is what. p  pTheres over 1000 data points points per decade which I can prune linearly to an extent, but if I do this too much the lower end of the graph will suffer in resolution. p  pWhat Id like to do is prune logarithmically, strongest at the high end, working back to 0. My question is stronghow can I get a logarithmically scaled index vector rather than a linear onestrongp  pMy initial assumption was that as my data is lenear I could just use a linear index to prune, which lead to something like this but for all decadesp  precodegrab indicies per decade ind12  findy gt 1e1 amp y lt 1e2 indlow  findy lt 1e2 indhigh  findy gt 1e4 ind23  findy gt 1e2 amp y lt 1e3 ind34  findy gt 1e3 amp y lt 1e4  We want ind12 indexes in this decade, find spacing tot23  roundlengthind23lengthind12 tot34  roundlengthind34lengthind12  grab ones to keep ind23keep  ind231tot23ind23end ind34keep  ind341tot34ind34end  indnew  [indlow ind23keep ind34keep indhigh]  loglogxindnew, yindnew codepre  pBut this causes the prune to behave in a jumpy fashion obviously. Each decade has the number of points that Id like, but as its a linear distribution, the points tend to be clumped at the high end of the decade on the log scale. p  pAny ideas on how I can do thisp

The four arguments correspond to the four sides of a puzzle piece up, down, left, right. If the argument is true, it means that protrusion should stick out of that side of puzzle piece. If its false, it should have a hole on that side, so it fits the protrusion.br I first attach the protrusions that stick out, then i flip the protrusions that stick in, attach them to a new sprite inpart and invert them with the following functionp  precodeinpartinvertSpriteinpart,inpart.widht,inpart.height function invertSpritesourceSprite, width int, height int  var childShape  new Shape  child.graphics.beginFill0xFFFFFF child.graphics.lineStyle child.graphics.drawRect0, 0, width,height child.graphics.endFill  var contSprite  new Sprite cont.addChildchild cont.addChildsource source.blendMode  BlendMode.ERASE cont.blendMode  BlendMode.LAYER return cont  codepre  pI combine the two parts and the result is black and white puzzle piece.p  pI then want to apply the piece as a mask to a part of a loaded image.p  precodepuzzleImg  Bitmaploader.content.bitmapData  this is the .jpg image  var width  piece.width  piece is black and white Sprite in the shape of the puzzle  var height  piece.height  var puzzlePcBitmapData  new BitmapDatawidth,height,true,0 puzzlePc.drawpuzzleImg disp  new BitmappuzzlePc tmp.addChilddisp tmp is the main, holding Sprite addChildpiece disp.mask  piece disp.cacheAsBitmap  true piece.cacheAsBitmap  true tmp.mouseChildren  false codepre  pThis all works fine, except that the holes in the puzzle pieces transparent parts in which other puzzle pieces should fit respond to mouse clicks, and this is obviously not good for my intent.p  pIm trying to solve this for a couple of days now, but I dont really understand why this happens.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 16 pI need to serialize a color used in a WPF application to a database. Id like to use the sRGB values, because theyre more familiar to those of us that have spent the last few years doing web development.p  pHow can a get an ARGB string like FFFFFFFF from a System.Windows.Media.Color objectp  pstrongUPDATEstrong I was misled by the documentation on MSDN. As Kris noted below, the documentation for the codeToStringcode method is incorrect. Although it says that ToString creates a string representation of the color using the ScRGB channels, it will actually return a string in ARGB hex format if the color was created using the codeFromARGBcode method. Its an undocumented feature, I suppose. p  pSee a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms606572.aspxhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms606572.aspxa p

Negative 16 pJava newbie here. Are there any helper functions to serialize data in and out of byte arrays I am writing a Java package that implements a network protocol. So I have to write some typical variables like a version 1byte, sequence Number long and binary data bytes in a loop. How do I do this in Java Coming from C I am thinking of creating a byte array of the required size and then since there is no memcpy I am converting the long into a temporary byte array and then copying it into the actual byte array.  It seems so inefficient and also really error prone. Is there a class I could use to marshall and unmarshall parameters to a byte arrayp  pAlso why does all the Socket classes only deals with char[] and not byte[] A socket by definition has to deal with binary data also. How is this done in Java p  pI am sure what I am missing is the Java mindset. Appreciate it if some one can point it to me.p  pEDIT I did look at DataOutputStream and DataInputStream but I cannot convert the bytes to a String not to a byte[] which means the information might be lost in the conversion to write to a socket. p  ul liPavli ul

Negative 16 pI used bind all codeGridViewscode, codeDetailViewscode etc. on my page using an codeObjectDataSourcecode unless it wasnt possible to do so. Recently, Ive started binding all my contols programatically. I find this a lot cleaner and easier, though some may disagree. p  pBinding with a codeObjectDataSourcecode obviously has it advantages and disadvantages, as does doing it programatically.p  pSay I bind a GridView programatically e.g. codeGridView1.DataSource  SomeListcode, when I change page on the GridView, I have to also code this. Each time the page changes I have to call codeGridView1.DataSource  SomeListcode again. Obviously with a codeObjectDataSourcecode I dont need to do this. I normally stick my codeSomeListcode object into the ViewState so when I change page I dont need to hit the database each and every time.p  pMy question is Is this how the ObjectDataSource works Does it store its data in the ViewState and not hit the database again unless you call the code.Selectcode method I like to try and get the best performance out of my applications and hit the database as few times as possible but I dont really like the idea of storing a huge list in the ViewState. Is there a better way of doing this Is caching per user a good idea or possible Shall I just hit the database everytime instead of storing my huge list in the ViewState Is it sometimes better to hit the database than to use ViewStatep

Negative 16 pIm creating some maps from raster files using the raster package in R. Id like to create comparison rasters, showing several maps side by side. Its important for this that the colour scales used are the same for all maps, regardless of the values in each map. For example, if map 1 has values from 01, and map 2 has values from 00.5, cells with a value of 0.5 should have the same colour on both maps.p  pFor examplep  ul limap 1 has values from 0 to 1li limap 2 has values from 0 to 0.5li lithe colour goes from red lowest to green highestli ul  pI would like a value of 0.5 to have the same colour in both maps i.e. yellow, as halfway between red and green. The current behaviour is that it is yellow in map 1, and green in map 2.p  pI cant find a way to make this work. I cant see any way to set the range of pixel values to use with the plotting function. setMinMax doesnt help as plot always calculates the values. Even trying to set the values by hand e.g. g1datamax lt 10 doesnt work these are ignored when plotting.p  pFinally, making a stack of the maps which might be expected to plot everything on the same colour scale doesnt work either  each map still has its own colour scale.p  pAny thoughts on how to do thisp  pEDITp  pThe solution I ended up using isp  precodeplot d, colrev rainbow 99, start0,end1  , breaksseqminminValue d ,maxmaxValued,length.out100   codepre

The structure is roughly something like thisp  ul liapplication ol licontrollersli limodelsli liviewsli olli licacheli liframework li lipublic ol liassetsli liimgli licssli lijsli olli liindex.phpli li.htaccessli ul  pFor an URL like myapp.comcss I need o load the CSS controller, index function. But for URLs like myapp.comcssstyle.css I need to fetch the file from the publiccssdirectoryp  pId hate writing public for each file I want to include, so basically I need to redirect all traffic to public if its an actual file and keep the normal rewriting rule for all other URLs. Im planning to use this in production and it would be much easier to let frontend developers do their stuff the way they normally do it and then just copy paste stuff into place instread of going through CSS to modify paths and such. p  pI came up with thisp  precodeRewriteEngine on  RewriteRule imgcssjsassets..[az]3 public12 [L,NC]  RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME f RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME d RewriteRule . index.php1 [L,QSA] codepre  pBut it has some obvious flaws.

Negative 16 pTo avoid side effect  I dont want to change the pramaeter object attribute values, in my method. I prefer to create a new one that will represent the result and return it.p  pAvoiding side effect is only really important in multithread environment, but still good practice to have. fXY ,is good to be able to compare both objects, the one u received as argument and the one u giving as result.p  pThat means, I need to map all the attribute in my IN paramater object to my OUT new instance object created.

After some time narrowing down the issue, I was able to determine with 100 certainty, that it has to do with the Yahoo yui reset.css library.

Negative 16 pFirst, I want to say that I have a fully functional WCF service that uses many endpoints and service contracts with no problems whatsoever.p  pOk so here is my scenario.

I know exactly where the issue lies, and its the fact that this class is nested inside of another class. To fix this issue or really workaround it, I have been doing the following to my interface.p  precode[ServiceContractNamespacehttpMyNamesapce] public interface IDatabase       [OperationContract]     void GetDataDatabase.MyTable MyTableData  codepre  pThat resolves all issues and the client can generate metadata perfectly. I know I am missing out an understanding a very important piece of WCF here. I am more or less looking for answers to why specifying a Namespace on that service contract that references a nested class helps resolve my metadata generation issue, the answer should be obvious but I am blinded at the moment.p  pstrongEDIT 1strongp  pAlso, if I could get away with fixing this issue in the app.config I would love to. p

Negative 16 pThe application I develop is deployed to severeal environments development, test, staging, production.p  pWhile developing I created the entity model from the existing developmentdatabase. Everything works fine, but as I wanted to put the application onto the testenvironment, I realized the following problemp  pThe structure of the database is identical in all environments, but the database schema changes from environment to environment. For example theres a codeCustomerscode table in every database. On my local dev machine it has the schema dbo code[dbo].[Customers]code, but in the test environment the schema is test code[test].[Customers]code, whilst the schema is stag in the staging environment code[stag].[Customers]code and so forth.p  pSo when I deploy the application in the test environment, it gets no data from the database, because the entity framework expects the data to be found in code[dbo].[Customers]code but there is no such table, there is just a code[test].[Customers]code.p  pI know, that I can define a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9341922changeentityframeworkdatabaseschemamapafterusingcodefirstschema other than dboa, but this doesnt help me, because I need a different schema depending on the deployment environment.p  pAny suggestions Somehow I think Ill be ending up, asking my DB admin to change the schema to dbo in every database in each environment...p

Negative 16 pI am writing a program using OpenGL, but Ive come across a problem. I have a class called Quad and the two variables causing the problem are a public map and a public Vector3 which is another class. Here are those two variables defined in Quad.hp  precodestdmapltunsigned int, Vector3gt vertexes Vector3 normal codepre  pnormal is initiated I think thats the word in the Quad constructor, like thisp  precodenormal  new Vector30,0,0 codepre  pThe map is just added to like this p  precodevertexes[0]  ampvertex codepre  pcodevertexcode being a plain Vector3, and the map accepts pointers to Vector3s so I had to reference it like that.p  pI can print out the correct value of Vector3 through another function but for some reason I get a segmentation fault in thisp  precodevoid Quaddraw      glNormal3fnormalgtx, normalgty, normalgtz      for stdmapltunsigned int, Vector3gtiterator i  thisgtvertexes.begin i    thisgtvertexes.end i          glVertex3figtsecondgtx, igtsecondgty, igtsecondgtz       codepre  pI know its caused by the public variable because the fault would not happen if I comment out the contents of the method. codecout ltlt normalgtx ltlt endlcode also causes a fault, wheras codecout ltlt Hello World ltlt endlcode does not. But what is the difference between this function and thisp  precodevoid QuadcalculateNormal      Vector3 tmp  vertexes[0]     tmp  tmp.getFaceNormalvertexes[1], vertexes[2]     normal  amptmp     stdcout ltlt normal ltlt stdendl  codepre  pThis is where normal is redefined and printed.

My problem is that I can easily create submenus for About Us and Multimedia since I store those pages in the codepgPagescode table, but I need to create submenus for codeNewscode from the codeNews Categorycode table and link them to the proper page Handler. amp Issue from codemagazinecode table.p  pstrongMenus Examplestrong  img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comB6bMq.png altenter image description herep  pSample Datap  precodepgPages Table PageID  PageName    LangID  PagePositionNo  PageURL     PageInheritance 1   Home        1   10      Default.aspx    0 2   About Us    1   20      Page.aspx   0 3   PageOne     1   10      Page.aspx   2 4   PageTwo     1   20      Page.aspx   2 5   Multimedia  1   30      Page.aspx   0 6   Video       1   10      Videos.aspx 5 7   PhotoGallery    1   20      Gallery.aspx    5 8   News        1   40      News.aspx   0 9   Issues      1   50             0 10  Publication 1   60      Page.aspx   0 11  SpanishHome 2   10      Default.aspx    0 12  SpanisAbout Us  2   20      Page.aspx   0  Magazine MagazineID  MagazineIssueCode   LangID  MagazineTitle   MagazineLiveIssueCurrentIssue 1       101         1   Mag Title       0 2       102         1   Mag Title       1 3       101         2   SpanisgMag Title    0 4       102         2   Mag Title       1   artArticle Table ArticleID   ArticleTitle    ArticleCatID    MagazineID  Language   TYPE  1       Article one 100     1       1   Artile 2       Article two 100     1       1   Artile 3       Article three   200     1       1   Artile 4       Article four    300     1       1   Artile 5       Article Five    100     2       1   Artile 6       EditorMessage   300     2       1   EditorMessage 7       Article seven   200     2       2   Somthing  codepre  pI want my design to be flexible enough to read menus from different tables. What approachchanges should I takedo to get it done properly rather than creating a separate table for all the Menus amp link them to pages Please suggest the best approach for this scenario. p  pI want system to be very flexible and read menu information directly from the database rather than creating static links and firing queries based on codeIssueIDcode or some other ID.p  pcodeNews Menucode basically show categories of article, Further i need a query which will only show categories under codeNewscode menu which has articles for that particular issue. Suppose if issue 102 doesnt have any article related to strongemCultureemstrong then Culture submenu should not show up under news.p

Negative 16 pI have committed changes to Git and pushed to origin. Another developer was having trouble merging. They did something and did a push. I saw an update and did a pull and half my changes were reverted What happened Im guessing they had merge conflicts and used their version of the file but even so I cant find any history of my work in Git p  pIm using SourceTree and not quite comfortable with it yet. Ive just installed Smart Git more familiar with it but not finding anything useful to discover what happened in either. p

Negative 16 pMost questions regarding NodeJS, S3 and Zips are the opposite of what I would like to do. Upload a zip, and extract the files onto S3. p  pI have a quick app running on an Amazon EC2 instance, with Node.JS that accepts a file upload via a POST request. The aim is to upload a zip file full of images, extract them, and place each individual image on Amazon S3. p  pI am using express.js to accept the posted file, and I have been playing with AdmZip to read the uploaded zip file. With AdmZip, I can extract the zip file to the servers disk, then loop over each extracted image in a temporary directory and then send that to Amazon S3, but this seems very inefficient.  Ive read quite a bit about streaming files from S3 to Node and zipping it on the fly. I guess what I want to know is if this is possible in reverse.p

Negative 16 pThis is Android specific.p  pI derive all of my Activities in Android from a custom class that provides a nice, clean place to put common code used by all layouts in the application, especially some common setContentView override code that injects layouts into my layouts.  So here is what a typical hierarchy looks likep  precodeMyActivity extends MyBaseClass gt MyBaseClass extends Activity gt Activity codepre  pFor one of my apps, I needed Google Maps support.  So I tried to turn MyBaseClass into a templategeneric so that I could do something likep  precodeMyActivity extends MyBaseClassltMapActivitygt gt MyBaseClassltTgt extends T gt T codepre  pWhich, of course, failed to compile because Java templatesgenerics are not nearly as useful as C templates as I discovered shortly after the attempt.  So I ended up creating a whole separate class as a temporary workaroundp  precodeMyActivity extends MyBaseMapClass gt MyBaseMapClass extends MapActivity gt MapActivity codepre  pAnd copied all the code from MyBaseClass into MyBaseMapClass.  The code is identical except for a few minor changes involving imports.  It works, but it is hardly a good solution.p  pI crossed my fingers that the above would be the end of the problem and I would never have to revisit it again.p  pUnfortunately, Im starting to experiment with a fragment and activity mix with a much more complex base class and the problem of code duplication with the above is getting to be a serious issue.  Any time I make a change in one file, I have to remember to clone it to the other files and development is moving fast enough that Im quickly getting out of sync.p  pActivity, MapActivity, FragmentActivity, ListActivity, PreferenceActivity, etc.  Do I need to make a separate derived class for each and every one of those that I wish to use  I hope not and, for this reason, Ive already limited my derivations to begin with some of my activities dont have certain features as a result.  The problem is further exasperated by the fact I sometimes use two separate base classes where some activities need to inflate even more views into the layout but not all activities need to do sop  precodeMyActivity extends MyBaseClass gt MyBaseClass extends Activity gt Activity  MyActivity2 extends AnotherBaseClass gt AnotherBaseClass extends MyBaseClass gt MyBaseClass extends Activity gt Activity codepre  pIf I want to use the code for AnotherBaseClass in Maps, I not only have to create MyBaseMapClass, but also AnotherBaseMapClass and copy the code.  Im up to four classes at this point where two of the classes are a couple thousand lines of cloned code.  Replicated code bothers me because it makes maintenance and development that much harder to do.p  pDeriving Android classes introduces complexities such as findViewById being a part of the Activity base class.  Thats important because Im not sure how I would write an interface or composite without running into the same problems I just described.p  pAnyone here encountered this issue and come up with a workable solutionp

Negative 16 pIm creating some simple webpage with Spring MVC, Hibernate4 and MySQL5. One of models I use contains BLOB value byte[]. When I try to persist that model with codeentityManager.persistcode  I get MySQLSytnaxException. Actually there are more problems with current configuration, such as persistmergeremove ignoring Transactional annotation, but this one is the most critical.p  pI already tried using codesession.saveobjectcode or replacing byte[] by Blob. Still the same result. All working examples I found use completely diffirent approach  e.g. they use HibernateSessionManager and HibernateTransactionManager instead of JPA ones  and I would like to found solution that doesnt require complete change in how I persist entities, when Im still not sure that it would help.p  pCould You tell me what mistakes I made in codeconfigurationassumptionsp  pBeginning of a stack

Negative 16 pemDisclaimer  Im quite new to the language, so I apologize if Ive done something illogical or explain something incorrectly.  Im also new to StackOverflow...emp  pSo far, in Xcode ObjectiveC, Ive started an empty project and added a View Controller object with a Collection View object inside of it that contains a single Collection View Cell. That cell has Image View amp Label objects one of each. Ive added a Storyboard and ViewController.h  ViewController.m pair of files subclass of UIViewController.p  pInitially I started with an empty project template, but ran into problems and deleted the project folder and started over with a singleview template.p  pNow, whenever I use any CollectionView object in any project, I get an error from Xcode upon running it.

I did that in one of my prior projects though.p  pIf I add a second Collection View object, and tie it to the View Controller header file, as an outlet to a property named breadboxCollectionView then the application launches without throwing any exceptions. It doesnt display the second collection view object, but Im going to consider that an entirely different hurdle at this point. I need the reference to breadboxCollectionView to vanish.p  pI tried to delete the second Collection View object, but after running the application afterward boom, same error shows up.p  pI tried to delete the second Collection View object by doing these things in this order 1 delete outlet connection 2 delete the property entry in the view controller header file 3 delete the second collection view object.p  pIve removed and reinstalled Xcode.

Negative 16 pI have an iOS app that has a log in view codeLognnViewControllercode and once a user is successfully authenticated they are taken to another view codeDetailEntryViewControllercode to enter some simple details.br Once the details are entered the user is taken to the main part of the app that consists of a tab controller codeTabViewControllercode that holds a variety of other views.  The LogInViewController performs a modal segue to the codeDetailEntryViewControllercode and the codeDetailEntryViewControllercode then performs a modal segue to the TabViewController so I have kind of a modal segue chain going to get into the app.  When a user logs out I want to go all the way back to the LogInViewController but when I do ap  precode[self.presentingViewController dismissModalViewControllerAnimatedYES] codepre  p...it pops the TabViewController and I end up back at the codeDetailEntryViewControllercode instead of the first LogInViewController.

Negative 16 pI am working on a website providing the hotel booking service as well as tourism information. The question is that how to make rooms available after the period of their booking has expired ..... This is actually a website and Im writing it in ASP.NET and the code behind is C.NET. The backend used is SQL Server 2005. I just want to ask what could be the possible logic to make the room available after the customer that booked it checked out the hotel. I mean, this room is to be now made available for any other customer. Suppose, I booked room A on 112013 for three days. During these days, if any other customer wants to book this room, it should be locked and the customer should be prompted to book another room. So, in short, the room should be made available the day the customer checks out and also should be available to another customer.p

Negative 16 h1The Situationh1  pOkay, so heres the deal Ive set myself a challenge to improve my JavaScript knowledge. This challenge involves the creation of an entirely frontend Excellike spreadsheet. Currently what I have is a table with 15 columns and 30 rows of table cells which allow text input.

This isnt a great issue when there are only 9 cells available like in the crude example above, but my current table has 15 columns and 30 rows... 450 of themp  pI currently have it set up so that every time the browsers focus leaves a cell, the behind JavaScript loops through and updates each cell to ensure the data is all correct. This on its own causes a tiny bit of lag when there are only 5 or 6 cells with data in, so Im concerned that by the time I populate every cell in the spreadsheet my browser will die on me.p  pIm most likely dreaming the impossible, but ideally Id like to be able to present a spreadsheet with hundreds of columns and rows which update on the fly. So my two questions to you all arep  ul liWhat can I do to prevent lagli liWould it even be possible to support more than 15 columns and 30 rows of formulae without breaking the internet in the processli ul

Negative 16 pI would like to be able to convert a highvalued unsignedinteger a value that uses the highestorder bit to a signedinteger.  In this case, I dont care that the value is higher than the maximum value of the signed integer type.  I just want it to convert to whatever the bitvalues represent as a signedinteger.  In other words, I would expect it to result in a negative number.  p  pHowever, with VB.NET, the codeCTypecode operation doesnt work that way or any of the other conversion functions like codeCShortcode andcodeCIntegercode.  When you try to convert an unsigned value that is higher than the desired signedtypes maximum value, it throws an codeOverflowExceptioncode rather than returning a negative number.  For instancep  precodeDim x As UShort  UShort.MaxValue Dim y As Short  CShortx   Throws OverflowException codepre  pIts worth mentioning, too, that the codeDirectCastcode operation cannot be used to cast the value between the signed and unsigned types, since neither type inherits or implements the other.  For instancep  precodeDim x As UShort  UShort.MaxValue Dim y As Short  DirectCastx, Short   Wont compile Value of type UShort cannot be converted to Short codepre  pI have figured out one way to do what I want, but it seems unnecessarily ugly.  Heres how I got it to workp  precodeDim x As UShort  UShort.MaxValue Dim y As Short  BitConverter.ToInt16BitConverter.GetBytesx, 0   y gets set to 1 codepre  pLike I said, that works, but if theres an easier, cleaner way of doing it in VB.NET, Id love to know what it is.p

Negative 16 pThis question is for experienced architects  How do the big boys do it p  pstrongOverviewstrongp  pI am building this high traffic, analytics like solution based on .NET, it ultimately will hosted on Azure. Lets assume this web app will receive 500M transactions every day, and these are very quick hits to our servers, very little DB querying for each will be required, virtually all of the heavy lifting will be done on a server side on set intervals. I am pretty sure that I have to implement some sort of a queue that will store all of the incoming hits and implement aggregators on a backend that will run every minute or so to process new items from the queue.p  pstrongSuggested Solutionstrongp  pCorrect me if I am wrong but I am thinking writing these transactions straight to the database some sort of the log table would be a mistake, so I will be utilizing the Azure Storage Account Table for my queue and spin off couple of Azure Worker Roles based on need to process the data and update the database. Thoughtsp  pIts important to remember that Azure Storage is mostly based on a pertransation model, so I would have to pay for all incoming transations writes AND for the transactions for my aggregators reads. So 500M writes and 500M reads per day, which comes out to be around 100day. Does that make sense Also, with using Azure Storage can I read a block of rows to account for a single transaction or I would have to read the queue one record at the timep  pLastly, performing a DB insertupdate for each row would be an overkill for my aggregators, so I am thinking each one should probably aggregate the workload in memory and then purge it to the database. Thoughtsp  pAny help in pointing me in the right direction will be greatly appreciated  Thanksp

Thanksp  plt EDIT p  pThanks for all of the responses so far A popular suggestion has been to just call MsBuild.exe directly without using cmd.exe. The reason I need to go through cmd.exe is some projects dont build successfully if called directly from MsBuild.exe e.g. XNA projects. Instead I need to call MsBuild.exe from the Visual Studio Command Prompt so that I assume all of the required environmental variables are set. I guess I could just call the VS Command Prompt directly, but it will have the same problem as calling cmd.exe too. If I cant find the VS Command Prompt I fallback to calling MsBuild.exe directly, so those answers are still appreciated.p

Negative 16 pI am making a Windows Phone app and I am trying to get JSON data from a URL. The user needs to be logged into the website which hosts the JSON data in order to get JSON data and I cannot use the Web Browser control to display the data and then extract the string since the browser doesnt recognize it for some weird reason and asks to search for an app on Store which can handle that JSON file type. If I open the URL in desktop browser on my Windows PC, I can see the raw JSON data. I cant use normal HTTPWebRequest or WebClient as to get JSON data the login cookies needs to be set the JSON data is userspecific and I cant extract the cookies from Web browser control and use it with WebClient or HTTPWebRequest. So the best thing I can do is use a special internal instance of IWebRequestCreate that is used internally by the WebBrowser. By opening background HTTP requests with that class, the cookies get automatically set as if they were createdsent by the WebBrowser control. But my code is not returning the JSON data, I get blank response, as in the string strongrespstrong is empty. p  pBelow is the codep  precodeDim browser  New WebBrowser Dim brwhttp  GetTypeWebRequestCreator.GetPropertyBrowserHttp Dim requestFactory  TryCastbrwhttp.GetValueBrowser, Nothing, IWebRequestCreate Dim uri  New Urihttpapi.quora.comapiloggedinuserfieldsinbox,notifs,following,followers Dim req  requestFactory.Createuri req.Method  GET req.BeginGetResponseNew AsyncCallbackAddressOf requestCallback, req  Private Sub requestCallbackasyncResult As IAsyncResult Dim webRequest As HttpWebRequest  DirectCastasyncResult.AsyncState, HttpWebRequest Dim webResponse As HttpWebResponse  DirectCastwebRequest.EndGetResponseasyncResult, HttpWebResponse Dim tempStream As New MemoryStream webResponse.GetResponseStream.CopyTotempStream Dim sr As New StreamReadertempStream Dim resp As String  sr.ReadToEnd End Sub codepre  pWhats wrongp

Negative 16 pTo debug a bug Im seeing on Heroku but not on my local machine, Im trying to do stepthrough debugging. p  pThe typical codeimport pdb pdb.settracecode approach doesnt work with Heroku since you dont have access to a console connected to your app, but apparently you can use a hrefhttpspypi.python.orgpypirpdbrpdba, a remote version of pdb. p  pSo Ive installed rpdb, added codeimport rpdb rpdb.settracecode at the appropriate spot.

The default host celerys rdb remote pdb wrapper uses is codelocalhostcode, which you cant get to when its Heroku. Ive tried using the codeCELERYRDBHOSTcode environment variable to the domain of the website that is being hosted on Heroku, but that gives a Cannot assign requested address error. So its the same basic issue  how to connect to the remote pdb instance thats running on Herokup

Negative 16 pGood morning, I have a simple WPF app, that reads one table from a access 2003 database that is on my server. I have 2 client pcs that read that table and populate the categories to a listbox on my main app. When i open the application on the server it works fine, but when i run the app from a client i dont get any rows from the database. The folder is shared and can be viewed from network. Is there a problem with MS access and network related issues Thanks in advance for the help.p

Negative 16 pim working on a simple onepage website. You can navigate by clicking on links inside a fixed navigation. This fixed navigation should work like seen here a hrefhttpwww.teehanlax.comstorymedium relnofollowhttpwww.teehanlax.comstorymediumap  pSomething like Tehann  Lax does fixed navigation, which only shows when you scroll up and disappears when you scroll down i could probably do on my own.

In the sample you write a template variable that I think could be the way, but Im stucked in the resolve method of strongorg.eclipse.jface.text.templates.TemplateVariableResolverstrong.

Negative 16 pMy problem is, that I need to now, what statements passed through a If statement. The code is as follows.p  precodeint[] Array  value1,value2,value3 foreach int Value in Array  if Value lt 4       Here i need to know what values passed through that were less that 4, like          which one, value 1, value 2, andor value 3  codepre  pSo is there a solution for a problem Im kind of new to programming. My problem is that i do not need an else statement, i Need to know if value 1 or 2 or 3 passed through. Exactly which ones are less than 4. EDIT fixed some mistakes, was in a rush, forgot to put the sign the other way. When they are less than 4, i need to now which values passed through. Ill prob repost tho. As i messed up. I really dont care for now which ones are greater, or the else statement, i skipped that part. Edit2 I also came up with a solution, but i dont if its good. Should i run a loop when i store values in the if statement, making another if statement, to compare if the ones inside the if statement are the same on the outside, and then knowing which values passed throughp
Negative 16 pI have a little website which contains a div positioned at the bottom of the page, when clicked this div slides up into view.

WebCore simply throws a global switch when any sibling selector is encountered and disables style sharing for the entire document when they are present. This includes the  selector and selectors like firstchild and lastchild.pli lipThat quote seems to come from an article Hyatt wrote in 2005. Below he discusses it in more detail same source as previousbrbr emWebCore in upcoming Safari releases has a really cool optimization that I came up with to avoid even having to compute the set of declarations that apply to an element. This optimization in practice results in not even having to match style for about 60 of the elements on your page. The idea behind the optimization is to recognize when two elements in a page are going to have the same style through DOM and other state inspection and to simply share the front end style information between those two elements whenever possible.empli lipThis a hrefhttpnatek.typepad.comblog200506renderingcsse.htmlarticle by Nate Koechleya discusses the algorithm in more detail.

Negative 16 pWe operate Trunk Based Development.  Our latest and greatest code is continuously integrated into our trunk, until we are ready to get it UATd.  At that stage we create a release candidate branch from the trunk for UAT, and new development continues in the trunk.  Once this release candidate has passed UAT it will be tagged and released to Live, and a maintenance branch created from the tag which will live until the next major UATd release.p  pThe question is, how to handle the merging of bug fixes.  If a bug is fixed on the Maintenance Branch during UAT, this code fix should be merged to the trunk and to the release candidate.  If a UAT bug is fixed during UAT, this code fix should be merged to trunk.p  pWe all know this, but sometimes merges get missed, and weve had cases where bugs that were fixed in Live have resurfaced again as the fixes werent applied to all the required branches trunk and release candidate.p  pWe have started referencing the commits to other branches now in our commit comments essentially our own poor mans merge info in order to track this.p  pHowever strongis there any way for us to be absolutely sure that all commits to the maintenance branch get merged to trunk and release candidate, and that all commits to the release candidate get merged to trunkstrongp

Negative 16 pIve been doing a lot of tutorials for different MVC frameworks, and it seems very typical for Authorization to take place in the Controller. Whyp  pMy thought is the Controller should only be used to orchestrate Model actions, to handle redirection and to handle error events. These are the things that are dependent on the specific request. Putting Authorization in the Controller seems like youre going to have to duplicate the authorization whenever youre using the same Model action in different Controller actions or different Controllers. If Auth is in the Model, you have consistent requirements for carrying out an action or state change on the data.p  pIve been googling and looking at other questions such as a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7261490shouldauthorizationbepartofthemodelorcontrollerShould authorization be part of the model or controllera but I dont really see why its the accepted convention.p  pstrongIs there a specific reason Im missing for putting Authorization in the controller over the modelstrongp  h2To sum up points in the commentsh2  ul liControllers are responsible for altering the state of the model layer and the current view. Nothing else.li liAuthorization belongs where an action is being carried out, if youre following a strict MVC pattern this would most likely be the model, and a Controller is certainly not responsible for authorizing the use of model actions.li liCookies should be treated like any other datastore abstracted and used within the models, not directly by controllers.li liAuthentication and Authorization are separate issues, though they both usually go in the model layer, because they usually involve checks against values in datastores such as cookies.li ul
Negative 16 pGood day,p  pIs there a way to monitor the memory usage of a WCF servicep  pI Googled and couldnt find any proper answer. Unfortunately I dont have access to 3rd party tools like RedGate ANTS or the JetBrains memory profiler.p  pI have enabled all performance counters in my service web config in order to see if I can use the Performance Monitor to view the memory usage but I dont know where to look to get the amount of memory being used by the service.p  pI also created a load test for one of the wcf methods just as a test to see if it can tell me how much memory was used by the service during the test, but also dont think it gives me the info I need.p  pDoes anyone know how I could do this or point me in the right directionp  pThank you in advance.p

Negative 16 pIve been tasked with adding functionality to an ASP.NET 4.0 Web Forms application to warn the user shortly before their session ends, and to provide the option either to continue the session, or to end the session. p  pI have implemented this via a confirmation dialog box which warns the user that the session is going to end soon and giving the option of pressing OK to continue the session, or pressing Cancel to end the session. p  pOn pressing cancel, the page redirects to the logout page. p  pOn pressing OK, I invoke a JQuery GET request on an empty ASPX page in my application KeepAlive.aspx. As I understand, when a user makes a request to the page, ASP.NETshould take care of renewing the session  and thus resetting the session timeout. p  pHowever, I found that when the user presses OK, the session is not extended, and so it times out. This is despite the GET request apparently being successful e.g. the callback function is invoked. p  pThe code I used to implement this exists as a JavaScript function which gets invoked via the codeonloadcode event on the master page  so its inherited by all the other pages in the application. p  precodevar intervalID   Set a timeout interval based on the server timeout value 10  function setTimeoutInterval        Session timeout warning dialog        Get session timeout value     var timeoutMins  ltaspContentPlaceHolder idtimeoutPlaceholder runatservergtlt Session.Timeout gtltaspContentPlaceHoldergt       Subtract 10 of the timeout value  to give the user a chance to continue the session before it expires     var remainingTimeMins  Math.ceiltimeoutMins  0.1     var timeoutMins  timeoutMins  0.9       Convert the timeout value to milliseconds     var timeout  timeoutMins  60  1000       Set javascript timeout     intervalID  window.setIntervaldisplayTimeoutDialog  remainingTimeMins  , timeout    Display a dialog prompting the user to continue the current session or to end the session  function displayTimeoutDialogremainingTimeMins       var result  confirmThe session will end in   remainingTimeMins       minutes.

Negative 16 pWe are having some issues with our .NET app pooling connections to a SQL database, it seems like we are getting a connection leak but not sure where.p  pWe load our POCOs from a SQL server DB using a data class which has a private IDbCommand variable and a private data reader variable.  When making a call to the DB we start by passing both into a SQLAccess class which creates the connection, opens it , assigns the connection to the IDbCommands connection property and returns. p  pOnce back in the data class we use the connection to hydrate the POCO and then call Reader.close and IDbCommand.Connection.Dispose. However, when viewing the number of connections SQL has it continues to go up and up until it hits 100 and then it blows up. The connection string is hardcoded and so is the same every time. I cant understand why .NET isnt closinghandling the connections in a better way. Sorry if I am missing some key details, as I dont know the problem I am not sure exactly what is useful information and what isnt.p  pFor an examplep  pThis is one of the methods in our ImageData classp  precodepublic bool PdLoadUserToken token, string keyCode, ref Image img, int size, bool fixWidth, bool fixHeight              bool result          SqlText1  Exec PDPrAUXImage   keyCode          result  ErrRepLdtoken, Cmd1, out rdr1          if result                      ItemErrorMessageimg             return result                   HydrateThumbnailrdr1, img, size, fixWidth, fixHeight         rdr1.Close         Cmd1.Connection.Close          return result      codepre  pThis is one of the methods in our SQLAccess class its the SetProvider method that initializes the connectionp  precodepublic bool ErrRepLdUserToken token, IDbCommand cmd, out IDataReader dr              bool result  false          if SetProviderCommandtoken, cmd                      dr  defaultSqlDataReader             return result                   try                      cmd.Connection.Open             dr  cmd.ExecuteReaderCommandBehavior.CloseConnection              dr.Read             Result1  Convert.ToInt32dr[Result]             Result2  Convert.ToInt32dr[Result2]             if Result1 0                 result  true             if result                 dr.Close                  catch                       log the error             if dr  null ampamp dr.IsClosed                 dr.Close                   return result      codepre  pOne thing I am aware of is there is no finally statement with a close in the SQL Access class, but the problem is happening when that call is successful so that cant be the full story. p  pSo I guess in summary Why are my connections not being closedreused by .NETp
Negative 16 pIn nontrivial applications, I usually end up having a dumb JS object that has nothing but data in it... a data structure. Might as well have been stored as JSON somewhere and given to me when needed. But in this case an AJAX request for JSON might be unwarranted.p  pExample the codengoptionscode directive in AngularJS for dropdowns. I need to give it an array of objects, but storing that in my controller clutters it with a data structure that might well have been invisible most of the time. Many such cases, even outside angular.p  pOne solution I can think of creating a file that does nothing but store and retrieve these objects and use that across the project, but thats unnecessary network and memory consumption data that has no bearing on the current context is being fetched.p  pAnother solution would be to make these objects at the bottom of the file. But they either need to be on the window object, or Ill need to write the boilerplate for storing and fetching objects in each file I work with especially when using RequireJS. I emcouldem store this storerfetcher on the window object and pass it the JSON in each file, but I feel there is room for improvement.p  pWhat would you suggestp

Negative 16 pI have a macro that needs to be able to accept arbitrary integer or pointer types and convert them to codeunsigned long longcode. The natural way to do this is just to cast, and that works, but with the default GCC warnings it yields cast from pointer to integer of different size, and Id like to avoid that. The natural way to avoid the warning is with an intermediate cast, as in codeunsigned long longuintptrtxcode, but that doesnt work in my case becausep  ol liIt will truncate integer inputs that dont fit in codeuintptrtcode.li liIt will break proper conversion of signed inputs, e.g. 1 may become code0xffffffffcode instead of code0xffffffffffffffffcode.li ol  pIf I had an expression perhaps making fancy use of the codecode operator that could distinguish pointer from integer types, I could break it down into the two cases and apply the codeuintptrtcode cast first for pointer inputs but not for integer ones.

If they entered foo then it would exit1.p  pMy general questions are these Instead of making multiple postsp  pWhen making codeconverttointcode I know I shouldnt use codeatoicode because it doesnt fail right.

What is a better method if not sscanf or converting strtolp  pSecondly, how can I not only return an integer but also know if it found one. For example if the user entered 0 then it would return 0, thus setting off my FALSE in my if statement. I had considered using 1 if not found but since I am returning signed ints then this also suffers from the same problem.

I.e. this uses .Net 4.5. p  pIt comes with Login Control. I am hosted on Windows Azure and have successfully changed the connection string to access Azure database. Login and register work fine. However, when I click on Login, Register, or Manage, it is really slow 20 seconds. I suspect this might be related to the Membership provider. However, there is no membership provider in the template and it works without it, which might be because it uses Universal Membership. p  pThe Database is fine I checked it. It has been created, but it is still slow. When I first click on Hello, Serge it goes to the Manage.aspx page it takes 20 sec. But the second time I click on the same Hello, Serge it only takes 2 sec.p  pHow to increase speed  Is the slowliness related with Membership provider, accessing Database or downloading the huge EntityFramework.dll 5mb p  pSergep

Negative 16 pIm trying to make an open source application that will listen to a socket for incoming data, parse it and visualise this data on multiple fragments. Im programming in Android for only a couple of weeks now so I wanted to get opinions on my approach to the problemp  pSo the application is currently made of  A single activity that dynamically load fragments for UI The main activity receives Messages from a bound service  A single service that creates a socket and a connection on a separated thread This service sends Messages to all bounded client activities when incoming data is receivedp  pMy first question is  What is the cleaner way between using a Bound service or a service running in the background Ive been thinking that as this service will not be used by any other app, it should be Bound so it automatically loads and unloads with the application correctp  pMy second question is What is the best way for a two way communication between a bound service and an activity Im currently using Messages. But Ive seen that I could use a broadcast receiver in the main activity. Is there a way that is more resources consuming than the other one What is the typical clean way of communicating from a service to an activityp  pThanks for your advicesp

Negative 16 pIm trying to program the card game Euchre into python and Ive hit a roadblock in my code. At the beginning of each round, players take turns on deciding if they want the current face up card to represent trump for the round if hearts is face up then hearts would be the trump in question.p  pI give the player the first option to decide on if they want the current trump to be called and if they pass, then let each of the other three players all controlled by computer to decide if they want to call the trump. Currently, I want to make it where if the computer has at least one card that matches the trump suit in their hand then they will call up the trump, otherwise I have them pass as well.p  pMy problem is this even if a computer has a card with the trump suit in their hand they will still pass on the trump as if they had no cards of the trump suit. So for some reason my code is not correctly checking the suits of each card in the computers hands. Can any of you figure out what is going wrong herep  precodeif h in Trumpcard[0]     trumph     printHearts is trump. if d in Trumpcard[0]     trumpd     printDiamonds is trump. if s in Trumpcard[0]     trumps     printSpades is trump. if c in Trumpcard[0]     trumpc     printClubs is trump.

Then if Opp1 passed, it would give my partner a chance to see if they had the trump suit anywhere. Then if the partner passed, the second opponent would be given a chance to call trump. Thanks for any help anyone can offer.p  pThe way I have structured Opp1hand and Trumpcard is a list of strings containing the suit and card value for example, the Ace of spades is written as As. Ill list my code for creating all of my cards and how I created Opp1hand and Trumpcard as well belowp  precodeclass Cardobject     defines card class     RANK[9,10,J,Q,K,A]      list of ranks amp suits to make cards     SUIT[c,s,d,h]      def initself,rank,suit         self.rankrank         self.suitsuit      def strself         repself.rankself.suit         return rep  class Handobject     def initself         self.cards[]      def strself         if self.cards             rep             for card in self.cards                 repstrcardt         else             repEMPTY         return rep      def clearself         self.cards[]      def addself,card         self.cards.appendcard      def giveself,card,otherhand         self.cards.removecard         otherhand.addcard      def removeself,card         self.cards.removecard  class DeckHand     def populateself         for suit in Card.SUIT             for rank in Card.RANK                 self.addCardrank,suit      def shuffleself         random.shuffleself.cards      def dealself,hands,handsize1         for rounds in rangehandsize             for hand in hands                 if self.cards                     topcardself.cards[0]                     self.givetopcard,hand                 else                     printOut of cards. deck1Deck playerhandHand partnerhandHand opp1handHand opp2handHand trumpcardHand hands[playerhand,opp1hand,partnerhand,opp2hand]  deck1.populate deck1.shuffle deck1.dealhands,handsize5 deck1.givedeck1.cards[0],trumpcard this becomes the trump card players bid on  printnPrinting the current trump card  printtrumpcard  Converts all hands into lists that can have its elements removed Im only including Opp1hand and Trumpcard here but the other three are made the same way Opp1hand[stropp1hand.cards[0],stropp1hand.cards[1],stropp1hand.cards[2], stropp1hand.cards[3],stropp1hand.cards[4]]  Trumpcard[strtrumpcard.cards[0]] codepre  pSo an example of how Opp1hand and Trumphand would be displayed isp  precodeOpp1hand[As,10d,9c,Kh,Jh] Trumpcard[Qc] codepre  pWhat confuses me is when I was labeling what trump was in the very first block of code at the top the program was able to correctly pick out which suit h,s,c,d was in Trumpcard and then define trump accordingly. But when I try and check through Opp1hand, Partnerhand, and Opp2hand, for some reason the code wont recognize what suit each card has. If this isnt the best way to go about this, do one of you know of a better way to determine what the suit of each card isp
Negative 16 pI am running my own gem server with a hrefhttpsgithub.comgeminaboxgeminabox relnofollowgeminaboxa. This gem server hosts private forks of several public gems, as well as my own gems. I have a Gemfile with the sources listed like sop  precodesource httpsrubygems.org source httpmygemserver codepre  pWhen Bundler installs a bundle, I would like it to always use the version available on my gem server if it exists and satisfies the version requirements. I cant get this to work. Instead, bundler seems to pull from rubygems unless it cant find a gem with the same name there. This may be because the versions on rubygems are higher. However, bundlers documentation makes no mention of version numbers. This is how it describes source priorityp  blockquote   pSOURCE PRIORITYbr   When attempting to locate a gem to satisfy a gem requirement, bundler uses the following priority orderp      pThe source explicitly attached to the gem using path or gitbr   For implicit gems dependencies of explicit gems, any git or path repository otherwise declared. This results in bundler prioritizing the ActiveSupport gem from the Rails git repository over ones from rubygems.orgbr   The sources specified via source, searching each source in your Gemfile from last added to first added.p blockquote  pAlso, I know it is possible to explicitly list a source for each gem in the Gemfile. I would prefer to avoid this, since I have many of my own gems, and it is annoying to make explicit entries in the Gemfile for dependencies of dependencies which you have to do, because bundler will not read the Gemfile of dependencies.p  pHow can I achieve my goalp

Negative 16 pIve started a new project in which I like to used the current version of PHP 5.5.12. I compiled this version myself because the version of my distro is 5.3. br  I need propel ORM so I installed it via composer. br p  pNow, the propelscript uses this shebangp  precodeusrbinenv php codepre  pwhich of course calls the main PHP 5.3 and not my selfcompiled one. Unfortunately propel needs PHP  5.4 and I cannot execute the script without errors.brbr So my quickanddirty solution is to replace the first line in the propelscript withp  precodeoptphp5.5.12binphp codepre  pwhich works, but is not updatesafe. At least I think this could be replaced by doing a composerupdate.brI still need the 5.3version for other projects, so using an alias is no solution for me.brbr  Its maybe some petty problem, but is there a finer way to combine 3rdpartylibraries via composer with a selfcompiled php executablep

Negative 16 pI am new with NodeJs and Express frameworks. I have understood that Node works with only one thread on the server side. So, I have noticed this causes me some problems in order to develop correctly my application.p  pIn my routes folder, I have a file index.js. This file manage the navigation asked by the user from app.js.p  pSo I decided to create a route function test. In this function, I had just that code p  precodeexports.test  functionreq, res    res.rendertest,   codepre  pSo simple, so easy. Thats rend the template test.jade in my views folder. Greats  But I wanna complexify the process. In this test route function, I want load some content from my MYSQL database.p  pFor that, I have created a folder strongModelsstrong in the folders strongnodemodulesstrong Inside, I have only 2 file, the first strongmysqlConnection.jsstrong which exports the variable DB in order to make queries.p  precodevar mysql  requiremysql  var DB  mysql.createConnection           host      localhost,       user      root,       password  ,       database  test,           DB.connect module.exports  DB codepre  pIn the second file, strongarticlesclass.jsstrong, I just havep  precodevar DB  requiremodelsmysqlConnection  var Article  function   this.getArticles  function      DB.querySELECT  FROM articles, functionerr, rows, fields               if err              throw err         else                      console.logrows             return rows                  module.exports  Article codepre  pGo back in my route test function p  pI just want to load from table test all the articles. Very basic. But not easy. Why  Because before the query is finished, NodeJs respond to the client with the template render, but, unfornlty, without the rows loaded. Asynchronous problem ... Mysql doesnt block the Nodejs javascript Instruction.p  pThe code of the function  p  precodeexports.test  functionreq, res  var Article  requiremodelsarticlesclass a  new Article articles  a.getArticles  console.logarticles  undefined  res.rendertest,   codepre  pI Found others subjects in stackoverflow which speak about this problem. Make sync queries, work with callbacks ect .. But for, here, if I try to manage this problem with callbacks, Thats cannot work ... Because I need to send to the client the template with articles but I cant block the process with a sync method.p  pI am very lost ... I dont understand how I have to build my application. I am not able to create a good proceed in order to manage the sql queries. There is a pattern or a specific method p  pOr perhaps I have to make only ajax requests from the client. I load the template test. And in a javascript file in the public folder, I ask to the server to load me the articles content and wait success callback function  its not very clean ...p  pThx for your answers. The others answers I have found didnt help me to understand how manage that with NodeJs.p

Negative 16 pSo I have a little group manager that consists of a pair of ListBoxes, 2 BindingLists and custom class. Abstract looks like thisp  precodeclass MyClass  public int ItemId public string Name public string Other ...  ... BindingListltMYClassgt allItems  new BindingListltMyClassgt BindingListltMyClassgt selectedItems  new BindingListltMyClassgt ... ListBox1.Datasource  allItems ListBox1.DisplayMember  Name ListBox1.ValueMember  ItemId ... ListBox2.DataSource  selectedItems ListBox2.DisplayMember  Name ListBox2.ValueMember  ItemId ... private void MoveItemMyObject item, BindingListltMyClassgt fromList, BindingListltMyClassgt toList  toList.Additem fromList.Deleteitem  ... codepre  pEverything works well and issue is purely cosmetic. As items are moved between lists they assume new position in respective list thus new position in the ListBox is assumed at the end of the ListBox. That may be confusing to the user. When I enable Sorted parameter on ListBoxes, the display order is correct but wrong objects are moved. So my question is  how do I order items by ItemId so they maintain their positions consistent in both the BindingList and respective ListBox.p

The developers though state that DirectX does not need to clear its textures manually, it simply swaps them out automatically when not used.p  pHowever my game seems to increase its memory usage with each different level. I am still testing for leaks and whatnot, however Id like to use EmptyWorkingSet winapi function to lower the memory usage.p  pI do have the HWND of the application, how can I get its proccess id and use EmptyWorkingSet to clear the unused memoryp
Negative 16 pHow do I get the mouse position. I have triedp  precodeint mouseX  MouseInfo.getPointerInfo.getLocation.x     int mouseY  MouseInfo.getPointerInfo.getLocation.y codepre  pBut that does it for the whole screen. Anyway to do it relative to the JPanelJFramep  pIf Im only using Graphics JFrame and JPanel that is being repainted every millisecond, should I have buffers Or will it be fine p
Negative 16 pI am using ace editor plugin on my web application written in PHP. This has probably nothing to do with ace editor. Rather, its probably have to do with the difference encoding methods between the OSs.p  pTab indentations and line breaks are lost after form is submitted via POST in production Ubuntu. However, it works on my local windows dev machine.p  pI am able to encode line breaks by replacing rn and n with n. However, I cannot find a way to encode tab keys.p
Negative 16 pI have a linked list program where the TailNode class inherits from the Node class and both classes use a Data class parameter. Data has already been forward declared in my Node class header, but I dont understand why my program runs fine even though I havent forward declared Data in my TailNode derived class header.p  pDo derived classes also inherit forward declarations used by the base class What am I missing herep  pHere are my two headers Node and TailNode...p  pstrongNode.hstrongp  precodeifndef NODEH define NODEH  class Data    forward declaration  class Node  public     Node     virtual Node     virtual Node InsertData theData  0     virtual void Show  0   endif codepre  pstrongTailNode.hstrongp  precodeifndef TAILNODEH define TAILNODEH  class TailNode  public Node  public     TailNode     TailNode     virtual Node InsertData theData     virtual void Show     endif  TailNode inherits everything from Node and seems to not need Data forward declared maybe because it was already forward declared for Node class codepre
Negative 16 pIve used C for a while and one thing which occasionally bugs me is that I havent yet been able to figure out how to do this Delphi Factory construct in C.p  pThe key part that I cant figure out is how to pass a reference to a class type in C.  In Delphi, we have TClass type.  Variables of this type are a reference to some class.  We can restrict the classes that a class reference can refer to using the codeclass of MyClasscode syntax to define a new class reference type.p  pemNote that the term Delphi class reference  C instance of a classemp  pFor those unfamiliar with Pascal, variables are declared codevariable typecode rather than the Cstyle codetype variablecode.  Similarly, a functions return type appears emafterem the parameter list and name.p  pIve condensed the syntax in the following example to make it less boilerplatey, so apologies to Delphi devs for the terrible formatting.  The key parts are described in comments.p  precodeprogram demo  APPTYPE CONSOLE   declarations  type    Base  class   public constructor Createname string virtual   end     Class reference which refers to Base and its descendants   BaseClass  class of Base    ChildA  classBase   public constructor Createname string override   end    ChildB  classBase   public constructor Createname string override   end   implementation  constructor Base.Createname string begin   WriteLnBase says hi to   name end  constructor ChildA.Createname string begin   inherited Createname   WriteLnChildA says hi to   name end  constructor ChildB.Createname string begin   WriteLnChildB says hi to   name end    THIS IS THE BIT THAT IM INTERESTED IN   The function doesnt know at compile time exactly what class it is being  asked to construct.  The compiler knows that it is or inherits from Base.  I cant find any kind of class reference in C. function ConstructSomethingClassType BaseClass name string Base begin   Result  ClassType.Createname end   Equivalent to main in C begin     Pass references to a class to the ConstructSomething function   ConstructSomethingBase, Mark   WriteLn    ConstructSomethingChildA, Mark   WriteLn    ConstructSomethingChildB, Mark   WriteLn  end. codepre  pOutputp  precodeBase says hi to Mark  Base says hi to Mark ChildA says hi to Mark  ChildB says hi to Mark codepre  pNote that when a reference to a child class is passed then the child class is created.  Not calling the base constructor in ChildB is intentional in this demo, to make the class reference concept slightly more obvious.p

Negative 16 pSo, obviously I am doing something wrong here. I have an app that uses MVC and in one of my model classes I have a call to a web service which could take some time to process. The view controller calls a method in the model class which starts the download process. The download process is performed through an AFHTTPRequestOperation which is placed in an NSOperationQueue. The entire download process happens in the model class, outside of the view controller. However, the download operation appears to block the main thread as the UI becomes unresponsive during the operation. I have hardcoded a pause to simulate a slow network. When the operation completes, it calls the view controller through a delegate method. This code works, but as I mentioned, it blocks the main thread.p  pIn my model class StreamGauge I have the followingp  precodevoidgetGaugeReadings      NSString endpointURL  [NSString stringWithFormathttp..., stationID, timeSpan]      NSURL url  [NSURL URLWithStringendpointURL]     NSURLRequest request  [NSURLRequest requestWithURLurl]     AFHTTPRequestOperation operation  [[AFHTTPRequestOperation alloc] initWithRequestrequest]     [operation setCompletionBlockWithSuccessAFHTTPRequestOperation operation, id responseObject         NSData data  NSDataresponseObject         [self processXmlObjectdata]         [self setGaugeFlowKeys[self getFlowKeys]]         [NSThread sleepForTimeInterval3]         [self.delegate updateGaugeTable]     failureAFHTTPRequestOperation operation, NSError err         NSLogERROR , [err localizedDescription]     ]      NSOperationQueue gaugeDownloadQueue  [[NSOperationQueue alloc] init]     [gaugeDownloadQueue setNameGaugeDownload]     [gaugeDownloadQueue addOperationoperation]  codepre  pIn my view controller I have the following in my viewDidLoad with hardcoded parametersp  precode voidviewDidLoad      [super viewDidLoad]     gauge  [[StreamGauge alloc] initWithStationIDA3185AX400 forTimeSpan24]             [gauge setDelegateself]     [gauge getGaugeReadings]  codepre  pI am more accustomed to using GCD for stuff like this, but now I need the ability to cancel the operation after a timeout has expired, so NSOperationQueue is more appropriate, but obviously my lack of a thorough understanding of operation queues is an issue here.p  pCould there be any issues with placing this background operation in a model class Should background operation always be in controller classes Anything else I am doing wrong herep

I also put it as complete and in .done function after the ajax call and it still runs before all the inside code is complete.  The function codeupdateNewAccountToAddressBlockcode basically makes another jquery ajax request with this type codeasynctruecode, and returns json that is then used in about 10 functions or sub functions in the success call. One of these uses this data to fill out all the fields of a form.  My function I am trying to call at the end is supposed to validate the info that is being populated.  But no matter what I try, the validation is failing because the autoContineCart is being run before the fields are being populated.  I also tried to use a callback like codeupdateNewAccountToAddressBlockupdateAddressSelectioncode and then checked callback function inside of that and it also didnt work.  Anyone have an idea what I could be doing wrongp

Negative 16 pIm just learning about CUDAOpenCL, but I have a conceptual question. Suppose I am encoding an algorithm to do a BreadthFirstSearch on a graph. Suppose my target device is a GPU with only 2 workgroups of 2 processing elements i.e., 4 cores. Intuitivelly, I guess the search could be done in parallel by keeping an array of nodes to visit. For each pass, each node is visited in parallel and added to the next nodes to visit array. For example, a hrefhttpi.imgur.comV4KpLon.png relnofollowthis grapha could spawn the following searchp  precodestart must visit A parallel pass 1 must visit B, C, D parallel pass 2 must visit E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M parallel pass 3 must visit N, O, P parallel pass 4 must visit Q parallel pass 5 done codepre  pA way to do it, I suppose, would be to call a ND range kernel 5 times example in OpenCLp  precodeclEnqueueNDRangeKernelqueue, kernel, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, NULL, NULL clEnqueueNDRangeKernelqueue, kernel, 1, 0, 1, 3, 0, NULL, NULL clEnqueueNDRangeKernelqueue, kernel, 1, 0, 1, 9, 0, NULL, NULL clEnqueueNDRangeKernelqueue, kernel, 1, 0, 1, 3, 0, NULL, NULL clEnqueueNDRangeKernelqueue, kernel, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, NULL, NULL codepre  pOf course, this is hardcoded for this case, so, to avoid that, I guess I could keep a counter of nodes to visit. This sounds wrong, though it doesnt fit the layout of a GPU, at all. For example, on the third call, you are using 1 work group of 9 work items, when your GPU has 2 work groups of 2 work items...p  pAnother way I see could be the following example in OpenCLp  precodewhile work not complete...     clEnqueueNDRangeKernelqueue, kernel, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0, NULL, NULL codepre  pThis would call clEnqueueNDRangeKernel continously in a way that fits perfectly the GPU layout, until it receives a signal that the work is done. But this time, the ids received by the kernel wouldnt fit the layout of the algorithmp  pWhat is the right way to do this Am I missing somethingp

Negative 16 pSuppose I need to select a list of nodes based on multiple criteria title of book, subject of book, author of book, price of book..., each of which may involve selecting any of multiple values subject is one of Thailand, Finance, History author is one of Bob, Ted, Carol, Alicep  pThe resulting XPath query can be very long, and the syntax quite complicated.      Instead of doing the query in a single pass, is it possible to do an initial query only considering subject, for example, generate a list of nodes, and then apply a second XPath query, to reduce that list of nodes to a shorter listp  pIt appears to me the answer is no, since the selectNodes method can not be applied to an IXMLDOMNodeList object, which the initial result would be.       Am I missing something       Is there a way of doing thisp  p[The context of the question is       A form is presented to the user, to select criteria for a report generator.        The user may select one or more criteria, with varying degrees of detail.

Negative 16 pI am new to Angularjs. I have an app that has a header left nav and main built using multiple templates.  The header also has another template for breadcrums and dropdown navigation.p  pThe breadcrums a created dynamically depending on what has been clicked in the menu.  It is also connected to the url parameters mentioned. p  pFor ex., the url can be something like the following depending on where the user has clicked in the appcodehttpmyappindex.htmlparent1200child1207code .p  pI can use the same url to be bookmarked and when the user enters this the breadcrum is loading correctly. Say based on this url the bread crum will show p  pstrongHome  Parent Name  Child Namestrongp  pThe issuep  pSay I have loaded the bookmarked url and now in the address bar of the browser I just update the url top  precodehttpmyappindex.htmlparent1200 codepre  pand press enter, my left hand view and the main view gets updated by my breadcrums still showsp  pstrongHome  Parent Name  Child Namestrong p  pwhen it should change and show p  pstrongHome  Parent Namestrong. p  pIf I refresh the page with that URL thenthe whole app refreshes and loads the correct breadcrum.p  pNot sure if I am missing out some thing. How can I force the breadcrum template to refresh if the url has changedp  pAppreciate you help with this.p  pthanks.p

Negative 16 pI have an webforms ASPX page, which has a dynamically added user control. The user control has two DropDownLists, one is in an UpdatePanel as its items depend on the selection in the first DropDownList.p  pThe problem is that if you do not change the value of the first DropDownList the value of the second DropDownList does not get saved. If you do change the value of the first DropDownList then it works fine.p  pThis is how it works briefly...p  pThe first time the page loads, the previous values are set. This happens in the main ASPX page PageLoad event where the user control is dynamically added and the initial values are set through a property of the user control. The property sets the selected value of the first DropDownList, triggers the SelectedIndexChanged event which populates items in the second DropDownList with choices based on the first DropDownList selection, and then selects the previous value of the second DropDownList.p  pThen in the main ASPX page, the user control is dynamically added again on post back in the PreLoad event.p  pViewstate is fully enabled throughout.p  pI have debugged and on post back the second DropDownList has no Items. Even during the UpdatePanel partial post back the items collection is empty. However, if the first DropDownList is changed then the Items collection is correct  its only if the second DropDownList is last populated on the initial load that the problem happens.p  pHeres the relevant parts of the code...p  pAny help greatly appreciated.p  pASPX pagep  precodeprotected void PagePreLoadobject sender, EventArgs e      if Page.IsPostBack              PopulateTemplateOptions        protected void PopulateTemplateOptionsbool init  false       this is where the control is dynamically added      If not post back then initial values are set by passing values to       user controls TemplateOptions property  codepre  pUser controlp  precodepublic string TemplateOptions      set               this is where the initial values are set        protected void ddlEnquirySubjectDefaultSelectedIndexChangedobject sender, EventArgs e      this is where items are added to the second drop down list based on the selection in the first one.  codepre  pThese are the only parts that are relevant, but theres another 7,000 lines of code I didnt include.p

The performance of the prefetcher depends on x and some other similar definitions.  p  pI would like to have a program that changes x, recompiles the new code, runs it, looks at the value, and based on the change in simulated access time repeats the process.p  pDoes anyone know of an easy way to do this that isnt manually changing valuesp  pEDIT I think I need to clarify that I do not want to have to program a learning algorithm since I have never done it and probably couldnt do it nearly as well as others.p

I have done plenty of form submits, etc. in JQuery before, but is there a way to do this without JQuery One would hope Coldfusion would have the capability to do this, though of course I wouldnt be surprised if it didnt.p

Negative 16 pI recently started using the alljoyn android sdk with Unity. Ive been reading a lot of documentation lately, but I just cant figure the solution for my problem. Establishing connection between the devices is no problem, the devices connects succesfully to a session.p  pThe problem is, when I want to sent a message, from one device to another device, through the chat app. The message that I send from device A is shown on device A, but not device B. SendChatSignal method is called, which calls the Signal method codeAllJoyn.QStatus status  Signalnull, currentSessionId, chatMember, payload, 0, 64code Which returns QStatus.OK.

Negative 16 pI have an application that allows the user to create a Bluetooth connection to another device. The same application is run on both devices and the user can select whether the application should act as a client or server connection. The server connection allows the user to send data to the client that is implemented in such a way to write back any data that is read. p  pI am running into an issue implementing a read timeout for the InputStream read method calls based on the answer to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1281237howdoigetfuturetasktoreturnaftertimeoutexceptionHow do I get FutureTask to return after TimeoutExceptiona. The problem I am seeing is that after I cancel the Future as the result of a timeout exception, no callable that is submitted to the executor in the future will ever be executed I see this via the debugger and print outs. This leads to a constant state of read timeouts that seems unrecoverable.p  pMy code for the readwithtimeout is as followsp  precodeprotected final int readWithTimeoutfinal byte[] buffer, final int offset,                                     final int readLength,                                     long timeoutMs throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException, TimeoutException      CallableltIntegergt callable  new CallableltIntegergt              Override         public Integer call throws Exception                      logger.infoAbout to read...             return inputStream.readbuffer, offset, readLength                    FutureltIntegergt future  this.executor.submitcallable      try              return future.gettimeoutMs, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS          catch InterruptedException  ExecutionException  TimeoutException e              future.canceltrue         throw e       codepre  pWhere codeexecutorcode is a single thread codeExecutorServicecode, codethiscode is a connection base class that is extended by both the server and client code and codeinputStreamcode is the input stream that was retrieved from the connected BluetoothSocket.p  pstrongMore informationstrongp  pEach connection server and client is implemented as a single thread with a IO loop therefore, the read timeout is necessary otherwise the thread will not be able to send messages. Is this the wrong way to implement an asynchronous connection of this kind i.e. having both the read and write logic running in the same thread I think that if I implemented the read and write logic in separate threads then having a blocking read would not be an issue as I could always close the BluetoothSocket thus causing an IOException to be thrown by the read method to interrupt the reader thread if the connection needed to be closed. However, this does not seem like a good solution to have 2 threads per connection.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI ended up changing my implementation to use two loops one for reading and one for writing and controlling the connection life cycle. The read thread was allowed to block no timeouts and, because of the second writing thread, the writing logic could continue regardless of the state of the reads. In the event that I had to reset the connection, I closed the socket in the writer thread which would then unblock any reads in the reader thread and the reader thread could be shutdown.p  pI am still curious about how this should be done with codeFuturecodes.p
Negative 16 pI ran into a problem having to do with codeUISplitViewControllercode and modal view controllers on the iPad, so I tried to reproduce the issue in a small project to see if I could figure out what was going on.

Negative 16 pI am working on a setup with multiple databases, technology stacks spring with hibernate running on tomcat 6. Transactions across databases was not a requirement, and each database has its own dataSource, sessionFactory and transactionManager org.springframework.orm.hibernate3.HibernateTransactionManager with a declarative use of transaction management Transactional annotation. Recently there have been a requirement to have a oneoff case of making insertions in two of those DBs say db1 and db2 transactional.p  pI am aware that there are third party libraries like JOTM and atomikos, which can add JTA support to tomcat. But I would like to know if its at all possible to manage transactions manually. p  pFor example, can there be something like followingp  precodeTransaction transactionDb1      sessionFactoryDb1.getCurrentSession.beginTransaction Transaction transactionDb2  sessionFactoryDb2.getCurrentSession.beginTransaction try       DAO layer call to DB1      DAO layer call to DB2      transactionDb1.commit     transactionDb2.commit  catch Exception e      transactionDb1.rollback     transactionDb2.rollback  codepre  pIt probably wouldnt be as simplistic. But is something like that possible As far as I know Programmatic transactional handling can be used. But how do I go about it combining with the declarative approach Would I still be able to use Transactional for other cases Any help would be really appreciated.p

Negative 16 pIm new to postgres, and Im trying to figure out how to best secure my databases when running web applications.p  pIn MySQL, I tend to use an administration user for things like creating databases, creating tables, modifying schemas, dropping tables etc. for all activities that should never happen when the database is used by some application on an ongoing basis. Then I have a second user one for each application that has only the rights the application needs, like insert, update etc. This avoids that application bugs  hacks have catastrophic consequences.p  pNow Im trying to figure out how to do a similar thing in postgres. It seems that postgres databases have an owner, unlike MySQL ones. If I used my scheme above, should the administration user own all databases for all applications Or what are some best practices herep  pAddition Im just finding out that granting permissions on all tables seems to mean all tables currently defined and does not include future tables. Unlike MySQL, where on foo. means all current and future tables. Is that correct Is there a way to include future tables as well in the grant statement, or do I have reexecute every timep

Negative 16 pI have been playing around with Symfony for about a month now. I like the framework so far, but I have run into a problem which is making me suspicious of the Form component.p  pstrongOverviewstrong I have two forms, one each for the following entitiesp  ul liPostsli liTagsli ul  pThey have a many to many bidirectional relationship. The Tags form is embedded in the Posts form to allow new tags to be created and associated with the post on the fly. p  pstrongProblemstrong This works just fine with cascade enabled when a new tag entry is used. However, if an existing tag entry is reused, a unique constraint violation is triggered by the Tags entity. The embedded form basically works as a utility to only create new tags, where as I want to use it in a conditional scenario where existing tags are not inserted but only associated with the parent form.p  pIn a bid to try and avoid duplication issues, I turned off cascade and played around with doctrine listeners. However, I couldnt find a way around it. Does any one have any ideas I could obviously handle the form submission manually, but that would halfdefeat the purpose of using the Form component.p  pstrongForm Typestrongp  ul liBoth forms extend AbstractTypeli ul  pstrongControllerstrongp  ul lipThe particular action that handles the code looks something like thisp  precodeem  thisgtgetDoctrinegtgetManager  entity  emgtgetRepositoryB4PGround0BundleBlogBloggtfindid  if entity      throw thisgtcreateNotFoundExceptionUnable to find Blog entity.   deleteForm  thisgtcreateDeleteFormid editForm  thisgtcreateEditFormentity editFormgthandleRequestrequest  if editFormgtisValid      emgtflush codepreli ul  pstrongEntitiesstrongp  ul lipExcerpt from the strongBlogstrong  class  Blog is the same as the aforementioned Postsp  precode   ORMManyToManytargetEntityTag, inversedByblogs   ORMJoinTablenametagsblogs   AssertValid   private tags ....... public function addTagtag      tagsgtaddBlogthis     thisgttags[]  tags     return this  codepreli lipExcerpt from the strongTagsstrong classp  precode   ORMManyToManytargetEntityBlog, mappedBytags   private blogs .... public function addBlogblog      thisgtblogs[]  blogs     return this  codepre  ppli ul

Negative 16 pIm working on a page that has separate styling from the rest of my site. So Im doing all the HTML and CSS within that page.  Currently I am trying to make a semicomplex at least for me accordion.  This is how I would like it to workp  ul liHover to expand Got that farli liClick to to keep open until another slide is clickedli liHave a header that is part of the main accordion but not affected by the hovers and clicksli ul  pI also plan on adding in images as well as possibly additional accordions within.  The internal accordions would be horizontal and the main ones are vertical.p  pIve also managed to muk this up a bit.

Rather than worrying about pulling down external changes, a submodule allows be to setup the dist directory as a separate repo that I can deploy independently to Heroku.p  pThis all works nicely on localhost where I can cd into the submodule directory after grunt has completed its build, and then just commit the changes and push them to the submodules repo.

Negative 16 pHello to anyone who may be able to help with this. p  pI had been using Ckeditor3 and had created a simple custom image browser. It worked perfectly. I would click the image button and the dialog box would pop up and then I would click the browse server button. I searched the images and when I found one I wanted to use I clicked it the image browser would automatically close and the image would then show up in the image preview box in the image plugin dialog box. p  pUnfortunately the image plugin for ckeditor 3 has become incompatible with Internet Explorer 11. So I upgraded to the latest Ckeditor 4.p  pSo now in ckeditor 4 I can still open the image dialog and click the image browser and browse my images but now when I select an image, although the image browser closes as it should the image is not being passed back to the plugins preview box or url field within the dialog box. It just remains blank. If i manually paste in an image url the image will show up in the preview box but no longer from the image browser anymore.p  pi have spent hours looking for a solution on google and am coming up empty, anyone have any ideasp

Negative 16 pWe have a WebAPI project hosted on Azure, that provides users device management capabilities. Now we have some internal requirements about the system, and weve been having discussions over the best approach to handle these requirements. If they are not direct user requirements, should we still expose the functionality in the public APIp  pConsider this example which is actually the real world scenario we have here. We store gps locations for each of the users devices. Since we allow posting of coordinates at will, this can and does get very big very fast. With that in mind, we need some form of cleanup of these coordinates. We have decided that we will keep at most 60 days of coordinates for any given device, and this value can be configured per device to other smaller values.p  pThe first thing that came to my mind to perform this cleanup was creating a WebJob in Azure, since it needs to be scheduled and run once a day. But then, there are two possible alternatives that I can see to accomplish thatp  ol lipstrongSmart WebJobstrong The WebJob has direct access to the database and all our models. It will iterate over all devices and delete their coordinates as it sees fit. Direct method calls using EF context here, no business logic module.pli lipstrongDumb WebJobstrong The WebJob calls into our API to delete the coordinates. The deletion logic is in the API.pli ol  pThe point is we dont currently have a route to delete the coordinates in the API. The user can only add coordinates to it, and the system is responsible for removing them.p  pIs it good design to create such a method in the API, so that the job can call it I was thinking of a method that allows users to delete coordinates delete a single coordinate, or a whole day worth of coordinates, or similar, and then in the Job add the business rule of deleting everything older than 60 days by calling the API to do it. That way, the control of entities is still in the API, while the maintenance logic is in the job.p  pA colleague of mine pointed out that by doing it this way I was exposing system related functionality to the end user, and by doing that we could end up having problems in the future, like other things being affected if the user called this deletion method at inappropriate times, and he also pointed out that deleting coordinates is not a requirement of the API itself, so it should not be exposed.p  pMy view on it is that it is intuitive for a user to be able to delete something that he can add, so adding the deletion method is not a problem even if it is not a direct requirement of the API. Also, I feel like exposing the base functionality in the API and making the WebJob dumber leads to a clearer more centralized design. If we separated both, the webjob wouldnt need direct access to the database, and thus would be a lot more decoupled. The only dependency the dumb version has is the API url, while the smart one needs connection strings and all of our api dlls.p  pWhen thinking about end user access, I also thought about exposing this method only for a specific administrator or maintenance user or role as a solution, and then creating that user in our API and calling from the job with said user. This user would have permission to call the deletion route for all other users.p  pPlease keep in mind that this is probably not very fit for a pure database job, since the persistence time is variable depending on user settings, and we would like to avoid having variable business rules in the database.p  pHow can I more cleanly add this cleanup functionality without exposing extraneous stuff in the API Should I perhaps consider another approach besides those I mentionedp

I am able to set up a codeUIPageControlcode along with a codeUIScrollViewcode to page between two images, but how do I set up two codeUITableViewcodes next to each other within a codeUIScrollViewcode whos width is of codescreenWidth2code to page between the table viewsp  pThe tricky part is, once I get this to work, I need to be able to put the resulting construct itself into a codeUITableViewCellcode because the whole thing is also part of a bigger encompassing table view. p  pWould I create two different codeUITableViewControllercode classes that each load their respective data, and then dynamically load those into codeUIViewcodes of codescreenWidthcode width in the codeUIScrollViewcode Im really lost here as to how to go about this. p

Negative 16 pWeve been looking into implementing an Oracle Database system using Docker on our server and are considering two different strategies for managing our datap  ul liStoring the database files .dbfs in a folder on the servers path, and then making that folder available in a container using the v option. The idea is to have multiple containers accessing multiple folders so we can manage different versions of our data.li liKeeping the database files inside the container as if it were a regular installation.li ul  pThe reason behind this is that we like the idea of being able to change versions on the fly, when we need to revert to an old version of our program to fix a bug for example if an older version is in production than the one were currently working on. In that sense, the containers we have should also have a specific version of our app in them its a webapp.p  pSo my question is the following which approach would be the best in our case Is there another organization of our containers that we missed and would be better Looking for more opinions on the matter. Weve been told already that the first method would perform better than keeping everything in containers, but our tests have not shown any improvement.p  pThanks p

Closing and reopening the window will also cause it to display the correct data.p  pThe xaml for the list view window isp  precodeltGridgt     ltListView NameRunningCycleListView HorizontalAlignmentLeft Height266 VerticalAlignmentTop Width546 ItemsSourceBinding RunningCycles, BindsDirectlyToSourceTruegt         ltListView.Resourcesgt             ltStyle TargetTypexType ListViewItemgt                 ltStyle.Triggersgt                     ltDataTrigger BindingBinding OverCycleLogged Valuetruegt                         ltSetter PropertyBackground ValueRedgt                     ltDataTriggergt                 ltStyle.Triggersgt             ltStylegt         ltListView.Resourcesgt         ltListView.Viewgt             ltGridViewgt                 ltGridViewColumn DisplayMemberBindingBinding Namegt                     ltGridViewColumnHeader Width100gt                         ltTextBlock TextCycle Namegt                     ltGridViewColumnHeadergt                 ltGridViewColumngt                 ltGridViewColumn DisplayMemberBindingBinding AGV.AgvGroupgt                     ltGridViewColumnHeader Width67gt                         ltTextBlock TextGroupgt                     ltGridViewColumnHeadergt                 ltGridViewColumngt                 ltGridViewColumn DisplayMemberBindingBinding AGV.Typegt                     ltGridViewColumnHeader Width67gt                         ltTextBlock TextTypegt                     ltGridViewColumnHeadergt                 ltGridViewColumngt                 ltGridViewColumn DisplayMemberBindingBinding AGV.AgvIDNumber Width90gt                     ltGridViewColumnHeader Width90gt                         ltTextBlock TextIDgt                     ltGridViewColumnHeadergt                 ltGridViewColumngt                 ltGridViewColumn DisplayMemberBindingBinding StartTime Width140gt                     ltGridViewColumnHeader Width140gt                         ltTextBlock TextStart Timegt                     ltGridViewColumnHeadergt                 ltGridViewColumngt                 ltGridViewColumn DisplayMemberBindingBinding MaxTimegt                     ltGridViewColumnHeader Width75gt                         ltTextBlock TextMax Timegt                     ltGridViewColumnHeadergt                 ltGridViewColumngt             ltGridViewgt         ltListView.Viewgt     ltListViewgt ltGridgt codepre  pThe c associated with that is simplep  precode    public partial class CycleViewerWindow  Window      public CycleViewerVM viewModel      public CycleViewerWindowObservableCollectionltCycleTimergt runningCycles              this.viewModel  new CycleViewerVMrunningCycles         InitializeComponent         this.DataContext  viewModel         this.Closing  CycleViewerWindowClosing           void CycleViewerWindowClosingobject sender, System.ComponentModel.CancelEventArgs e              this.Closing  CycleViewerWindowClosing      codepre  pAnd finally the view model...p  precodepublic class CycleViewerVM      public CycleViewerVMObservableCollectionltCycleTimergt runningCycles              this.RunningCycles  runningCycles          private ObservableCollectionltCycleTimergt runningCycles     public ObservableCollectionltCycleTimergt RunningCycles              get  return runningCycles          set  this.runningCycles  value        codepre  pI believe the ListView is bound to the ObservableCollection correctly, but cant seem to find whats wrong or a suitable work around.p  pCycleTimer classp  precodepublic class CycleTimer      region Constructors      public CycleTimerstring cycleTimerName, int CycleTimerStartRfid, int CycleTimerStopRfid, int CycleTimerMaxCount, AGVData agv  null              this.name  cycleTimerName         this.cycleStartRfid  CycleTimerStartRfid         this.cycleStopRfid  CycleTimerStopRfid         this.maxTime  CycleTimerMaxCount         this.agv  agv         this.startTime  DateTime.Now           endregion Constructors      region Fields and Properties      private string name     public string Name              get  return name          set  name  value            private DateTime startTime     public DateTime StartTime              get  return startTime          protected set  startTime  value            private int maxTime     public int MaxTime              get  return maxTime          set  maxTime  value           private AGVData agv     public AGVData AGV              get  return agv             private Boolean overCycleLogged     public Boolean OverCycleLogged              get  return this.overCycleLogged          set  this.overCycleLogged  value           endregion Fields and Properties      region Methods      public Boolean isOverCycle              DateTime maximumTime  this.startTime.AddSecondsthis.maxTime         if DateTime.Now gt maximumTime                      return true                  return false          endregion Methods codepre

So now both files are called activitymain.xml. However the problem is that when I run the emulator for the big screen it still only displays the content using the layout created for 3.4 inch screen. p  pCan anybody help me with this Why is thatp

Negative 16 pIm using springdatacassandra 1.1.2.RELEASE for mapping objects from and to Cassandra DB through spring data repositories. I have a particular requirement that is that a password class attribute must be encrypted in the database and must be decrypted when the data is loaded from DB.p  pWeve done this before using springdatamongo and adding custom event listeners through codeAbstractMongoEventListenercode where we use jasypt to encryptdecrypt just before and after the object is readwrite to the database.p  pWeve been trying to use some event listeners for Cassandra if they exist.

Negative 16 pI have a solution AllinOne.sln lets call it Project1 under location p  blockquote   pcStudyMVCAllinOne.slnp blockquote  pI copied this solution lets call it Project2 to another location p  blockquote   pcStudyAllinOne.slnp blockquote  pI then made some changes in the Project1 and built it. I debugged the solution in IE and it showed me changes I had made. Now I opened and built Project2 and tried to debug it. But it showed me changes I had made in Project1. Seems as if it is picking the built files of Project1. p  pI checked and changed the .sln and .csproj files of both the projects for references etc but the issue is still the same.  I noticed that if I close both the projects and open any one of them again and built it then upon running the second project it always shows me the project I opened first as if they both are pointing to same bin folder. p  pI also changed the name of one of the solutions to AllinOneTest.sln along with namespace and project files. p  pCan someone please help and point if I missed something obvious.p  pCheers, DS p
