Positive 11444 pI have elasticsearch running on a dev ubuntu EC2 instance.  I want to be able to use curator to take a snapshot of each days logstash and store that snapshot in an S3 bucket.  Everything works, except the snapshots are HUGE relative to the logstashes.p  pFor instance, according to du, the EC2s logstash2015.09.01 directory is 3KB, but the snapshot for that index on S3 is 93KB.  For larger ones, its even more pronounced logstash of 164KB becomes a whopping 305MB on S3  Ive verified that there is only a single node using this snapshot.  p  pIs this great embiggening an expected behavior  Any ideas on how to correct thisp

Positive 11444 pWe have images stored in the AWS S3 for our production services.br Is there any API which will allow to enable encryption on these existing resources without downloading and uploading again p  pI see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1464961howtocloneakeyinamazons3usingpythonandbotoBoto modulea in Python allows to clone the key with additional parameters e.g encryption, but this will create a new key. As these keys are stored in a separate database, we want to retain existing keys but just enable encryption.p

Negative 11444 pI have a site with multiple document libraries in it.  One of the site users has full control of the site amp at one point, instead of creating a new document library, they renamed the default document library from Shared Documents to Correspondence.  Now theyve opened the document library in windows explorer, so its added an entry into their network places.  The name of the entry was Shared Documents on portal.mydomain.net and not Correspondence on portal.mydomain.net.  This is because the address of the library is still Shared Documents.  I went into the users network places and renamed the entry, however I would prefer to have the address changed as well, so that future users do not run into the same problem.p  pI looked in the Document Library Settings but couldnt find a place to change the address there.

However, when I check off the Correspondence document library and pull down the actions menu, Move is greyed out.  p  pI emsupposeem that I could save the library as a template, include the content amp make a new library in the proper address, but then the modified by information would all be wrong.  p  pAny ideas p

So I want to knowp  p li What kind of toolslicenses will I need  Right now, we use Visual Studio and Smart Assembly to build, and Perforce for source control.  Will I need something else, or is there an equivalent of a cron job for running automated scripts li What, exactly, will this get me, other than an indication of a broken build  Should I set up test projects in this solution sln file that will be run by these scripts, so I can have particular functions tested  We have, at the moment, two such tests, because we havent had the time or frankly, the experience to make good unit tests. li What kind of hardware will I need for this li Once a build has been finished and tested, is it a common practice to put that build up on an ftp site or have some other way for internal access  The idea is that this machine makes emtheem build, and we all go to it, but can make debug builds if we have to.br  li How often should we make this kind of build li How is space managed  If we make nightly builds, should we keep around all the old builds, or start to ditch them after about a week or so li Is there anything else Im not seeing here p  pI realize that this is a very large topic, and Im just starting out.

Negative 11444 pMy ASP.NET application utilises a Modules system by using codeType.GetTypecode on a fullyqualified string reference, and instantiating an object of that type, as you do.p  pHowever, recently it has been throwing exceptions at not being able to find the types  but only occasionally.  I havent been able to replicate at will, but it usually happens after a simple change to something nonbinrelated like a Master Page or ASCX markup.  It doesnt sort itself until I rebuild the site or restart IIS.  Making a change to the web.config does not fix it.p  pAdding an explicit reference to the assembly in the web.config rather than making hoping it gets found sitting in the bin directory reduces the occurrence of the issue, but does not prevent it from happening entirely.  Somehow, something somewhere is thinking its a good idea to remove my assembly.p  pIve debugged into where it fails to find the type and right enough, despite being there on the previous page load, the assembly seems to disappear out of the codeThread.GetDomain.GetAssembliescode.  Clearly, I cant risk this happening when the application is live so I manually called codeAssembly.LoadAssemblycode on the DLL I knew it needed just to see if it would be worth creating a method that would try to locate the assembly.  This didnt work either, as it then threw the following error when I tried to use the classp  blockquote   p[A]xxx.Modules.CustomCaseStudy cannot   be cast to   [B]xxx.Modules.CustomCaseStudy.

Negative 11444 pI have a custom UINavigationController that supports autorotate.  I also have a UIDatePicker on one of my views that I throw onto the stack of the Navigation controller.  The autorotate works if I start the date picker view in portrait and then rotate it.  If I try load the date picker view in landscape to begin with, the view is all messed up. It looks like it would if it didnt support rotation and the frame only has about half of the picker visible and off center.p  pIve tried making my own date picker that supports autorotate in case that was the problem, Ive tried creating two different views and swapping them out, and Ive tried changing the view frame size on the ViewWillAppear method.

Negative 11444 pLong ago I created a small library for resizing images using imagemagick through codesystem...code because I did not feel that the buildin imagemagick functions for PHP were sufficient.p  pHowever, recently I had to port this to a symfony project and I chose to use sfThumbnailPlugin if I remember correctly.

That isnt helpful for the case I care about where Im using codetakePicturecode to take pictures programmatically.  I see that that the edited image is codekCGImageAlphaPremultipliedFirstcode but the original image is codekCGImageAlphaNoneSkipFirstcode.  p  pFurther update Jason Crawford suggested codeCGContextSetInterpolationQualitycontext, kCGInterpolationLowcode, which does in fact cut the time from about 1.5 sec to 1.3 sec, at a cost in image qualitybut thats still far from the speed the GPU should be capable ofp  pstrongLast update before the week runs outstrong user refulgentis did some profiling which seems to indicate that the 1.5 seconds is spent writing the captured camera image out to disk as a JPEG and then reading it back in.

Negative 11444 pShort version of the questionbr bDoes GET at a particular URI need to match what was PUT to that URIbp  pI think not.  Heres whyp  pGiven that a resource is an abstract thing that is theoretically unknowable by the client, when we do a PUT, we must be only sending a representation.  Based on combing over RFC2616, it doesnt seem entirely specified as to what that means for a resource that has many potentially infinite representations, but here are my thoughts please tell me if you agreep  pMy expectation is that if I PUT a representation to a resource, all other representations of the resource at that URI should be kept consistent potentially updated as necessary.  In other words, youre telling the resource use this representation to redefine yourself. p  pThus, I should be able to do thisp  blockquote   pPUT resourcesfoomyvacationbr   Contenttype imagejpgbr   ...  p blockquote  pAnd follow up with thisp  blockquote   pGET resourcesfoomyvacationbr   Accept imagepngbr   ...p blockquote  pand get the updated version of myvacation in a different format assuming the server knows how to do that.  Extrapolating from that, this composite atomic image  metadata PUT should also be legalp  blockquote   pPUT resourcesfoomyvacationbr   Contenttype multipartformdata  p      pContentdisposition formdata namedocumentbr   Contenttype imagejpgbr   [..]br   Contentdisposition formdata nameiptcbr   Contenttype applicationiptcbr   [..]br   Contentdisposition formdata nameexifbr   Contenttype applicationexifbr   [..]  p blockquote  pAnd then, because serverside content negotiation RFC2616 section 12.1 can take place based on just about anything, we can default to the document content for thisp  blockquote   pGET resourcesfoomyvacationbr   Contenttype imagejpgbr   [..]  p blockquote  por if you believe as I do that RFC 2396 section 3.4 The query component is a string of information to be interpreted by the resource. means that a URI with a query string refers to the same resource as a URI without a query string and is isomorphic with just sending applicationxformurlencoded data to the resource, then this should also be legalp  blockquote   pGET resourcesfoomyvacationcontentexifbr   Contenttype applicationexifbr   [..]  p blockquote  pThe description of PUT saysp  piThe PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied RequestURI.ip  pTo me, this is fairly antiREST, unless you read it in a very liberal manner.  My interpretation is The PUT method requests that a resource be created or updated at the supplied RequestURI based on the representation of the enclosed entity.p  pLater on, we getp  piThe fundamental difference between the POST and PUT requests is reflected in the different meaning of the RequestURI. The URI in a POST request identifies the resource that will handle the enclosed entity. That resource might be a dataaccepting process, a gateway to some other protocol, or a separate entity that accepts annotations. In contrast, the URI in a PUT request identifies the entity enclosed with the request  the user agent knows what URI is intended and the server MUST NOT attempt to apply the request to some other resource. ip  pWe need to similarly read this creatively, but the key bits here are knows what URI is intended and apply the request.p  pSo, to me the representation returned by GET at a given URI does not necessarily have to be the same representation that was PUT to the given URI, it just has to be consistent.p  pTrue or falsep

I tried most search engines but they have nothing close to what I need.p
Negative 11444 pI am doing a project on applets. I designed the applet using netbeans.

Negative 11444 pI received a complaint about buttons disappearing and odd formatting of a web application that I support.  Upon troubleshooting, it seemed that the only thing new about the environment which was previously working fine was the installation of webex on the client machine.  p  pUninstalling webex resolved the issue.  Please mind that strongwebex was not being used during the issuestrong, but it was still causing odd displays and formatting of Internet Explorer pages.p  pIve always disliked webex because it required reboot to use and the client felt very invasive gotomeeting can accomplish the same if not better features without being nearly as invasive.p  pOK, I guess the first few sentences were a frustrated rant.  The question is, what does webex do to mangle Internet Explorer pages even when webex is not actively being used.p  pExamples of the mangling are non appearing buttons completely overridden css and javascript errors when the app has no javascript errors.p

Moreover, the substitution only needs to be done once per application deployment, so repeatedly dynamically generating the stylesheets using JSP will be rather wasteful.p  pDoes anyone have any alternative ideas or tools to use for this Were committed to Tomcat and to substituting these parameters at deployment or at runtime that is, not at build time.p

Negative 11444 pNot even sure if this is feasible, but heres the use casep  pI have a RootView tableview that uses codeNSFetchedResultsControllercode to manage the list. I tap an add button, which presents the codeAdditionViewControllercode. The codeAdditionViewControllercode uses a separatecodemanagedObjectContextcode to create the new object. On Save, the object is passed back to the RootView, where the new object in the new codemanagedObjectContextcode is merged into the main codemanagedObjectContextcode. The codeAdditionViewControllercode is then dismissed, revealing the RootView.p  pWhat I would emlikeem to do, is to push my codeDetailViewControllercode with the new object loaded after the merge, so that when the codeAdditionViewControllercode is dismissed, the full detail view is revealed.p  pHow can I get the object that has just been added to the codefetchedResultsControllercode in order to pass it to the codeDetailViewControllercodep  h2UPDATEh2  pStill nothing on this. Let me try to explain what I need to do hopefully a bit better. If this is still confusing, ask questions. Im having a hard time thinking of how to describe the problem.p  pI am fully aware how to push the Detail view underneath the modal addition view upon saving the new object.  The problem is that the object I am saving is in its own codefetchedReaultsControllercode. I am merging this frc into the main codefetchedResultsControllercode, so if I try to sent the object to the detailview, I get a crash, because the object has been invalidated due to the merge by the time the modal addition view is dismissed, and the detailview calls codeviewWillAppearcode. That is what I am trying to get around. How can I figure out what object was just added to the main codefetchedResultsControllercode in order to send it to the detailViewControllerp  h2UPDATEh2  pAdding a bounty for anyone who can tell me how to retrieve the most recently added object from a fetched results controller. Or how to retrieve a specific object from a fetched results controller without knowing its indexPath.p

Negative 11444 pI have a low latency system that receives UDP messages.  Depending on the message, the system responds by sending out 0 to 5 messages.

Negative 11444 pGood morning all.p  pIm relatively new to the Visual Basic realm although a traditional web based script developer, ive come to ask you a question.  I am reading data from an XML file.  This local XML file will be updated by another application, and I will need to periodically reevaluate the XML file, and only import new data into a list box.  Furthermore, I want to be able to click on a particular item in the listbox, and display the other values about that particular XML entry.p  pSo, I suppose this is a multi part question.  What is the proper way to import only NEW data into the program, what is the proper way to store the data, and how do I associate a value in a listbox with the data stored elsewherep  pIve considered multidimensional arrays, but have been told that strings to char arrays and then back to strings is a terrible way to manage the data, but was never offered an alternative.p  pI will be satisfied with a list of topics to study up on andor an example for an answer to this question.p

Negative 11444 pDoes it make sense to create a service whose only responsibility is to send emails for other servicesp  pLet me try to express my doubts more clearly and give a little bit of context. BTW, you can ignore the term SOA if you like. My intent in including it was to communicate that I am talking about a distributed system that is partitioned by function. p  pThe reasons why I am uncertain as to whether an Email Service is appropriate or not arep  ol lipIt provides a technical function rather than an organization function. It doesnt compose the email messages, it just processes them. Would it make sense to have the Email Service compose the messages by responding to domain events Would this be beneficial or harmfulpli lipIt seems to introduce dependencies into all other services which utilize it. Particularly, I cant see how one could avoid RPCish interactions between the client and the Email Service. Even if you use messaging, the messages would be of the command style telling the Email Service to send an email which as I understand it are inappropriate for communications between services since they increase coupling due to the knowledge the client has to have about the service it is consuming in order for it to tell it what to do. Unless of course the Email Service composes the messages in response to domain events from other services see point 1.pli lipIt is questionable how much service it provides. In other words, isnt the SMTP server already the Email Service Of course, the custom Email Service might provide things like queuing and parsing of delivery reports. How much and what should be in the Email Service for it to really be necessarypli ol  pThe alternative would be to have each service within the organization be responsible for sending out its own email messages. However, this would mean that each service would have to be dependent on the SMTP server, but is that any different from being dependent on a custom Email Service It would also mean that each service would be responsible for queuing and delivery management. Is this beneficial or harmfulp  pIn addition, the email messages are considered domain entities, meaning that the organization is interested in the messages themselves in addition to the events that initiated them and the information that they carried. This means that users will be interested in viewing the messages that were sent out within context. For example you might look at a customers account and ask to view the messages that were sent to that customer these messages might include account created confirmation, order placed confirmation, order shipped notification, experience feedback request, etc..p  pI apologize if my question makes certain assumptions or is unclear, but based on what Ive written, can anyone suggest an approach or discuss an approach that they have taken and how it worked out Ive already looked around SO for similar questions and googled on the topic but did not find anything that really applied, but if anyone can point out any resources I would greatly appreciate it. I would also be interested in answers that point out things that I might be overlooking or misunderstanding. Any sort of discussion on the matter seems valuable to me.p

Negative 11444 pWeve implemented an audiovideo collaboration application on top of Silverlight, and are trying to tune it.  One of the issues were experiencing is an increase in stream latency whenever a packet is dropped we have to wait for the packet loss to be detected, requested, and then for the lost packet to be resent.  Of course, this plays hell with the consistency of our audio stream.  Wed switch over to UDP if we could, but Silverlight doesnt support that inbrowser.  Weve also disabled the Nagle algorithm, so in general, as soon as we submit a byte[] array to be transmitted, its transmitted, and in a single packet.  Im aware that TCP packet size  amount of data submitted, but with the Nagle algorithm disabled, its close.  And we have an adaptive jitter buffer, so we emcanem deal with lost packets, but a lost packet over TCPIP massively increases the amount of audio we need to buffer, and hence latency.p  pSo were trying to optimize how we send our packets, to see if theres any way to reduce the impact of dropped packets.  We currently have several competing solutions that were thinking about implementingp  p1 We could try to make our packets larger.  Currently, we send a mix of large 1024 byte video packets and small 70 byte audio packets over the same TCP stream.  But we could multiplex the audio and video data together, i.e., by attaching some of our video data to our audio packets whenever theres room.  This would make the individual packets somewhat larger, but would cut down on the total number of packets.p  p2 We could split the audio and video into two separate TCP streams.  This means that if the video stream stalled because of a lost packet, the audio stream wouldnt stall, and vice versa.  Of course, it would slightly increase the overhead, and wouldnt cut down on the overall number of packets sent.p  p3 We could inverse multiplex the audio into multiple separate TCP streams, and then reassemble them on the far side.  This would effectively allow us to fake a single UDP style of packet delivery.  If we had 8 audio streams, and one of them stalled because of a lost packet, the other streams would still be able to deliver their data on time, and all wed have to do is deal with 18 of the audio packets being unavailable until the stalled stream caught back up.  Thats not ideal, of course, but it might result in a better experience than to have the entire stream stall, and not being able to play emanyem packets until the lost packet is retransmitted.p  pAny thoughts on any of these possibilities Any other suggestions  Or do we just need to code up all three, and then test themp

I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observeramp8212excellent for drawing the veil from menamp8217s motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own highpower lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory. ltpgt  I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each other. My own complete happiness, and the homecentred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings of his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion. ltpgt  One nightamp8212it was on the twentieth of March, 1888amp8212I was returning from a journey to a patient for I had now returned to civil practice, when my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the wellremembered door, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drugcreated dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.             ltdivgt          ltdivgt      ltbodygt  lthtmlgt codepre

Negative 11444 pI understand there are many questions related to this, so Ill be very specific. I create Console application with two instructions. Create a List with some large capacity and fill it with sample data, and then clear that List or make it equal to null. What I want to know is if there is a way for me to knowmeasureprofile while debugging or not, if the actual memory used by the application after the list was cleared and nulled is about the same as before the list was created and populated. I know for sure that the application has disposed of the information and the GC has finished collecting, but can I know for sure how much memory my application would consume after this I understand that during the process of filling the list, a lot of memory is allocated and after its been cleared that memory may become available to other process if it needs it, but is it possible to measure the real memory consumed by the application at the end Thanksp  pEdit OK, here is my real scenario and objective. I work on a WPF application that works with large amounts of data read through USB device. At some point, the application allocates about 700 MB of memory to store all the List data, which it parses, analyzes and then writes to the filesystem. When I write the data to the filesystem, I clear all the Lists and dispose all collections that previously held the large data, so I can do another data processing. I want to know that I wont run into performance issues or eventually use up all memory. Im fine with my program using a lot of memory, but Im not fine with it using it all after few USB processings. How can I go around controlling this Are memory or process profilers used in case like this Simply using Task Manager, I see my application taking up 800 MB of memory, but after I clear the collections, the memory stays the same. I understand this wont go down unless windows needs it, so I was wondering if I can know for sure that the memory is cleared and free to be used by my application or windowsp

Negative 11444 pWe are new to sharepoint and creating a sharepoint 2010 environment. The first project is a site with 23 different workflows. We have created the site with the workflows in our development environment using SharePoint Designer.

Negative 11444 pheres the situation.p  pIn a Java Web App i was assigned to mantain, ive been asked to improve the general response time for the stress tests during QA. This web app doesnt use a database, since it was supposed to be light and simple. And i cant change that decisionp  pTo persist configuration, ive found that everytime you make a change to it, a general object containing lists of config objects is serialized to a file. p  pUsing Jmeter ive found that in the given test case, there are 2 requests taking up the most of the time. Both these requests add or change some configuration objects. Since the access to the file must be sinchronized, when many users are changing config, the file must be fully written several times in a few seconds, and requests are waiting for the file writing to happen.p  pI have thought that all these serializations are not necessary at all, since we are rewriting the most of the objects again and again, the changes in every request are to one single object, but the file is written as a whole every time. p  pSo, is there a way to reduce the number of real file writes but still guarantee that all changes are eventually serializedp  pAny suggestions appreciatedp

Negative 11444 pOK, so this may be an odd situation but please bear with me.p  pI have a Python program which calls up a C class via a SWIG interface. I came to a point where I must asynchronously signal to update a status the Python code from the C library. Originally I had inefficient busy loops which polled a flag. I wanted to replace this by using codeSIGUSR1code.p  pSo, the problem is I discovered that even though these are separate threads, they share the same PID. That is the Python and C program both report the same PID. I have sent the signal using codekillcode, and the Python code caught it in its handler, however it did not interrupt the code as I expected. I tried two methods of waiting for the signal in the Python code, first py calling Pythons codesignal.pausecode which I read was supposed to be preempted on the reception of a signal. The other one was a simple codetime.sleepcode which was supposed to do basically the same thing  return when the signal comes through.p  pFor some reason this isnt working  my C code sends the signal, the Python code receives it and calls the handler, however, the pausesleep calls never return.p  pIf it is possible to correctly signal the same process, how would you do itp  pand if this is just dumb forgive me and move onp

Negative 11444 h1General Problemh1  pI have some objects that have some variables that are not known at creation time.p  pRight now I create these objects and gradually fill them until they are fully instantiated.

These tasks have some variables that are known when I create them, and some variables that only become known when the task is being scheduled. Right now I create these tasks with the variables that are known, and when the task is ready for scheduling I call emscheduleTaskTask tem and this method will set the variables that become known when the task is being scheduled.p  pBut is it a good solution to create objects that are not fully instantiated, and set the remaining variables when they become knownp  pI was thinking about deferring the task creation until all variables are known when it is being scheduled. But some taks can only be scheduled after getting an approval from external sources.p  pDoes somebody have some design ideas on how to solve this problemp  pemEDITem I forgot to mention that I have different types of Tasks that all inherit from Task.p  pemEDIT 2em How about ProposedTask objects that have the variables that are known before scheduling References to these can be hold until it gets approval.

There are lots of pages for lots of different entities, but the GUI components can and should be made as generic as possible as to not violate DRY. The example code is obviously the filter textfield and button part of the page.p  pEDIT II  I want this component to be even more loosely coupled if possible, e.g. make it able to do completely different things, not just modifying a params object say, e.g. have another case where I need to update TWO params objects, then I wont be able to use this panel. The onSubmit method in the form as it is now requires a reference to the objects to be used in the overriden method are known beforehand. Is there any way to not have it that way or set the presence andor types of those objects dynamicallyp  pEDIT III The point is that this panels core function really is only to allow the user to p  ul lienter a stringli linotify and give access to that string to some other part of the system when the user clicks the button.li ul  pWhat that other part of the system does with the string should not really have to concern this panel, but as it is now, it is coupled to the params object upon which the other part of the system must perform some operation. It is this coupling I would like to get rid of if possible. I might as well want to use the string from this panel for just printing to console or use it for some other arbitrary task.p

Negative 11444 pIve got a question about something I dont understand that is going on in my FPGA project.  I need to control two devices AGC and ADC through an SPI bus.  As as the FPGA will be the master device, Im generating a clock signal, strongSCKstrong, in code by dividing the system clock.  I then rout that signal to an output wire through a tristate buffer.  Below is my relevant bit of code.  Its not shown, but the signal that controls the tristate buffer, strongenSCKstrong controlled by a FSM, when it is set low in the idle state and then high for the rest of the states.p  precodeoutput wire SDI     for SCKclock reg SCKgen, SCKhold integer i reg enSCK wire negedgeSCK     SCKgenerator     always posedge clk             begin                 i lt i1                 SCKhold lt SCKgen                     ifi  10                         begin                             SCKgen lt SCKgen                             i lt 0                         end             end   assign SCK  enSCK  SCKgen  1bz codepre  pWhen I get implement the design i get the following warningp  pstrongWARNINGPhysDesignRules372  Gated clock. Clock net enSCKnot0001 is sourced    by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to    control the loading of data into the flipflop.strongp  pAlso I notice my clock seems very distorted.  But if I dont use the tristate device in my code and direclty assign the clock signal to the output wire as in the code below I get a nice clean clock signal.p  precodeassign SCK  SCKgen codepre  pBelow is a side by side of the signal strongSCKstrong without the tristate buffer left and with the tristate buffer right.  Im fairly new to FPGA and Verilog, but my understanding is that using that style of assign code implies a tristate buffer, so Im confused why it seems to be interpreted as a gated clock source The XST generated schematic shows it implimented with an strongandstrong gate.  Im also confused about how its distorting the clock signal.  The FSM should be forcing the strongenSCKstrong enable signal high for many times the period of the clock so Im not sure whats happening. Also according to the demo board manual, other devices share this signal so I have to set it to high impedance when its not in use.  If someone could point me in the right direction, or explain it to me Id be very great full.  Thanks img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comJlzai.jpg altenter image description herep

Negative 11444 pImagine an enormous 3D grid procedurally defined, and potentially infinite at the very least, 106 coordinates per side.  At each grid coordinate, theres a primitive e.g., a sphere, a box, or some other simple, easily mathematically defined function.p  pI need an algorithm to intersect a ray, with origin outside the grid and direction entering it, against the grids elements.  I.e., the ray might travel halfway through this huge grid, and then hit a primitive.  Because of the scope of the grid, an iterative method [EDIT such as ray marching ]is unacceptably slow.  What I need is some closedform [EDIT emconstant timeem ]solution for finding the primitive hit.p  pOne possible approach Ive thought of is to determine the amount the ray emwouldem converge each time step toward the primitives on each of the eight coordinates surrounding a grid cell in some modular arithmetic space in each of x, y, and z, then divide by the rays direction and take the smallest distance.  I have no evidence other than intuition to think this might work, and Google is unhelpful intersecting a grid means intersecting the grids emfacesem.p  pNotesp  ul liI really only care about the surface normal of the primitive I could easily find that given a distance to intersection, but I dont care about the distance per se.li liThe type of primitive intersected isnt important at this point.  Ideally, it would be a box.  Second choice, sphere.  However, Im assuming that whatever algorithm is used might be generalizable to other primitives, and if worst comes to worst, it doesnt really matter for this application anyway.li ul  pThanks,br Ianp

Negative 11444 pI would like to use a single codeWizardViewControllercode with different codeinputViewcode subviews. The codeWizardViewControllercode would share a codesearchCriteriacode and pass it along to each new step, with each step adding to the criteria depending on the input for that particular codeinputViewcode.p  pThe problem I am facing is how to structure my objectsviews so that I can reuse codeWizardViewControllercode accepting different types of inputcontrols. For example, Ive thought of using a codeWizardViewModelcode that had members like codeenum wizardViewModelTypecode for each type of view, codeUIView inputViewcode that corresponds to each type of codeWizardViewModelTypecode, and creating custom codeUIViewcode subclasses that correspond to the different possible codeinputViewcodes that would be needed, connecting outlets as necessary in Interface Builder. The problem is that I believe that going down this road will lead to a lot of interclass dependencies and basically defeat the purpose of separating the codeinputViewcode logic from the codeWizardViewControllercode. Furthermore some of the codeinputViewcode will require me to grab possible values from a web service, which is something that the codeViewModelcode will have to handle, further breaking the logic. Perhaps I need separate codeViewControllercode for each type of input view Or am I thinking about this in entirely the wrong wayp

Negative 11444 pIm trying to implement a change auditing system at the context level using EF4 database first. Im overriding codeSaveChangescode and capturing entities that have a state of codeAddedcode, codeDeletedcode, or codeModifiedcode from the contexts codeObjectStateManagercode. This normally works, but Ive encountered an issue where none of the entities have this state including entities that I have changed in code, but the context emdoesem have changes to the database. Ive gone so far as to look at the list of entries with codeUnchangedcode as the state, and my modified entity is in that list.p  pThe only complication that I can see is that Im using selftracking entities as this is a WCF service that ordinarily sends these STEs down to the client for changes, then the client passes the modified STEs back up to persist the changes. strongWhat seems to be happening is that objects that are retrieved on the server and modified directly there rather than being passed to the client and using the STEs codeObjectChangeTrackercode are not being marked as codeModifiedcodestrong. Is this normalexpected behavior If this is the case, then clearly the context is using something emotherem than the codeObjectStateManagercode to determine what changes to persist to the database, as the changes emareem being made.p  pHow can I detect these changes and keep track of them Does anyone know what it is that the context is using to track changes I had always assumed it was the codeObjectStateManagercode, but that seems not to be the case.p

Negative 11444 pI would like to match up PDB files from the Protein Databank to canonical AA sequences for the protein as displayed in Cosmic or Uniprot. Specifically, what I need to do is pull from the pdb file, the carbon alpha atoms in the backbone and their xyz positions. I also need to pull their actual order in the proteins sequence. For structure 3GFT Kras  Uniprot Accession Number P01116, this is easy, I can just take the ResSeq number. However, for some other proteins, I cant figure out how this is possible.p  pFor example, for structure 2ZHQ protein F2  Uniprot Accession Number P00734, the Seqres has the ResSeq numbers repeated for numbers 1 and 14 and only differs in the Icode entry. Further the icode entries are not in lexographic order so its hard to tell what order to extract. p  pIt gets even worse if you consider structure 3V5Q Uniprot Accession Number Q16288. For most of the protein, the ResSeq number matches the actual amino acid from a source like COSMIC or UNIPROT. Howver after Position 711, it jumps to position 730. When looking at REMARK 465 the missing atoms, it shows that for chain A , 726729 are missing. However after matching it up to the protein, those AA actually are 712715. p  pIve attached code that works fro the simple 3GFT example but if someone is an expert in pdb files and can help me get the rest of it figured out, I would be much obliged.p  precodelibrarygdata  answerlt get.positionshttpwww.pdb.orgpdbfiles2ZHQ.pdb,L answerlt get.positionshttpwww.pdb.orgpdbfiles3GFT.pdb,A   This function reads a pdb file and returns the appropriate data structure get.positions lt functionsourcefile, chainrequired  A N lt 105 AACount lt 0 positions  data.frameResiduerepNA, N,AtomCountrep0, N,SideChainrepNA, N,XCoordrep0, N,YCoordrep0, N,ZCoordrep0, N,stringsAsFactorsFALSE       visited  list filedata lt readLinessourcefile, n 1 fori in 1 lengthfiledata input  filedata[i] id  substrinput,1,4 ifid  ATOM   type  substrinput,14,15   iftype  CA     resSerial  strtoisubstrinput, 7,11     residue  substrinput,18,20     typeofchain  substrinput,22,22     resSeq  strtoisubstrinput, 23,26     altLoc  substrinput,17,17      ifresSeq gt1 does not include negative residues       iftypeofchain  chainrequired ampamp resSerial in visited  ampamp altLoc     altLoc  A          visited lt cvisited, resSerial         AACount lt AACount  1         positionstring list         positionstring[[1]] as.numericsubstrinput,31,38         positionstring[[2]] as.numericsubstrinput,39,46         positionstring[[3]] as.numericsubstrinput,47,54         printinput         positions[AACount,]lt cresidue, resSeq, typeofchain, positionstring[[1]], positionstring[[2]], positionstring[[3]]                        positionsltpositions[1AACount,]   positions[,2]lt as.numericpositions[,2]   positions[,4]lt as.numericpositions[,4]   positions[,5]lt as.numericpositions[,5]   positions[,6]lt as.numericpositions[,6]   return positions  codepre

Negative 11444 pI have services that need to be created on a perconfiguration base, each of which relies on an external resource and thus should manage its own lifcycle i.e. deregister the service. Thus implementing these as DS and let SCR spawn multiple instances does not work.p  pOne can implement a bundle that registers a ManagedServiceFactory to accomplish this task perfectly see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11832204howdoyouimplementamanagedservicefactoryinosgimy previous posta. But as a consequence, if the factory depends on several other services, you need to start tracking those services and write a lot of glue code to get everything running. Instead Id like to implement the factory as singleton declarative service, for which the SCR registers a codeManagedServiceFactorycode at the Service Registry.p  pHeres my attemptp  precodeimport org.osgi.framework.BundleContext import org.osgi.framework.ServiceRegistration import org.osgi.service.cm.ConfigurationException import org.osgi.service.cm.ManagedServiceFactory import org.osgi.service.component.ComponentContext  SuppressWarnings rawtypes, unchecked  public class Factory implements ManagedServiceFactory   private BundleContext bundleCtxt private MapltString, ServiceRegistrationgt services  public void activateComponentContext context throws Exception      System.out.printlnactiavting...     this.bundleCtxt  context.getBundleContext     services  new HashMapltString, ServiceRegistrationgt   public void deactivateComponentContext context      forServiceRegistration reg  services.values          System.out.printlnderegister   reg         reg.unregister          services.clear   Override public String getName      System.out.printlnreturning factory name     return my.project.servicefactory    Override public void updatedString pid, Dictionary properties         throws ConfigurationException      System.out.printlnretrieved update for pid   pid     ServiceRegistration reg  services.getpid     if reg  null          services.putpid, bundleCtxt.registerServiceServiceInterface.class,                 new Service, properties      else           i should to some update here        Override public void deletedString pid      ServiceRegistration reg  services.getpid     if reg  null          reg.unregister         services.removepid        codepre  pand the service descriptionp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gt ltscrcomponent xmlnsscrhttpwww.osgi.orgxmlnsscrv1.1.0 configurationpolicyignore namemy.project.servicefactorygt    ltimplementation classmy.project.factory.Factorygt    ltservicegt       ltprovide interfaceorg.osgi.service.cm.ManagedServiceFactorygt    ltservicegt    ltproperty nameservice.pid typeString valuemy.project.servicefactorygt ltscrcomponentgt codepre  pI already found out that the factory property in the service description is the wrong path, because this way the component is never registerd as codeManagedServiceFactorycode in the Service Registry, instead it becomes a codeComponentFactorycode.p  pAs a kind of hack, I just added a component property, namelyp  precodeltproperty nameservice.pid typeString valuemy.project.servicefactorygt codepre  pand added codeconfigurationpolicyignorecode. This works configurations named codemy.project.servicefactoryfoobar.cfgcode are handed to my service, which registers them as in the Service Registry, everything fine.p  pBut theres two things about it i do not likep  ol limanually setting the property codeservice.pidcode feels like a dirty hack to meli lisetting codeconfigurationpolicyignorecode prevents me from configuring the codeManagedServiceFactorycode itsself. If I escape this property or set it to require, I would get one codeManagedServiceFactorycode for a configuration named codemy.project.servicefactory.cfgcode and then two services for each configuration named with the pattern codemy.project.servicefactoryfoobar.cfgcode one codeManagedServiceFactorycode that the SCR spawns and one codeServiceInterfacecode that my first codeManagedServiceFactorycode registers when it gets notified about this new configuration. At least this is not growing exponetially because SCR overwrites the codeservice.pidcode property for factory configurationsli ol  pSo how should I set this up properlyp  pPS For those wondering about my reference to configurations on their filenames I use Felix Fileinstall for the configurations, thus codefoo.cfgcode is put to the ConfigAdmin for PID codefoocode, and codefoobar.cfgcode is put there for emfactoryempid codefoocode.p

Negative 11444 pI am building a web service following the REST architechture style. I am using JAXRS to make it easier.

Now, I have seen some web service APIs that exposes path such as codeapprovedcode or codequestionsapprovedcode. The approved part of the path seems more like attributes that the questions may have in this case and I wonder if this is ok, and where the boundry goes between making it a request parameter and a part of the path like thisp  pAnd is it ok to expose paths in the web service that in some way exposes one of the intended resources in your system like in this case codeQuestioncode, but through a path like codeapprovedcode in addition to the normal codequestionscode path What are the rules, and how is this supposed to be p  pIf I did not have anyone to ask I would have created a path like codequestionstypeapprovedcode  GET. p  pBecause approved is not a resource in my system.

I was trying to set up everything in terms of the devversion of my facebookapp, except for my object page, which, as I understand it, needs to be publicly accessible to scrape the OG metatags.p  pI made a testpage for my custom object, copied the autogenerated set of OG metatags into it citing the devversion of my appid, but with the public URL of the prodversion of my app for ogurl  Then, I used the facebook lint tool on that testpage, and it, I guess not surprisingly, complained about that public domain being invalid for the relevant app the devversion of my facebook app.p  precodeObject Base Domain Not Allowed Object at URL  httpfoo.herokuapp.comtestEventPage.php of type fooproduct is  invalid because the domain foo.herokuapp.com is not allowed  for the specified application id the appid. codepre  pThen, I learned about using Tunnlr to portforward from a public site to my local env and proceeded to get that set up.p  pIm using MAMP with a virtual host config as followsp  precodeltVirtualHost 8888gt   DocumentRoot the relevant docroot   ServerName foo.local   SetEnv FACEBOOKAPPID my dev FB appid   SetEnv FACEBOOKSECRET my dev FB secret ltVirtualHostgt codepre  pAnd Im using tunnlr, with the cmdln for it pointing to port 8888.p  pUsing the public URL provided by Tunnlr, I am successful in accessing my local pages, but, when I try to use the Login button on the page that came with the example PHPcode from Facebook, the logindialog pops up but immediately disappears, though when accessing it directly locally it works fine.p  pCould this be cookierelated  Something to do with portforwarding and cookiesp  pIs there a better way to develop Facebook apps, in particular ones involving custom Open Graph actions and objectsp  pEDIT like the doctor said, if it hurts when you move your arm like that, dont move your arm like that  In other words, access the TunnlrURL via the FacebookCanvas URL, which POSTs the embedding pages current login to your own page and, as a user optionally a testuser, dont use the examplecodes loginbutton instead use the embedding pages loginfeature.

Negative 11444 pWe have an old application that was written in Delphi 7.  It is currently connected to an old Oracle Lite database that is being retired.  The powers that be have chosen to move the data to a Microsoft SQL Server Compact database instead.  After sepending a good amount of time moving everything over to the SQL CE database, I am now tasked with getting the Delphi application to play nice with the new databases.p  pThe people who are supposed to be smarter than I am my boss, tell me that I should be able to simply modify the connection and everything should be back in order.

Ive tried several different versions of the connection string and a couple different ways of trying to query the data, but it all ends up the same.

Negative 11444 pI have created a website in Symfony2 using website.comlocalexxxxxxxx routing to translate static data into two languages. This implementation works successfully but I wish to go further than that. I want to run this website for several other countries and a proper transformation is necessary in order to have those countries with different languages managed into one website. p  pLets say I have an entity for Shops. Each object created has some variables like Address, kind of business, equipment etc. This allows the user to create an entry in his own language but all entries will be mixed in the table. The table will have italian, english, spanish data and when someone enters the website from a different location, we unfortunately have to view the other languages data. p  pI want the user to have the ability to create a new Shop in two languages English and his own. The solutions I have thought of arep  ul liI will create a new column in the same table for example originallanguage and every entry will be stored with a locale enUS, esSP etc. When the website wants to retrieve a row will search through ONE table will thousands of entries.li liI will create another table which will be the mirror of the original one, in another language. This means that I will have a Shops tableentity, a Shopsit, a Shopses, a Shopsbr etc. Unfortunately this solution will need me to create several tables and relationships between other linked tables.li liI will create another column in the same row for each field. The Shops.description, Shops.address etc. will also include Shops.descriptionen, Shops.descriptionbr, Shops.addressen, Shops.addressbr etc. li ul  pWhat is the safest, quickest and more professional way to do what I want p

Negative 11444 pWhy are there two different Writertype monads in Haskell Intuitively to me, reading strict writer monad means that the codeltgtcode is strict, so that theres no thunk buildup in the log. However, looking at the source code, it turns out that that isnt the casep  pre classlanghs prettyprintoverridecode Lazy Writer instance Monoid w, Monad m gt Monad WriterT w m where  ... m gtgt k   WriterT  do     a, w  lt runWriterT m     b, w lt runWriterT k a     return b, w ltgt w codepre  pIn the strict version the patterns arent irrefutable, i.e. the codecode are missing. So what happens above is that codemcode and codek acode are not evaluated, but stored as thunks. In the strict version, they are evaluated to check whether they match the tuple patterns, the result is fed to codeltgtcode. In both cases, the codegtgtcode isnt evaluated until something actually demands the resulting value. So the way I understand it is that both the lazy and strict versions do the same thing, except that they have the thunk in a different place inside the definition of codegtgtcode lazy produces coderunWriterTcode thunks, strict produces codeltgtcode thunks.p  pThis leaves me with two questionsp  ol liIs the above right, or do I misunderstand evaluation hereli liCan I accomplish strict codeltgtcode without writing my own wrapper and instanceli ol

Negative 11444 pI am attempting to start an intent on my MainActivity class after receiving an entry from an EditText field.  I pass some data with extras.  In my MainActivity I check to see if there are any extras from an Intent.  If so I process the data in an asynchronous task.  The problem is that my MainActivity goes through the process twice of checking for the extras from an Intent and eventually the program bombs.  It is very confusing and I will show below how the program flows.  First below is the initiation of the intent in another activity below the MainActivity.p  precode   thisLocation  EditText findViewByIdR.id.restlocation          thisLocation.setOnKeyListenernew View.OnKeyListener              public boolean onKeyView v, int keyCode, KeyEvent event                  ifkeyCode  KeyEvent.KEYCODEDPADCENTER                           keyCode  KeyEvent.KEYCODEENTER                      String location  thisLocation.getText.toString                     Log.dLocation in key listener, location                     try                                          ListltAddressgt foundGeocode  null                      foundGeocode  new GeocodergetApplicationContext.getFromLocationNamelocation, 1                     double  newlat  foundGeocode.get0.getLatitude getting latitude                     double  newlng  foundGeocode.get0.getLongitudegetting longitude                     Log.dLat in key listener, String.valueOfnewlat                     Intent intent  new IntentgetApplicationContext, MainActivity.class                     intent.addFlagsIntent.FLAGACTIVITYCLEARTOP                     intent.putExtralat, String.valueOflat                     intent.putExtralng, String.valueOflng                     startActivityintent                                            catch IOException e                          Log.eGeocode, String.valueOfe                           return true          return false       codepre  pI can tell from my logs that the processing goes through the above routine twice before going to the MainActivity.

I am using the example directly from their page to set the custom dialog, but it is not using the jQuery Dialog, it still uses the browsers native dialogp  precode.DirtyForms.dialog       selector unsavedChanges,     fire functionmessage, dlgTitle          unsavedChanges.dialogtitle dlgTitle, width 350, modal true         unsavedChanges.htmlmessage     ,     bind function          unsavedChanges.dialogoption, buttons,             [                                      text Stay Here,                     click functione                          .DirtyForms.choiceContinue  false                         this.dialogclose                                      ,                                      text Leave This Page,                     click functione                          .DirtyForms.choiceContinue  true                         this.dialogclose                                                   ]          .binddialogclose, functione               Execute the choice after the modal dialog closes             .DirtyForms.choiceCommite              ,     refire functioncontent          return false     ,     stash function          return false       codepre  pWith the plugins debugging turned on, I receive no errors or any other JS errors, but the modal dialog doesnt fire, only the browsers native one. Other implemented jQuery UI Dialogs on the same page work. Im not sure what I may be missing here. Any help or insight would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 11444 pI am analyzing data collected on bird behavior and want to calculate the amount of time a seabird remains on the surface of the water while loafing, otherwise considered resting, between foraging dives diving under the water to pursue fish.

I need to first evaluate the dataframe so that I am only considering the behaviors of the individual birds. To do this I need to make sure that the id number directly below the row I am considering is the same. I then need to isolate the times when the bird is loafing indicated by l in the database. I then want to make sure that it dove indicated by d both before and after the loafing period. By doing this I am ensuring that I am not counting the times when the bird is just happily floating on the water as loafing between dives as they may do this for hours at a time after they are full.p  pIdeally this would run in a for loop or some other expression allowing me to run through all 4,000 plus rows of data at once creating a vector of loafing l times that I can then use to calculate mean, sd, etc. on.p  pAny tips on how to accomplish thisp

Negative 11444 pAs part of a puppet apply provisioning setup I need to change the owner group and permissions on directory recursively. This is pretty easy to do with puppets file typep  precode    file  appRoot       ensure gt directory,       recurse gt true,       owner gt whoever,       group gt thegroup,      codepre  pThe problem is that there are tens of thousands of files in this directory, and puppets notice logging output writes out to the console or log file three times for each file, notifying that it successfully changed the owner, group, and mode. This leads to unusably large output logs and Id like to suppress this output unless there was an error.p  pIn the exec type there is an option to do this, logoutput  onfailure or false, but I cant seem to find any way to do this with file. It seems like doing much or anything in exec is frowned upon in the puppet world, is there any other way to customize the logging on the file operation short of moving it to an execp

Negative 11444 pAt the moment I have a server that will allow clients to connect to it by sending a message connect, when the server receives this message, it takes in the InetAddress, and then uses that InetAddress to send data to the client, once the client is connected and receives its ID number, it will constantly send data to the UDP socket so it can update its position, now when a new client wants to connect, it will send a message connect but only very rarely the new client will connect, What is happening is the client that is already connected is keeping the host.receive function busy, so when the new client goes to connect, it is lucky if the current client connected doesnt jump in the way, and then the client is just left with a blank screen.p  pWhat I need help with is, how

Negative 11444 pCurrently I have two servers set up, each handling there own thing, but I want to have a unified login between them. Right now one portals login form is simply sending the usernamepass through an API to the Rails portal, and it sends back an auth token, which we then store in our session and use for future authentication and API calls.p  pSo the problem becomes that a user visiting our site has to login once in each portal, since the Ruby API doesnt communicate with ours, and the Ruby side doesnt do anything with the session when the API is pinged but send us back and auth token.p  pMy initial idea was to have the Rails side create the session when we send the credentials to the API, but apparently that wont work as they wont be able to set the session id in the users browser, or at least thats what I was told.p  pIf the Ruby side moved over to using the database for session storage, would that alleviate this issue Basically, I want to keep most of the changes on the Ruby side for this.p

Hitting [AltH] starts the script but nothing typed is echoed back.  Even hitting [CrlD] doesnt end it.

Calling codestty cookedcode and codestty echocode at the beginning of prompting, then codestty sanecode or codestty rawcode afterward triggers a new cascade of problems mostly relating to how bound characters are handled, but suffice it to say that it destroys most alt bindings and more until return has been hit a couple times.p

This way, if the user selectes 4 copies then presses add the GUI will be refreshed and when it comes back the list can repopulate with its showingdefault value now set to 4 instead of 1 so the user will not have to reselect 4 another time.p

Negative 11444 pI am creating an OpenGL game that will use texture atlases to load a lot of artwork.p  pTexture atlases are good because you load your image once and then cut sprites out of it. You save the time that would be necessary to load all files from disk, if they were independent and you save memory to store the images. But in my mind, beyond a certain point this benefit will not be that true, right My idea is that if the texture atlas is very huge, you will waste a lot of memory to store it and perhaps some of the sprites on it will not be used that frequently.p  pWhat is the best approach for that divide in multiple sprites a sprite for level or whatp  pAnyway, my question is this what is the size in pixels that corresponds the maximum an atlas should have to be considered a benefitp

Negative 11444 pWe have a unified portal which links multiple services through a jQuery tab based interface making use of iframes to display content from different services. Our portal runs on a secure server with HTTPSSSL. While most of our external services are HTTPS, two of them arent. Obviously we are aware of the issues with mixed content and we didnt like the idea of having nonhttps sites within the portal, but we didnt have a choice. Everything was ok until a few days ago when Google updated chrome to version 30, which now silently blocks mixed content.This has created a great number of problems for us. We contacted the external services  and asked them if they could upgrade their services to HTTPS and one of them has come back saying they have no plans to do so for the next 2 years.p  pObviously this is a problem. We tried getting around the problem by getting this service to open into a new browser window, but this is a rather inelegant workaround which I would like to get rid of, if at all possible. Is there any way that I can use AJAX or PHP to prefetch the page in question and then display it within the portal iframe without Chrome blocking itp  pI would be very grateful for any advice at all. I do understand how bad an idea it is to mix secure content with non secure content, but I have no choice in the matter as my manager is adamant that the service have to be a part of the portal.p  pThanks in advance.p  pRegardsp  pAlexp

Negative 11444 pThis is a homework question.p  pI have the following problem I need to create a system that can simulate the way a landlord taxes or charges a tenant, according to the type of landlord and the type of tenant. The landlord can be a Low Class landlord manages a crappy apartment building, a Middle Class landlord manages a soso building and a High Class landlord manages a topclass building. The tenant can be an Irresponsible tenant pays with several months of delay or a Responsible tenant pays on time.p  pThere is a fixed tariff according to the kind of landlord, and theres a penalty or a benefit given according to the kind of tenant and the kind of landlord an Irresponsible tenant will be charged extra, and the Responsible will be given some bonus for paying early or whatever, but this only applies if he lives in a building managed by a High Class landlord or a Middle Class landlord. Tenant is supposed to have an attribute that stores the money it has to pay in rent.p  pI diagrammed this problem this wayp  ul liA Landlord abstract class, with the following concrete classes that inherit from it High Class, Low Class and Middle Class.li liA Tenant abstract class, with Irresponsible and Responsible concrete descendants.li ul  pMy problem is how do I implement a method to charge the tenant I proposed the following the Landlord class defines a virtual method called chargeTheTenant, that takes a parameter of class Tenant and charges it according to the type of tenant it is. The problem is that for this Id have to use reflection to find out what kind of Tenant the Landlord class has, and Im told I have to try not to use reflection, and that I should search for design patterns to solve this.p  pWhat design pattern I should look into to avoid using reflection in this casep  pThanksp

Negative 11444 pWe have a MySQL slow query killer that kills process IDs after a specified number of seconds passes and that works fine. However wed like in our notifications to also see the full query that was being so slow. p  pThe problem is that while codemysqladmin v processlistgrep processidcode should work, it truncates queries that have newlines in them e.g.p  precodeSELECT  FROM table WHERE xy    ... stuff  codepre  pHere stuff will be cut off and the query thusly truncated. I realize that that may not be syntactically correct as Im not a DBA, but I just wanted to give an example of the kind of query flow we sometimes have to deal with in our applications please dont complain about the format, it wasnt my decision nor is it under my control. p  pDoing a query in codeinformationschemacode would solve this, I believe, but the team does not want to do this due to the performance impact queries against that database often involve.

Negative 11444 pLately I have been having difficulties with constructors, and the different attempts from other questions and guides always have some form of segfault waiting for me at runtime making compiling 80 of my time spent programming.p  pThe following example shows the basic idea on what I am trying to accomplishp  precodestruct Coord3     float x, y, z     Coord3 x0y0z0Is this Correct   struct Stat     int Str,Dex,Int     StatStr0Dex0Int0   struct Item     Stat myStats     Item...   class SimpleChar     public to keep things simple for now     Coord3 pos     Stat myStats     int level     float health     Item inventory[20]      SimpleChar     level0     health100     What happens with pos, inventory and myStats in this classs constructor   int main     SimpleChar myChar     ifmyChar.inventory[0].getNULL...this caused the most recent SEGFAULT as mentioned below. Why wouldnt this work  codepre  pWith this example I have a bunch of simpler structs similar to codeCoord3code and codeStatcode. These structs are at the base level of my engine, and are used accordingly to make higher level structs, then those are used to make the highest level structs such as codeItemcode being item related information and codeSimpleCharcode having generic RPG character statistics, like an inventory and stats. The errors I get are so different according to the situation that it was difficult to keep track them all, but the most interesting one was a SEGFAULT onp  pcodeifitemSet.inventory[a].getNULL Note this is originally a sharedptr AND was in a struct known as ItemSet, which held all item informationcodep  pSo basically what I ask isp  ol liWhen are the default constructors invokedli liWhen the constructors are used, do they also invoke their members constructorsli liWhat would be the correct way to declare these members both in the classes and codemaincodeli liWhat is the correct way to create the constructorli ol  pEDIT The code has been spruced up for anyone that is way too obsessed with if the code is valid by syntax instead of actually answering the question.p  pEDIT 2 Since the SEGFAULTs are not created from constructor format then I ask if it is possible to get a SEGFAULT if an instance variable is too large in size I mainly ask this because recently I have changed a class member to a pointer instead of an object and it worked fine.p
Negative 11444 pI have a database that I have been working with in Visual Studio 2012.

Negative 11444 pI have a program which uses an Android device as an interface to another PICbased system.  The Android has two modes of operation  in one, it gives an HMIstyle display showing the status of the connected system in the other, it acts as a dumb terminal allowing me to program and alter the monitored system.  img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comD2iHZ.jpg altempty terminal screenp  pI am using a fragment to handle the terminal activities.  This has a TextView showing the past history of entered text and responses, with another TextView allowing me to enter a command line. On first starting the program and accessing the terminal display, touching the text entry TextView brings up the keyboard, with the other two TextViews moving up the display to make room for it.  This is what I want.  img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comXiNvH.jpg altterminal screen with keyboard  as requiredp  pI can access the HMI display by saving the FragmentInstanceState and then using fragTrans.hide.  If I then return to the terminal fragment and start reentering text, the keyboard now overlays the two TextViews, which hides the text entry box. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comLwNr2.jpg altenter image description herep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com7uLc2.jpg altenter image description here The only difference in the two modes is that on reentering the fragment I use fragTrans.show to display the terminal mode when first starting, I use fragTrans.add.p  pAnother change between the first use of the terminal and subsequent accesses is that the button I use to access the terminal is initially overlaid, but appears above the keypad later.p  pIs this issue due to differences between the fragment.show and fragment.add functions, or is there another aspect I am missingp

Negative 11444 pIn MATLAB, I did lossless predictive coding of standard images by predicting the next sample from previous samples, subtracting the predicted value from the actual one, and encoding the error using Huffman coding. I decoded the errors as well, but now I have an array of errors without knowing how to go back to the original image. How do I predict the values of the original image matrix from these errorsp  pJust in case this helps, my predictor is of different types to see which one gives the best result, with X being the actual value of a sample  1 I take three neighboring values of X, find their average, and subtract them from X to obtain the error. 2 I used the predictor AB2, where A and B are neighboring values of X, and subtract from X.p  pAnd others like that. Theres a pretty comprehensive list out there.p  pAny advice on how to predict the original values at the decoderp

Ive gotten to the point of trying to debug this by throwing bricks at the issue but still havent root caused it. At the current moment the class that the cstring resides in does nothing but initialize its private string members and set a pointer to another class to NULL.p  pInterestingly if I do not set the class pointer to NULL and comment out that line the corruption goes away. I think this is somewhat of a red herring, and that something is changing in the way the compiler is putting the code together when it pulls in the .h file that contains theCLog definitions and that would be used since Im declaring a pointer to that object.p  precode    int tmainint argc, TCHAR argv[]       DWORD a  0xBABA just to help catch the corrupter     DWORD b  0xDFDF      CStringW startat  Lanetworksharefre     CStringW lookfor  L.inf      DirEnum myEnumstartat,lookfor      ULONG en  a  b      en  a  b      return 0   DirEnum.cpp   DirEnumDirEnumCString startingdir,CString fileFilter      mplogfile  NULL  If you comment out this line corruption goes away     mstartingdir  L     mextfilter  L      ifstartingdir.GetLength gt 0         mstartingdir  startingdir      iffileFilter.GetLength gt 0         mextfilter  fileFilter      following commented out to tshoot     CLogBaseamp ref  ref.GetInstance     logBase  ampref      mplogfile  new CLogLDirEnumerator,Llogfile.txt,logINFO   codepre  pNow I suspect that something in the log.h file is causing a change to occuur in the ATL or CString libraries but I dont know what.

Negative 11444 pI would like to integrate my web system with card payment processing terminals. Within the system there is a payment module with the expenses of the client. If the client choose to pay with a debitcredit card, himher will physically swipe their debitcredit card and follow the payment process.

This is the first issue that I do not know how to resolve, because to get my site working with heroku again it also uses heroku, like my sample app will need to use process.env.PORT instead of a statically assigned port number. p  pSecond, I had to change the line in publicmain.jsp  precode var socket  io.connect codepre  ptop  precode var socket  io.connecthttplocalhost3000 codepre  pbecause I was having an error stating p  precode httplocalhost5000socket.io1t1398462814085 404 Not Found  error.  codepre  pThird and last I had to change the line in viewschat.jadep  precode scriptsrcsocket.iosocket.io.js codepre  ptop  precode scriptsrchttplocalhost3000socket.iosocket.io.js codepre  pbecause I was having an error stating p  precode Uncaught ReferenceError require is not defined   Uncaught ReferenceError io is not defined  codepre  pNow with these changes, the app works just fine locally, on p  precode httplocalhost3000.  codepre  pBut Im trying to get this back onto the Cedar stack of Heroku.

How long will the device remember the information I have stored in the array p  pThe property is declared and set in a viewController that is embedded in a navigationViewController that is itself the first view controller in a TabBarViewController. In other words its the first view the user sees then they may navigate away from it and back. p  pWithout getting into a debate over atomic vs nonatomic my question is thisp  pstrongDoes a property declared either way lives on infinitely in the iOS environment or is its lifespan  limited by factors such as time, memory usage elsewhere, turning off the device, etcstrongp  hr  pstrongTo avoid this being an x y problem heres why Im askingstrongp  pIm working on an app that includes a menu broken up into multiple categories with several items in each category .....as you might expect a menu to be. All of the menu items are stored on parse.com. At first I was doing a separate PFQuery on each page, one on the categories page to get the categories, when user selects a category a new page is pushed  and a second PFQuery got all the items in the chosen category. This worked but the pages took quite a while to load, probably 1015 seconds sometimes with no real indication that the app hadnt just frozen up.p  pTo fix this I decided to run one PFQuery when the first view of the app is loaded in codeviewDidLoadcode getting all of the menu items and sorting the myself into nested arrays of categories containing items. I then store the menu array in a property on the viewController. Later, when I go to the menu I have the below in its codeviewDidLoadcodep  precodeget e reference to the first view controller, the one that has the menu array  FirstViewController myVC1ref  FirstViewController [[[self.navigationController.tabBarController.viewControllers objectAtIndex0] viewControllers]  objectAtIndex0]  set thisviewControllers menuArr property to point to the menuArr on the first viewController.  menuArrmyVC1ref.menuArr codepre  pMy understanding is that this creates a pointer to the original array and does not actually create a second array please correct me if Im wrong. p  pThis method takes about 1015 seconds to load and sort the array that one time but then navigation between pages is instant after that which is much better.p  pI plan to do queries in places to see if any menu items have been changed and if so redownload and sort the menu. p  pSo far in my testing the app seems to remember the info in the array just fine throughout the day with normal unrelated phone usage but there has to be some limits to that rightp

Negative 11444 pstrongQuestion backgroundstrongbr Hello everyone, I have been developing windows form application for my employer for about 3 years. Though most of my works are amateurish. Ive been using visual studio, c, enjoying creating reusable windows form controls by subclassing and other techniques. Now my boss want me to make website for this company, the first thinking in my mind is to create reusable WEB controls just like windors form application.p  pstrongThe methods I have triedstrongbrp  ol lipstrongWeb User Controlstrong, At very first, I found visual studio support developer to create codeWeb User Controlcode, with file extension as .ascx. I was very exciting to find this because I thought I can create Web controls just like I did in windows form application development. BUT, its a very big BUT, I then found that it cannot be embed to assembly file DLL, and either can it be displayed in ToolBox to support drag and drop in web page design time. AFAIK from msdn, the codeWeb User Controlcode is not intended to be reused across projects. So I give up this method.pli lipstrongServer Controlstrong, then I found there is codeCustom Server Controlcode can be created to support assembly embed and ToolBox. Its a .cs file that written with a class which subclassing from codeSystem.Web.UI.WebControls.WebControlcode or codeSystem.Web.UI.WebControls.CompositeControlcode. Good point is that this is exactly what I want reusability and designtime support. HOWEVER, the huge disadvantage is that it doesnt support dragdrop when creating the web control itself. The control can only be rendered by html written in c or be created by code. And I have to embed cssjavascript to the control if I want to create more beautiful, complicated or efficient control. Anyway, from MSDN, codeServer Controlcode is what I need.pli lipstrongPure HTML, Javascript jQuery, CSSstrong, actually Ive beening working with codeServer Controlcode method for a while, just in order to make my boss happy. But I still cannot stop thinking about other better solutions. From my understanding, web page is not that complicated, its simply constructed please correct me if Im wrong by codeHTML tagcode, codejavascript or other scripting languagecode, codeCSS to manipulate UIcode. So I believe if I create web control by pure Html, Javascript and CSS, it will be of course more complicated but more compatible. Because codeServer Controlcode solution requires the web server support .Net Framework, which is not free and limited to Microsoft scope. If I have a way to get rid of .Net, why NOT Im willing to spend doubletime to create ReUsable control if its worthy to do. For example, if I want to turn to PHP to create web page, I might have to acquire the technique to create my web control simply by HTML, Javascript and CSS.pli ol  pstrongMy questionstrongbrp  ol lipSpeaking all of the above, is it even possible to create my web control library only based on Html, Javascript and CSS pli lipIf so, is there any tutorial about this methodpli lipI really would like to know that how does commercialprofessional company create web page.pli ol  pThank you everyone, any advice will be very much appreciatedp

Negative 11444 pTwo questions about problems Im having writing up a BASH script that uses variables. I cannot for the life of me figure this out and it is KILLING me.p  p1 I have the following code.   p  precodepdirmediaTheEnforcerICADougParticipantsRS1 cd pdir  for subject in   do     subdirpdirsubject      cd subdir      subj echo subject  head c9     3dAFNItoNIFTI prefix ICAcleanRSNIIsubj RSFCLFFrallsubjorig      cd pdir  done codepre  psubject is a subject ID which is .results. For example 1R101U1A.results. Basically my code cds me into that directory in which is a file called RSFCLFFrall1R101U1Aorig which I want to process via the code line that starts with 3dAFNItoNIFTI. Obviously I cant use subject variable in that code line because it would attempt to find the file RSFCLFFrall1R101U1A.resultsorig which does not exist. So to fix this I made a new variable called subj which, via the echo pipeline, basically cuts off the last 9 letters of subject which, in effect, removes the .results. When I do this and echo subj it gives me 1R101U1A which is exactly what I want. p  pHowever, the line of code that starts with 3dAFNItoNIFTI errors with the followingp  precodeFATAL ERROR Cant open dataset RSFCLFFrallorig codepre  pI have tried declaring the subj variable like, five different ways including using head, tail, cut, and colons and I still get this error.

As you can see, I separate the tress and trunks into different lists and return the length. However, l can contain other leafs and trunks that are not getting counted. Notice this is not recursive. Ive been thinking of trying to use continuation but I dont know how to do so. Any suggestions pleasep

Negative 11444 pI have a table of about 700 items no duplicates that is taken from a big table where data is being added on every day. All of these items in the first mentioned table occur more then once in the big table, so I have added a count next to the second table to see how many times one item is mentioned in the big file.

Negative 11444 pI currently have a working twobroker JDBC MasterSlave configuration, and the next step for me is to implement a scheduler with failover. Ive looked around and havent seen any information about this, and was curious to see if this is possible or if I should try a different approach. p  pCurrently, I have the two brokers using the same dataDirectory both within the broker tag and the JDBCPersistenceAdapter tag. However, within that data directory ActiveMQ creates two separate scheduler folders. I cannot seem to force it to use the same one, so failover with scheduling isnt working. p  pIve also tried the KahaDB approach with the same criteria, and that doesnt seem to work either. p  pAnother option would be for the scheduler information to be pushed to the database in this case, oracle and be able to be picked up from there not sure if possible. p  pHere is a basic overview of what I need p  ol liMaster and slave brokers up and running, using same dataDirectory lets say, broker1 and broker2li liIf I send a request to process messages through master at a certain time and master fails, slave should be able to pick up the scheduler information from master this is where Im stuck li liSlave should be processing these messages at the scheduled timeli ol  pactivemq.xml relevant partsp  precodeltbroker xmlnshttpactivemq.apache.orgschemacore brokerNameb1 useJmxtrue     persistenttrue schedulerSupporttruegt  lt kahaDB persistenceAdapter gt  ltpersistenceAdaptergt     ltkahaDB directoryactivemq.datakahadb enableIndexWriteAsyncfalse      ignoreMissingJournalfilestrue checkForCorruptJournalFilestrue     checksumJournalFilestruegt  ltpersistenceAdaptergt  lt JDBC persistenceAdapter gt  ltpersistenceAdaptergt     ltjdbcPersistenceAdapter dataDirectoryactivemq.data dataSourceoracledsgt ltpersistenceAdaptergt codepre  pCan someone possibly point me in the right direction Im fairly new to ActiveMQ.

Negative 11444 pIm trying to do an internationalized website, with an URL prefix for each language I translated eg. codefrmypagecode or codeitmypagecode.p  pI tried JMSI18nRoutingBundle and it works pretty good with almost no additional configuration. But I really want to determine automatically the user preferred language. The users favorite languages are transmitted into the codeAcceptLanguagecode HTTP header, and I want to choose the first language I have a translation for.p  pHere is my JMSI18nRouting configp  precodejmsi18nrouting     defaultlocale en     locales [fr, en]     strategy prefixexceptdefault codepre  pI want this type of behaviourp  pcodehttpmywebsite.commypagecode do an automatic language detection then a redirection to codexx...code where codexxcode is the user favorite language because language is not specified in URL  Presently the default language is EN.p  pcodehttpmywebsite.comXXmypagecode shows the page in XX language  Presently, works fine.p  pAny idea to do this  Is the config OK p  pOh, and, if anyone has a solution to do the same thing in pure Symfony without JMSI18nRoutingBundle, my ears are widely open.p  pstrongEDIT  Found a way to have intelligent redirections with JMSI18nRoutingBundle to respect users favorite language or let user force the display of a language.

Negative 11444 pI was provided with an algorithm that would help me solve the following problemp  pTake an codeNxNcode grid. Start at the top left and traverse to the bottom right only going down or right from each node. For examplep  pcodegrid  [[0,2,5],[1,1,3],[2,1,1]]codep  pImagine this list as a gridp  precode0 2 5 1 1 3 2 1 1 codepre  pEach number you visit you have to add to the running total. In this case there are six different ways to get to the bottom that provide you with a total sum. The algorithm I was given that would work for this and return a list of possible sums is as followsp  precodedef gridsumsgrid, x, y, memo if memo[x][y] is not None     return memo[x][y]  if x  0 and y  0     sums  [0] elif x  0     sums  gridsumsgrid, x, y1, memo elif y  0     sums  gridsumsgrid, x1, y, memo else     sums  gridsumsgrid, x1, y, memo  gridsumsgrid, x, y1, memo  sums  [grid[x][y]  s for s in sums] memo[x][y]  sums return sums  def gridsumsfastgrid memo  [] for row in grid     memo.append[]     for cell in row         memo[1].appendNone  return gridsumsgrid, lengrid[0]  1, lengrid  1, memo codepre  pIndentation is not correct but you get the idea. This works however for a much larger value of N, it does not work well at all. For example up to a N value of 20, it takes to long and on some tests I ran it times out.p  pObviously there is a lot of repeat work being done by the main function so how exactly can I implement memoizationdynamic programming with this algorithm The work is repeated a lot of times giving me grounds to say dynamic programming needs to be implemented however the line codesum  [grid[x][y]  s for s in sums]code trips me up because codexcode and codeycode change for each value so I would only have to commit the previous sums into a memo however I cannot quite wrap my head around doing so.p  pAny guidance in the right direction is appreciated, thank you.p

Negative 11444 pUsing iOS 8 and Xcode 6, I have created an universal MasterDetail app using the template.  p  pWhen run on an iPad, it tries to display both master and detail views side by side.  In this app having them both on the screen is a big nuisance.  How do I get the iPad to open to the master view and segue to the detail view just as if it was an iPhonep  pFurther motivation for this there is a collection view in the detail view and it misbehaves when the split view controller tries to load it.p  pAny insights you offer are much appreciated.p

Negative 11444 pI am going to explain the path that led me to asking this question on the chance that I am going about this wrong the lack of Google answers to help me are a good indicator that this might be possible. p  pI am writing functional tests for my projects API endpoints. I want my tests to clean up after themselves, this is problematic because when I create a test user with a POST. There is no corresponding DELETE. So I created a log file that lists the IDs of all of the users created.p  pNow I am attempting to create a stored procedure or SQL event that reads the IDs from the log file and then removes them from the Database. This seems like it shouldnt be difficult, but I cannot find anything online that would let me even know how to start. The LOAD DATA INFILE commands Ive seen all want me to create a table. Cant I just read each line from a file without needing to create a new table in my database p

Negative 11444 pWhen exposing different API versions how do you handle storing and retrieving data that might have different structuresp  pLets say we have two API versions V1 and V2. V1 and V2 both have a POST endpoint at a hrefhttpsapi.commessage relnofollowhttpsapi.commessagea which will create a message in the database based on the passed data likep  precode     DOB 20141201  codepre  pIn V1, the data required is different from V2 because in V2 we decide to change DOB from a string with the format YYYYMMDD to an integer timestamp e.g. 1284723728323p  pIn this case when we save data from a call with the V2 API the DOB field will be an integer but when saving from a call to V1 it will be a string in a very different format.p  pWith each iteration of the API we might modify many aspects of the underlying data. Calling older API versions will result in the stored data being incorrect for other versions of the API.p  pIs there an elegant way to deal with different API versions requiring data in different formats  structuresp

Negative 11444 pwere using DevCenter 1.2.0 and from the DataStax web site the below does not seem to be adressed by 1.2.1.p  pDevCenter 1.2.0 forces an implicit limit on select... queries, which allows values up to 1000, and cannot be empty. The limit value from the limit box can be overridden by an explicit LIMIT clause. p  pThis works fine when running standard queries, but makes it impossible to get a valid result for select countem queries. This is because in Cassandra the LIMIT clause applies to the source rather than the result unlike SQL btw. So if you do select countem from mytable in DevCenter, you will get a result of 100 if the current limit is 100, 200 if the current limit is 200 and so on. Pretty useless Im afraid.p  pIf you override the limit by doing select count from mytable limit 1000000000000 then you get a timeout.p  pWould it make sense to remove the implicit limit for select count queries in DevCenterp

This too indicates that the crash is due to something in the background which I cannot control.pli lipIf I clean up the cache manifest so that it only contains a single or a few small files, then it seems to work without crashing most of the time. p  pSo, maybe the crash has something to do with downloading large files or downloading many files into the caching infrastructure.p  pI havent been able to pinpoint anything here. It just works occasionally when I have few files in the manifest, and never when I have many.pli lipI havent found anything useful by Googling. It seems as if were the first to experience this problem .pli lipIt works when hosting the app on another server not on our production server. This probably explains why nobody else have reported this.p  pI havent been able to determine why it doesnt work on our production server but do work on a test server. Ive tried to make the test server behave just like the production server but havent been able to make the error occur anywhere but on the production server.   pli ol  pIve spent quite some time with this problem now and Im currently leaning towards working around it by letting our server respond with HTTP 404 or something when the code.appcachecode resource is requested from Safari checking the UserAgent request header.p  pI would really appriciate it if someone could shed any light on thisp

Sorry for my initial mistake in the example above I do this for every time step and then sort this vector of pairs with codestdsortcode.p  pThe idea was now to use the sorted vector of pairs  of time step codej1code lets call it codevectorOldcode in time step codejcode as a presorter for the new codemyVectorcode since I assume the ordering of the sorted new codemyVectorcode of time step codejcode will only differ in some cases from the already sorted codevectorOldcode of time step codej1code.p  pWith presorter I mean to rearrange the pairs in the new codemyVectorcode into a vector codepresortedVectorcode of type codemyVectorTypecode  by the same index order as the codevectorOldcode and then let a tim sort or some similar sorting algorithm that is good in presorted date do the rest of the sorting.p  pSome data examples  This is what the beginning of codemyVectorcode looks like in time step codej1code before the sorting.p  precode0.0688015 0 0.0832928 1 0.0482259 2 0.142874 3 0.314859 4 0.332909 5 ... codepre  pAnd after the sortingp  precode0.000102207 23836 0.000107378 256594 0.00010781 51300 0.000109315 95454 0.000109792 102172 ... codepre  pSo I in the next time step codejcode this is my codevectorOldcode and I  like to take the element with index code23836code of the new codemyVectorcode and put it in the first place of the codepresortedVectorcode, element with index code256594code should be the second element in codepresortedVectorcode and so on. But the elements have to keep their original index. So code256594code will not be index code0code but only element 0 in codepresortedVectorcode still with index code256594codep  pI hope this is a better explanation of my plan.p

Negative 11444 pI use MapProxy to convert a WMTS Layer to a WMS Layer. I need to do that because my client software can handle WMS only I have a configuration which is working but there is a problem with the zoomlevels or the resolution. I have set up MapProxy with my configuration. I open then the demo site at localhost8080demo. Here I can view an OpenLayers map for the original WMTS Layer and the result of my convertion MapProxy dose a nice job here.p  pWhen I view the OpenLayer map of the original WMTS layer I can easily read all the labels for cities and streets. When I look at the map of the WMS layer its hard to read these labels. The map doesnt appear sharp and the font size is too small. Furthermore its obvious that the zoom levels for the OpenLayer WMS and WMTS maps are different. It seems that the tiles for the WMS layer are shrinked.p  pHas someone a explanation for that behaviour Is that a problem of MapProxy or a OpenLayers problem Or is it just a constraint of the WMS specificationp  pSome additional informations The WMTS capabilities of the layer I try convert is available here a hrefhttpwww.basemap.atwmts1.0.0WMTSCapabilities.xml relnofollowhttpwww.basemap.atwmts1.0.0WMTSCapabilities.xmlap  pA screenshot which shows the problem.

Negative 11444 pWeve got some testing infrastructure reliant on the AppDomain DomainUnload event being fired. Some of which will be loading up Selenium Web Drivers i.e. indirectly firefox.p  pHowever our ninject setup seems to be stopping DomainUnload event being fired, it loads up a singleton to be injected into transient instances. Unfortunately there are too many moving cogs to post a concise example, so Im looking for debugging techniques in general.p  pWhen using a static class to contain the Selenium work it seems ok, but when injecting it with ninject DomainUnload isnt fired.p  pThere doesnt seem to be too many ways to get a hold of AppDomain info.p  pIve been looking at a hrefhttpdevdale.blogspot.co.uk200710gettinglistofloadedappdomains.html relnofollowhttpdevdale.blogspot.co.uk200710gettinglistofloadedappdomains.htmla p  pWhat sort of things would cause the DomainUnload event not to be fired What sort of debugging techniques could I usep  pIve read a little about finalizers and unmanaged code causing problems, but I wasnt sure how this could be applicable for ninject.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com2KTLw.png altenter image description herep

Negative 11444 pIm trying to extra the name of a module from some verilog code. For examplep  precodemodule uart inputs, outputs, etc codepre  pI know I can use pythons slicing to get a substring, but that only uses indexes.

Negative 11444 pIm having a problem about suspendresume instance. Theoretically, as I suspend a vm, it will save the vms state at that time, and upon resumption, vm is exactly as it was before entering suspending. However, in OpenStack Juno verrsion, when I resume, it does not return to previous state, which looks like the vm boot from start and requires login usernamepassword.

Negative 11444 pIm running into a small issue while trying to loop asynchronous events. In my case I was trying to shorten the amount of typing done to send 5 different AJAX request to the server, where as the only difference in the request is an ID which should always be 15.p  pBelow is my code showing this, please note that I am using AngularJS so Im using their post method. p  precodefunction loopRequesthttp, destination      forvar i  1 i lt 6 i           Attempt to preserve the value of i throughout the asynchronous call         var tmp  i           http.posthttplocalhosttest.php, slot tmp.successfunctiondata              console.logAJAX call completed for ID   tmp                codepre  pThe result of this execution is the followingp  precodeAJAX call completed for ID 5 AJAX call completed for ID 5 AJAX call completed for ID 5 AJAX call completed for ID 5 AJAX call completed for ID 5 codepre  pObviously I could send the identification number back with the AJAX call however I dont want to do that and would rather understand what the issue is here before continuing. I understand that the array is continuing before the asynchronous function completes, however in java defining a temporary variable like done above would stay in scope for the remainder of the arrays cycle and be used by the asynchrnous call. Apparently that doesnt work here.p  pWhat should I be doing I could just write out 5 different calls here, but the idea was to eliminate the need to do so. p

Negative 11444 pIm having an issue with the following code, and I fail to understand where is the problem. The problem is occurring however only with V2 intel processor and not V3. Consider the following code in Cp  precodestruct Tuple   sizet a    sizet b    sizet c    sizet d    sizet e    sizet f    sizet g    sizet h    void derefATupleamp aTuple, const sizetamp aIdx    aTuple.a  A[aIdx]   void derefABTupleamp aTuple, const sizetamp aIdx    aTuple.a  A[aIdx]   aTuple.b  B[aIdx]   void derefABCTupleamp aTuple, const sizetamp aIdx    aTuple.a  A[aIdx]   aTuple.b  B[aIdx]   aTuple.c  C[aIdx]   ....  void derefABCDEFGTupleamp aTuple, const sizetamp aIdx    aTuple.a  A[aIdx]   aTuple.b  B[aIdx]   aTuple.c  C[aIdx]   aTuple.d  D[aIdx]   aTuple.e  E[aIdx]   aTuple.f  F[aIdx]   aTuple.g  G[aIdx]  codepre  pNote that strongA, B, C, ..., Gstrong are simple arrays declared globally. Arrays are filled with integers.p  pThe methods strongderefstrong, simply assign some values from arrays accessed via index  emaIdxem to the given struct parameter emaTupleem. I first start by assigning to a single field of the given struct as parameter, and continue all the way to all fields. That is, each method assigns one more field than the previous one.  The methods deref are called with index aIdx starting from 0, to MAX size of the arrays arrays have the same size by the way. The index is used to access array elements, as shown in the code  pretty simple.p  pNow, consider the graph a hrefhttpdocdro.idAUSil1f relnofollowhttpdocdro.idAUSil1fa, which depicts the performance for array sizes starting with 20 million sizet  8 bytes integers, up to 24 m xaxes denote the arrays size.p  pFor arrays with 21 million integers sizet, the performance degrades for the methods touching at least 5 different arrays i.e., derefACDE...G, therefore you will see peaks in the graph. The performance then improves again for arrays with 22 m integers and onwards. Im wondering why this is happening for array size of 21 m only This is happening only when Im testing on a server with CPU  IntelR XeonR CPU E52690 v2  3.00GHz, but not with Haswell, i.e., v3. Clearly this is a known issue to Intel and has been resolved, but I dont know what it is, and how to improve the code for v2.p  pI would highly appreciate any hint from your side.p

Negative 11444 pIve recently started developing a simple webpage with a submit form on it. Initially, I approached it using HTML, CSS and a jQuery bootstrap to animate my elements timepickers, datepickers, dropdowns and file uploaders. Then I realised that I wanted to make my form a multistep form using Angular.br Everything went well, and I managed to follow a tutorial to change my form and inject different views into it by using an Angular app. However, none of the Javascripts that are loaded into my index page are working any more since they get loaded on DOM ready, before the Angular.br I read up on different ways to get around this by creating Angular directives to emulate jQuery elements.br I was wondering what the correct approach to solving this is. It seems quite often people suggest not using a mixture of jQuery and Angular. Is there any way to load the javascripts after Angular has finished putting everything in or is this bad practice and should be avoidedp

Negative 11444 pWe develop against a local instance of Oracle XE.

This usually means that the connection to the database failed. Check that the connection string is correct and that the appropriate DbContext constructor is being used to specify it or find it in the applications config file. See a hrefhttpgo.microsoft.comfwlinkLinkId386386 relnofollowhttpgo.microsoft.comfwlinkLinkId386386a for information on DbContext and connections.

Negative 11444 pIm building a fairly simple gazebased control system. There is a terrain with pointsofinterest markers scattered about. By gazing at the markers the user initiates a series of Move actions that will use the physics engine to move the user to the new pointofinterest marker. One of the parts of the experience creating some sense of presence is the way the camera lifts and drops with the undulations of the terrain, so physics is important part of the experience Im creating.p  pPreviously, I built this experience in Oculus and just used the OVRPlayerController. But now Im moving over to Cardboard, and the Unity PlayerController seems to come with a lot of unnecessary baggage for my purposes.p  pIf my requirements are limited to the experience described above, are there any reasons to not simply create a Capsule object with a collider and set CardboardMain as a child of that, rather then include all the crap associated with Unity PlayerControllerp

However, this can take some time and so I slapped together a tool in Excel. a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comccmGG.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comccmGG.png altThe interface for the IBD comparison toolwhat I don39t wish to use.ap  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.com6eV8K.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com6eV8K.png altMy current solutionap  hr  h2Old Methodology, roughlyh2  ol liScraped 169 user IDs from 23andMe list of connected family membersli liPut cleaned up data in Excel, in one long listli liSplit list of 169 values down into 5 BF columns, each with 33 valuesli liInserted formula codeA1code into cells A2 through A34 so that area will always reflect the current focusedupon user ID in A1li liPut into G2 this formula codehttpswww.23andme.comyoulabsmultiibdtabledefaultid1ampA2ampampdefaultid2ampB2ampampdefaultid3ampC2ampampdefaultid4ampD2ampampdefaultid5ampE2ampampdefaultid6ampF2code li liDragged down that cell so that the other relevant cells in Column F had that formulali liCopied the generated URLs into a batch URL opener in Chrome.li ol  pNote that the old methodp  ul liHad no affordances for namesli lirequires me to redo the columns when more values are added andli liwill create one URL out of every batch that has the focusedupon ID as a comparedto ID, which will cause an error.li ul  h2Proposed Methodologyh2  pUse Ruby, including the Shoes package, to create a small program that can load and edit a CSV file with the first and last names of the users as well as their numeric IDs.p  pFunctions include     loading a CSV file with extant data easy, know how to do     adding a nameID pair to the CSV file easy, know how to do     combining and appending to the IDs such that each of the IDs is compared to every other ID aside from itself, in batches of 5.p  pNote that the 23andMe tool allows for an ID to be compared to less than 5 other IDs, so there is no issue for the remainder.p
Negative 11444 pI am trying to plot points and hence connect these points usingp  precode gl.drawArraysgl.LINESTRIP, 0, points.length codepre  pConnecting these points together would give me a full shape, a polygon maybe. The problem is for the points plotted, the lines are broken. I understand the difference between gl.LINES and gl.LINESTRIP using the latter would finish off the polygonal shape by connecting all of the vertices lying next to each other. p  pI somehow think that using gl.LINES would be the best option, because using gl.LINESTRIP not only connects the verticespoints together but also connects the end point of one shape with the start point of the next shape since it draws lines between 2 adjacent points. I would certainly not want that and would want to draw individual shapes.p  pSecondly, I tried using index buffers. This did not work out too, because my code would not know how many vertices are needed for each shape before handsince each shape is a haphazard shape. p  pI would want to draw many such shapes in a single draw call. So my best guess is  to use a single drawArray call that uses gl.LINESTRIP and say that for each shape, draw the shape in an opaque color and for the line that connects the end point of the first shape to the start point of the next shape, make it transparent colored. This way, I would get individual shapes drawn. But I am confused to make this work. How would I tell that the shapes have a different color and the extra lines have a different colorp  pHere is an excerpt from my codep  precodebuffer  gl.createBuffer gl.bindBuffergl.ARRAYBUFFER, buffer gl.bufferDatagl.ARRAYBUFFER, points, gl.STATICDRAW   enable the points attribute in the shader to receive buffer var attributeLoc  gl.getAttribLocationpointProgram, points gl.enableVertexAttribArrayattributeLoc   tell webgl how buffer is laid out pairs of x,y coords gl.vertexAttribPointerattributeLoc, 2, gl.FLOAT, false, 0, 0 codepre  pThe remaining shader linking and compiling is the same boilerplate code.p  pMy drawArrays looks like thisp  precode gl.lineWidth7  gl.drawArraysgl.LINESTRIP, 0, points.length  codepre  pI tried using a color buffer like thisp  precode  var colorBuffer  gl.createBuffer   gl.bindBuffergl.ARRAYBUFFER, colorBuffer   var colors  [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, this is for the shapes                 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.3] this is for the extra lines, to make them transparent   gl.bufferDatagl.ARRAYBUFFER, new Float32Arraycolors, gl.STATICDRAW   var aVertexColor  gl.getAttribLocationpointProgram, aVertexColor  gl.enableVertexAttribArrayaVertexColor  gl.vertexAttribPointeraVertexColor, 2, gl.FLOAT, false, 0, 0 codepre  pThis did not somehow seem to work.

Negative 11444 pThere seems to have no way to enforce uniqueness in Parse. I have a parse object in which one of the fields is a url. I require that url to be unique as it is the most important field in the object everything else is meta data about it. So is there a way to override the objectId of a Parse Object That way I can always check for existence in a simple way before trying to create the object.p  pActually this might still fail. So any ideas that do not include cloud codep  pI know this can be done because Parse is able to ensure username and email are unique for each User object. I am hoping its an elegant solution and someone here knows how I might accomplish something similar. After all, database tables with unique fields are commonplace. p

Negative 11444 pOne of Parses brutal Achilles heel is the fact that you cannot save videos to the database their 10MB limit means videos less than 30 seconds long. And so to supplement Parse, I am using the Cloudinary Parse Module. But now I have a problem. Normally, Parse takes care of strongeventuallystrong saving data to the cloud, allowing users to upload data even while offline. Is there a way to get Parse and Cloudinary to accomplish this without me myself having to depend a Job Queue such as codecompile com.pathandroidpriorityjobqueue1.1.2codep
