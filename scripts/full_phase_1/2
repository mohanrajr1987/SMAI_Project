Positive 2 pIm dealing with a rare bug using Chrome 45 Windows only. When I resize the web browser, suddenly the html tag gets the width and height value on auto, then the page gets blank all html code is there, but invisible I dont get it, dont understand how or why those values are set in auto.p  pMy tests has been using IE, FireFox, Chrome also Canary, Opera on Windows Safari, Chrome 45 on Mac, Edge on Windows 10 the only browser that sets that value is Chrome 45 on Windows, the other browsers just sets the values on  pxp  pChrome seems doesnt like pages with higher 800px width values, so sets the value in auto.p  pAny ideas Thanks in advance.p  pRodp

Positive 2 pThe code Im working with is too long to post, so Ive made a fiddle here a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netEmily925b72k225 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netEmily925b72k225ap  pThis code takes a random image and cuts it up into a number of pieces depending on the class that is applied in the div which contains the image.p  pWhen the page loads, a random image is selected from the array and the class is applied to it, what Im trying to do is create a separate div, which when clicked on will reload the div containing the image. The result Im looking for is for the image to be replaced by a new random image with the class applied to it. p  pRight now, the only way I can make a new image appear in the div is to reload the entire page, ideally this would be achieved by just having the div reload instead of all the other page elements reloading too.p  pI havent been able to do this so far but have received some help on here on how to reload an image and class on click of a div, lines 9801018 of the Javascript code in the jsfiddle is the current attempt at achieving this, but solving this problem seems much more complicated as the image is being manipulated by the Javascript code, so perhaps this needs to also be reloaded at the same time as the new randomised image is selected p  pThis is the current attempt at solving this problemp  precodefunction      var imageArray  [     httpwww.webdesignhot.comwpcontentuploads200910CatsVectorImage.jpg,     httpwww.costumeworks.comimageshalloweencatinwitchhat.jpg,     httponthewight.comwpcontent201304sootyryde.jpg]     reloadImagesimageArray     reload.onclick,function          masterdiv img[iddiv] .eachfunctionindex             this.removeClassjqPuzzle jqprindex3cindex3SCN             this.fadeOut slow, function                  ifindex0                      reloadImagesimageArray                                  this.addClassjqPuzzle jqprindex3cindex3SCN                 this.fadeIn                                function shuffleArrayarray      for var i  array.length  1 i gt 0 i          var j  Math.floorMath.random  i  1         var temp  array[i]         array[i]  array[j]         array[j]  temp          return array   function reloadImagesarray     shuffleArrayarray     forvar i0ilt3i          places the first image into all divs         document.getElementByIddivi1id.srcarray[0]       codepre  pIve written more details on the issue in the html section of the jsfiddle.

Positive 2 pI want to know how to center 3 images horizontally. I know how to get them aligned horizontally but then I loose my centering. So I have the pictures lined up horizontally, but I tried everything to get them centered and nothing is really working.

Positive 2 pI have created and Instagram clone and I am having some trouble with appending comments to individual codeltdivgtcode elements. What I would like to accomplish is to have a user type some text in the codeltinputgtcode box, click the submit button, and have said text appear under the codeltinputgtcode area via a codeltligtcode in a codeltulgtcode I created called codecommentlistcode. Similarly, I would only like said input to be targeted to each specific image imported from my JSON GET request without text duplication on any single item. The jQuery seems right to be able to append the text, but it isnt working and a fresh pair of eyes certainly wouldnt hurt.p  pHere is the jsbin a hrefhttpjsbin.comtecahaeditoutput

Positive 2 pFirst of all, lets suppose that I have the following canvas codeltcanvas idcan width400 height200 gtcode. And Then, I need to resize it with codewidth 100 height autocode to fit my responsive container. And now, lets suppose that my canvas got a width of 800. And the problem is that everytime when I try the get the positionx, y of a click event, I get the coordinates relative to the actual mouse position.p  pTo be clear, If I click the bottomedge of the canvas, Insted of getting the position400, 200, I get 800, 400.p  pAlready searched on the web for a solution but I cant find my specific problem and neither jQuery or vanilla javascript seems to have a easy approach to the problem. The only solution that I thought of was using a kind of a mathematical relation between the actual canvas dimensions setted in the DOM and the width and height of it after the scaling, but I really cant figure how.p

Is there a way I can have the menu stay compacted upon refreshingpli lipFrom my fiddle, you will have noticed on my CSS that I am trying to give my radio buttons hover characteristics as a way of previewing their presents on the div element but to no avail. I figure I will need to use scripts for that, right Specifically, when the mouse cursor hovers over a preset, the div element will momentarily express the details of that preset in this case, a different color and when the preset is selected, the div element will change its current color to that of the selected preset.pli lipI plan on expanding on this by having the user select a preset for the div element and send the form to save it on a database.

Negative 2 pIn a previous question, I asked about various ORM libraries. It turns out Kohana looks very clean yet functional for the purposes of ORM. I already have an MVC framework that I am working in though. If I dont want to run it as a framework, what is the right fileset to include to just give me the DB and ORM base class filesp  pUpdatep  pI jumped in and started looking at the ORM source code.. One thing was immediately confusing to me.. all the ORM classes have the class name appended with CORE i.e. ORMCore ORMIteratorCore, but the code everywhere is extending the ORM class. Problem is, Ive searched the whole code base 6 different ways, and Ive never seen a plain ORM class def nor an ORM interface def or anything.. Could someone enlighten me on where that magic happensp
Negative 2 pI have been given the task of either finding or developing a metadata repository for our development group.

Ideally, we would like to be able to go from the macro level applications, users to the micro tables, columns, indexes, data types.p  pA browserbased system that we could run on our intranet would be ideal, but we could go with something else.p  pThe most significant requirement is that the solution be as close to free as possible.p  pDoes anyone have any ideasp

Negative 2 pToday our virtual W2003 server storing our SVN repository too became veryvery busy. It turned out that it had only 88KB free space left on the C drive. Not that good.

Negative 2 pI am looking at improving a package that I believe not to be threadsafe when its input is shared between multiple worker threads.  According to TDD principles, I should write some tests that fail in the first instance, and these would certainly be useful in assessing the problem.p  pI realise that this is not a simple thing to acheive, and that naively, multithreaded tests will be nondeterministic as the operating system will determine scheduling and the exact order that various operations are interleaved.  I have looked at and used a hrefhttpwww.cs.umd.eduprojectsPLmultithreadedtcoverview.htmlMultithreadedTCa in the past, and this was useful.  However, in that case I knew in advance exactly where the existing implementation fell down, and thus was able to cook up a nice set of tests that covered it.p  pHowever, if youre not at the point where you know exactly what the problem is, is there a good way of going about writing a test that stands a good chance of throwing up any potential problems  Are there any libraries that others have found helpful Would I be right in thinking that from a purist point of view, a multithreaded test case should just be the same calls and assertions as the usual singlethreaded test, only run with multiple worker threads as appropriatep  pAny offers on toolsbest practicesphilosophy in general would be welcome.p

Negative 2 pIve noticed many times where some php scripts exit. It seems to me that this will force an exit of the httpdapache child of course another will be started if required for the next request.p  pBut in the CMS, that next request will require the entire init.php initialization, and of course just cleaning up and starting php in the first place.p  pIt seems that the php files usually start withp  precodeif  defined SMARTYDIR    includeonce init.php   codepre  pwhich suggests that somebody was imagining that one php process would serve multiple requests. But if every script exits, then each phpapache process will serve one request only.p  pAny thoughts on the performance and security implications of removing many of the exit calls especially from the mostfrequentlycalled scripts like index.php etc to allow one process to serve multiple requestsp  pThanks, Peterp  pADDENDUM  p  pThank you for the answers.  That php will never serve more than one request is what I thought originally until last week, when I was debugging a config variable that could only have been set in one script because of the way the path was set up but was still set in another script this is on a webserver with about 20 hitssec.  In that case, I did not have a php exit call in the one script that set up its config slightly differently.  But when I added the php exit call to that one script in the alternate directory this solved the misconfiguration I was experiencing in all my main scripts in the main directory which were due to having a css directory variable set erroneously, in a previous page execution.  So now Im confused again, because with what all the answers so far say, php should never serve more than one request.p

If this solution doesnt work for you, you are probably having a different issue which belongs in a separate question.emp  hr  pThis is a question asked before, both here on Stack Overflow and other places, but none of the suggestions Ive found this far has helped me, so I just have to try asking a new question.p  pScenario I have a simple Windows Forms application C, .NET 4.0, Visual Studio 2010. It has a couple of base forms that most other forms inherit from, it uses Entity Framework and POCO classes for database access. Nothing fancy, no multithreading or anything.p  pProblem All was fine for a while. Then, all out of the blue, Visual Studio failed to build when I was about to launch the application. I got the warning emUnable to delete file ...binDebug[ProjectName].exe. Access to the path ...binDebug[ProjectName].exe is denied.em and the error emUnable to copy file objx86Debug[ProjectName].exe to binDebug[ProjectName].exe. The process cannot access the file binDebug[ProjectName].exe because it is being used by another process.em I get both the warning and the error when running Rebuild, but only the error when running Build  dont think that is relevantp  pI understand perfectly fine what the warning and error message says Visual Studio is obviously trying to overwrite the exefile while it the same time has a lock on it for some reason. However, this doesnt help me find a solution to the problem... The only thing Ive found working is to shut down Visual Studio and start it again. Building and launching then works, untill I make a change in some of the forms, then I have the same problem again and have to restart... Quite frustratingp  pAs I mentioned above, this seems to be a known problem, so there are lots of suggested solutions. Ill just list what Ive already tried here, so people know what to skipp  ul liCreating a new clean solution and just copy the files from the old solution.li lipAdding the following to the following to the projects prebuild eventp  pif exist TargetPath.locked del TargetPath.locked br nbspnbspif not exist TargetPath.locked if exist TargetPath move TargetPath TargetPath.lockedpli lipAdding the following to the project properties .csproj filep  pltGenerateResourceNeverLockTypeAssembliestrueltGenerateResourceNeverLockTypeAssembliespli ul  pHowever, none of them worked for me, so you can probably see why Im starting to get a bit frustrated.

Negative 2 pI have encountered a problem in my program that has me somewhat stumped. I had a program that was working fine it was working fine on VS 2010 this is not an I upgraded to .NET and this error started happening post with a program that is mostly c and some c my boss HATES object oriented since it usually involves making calls to libraries that he is paranoid microsoft will stop supporting and would also have to be delivered to the customer if they have an older version which could be a problem since a lot of them are government and he also thinks that these calls cause unnecessary overhead so I have to try to avoid it as much as possible then I uncommented a block of code I will post this block a little lower as it has been modified some from the original one I uncomented to start working on it and got the error Runtime check error 2 the stack around std has been corrupted where std is a c style string of wchar. p  pI tried to figure out what the problem was by implementing some of the not so good fixes since if one works I will know what the actual problem is and then have a good base starting point for debugging. First I tried to increase the size of std to make it large enough that I wouldnt be putting a string larger than it can handle in it its values come from no more than 3 columns from a list view each of which cant be bigger than 80 characters and even though this made me get the error less often I still got it.p  pSo I tried switching std in that block of code to msg which was exactly the same as std at the time to see if msg got the same error which would mean it was produced by that block of code but the error still came up around std.p  precodecase IDCTXT                     FileSaveBoxhwnd, LSave as...,LText Files .txt0.txt0All Files0.0,L.txt,wFileName                     FileSaveBoxhwnd, LSave as...,LCSV Coma delimited .csv0.csv0All Files0.0,L.csv,wFileName                          ifwcslenwFileName0 return 0                          fin.openwFileName                         iffin.isopen                             valMessageBoxhwnd,LThis file allready exists.

I would like to know if there is any good way to debugged this problem since break points alone arent helping me and neither is the call stack although I may be using them wrongp  pBellow are the declarations of the variables and the only other place where it would be called before the function gets calledp  pDeclarationsp  precodeint i,j,k,count,val,ntx,nrx,IsActive, rxcount     BOOL callsign, map2rx, rxhit     double f1,f2,f3     WCHAR str[80]     static WCHAR msg[240]     WCHAR temp[80]     static short dir     FILE fp     stdwofstream fout     stdwifstream fin     LVCOLUMN pcol     LVITEM pit, pit2     static HWND hlvtx     static HWND hlvrx     static HWND hlvim codepre  pand other callsp  precodecount  ExternalAPIFunction2t             fori0iltcounti                              ntx  wtoiExternalAPIFunction1i1,SPNBTXCH                 nrx  wtoiExternalAPIFunction1i1,SPNBRXCH                 IsActive  wtoiExternalAPIFunction1i1,SPISACTIVE                  try                                  forj0jltntx ampamp IsActivej                                      f1  wtofExternalAPIFunction1i1,SPTXCH01j                     swprintfmsg,L09.4f MHz,f1                      pit.mask  LVIFTEXTLVIFPARAM                     pit.iItem  j                     pit.iSubItem  0                     pit.lParam  j                      wcscpysmsg,ExternalAPIFunction1i1,SPCALLSIGN                     wcscatsmsg,LCH                     itowj1,temp,80                     wcscatsmsg,temp                     pit.pszText  msg                     ListViewInsertItemhlvtx,amppit                     swprintfmsg,L.4f,f1                     pit.mask  LVIFTEXT                     pit.iSubItem  1                        pit.pszText  msg                     ListViewSetItemhlvtx,amppit                     f1  wtofExternalAPIFunction1i1,SPNOMINALPOWER                     swprintfmsg,L.1f,f1                     pit.iSubItem  2                        pit.pszText  msg                     ListViewSetItemhlvtx,amppit                     swprintfmsg,Lf,i1                     pit.iSubItem  3                        pit.pszText  msg                     ListViewSetItemhlvtx,amppit                                              catchstdexception ampe                                      MessageBoxhwnd,wchart e.what,LError, MBOK                                   forj0jltnrx ampamp IsActivej                                      f1  wtofExternalAPIFunction1i1,SPRXCH01j                     pit.mask  LVIFTEXTLVIFPARAM                     pit.iItem  j                     pit.iSubItem  0                     pit.lParam  j                      wcscpymsg,ExternalAPIFunction1i1,SPCALLSIGN                     wcscatmsg,LCH                     itowj1,temp,10                     wcscatmsg,temp                     pit.pszText  msg                     ListViewInsertItemhlvrx,amppit                     swprintfmsg,L.4f,f1                     pit.mask  LVIFTEXT                     pit.iSubItem  1                        pit.pszText  msg                     ListViewSetItemhlvrx,amppit                     f1  wtofExternalAPIFunction1i1,SPRXBANDWIDTH                     swprintfmsg,L.2f,f1                     pit.iSubItem  2                        pit.pszText  msg                     ListViewSetItemhlvrx,amppit                     swprintfmsg,Lf,i1                     pit.iSubItem  3                        pit.pszText  msg                     ListViewSetItemhlvrx,amppit                               codepre  pP.S.

The problem is that the XML have references to each other due to my models relationships.  p  pHere is some code to help illustrate the problemp  pMy model a hrefhttpbara.stardock.comimagesactivitymodel.png relnofollowhttpbara.stardock.comimagesactivitymodel.pngap  pThe Activities class that handles the service logicp  precode[AspNetCompatibilityRequirementsRequirementsMode  AspNetCompatibilityRequirementsMode.Allowed] [ServiceBehaviorIncludeExceptionDetailInFaults  true, InstanceContextMode  InstanceContextMode.PerCall, ConcurrencyMode  ConcurrencyMode.Single] public class Activities  IActivities      public ActivitiesList GetActivitiesstring titleId, string accountId, string numToReturn              stardockActivitiesEntities sdActivitiesDb  new stardockActivitiesEntities          int accountIdInt  int.ParseaccountId          ListltActivitygt items  from a in sdActivitiesDb.Activities                                 join ab in sdActivitiesDb.ActivityBridges                                     on a.ActivityID equals ab.ActivityID                                 where ab.AccountID  accountIdInt                                 select a.ToList          ActivitiesList list  new ActivitiesListitems          return list       codepre  pThe interface for the above classp  precode[ServiceContract] public interface IActivities      [OperationContract]     [WebGetUriTemplate  titleIdaccountsaccountIdlimitsnumToReturn]     ActivitiesList GetActivitiesstring titleId, string accountId, string numToReturn  codepre  pThe Activity class is autogenerated by the entity framework based on my model for the Activities table.  However, I did extend on this class by creating an ActivitiesList objectp  precode[XmlRootNamespace  httpschemas.datacontract.org200407Stardock.CVP.Stats] public partial class Activity     [XmlRootNamespace  httpschemas.datacontract.org200407Stardock.CVP.Stats] [DataContractIsReferencefalse] public class ActivitiesList      [DataMember]     public ListltActivitygt Activities  get set       public ActivitiesList              Activities  new ListltActivitygt           public ActivitiesListListltActivitygt list              Activities  new ListltActivitygt          foreach Activity item in list                      Activities.Additem                    public void AddActivity a              Activities.Adda       codepre  pSo to explain my problem again, my XML, rather than simply returning a list of Activity like it should, instead returns a list of Activity with some activities referencing other activities that are within the base activities.  That sounds confusing, but look at the images belowp  pReturned XML a hrefhttpbara.stardock.comimagesactivityxml1.png relnofollowhttpbara.stardock.comimagesactivityxml1.pngap  pThe activity with a reference of i8 is referring to another activity that is actually inside the activity with the id of i2 a hrefhttpbara.stardock.comimagesactivityxml2.png relnofollowhttpbara.stardock.comimagesactivityxml2.pngap  pMy question is, how can I remove all of those extra relationships from the Activity object  Id prefer it to just be a list of Activity without the nested ActivityType, EntityKey, etc. that are autogenerated by the entity framework.p  pI hope Ive sufficiently explained myself.  And if not, let me know what other details youd like to see and Ill provide them.p  pBarap

Negative 2 pFirst the background, specifics of my question will followp  pAt the company that I work at the platform we work on is currently the Microchip PIC32 family using the MPLAB IDE as our development environment.  Previously weve also written firmware for the Microchip dsPIC and TI MSP families for this same application. The firmware is pretty straightforward in that the code is split into three main modules device control, data sampling, and user communication usually a user PC.  Device control is achieved via some combination of GPIO bus lines and at least one part needing SPI or I2C control.  Data sampling is interrupt driven using a Timer module to maintain sample frequency and more SPII2C and GPIO bus lines to control the sampling hardware ie. ADC.  User communication is currently implemented via USB using the Microchip App Framework.p  hr  pSo now the question given what Ive described above, at what point would I consider employing an RTOS for my project  Currently Im thinking of these possible trigger points as reasons to use an RTOSp  ul liemstrongCode complexityemstrong  The code base architectureorganization is still small enough that I can keep all the details in my head.li liemstrongMultitaskingThreadingemstrong  Timeslicing the module execution via interrupts suffices for now for multitasking.li liemstrongTestingemstrong  Currently we dont do much formal testing or verification past the HW smoke test something I hope to rectify in the near future.li liemstrongCommunicationemstrong  We currently use a custom packet format and a protocol that pretty much only does START, STOP, SEND DATA commands with data being a binary blob.li liemstrongProject scopeemstrong  There is a possibility in the near future that well be getting a project to integrate our device into a larger system with the goal of taking that system to mass production.  Currently all our projects have been experimental prototypes with quick turnaround of about a month, producing one or two units at a time.li ul  pWhat other points do you think I should consider  In your experience what convinced or forced you to consider using an RTOS vs just running your code on the base runtime  Pointers to additional resources about designingprogramming for an RTOS is also much appreciated.p

Negative 2 pI have a recursive function in my JavaScript file. It looks something like thisp  precodefunction processnode     ifsomeCondition         return someValue     a  processnode.children     b  doSomethinga     return b  codepre  pThe problem is that I want to display the state of the system to the HTML output on each step of this recursion. There should be a delay between each step. Just assume that I want to display the recursion live to the users.

Negative 2 pSo here i am trying to teach my friend the art of C. He is no newbie to programming, but his area of expertise is somewhat further away from C. He knows html, php and java fairly well, but it seems this is of no use when it comes to writing a C program. We already went through the basics, talked about pointers and such. He even had a course at his university about C but he gave up halfway through. It seems that he really understands basic theory  the problem is he fails when it comes to actually using what he knows to write programs.p  pSo what im trying to do now is to give him homeworks. The task is always to write a small program, such as a primitive calculator input two numbers and a letter which determines operation that should be performed... etc. The idea behind this is to force him to actually use the language to solve problems, debug it and see why it fails and learn from it. But it seems it does not work, since every time i try to make it harder and give him a more complex homework, he is not able to solve it. What should I do now Im really running out on ideas of homeworks and i have doubts that this approach is good. Moreover, new semester starts just right now and he stronghasstrong to pass the C course this time. So there is even a deadline  the end of this year.p  pSO, can you help herep

Negative 2 pAfter updating from the native .NET oracle data provider to Oracles ODP.NET, Ive run into the following issue.  p  pI have a stored procedure that is part of a package, and it accepts 32 parameters, all IN but one, designated as an OUT parameter.  Anyway, here is the issue Im having.  I have a date parameter passed in as a varchar2 and then 3 other parameters that are varchar2 as well.  As for the rest, they are all NUMBER types.p  pIn my .NET code all the values passed to the stored procedure are either string or int, with 4 exceptions. I have 4 items of data of type UInt32.  The value they hold is too large for an int so uint was used.p  pHere is the problem.  When we were using the native .NET oracle data provider, the parameter constructor includes a datatype of OracleType.Number, now the oracle parameter constructor has OracleDbType.Int32 and OracleDbType.Int64.

Negative 2 pI am fairly new to Perl and know next to nothing about Perls proper syntax. p  pI have a text file that I use everyday with a listing of names, and other info for our users. This file changes daily and sometimes has two rows in ittab delimited, and other times has 100 rows in it. p  pThe file also varies between 69 columns of data in a row. I have put together a Perl script that uses the split function on tabs, but the issue I am running into is that if I take row emaem, which has 5 columns in it and then add a second row embem that has 6 columns in it that are all populated with data. p  pI cannot figure out how to get Perl to see that row a only has 5 columns of data and to continue parsing the text file from that point forward. It continues, but the output wraps lines strangely. How can I get around this issue I hope that made sense.p

One for the main menu, one for the high scores list, one for the game itself, and one for a final end screen that shows the score and asks the user to input hisher name.p  pOn Mac OS X, once one JPanel gets focus using MouseListener or with a Timer, the focus is easily switched to new JPanels. On Windows, however, you have to click each time with each screen to manually get the focus back.p  pMy question is, is there an elegant, crossplatform solution to always keeping focus within the Applets topmost JPanel, even when the toplevel JPanel changesp  pHeres a sample code of what Im doing to switch between JPanelsp  precodepublic void showMainMenu          if endScreen  null              endScreen.stop             getContentPane.removeendScreen             endScreen  null                   if highScoreView  null              getContentPane.removehighScoreView             highScoreView  null                   if gameView  null              gameView.stop             getContentPane.removegameView             gameView  null                   if mainMenu  null                       mainMenu  new MainMenud, this                   getContentPane.addmainMenu              forceRequestFocus         validate         repaint      codepre  pI tried using a workaround I found on here to use a nonrepeating Timer to get the focus of the JPanel, so the user doesnt have to click on it. Only problem is, that it only works once. After a new JPanel replaces another, focus is lost and can only be regained with a mouse click.p  precodeprivate void forceRequestFocus      Timer focusTimer  new Timer5, new RequestFocusActionListener     focusTimer.setRepeatsfalse     focusTimer.start   private class RequestFocusActionListener implements ActionListener      public void actionPerformedActionEvent e          if highScoreView  null              highScoreView.requestFocusInWindow                   else if mainMenu  null              mainMenu.requestFocusInWindow                   else if gameView  null              gameView.requestFocusInWindow                   else if endScreen  null              endScreen.requestFocusInWindow                codepre

Negative 2 pIve search around and found questions about storing and retrieving files from a ContentProvider but my situation is a little different.p  pI am building an app that will host content for one of our other apps.  Think of it as a way to sell content without actually having inapppurchase.p  pIt is currently working, but I have to make copies of the images into the cache so that the ParcelFileDescriptor passed back from openFile is valid.  I was hoping that someone might know how to reference and arbitrary ParcelFileDescriptor from a file bundled with the app.  Assets doesnt seem to facilitate this.  Raw is likely the same scenario.p  pLet me try to explain by example... THIS is how I would expect things to work if I were storing all my files in assets which I currently am.p  precodeOverride public ParcelFileDescriptor openFileUri uri, String mode throws FileNotFoundException      String fileName  uri.getEncodedPath     AssetFileDescriptor afd  getContext.getAssets.openFdfileName     ParcelFileDescriptor pfd  afd.getParcelFileDescriptor     return pfd  codepre  pBut, of course, this doesnt work.  I get a valid ParcelFileDescriptor returned to the app calling the ContentResolver, but it appears to be pointing to the entire assets directory. After reading around the intertubes for a while, it seems that assets doesnt allow for a descriptor to reference it from outside of the app its associated with though, I have no references for this.p  pI solved the problem by copying the file in question into the cache of the app hosting the ContentProvider then returning the ParcelFileDescriptor of the cached file. This works just fine... but I end up doubling the size of the app.p  pThats the heart of my question... Is there a way to bundle a static file of any type to be served from a ContentProvider without having to copy it into a cache.p  pEven if I were to use sqlite and store the files as blobs, Id have to make an initial copy of the database so that it would be writable... so its the same end.p  pDoes this make sense p

Negative 2 pIve written a portable framework in JavaScript, and Id like to run some performance tests under various JavaScript interpreter shell environments. In order to accomplish this, I need to be able to pass commandline arguments argv to the script context. Rhino and Spidermonkey interpreters do this by default already, exposing all arguments after the script file as an array bound to the the arguments identifier on the global object. It was originally my intention to bring the same functionality to the v8 sample shell, as well as the JavaScriptCore jsc shell, but I soon realized that this would require much more effort, and I really only need the last commandline argument in order to run my tests. So, I have been able to get this working in v8, converting the last char element in argv to a v8String and binding it to the identifier lastArg on the global object. p  pUnfortunately, Im having much more trouble accomplishing the same thing with JavaScriptCore.

If the exponential value is larger than the sine value, the output sample is zero.

Negative 2 pIve been encharged, during my university internship, to create a web application to manage maintenace operations in the factory I work in. Im an industrial engineer with just a little knowledge about database programming, so maybe this question will sound easy to you, I apologize. p  pThats the situation the item is a mold, which needs ordinary maintenance after a number of operations huge number, Im talking about tiles manufacturing, and the maintenance frequency can be assumed as a mean value of once per year. I set up a database and the web application connected to it, and I created a view with the molds list and the relative cumulative work, so that the departments responsible can have a fast perspective of the situation and see which molds need maintenance, and that works fine.p  pThe problem is they labeled the molds, and I used that number as the row ID in the database. When the maintenance is performed the cumulative work needs to be resetted, but he wants to keep historical data about working operations. p  pThus, what I need to do now, is tell the system when an item is manteined, then it has to reset the cumulative value while keeping historical data.p  pValues for the view I created are taken from 2 different tables Molds and UnmountingOperations. In the latter there are information about which press the mold has been mounted on and the total work done during that operation. I thougt the solution is in the use of triggers, but Id would like to askp  pWhats the best practice to do sop  phere you are the scripts created by SqlServer management studio.Sorry but record names are in Italian. mold tablep  precodeCREATE TABLE [dbo].[Stampo] [ID] [int] NOT NULL, [Formato] [nchar]10 NOT NULL, [n uscite] [int] NULL, [Spessore] [nchar]10 NULL, [Descrizione] [nvarchar]max NULL, [Fornitore] [nvarchar]50 NULL, CONSTRAINT [PKStampo] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED   [ID] ASC WITH PADINDEX   OFF, STATISTICSNORECOMPUTE   OFF, IGNOREDUPKEY  OFF,       ALLOWROWLOCKS   ON, ALLOWPAGELOCKS   ON ON [PRIMARY]  ON [PRIMARY] codepre  ppress tablep  precodeCREATE TABLE [dbo].[Pressa] [Numero] [int] NOT NULL, [Modello] [nchar]10 NULL, CONSTRAINT [PKPressa] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED   [Numero] ASC WITH PADINDEX   OFF, STATISTICSNORECOMPUTE   OFF, IGNOREDUPKEY  OFF,  ALLOWROWLOCKS   ON, ALLOWPAGELOCKS   ON ON [PRIMARY]  ON [PRIMARY] codepre  passociation moldpress for unmounting operationsmqpressati is the work amount driver,stands for square meters pressedp  precodeCREATE TABLE [dbo].[SmontaggioStampi] [NumeroPressa] [int] NOT NULL, [IDStampo] [int] NOT NULL, [DataSmontaggio] [datetime] NOT NULL, [mqpressati] [int] NOT NULL, [Descrizione] [nvarchar]max NULL, CONSTRAINT [PKProduzione presse] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED   [NumeroPressa] ASC, [IDStampo] ASC, [DataSmontaggio] ASC WITH PADINDEX   OFF, STATISTICSNORECOMPUTE   OFF, IGNOREDUPKEY  OFF, ALLOWROWLOCKS   ON, ALLOWPAGELOCKS   ON ON [PRIMARY]  ON [PRIMARY]  GO  ALTER TABLE [dbo].[SmontaggioStampi]  WITH CHECK ADD  CONSTRAINT  [FKSmontaggioStampiPressa] FOREIGN KEY[NumeroPressa] REFERENCES [dbo].[Pressa] [Numero] GO  ALTER TABLE [dbo].[SmontaggioStampi] CHECK CONSTRAINT [FKSmontaggioStampiPressa] GO  ALTER TABLE [dbo].[SmontaggioStampi]  WITH CHECK ADD  CONSTRAINT [FKSmontaggioStampiStampo] FOREIGN KEY[IDStampo] REFERENCES [dbo].[Stampo] [ID] GO  ALTER TABLE [dbo].[SmontaggioStampi] CHECK CONSTRAINT [FKSmontaggioStampiStampo] GO codepre

Negative 2 pFor implementing a physically accurate motion blur by actually rendering at intermediate locations, it seems that to do this correctly I need a special blending function. Additive blending would only work on a black background, and the standard transparency function codeGLSRCALPHA, GLONEMINUSSRCALPHAcode may look okay for small numbers of samples, but it is physically inaccurate because samples rendered at the end will contribute more to the resulting color. p  pThe function I need has to produce a color which is the weighted average of the original and destination colors, depending on the number of samples covering a fragment. However I can generalize this to better account for rendering differences between samples Suppose I am to render a blurred object n times. Treating color as a 3vector, Let codeDcode be the color codeDEST  SRCcode. I want each render to add codeDncode to the source color. p  pCan this be done using the fixedfunction pipeline a hrefhttpwww.opengl.orgsdkdocsmanxhtmlglBlendFunc.xml relnofollowThe glBlendFunc referencea is rather cryptic, at least to me. It seems like this can be done either trivially or is impossible. It seems like I would want to set alpha to code1ncode. For the behavior I just described, am I in need of a codeGLDESTMINUSSRCCOLORcode optionp  pI also have a related question At which stage does this blending operation occur Before or after the fragment shader program Would i be able to access the source and destination colors in a fragment shaderp  pI know that one way to accomplish what I want is by using an accumulation buffer. I do not want to do this because it is a waste of memory and fillrate. p

Negative 2 pI implemented a simple kernel which is some sort of a convolution. I measured it on NVIDIA GT 240. It took 70 ms when written on CUDA and 100 ms when written on OpenCL. Ok, I thought, NVIDIA compiler is better optimized for CUDA or Im doing something wrong.  I need to run it on AMD GPUs, so I migrated to AMD APP SDK. Exactly the same kernel code.p  pI made two tests and their results were discouraging for me 200 ms at HD 6670 and 70 ms at HD 5850 the same time as for GT 240  CUDA. And I am very interested of the reasons of such strange behaviour.p  pAll projects were built on VS2010 using settings from the sample projects of NVIDIA and AMD respectively.p  pPlease, do not consider my post as NVIDIA advertisement. I fairly understand that HD 5850 is more powerful than GT 240. The only thing I wish to know is why such difference is and how to fix the problem.p  pUpdate. Below is the kernel code which looks for 6 equally sized template images in the base one. Every pixel of the base image is considered as a possible origin of one of the templates and is processed by a separate thread. The kernel compares R, G, B values of each pixel of the base image and of the template one, and if at least one difference exceeds codediffcode parameter, the corresponding pixel is counted nonmatched. If the number of nonmatched pixels is less than codemaxNonmatchQtcode the corresponding template is hit. p  precodeconstant int tOffset  8196  one template size in memory in bytes kernel void matchImage6 global unsigned char image,  pointer to the base image             int imgWidth,  base image width             int imgHeight,  base image height             int imgPitch,  base image pitch in bytes             int imgBpp,  base image bytes  per pixel             constant unsigned char templates,  pointer to the array of templates             int tWidth,  templates width the same for all             int tHeight,  templates height the same for all             int tPitch,  templates pitch in bytes, the same for all             int tBpp,  templates bytes  per pixel the same for all             int diff,  max allowed difference of intensity             int maxNonmatchQt,  max number of nonmatched pixels             global int result,  results                               int x0  intgetglobalid0 int y0  intgetglobalid1 if x0  tWidth gt imgWidth  y0  tHeight gt imgHeight     return int nonmatchQt[]  0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 for int y  0 y lt tHeight y      int ind  y  tPitch     int baseImgInd  y0  y  imgPitch  x0  imgBpp     for int x  0 x lt tWidth x          unsigned char c0  image[baseImgInd]         unsigned char c1  image[baseImgInd  1]         unsigned char c2  image[baseImgInd  2]         for int i  0 i lt 6 i             if abs c0  templates[i  tOffset  ind] gt diff                               abs c1  templates[i  tOffset  ind  1] gt diff                               abs c2  templates[i  tOffset  ind  2] gt diff                 nonmatchQt[i]         ind  tBpp         baseImgInd  imgBpp          if nonmatchQt[0] gt maxNonmatchQt ampamp nonmatchQt[1] gt maxNonmatchQt ampamp nonmatchQt[2] gt maxNonmatchQt ampamp nonmatchQt[3] gt maxNonmatchQt ampamp nonmatchQt[4] gt maxNonmatchQt ampamp nonmatchQt[5] gt maxNonmatchQt         return  for int i  0 i lt 6 i     if nonmatchQt[i] lt maxNonmatchQt          unsigned int pos  atominc ampresult[0]  3         result[pos  1]  i         result[pos  2]  x0         result[pos  3]  y0       codepre  pKernel run configuration Global work size  1900, 1200 Local work size  32, 8 for AMD and 32, 16 for NVIDIA.p  pExecution time HD 5850  69 ms, HD 6670  200 ms, GT 240  100 ms.p  pAny remarks about my code are also highly appreciated.p

Negative 2 pIn my application the main thread creates two joined threads one which waits for user input by calling scanf in a loop and another one which listens for incoming socket connections by calling accept in a loop.   New connections are handled in separate threads which are detached.   p  pI want the program to shut itself down gracefully when a SIGINT signal is received.   That means that the listening thread should stop accepting new connections, wait for threads currently serving connections to close and then then.   The thread waiting for user input should also end and thereby allowing the main thread to end.p  pScanf and accept both block but can be interrupted by a signal, however signals sent to the process can only be handled by one thread AFAIK.   My idea is to block SIGINT signals in all threads except the main thread which will wait for it.   When it receives a SIGINT, it will then send SIGUSR1 to the two threads one which blocks on scanf and one which blocks on accept and then join on these threads.p  pIs this a good solution   Is there a better or perhaps standard way to achieve thisp

Negative 2 pMy question is how can I specify size of the parts on my layout br strongI need somehow set size of parts not using preferedSize, maybe in layout managers, doesnt matter where  only I need is stable size.strongp  pI want to create layout for game. Ive already created one but Im dealing with problem with size of components. So I considered that it would be better to make better concept of my layout. br Lets look at my draft.p  pre     UPPER         A          C     B          Footer       ABC make together Center. pre  pMain part consist of this tree partsbr Upper there will be menu. br Center  this consists of 3 parts A,B,Cbr Footer  there will be status barbr brbr My idea is to be able to set the size of each component. All layout is dependent on part C it could have size 450x450 px or 600x600 px.br For part A and B i need specify only the width, because there will be only some text info  it should be about 300 px.br I tryed to use GridBagLayout for Center part but setSize for C didnt worked well.br I make the parts in Containers java.awt.Container  in them I add the content of each part and then add the Container to the upper level.p
Negative 2 pI have a table called codeMessagecode. Each message may be associated with an codeInvoicecode table or an codeRfpcode table, but not both. Im struggling with the best way to implement thisp  ol lipOne approach is for the codeMessagecode table to have foreign keys to both codeInvoicecode and codeRfpcode tables. One FK would be valid while the other must be NULL. SingleTable Inheritance. But this seems rather awkward. In addition to the unused column, I need to find ways to prevent cases where the FKs are either both used or both NULL. And this would need to be repeated for every single message.pli lipAnother approach is to create a joining table. In this case, my codeMessagecode table would have an FK to the joining table, and the codeInvoicecode and codeRfpcode tables would also have an FK to the joining table. However, the problem here is that, given a reference to the joining table, it is awkward to find the related codeInvoicecode or codeRfpcode table because I wouldnt know which contains the FK. So, here, I need to resort to other steps to know how to find the related table, such as adding a column to signify which table is related, for which it is hard to create a constraint.pli lipFinally, I could create two types of codeMessagecode tables. This solves the problems described above, but this causes problems for our app because we have logic in places that needs to add messages without knowing what type they are. We can only have an FK to the related table.pli ol  pCan anyone offer some tips here. None of these ways are ideal, but perhaps there are aspects Ive failed to consider when choosing between the two. Or perhaps there is a better approach altogether.p

Negative 2 pIve written an App and now, post release, some of my users seem to be experiencing a nasty bug. One that I am simply unable to reproduce.p  pInvolved in this are three Activities.p  pActivity 1 SuperActivityp  precodepublic abstract class SuperActivity extends Activity codepre  pActivity 2 MainActivityp  precodepublic class MainActivity extends SuperActivity     private MyObject myMemberVariable        Override   public void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState       Get the intent that started this activity. I am always providing Extras, so this is never null.     Bundle bundle  getIntent.getExtras      Set stuff in myMemberVariable from these extras. This never fails either.     myMemberVariable  BundleLoader.loadFromBundlebundle         Override   public void onListDialogClickint requestCode, String[] options, int position, String extra      THIS is the place where, according to my stacktrace from the DeveloperConsole, the null pointer arises.     myMemberVariable.setXYposition    codepre  pActivity 3 ListDialogActivityp  precodepublic class ListDialogActivity extends SuperActivity codepre  pWhat Im doing here is I start the ListDialogActivity from MainActivity to present the user with a few choices. Once he made a selection, the ListDialogActivity will set a result and then finish. In the SuperActivity Ive gotp  precodeonActivityResultint requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data    if activityRequestCode was ListDialogRequestCode and the Result was RESULTOK, then call onListDialogClick.. with the appropriate values.  codepre  pSo this is how the onListDialogClick in my MainActivity is invoked So you can just think of it as a normal onActivityResult. There, SOME few users experience a null pointer exception because myMemberVariable is null.p  pI cannot figure out what is happening here. Also, I am saving my instance state to handle phone rotations, but even if I did not, since the onCreate would be recalled, it still would not be null, it would only have lost its state and been recreated from the initial Intent.p  pCan anyone please explain to me how this is possible and whats happening here Did I missunderstand something from Android Why is it only happening to a few people What could be the reason for this Id be really gratefull for even the tiniest suggestion.p  pThanks so muchp

When a job is completed sometime in the future, it should report back to the UI, so that the user is informed of its status. Until then, the user should have the option of editing or cancelling a scheduled job.p  pAn implementation approach would be to have a Scheduler thread running constantly in the background in one of the nodes and collecting JobDetail definitions for job execution.p  pIn any case, there are two the questions applicable for either a singlenode or multinode scenariop  ol liDoes Quartz allow a modification or a cancellation of an already scheduled jobli liHow can a callback mechanism be implemented so that a job execution result is reported back to the UIli ol  pAny code examples, or pointers, are greatly appreciated.p

Negative 2 pIm developing a graphicsintensive application for Android 2.2 and above.p  pI know that starting with Honeycomb, bitmaps are stored on VMHEAP instead of their native bitmap heap.p  pDoes this influence the effective memory usage of my application I mean, e.g., if my app for preHoneycomb devices uses X MB of the VM heap, and has Y MB bitmaps stored on native heap, then I hope it wont start using XY MB from the VM heap if its installed on a Honeycomb or newer device.p  pThis does not sound logical. Instead, I guess that bitmap size is counted against the VM limits even prior to Honeycomb, otherwise why would bitmap size exceeds VM budget errors appear So theyre stored on their native heap but still counted against VMHEAP size maximum.p

Anyway, I do not have permission to update this version to test this, and I cant find any information about supporting DOM in earlier versions.p  pOr have I forgotten something I had kind of the same problem with JSON which isnt supported in 5.1.6, and then I could include some upgrade.php file that I put next to index.php, and it worked.

This bascially means to find a valid allocation of a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiAbstractsyntaxtreeASTa nodes to grammar production rules. This is a a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiConstraintsatisfactionconstraint satisfaction problem CSPa in general and could be solved, like parsing, by a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiBacktrackingbacktrackinga in Oexpn. p  pFortunately for parsing, this can be done in On using a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiGLRparserGLRa or better restricting the grammar.

Negative 2 pWhat I have here is thisp  pA Biztalk project in Visual Studio 2010, a corresponding Biztalk application running on a Biztalk 2010 server.

When the receive port is using the FILE adapter, all works as intended data from the HL7 file is inserted into tables.p  pSo, we reached the point where a web service was needed in order to expose the Receive port via the web...great we have the Biztalk WCF Service Publishing Wizard built right into VS2010. This is where Im stopped in my tracks. p  pI can follow the wizard as far as the Create step, it makes it about halfway to the emExtracting Schemas from Biztalk Assemblyem then it barfs and throws a generic errorp  pThe given key was not present in the dictionaryp  pAfter much searching and head scratching, I was finally led to fact that the wizard uses Xsd.exe new to me to generate code from the schemas. This led me to the MSDN library article a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryew6ts9yw.aspx relnofollowHerea which states that included schemas are ignored by Xsd.exe. Well, the HL7V3 schemaset for the message we are using has about 30 files altogether  all referencing each other all over the place like sop  precodeltxsinclude schemaLocation..coreschemasinfrastructureRoot.xsdgt ltxsinclude schemaLocationCOCTMT050002UV07.xsdgt ltxsinclude schemaLocationCOCTMT090100UV01.xsdgt ltxsinclude schemaLocationCOCTMT240000UV01.xsdgt ltxsinclude schemaLocationCOCTMT150000UV02.xsdgt codepre  pSo theres my problem.p  pSo now my question is this Is there a way to manually create a WCF service from a Biztalk project, or better yet, just get the Wizard to work for this case Or, just any suggestions on where to look, as this is my first Biztalk project.p  pMy Googling has only come up with a plethora of howtos for the Wizard.p

Negative 2 pIm working on an Android app that does nothing more then storing data in a SQLite database and displaying it.p  pSince I have a .NET background I started off developing the app with MonoDroid C. After developing the app with MonoDroid I thought it would be fun to redevelop it with Java and learn along the way.p  pIn the original app I used a TabActivity and created 4 tabs to stucturize the data I want to save in a single table. Underneath the tabs I placed a button. A click on the button collects all data on the 4 tabs to store it, and it worked perfect.p  pNow developing with Java I noticed that the TabActivity is deprecated and I found out that I have to use fragments. I was able to create the tabs following this a hrefhttpthepseudocoder.wordpress.com20111004androidtabsthefragmentway relnofollowarticlea. However, I am no longer able to read the data on the tabs. I searched online and tried the most ridiculous solutions for a couple days in a row now, and I start to doubt if the functionality I look for is possible.p  pPlease advise me what to do Is it possible to recreate this functionality using fragments If so, can anyone give me some pointers If not, what would be the best way to approach thisp  pThanks in advancep
Negative 2 pIve been programming professionally in C, and only C, for around 10 years in a variety of roles.p  pAs would be normal to expect, I understand the idioms of the language fairly well and beyond that also some of the design nuances  which APIs to make public, who calls what, who does what, what is supposed to reentrant and so on. I grew up reading Writing Solid Code, its early C edition, not the one based on C.p  pHowever, Ive never ever programmed in an OO language. Now, I want to migrate to writing applications for iPhone maybe android, so want to learn to use ObjectiveC and use it with a degree of competence fitting a professional programmer. p  pHow do I wrap my head around the OO stuff What would be your smallest reading list suggestion to me.p  pIs there a book that carries some sort of relatively real world example OO design ObjectiveCp  pBesides, the reading what source code would you recommend me to go through. p  pTIAp

Negative 2 pSorry if the title is inaccurate, but I cant explain the problem in 1 line.p  pThe scenario is this We have a website showing live statistics calculated by constantly updated values in our SQL Server database. The website updates the stats every 15 seconds via AJAX, where it recalculates every time. Now, the problem is, that when over 200 people whats the real time stats it recalculates every 800 times every minute, which pretty much is unnecessary.p  pIt is possible to do 1 calculation every 15 second, and show this 1 calculation to every user when requested by themp  pBare in mind, that some users can have selected to show the data in 1 way, while other users have selected to show the data in another way.p

Negative 2 pIn Visual Studio 2010, I have many CC source files that take several minutes to compile. However, once they are compiled, Im working only on a few files and would like to recompile them completely without deleting the compilation of the other file. I can do this if I just add a small comment to the file and its modified, then the compiler recompiles only those files that have been modified from scratch, but Id prefer to avoid modifying the source to do this. Is there a better wayp  pBasically what happens is I am cleaning up the code and eliminating issues. To do so, after every fix I recompile and test. However, when I do that, it erases the list of the issues that existed, so I am forced to add a comment line to the file Im interested in checking to force it to recompile without cleaning the whole project.p

We then store the returned results from codefilegetcontentscode into a variable named codecontentscode. Finally we convert the returned data from codefilegetcontentscode into the variable codehtmlcode.p  pTo start of course we would need to build a simple handler that sends our JSON to the server. p  pMost importantly we need to create a backend function to parse our results and send back our data.p  pThe question is, how might we go about doing this in an open ended context where any possible sequence of PHP functions calls and code might be passedp

Negative 2 pI followed this excellent tutorial to set up to build a framework Im building for an iOS app.  p  pa hrefhttpspin.atomicobject.com20111213buildingauniversalframeworkforios relnofollowhttpspin.atomicobject.com20111213buildingauniversalframeworkforiosap  pI have everything working pretty well except for one little detail.  Sometimes, it can take several attempts at building the project before all the header files are copied into the final framework.  p  pOccasionally Ill hit Build and the Headers folder for the framework is completely empty at the end.  Sometimes it will have 90 of the headers, but not all.  Once in a while I get lucky and they all seem to be there.p  pWhat would cause this and how do I correct itp  pUpdate So far my only solution is to just keep rebuilding the framework and eventually it copies all the headers the way I expect it to.  Still looking for a better answer though.p

Negative 2 pWe are trying to create a quick order form where a client inputs an item SKU and its quantity, then tabs down to the next row and does the same. Upon tabbing to the quantity input, we need to have jQuery run a check against our database to ensure that is a real SKU and respond with a success or fail message to the client. We have looked at various codes and have found those that work by adding a new row and by checking against a single input, but we cannot find nor am able to write the code that allows for both. Not sure if we can allow for the input to have its name attribute use name[] or if it needs a set name, name1, name2, etc. If we use name[], how does the call to the database know which inut field to use to get the variable. p  pAny help is greatly appreciated.

Negative 2 pIm looking at the workings of an HTML5 game framework, and was wondering about a particular optimization it makes.p  pThe framework keeps track of dirty ares of the screen that might have changed.  If an entity overlaps with such an area, then it is redrawn.  First, however, the context is clipped to only the dirty area.p  pIs this faster than simply redrawing the entire image  What about if the entity is rendered through a more complicated series of canvas commandsp  pemeem After thinking about it a little more, I realized theres a reason why clipping is vital in the context of the game framework, regardless of performance.  I am still kinda curious about that, though, so Ill leave the question up as is.p

Negative 2 pWe have a production application Classic ASP, IIS 7.5 that uses the IIS Default Website and a virtual directory. The application accesses documents from a document share. It works and has worked for many years. p  pRecently we have added a number of new web applications all under Default Web Site and we are attempting to separate them out into their own IIS Websites. So, we setup a new IIS Website and used a binding to get the application to use the new web site and used the same application pool pointing to the exact same code. note our application uses subdomains to point to different databases so we just took one subdomain and binded it to the new site.p  pFor some reason, the documents that are accessible from the Default Web Site are not accessible in the new website. But given that both are using the same application pool and thus share the same application pool identity, how is it possible that one website can access the share, but the other cannotp  pMore info. we have tried using a domain user as the app pool identity and NETWORKSERVICE both of which work in the Default, neither of which work in the new web site. Also, how are we accessing the documents We have an ASP file which simply uses the ADO Stream object and we reference the file using docserverdocuments... which again, is the same in both websites as they are both looking at the same code.p

Negative 2 pIm using ReSharper in my C projects, and generally I love it. However, it keeps adding annotations to the code when I do certain refactoring actions.p  pFor example, it adds code[NotNull]code when I use the Check parameter for null context actionp  precode Before context action public void Fooobject input     After context action public void Foo[NotNull] object input      if input  null              throw new ArgumentNullExceptioninput       codepre  pAdditionally, ReSharper then adds codeusing JetBrains.Annotationscode to the file, even though Im not referencing the JetBrains assembly where the attribute is defined.p  pI would like to continue using the context actions, as theyre very useful, but I cant introduce external annotations in the code. ReSharper provides an option to change the default annotation namespace and to copy the annotation attribute source code into your project, but that also isnt an option for this project.p  pIs there any way to tell ReSharper to stop adding annotations entirely Ive tried in the options unchecking JetBrains.Annotations as a namespace with code annotation attributes, but that doesnt seem to have any effect on whether the annotations are generated in the first place.p  pstrongUpdatestrong While I wasnt actually referencing JetBrains.Annotations.dll, I was referencing another DLL that reimplemented the same annotation attributes in the same JetBrains.Annotations namespace. Removing that DLL reference will prevent ReSharper from adding the annotations. Itd be nice if there was still an option to turn this off, but the workaround fits for this situation.p

Negative 2 pHere is my problem big picture. I have a project which uses large and complicated by which I mean contains multiple levels of nested structures Matlab structures. This is predictably slow especially when trying to load  save. I am attempting to improve runtimes by converting some of these structures into Java Objects. The catch is that the data in these Matlab structures is accessed in a LOT of places, so anything requiring a rewrite of access syntax would be prohibitive. Hence, I need the Java Objects to mimic as closely as possible the behavior of Matlab structures, particularly when it comes to accessing the values stored within them the values are only set in one place, so the lack of operator overloading in java for setting isnt a factor for consideration.p  pThe problem small picture that I am encountering lies with accessing data from an array of these structures. For example,p  precodeperson1   .age  20   .name     .first  John     .last  Smith  person2   .age  25   .name     .first  Jane     .last  Doe codepre  pMatlab will allow you to do the following,p  precodegtgtage  [person12.age] age       20    25 codepre  pAttempting to accomplish the same with Java,p  precodegtgtjperson  javaArraymyMatlab.Person, 2 gtgtjperson1  Person20, NameJohn, Smith gtgtjperson2  Person25, NameJane, Doe gtgtage  [jperson12.age]  No appropriate method or public field age for class myMatlab.Person[] codepre  pstrongIs there any way that I can get the Java object to mimic this behaviorstrong  The first thought I had was to simply extend the a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavasespecsjlsse7htmljls10.htmljls10.8 relnofollowPerson[] classa, but a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8546500whyisntthereajavalangarrayclassifajavaarrayisanobjectshouldntthis doesnt appear to be possible because it is final.a My second approach was to create a wrapper class containing an ArrayList of Person, however I dont believe this will work either because callingp  precodewrappedPerson12 codepre  pwould either be interpreted as a constructor call to a wrappedPerson class or an attempt to access elements of a nonexistent array of WrappedPerson since java wont let me override a  operator. Any insight would be greatly appreciated.p  pThe code I am using for my java class isp  precodepublic class Person    int age   ArrayListltNamegt names    public Personint age, Name name      age  age     names.addname       public int age return age   public void ageint age age  age   public Name[] name return names.toArraynew Name[0]   public void nameName name  names.addname   public class Name    String first   String last    public NameString first, String last      first  first     last  last       public int first return first   public void firstString firstName first  firstName   public int last return last   public void lastString lastName last  lastName  codepre

Negative 2 pI created a new thread to handle my TCP management needs. I did this in order to keep the UI thread active while its doing all sorts of socket magic. The problem Im having is that the variable num used in ServerThread doesnt seem to updating within the handler.posts run method. It changes once but subsequent iterations within my whiletrue loop no longer changes its value. However, outside handler.post I noticed that it is changing properly. I have included a log command for logcat in order to see the values of num so thats why I know this is what is happening. The thing is, I need the variable num inside the run method to update a few things in the UI thread. p  pMay be theres something wrong with the way I declared num.

Negative 2 pThis question is related to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15785087uploadarduinocodeonvirtualserialportthrougharduinoideUpload Arduino code on virtual serial port through Arduino IDEa. The main problem is being able to upload code onto virtual COM port instead of using Arduino so I could take the binary code output and use it in some other application. The problem with that is that the process of uploading is also related to the bootloader on the Arduino and thats why the upload process never reaches 100. The suggested solution was either to implement a bootloader in my application or use something that is already out there. p  pMy question now is can I make use of the different programmer modes in the Arduino IDE to sort of bypass the bootloader so the upload process can reach 100 and the code would actually reach the virtual COM port p  pAny help would be highly appreciated. Thanksp

Negative 2 pWe are currently seeing a problem where mobile devices that surf to our website dont seem to get picked up, not with page view or in realtime or in the events tracking. This all happened since March 15th but we are only now really starting to notice it. Debugging the analytics code snipped based on this a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comanalyticsresourcesarticlesgaTrackingTroubleshooting relnofollowhttpsdevelopers.google.comanalyticsresourcesarticlesgaTrackingTroubleshootinga was no problem on desktop but how do you do that on a mobile device. Android Phone or iPhone. Is there any way to debug the tracking code on the phone to make sure it works We had been successfully using ga.js with async snytax without problems for a good long while.p
Negative 2 pI came upon an interesting scenario with flow control while working on my language. What happens if an exception is thrown while processing a codebreakcode statement. GCC seems to believe the break flow is lost, but the standard seems somewhat silent on what should happen.p  pFor example, what should the following program actually dop  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt using namespace std  struct maybefail      bool fail     maybefail          if fail              throw 1        int main      for int i0 i lt 6 i           cout ltlt Loop  ltlt i ltlt endl          try              maybefail mf             mf.fail  i  2             if i  3                  break           catch int               cout ltlt Caught ltlt endl                   return 0  codepre  pNote that a codereturncode will also be blocked, as will a codecontinuecode add output after the catch to see that. Attempt to codegotocode outside of the block will also be caught.p  pWhat is the correct flow The standard doesnt seem to address this section 6.6 on jump statements makes no mention, neither does section 15 on exception handling. I do understand that exceptions in destructors is in terribly bad form, but if you are using something like BOOSTSCOPEEXIT for defer statements this behaviour might become quite important.p  pemPerhaps of interest, the same flow happens in Java and Python, so at least there seems to be some consistency in the imperative languages.emp

Negative 2 pI embedded Windows Media Player in a WinForms application and I need to retrieve the duration of the video, which is stored in axWindowsMediaPlayer1.currentMedia.durationp  pThe problem is that after I load a video the value will remain 0 until user action occurs.

Otherwise, it remains 0.p  pWhy is this and how can I solve itp  pThanksp  pIm using Windows 7 Enterprise with Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate and Windows Media Player 12p
Negative 2 pHow can I identify a specific call to a function automaticallyp  pThis example is simplified, I have somewhat better reasons for wanting this than it would appear from the example.p  pIf I have code that looks like thisp  precode... myObj.method1locationA, otherParams ... myObj.method1locationB, unrelatedParams ... codepre  pI would like to know how I can automatically generate the identifiers to use in place of locationA and locationB so that I can tell which line of code is doing the calling.p  pIt is not an option to hardcode an identifer for each location, and it cannot be, for example, a number that is incremented. It has to be the same identifier generated for the same function call each time.p  pMy thoughts are that we might be able to use reflection though I dont know if something like the IL line number is available, but Im open to any other ideas about how to do this, as long as it meets the conditions above.p  pThanks for your help.p  hr  h2More Infoh2  pThe inquirer is a colleague of mine and the answers provided seem to solve the issue, but in case there are better options Ill provide some additional information. The reason we want to identify a specific location is that we are prompting sending a message back to the user to interact with between server side code c and client side code JavaScript. If we have a series of prompts based on the state of the application, say, the first prompt happens if something is locked in the database and asks the user what to do cancel, for example, and the second prompt occurs after. We need to process the first one before moving to the second, so we exit the server code passing back the first prompt. p  pWhen we code the prompt we dynamically assign an ID for it in this case currently autoincrementing an ID, to avoid hardcoding i.e. 1, 2, 3, or guids, etc. This dynamic identification resets each time we call the method in question so that the IDs are consistent the first prompt has an id of 1, the second, 2.p  pThe idea is that when the user answers and retries, we assign the answers to a list and call the operation that then matches the prompt answer in the list with the specific prompt located in the code. Then we move on to the next prompt and then repeat the same process.p  pHowever, if by the time we come back into the method with the two prompts, and the lock no longer exists first prompt, we dont branch to that section of the code theres a check for locks before the prompt. Thus, we jump to the second prompt, but that second prompt would autogenerate an ID of 1, not 2 and think it already has an answer when it does not.p  pIve highlighted the code that creates the ID and sees if there is an answer that matches the prompt ID the answer list is stored in codePromptHandlercodep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.combSxPQ.png altenter image description herep
Negative 2 pI am writing a javascript function to replace urls with embed code eg. youtube urls with a youtube video. Im thinking of using String.replace with the following callbackp  precode function replacermatch      if isYoutubeLink         return getYoutubeEmbedCode           repeat for other types of urls   codepre  pHowever, since getYoutubeEmbedCode makes an oembed api call, it is asynchronous and cannot return a value. How would I go about replacing all the urlsp  pEDIT I would also need to create a new node after the urls have been replaced with code so that the videos show up as actually videos and not just as html text. I think this means I would also need to know when all the async tasks have finished.p

Negative 2 pThe C .NET Framework 4.5 code Im working on is supposed to allow me to transfer text across an encrypted stream to another program. Ive created two simple programs to demonstrate my problem. EncryptionTestA is the server, and is meant to run first. EncryptionTestB is the client and is meant to run second. Once EncryptionTestB connects, it transfers the text hello world to the other program by passing it through a CryptoStream. At least in theory.p  pWhat actually happens is nothing. I confirmed this by watching for data transfer with Wireshark on the internal interface. This code transfers absolutely no data in its present form. The only way I was able to get it to send hello world was to close the StreamWriter on the client side. The problem with this is that it also closes the underlying TCP connection, which I dont want to do.p  pSo, my question  how do I flush the StreamWriterCryptoStream without closing the underlying TCP connectionp  precodeusing System using System.Collections.Generic using System.Linq using System.Text using System.Threading.Tasks using System.IO using System.Collections using System.Threading using System.Security using System.Security.Cryptography using System.Net using System.Net.Sockets  namespace EncryptionTestA      class Program              static void Mainstring[] args                      TcpListener listener  new TcpListenerIPAddress.Parse127.0.0.1, 1892             listener.Start             TcpClient client  listener.AcceptTcpClient             NetworkStream ns  client.GetStream              Rijndael aes  RijndaelManaged.Create             byte[] key   0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04, 0x05, 0x06, 0x07, 0x08, 0x09, 0x10, 0x11, 0x12, 0x13, 0x14, 0x15, 0x16              byte[] iv   0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04, 0x05, 0x06, 0x07, 0x08, 0x09, 0x10, 0x11, 0x12, 0x13, 0x14, 0x15, 0x16              CryptoStream cs  new CryptoStreamns, aes.CreateDecryptorkey, iv, CryptoStreamMode.Read              StreamReader sr  new StreamReadercs              String test  sr.ReadLine              Console.Read              sr.Close             cs.Close             ns.Close             client.Close             listener.Stop                codepre  hr  precodeusing System using System.Collections.Generic using System.Linq using System.Text using System.Threading.Tasks using System.IO using System.Collections using System.Threading using System.Security using System.Security.Cryptography using System.Net using System.Net.Sockets  namespace EncryptionTestB      class Program              static void Mainstring[] args                      TcpClient client  new TcpClient             client.ConnectIPAddress.Parse127.0.0.1, 1892             NetworkStream ns  client.GetStream              Rijndael aes  RijndaelManaged.Create             byte[] key  0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04, 0x05, 0x06, 0x07, 0x08, 0x09, 0x10, 0x11, 0x12, 0x13, 0x14, 0x15, 0x16             byte[] iv  0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04, 0x05, 0x06, 0x07, 0x08, 0x09, 0x10, 0x11, 0x12, 0x13, 0x14, 0x15, 0x16             CryptoStream cs  new CryptoStreamns, aes.CreateEncryptorkey, iv, CryptoStreamMode.Write              StreamWriter sw  new StreamWritercs              sw.WriteLinehello world             sw.Flush             sw.Close              Console.Read              sw.Close             cs.Close             ns.Close             client.Close                codepre

Negative 2 pI have an app that allows users to forward SMS messages as they are received. Back in the day,  I had the codeandroidprioritycode in my codeintentfiltercode for codeandroid.provider.Telephony.SMSRECEIVEDcode  set to barely above Androids default messaging app. I did so, so that the user can forward the messages without having to clear them in the messaging app. However, a few months later, Go SMS Pro released an update of their app with a codeandroidprioritycode value extremely high, so users with that app installed started having issues. I updated my app so that my priority was slightly higher than Go SMS Pros and everything went fine. Now Go SMS Pro did it again, their codeandroidprioritycode has been taken up to the max value you can assign. 2147483647 on one of their broadcast receivers and 2147483640 on another yes, Go SMS Pro has two broadcast receivers now.p  pTo fix this, I tried changing my priority to max just like theirs, but somehow their app keeps wining the SMS fight even though our priorities are the same. I read somewhere that Android when having to decide between two apps with the same priority, it chooses the one installed the earliest. I tried installing Go SMS Pro AFTER my app, but still nothing.p  pWhats the proper way to fix this What are they doing in their app that makes them get the SMS broadcast before anyone else, even with same codeandroidprioritycode valuesp

Negative 2 pIs there a good way to share a multiprocessing Lock between gunicorn workers I am trying to write a json API with Flask.  Some of the API calls will interact a python class that manages a running process like ffmpeg for video conversion.  When I scale up my number of web workers to more than 1, how can I ensure that only 1 worker is interacting with the class at the same timep  pMy initial thought was to use multiprocessing.Lock so the start function can be atomic.  I dont think Ive figured out the right place to create a Lock so that one is shared across all the workersp  precode runserver.py from flask import Flask from werkzeug.contrib.fixers import ProxyFix import dummy  app  Flaskname  app.route def hello     dummy.start     return ffmpeg started  app.wsgiapp  ProxyFixapp.wsgiapp  if name  main     app.run codepre  pHere is my dummy operationp  precode dummy.py from multiprocessing import Lock import time  lock  Lock  def start     lock.acquire       TODO do work     for i in range0,10         print did work s  i         time.sleep1      lock.release codepre  pWhen I refresh the page a few times, I see the output from each call woven together.p  pAm I barking up the wrong tree here Is there an easier way to make sure that only copy of the processing class here just the dummy start method gets run at the same time  I think I might need something like celery to run tasks and just use only 1 worker but that seems a bit overkill for my small project.p

Negative 2 pFor example, with Ch k I can ask to Emacs what does Cright do in this buffer. If the current buffer was a Lisp buffer in my setup, Emacs would answer pareditforwardslurpsexp. From that, I can guess that the binding of Cright to pareditforwardslurpsexp is from the paredit mode map because the command name is prefixed by paredit, but thats a heuristic. How can I do that programatically, i.e., how can I ask where is the binding of Cright in this buffer coming fromp  pIs writing a function that in this case checks current global map, current major mode map, pareditmodemap, pareditforwardmodemap, pareditforwardslurpmodemap, pareditforwardslurpsexpmodemap the only wayp

Negative 2 pWere designing an internalonly library that will serve as a core business object model for several upcoming applications. It covers mostly Customers of various types and Documents of various types.p  pObviously we want to ensure that if youre going to use these objects, and especially if youre going to serialize them, that they have valid, sane values.p  pSo for instance, a Customer has contact info, and that includes a phone number. So theres an codeITelephoneNumbercode interface, base class, a US implementation, all that. The library uses these classes to validate its data. p  pBut really, a Customer is a more of a core business object for us, and a PhoneNumber less so it feels a little weird writing a bunch of structure for phone numbers, and exposing that as OurLibraryGoodness. They seem out of scope a bit.p  pPhone numbers are one example there are other things. We could refactor these class structures to static methods but then we have lengthy constructors and they have to just know to use the methods, etc. We made the decision to go with classes for a lot of this.p  h2My question ish2  pShould the library emconsumersem have to work with these helper classes that arent really necessary to emdefineem the core objects As in  precodeMyCustomer.SetTelephoneNumbernew USTelephoneNumber555, 555, 5555ampcodepre which give you compiletime feedback, their own members AreaCode, Exchange... and so on.p  pOr should we just leave the means of getting a valid phone number up to the implementation, and be more black box about it As in  precodeMyCustomer.SetTelephoneNumber5555555555ampcodepre which would just throw an error or silently failsucceed or return a string.Empty or whatever.p  hr  pI dont know if this question can be answered, and I dont want to start any holy wars. Im looking for some reasoning either way. Were just a 2man team trying to do the right thing in an agency that couldnt care less about code quality or maintainability.p
Negative 2 pI am using a codeUIPageViewControllercode to scroll through some view controllers. However, I need to dismiss the codeUIPageViewControllercode at the beginning and end of the array of view controllers, ie, if while scrolling through page view controller, if we have reached the boundary of the view controller array, dismiss the view controller.p  pFor the dismiss, I am using a codeUIPanGestureRecognizercode called codedismissPanGestureRecognizercode. This works wonderfully when the transition style of UIPageViewController is codeUIPageViewControllerTransitionStylePageCurlcode. In that case I can hook up my gestures like sop  pin codeviewDidLoadcodep  precode[pageViewController.gestureRecognizers enumerateObjectsUsingBlockUIGestureRecognizer gR, NSUInteger idx, BOOL stop     gR.delegate  self     [dismissPanGestureRecognizer requireGestureRecognizerToFailgR] ]  self.view.gestureRecognizers  self.pageViewController.gestureRecognizers codepre  pFor the codeUIGestureRecognizerDelegatecode methods, its something like thisp  precode BOOLgestureRecognizerShouldBeginUIGestureRecognizer gestureRecognizer       If we are at the left boundary and this is a pan gesture going rightleft,      return NO      Else If we are at the right boundary and this is a pan gesture going leftright,      return NO      Else return YES  codepre  pSo far so good. If its a pan gesture, we use it to dismiss only if page view controller gestures are not interested in it.p  pThe problem occurs when the transition style is codeUIPageViewControllerTransitionStyleScrollcode. In that case the codeUIPageViewControllercode dont have any gesture recognizers. It looks like it gets implemented using an internal view pageViewController.view.subviews called codeUIQueuingScrollViewcode which I would rather not muck around with. What happens is that in scrolling transition type, at the boundary of the view controller, the scroll view just bounces, and the pan gesture recognizer never gets fired for dismissal.  I had tried setting the codebouncescode property of UIQueuingScrollView to NO, and then the pages dont even change.p  pNext I tried adding a transparent codeUIViewcode on top of the codeUIPageViewControllercode view and then implementing codehitTestwithEventcode on that, thinking I will forward the event to pageViewController only when it is not at the boundaries. But while it does give some degree of control on when to allow pages to turn, it stops other gestures to get passed to pageController views too like tapping on a button, etc.p  pI am trying to find ways on how I can get my own UIPanGestureRecognizer to get fired when I reach the boundary of a UIPageViewController UIPageViewControllerDataSource methods returns codenilcode, when the transition style is codeUIPageViewControllerTransitionStyleScrollcode.p  pI am currently testing on iOS6iOS7.p

Negative 2 pI have searched the Internets for a couple of days, but cant find what Im looking for.p  pI am building an SPA using angularjs but Im struggling with something I think should be quite basic. Coming from a codeASP.NET MVCcode mindset, I am trying to set up routes for listing data and creating new data, for examplep  precode.stateplacements,      abstract true,     url placements,     template ltdiv uiviewgtltdivgt  .stateplacements.list,      url ,     templateUrl mapPathToViewsplacements.list,     controller PlacementController  .stateplacements.new,      url new,     templateUrl mapPathToViewsplacements.new,     controller PlacementController  codepre  pSo with these states set up, I would think that navigating to codeplacementsnewcode would give me the new placements view. p  pstrongThis works perfectly if I use the uisref navigationstrongp  pThe problem comes from when I type codemyapp.complacementsnewcode into a browser and hit GO, no route is matched at all. However, if I go to codemyapp.complacementscode I see the correct view as expected.p  pMy question is this Am I right in how I think the router should be set up or do I need to have a completely separate state for new placements, such as codemyapp.comnewplacementcodep  h2Updateh2  pIt seems to be something to do with the way uirouter figures out the state on first page load. If I load the page with the url codemyapp.complacementsnewcode, then click on a navigation item which points to a state with the url of codecode meaning home page, right then the url becomes codemyapp.complacementscode and the view for the home page is rendered. Similarly, if I click another nav link pointing to codesomewhereelsecode the url becomes codemyapp.complacementssomewhereelsecode and the codesomewhereelsecode view is rendered. Im guessing then that when it loads codeplacementsnewcode it for some reason is actually looking for a root state with the url of codenewcode which doesnt exist. p  pThis is proven when I add codeurlRouterProvider.otherwisenotfoundcode and reload the page at codeplacementsnewcode, the url becomes codemyapp.complacementsnotfoundcode. p  pIs this a bug sorry, undocumented feature or have I got something wrong here p  h2Another Update.h2  pOk, this is doing my head in now.p  pI figured Id have a go at hacking something to get around this, and thought Id get away with adding a codenewcode state and just calling codestate.transitionToplacements.newcode and all will be well. Turns out that if I do that, the url becomes codemyapp.complacementsplacementsnewcode  wtf p

What i am trying to do is that i am using only GPGGA NMEA string to get the values of Latitude, longitude and altitude.In my below code, i had put certain checks to check if incoming string is GPGGA or not, and then store the further string in a array which can be further parsed suing strtok function and all the 3 GPS coordinates can be easily find out.p  pBut i am unable to figure out how to store only GPGGA string and not the further string.I am using a for loop but it isnt working.p  pI am not trying to use any library.I had came across certain a hrefhttpplayground.arduino.ccTutorialsGPS relnofollowexisting codes like this.ap  pa hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiNMEA0183 relnofollowHere is the GPGGA string information linkap  pi am trying to have following functionlity i Check if incoming string is GPGGA ii If yes, then store the following string upto EOL or upto  followed by checksum for the array in a array, array length is variablei am unable to find out solution for this iii Then parse the stored arraythis is done, i tried this with a different arrayp  precode include ltSoftwareSerial.hgt      SoftwareSerial mySerial10,11   10 RX  11 TX      void setup          Serial.begin9600     mySerial.begin9600           void loop          uint8t x     char gpsdata[65]      ifmySerial.available          char c  mySerial.read     ifc         char c1  mySerial.read        ifc1  G          char c2  mySerial.read           ifc2  P             char c3  mySerial.read              ifc3  G                char c4  mySerial.read                 ifc4  G                    char c5  mySerial.read                     ifc5  A                        forx0xlt65x                                                   gpsdata[x]mySerial.read       while gpsdata[x]  r  gpsdata[x]  n                                          break                                                                                                else                           Serial.printlnNot a GPGGA string                                                                                                               Serial.printlngpsdata      codepre  pEdit 1 Considering  Joachim Pileborg, editing the for loop in the code.p  pI am adding a pic to show the undefined output of the code.p  pInput for the codep  precodeGPGGA,092750.000,5321.6802,N,00630.3372,W,1,8,1.03,61.7,M,55.2,M,,76 GPGSA,A,3,10,07,05,02,29,04,08,13,,,,,1.72,1.03,1.380A GPGSV,3,1,11,10,63,137,17,07,61,098,15,05,59,290,20,08,54,157,3070 GPGSV,3,2,11,02,39,223,19,13,28,070,17,26,23,252,,04,14,186,1479 GPGSV,3,3,11,29,09,301,24,16,09,020,,36,,,76 GPRMC,092750.000,A,5321.6802,N,00630.3372,W,0.02,31.66,280511,,,A43 GPGGA,092751.000,5321.6802,N,00630.3371,W,1,8,1.03,61.7,M,55.3,M,,75 GPGSA,A,3,10,07,05,02,29,04,08,13,,,,,1.72,1.03,1.380A GPGSV,3,1,11,10,63,137,17,07,61,098,15,05,59,290,20,08,54,157,3070 GPGSV,3,2,11,02,39,223,16,13,28,070,17,26,23,252,,04,14,186,1577 GPGSV,3,3,11,29,09,301,24,16,09,020,,36,,,76 GPRMC,092751.000,A,5321.6802,N,00630.3371,W,0.06,31.66,280511,,,A45 codepre

Negative 2 pI have a simple gridview that I would like to use to update a SQL table.  I have the gridview set up using template fields.  The first 5 columns are data report fields like customer, job name etc.  These fields will not be editable.  The next fields are all date fields.  The user will edit a row and add the date for the activity.  The first column is import date, so the user would enter 1242013.  I was thinking it would be nice to have a date picker.  With over 10 stages that need to be reported, this may make the edit very difficult.  So in lieu of a date picker is there a way to check that the user has entered a valid date format at the time of entry  If the user entered 1242013 US date format, this would be acceptable.  But if they entered 12322013 it would reject the date as not a valid datep  pBelow is the code for how I have the template fields set up in the gridview for the first 5 columns.  I was hoping to use this to create the edit templates.p  precodeltaspTemplateField HeaderTextPagesgt ltItemTemplategt ltaspLabel IDlblPages runatserver Textlt EvalPagesgtgt ltaspLabelgt ltItemTemplategt ltHeaderStyle Width60px HorizontalAlignCentergt ltItemStyle Width60px HorizontalAlignRight gt ltaspTemplateFieldgt codepre

Negative 2 pIm writing an app that behaves normally in Android 4.3 but does not in 4.4.2.   The issue is that with Accessibility Talk Back feature turned on you should be able to explore by touch over the buttons of your app and have it announce the contentDescription.   p  pThis works fine in 4.3 but in 4.4.2 only the navigation drawer and items on it announce themselves. The rest of the app is all buttons and a fragment on the main activity. p  pI should point out that the main activity uses TextToSpeech, Im worried there is a new conflict here.  p  pHas anyone else seen this problem   Any suggestions on a solution p  pThanks, Chuck Brandtp

Negative 2 pAs per java docs,p  blockquote   pIn general, a Writer sends its output immediately to the underlying   character or byte stream.

For example,p      pPrintWriter out  new PrintWriternew BufferedWriternew   FileWriterfoo.outp      pwill buffer the PrintWriters output to the file.

Negative 2 pI am having trouble getting file uploads to work reliably using both Uploadify and Uploadifive I have fallback configured when browser does not support Uploadifive.p  pMost times, all files upload ok to the destination directly. However, randomly, one file in the queue wont appear in the destination directly all others appear during a multifile selection. Note auto is set to true.p  pThe missing file will still show visibly in the queue on the page, but wont have been uploaded.p  pInvestigating the POST in Firebug shows most files being sent to the upload script are including both the file data and the token variable. But the single file that doesnt work isnt sending either the file data or the token POST for that file upload is 0KB.p  pThe behaviour is unfortunately sporadic or at least I cant work out the pattern.

Negative 2 pUsing EnterpriseDBs GUI installer, I installed Postgres 9.3.5 on my Mac running Mavericks. I selected the option to install spatial components and PostGIS 2.1.3 was installed automatically. After enabling the PostGIS extension, I was able to perform geography calculations as expected. I then discovered the STGeomFromGeoJSON function because Im a noob, tried to use it, and realized that I needed to install JSONC, which I did.p  pThe a hrefhttppostgis.netdocsmanual2.1STGeomFromGeoJSON.html relnofollowPostGIS documentationa says To enable JSONC, run configure withjsondirpathtojsonc. See Section 2.4.1, Configuration for details. The Configuration section is all about installing PostGIS from scratch.p  pSo, two questions 1. Can I enable JSONC for PostGIS without rebuilding PostGIS 2. If not, how can I ensure my new PostGIS install includes all the features that were installed automatically the first time I had no visibility into what the installer was doing, so I dont know which, if any, of the 12 with options were used.p  pI am brand new to PostgresPostGIS and fairly new to commandline wizardry. All help is appreciated.p
Negative 2 pIn a few projects Im working on, Ive noticed that when onetomany relationships are nested in an API response, relationship mapping is taking a very long time and causing a bottleneck on some loading screens.  I profiled the issue in instruments and there wasnt a single method that stood out, just several methods related to relationship mapping.  This issue persists even when core data is not being used.  Im wondering if there are any settings, methods, or properties I could make use of to speed up the relationship mapping process.  p  pI created a test project to highlight the issues.  The project has a test suite that uses RestKit and OHHTTPStubs to map some json fixtures into an array of custom objects.  The test project repo can be found here a hrefhttpsgithub.comrtimponerestkitrelationshipmappingbenchmarking relnofollowhttpsgithub.comrtimponerestkitrelationshipmappingbenchmarkinga.  The data model used is simple, but makes use of a onetomany relationship.  It does not use core data.  I benchmark the results of RestKit relationship mapping against manual mapping just as a reference point, I do not expect relationship mapping to be as quick as manual mapping.  p  pIs there anything I can do when setting up RestKit or object mappings that would make relationship mapping quicker  Is there some step Im missing in setting up my mappings or response descriptors  Is this performance typical when mapping nested relationships  Any help or suggestions on this topic would be greatly appreciated.  p

Negative 2 pI have written several classes that all need to be instantiated when used.p  pMy goal was to be able to have the perfect organization when trying to create dynamic access between instantiated classes.p  pIn one class it would have several methods it calls based on what it just did. Inside one of these methods would be methods from other classes. Currently static methods I would edit these lines to control the behavior between classes.p  pWhat i mean by being dynamic is, if one of the static methods is not available or will be available later, then it simply executes a different method to complete the task internally.p  pMy question is a matter of concern of proper OOP. I am not sure if there is a better way or if what im doing can cause problems. Although, it works pretty well.p  pI have an example prepared below.

Negative 2 pIve got a small Hadoop CDH5.1.0, MRv2YARN cluster 5x nodes 4CPU, 16GB RAM, 600GB disk of which contains a small number 30 of 15GB SequenceFiles. The SequenceFiles contains pairs of codeBytesWritablecodecodeBytesWritablecode, and the keys are not uniformly distributed across the possible keyspace  its rather lumpy. However, these files are sorted.p  pI need to merge these together to create a single, sorted SequenceFile, as efficiently as possible. Ive tried a number of approaches already, but havent been very successful. p  pInitially, I tried using a MapReduce job with a RandomSampler and TotalOrderPartitioner, and around 1000 Reducers. However, it turns out that because of the nonuniformity of the input keys, the RandomSampler isnt very good at distributing the data across the partitions, and I end up with 999 reducers succeeding, and 1 failing due to running out of local disk.p  pIt occurs to me that this approach doesnt appear to take advantage of the fact that the input data is already sorted  it would solve the problem if my input data were in a Random order. p  pI notice that theres a SequenceFile.Sorter class that aims to simply merge SequenceFiles together into a single sorted output. While this would be a singlethreaded process, would this be better than the MR approach Is there a different MR approach I could take that could exploit the fact that my input data is already sorted It would seem that the fastest way to do this would be to do a simple merge, but is there a way I could do this in parallel across the clusterp

Negative 2 pIve been learning to develop against the Android source tree, and while things are going well Im not sure Ive completed things in the most efficient way to merge into future versions.p  pstrongBackgroundstrong Android has many repositories that fit together. In some cases, a repo uses branches with names like android5.0.0r6 to delineate a specific release. In other cases, that branch doesnt exist, instead, a tag exists with the name android5.0.0r6.p  pstrongMy methodstrong What Ive done is create a new branch, called nowsci5.0.0r6 based off the branch or tag depending on which that repo had for the repositories I needed to modify. I then made my changes, and pointed the android manifest at my new repos and everything seems to work fine.p  pstrongMy questionstrong What should I do when android5.0.0strongr7strong rolls out Is there an easy way to create a new branch of nowsci5.0.0r7 and merge my modifications from r6 into r7 Or should I have done this completely differentp  pHeres one of the repos for example a hrefhttpsgithub.comFmstratplatformframeworksbase relnofollowhttpsgithub.comFmstratplatformframeworksbaseap  pThanks.p

Negative 2 pIm creating a flashcardtype game to help in learning a new language. Now the actual language Im trying to use in my program is Urdu, but when I look at a unicode chart Arabic and Urdu letters are mixed together and I thought more people would know what Im talking about if I said Arabic.p  pSo, on my Windows 8 machine I can change the keyboard layout to Urdu and whatever I type into Java is correctly displayed back to me. However transferring this code to another computer with Windows 7 at my school changes the Urdu characters in the raw Java file to oddcharactersmumbojumbo. Coping and pasting the character from the online unicode chart displays in the java file, but is shown as a  in the actual program itself, and in the System.out method.p  pNow when I use the unicode escape commands ex. uXXXX these are displayed correctly on both computers. p  pThe problem is that I dont want to use escape commands every time I want to write something in Urdu. I plan on writing long sentences and many words. So I was thinking of making an array of the unicode codes and then perhaps a method that converts a English string of letters into Urdu using this array but I thought there must be an easier way to fix this problem.p  pIm still kinda a beginner, but I wasnt planning on making a very complex program anyway. For any help, thanks.p

Negative 2 pRelatively new to C, looking for the best practice way of doing the followingp  pI have a class sensor with public methods such as CommunicationStart, DoThing1, DoThing2.p  pBefore calling these methods, the class is configured with a sensor Modelp  pBased on the model, the public methods should take different code paths.  If I were to do this statically, a switch on model in each public method would do the trick.p  pI want to do this dynamically to aide long term support.  What is the proper approach to wrapping dynamically loaded code in each of the public methods  Reflection  Delegates  Where should the dynamically loaded functions reside  Should they be in the same class as their public wrappers, or reside in a new classp  pIm looking more for the correct approach, and organization, not syntax, as I can sort that out myself.

Negative 2 pIm trying to consume my WCF webservice via an MVC Web Application. I add a service reference via the Add service reference dialogue in VS. Now when I try to call my proxy.LoginUser I get the error messagep  pOperation GetAlertNotification of contract IService1 specifies multiple request body parameters to be serialized without any wrapper elements. At most one body parameter can be serialized without wrapper elements. Either remove the extra body parameters or set the BodyStyle property on the WebGetAttributeWebInvokeAttribute to Wrapped.p  pThe only problem is there is no body parameters in GetAlertNotification If I understand correctly if I pass all parameters via the query string this should not be an issue Here is the signature of GetAlertNotification in IServicep  precode    [OperationContract]     [WebInvokeMethod  GET, UriTemplate  GetAlertNotificationprojectprojectampcurrentversioncurrentversionampEncryptDataEncryptData, RequestFormat  WebMessageFormat.Json, ResponseFormat  WebMessageFormat.Json]     AlertNotification GetAlertNotificationstring project, string currentversion, bool EncryptData  false codepre  pEdit I replaced WebInvoke by WebGet and still get the error message above.

Negative 2 pIm a novice programmer in Java. Im currently doing webcam based automation.p  pDetails of project Webcam is running on a Linux based machine. This webcam would send me pictures via TCPIP. I get the picture of a component and display it in one half of the window. I need to open a autocad file of the same component in the other half of the window. Ill rotate the 3d file such that it matches with the view of the photograph. Then, I need to trace some points on the photograph and send those points back to the Linux machine.p  pProcess flow Im using Processing IDE to establish connection and get the file. Once file is downloaded, it will be displayed on one half of the window. Then, the mouseClicked event will record the points on the image and send it back to the Linux machine.p  pWork done so far TCPIP connection has been established to a telnet session for simulation.

I read somewhere that I would be able to get the default allocator for the list, and allocate space on it ahead of time, so I tried allocating space in one of the listsp  precodeqcB.getallocator.allocate100000 codepre  pI am unsure if this was supposed to work or not, but the truth is that the emplaceback is taking the same amount of time with both the lists, even though one of them is allocating space beforehand.p  pIs this supposed to work Should this be done in a different way, instead of trying to allocate space in the default allocator I am clearing the lists from time to time, may this be affecting the allocated spacep  pThank you for your help.p

Negative 2 pWe have nightly load jobs that writes several hundred thousand records to an Mysql reporting database running in Amazon RDS. p  pThe load jobs are taking several hours to complete, but I am having a hard time figuring out where the bottleneck is. p  pThe instance is currently running with General Purpose SSD storage. By looking at the cloudwatch metrics, it appears I am averaging less than 50 IOPS for the last week. However, Network Receive Throughput is less than 0.2 MBsec. p  pIs there anyway to tell from this data if I am being bottlenecked by network latency we are currently loading the data from a remote server...this will change eventually or by Write IOPS p  pIf IOPS is the bottleneck, I can easily upgrade to Provisioned IOPS. But if network latency is the issue, I will need to redesign our load jobs to load raw data from EC2 instances instead of our remote servers, which will take some time to implement. p  pAny advice is appreciated. p  pstrongUPDATEstrong More info about my instance. I am using an m3.xlarge instance. It is provisioned for 500GB in size. The load jobs are done with the ETL tool from pentaho.

The ideal input behavior I am aiming for is calculator style. Typing in digits will go left of the decimal point until a period is typed, after which the remaining digits will go right of the decimal point.p  pThe input behavior I get is somewhat different. It will accept digits and the period decimal point, but doesnt care about placement, so I can end up with invalid string multiple decimal points. Its smart enough to know the string is invalid default black control border turns red, but not smart enough to edit the string as its being typed.p  pIs there any way the textbox can accept an input mask to achieve the calculatorstyle input behavior Im looking for, ideally without resorting to codebehind Is there a Nuget containing a control which implements the behavior Im afterp

Its important to notice  viewCount field is not indexed, its just stored in ES.p  pThe problem is that there are two terms  particial update and particial index. There is particial update in ES  you can change only a few fields. Bu there is no particial reindex  it means if you even change only one field ES will reindex entire document.It means that if topic is viewed 1000 times ES will index it 1000 times. And if I have a lot of users many documents will be indexed again and again. This is first strategy.p  pThe second strategy, as I think is to take some fields of topic from index and some from database. At this case I take viewAcount from DB. However, then I can store all fields in DB and use index only as INDEX  to get ids of current topic.p  pWhat is the best way to solve such problemp

Negative 2 pI have an IBM NotesXPages site, and Im trying to allow access to one of the pages to anyone.  This particular xpage is fairly simple, but it does call some java code that is sitting under CodeJava in Designer.  I know about the Public Access setting for design elements, and I think I have checked it for the xpage itself and the formview it uses.  It still doesnt execute the code on the page, and Im wondering if its because the java file doesnt have public access enabled.  If that might be the case, how does one go about enabling it  I dont see a security tab for the java file.  Thanksp  pThe reason for this, by the way, is so the xpage can be called by a scheduled agent.  Thats made debugging this a bit tricky.p

Negative 2 pIve been experiencing issues with some of my Simulink SFunction blocks. Each one of these blocks affects the performance of my code by about the same amount  independent of the actual computation that is performed within these blocks. And the performance effects are severep  pBy now Im confident that the issue is due to the fact that my blocks communicate via large bus objects 20kB. These bus objects are based on nested arrays and structures in C. The core of my problem seems to boil down to the fact that Im using the Matlab Legacy Code Tool LCT to generate SFunction blocks from my handwritten C code. And the LCT creates a memcpyoperation for each primitive field inside those huge buses.p  pI believe this is necessary because the input bus might be virtual meaning that every data entry might be located at some unknown location in memory. If I was able to make sure that all buses were nonvirtual their contents would be all placed in a single block in memory and the LCT could simplify the copyinstructions at the block interface  in theory. I believe this is how the sfunction builder block works but the builder has may other problems so Im not going to use it.p  pSo how do I configure the LCT top  ol limake the resulting block only accept nonvirtual buses as inputs andli lithus avoid 5000 memcpy operations in my generated cfile and replace these by a single operation li ol  pIm not a 100 certain that this would solve my issue. Im still a bit puzzled by the fact that the LCT also produces 5000 memcpy operations when transmitting the output bus objects. So other ideas are appreciated.p

Negative 2 pI have a codeConcurrentMapcode and I put elements from an codeArrayListcode to the map for other threads to process. Once a thread finishes its processing it adds the result in the codeConcurrentMapcode and calls a method in order for lets say the main thread to get and process all the results from both the codeConcurrentMapcode and the codeArrayListcode.br This approach works but has a result to call the method as many times as the number of elements in the list.br strongQuestionstrong What constructs can I use so that the method is called once, after the codeConcurrentMapcode is fully populated by the results of all background threadsp

Im quoting the answer p  blockquote   pUser Macros will only display under Common Properties if the property sheet that youre editing is specific to the projectsolution So what you need to do is open the Property Manager window in VS, rightclick on your project and add a new property sheet.

Negative 2 pIve created an remote ejb bean for an application of mine that runs on a wildfly server. Both, the server and the client that connects to the server, run on the same machine my local computer.  Now Ive seen observed, that from the beginning of the call to its return it takes a little over 500 milliseconds on average, but the call itself on the server side only needs 3 milliseconds.  These values were observed with the new java 8 datetime api both on the server and on the client side. What I now would like to know is, if its somehow possible to decrease the needed time until the client receives the result from the server. Unfortunatly I couldnt find any meaningfull informations to achieve this on the internet, which is the reason why I ask here.p  pOn another note, I also tried to use REST as a technology to make my server calls from the client, the needed time was almost the same with a difference of only 1  10 milliseconds to the ejb call. Because of this I would guess that the reason for the slow call is either the ejb object instantiation or the marshalling of the parameters or results of the calls. p  pThanks for your helpp  pBirop

Negative 2 pWhat would be the proper way of exposing stored procedures that do strongnotstrong return any entities, just do some actions on database, or return an object that is not mapped with Telerik Data Access p  pSay I have a table of people, and want to get the average of their age, I have a stored procedure to do that and I want to expose it using WebAPI. The stored procedure would return only the value then. The procedures I want to expose are more complex than that, but when I know the basics I would be able to do it alone, I suppose.p  pIve read Telerik Data Accesss documentation, but only mention on how to expose stored procedures is when the procedure returns an object that is already mapped in data model.p  pShould anyone know any tutorials on doing this, please share it here. Or if its not possible using Telerik Data Access can anyone provide a substitution for exposing databases stored procedures as WebAPI doesnt even need to be Cp  pIm working on legacy Firebird database, and actually only need those stored procedures to be exposed.p

Negative 2 pIs it possible to use .NET Rx Observable.FromEvent method or is there another method that allows to create an Observable from an event but calls add event handler only once when the first Subscribe method is called or when the FromEvent or similar method is called and dont call remove event when an Observer is unsubscribed but rather allows to remove the event manually.p  pI have a special situation. The library providing that event allows to add a handler or handlers only until a certain method on that object is called. After that trying to add another handler throws an exception. Thus, it seems that I cannot use FromEvent because produced Observable adds and removes event handler each time Subscribe is called and then Observer is unsubscribed.p  pWhat would be the best approach in this situationp

Negative 2 pI am still learning Java EE and I am facing a problem on how to display pictures. p  pLet me explain myslef. p  pI have a database which contains a table File that has the path and name of several files. all .JPG at the moment. p  pI would like to display them on the application, so I put them on a folder imgs in my app. p  pThe problem is, they arent shown on the screen. So I redeployed the app and then they appeared. p  pBut the problem is, the table File is dynamically filled, and the file folder too. This means that the application needs to be redeployed everytime a new file appears. So, I need to access the files without having to redeploy my app, or I have to automatically redeploy my application.p  pAnd for your information, the application cant reach the Internet, but the Internet can reach it.p  pWhat is the best way to do that, and how should I do  p  pThank youp

Negative 2 pIn Swift for iOS, I have a button that creates a view when clicked.  This view has an animation that starts out as a point underneath the button, and expands out into the middle of the screen.  I have 3 subviews in the view, a button, a scrollview, and a label.  I have been able to animate the button and scrollview so that they start at the same point as their parent view, and expand out to the center.  I am having an issue getting the label to do the same thing.  Instead of starting out from a point that is centered horizontally and underneath the button that creates the view, it starts out with full height and a longer width than what it ends with, and it starts in the upper right hand corner of the screen.

I change directories from the prompt, go to another directory and run another script usually the same csh file but with different parameters. I have to do this 25 times.

That way I can gain some time by running it overnight.p  precode binbash  cd devDFolder1   unzip file1.zip  ALRSHsomeonesscript.csh DIR PWD otherfilter blah1   cd devDFolder2   unzip file2.zip  ALRSHsomeonesscript.csh DIR PWD otherfilter blah2  . . .  and so on. codepre  pThanks and Im sorry if this is too vague.

Negative 2 pI am building a webpage that is part of a Symfony2 project. This page generates and displays an HTML table report according to what filters the user selected in the form. This is all well and good. I can display the report correctly in the browser according to what options the user chose.p  pDue to performance issues and to avoid needless complexity, I have limited the report to 2000 rows in length. Most of the time, this is sufficient.p  pHowever, sometimes the user needs to be able to view all 15 000 or 50 000 rows of the report. Displaying a 15 000 row report in the browser is simply not an option unless we add even more complexity to the project and introduce a lot more clientside code, which we are not willing to do. The other option is to simply allow the user to download the report as a .csv file. Sounds easy enough, eh Keep in mind that we will need to use this same approach for over a dozen different reports, so we dont want to have to reinvent the wheel for each one.p  pThere are a few different ways we can approach thisp  ol lipWe can generate the csv file at the same time as the HTML table is being generated and save it on the server, then provide a link to this file. This means we will end up with hundreds or thousands of files on the server that we would rather not have to deal with, and each page load time would be longer while the file that will only be downloaded perhaps 10 of the time is being generated.pli lipThe next option is to have two buttons on the form Update Report and Download Report. Pressing download would query the database and simultaneously fetch and stream the data to the user as a CSV file. This is the approach we want to try.pli ol  pStreaming the data for a static report where the user does not select any options isnt so difficult because no form would be involved, but how to get it so that the users selections are taken into account Using the approach below, pressing Download Report brings up the Save dialogue, but it appears that the browser doesnt accept the sent CSV the first time. When Save is clicked, however, the browser then sends emanotherem request. This time, however, there is no form data attached to it, so nothing happens or, the full HTML of the page is sent instead. strongHow can I make it so that when I press Download, it downloads correctly Or am I completely off trackstrongp  pHeres the Action method of the controllerp  precodepublic function indexActionRequest request      fields  new Fields     form  thisgtbuildFormfields     formgthandleRequestrequest     TODO validate form data      cursor  thisgtgetReportDatafields      if formgtgetdownloadgtisClicked              return thisgtgenerateCsvcursor          else              tableData  thisgtgenerateTableDatacursor          return thisgtrenderAcmeBundleDefaultcargoreport.html.twig,                             [tableData gt tableData, formgt formgtcreateView,]        codepre  pAnd heres the code I have for streaming the CSV file to the userp  precodeuse SymfonyComponentHttpFoundationStreamedResponse protected function generateCsvcursor      response  new StreamedResponse     responsegtsetCallbackfunction          handle  fopenphpoutput, w          while row  cursorgtfetch                       fputcsvhandle, [row[PALLETID],                              row[VESSELDESCRIPTION],                              row[QTYRECEIVED],                              row[QTYINHOUSE],                              row[CARGOSIZE],                              row[DATERECEIVED],                              row[TIMERECEIVED]],                   fclosehandle           responsegtsetStatusCode200     responsegtheadersgtsetContentType, textcsv charsetutf8     responsegtheadersgtsetContentDisposition,                             attachment filenamecargoreport.csv      return response  codepre  pThe rest of the controller is not really relevant to this question.p  pKudos to Furculita Alexandru for publishing hisher solution to a hrefhttpwww.designopsy.comsymfony2exportcsv relnofollowstreaming a CSV filea.p

Negative 2 pFirst of all, I am using Unity3d.p  pWhat is the most efficient in terms of memory way to create a group of 2D tiles with 2D colliders using a texture atlas and tile datap  pBackground Info I am working on a 2D terrain generation asset. It is a very similar generation style to Terrarias random generation. Currently, each tile is being instantiated as a separate GameObject. As I now know, this is extremely inefficient, and I should use a texture atlas and tile data instead. Here is a link to a tutorial I have been following that deals with this in 3D a hrefhttpstudentgamedev.blogspot.co.uk201308unityvoxeltutorialpart1generating.html relnofollowhttpstudentgamedev.blogspot.co.uk201308unityvoxeltutorialpart1generating.htmlap  pThe problem is that strongmesh colliders are 3D colliders 3D colliders CANNOT collide with 2D collidersstrong. Currently in Unity, there are no 2D colliders that I am aware of that have the properties of a mesh I need to dynamically change the 2D collider to adjust to the positions that contain tiles. How am I supposed to develop an efficient 2D tile system using 2D collidersp  pHere are some of my ideas of techniques that may workp  ul liAdd a box collider 2D component to the chunk GameObject for each tile in the chunk.li liSomehow dynamically use a polygon collider 2D to stretch over all solid tiles.li ul  pI have read through several threads and cannot find a good approach for this problem. I am mostly looking for a proven techniqueapproach to this issue, but I am open to any suggestions or techniques. I am happy to provide clarity as needed.

Negative 2 pIm looking for some best practices when it comes to modeling confidential hierarchical data in general and specifically with DynamoDB. p  pThe scenario is best explained with an example  Lets say we have a number of codeuserscode. Each codeusercode has a number of codeproductscode. Each codeproductcode consists of a number of codepartscode.p  pTypical use cases p  ul liList all codeproductscode for a given codeusercodeli liList all codepartscode for a given codeproductcodeli ul  pSo far I have modeled this in DynamoDB like thisp  precodeUsers  HashKey  UserId   Products  HashKey  UserId RangeKey ProductId   Parts  HashKey  ProductId RangeKey PartId codepre  pThe data is confidential and accessed through authenticated REST endpoints where an authentication token can be mapped to a codeUserIdcode. Each user emmayem be allowed to view other users data through some group concept.p  pListing all products for a given user is simple since codeUserIdcode is a key in the products tablep  pcodeGET users111productscode becomes a simple codeQueryTableProducts, UserId111codep  pBut consider the case of listing all parts for a given productp  pcodeGET users111products222partscodep  pIf I simply do a codeQueryTableParts, ProductId222code then I will get the desired data fast, but I am not protecting against other users querying for data belonging to user 111, provided they somehow know about codeProductIdcode 222 in reality, IDs will of course be UUIDs or similar so not so easily guessablep  pcodeGET users119products222partscodep  p... would result in malicious user 119 retrieving data that doesnt belong to him, provided nothing is done to address this. So here I imagine I need to do something like one of these p  ol liFirst make another query to make sure product 222 in fact belongs to the given userli liDuplicate the codeUserIdcode in the Parts table and include it in the query condition which basically means it will match either emallem rows or emnoem rows when scanning through the set identified by codeProductIdcode codeQueryTableParts, ProductId222, UserId111codeli liUse UserId as the hash key also in the Parts table and instead keep ProductId as a secondary indexli liUse a composite HashKey such as codeUserIdProductIdcode 111222 on the codePartscode tableli ol  pIf I need to return a 401 as opposed to just empty data, option 1 seems like the only approach. But if we imagine a deeper hierarchy of data, e.g. users having inboxes having messages having parts having attachments it seems this approach could eventually be expensive listing all attachments for part P might result in a query to check that part P belongs to message M, that message M belongs to inbox I and that inbox I belongs to user U, and so on.p  pDoes anyone have any good arguments for which approach is most favorable Or am I doing something stupid and should be modeling my data in some other way completelyp
