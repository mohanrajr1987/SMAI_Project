Negative 23577 pI have a button that when clicked opens a Popup. The Popup is a submenu containing more buttons. When one of the buttons on the submenu are clicked the Popup closes.

Its also important to note that the majority of the screen is taken up by a WindowsFormsHost that displays an OpenGL Win Forms control.p  pClosing the Popup when a submenu button is clicked Ive been able to do. Within the click handler for those buttons I close the Popup. However, closing the Popup when clicking somewhere else is where Ive run into a problem.p  pThings Ive triedp  pSetting PopUp.StaysOpen to false. This works in that when clicking elsewhere on the screen, the Popup closes. However, on the Win Forms control it seems to require a click to close the Popup then a second click to perform what ever action. This is very undesirable. p  pIve tried handling the LostFocus event for the button that opens the Popup and setting StaysOpen to true. This works in that clicking off the Popup doesnt require the second click on the Win Forms control. The problem now is that the LostFocus event is handled and the Popup closed before it reads a click on any buttons on the Popup. This makes the submenu unusable.p

Negative 23577 pOkay, so Im doing a little blowfish implementation in PHP as a programming exercise for myself, and to get to know that encryption method better. I arrived at a set of functions that work, in that I can encrypt data and decrypt it again, but the a hrefhttpwww.schneier.comcodevectors.txt relnofollowtest vectorsa I found dont agree with my encrypted values... Since the encodedecode seems to work, Im guessing the error is in my functions setup of applying the secret key to the P array and Sboxes, arriving at a different set of P values and Sbox values, so the encoded values are different. Can someone find where my logic is going awryp  pFor the test case of a key of 0x0000000000000000 and a text input of 0x0000000000000000, the first step is to XOR the key with the P array, but with a key of all zeroes, that will result in the P array being unchanged, so will still have the hex values of pi that it starts with. Then a 64byte text string 0x0000000000000000 is encoded using the current P array and Sboxes, and the result gets split to replace P1 and P2. Then that same output is encoded again using the new P1 and P2 values to get another output, which is used to replace P3 and P4. This continues until all the P values are changed, and the Sboxes. Doing that process, I get the following original values on the left, value after propagating through the secret key process on the rightp  precodeP1 243f6a88  99f2ff37 P2 85a308d3  9ce5cb96 P3 13198a2e  d8bf7d9a P4 03707344  eba1db37 P5 a4093822  5954010a P6 299f31d0  2b121658 P7 082efa98  e7a5b7ed P8 ec4e6c89  21a6717f P9 452821e6  b2bb1bf8 P10 38d01377  937f0244 P11 be5466cf  e111a3da P12 34e90c6c  67170ab6 P13 c0ac29b7  5d1db61b P14 c97c50dd  cdf63d96 P15 3f84d5b5  c4935141 P16 b5470917  ad859868 P17 9216d5d9  0ca32381 P18 8979fb1b  50964a67 S1,0 d1310ba6  a96eceb6 S1,1 98dfb5ac  3480051c S1,2 2ffd72db  8d315fa7 S1,3 d01adfb7  936c585a S1,4 b8e1afed  cd9cd593 ...

Negative 23577 pI am trying to prototype a space flight sim in OpenGL, but after reading many articles online I still have difficulty with getting the rotations to work correctly I did have a quaternion camera that I didnt understand well, but it drifts and has other odd behaviors.p  pI am trying to do the followingp  p1 Local rotation  when the user presses arrow keys, rotation occurs relative to the viewport rotating up is toward the top of the screen, for example. Two keys, such as Z and X, will control the roll of the ship rotation around the current view.p  p2 The rotations will be stored in Axisangle format which is most natural for OpenGL and a single rotate call with the camera vector should rotate the scene properly. Therefore, given the initial Angleaxis vector, and one or more of the local rotations noted above we could locally call X the leftright axis, Y the topbottom axis, and Z the roll axis, I would like the end result to be a new Axisangle vector.p  p3 Avoid quarternions and minimize the use of matrices for some reason I find both unintuitive. Instead of matrix notation please just show in psuedocode the vector components and whats happening.p  p4 You should be able to rotate in a direction using the arrow keys 360 degrees and return to the starting view without drifting. Preferably, if the user presses one combination and then reverses it, they would expect to be able to return to near their original orientation.p  p5 The starting state for the camera is at coordinates 0,0,0 facing the Axisangle vector 0,0,1,0  zaxis with no starting rotation. up is 0,1,0.p

Negative 23577 pI am looking for a better way to pass information between my Firefox extension and .NET application.  Currently, I am using text files to pass information one way to the .NET application by using the FileSystemWatcher class.  The .NET application watches for new files in a specific directory when the Firefox extension writes to it and then the information is stored in a local SQL Server database.  Now, I want to query for information from the FF extension, but I havnt come up with a good way of doing it, besides maybe using the clipboard. Using text files is a bit clunky, so any suggestions would be appreciated.  p

Negative 23577 pMy current understanding of the State design pattern is basically this p  pEncapsulate all of the behavior of an object in a particular state in an object. Delegate requests to the Current state object.p  pMy question is What is the best way to handle state transitions In my case, it is likely that Current state object will be the one who decides to what other state we need to transition to. Ive thought of 2 ways of implementing thisp  p1 The state objects methods can return some particular value that means Im requesting a state transition. The main object can then query the current state for what new state we should transition to, call ChangeState, and then route the original request to the new state.p  p2 The state object itself can call ChangeState on the parent, and then itself pass the request that caused the state change on to the new object.p  pScenario 2 has the advantage that the main object need only ever delegate requests to the Current state it internally will handle any necessary state transitions. It is also perhaps a little less obvious.p  pIm hoping there are known better ways of handling this scenario. What do you thinkp

Negative 23577 pI read about the a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comiphonelibrarydocumentationiPhoneConceptualiPhoneOSProgrammingGuideSupportingResolutionIndependenceSupportingResolutionIndependence.htmlapplerefdocuidTP40007072CH10 relnofollowpointpixelsa bit in the apple documentation, but still things are not completely clear to me. What I try to accomplish is placing a toolbar just above the keypad that appears when a textview is touched. The way it was working before IOS4 was by placing the toolbar at position code0,480code and then let it come up by subtracting codekeypad.size.ycode from its Y coordinate. In IOS4 this is still working fine as long as Im using the 3gs simulator but as soon as I switch to the giant iphone4 simulator the toolbar wont come up with the keypad because itll just move somewhere offscreen.p  pI understand there is now a scale factor involved when it comes to calculating screen coordinates and makes sense to replace the toobars start position 0,480 by using something likep  precodeCGRect phoneRect  [Util getPhoneScreenSize] CGSize phoneSize  phoneRect.size CGRect toolbarFrame  CGRectMake0, phoneSize.height, phoneSize.width, 44 codepre  pwhere getPhoneScreenSizep  precodeCGRect getPhoneScreenSize   UIScreen mainScreen  [UIScreen mainScreen]  CGRect bounds  [mainScreen bounds]  CGRect phoneRect  bounds   if[[UIScreen mainScreen] respondsToSelectorNSSelectorFromStringscale]     CGFloat scale  [mainScreen scale]    if  scale gt 0      phoneRect.origin.x  scale    phoneRect.origin.y  scale    phoneRect.size.width  scale    phoneRect.size.height  scale         return phoneRect  codepre  pBut still the confusing part is, although Im getting the correct resolution from codegetPhoneScreenSizecode for the HD screen, which is 640 x 960, using these coordinates to set my toolbar just offscreen 0,960 will in fact place it way offscreen and make it not come up again.  It seems the size of the HD screen is not mapping to the drawing coordinates I need to use to place something at an exact position on that same screen.  Is the simulator going weird on me Or am I missing something p

Negative 23577 pId really like to have my Python application deal exclusively with Unicode strings internally. This has been going well for me lately, but Ive run into an issue with handling paths. The POSIX API for filesystems isnt Unicode, so its possible and actually somewhat common for files to have undecodable names filenames that arent encoded in the filesystems stated encoding.p  pIn Python, this manifests as a mixture of codeunicodecode and codestrcode objects being returned from codeos.listdircode.p  precodegtgtgt os.listdirupathtofoo [ubar, bxe1z] codepre  pIn that example, the character codexe1code is encoded in Latin1 or somesuch, even when the hypothetical filesystem reports codesys.getfilesystemencoding  UTF8code in UTF8, that character would be the two bytes codexc3xa1code. For this reason, youll get codeUnicodeErrorcodes all over the place if you try to use, for example, codeos.path.joincode with Unicode paths, because the filename cant be decoded.p  pThe a hrefhttpdocs.python.orgpy3khowtounicode.htmlPython Unicode HOWTOa offers this advice about unicode pathnamesp  blockquote   pNote that in most occasions, the Unicode APIs should be used.

Negative 23577 pI have a list of tasks. A task is defined by a name, a due date and time and a duration.p  pMy TaskManager class handles a codestdlistltTaskgtcode sorted by due date. It has to provide a way to get the tasks due on a specific day.p  pAn example  I have task 1 due on Monday 6 am, task 2 due on Monday 9 am, task 3 due on Tuesday 7 pm. If I pass Monday to my method, it should return tasks 1 and 2.p  pHow would you implement that p  pI think a good way from API point of view would be to provide a codestdlistltTaskgtiteratorcode pair. So I would have a codeTaskManagerbegindatecode method. Do you think this method should get the iterator by iterating from the start of the list until it finds the first task due on that date, or by getting it from a codestdmapltdate, stdlistltTaskgtiteratorgtcode but then we have to keep it uptodate when adding or removing tasks p  pAnd then, how could I implement the codeTaskManagerenddatecode method p

Negative 23577 pIt seems that an codeNSEntityDescriptioncode object describes data and an codeNSManagedObjectcode object contains the corresponding data. If you have a normal codeNSObjectcode subclass, the description of the data and the actual data are in the same place, arent they. Well at least the description is in the class and the data is in the object. You can think of an object as having a description of the kind of variables it contains.p  pWhy then does Core Data separate the class which describes the data and the class which contains the data Is it to do with faultingp

Negative 23577 pQuestion related to how ORM Linq to SQL,EF 4 handles loading of data.  Is the entire data set loaded, if so can we prevent the entire data set from loading and load a subset  For example when instantiating the context and querying it seems like there would be a huge performance issue if all data was returned hundreds of thousand records versus instantiating a connection, executing a proc for given subset of data and querying for this subset of data.

Negative 23577 pUsing Linq2Entities EF4, I need to query an entity that has a Guid property call it id.

Negative 23577 pI am implementing a WCF service which will be used in part within a private LAN.p  pI will be using netTcpBinding and would like to implement some form of security on the communications, more specifically, it is important that the data be encrypted so that for example nobody could view the data being transferred across the network.p  pI dont believe Windows authentication will be appropriate as the end user may not maintain their windows logins and roles rigorously enough to use them as authentication.

Negative 23577 pIm writing a bunch of data to a socket, however, after what seems like around 64k is written the socket is closed with an error Connection reset by peer.  I believe what is happening is that what is reading the socket Android media player is dying when trying to read more data than is available from the socket.  This is a song that is being streamed and when the id3 tag is fairly large, it fails.  However, when I remove the id3 information from the song, it works fine.p  pSince I believe that the reading side is failing when there is not enough data, I am wondering if it is possible to write a bunch of data to the socket before calling socket.accept to accept the connection to read it.  My thinking here is that when the media player connects to the socket that there will be enough data for it to read and therefore not crash.  So can you call the write before acceptp  pHeres some psudocode of my current codep  precode    ServerSocket socket  new ServerSocketport, 0, InetAddress.getByAddressnew byte[] 127,0,0,1      socket.setSoTimeout10000     port  socket.getLocalPort      Socket client  socket.accept      ...      while isRunning ampamp readBytes  data.readbuff, 0, buff.length  1           client.getOutputStream.writebuff, 0, readBytes                  codepre

Negative 23577 pIt is often recommended to program to an interface, not an implementation.  It is useful to promote separation of concerns, and helps with unit testing.  However, I was thinking about API programming.p  pLets say I wrote an API and that API used a lot of programming to interfaces.  Lets also say that the API was insanely popular and used by many external clients.  If one of the interfaces in the API had to change, that would require apps using the API to be recompiled.p  pMy question is, how is such an issue avoided or the impact of such changes reduced, or is it unavoidable  I am not an API programer and would like to know the best practice here.  It seems to me that changing an interface that has existed for a long time and is widely used is a bad idea.p

Negative 23577 pIm currently writing a Python sandbox using sandboxed PyPy. Basically, the sandbox works by providing a controller that maps system library calls to a specified function instead. After following the instructions found at a hrefhttpcodespeak.netpypydistpypydocsandbox.html relnofollowcodespeaka which walk through the set up process, I realized that the default controller does not include a replacement for codeos.fstatcode, and therefore crashes when I call codeopencode. Specifically, the included codepypytranslatorsandboxsandlib.pycode does not contain a definition for codedollosllosfstatcode.p  pSo far, Ive implemented it asp  precodedef dollosllosfstatself, fd     return os.fstatfd codepre  pwhich seems to work fine.

Negative 23577 pThis is starting to drive me insane, as Ive followed every instruction I can find online and still cant get this to work all Im trying to do is have a view controller with a view that contains a tableview, and have the view controller handle the tableviews operations i.e. be the delegate and data source for it.p  pIve set up my view controller and its view, added a tableview to the view in IB, created and connected an IBOutlet from the view controller to the tableview, and set the tableviews data source and delegate to the view controller. Ive also made sure the view controller implements the UITableViewDelegate and UITableViewDataSource protocols in the interface file.p  pThe issue occurs when I then go to add my view controllers view to the window. I get an codeEXCBADACCESScode error on the codereturn UIApplicationMain...code linep  precodeimport ltUIKitUIKit.hgt  import ClareStreamsAppDelegate.h  int mainint argc, char argv[]      autoreleasepool          return UIApplicationMainargc, argv, nil, NSStringFromClass[ClareStreamsAppDelegate class]       codepre  pSo basically Im wondering what Im doing wrong here. As far as I can see Ive connected everything in Interface Builder, but is there some other initialization I need to do in the code And also another interesting point if I dont connect the data source and delegate outlets from the tableview in IB, the error does not occur and the view loads fine although obviously I then cant do anything with the tableview.p  pThanks for any helpp

Negative 23577 pIm trying to implement HTML5 Drag and Drop with a custom drag image, which appears behind the cursor. This can be done with codesetDragImagecode and works great with standalone images, i.e. created with codenew Imagecode.p  pHowever, to improve page loading speed, Id like to combine those images into one image, using sprites and the codebackgroundpositioncode trick.p  pTo implement sprites for use in codesetDragImagecode of the drag and drop functionality, the fact that elements can be used as a drag image comes in handy create a codeltdivgtcode, set its size and background image and position, and pass that codedivcode to codesetDragImagecode.p  pHowever, it appears that those images must be visible in the DOM. It looks like a screenshot of the element is made when you call codesetDragImagecode with a DOM element, and when the element is either hidden or not part of the DOM, the screenshot is empty, and as a result no image is shown when dragging.p  pPlease have a look at a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netAemN51 relnofollowthis fiddlea. Dragging the two text codedivcodes works fine with the drag image. However, after clicking the button to hide the image codedivcodes, dragging the text codedivcodes does not make the drag image show up anymore.p  pI only need to have this working on Google Chrome.p  pHow can I use sprite images with HTML5 Drag and Drop codesetDragImagecode while the codedivcodes containing the sprites as background images are hidden or not in the DOM Or, is there another technique of using sprites with codesetDragImagecodep

Negative 23577 pI am developing an application that is using bluetooth to automatically connect to nearby paired devices. For that reason I need to listen to bluetooth specific broadcasts like ACTIONFOUND, DISCOVERYFINISHED etc. , I have to register a broadcast receiver which listens for those broadcasts and performs actions accordingly. Thing is that I need this broadcast receiver to work at any time in the background of my app. I tried to fit it into an intentservice but it turned out that it finishes to fast and onDestroy is called ending my receiver. To overcome this problem I inserted an infinite loop which breaks only when an attribute is turned from true to false. Somehow I feel this is a bad practice and so I am asking you if there is any better solutionp  pPS. Should I fit the receiver in the main activity And when does it gets destroyed Is onDestroy called only when I exit my application with back button, or kill the process with a task killer, or does it occur also when I enter another GUI window in my appp  pThanks, Mikep

Negative 23577 pI always had major performance problems when setting .ItemsSource on a Datagrid to a collection. The method returns fast, but there is a very noticable delay before anything is actually rendered to the screen. Since the Datagrid has the Virtualization modes set, it should be able to handle very larges collections easily. I printed out some debug information in the binded properties of the item collection, to make sure its not loading the whole collection, but it only accessed the first few items, so Im sure virtualization is working. And even for small collections, the delay is about the same, so it seems unrelated to actual data loading.p  pSo its purely the rendering that is causing the slowdown. Most of the times this is caused by having the Datagrid inside a ScrollViewer, or having auto rowheight generation, etc. But I ruled all these possible causes out, by giving everything fixed widths, and make sure nothing is set to Infinite or Auto.p  pAfter pulling my hair out for weeks, I tried something simple I switched the Datagrid for a GridView. And to my amazement it does not suffer from the large delay, it paints instantly. Both have exactly the same properties and styling, so Im trying to understand why the Datagrid was so much slower.p  pIs there any logical reason why a DataGrid could be slower than a GridViewp

Negative 23577 pA few days ago I has asked a question on SO about helping me design a paradigm for structuring multiple HTTP requestsp  pHeres the scenario. I would like a have a multiprodcuer, multiconsumer system. My producers crawl and scrape a few sites and add the links that it finds into a queue. Since Ill be crawling multiple sites, I would like to have multiple producerscrawlers.p  pThe consumersworkers feed off this queue, make TCPUDP requests to these links and saves the results to my Django DB. I would also like to to have multipleworkers as as each queue item is totally independent of each other.p  pPeople suggested that use a coroutine library for this i.e. Gevent or Eventlet. Having never worked with coroutines, I read that even though the programming paradigm is similar to threaded paradigms, only one thread is actively executing but when blocking calls occur  such as IO calls  the stacks are switched inmemory and the other green thread takes over until it encounters some sort of a blocking IO call. Hopefully I got this right Heres the code from one of my SO postsp  precodeimport gevent from gevent.queue import  import time import random  q  JoinableQueue workers  [] producers  []  def doworkwid, value     gevent.sleeprandom.randint0,2     print Task, value, done, wid  def workerwid     while True         item  q.get         try             print Got item s  item             doworkwid, item         finally             print No more items             q.taskdone   def producer     while True         item  random.randint1, 11         if item  10             print Signal Received             return         else             print Added item s  item             q.putitem    for i in range4     workers.appendgevent.spawnworker, random.randint1, 100000  This doesnt work. for j in range2     producers.appendgevent.spawnproducer  Uncommenting this makes this script work. producer  q.join codepre  pThis works well because the codesleepcode calls are blocking calls and when a codesleepcode event occurs, another green thread takes over. This is a lot faster than sequential execution. As you can see, I dont have any code in my program that purposely yields the execution of one thread to another thread. I fail to see how this fits into scenario above as I would like to have all the threads executing simultaneously.p  pAll works fine, but I feel the throughput that Ive achieved using GeventEventlets is higher than the original sequentially running program but drastically lower than what could be achieved using realthreading. p  pIf I were to reimplement my program using threading mechanisms, each of my producers and consumers could simultaneously be working without the need to swap stacks in and out like coroutines.p  pShould this be reimplemented using threading Is my design wrong Ive failed to see the real benefits of using coroutines.p  pMaybe my concepts are little muddy but this is what Ive assimilated. Any help or clarification of my paradigm and concepts would be great.p  pThanksp

I mean  it cant work like that, I cant update the game logic only when the device app wants to redraw the surface or am I wrong.p  pAfter some googling I came to a conclusion that I have to create another thread for update loop. But then I had another problem  with one thread taking care of drawing and another one taking care of updating the game logic I didnt know how to make them cooperate. First, they were two separate classes at least in my implementation so they couldnt use the same game variables and objects sprites, timers, different variables, counters and so on... pretty much everything these two classes needed to do their jobs. Now I think I could somehow pack them both into one class. But  second, I needed to synchronize the two threads somehow.p  pFinally, I came out with this general ideap  ul li3 classes ol licodepublic class MyRenderer implements GLSurfaceView.Renderercode with codeonSurfaceCreatedcode method taking care of drawingli licodepublic class UpdateThread implements Runnablecode with coderuncode and codeupdatecode methods. coderuncode was calling codeupdatecode method exactly 60 times a second I wanted a fixed step loopli licodepublic class SpritesHoldercode used as a container for all the game objectsvariablesstuff like sprites, timers, state variables and so on... with all the fields public.li olli liSo basically the codeSpritesHoldercode class was a box holding all the needed variables in one place, so codeMyRenderercode and codeUpdateThreadcode classes could access it and use it.li lipAs for synchronization  I just did smth like thisp  precodepublic void updatefloat delta      synchronized spritesHolder               whole method code...       codepre  pandp  precodepublic void onDrawFrameGL10 gl      synchronized spritesHolder               whole method code...       codepre  pso that both threads didnt use the spritesHolder at the same time. So updates were done 60 times per second and drawing took place whenever app device needed.pli ul  pA lot of talking, sorry, Ive almost finished writing this post.  So anyway  this described above works and I even did write some game based on this template but I think my ideas might be crazy and one can desing it all a whole lot better. Id be very grateful for all comments and advices.p
Negative 23577 pIn XCode 4.2 when I create a new branch and open it, the iOS scheme which exists in the Master is lost. Instead I have a scheme for Mac 64 bit. p  pThis has happened a few times in a row and I handle it by creating a new scheme, deleting the Mac 64 bit one and then renaming the new scheme to what the original was. Id rather fix whatever is wrong though. Did I set something up wrong  some preference somewherep

Negative 23577 pIm trying to send post data between pages with Post. Not a form  like I may be passing validation error between pages or something using it in several places.p  pThe cURL is executing fine, but its just tacking on the new page at the bottom. How can I execute a cURL Post and load the following pagep  pSo my goal is to send data between pages. I do not want to use GET or cookies as I do not want to rely on the user, and Id prefer not to use SESSION as it is not so much directly about a session as sending private data between pages.p  pThanksp  precodech  curlinitsomeurl curlsetoptch, CURLOPTPOST, true curlsetoptch, CURLOPTPOSTFIELDS, myvarsomething curlexecch curlclosech codepre  pI doubt the code has any relevance, as its about performing a task not code syntax there may be one in this example but youll have to trust me its not the code thats buggy as its retrieving fine.p

The code is compiled without any error. But unfortunately, it doesnt work. The LEDs should show the states of the switches, but they are always turned off.p  pHowever, when I tried hardcode the LEDs states like codeLEDs[70]  8b11111111code inside the codeinitialcode block, the LEDs stays turned on all the time. While when I placed codeLEDs[70]  8b11111111code inside the codealwayscode block, the LEDs stays turned off all the time. It seems that the FPGA does not execute the code inside codealwayscode block, what is wrong Am I implementing the design in a wrong wayp
Negative 23577 pWe are working on a chatting based website. After doing an extensive literature review we shorted to use Tornado as our web server, socket.io as client side javascript.p  pWe are now in a process to scale up our application to serve approximately 50,000 users at a time. So, I would like to ask if Ejabberd can fit in our architecture agreeing to the fact that we are open to changes, which change our current implementation drastically, provided it is worth it or is there any other technology stack for scaling up the same.p  pOur focus is one one to one user chatting.p

Negative 23577 pI am using pythonbottle to return a dictjson to my android app  the app using GSON to parse into JSON.  It doesnt seem to parse the python text correctly.p  pHere is what python returnsp  precode[uslot 1.0, urnd 1.0] codepre  pBut Gson sets slot  0 and round 0, so it is either not reading it properly or just setting it to default values.  How can I get python to not return the unicode encoded string and just a regular or string.  Here is the offending python codep  precode... return strmove codepre  pMove is the object the is returned for a pymongo find query and at the time of test it was [uslot 1.0, urnd 1.0], well python added the u, when we look at the values in rockmongo it doesnt have the u.p

So as you understood 3rd remote object call will take the 2nds response as its parameter, and the 2nd one will take 1sts response as parameter.p  pMy problem is that when I iterate through the response of first request it calls the 2nd remote object only for its last element not for each.p  pHeres my view codep  precodeltfxDeclarationsgt     ltparsleyFastInject propertykarBUS typeKarBUSgt         ltsCallResponder idhastalariGetirResponder resulthastalariGetirResponderresultHandlereventgt         ltsCallResponder idyatakOdaGetirResponder resultyatakOdaGetirResponderresultHandlerevent faultyatakOdaGetirResponderfaultHandlereventgt         ltsCallResponder idhastaKartlariGetirResponder resulthastaKartlariGetirResponderresultHandlereventgt         ltsCallResponder idhastaResimGetirResponder resulthastaResimGetirResponderresultHandlereventgt         ltparsleyConfigure  gt     ltfxDeclarationsgt  ltfxScriptgt         lt[CDATA[  [InjectidkarBUS] public var karBUSKarBUS              protected function view1creationCompleteHandlereventFlexEventvoid                                traceHastalarim View persIDSessionClientData.prsnl.personelId,servisID   SessionClientData.servisId                 hastalariGetirResponder.token  karBUS.getHastalarimSessionClientData.prsnl.personelId,SessionClientData.servisId                protected function hastalariGetirResponderresultHandlereventResultEventvoid                              hastalarim  hastalariGetirResponder.lastResult                  ifhastalarim.length  0                      this.addElementtxtempty                     this.removeElementbusyind                                   forvar iint0ilthastalarim.lengthi                      kt  hastalarim.getItemAti as Object                      vizitID  kt[6]                     hastaTC  kt[3]                      yatakOdaGetirResponder.token  karBUS.getYatakOdaNovizitID                                  protected function yatakOdaGetirResponderresultHandlereventResultEventvoid                              yatakOda  yatakOdaGetirResponder.lastResult as Object                  hastaKartlariGetirResponder.token  karBUS.getHastaKartivizitID                            protected function hastaKartlariGetirResponderresultHandlereventResultEventvoid                              hastaTuru  hastaKartlariGetirResponder.lastResult as String                  hastaResimGetirResponder.token  karBUS.getHastaResimhastaTC                           protected function hastaResimGetirResponderresultHandlereventResultEventvoid                              resim  hastaResimGetirResponder.lastResult as ByteArray                   dpnew ArrayCollection                  var yatakString                 var odaString                 var katString                  ifyatakOda  null                     yatak                       oda                       kat                   else                     yatak  yatakOda[2]                     oda  yatakOda[1]                     kat  yatakOda[0]                                   forvar iint0ilthastalarim.lengthi                      kt  hastalarim.getItemAti as Object                      var dtDate  kt[5] as Date                     var vizitTString  dt.date    dt.month1    dt.fullYear                      dp.addItemhastaIdkt[0], adikt[1],soyadikt[2],tcKimlikNokt[3], resim resim,                         yasikt[4],katNokat,odaNooda,yatakNoyatak,                         vizitTarihivizitT,vizitIdkt[6],cinsiyetikt[7], hastaTuruhastaTuru                       traceOdaNO  Yatak NO  oda  ,   yatak                                             ]]gt     ltfxScriptgt codepre  pHow can I make flex threads wait until the previous one returns a response any thread handling methodp

Negative 23577 pI have a website at the moment with a redirect which points www.example.com to subscribe.example.com which shows a LaunchRock subscription splash screen.

Negative 23577 pI am working on a program which analyzes PowerPC code and generates LLVM code for it. As my analysis of branch pointssubroutine adresses the code may be incomplete for example, if the code does something very weird with function pointers I plan to have a fallback mechanism set up like sop  ol liGenerated subroutine attempts to branch to address from original program, which will be an unmappedunexecutable page depending on host architecture capabilities.li liA segmentation fault results.li liSegmentation fault handler identifies what happens, saves the address for full analysis the next time the program is started, then performs a quick and dirty analysis and uses LLVMs JIT capacity to generate executable code for the new branch target.li liProcessor state at the time of the branch is restored, except directed towards the newly generated code.li ol  pThe problem is I cannot figure out how to obtain the processor state at the segmentation fault.

Negative 23577 pIn the model of my application I have a list of parents each referecing a list of children e.g. a list of footballteams each containing a list of players.p  pI visualize this list in a tree view.  I created a viewmodelclass for the tree and a viewmodelclass for a footballteam lets call it footballteamViewModel.  The class for the tree holds an ObservableCollection with footballteamViewModelitems.  The itemssource for the tree is this ObservableCollection.  During initialization, I create for every footballteam in the model a corresponding footballteamViewModel object and add it to the ObservableCollection.p  pThe thing is, that the list of footballteams in my model can be changed from outside of the tree and I want the tree to be updated.  So if someone removes a footballteam from my list in the model, I would have to remove the corresponding item in my ObservableCollection of footballteamViewModelitems.p  pI cannot bind the list of footballteams from the model directly to the view.  So I have to update my ObservableCollection in the ViewModel somehow, every time the collection in the model is changed.p  pMy way to handle this is to use an ObservableCollection in the model and register to the collectionChangedevent in the ViewModel, so that I update my ViewModel the Observable Collection of footballteamViewModel objects whenever the modelcollection is changed.  But this does not feel right. Is there a better wayp  pWhile typing this I found another post which describes exactly the same problem a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2906940wpfmvvmdelegatingadomainmodelcollectiontoaviewmodelWPFMVVM Delegating a domain Model collection to a ViewModela.

They were all helpful, so its worth reading them all.

Negative 23577 pIm looking for a good description of what happens if one commits during rebase and how this could be reverted in an easy way.p  pLets consider a scenario, where a large commit is rebased. During rebase a conflict appears and user begins merging changes. Now, imagine a scenario where you were almost done, but you didnt call emgit rebase continueem  for whatever reason be it long weekend or such. The next week you just resumed working, stil during rebase. Finally, you call emgit commit amendem to append the changes to the last commit and... they end up in the commit you were rebasing into.p  pNaturally, you can always checkout the commit you started rebasing from and hack your way thruogh  say, for example, by trying to copy all the files from your amend, but that may drop the changes that were introduced in the meantime.p  pIs there a clean, good way to fix this This is one particular state I should be careful about and I never want to end up in it, but it still happens occasionally  and I end up spending one whole day trying to get things straight.p  pI would really appreciate all help and suggestions.

Negative 23577 pI am a novice while working on d3.js.p  pI wanted to know how can we Animate some data eg. Change colors with respect to time.p  peg. Lets say, in Monitoring app, I am projecting cluster data over US Map. Projection is done by drawing a circle and filling it by RED, GREEN or YELLOW color depending on its status.p  pWhen we start monitoring, ideally all circles will be filled with GREEN color and then over time color can change to YELLOW or RED depending on how cluster is behaving.p  pSo if I need to play these color changes over time in some time window, how can it be done p  pIf you can point me to any of the similar examples , that will help too p  pThanksp

Negative 23577 pI have seen developers using Springs Autowired feature making Spring framework responsible for instantiating and injecting SUT System Under Test or CUT Class Under Test in the test class or fixture. The following is the snippet showing Autowired being used in the test fixturep  precodeimport org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired import org.springframework.test.annotation.ExpectedException import org.springframework.test.context.testng.AbstractTestNGSpringContextTests import org.springframework.test.context.ContextConfiguration    interface BackingStore      Some methods    class Logger      public LoggerBackingStore backingStore              Capture input parameter into member variables           public void LogString message               Some logic        ContextConfigurationlocations   classpathsomeconfig.xml  public class LoggerTests extends AbstractTestNGSpringContextTests      Autowired     private Logger logger      Test     ExpectedExceptionNullPointerException     public void LogWhenPassedNullShouldThrowException              logger.Lognull       codepre  pAll the dependencies recursively required by the SUT are specified as part of the Spring configuration XML file. I do not like this approach. I like all the test unit or integration to read like a story I heard Kent Beck saying the same thing . I like instantiating SUTCUT in the test case itself even though if it is complex. This gives a clear picture about the test case.p  pI have few concerns regarding Autowired or any auto injection mechanism being used for injecting SUT in the test fixturep  ol lipIt reduces test code readability. Autowire appears like magic. Arrange of AAA ArrangeActAssert moves to XML file from test code.pli lipIt reduces test code maintainability. This is because of 2.pli lipCould not effectively verify constructor of SUTCUT throwing exception in exceptional cases. I am not 100 sure about this. I do not know if Spring framework has an answer for this.pli lipIt seems overkill for unit or integration tests.pli ol  pI ask experts for 2 cents on this subject.p  pThanks.p

Thank you very muchp  h1EDITh1  pI would like to thank for the answers about CREATE a table to store all types to JOIN it. It really solves the problem. My approach solves it too, but does it storing the types, as you did.p  pSo, I have another question, based on the received answers... is it possible to reach the expected result with some MySQL command that will not CREATE a new table andor INSERT these typesp  pI dont see any problem, actually, in solve my question storing the types... I just would like to find a simplified command... something like a best practice... some kind of filter... as I could run p  precodeGROUP BY data.type0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 codepre  pand it could return these filtered values. p  pI am really interested to learn such a command, if it really existsis possible.p  pAnd again, thank you very muchp  h1EDIT 2h1  pOkay... I think I found it Thank you allp  pI agree with the GordonLinoff comment that the best practice refers to store the btypesb values and describe them, so you can keep the database concise and make clearer to other developers and for you too what exactly these things means.p  pBut, as far as I learned and I agree it, if you have a little set of info and mainly if you will not really need this info it is preferable to treat it in some other way than storing it.p  pSo, working in my question yesterday and today I developed this queryp  precodeSELECT    SUMIFdata.type  0, 1, 0 AS 0,    SUMIFdata.type  1, 1, 0 AS 1,    SUMIFdata.type  2, 1, 0 AS 2,    SUMIFdata.type  3, 1, 0 AS 3,    SUMIFdata.type  4, 1, 0 AS 4,    SUMIFdata.type  5, 1, 0 AS 5,    SUMIFdata.type  6, 1, 0 AS 6,    SUMIFdata.type  7, 1, 0 AS 7,    SUMIFdata.type  8, 1, 0 AS 8,    SUMIFdata.type  9, 1, 0 AS 9  FROM data codepre  pNot a so faster, optimized and beauty query, but to the size of data Ill manage less than 100.000 rows each importation it manually does the GROUPCOUNT job, running in 0.13 sec. p  pIt differs from the result I was expecting just for the content positioning instead of 10 rows and two columns as the result, I got just one row and 10 columns, labeled with the matching type.p  pProbably Ill change the labels to some kind of identifier like type 0 means header as the result order itself will match each total with its numeric value.p  pIf you knowfind any improvements or if it doesnt seems a good approach, Ill be glad to know what you guys think.p  pThank you so muchp

Given the application Im working on, I do not have the freedom change the CSS style of the containing codeDIVcode.p
Negative 23577 pI would like to sort such type of wider matrices that contain same types per column but each column may have different types. This sort should perform so that all columns of a line stay together but lines order following the value of a defined columnp  precode[  [1, 0, 0.25,ind1, pop2, 0.56], [2, 0, 0.35,ind2, pop2, 0.58], [1, 0, 0.23,ind1, pop1, 0.66], ... ] codepre  pHere I perform a sort algo by column 2 floating point columnp  precode[  [1, 0, 0.23,ind1, pop1, 0.66], [1, 0, 0.25,ind1, pop2, 0.56], [2, 0, 0.35,ind2, pop2, 0.58], ... ] codepre  pDid it change if column contains char types thanks for help and advices, yet checked lexsort, sort, argsort...but probably in a wrong way. Edit I dont know why but if my matrix is defined as numpy.matrix, argsort method adds a dimension so three dimension result, that doesnt happen if the matrix was defined using numpy.array.

Negative 23577 pMy company has an iOS app that interfaces directly with Salesforce, with one major drawback. When a user attempts to upload an illegal character, the app hangs, returns bad values, or results in some other erratic behavior.p  pI found a really handy piece of code out in the mystical interwebs thanks, MailDrop, that filters a string and escapes those illegal characters with a forward slash. It then returns the value in a string, ready for upsertingquerying.p  pOne thing Im really having trouble with is getting this to work with our application, though. Our data is stored in a dictionary and is written to in a variety of ways querying the server, or manual input, and at various times in the applications life cycle. Im not quite sure how to invoke this nifty escapeSosl in the most efficient method. Is there a way that I can escape these characters every time I write to Core Data What Im most afraid of is going through the app and calling this hundreds of times.p  pHere is the escaping methodp  precode NSString escapeSoslNSString src           from docs, these are all reserved         NSArray reserved  [NSArray arrayWithObjects, amp, , , , , [, ], , , , ,  ,, , , nil]         NSMutableString s  [NSMutableString stringWithStringsrc]         NSString r         NSEnumerator e  [reserved objectEnumerator]         while r  [e nextObject]             [s replaceOccurrencesOfStringr withString[NSString stringWithFormat, r] optionsNSLiteralSearch rangeNSMakeRange0, [s length]]         return s      codepre  pWhat I find complicated is the timing of these escapings, and how to apply that to each situation.

Id like to escape the data in a way that I do not need to worry about the timing of these manipulations.p  precodeNSMutableDictionary contactDict  [NSMutableDictionary new]  if myAccount.contact.email      [contactDict setObjectmyAccount.contact.email forKeyEmail]  else      [contactDict setObject forKeyEmail]   if myAccount.contact.name      Split name in two     NSArray nameArray  [myAccount.contact.name componentsSeparatedByString ]      NSString firstName  [nameArray objectAtIndex0]     NSString lastName  [nameArray lastObject]       [contactDict setObjectfirstName forKeyfirstName]     [contactDict setObjectlastName forKeylastName]  else      [contactDict setObject forKeyfirstName]     [contactDict setObject forKeylastName]   if myAccount.contact.phone     [contactDict setObjectmyAccount.contact.phone forKeyPhone]  else      [contactDict setObject forKeyPhone]   updateContactRequest  [[SFRestAPI sharedInstance] requestForUpdateWithObjectTypeContact objectIdmyAccount.createdContactID fieldscontactDict] [[SFRestAPI sharedInstance] sendupdateContactRequest delegateself] codepre  pSo this may seem like a bit of a large question, but does anyone have some pointers as to how I could escape characters in these various dictionaries, using something similar to the escapeSosl code I included above, whenever things are written to core datap

If the checksum does not match with what I want.

Negative 23577 pIm using Xcode 4.6.1 and I have an iOS 6.1 app.p  pIt has a table view that drills down into another table view. The second table view uses custom cells to display its data. However, there is a problem with the second table view its content size is usually wrong specifically the height, which is either too tall or too short. This either results in there being extra space at the bottom, or there not being enough space to be able to scroll to the bottom. p  pThe picture below shows four screenshots from a test app that I made which reproduces the problem. Im going to give a walkthrough of the steps leading to my problem.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comWqq5p.png altFour images from my test appp  ol lipThe app loads, and the first table is shown. It has three rows that drill down into the second table.pli lipI select the first row, which is List 0 to 10. The navigation controller pushes the second table onto the screen. It has has 11 rows, and correctly has the content size for 11 rows.pli lipThen I went back and selected the next row, which is List A to P. The second table comes onto the screen again, and it has 16 rows now. However, it only has the content size for 11 rows. The other 5 rows are still down below, but the content size keeps bouncing me back up to the 11th row.pli lipThen I went back and selected the last row, which is List a to f. The second table comes onto the screen again, and it has 6 rows. However, it still has the content size for 11 rows. There is too much space at the bottom of the table view, and it shows 5 cells at the bottom with nothing in them.pli ol  pThe pattern here is that the content size stays at whatever it was when it initially loaded. So the first row I select will have the correct content size, but all the other ones will now stay at that size, regardless of how many rows they have. This also means if I had selected List a to f first, which has 6 rows, then all the other ones would have a content size for 6 rows, because it stays at whatever the content size was for the emfirst rowem I selected.p  pIn my code, I am never changing the content size myself this is all happening automatically. To figure out when and why the table view was changing its content size, I set an observer on the second tables contentSize property. After I did this, I realized that the content size wasnt staying the same, but that it was actually being changed emtwiceem when I selected a row first to the correct size when the table view reloaded, and then reverted back to the old size when the table view appeared.p  pSo Im trying to figure out why its being reverted back to the old size. To see what was going on behind the scenes, I had it print out a stack trace every time it observed the content size changing.p  pBelow, you can see the console log for the previous steps that a walked you through. However, to conserve space and make it more readable, I replaced the long stack traces with a message like, Stack Trace Type A. Ill show you the details of them later, but for now Im just calling them Stack Trace Type A, B, or C.p  precodefirst table selected row 0 List 0 to 10 second table viewDidLoad OBSERVED CHANGE contentSize.height  484 row count  11 Stack Trace Type A OBSERVED CHANGE contentSize.height  484 row count  11 Stack Trace Type B second table viewWillAppear OBSERVED CHANGE contentSize.height  484 row count  11 Stack Trace Type C second table viewDidAppear going back to first table second table viewWillDisappear second table viewDidDisappear  first table selected row 1 List A to P OBSERVED CHANGE contentSize.height  704 row count  16 Stack Trace Type A second table viewWillAppear OBSERVED CHANGE contentSize.height  484 row count  16 Stack Trace Type C second table viewDidAppear going back to first table second table viewWillDisappear second table viewDidDisappear  first table selected row 2 List a to f OBSERVED CHANGE contentSize.height  264 row count  6 Stack Trace Type A second table viewWillAppear OBSERVED CHANGE contentSize.height  484 row count  6 Stack Trace Type C second table viewDidAppear going back to first table second table viewWillDisappear second table viewDidDisappear codepre  pAs you can see, its reverting the content size back to the old size. In this case, that would be 484, which is enough space to show 11 cells with a height of 44. If things were working correctly, the observed change thats coupled with emStack Trace Type Cem would not be happening. So in other words, Type C is whats causing the problem.p  pNow Ill show you what the stack traces actually look like. Note that the first two A and B arent related to the problem.

Also, on several of the lines in Type C, there are actually methods being called behind the scenes with the words OldSize in their names. So apparently it emreally isem reverting it back the old size. However, I still dont understand why these QuartzCore and OldSize methods are being called in the first place.p  pI tried looking up resizeSubviewsWithOldSize, but the only a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibrarymacdocumentationCocoaReferenceApplicationKitClassesNSViewClassReferenceNSView.htmlapplerefdocuid20000014CJADCGFJ relnofollowdocumentationa I could find on it was for emNSViewem which is for OS X apps, not iOS apps which use UIView. This description in the docs didnt really help me understand emwhyem it was being called in this case.p  pHowever, even though I dont know why its being called, I have a pretty good idea of emwhenem its being called. With more testing I realized that it reverts to the old content size whenever the table view appears, and sometimes when it disappears.p  pFor example, when I made a modal view cover the screen and then go away, the content size was actually changed 3 times. The log messages looked something like this.p  precodeModal view entering second table viewWillDisappear OBSERVED CHANGE contentSize.height  484 row count  11 Stack Trace Type C second table viewDidDisappear  Modal view exiting second table viewWillAppear OBSERVED CHANGE contentSize.height  484 row count  11 Stack Trace Type C second table viewDidAppear OBSERVED CHANGE contentSize.height  484 row count  11 Stack Trace Type C codepre  pSo the change isnt related to the table view being reloaded it has to do with it appearing and disappearing. Im guessing that views try to layout their subviews every time they appear, so there seems to be a problem with how my custom cells are laid out.p  pInitially I thought that the problem was with how my custom cells were set up either in my code or in the xib. This was because the problem disappeared when I didnt use my custom cells. But then one time I turned auto layout off in my custom cell xib, and the problem also disappeared. So apparently the problem has something to do with auto layout.p  pFor the sake of easy debugging, the way I set up the cell in the xib is very simple the only thing on the cell is a UILabel with a gray background color. All of the auto layout constraints were the default ones made by Interface Builder. You can see what my custom cell xib looks like below.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comJT267.png altMasterCell xibp  pI also tried deleting the UILabel so the cell had nothing on it, and I left auto layout turned on. When I did this, the problem also went away. So I guess theres something wrong with the way the UILabel is set up on the cell. Which is odd since it was set up with those purple default constraints by Interface Builder that I cant delete.p  pAfter looking around for information regarding auto layout in table view cells, I came across a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12600214contentviewnotindentinginios6uitableviewcellprototypecellthis questiona. Apparently, Interface Builder doesnt set its constraints to the cells content view correctly. I wasnt sure if this was related to my problem, but I tried it anyways. I used the solution posted by Adrian, which looked like this.p  precode  MasterCell.m   My custom UITableViewCell subclass   voidawakeFromNib      [super awakeFromNib]      for NSLayoutConstraint cellConstraint in self.constraints           [self removeConstraintcellConstraint]          id firstItem  cellConstraint.firstItem  self  self.contentView  cellConstraint.firstItem         id seccondItem  cellConstraint.secondItem  self  self.contentView  cellConstraint.secondItem          NSLayoutConstraint contentViewConstraint          [NSLayoutConstraint constraintWithItemfirstItem                                      attributecellConstraint.firstAttribute                                      relatedBycellConstraint.relation                                         toItemseccondItem                                      attributecellConstraint.secondAttribute                                     multipliercellConstraint.multiplier                                       constantcellConstraint.constant]          [self.contentView addConstraintcontentViewConstraint]       codepre  pHowever, while it seemed to do what it was intended to do i.e. change the constraints to be related to the content view instead of the cell itself, this still didnt solve my problem the content size was still being reverted back to the old size.p  pemSo in conclusionem, and to clarify this rather long question, this is basically what Im asking.p  pWhy is it that, when I enable auto layout in my custom table cell xib, that the table views content size gets incorrectly resized back to the old size when the table appears on the screenp

Negative 23577 pI am building a mobile app using Titanium Studio, build 3.1.1.201303242433, CLI version 3.0.24, Titanium SDK version 3.0.2.GA, iOS SDK 6.1, iPad Simulator 6.1 on MAC OS X10.7.5. I am attempting to retrieve JSON data from a remote database. The database has records with and without a sectionid sectionids are numbers 112. I want to retrieve the records with the sectionid I pass to my query. Here are the steps I am following First I assign a sectionid to a tableViewRow like thisp  precodeleftImageimagesadvertising.png,              titleAdvertising,             sectionid 1,              color000,             font fontWeightbold, fontSize16,             height44dp,              hasChildtrue,              testtestcatmenu.js, codepre  pThen I pass the sectionid to another file like thisp  precodevar section  e.rowData.sectionid win.section  section codepre  pIn the next file I get the sectionid and pass it to the remote php file like thisp  precodevar section  Ti.UI.currentWindow.section var url  httpmydomain.commyfile.phpsectionidsection codepre  pFinally, in the php file I GET the sectionid and use it in my MySQL query like thisp  precoderesult  mysqlquerySELECT name FROM cmsclient WHERE sectionid   .     mysqlrealescapestringGET[section] . or dieCould not query codepre  pThe php file is returning the records that do not have a sectionid, so somewhere I am losing the sectionid I do not know where my code syntax is wrong, would someone be so kind to show me the correct syntax that I need to make this workp

Negative 23577 pI have a differing number of coefficients between two equations that I would need to compare.  I.Ep  precode    Y  coef3X3  coef2X2  coef1X  coef0 codepre  pThese coefficients can be anywhere from 0 inf. p  pI would need to compare each equation to the one before it, and return the percent difference between these two equations. I have values for X, Y, and the coefficients for each of the equations that I would need to find the percent difference for. p  pI could take the standard percent difference between two known Y values and calculate the percent difference, but since these are polynomials, the percent difference would always be changing. p  pI could also take a circle with a set radius and find the angle of each equations intersection with that circle with respect to the Xaxis, in order to find a degree which could be correlated to a percentage with 90degrees being equivalent to 100 change between the equations. Yet I wouldnt be sure that this would be accurate, since anything outside of the circle would have a potentially different percent difference. p  pThis will be written in Perl. p
Negative 23577 pIve inherited an application which uses the viewfirst MVVMC patern p  pIn the application Ive created 2 step process which creates a person and assigns them to a group. To do this Ive created a view and corresponding view model all views have a 121 relationship with a view model, view models are injected into the View constructor and are registered with the Unity container using the TransientLifetimeManager called CreatePersonMaster, the view simply contains a region shown by the dashed line which subviews can be loaded into and the view model subscribes to two loosely coupled events, PersonCreated and GroupSelected. The PersonCreated event saves a Person entity in a field and the GroupSelected event takes the saved Person, creates a Group association and saves them to a database. p  pThis viewview model doesnt do anything until the events get raised so I load the following sub views into my the region. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comkBrt8.png altCreate Person Viewsp  pThese viewsview models fire the events which get handled by the master view. p  pI also have an edit view where I want to reuse the select group view. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comxFiMO.png altEdit Person Viewsp  pI can do this by subscribing to the appropriate events in the EditPersonMaster view model. p  pMy question really is, is this the appropriate way to do this Because Im using loosely coupled events I dont get any feedback into the subViewViewModels if theres an error when creatingreassigning I could probably fire another ErrorBlah event for the inner viewmodel to handle and update the view.p  pIs there another way to do this Composite commands dont seem to fit the bill but maybe I dont understand them correctly.p

Negative 23577 pI have had a few files show up on my tomcat server lately that are obviously hacker attempts. I support an older application that uses struts and ibatis along with various other frameworks. Three files were created, a system1.jsp under the actual webapp directory, so like codetomcatwebappsROOTsystem1.jspcode, and then two other files that were created under codetomcatwebappssystem2.jspcode and codetomcatwebappssystem3.jspcode. p  pThe content of these files strange, it looks like its trying to create a user account, which would seem like a long shot. The way struts was set up there is no way they would actually reach those jsp files anyways, what makes me worry is the fact that they were able to create these files at all. How can I prevent this from happening p  pHere is the apache log from the hack, as well as the rest of the code,p  precode198.211.11.202   [28Apr2013020534 0500] GET requeststart.do

Negative 23577 pI have a problem that I cant explain.p  pI have a viewController with a view. This view contains a UIbutton and a toolbar. Because the toolBar is a parameters bar, I dont want it to be present on my view all the time. So Ive decided to use a button to show it.p  pIm using the interface builder to design my view. The button will be in the top left corner, and the toolbar just above the view. origin  0  , 44p  pIve linked my button to a IBAction function showing my toolbar p  precode IBActionshowOptionsidsender      if[parametersBar isHidden]              [parametersBar setHiddenNO]         [UIView animateWithDuration0.2                          animations                              [parametersBar setTransformCGAffineTransformMakeTranslation0, 44]                                     ]       codepre  pparametersBar is set to be hidden in the viewDidLoadp  pThis works fine.p  pBut here we are  my button is now hidden by the toolbar So what about translate it toop  pImpossible to make both of my elements translate of 44px I thought I was doing something wrong. But even by just making the button move move, the result of the translation is not the expected one.p  precode IBActionshowOptionsidsender          if[parametersBar isHidden]                      [parametersBar setHiddenNO]             [UIView animateWithDuration0.2                              animations                                  [parametersButton setTransformCGAffineTransformMakeTranslation0, 44]                                             ]               codepre  pIve put some NSLogs before and after the animation  they write the expected positions of my button but on my device screen, it is not at the right place. And performing a translation at the two elements results that the toolbar doesnt go at the right place.p  pIm using Autolayout in my .xib . Could it be the reason of these issues Does performing a transformation on the button which asks for this transformation has an influencep  pBy the way, running the same code on a 3GS hasnt the same effect  the button jump, and makes the translation expected from where it is 44px above to its original positionp  pWell, this problem is difficult to explain, but I hope to be clear. If you need more precisions to understand, dont hesitate to ask me for more details.p

Negative 23577 pSo Im thinking Im either missing something very obvious and setting myself up for a nasty fall or this is so obviously ok that no one really talks about it.p  pI want to use one style sheet for a small website, but I want a slightly different layout on some of the pages.p  pExample Home Page would have right sidebar another page would be full width and another would possibly have three columns.p  pSo thats it. What Im creating is multiple codedivcode with different dimensions that would fit the various formats. p  pIe. coderightSidecode codeleftSidecode codefullWidthcode codemiddleContentcode. p  pThe idea is that I would use a certain combo of divs per page and the others would fade into the background until needed. p  pSo I created the index page and it worked fine. It was a 34 width  rightSide. Now Im creating a full width... and it still seems fine.p  pYet all the research I do regarding multiple layouts on css insist that I use different style sheets even for small layout changes like double columns to full width. I have seen zero reference to using CSS this way but maybe Im using the wrong key words. Creating 3 or 4 stylesheets for a 68 page website seems a little excessive.p  pSo what am I missingp

Negative 23577 pIm currently implementing a version of George Marsaglias Ziggurat random number generator. Although it is supposedly one of the fastest ways to generate good quality normallydistributed random number generators, it is full of loop control code ie. return statements in the middle of a loop, ifstatements, branches, etc and it makes several calls to standard C functions like exp and log. Not to mention the infinite loop.p  pThis makes for code that cannot be pipelined by the compiler. Ultimately, I feel like a basic approach, such as using the central limit theorem directly, might ultimately be faster since it can be pipelined easily. Unfortunately, it is not suitable for the tails of the Gaussian distribution and therefore its not acceptable for my application.p  pDoes anybody here have any ideas on how control code and function calls might be reduced. I am currently using a hrefhttpcolingreenstuff.orgzigguratalgorithmzigguratalgorithm.html relnofollowColin Greens implementation of the algorithma that I ported to C. My underlying uniform generator is the Tiny Mersenne Twister so please dont tell me to use the MT as Ive seen other people do, Im already there.

Negative 23577 pvery noobish question only getting deeper into ROR recently but have been a dev for years.  This is more a conceptual question more than anything.p  pIm working on an app where there might be episodes  ie videos of a show model. All good there.  However the episodes might be 1 of 4 different video providers  so I was thinking of an Embed or VideoProvider model where Id have the provider ie youtube and code with the embed and be able to string replace items.p  pThe episode model will have an embedid pointing to which one of these Embeds were chosen and a videoparam or something field with the replaceable video id  code.p  pThe thing is, following it this way allows me to have the embedid in the episode and the Embed can have many episodes  which means that the Episode actually belongs to the Embed to get the foreign key that way.   Maybe Im being anal but that just doesnt FEEL right  the embed belongs to episode in my mind, but setting up that way wont work.p  pI mean imagine a user  and theres a Gender model I know, dumb for mf but just as example.  If the user needed to choose from mf, the user wouldnt belong to gender gender would belong to user, but again, the foreign key is set up wrong then.p  pSO my question is the idea of belongs to  should I not be so rigid as to what it means OR should I use a join table in these cases which seems overblown.  ie if I have an Episode that is pulling in the Embed by holding its embedid, then who cares...p

Negative 23577 pstrongProblem descriptionstrongp  pI am triing to create attributes, that define how to handle exceptions in my ASP.NET MVC 4 controllers, and actions. Specifically they would set the result what to return to the server. I have almost achieved the desired effect, but there is a problem with call orders. Here is an example of what I am doing currentlyp  precode[DefaultExceptionHandler] public abstract class BaseController     public abstract class AuthorizeController  BaseController  [VeryGoodExceptionHandler] public class VeryGoodController  AuthorizeController   [ViewPageExceptionHandler] public ActionResult ViewPage  throw new Exception Just for demonstration return View   public ActionResult ActionWithoutAttribute  return View   codepre  pThis is the basic structure of my controllers. The attributes are all descendants of the following classp  precodepublic abstract class ExceptionHandlerAttributeBase  FilterAttribute, IExceptionFilter              public void OnExceptionExceptionContext filterContext                                  filterContext.Result  CreateExceptionResultfilterContext.Exception                   protected abstract ActionResult CreateExceptionResultException e      codepre  pCreateExceptionResult can return a JsonResult, a View, a StatusCodeResult, whatever you wish. In my case it always receives a special exception type Some Enterprise Library magic, but that is not a necessity.p  pThe attribute works very nicely, I put it over something, and the OnException method gets called like it should, putting the proper ActionResult in the filterContext, and sending it back to the client. The problem starts, when I want to override the attribute. It happens, that every OnException methods get called, with the same context. When only the controllers are decorated, everything is almost fine, at first, the one put over BaseController gets called, then the one over VeryGoodController, overriding the result. It would be nice to get rid of the base call, but whatever. In the case of the Action, and the controllers decorated, the calling order happens to be the action attributes OnException setting the desired result, the base controllers OnException, and the child controllers OnException overriding the desired result. ExceptionContext doesnt have any attributes to use as a flag for further processing Maybe the Exception attribute could be set to null, but thats not something Id do.p  pstrongQUESTIONstrong So the question is how can I get to a get the OnException method of the Action to be called last, andor if possible b deny the less specific methods from being called in a more efficient way, then just have their result overwrittenp  pstrongSome extra infostrong I have used a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8144695aspnetmvccustomhandleerrorfilterspecifyviewbasedonexceptiontypethisa answer as a reference. Also, if I register the filter in the way described in this post, and do not add the attributes, the same happens.p  pThanks in advance, Robertp

Negative 23577 pOn Machine1, I have a Python2.7 script that computes a big up to 10MB binary string in RAM that Id like to write to a disk file on Machine2, which is a remote machine.  What is the best way to do this  p  pConstraintsp  ul lipBoth machines are Ubuntu 13.04.  The connection between them is fast  they are on the same network.pli lipThe destination directory might not yet exist on Machine2, so it might need to be created.pli lipIf its easy, I would like to avoid writing the string from RAM to a temporary disk file on Machine1.  Does that eliminate solutions that might use a system call to rsyncpli lipBecause the string is binary, it might contain bytes that could be interpreted as a newline.  This would seem to rule out solutions that might use a system call to the echo command on Machine2.pli lipI would like this to be as lightweight on Machine2 as possible.  Thus, I would like to avoid running services like ftp on Machine2 or engage in other configuration activities there.  Plus, I dont understand security that well, and so would like to avoid opening additional ports unless truly necessary.pli lipI have ssh keys set up on Machine1 and Machine2, and would like to use them for authentication.pli lipEDIT Machine1 is running multiple threads, and so it is possible that more than one thread could attempt to write to the same file on Machine2 at overlapping times.  I do not mind the inefficiency caused by having the file written twice or more in this case, but the resulting datafile on Machine2 should not be corrupted by simultaneous writes.  Maybe an OS lock on Machine2 is neededpli ul  pIm rooting for an rsync solution, since it is a selfcontained entity that I understand reasonably well, and requires no configuration on Machine2.p

Negative 23577 pI have a webapp for a school that pulls the locations of both students and faculty when they register for the system. These locations change over time, though students change dorm, staff switch buildings, so Im building a script to update them occasionally. I need to run a query that pulls in a list of userids and building names, and Id like to do it in a single query for personal edificationmasochistic reasons.p  pI have access to a central database that has the following simplified schemap  precodefacstaffuserid, bldgcode studentsuserid, dorm buildingsbldgcode, building  building is the human readable building name codepre  pand the query that Im working with so far looks like thisp  precodeSELECT users.userid, buildings.building  FROM SELECT userid, bldgcode FROM facstaff        UNION        SELECT userid, dorm AS bldgcode FROM students      AS users      INNER JOIN buildings ON users.bldgcodebuildings.bldgcode  WHERE userid in ltlist of usersgt codepre  pnbspp  pThe issue Im having is that many students go on to work in the school after they graduate student entries are not removed from the db on graduation, or will work and study simultaneously, so there are duplicate codeuseridcode after my union, but they have different codebldgcodecode so a simple distinct doesnt work. Basically I get results like thisp  precode  userid    building                 jimbo     Science Sphere          billiam   Dorm E11                dwayne    Humanities Hall         mandar    Science Sphere          foobaz    Administration          fredrick  Physical Plant          fredrick  Dorm A6                 codepre  pFredrick is both a student and a staff member, so two locations come up with his name one from codefacstaffcode and one from codestudentscode. Ideally, there would be a way to enforce distinction in the codeuseridcode column so that the building coming from codefacstaffcode would override anything coming out of codestudentscode. Im open to other solutions though, of course. I appreciate any helpp

Negative 23577 pMy company is currently investigating the integration of Thrift and ActiveMQ. Wed like to set up a languageindependant service layer that runs on a single http server, with each thrift service being able to communicate with other thrift services through ActiveMQ. I have been unable thus far to find anyone else who has tried to implement this. Im curious as to how others might go about implementing this, and whether or not there is documentation on doing so.p  pThe current prototype uses a simple python server that hosts various thrift services. Within each of the service calls i.e., update a setting, an ActiveMQ message is created and sent to a particular queue i.e., a settings service for one app sends out an update message to another. A service listener is created for each implementation of the settings service that is able to scan the appropriate queue and detect when a relevant message is sent over. This listener then uses Thrift to access the appropriate service for that particular application.p  pIm trying to figure out a way to allow a service to serve a thrift object, but also receive ActiveMQ messages without the need to create these listeners, but I have been unable to find any resources for this.p  pThanksp

Negative 23577 pI need to pass a number of items to an API via REST. I need to loop through a set of items and fire each one up to the remote API.

It does consistantly break on one particular individual. Using the codeGetSQLStringcode and codeGetSQLDatecode functions returns  delimited, double  when necessary, pretty strings, and  delimited dates, respectivly, for passing Access queries through to SQL Server in break mode, I duplicated the exact query that was giving me problems in an Access query. It returned a timeout error, but changing the database default timeout and closingopening the db didnt resolve the issue. I pasted the exact same query into SSMS replacing the  date delimiters with  and it executed just fine there taking about 130200 to execute each try.p  pTaking a pause in typing up this post, I put some error trapping in to see if I could get the actual error message SQL Server was returning, when it ran without error. To me, that indicates that it is likely a time out issue. Anyone have a more educated guess as to what it actually is, or a suggestion on how to make the query more efficient so it doesnt time outp

Negative 23577 pI am seeking advice on a design pattern that is a good fit to my needsp  pWithin my C project, one particular purevirtual class will represent the superset of all related functionality for a certain concept, and the concrete classes derived from that purevirtual class will each be some different limited subset of that superset.  Only 1 instance of any of these concrete classes will exist at runtime.p  pIf I were programming in C, I would likely choose to implement this as a struct of function pointers, with NULLs for any missing functionality.  But that doesnt feel very satisfying for C.p  pAbout the only idea I can think of is a class with every member function as protected, and a matching set of public member function pointers.  The constructors would be responsible for initializing the MFPs to either NULL or the address of the appropriate member function, depending on what functionality that class provides.  p  pBut that is really only marginally more Cish than the Cstructoffunctionpointers that I first mentioned above.  And, perhaps it is good enough.  But I am wondering if anyone can suggest a more satisfying, insightful design pattern for this scenario.p  pI am open to any generally accepted practice.  STL is fine.p  psstrongUPDATEstrong The reason why the MFP approach isnt very satisfying, is that I will have to implement donothing stubs for the ones that dont apply because of the purevirtual base class even though I would be setting their respective MFPs to NULL.s  On further reflection, this update was completely bogus.  They will not be donothing stubs, they will be the functionality that is useful, in the cases where NULL isnt used for the MFPs.  I think I was tired.p  pstrongUPDATE 2strong An analogy My project supports hardware modules that can be swapped out.  They are all basically the same category of functionality, but vary in features and capability.  At startup, I must detect which hardware module is actually attached, and instantiate the appropriate class.  But I dont want the code that uses that class to have special knowledge of each of the classes I want the class to advertise what functionality it is providing.  Sometimes, two hardware modules will identify as the same type ID, but upon a capabilities probe, one will indicate functionality that the other does not.p

Negative 23577 pI am trying to use a gesture recognizer in my MyScene.m file to move a sprite when the gesture occurs on the left half of the screen.  To do so I added a subview in the view controller with a frame matching the left side of the screen and a gesture recognizer in MyScene.  The gesture recognizer is in MyScene because it calls a method in MyScene that uses sprites from the same file.p  pThe problem is that my new subview, leftView, cannot be referenced from Myscene.  Is there a way to make that new subview available for use in a different implementation filep  pI have included relevant code for reference below.

I know the css is being correctly enqueued since I can see it showing up in the page source for the website. When I look at specific elements with web inspector it shows that only certain rules are being implemented but not others. Why would transferring my css to Wordpress change how the css rules apply to almost identical HTMLp  pBelow the code for how Im enqueuing scripts.

Negative 23577 pI have a single form written using ASP.NET MVC which I have split into three sections using JQueryUI accordion Info, Contact, and Payment.p  pI have set up a PaymentViewModel with necessary data annotations for validation.

Negative 23577 pI am fairly new to android programming but what I am trying to do seems fairly simple though. I have this setup with 4 different tabs in the action bar, the first should display a Fragment with the Google maps API and the others some other stuff i havent done yet. Following some  tutorials online I managed to get the functionality I wanted for the tabs and get the map to appear. p  pThe app is working fine when changing from the initial tab with the map tab 1 to any other, but when trying to come back it crashes. Weirdly enough when the map fragment is in one of the tabs it makes the second tab crash as well on some transitions, in the image bellow the transitions shown as blue arrows work fine, while the ones with yellow arrows make the app crash. p  pa hrefhttpimageshack.comaimg8394796kf7w.png relnofollowhttpimageshack.comaimg8394796kf7w.pngap  pIf I change the first tab fragment for one of the others all

Negative 23577 pIm trying to use regular expressions to match certain groups of strings which correspond to functions. Right now it looks like thisp  precodeSpreadsheet.[] codepre  pWhere it finds the variable Spreadsheet which has the function as an attribute. The expression keeps going until it gets to the end parenthesis. For simple functions such as p  precodeSpreadsheet.ADD1,2 codepre  pthe regular expression will work fine. p  pHowever, if I try to do any sort of nesting, the expression does not work because it will stop at the inside parenthesis instead of going to the last parenthesis.p  precodeSpreadsheet.ADDSpreadsheet.ADD1, 2, 3 codepre  pThus, the , 3 isnt identified and ends being ignored. Of course, due to the way my code processes it, this unusual string ends up causing an error.p  pDoes anyone with more knowledge of regular expressions know how it could be changed such that it will stop only when it is at the last parenthesis and not the firstp  pThanks.p

Negative 23577 pXorshift and all LFSR type generators will grind to a screeching halt and do nothing if one were to seed it with an allzeros state. It appearsif there isnt a bug in my test, that the following functionp  precodey  onexorshiftroundy y  y  key codepre  pwill be resistant to that kind of lockup, because any nonzero state of y will produce a change to some random value, and any state that is zero will be XORed to something else by the key. If the key emcausesem it to land on a zero, it will fix it next round.p  pI would imagine you would also get the added benefit of every key value producing a different sequence.p  pMy application is an Arduino library that needs statistically random numbers that do not need to have any cryptographic strength at all, but cannot just repeat the same cycle over and over again. What I want to do is use the current count of microseconds since the board was powered on as the key, which should add a bit of entropy to the RNG every time it is useddue to uncertainties in the exact timing of things caused by user inputs and the like, and also cause the random sequence to be different over time, sortof artificially faking having a larger period.p  pMy question is, is there some value of key, or simple pattern of variable key, that would cause the XORSHIFT generator to do something bad, like enter a short cycle Id imagine the math to actually figure it out would be very complicated but maybe someone has a reference to a paper or soomething with a similiarly modified RNGp  pThanksp  pEdit, additional info my first reaction to the issue of the all zeros state was just to add 1 to the state every round, but I found that adding a constant to the state reduced the period by an amount that varied with the constant but did not seem to have any simple pattern.p

Negative 23577 pI have an algorithm that does the followingp  pGiven I have an array codearraycode of length codencode Its goal is to merge certain elements based on some condition it this case entropy. It calculates the entropy codeeallcode of the entire codearraycode and calculates the entropy codeemergedcode of the codearraycode where element codencode and coden1code are merged. It does that for each pair of adjacent elements. The pair where the difference in codeeall  emergedcode is greatest are marged. If there is a merge, the algorithm is applied again on the new codearraycode with length coden1code.p  pAs you can see, this takes in the worst case coden2  1code iterations and if codencode is big it might take minutes or even hours to complete.  Therefore I was wondering how I can parallelise this algorithms. Basically it should be able calculate the entropies on codeicode cores and when all the elements are evaluated the results should be merged and a conclusion can be drawn.p  pHow can I do such a thing Which kinds of code pieces or ideas must I implement for it to work this way Or is there a better wayp  precodepublic double[] applyAlgorithmdouble[] array      boolean merging  false     for int i  0 i lt array.length  1 i          double[] entropy  getEntropyarray  returns list of entropy for all adjacent intervals         int idx  0         double max  Double.NEGATIVEINFINITY         for int j  0 j lt entropy.length j              if entropy[j] gt max                  max  entropy[j]                 idx  j                               if max gt 0              array  mergeAdjacentIntervalsarray, idx merge intervals that have the max entropy, if the entropy is gt 0             merging  true             break                   if merging          array  applyAlgorithmarray          return array   private double[] getEntropydouble[] array      double[] entropy  new double[array.length  1]     double[] tempArray  new double[array.length  1]      double baseEntropy  calculateEntropyarray     for int i  0 i lt entropy.length i          tempArray  mergeAdjacentIntervalsarray, idx         entropy[i]  baseEntropy  calculateEntropytempArray          return entropy  codepre

Negative 23577 pIm working on converting one of our systems from C to c.

With similar methods in the library passing in a System.Array works. With this, no matter what I do no new values are written to the array.

Negative 23577 pIm trying to finally fix my custom shopping cart flow for mobile users by completely rearchitecting my site. Ive chosen jQuery mobile for all my phone, tablet  desktop users.p  pThe actual flow is fairly simple with payment selection paypal or credit card, address input, payment input, confirmation of items..p  pI want the absolute best possible experience tailored nicely to the users screensize.p  pFor phone users I have three or four conceptual pages of information that would map pretty nicely to a jQuery codeuipagecode, however when in tablet Id want to display two or more codeuipagecode items at once  perhaps in a different order with pieces moved around.p  pSome immediate complications spring to mindp  ul liIf I use jQuery pages and the user is on the desktop and he resizes the window to be small what should happen. What should happen in the reverse. Do I direct people to a completely different flow for small screens and larger ones or try to adapt realtime with cssjavascriptli liConsider if the user makes a mistake on a phone, or wants to change his cart. He will swipe left and I need that go to the last logical step he was on.li liI think trying to do tricky codefloatcode css and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15619108responsivedesignwithtwopagesinoneonjquerymobileforcing hidden jQuery pages to be showna based on screen sizes will quickly come back and bite me.li liThe rest of the site doesnt exist yet, for things like adding to cart and I want to figure out a strategy that will work nicely across the whole application.li ul  pMy current best thinking is p  ul liCreate two separate flows. First for the phone which will use true jQuery pages. Second for the desktop which will be just one single page, or possibly two.li liIm considering the first page to be a fully responsive design that would expand out for the desktop but would only contain the first logical step for phone users. So Id be hiding most of the page for small screens. Obviously only phone users could see the buttons that would navigate to the second and third codeuipagecode items. This would result in duplicated fields across multiple pages, but Im ok with that. It would give phone users the proper page experience and history management theyd expect and desktop users would only ever need to see the first codeuipagecode.li liTo get this to work nicely Id need to use KnockoutJS with a single sitewide cart model. This will make it easier to maintain two different flows, and also if I have the same content duplicated on multiple pages it will automagically update when the user switches pages.li ul  pGood idea  bad idea Are there any good examples of a mobile checkout I can look at, or any jQueryKnockout experts have suggestions or see any obvious dangers I should watch out for.p

Negative 23577 pThis should be a simple question about something that Im probably missing from the Spring Data documentation. p  pIm trying to implement a repository extension as described in a hrefhttpdocs.spring.iospringdatadataneo4jdocs3.0.2.RELEASEreferencehtmlprogrammingmodel.htmld0e2970 relnofollowhttpdocs.spring.iospringdatadataneo4jdocs3.0.2.RELEASEreferencehtmlprogrammingmodel.htmld0e2970a.p  pThe code is really simple. I just have a repository and an extension interface and implementation.p  pFirst a repository for codeMyTypecode classp  precodepublic interface MyTypeRepository extends          GraphRepositoryltMyTypegt, MyTypeRepositoryExtension   codepre  pThen the extension interfacep  precodepublic interface MyTypeRepositoryExtension      void anyMethodNameForQuery  codepre  pAnd its implementationp  precodepublic class MyTypeRepositoryExtensionImpl        public void anyMethodNameForQuery            custom query code         codepre  pWith this code, Spring Data throws an error while bootstrapping its mapping infrastructure p  pcodeCaused by org.springframework.data.mapping.PropertyReferenceException No property any found for type MyTypecodep  pAs what Im understanding from this error, any method that is added to the extension interface Spring Data tries to map to a property of the respective type. But that is the only use of repository extensions That is not what I was understanding from the documentation linked above. If that is true what are the alternatives for custom queriesp  pA final observation is that Im aware of codeQuerycode annotation, but my use case require a specific traversal and dynamic query composition.p  hr  pEDIT FURTHER INFORMATION p  pLooking at the documentation again I found some information that might be related to this. In order to configure repository composition it is necessary to change repository scan path from codeorg.example.repositorycode to codeorg.springframework.data.neo4jcode. That is why any method that I put in the codeMyTypeRepositoryExtensioncode interface Spring Data was trying to map to a codeMyTypecode property.p  pIve set Spring Data Neo4j repository scan path as documented, but Ive got many runtime class not found errors such as codejava.io.FileNotFoundException class path resource [javaxenterpriseinjectspiExtension.class] cannot be opened because it does not existcode.p  pIn a tryanderrortotallyadhoc manner I have managed to find some dependencies that could fill out the missing classes.

Also, I think that the documentation needs to define the needed dependencies. And describe how extension repositories and standard repositories interface only can be mixed in a project.p

Negative 23577 pThe situation I have many real life locations with specific information associated with them, and updated frequently. I am unsure of how to store this information for use in an android application.p  pMy original thought was storing the data on some servercloud sourcedatabase, reading from the server from each Activity in the app to make sure the info is up to date, and update the server with any changes that may or may not have been made.p  pFor example there are 200 people inside the library, one person leaves.  So we would read the number of people from the server, display this on the app, person leaves, subtract one, send the new number back to the server.p  pWould this be an incorrect approach Im fairly new to Android in general, and I really have no experience on how to approach this type of situation, what services to use, etc.p

Negative 23577 pSo I have been learning the basics of the JavaScript language. So far so good. Im practicing a lot of comparative operations to understand various calculations and outputs based on my variable definitions. p  pI can define 2 variables and set them.

How would I access user html input in javaScript to perform the same calculation p  pMy first assumption would be that I use the getElementById property to access the value of a textarea element in html. But I am not sure how this would store the textarea value as a variable to then be calculated. I hope this makes sense. p  pThank you to those who will help me with this. I appreciate that your time is important and that this is a VERY basic question for many of you. p

Negative 23577 pThe setup is simple. There is a desktop that has the Point of Sale software on it. It routes all the POS stations through itself and whenever a ticket is needed to be printed, the software sends the info to the printers through ethernet cables to the printers ip addresses.p  pIm trying to figure out an easy way to capture that data in ascii essentially and dont even have to modify it. p  pOne of the answers to this question was to check off the box keep printed documents and then looking in the spool directory, but that only works with regular printers that are directly connected the computer and for which the computer has the drivers. In my case, the POS software itself has all the drivers I guess and there are no options to keep the data that is being printed. p  pI stumbled on this powerpoint thing a hrefhttpwww.apexcctv.composintegration1.pdf relnofollowhttpwww.apexcctv.composintegration1.pdfa and noticed that it has software that will capture the data that is being printed in a .dat file. But the link is broken.  I was wondering if there was any other similar software that could do that easily, or any other way really.p
Negative 23577 pIm building an application which uses Entity Framework version 6 to manage the persistance.  Its all new to me but I am pretty impressed with it so far.p  pI have a problem which I cant seem to find an answer for online due to being swamped by unrelated answers.  Basically I have forms which display the details of entities to the user for editing.  What I would like to do is have a Save Changes button which is enabled and disabled depending on the state of the entity or DbEntityEntry more precisely.p  pI can determine the state of the entity from the Context so determining the state is not a problem.  Its knowing when the state changes that Im having trouble with.  So an entity can be loaded from the data store and presented and initially will be in the unchanged state.  As soon as the user starts editing the form data the entity will become modified due to data binding.p  pWhere should I hook up to be notified of the change to the entity  Should I hook into every controls changed event or the binding source changed event or otherp  pDetails Entity Framework 6, WinForms, MySql Datastorep

Negative 23577 pIm trying to extend the winforms TreeView control to allow incremental filtering and searching similar to the Solution Explorer in VS2012VS2013.  p  pIdeally, I would like it to be capable of replacing the existing TreeView with minimal code change  as far as the consumer is concerned, the only difference would be a method codevoid Filterstringcode.  Because of this, I think it would make sense for the codeNodescode property to return the codeTreeNodeCollectioncode with ALL nodes, even ones not showing because of an applied filter.p  pI have the code written to handle the filtering, and it actually works quite well except when I access codebase.Nodescode, it returns my filtered nodes and not the full list.p  pThe problem I have is, Im unable to clone or create a new instance of codeTreeNodeCollectioncode, because the constructor is marked as internal.  So my ideal code would look something like thisp  precodepublic class TreeViewEx  TreeView       results in a compiler error     private TreeNodeCollection allNodes  new TreeNodeCollection      public new TreeNodeCollection Nodes  get  return allNodes        public TreeNodeCollection FilteredNodes  get  return base.Nodes        public void Filterstring searchString              base.BeginUpdate         base.Nodes.Clear         foreach TreeNode node in FilterInternalallNodes, searchString                      base.Nodes.Addnode                  base.EndUpdate       codepre  pSo as you can see, Im trying to decouple the nodes that are shown in the UI from the nodes that the consumer would access.  Of course with codeTreeNodeCollectioncode having an internal constructor only, Im unable to create a new instance or clone it.p  pI considered these two options, but neither sound like good solutionsp  ol liUse reflection to instantiate the codeTreeNodeCollectioncode object due to the internal constructor for the second list.  This option seems like it would be more efficient than 2, but of course Im creating an instance of an object Im not supposed to.li liInstantiate a second TreeView in memory and use the Nodes property from that to maintain my second list.  This seems like it might be a lot of overhead.li ol  pI want the end result to still be a codeTreeNodeCollectioncode so the TreeView can be used to replace our existing controls with minimal code and we do have several places using the codeFindcode method, which doesnt exist in codeListltTreeNodegtcode.p  pDoes anyone have any recommendations on how to handle this  What about performanceresourcewise with my two considerations  p  pThank youp  pUpdate 1 p  pPer Pats recommendation, I decided to take a step back and avoid messing with codeNodescode altogether.  So now Ive added a codeListltTreeNodegt AllNodescode property and have the codeNodescode just display the nodes that appear in the TreeView the filtered list, so now its a bit simpler.p  pMy problem now is, how do I know when codeAllNodescode has an item added to it so I can keep codeNodescode in sync  Ive considered using a codeBindingListcode so I have the codeListChangedcode event, but then I would need to have my TreeNode and nodes childrengrandchildrenetc codeAllNodes[0].Nodescode use a custom class that inherits from codeTreeNodecode and change the codeNodescode property, and codeTreeNode.Nodescode isnt overridable.  Is there another way  I could make a new property called NodeExs or something, but that seems very unintuitive and I could see another dev coming along later and pulling his hair out because the Nodes property is there but doesnt work.p

Negative 23577 pHi im in the process of investigation other automation tools available on the street.  Currently i have a automation suite that uses the QC QTP stack, with the wpf plugin to hook into our desktop application.p  pIn QTP this give me the opportunity to call the underlying object methods i.e WpfObjectMyCustomView.Object.DataContex.ClearMyViewCommand etc.  We can do this accross the entire application for majority of the controls.p  pFor Coded ui is there a similar process  It appears when i find the object specified i am only able to get the basic object properties and none of the customer underlying methods.  Ive investigate the NativeElement and majority of other methods for alot of the other controls but havnt been able to accomplish the same events.p  pWould anyone have any idea if this is possbible in CodedUIp
Negative 23577 pI have yet to find documentation on what exactly triggers the force update and Ive seen that it behaves differently depending on which lifecycle phase is run. This has led me to the conclusion though that maven certainly cares which phase you are running if you try to force update with a U and ignores the force update if it doesnt need to.p  pId like to force an update even when I am not running a default lifecycle phase directly. My use case is in releasing my app with timestamped snapshot versions with the commandp  precodemvn clean releaseperform releaseprepare U codepre  pIm seeing that even though the snapshots are versioned, internally it is getting the latest SNAPSHOT version in its local repo. If I run codemvn compile Ucode first, then my snapshots are updated, and the release happens as expected.p  pI am curious as to why the timestamp version isnt used to pull the new artifact from nexus, but I figure it has something to do with the more narrowminded release plugin rather than with maven itself.p  pSince Im accepting defeat with the releaseplugin, is there a way to force the update without running a separate and unnecessary lifecycle phase. Or a way to pass in the U to be run by the maven release plugin when building my projectp

Negative 23577 pI have around 100 XML files which I want to transform into another file with a better structure. This example takes it into CSV, but I have also a variant that transforms it into better XML. Format is not that relevant for me. I see there are tons of questions like this, but I find the examples hard to adapt as the problem is not that the stylesheet wouldnt work but that it is too slow.p  pThe sizes of my data files are between 412 MB. The XSLT I have provided here works well with small files. As an example, when I cut a file to 250 KB piece the stylesheet processes it well though this takes already around 30 seconds. When I try it to the actual larger data file it just never seems to finish the job  not even with one file. I have Oxygen XML Editor, Ive been using SaxonHE 9.5.1.2 for the transformation.p  pOne remark this can still be slowish. I can leave my computer to do it for overnight or something. This concerns one malformed dataset and I dont need to repeat this transformation often at all.p  pSo my question isp  pstrongIs there something in this XSLT that makes it work particularly slowly Would some other approch work betterstrongp  pThese are simplified working examples. The actual data files are structurally identical, but have more nodes which I called words in this example. The attribute strongtypestrong specifies which nodes Im after. It is linguistic dialect data with dialectal words and their normalized versions.p  pThis is the XML. p  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gt ltxmlgt ltordergt     ltslot idts1 value1957gt     ltslot idts2 value1957gt     ltslot idts3 value2389gt     ltslot idts4 value2389gt     ltslot idts5 value2389gt     ltslot idts6 value2389gt     ltslot idts7 value3252gt     ltslot idts8 value3252gt     ltslot idts9 value3252gt     ltslot idts10 value3360gt ltordergt ltwords typeoriginal wordgt     ltannotationgt         ltdata id1ts1 id2ts3gt             lttextgtdialectalword1lttextgt         ltdatagt     ltannotationgt     ltannotationgt         ltdata id1ts4 id2ts7gt             lttextgtdialectalword2lttextgt         ltdatagt     ltannotationgt     ltannotationgt         ltdata id1ts8 id2ts10gt             lttextgt,lttextgt         ltdatagt     ltannotationgt ltwordsgt ltwords typenormalized wordgt     ltannotationgt         ltdata id1ts2 id2ts5gt             lttextgtnormalizedword1lttextgt         ltdatagt     ltannotationgt     ltannotationgt         ltdata id1ts6 id2ts9gt             lttextgtnormalizedword2lttextgt         ltdatagt     ltannotationgt ltwordsgt ltxmlgt codepre  pThis is the XSLT.

Negative 23577 pIn my PowerShell script I try to do some error handling. However, Im depending on an advanced function that uses the codeTryCatchcode clauses.

Negative 23577 pI work in OSX environment and have been using Pycharm IDE w 2.7.x anaconda.p  pI drove myself to madness when codepylab.showcode ceased working.  I made myself even loonier when I abandoned that, tried to operate the simplest plot imaginable inside IDLE, and that wouldnt work either.p  pAfter an embarrassingly long time I realized that the plots GUI window was simply being buried very deeply under all the other windows on my desktop.  The programs were working after all.  The plot gui window doesnt make itself very findable.  I have to slide windows around until I can discover it.p  pAnyway, wondering if there is a nicer way to encourage the pylab plot gui window to be more assertive and show itself    I did see some other threads that encourage using codeipython pylabcode, and that is certainly interesting, but its not relevant for instruction in the course Im taking right now.p

I would like to change every element that differs between those two arrays.p  ol liThe array elements must stay in the same order.li liThe operation will be executed very often.li liThe twodimensional Arrays can be up to 100x100 elements large.li ol  pHow would I best achieve thisp  pThe first array is a matrix lets assume 50x50, but this can vary. I will then do a few tests on each element and change the element if certain conditions match. The element is NOT changed in the first array, rather I save all elements in a second array.p  pThe elements can either be O or  Space.br An example array could look like p  pcodeArray  [ , O, O, O,  ],             [ , O,  ,  , O],             [O, O,  , O,  ],             [ , O, O, O, O],             [ ,  ,  , O,  ]code  p  pAfter each iteration one iteration  all the checks ran on all elements, the new array is printed to the user. The reason I want to compare the arrays is that I would like to see which elements changed.p  pSome sample code of what I have so farp  precodeforeach my RowGameBoard      foreach my CurrentCell Row          ltltCOMPARE ELEMENT TO THE CORRESPONDING ELEMENT IN THE OTHER ARRAY HEREgtgt       codepre  pFor some more information on what Id like to do, this is a perl implementation of Conways Game of Life.

Negative 23577 pAfter getting smacked around a little over a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions26809257java100cpuusageherea I went and grabbed the a hrefhttpwww.yourkit.comoverview relnofollowYourKit Java Profilera and got it nicely integrated with Eclipse. Its shown me some things about this application but now Im running into limitations due to my simple lack of experience with Java.p  pThe first chunk of code thats reporting high CPU usage 49 is the following.

Negative 23577 pI have been setting SOLR up to automatically generate IDs for my documents by following this guide a hrefhttpswiki.apache.orgsolrUniqueKey relnofollowhttpswiki.apache.orgsolrUniqueKeya, which is working as intended.p  pNow, when inserting a document, I would like to checkensure that the url field just a string is unique for all documents in the index. So whenever a new document is added, it should just update any existing document if an document already exists with that particular url. The unique id is used to identify a document in another part of the system.p  pI have tried adding url to the url field, but it is just ignored and it is thus still possible to add a document with a nonunique url.p  pIm using SOLR 4.10.2.p  pAny help is greatly appreciatedp

Negative 23577 pI have seen lot of examples where, there is a custom Login page with Angular JS, and then we make a rest POST call with the usernamepwd, and then Spring authenticates based on whatever Auth Service we provide. Then we receive a success, grab the user object from Spring Security and then create a Session cookie in Angular. a hrefhttpsgithub.comjhipsterjhipstersampleappblobmastersrcmainwebappscriptshttpauthinterceptor.js relnofollowhttpsgithub.comjhipsterjhipstersampleappblobmastersrcmainwebappscriptshttpauthinterceptor.jsap  pI also have seen, integrating Siteminder with Spring Security where we install a policy agent on the web server, and then grab request headers with Spring Security, and then pull the roles and build a user profile object.p  pIm looking for a solution where I can combine both the above. This is the scenario p  pWhen the user requests for index.html Angular, the policy agent on the web server intercepts, authenticates with a Siteminder login page and then passes the headers to the app server. The Spring Security on app server will read the headers and pull the roles from our app database and then build a userprofile object. Now here, I want to continue the flow and display angular page, but Im trying to figure out, how do I send the user profile object to angular, because angular is not making a POST call at this point. Also, how do I get the httpauthinterceptor in play, because I need to keep checking if the user is still authenticated on the change of every viewstate in Angular.p  pHelp appreciated  Thanks p
Negative 23577 pI ran into an issue with Xcode 6.1.1 not detecting a unit test file. I ran the scheme it was associated with and the file was found at runtime and ended up with an rT icon next to it in the unit test navigator. That led me to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq19699730449161this questiona but none of the answers are working for me. No amount of deleting my derived data or restarting Xcode is helping. The only thing that came close to working was deleting my derived data folder while Xcode was running  when it reindexed it discovered all of the test files in one of my three schemes.p  pAll these tests had been detected in the past  I think this all broke during reindexing.p  pHas anyone seen this and found a solution I would like my tests to be detected before runtime so I can easily run them individually.p

However, for logging purposes, we want to know when all of the jobs spawned by a single network query have completed. I know I can attach a JobExecutionListener to the queryJob in the config.xml, and then in Java code track all the execution listeners. But I wanted to see if theres a better way to do it. Either a suggested way to define in XML a single job with an arbitrary number of steps defined by input so that I can attach the standard single JobExecutionListener though Spring Batch docs seem to suggest that the best you can do in jobcontrol logic is ifthen, not loops, or else some kind of compound job listener that can be applied to a series of jobLauncher.run calls.p  pYoure also welcome to tell me that I am insane and this is an insane thing to do, as long you say whyp

Negative 23577 pI use MySQL using InnoDB tables with CodeIgniter Datamapper in my PHP application. Often, the user is given the option of deleting a record through the app by initiating a delete function call. When a record has child records onetoone or onetomany, I would also like these records to be deleted along with the parent record, if it is stated by FK constraints in the database.p  pIn this case, I have 2 tables, items and inputlines. I have confirmed that both are using InnoDB. Each item can have many inputlines, so inputlines has a field called itemid, which is set to NULL, indexed, and have FK constraints ON CASCADE DELETE and ON CASCADE UPDATE. I have set the config element in the DM config file asp  precodeconfig[cascadedelete]  FALSE codepre  pBecause in the documentation it says you should do that if you are using ON UPDATEDELETE CASCADE. However, when the user initiates the itemdelete method, only the item is deleted, and the itemid fields on the inputline records associated with the item are set to null.p  pMy models look like thisp  precodeclass Item extends DataMapper     public hasmany  arraylabour, itemtype, inputline, customitemtype    ...   class Inputline extends DataMapper     public hasone  arrayitem   ...  codepre  pI have tried this with cascadedelete  false and true and it wont work. I know the constraints work because deleting the record with MySQL directly works as expected, deleting the child records. p  pWhat am I missing Why is it setting the FK fields to null instead of deleting the recordp  pstrongEDIT 1strongp  pI decided against my better judgment to debug the delete function in datamapper.php libraries directory.p  pI noticed this code in that functionp  precode Delete all has many and has one relations for this object first foreach arrayhasmany, hasone as type      foreach thisgttype as model gt properties               do we want cascading deletes         if properties[cascadedelete]                  .... codepre  pSo I vardumped the contents of properties, and I saw thisp  precodearray size8   class gt string labour length6   otherfield gt string item length4   joinselfas gt string item length4   joinotheras gt string labour length6   jointable gt string  length0   reciprocal gt boolean false   autopopulate gt null   cascadedelete gt boolean true codepre  pIt appears the default for when the model doesnt have the property specifically initialized is overriding the config value. This seems like too glaring a mistake so theres definitely something Im doing wrong somewhere...right I really, really want to avoid hacking the DM core files...p  pstrongEDIT 2strongp  pI was thinking maybe the config file wasnt being found, but I checked the logs and therere entries stating that the Datamapper config file was successfully loaded, so thats not the issue.p

Negative 23577 pI want some parts of my project, which are very rarely changed, to be compiled statically and installed in separate directory. It is necessary because due to some specifics of project quite often it must be recompiled from scratch with removing entire build directory. Installing that statically linked libraries in separate directory will allow to significantly reduce building time.p  pWhat I had at the beginning. Lets say LibA is changed very rarely and I want it to be installed once and not to be rebuild during most of the project builds. LibA depends on some 3rd party imported library LibC. Project also contains LibB which changes frequently and depends on LibA.p  precodeCMakeLists.tst LibB   targetlinklibrariesLibB LibAbuild  CMakeLists.tst LibA   addlibraryLibAbuild ...   addlibraryLibC STATIC IMPORTED   adddependenciesLibAbuild LibC codepre  pIn this case during linking LibB we will have dependencies on LibA strongand LibCstrong. And every time before building LibB we will rebuild LibA.p  pTo avoid unnecessary rebuilds I made new target LibA not LibAbuild. So now LibB depends on LibA.p  precodeCMakeLists.tst LibB   targetlinklibrariesLibB LibA codepre  pThis new target I declared as imported library.p  precodeCMakeLists.tst LibA    This target is for building and installing   addlibraryLibAbuild ...

In fact linking instruction for LibB contains dependency only on LibA, but strongnot on LibCstrong. In case of buildign under Windows it leads to unresolved external linking errors.p  pstrongQuestionstrong How to make static imported library LibA dependent on another static imported library LibC So in case of linking LibB instruction for linking will contain dependencies on both  LibA and LibC.p  pP.S. I know this way is not proper way. I used it only because I didnt find any other way. I would really appreciate if you help me to add this dependency on static import library or suggest another way how to rich goal which I described at the begginning.p

Negative 23577 pIm interested in a formal couplig between a codepoint of declarationcode and a codenamelookupcode concepts.

If   codeS0X,mcode is not empty, codeSX,mcode is codeS0X,mcode otherwise, codeSX,mcode is the   union of codeSNi,mcode for all namespaces codeNicode nominated by usingdirectives   in codeXcode and its inline namespace set.p blockquote  pLet me provide a couple examplesp  p1.p  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt  namespace A      int b  42   int a  Aa Error  namespace A      int a  24   int main stdcout ltlt a ltlt stdendl  codepre  pstronga hrefhttpcoliru.stackedcrooked.comac27a2260df3b916a relnofollowDEMOastrongp  p2.p  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt  namespace A      int b  42   namespace A      int a  24   int a  Aa OK  int main stdcout ltlt a ltlt stdendl  codepre  pstronga hrefhttpcoliru.stackedcrooked.coma32f7340c4715c0b8 relnofollowDEMOastrongp  pThe rule I provided has nothing to do with the point of declaration concept, but in fact we can see that it does.

Negative 23577 pI have implemented a paper for generating tetrahedral mesh for a given 3D polyhedral domain using CGAL. Now I want to emvisuallyem test the implementation against sample input data.p  pBy visually I mean, Given an input polyhedron, I want to trace execution of algorithm on that input and observe construction of mesh step by step without having to repeatedly dump the intermediate mesh to a file for visualization in external tools like Meshlab.

The problem, however, is that, upon running my program, white bars appear around the default background colored codeJPanelcode in the frame. They appear to be padding the panel from the right and the bottom, as though there is space in the frame that the panel is not occupying, although, if my coding is correct, the panel should be the same size as the frames codeContentPanecode, should it notp  pIve found that removing either of the two codepackcode commands does not remove these bars, although removing the first one changes them to black, and removing the second widens the one on the right. Of course, removing both of them causes the frame not to be the same size as its codeContentPanecode. Furthermore, removing the codeaddpanelcode altogether has no effect.p  pI cant figure out what in this code is causing that seemingly empty space to appear in my frame, and, again, in my program, all four values being passed to the codeWindowcode constructor are equal. What seems really strange is that, even if I just remove the codeaddpanelcode, nothing at all changes visa vi the white padding. In fact, I can comment out everything from codemainPane ...code to codeaddpanelcode and that doesnt affect it at all.p

Negative 23577 pI need to restart a service in a powershell script.

Because of that I cant seem to use the codeRestartServicecode cmdlet, instead I need to retry the codeStopServicecode cmdlet a few times. The same applies to starting the service.p  pSo I figure this is a good place to write a function that will take an action start or stop and retry it a few times until it works.

Negative 23577 pIf one application listens to the same private port number previously used by another application on that computer, will the more recent app get the same public port number as the less recent appp  pApplication A and Application B both use nonmulticast UDP. They both run on a computer that is behind a residential router that does not have port forwarding set up. If application A listens to the same private port number behind NAT that application B just finished listening to, will application A receive the same public port number that application B had when application B was using that port Will application A get all the UDP packets meant for application Bp  pAnother closely related questionp  pImagine that computer A and computer B share a residential router. Computer A and computer B both run an application that  sends a UDP packetdatagram to server C at public IP 123.456.789 and public port number 12345. Server C responds by sending a packetdatagram back to the senders. The application that computer A and computer B used, in addition to specifying that it wanted to send on port 12345, also listens on port 12345 for the reply. Computer A and computer B get the reply packet, but the public port number that the server, C, was sending its reply to might not match the number 12345 specified by the application that computer A and computer B are running correct me if I am mistaken, please.p  pNow, for some reason, server C decides that it wants to kill the application that was sending and receiving udp packets to computers A and B and open up a completely different application that will send udp packets to the public IPs and public port numbers that the previous application used to communicate with computers A and B. Will the packets generated by this new server side application go through to computers A and B Or will the death of the old application and the pause between killing the old application and running the new one cause the packets sent by the new server side application to be blocked or rejected by the clients Will the packets make it through the routerNAT p  pWhat if it was the other way around and computer B killed the application that it used to communicate with server C and then opened up a new, different application that internally also listens to udp port 12345. If server C sends another UDP response packet to computer B after computer B kills its old application, will this new, different application get the packets sent by server C that were meant to be a reply to the packets sent by the previous application run by computer B p  pDoes the answer differ depending on the type of NAT and the amount of time between one application finishing using the port and another application starting to use the same port that the other application used previously If so, howp

Negative 23577 pWe use Kendo Grid for heads down data entry in an accounting application. We need the grid to behave similar to QuickBooks. Specifically, users should be able top  ol liTab between cellsli liAutomatically advance to the next row when tabbing off the last cell in a row.li liAutomatically add a new row when tabbing off the last cell of the last row.li ol  pHowever, were having difficulty achieving this behavior. The last cell on the last row does not get saved before adding a new row to the bottom of the grid. If, however, we add a bogus column as the last column the proper behavior is achieved, but you have to tab through an extra, needless column which is unacceptable.

Negative 23577 pI read that Stream are not going to be supported in 12c and any further versions. Is that truep  pWe have two databases source and destination. We were using STREAMS propagation between them but recently we replaced this with Advance queue propagation. As part of that we have changed our source queues now created using DBMSAQADM package instead of DBMSSTREAMSADM, using schedules , subscribers e.t.c. but at destination DB we did not change anything. Still queues on the destination DBs are created using DBMSSTREAMSADM. Also we use Custom apply handlers at destination db.p  pNow considering the point that STREAMS will not be supported after 12c.1, we are planning to use DBMSAQADM package to create destination queues as well. but my question is will apply handler, and apply processes which are created by using DBMSAPPLYADM package will be supported if there wont be nay STREAMS in the futurep  pThanks Peeushp

The way I understand it, is codeSystemWebcode is basically a self running server that utilizes the codeHttplistenercode to listen on a port for an HTTP connection which then processes them up to codeSystemWebcode. Am I getting this part correctp  pCan someone point me in the right direction to an open issue, or a bug tracker where this is currently in development From what I can tell, there are some core functions in codehttp.syscode from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma120735934875631this answera which are required and present in Windows 8.

Negative 23577 pThanks in advance for any help.p  pI am working on a keypad password lick system based on arduino UNO. I have used the password library from Arduinos website. p  pWhat I am trying to accomplish is to set two passwords namely pass1 and pass 2.p  pThe condition is that this circuit is attached to a gate, if user 1 lets say knows pass1, after entering the pass the gate will unlock for 10 seconds and the pass1 becomes invalid i.e. can not be used in future.

Negative 23577 pTroubleshooting someone elses problem over the phone.p  pThe error is trying to connect from one server to another servers db over ssl. The error message is requires a valid client certificate Ive done everything to ensure that they have created the correct cert. I had them debugyes sslhandshake and send me the logs. In their logs they have nothing set for the keystore and the wrong path for the truststore.p  pHerein I think lies the issue. We have an executable jar that reads the paths and passwords for the keystoretruststore and sets the values via calls such as codeSystem.setPropertyjavax.net.ssl.keyStore, config.getKeyStorecode from within the executable. Ive verified at least locally that I can communicate over SSL from 1 server to anothers database in our test environment and all is fine. If I were to remove all of the settings then the error log generated by the sslhandshake gives me the requires a valid client certificate.p  ul liIm told that the destination server with the DB has its pghba file set properly to accept the communication over SSL from the specified id.li liIve verified that the cert is valid from the CA.li ul  pThe only thing that I can think of is that the executable jar is not setting the values to the System via the code System.setPropertyjavax.net.ssl.keyStorep  pIs this a configuration that needs to occur to the Red Hat server to allow the jar to set system properties or is this at the file permission level or   p  pIm at a loss here and would appreciate any guidance on this issue.p  pVery difficult environment.

Negative 23577 pIf your device simulator or iPad is in landscape orientation and you start the app while querying the width you get wrong results.

Where possible, these functions should be reusable not use global variables or fixed sized buffers and robust they should not behave badly under bad input eg empty, null pointers . As well as writing the functions themselves, you must write small programs to test those functions.

Negative 23577 pI really tried hard...I have a RDS MySQL Instance. Its security group is configured with MyIP such that I can access it with MySQL Workbench without any problems. Now I add to the SG my Elasticbeanstalk instance SG just as I do successfully with another Elasticbeanstalk Instance and another RDS DB. In both cases I use the JDBCCONNECTIONSTRING parameter. I ran out of ideas why one beanstalkRDS pair works fine while the other doesnt. I even deleted the RDS instance and created a new one but to no avail. When I have the server output the connection string it is correct. Using the other RDS instance via the JDBCCONNECTIONSTRING parameter, the server connects successfully to the other DB whose SG was added this S2 instance SG.

Negative 23577 pCurrently we have a number of classes that extend codeTemplateMethodModelExcode which we construct using Spring and then inject into the Freemarker codeConfigurationcode as shared variables so they are available as functions to all of our templates.p  pHowever, it would be nicer to have more fine grained control and make these methods available on demand in individual templates.  One can instantiate them using the codenewcode built in, but internally that uses the general Java reflection mechanism for instantiating the class, and these models need to be constructed via Spring to get their dependencies.p  pIn a perfect world, Id like to make it so that the codenewcode built in use Spring to construct the class.  It looks like to do that I would need to find a way to overload codeBeansWrapper.newInstanceClass, Listcode to use Spring, but Im unclear on the best way to accomplish that.p  pNote that we are currently using Freemarker 2.3.23p

Negative 23577 pI want to have a list of objects that satisfies just a few basic requirements. It needs to support fast random access and it needs to be safe to use from multiple threads. Reads will dominate by far and ideally should be about as fast as normal codeArrayListcode access, i.e. no locking. There is no need to insert elements in the middle, delete, or change the value at an index the only mutation required is to be able to append a new element to the end of the list. More specifically a caller will specify an index at which an element should be placed, and the index is expected to be only a few more than the length of the list, i.e. the list is dense. There is also no need for iteration.p  pIs there anything that supports this in Java It can be in a third party library.p  pIf not I am thinking I will implement my own class. Therell be an internal array of arrays, each twice as big as the last. Lookups by index will do just a little more maths to figure out which array has the right element and what the index in that array is. Appends will be similar unless they go beyond the available space, in which case a new array is allocated. Only the creation of a new array will require a lock to be acquired.p  pDoes this sound like a sensible approachp  pThis doesnt sound like a particularly novel data structure. Does it have a namep
