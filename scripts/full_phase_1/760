Positive 760 pIm guessing this is a basic networkingproxy related query... Im new to all these things  p  pYesterday I was trying to experiment with proxies..br I went to the network configuration settings of my codeFirefoxcode browser and in the codemanual proxy settingscode section, I entered a proxy site codegermanproxy.decode and set port as 80.br After that I applied those settingsbr And then when I entered a url lets say codestackoverflow.comcode on the address bar, It took me to the homepage of the proxy site codegermanproxy.decode instead of stackoverflow.br I tried with several other sites but all of them led to the same proxy homepage.  p  pCould anyone please explain why is this happening And what exactly is happening when I set proxy configuration to a website Im guessing this phenomenon doesnt limit only to firefox browser.p  pedit A small mention  the proxy site which Ive mentioned is a gylpe proxy as it says on their website.p
Positive 760 pI have a single node file which does the followingp  pIt listens on two ports 80 and 443 for https. It redirects connections on 80 to 443.p  pAnd on 443 is a reverse proxy that does a roundrobin redirects to several local servers over plain http.p  pThe problem that I have is that in the actual target servers, I am unable to get the actual remote IP address of the browser. I get the address of the reverse proxy. The request is made by the reverse proxy, so thats expected I guess.p  pSo, I did the following in the reverse proxy only relevant code lines shownp  precode    proxy  httpProxy.createServer      var httpsapp  express     https.createServersslCerts, httpsapp.listen443, function        ...            httpsapp.all,functionreq, res          ...         res.appendXForwardedFor,req.connection.remoteAddress         proxy.webreq,res, target localserver         ...      codepre  pI need to do something like res.appendXForwardedFor,req.connection.remoteAddress to the proxy server.. in its request header.  The issue of setting the address is secondary. I first need to set the header itself which can be read by the target server.  The proxy itself does not set this header, which I think it should by default. Or should it Or does it and I am doing something wrong to read itp
Positive 760 pTo begin with, I understand there are other modules such as Requests that would be better suited and simpler to use, but I want to use the socket module to better understand HTTP.p  pI have a simple script that does the followingp  pClient  HTTP Proxy  External Resource GET Google.comp  pI am able to connect to the  HTTP proxy alright, but when I send the GET request headers for google.com to the proxy, it doesnt serve me any response at all.p  precodeusrbinpython import socket import sys    headers  GET  HTTP1.1rn Host google.comrnrn    socket  socket  host  165.139.179.225 proxy server IP port  8080              proxy server port  try     s  socket.socket     s.connecthost,port     s.sendCONNECT 01 HTTP1.1rn  Host 2    3rnrn.formatsocket.gethostbynamesocket.gethostname,1000,port,host     print s.recv1096     s.sendheaders     response  s.recv1096    print response    s.close except socket.error,m    print strm    s.close    sys.exit1 codepre

Positive 760 pA PHP script which creates one big file needs a couple of minutes to run through when it is called. On my website, this script is called via jQuerys AJAX function. Some of our clients use an internet connection that uses a proxy server. These clients report that the AJAX call returns a 502 Bad Gateway error, because the proxy servers timeout limit was reached. To avoid this problem, I added buffer output functionality to the PHP script and extended the AJAX call so that it receives the current file creation status several times while the PHP script is running. Unfortunately, the buffer output does also only work when no proxy server is used.p  pWhich is the bestmost common way to avoid thisp  pstrongUpdatestrong I have extended the existing AJAX request which waits for the file to be created, so that it checks the potentially thrown error and  when indicated  provides a link to recheck the files existence. This does probably work, but it lacks usability.p  pThis is the current shortened JavaScript codep  precodefunction       dataString  someparaampmeters        .ajax         type POST,         url generatefile.php,         cache false,         timeout 300000,         xhrFields              onprogress functione                  bufferOutput p.htmle.target.responseText                                .donefunctionmsg, txtStatus          if.successi.testmsg              fileGeneration.htmllta classcontrastbutton hrefopenFile.php  dataString  gtOpen fileltagt                  else              fileGeneration.html.textError                   .failfunctionmsg, txtStatus, errorThrown          bufferOutput.hide         ifbadgatewayi.testerrorThrown              fileGeneration.html.htmlError, recheck files existence by clicking lta hrefjavascriptcheckFileExistence  dataString  gthereltagt.                  else              fileGeneration.html.textError                 function checkFileExistencedataString      .ajax         method GET,         url fileExists.php,         data dataString          .donefunction msg           ifmsg  1              fileGeneration.htmllta classcontrastbutton hrefopenFile.php  dataString  gtOpen fileltagt                  else ifmsg  0              alertFile does not exist.

Positive 760 pI need to build a codeservercode and a codeclientcode that can exchange data in real time with a companys proxy between them. No one has the authorisation to amend the proxys configuration in order to allow the codeWebSocketcode protocol. p  pI would need a fallback technology such as codelongpollingcode.p  pExample client is a users PC employee. He needs to exchange data with the server, located in the cloud and separated by companys proxy.p  pIdeally, I would use codeWebSocketcode with codeSSLcode, but I know some proxies are not configured for codeWebSocketcode messages and thus could reject the connection.p  pThe app would therefore switch to another codepushcode technology such as codelongpollingcode, increasing the chances of getting a successful connection is 100 guaranteed with proxies Giving that there are several types of proxies...p  pAre there any librariesframeworks proposing such featuresp

Positive 760 pIn C, each of these tasks are relatively easy. I need to open a webpage and login while using an authenticated proxy.p  pThe first approach was to use HTTPWebRequest and HTTPWebResponse to GET and POST to login to the webpage. This worked well, especially with how simply the WebRequest object handles the Proxy object.p  pThe problem with this approach is, there is JavaScript code that appends hidden inputs to the login form. Precompile time I cant know all of the parameters for the POST request.p  pThe next approach was to use the WebBrowser object which worked extremely well for logging in. I just did a GetElementById and set the InnerText for username and password and it happily sent the POST request.p  pThe problem with this approach is that the WebBrowser doesnt make use of the Proxy object. One solution I saw for using a WebBrowser object was to change the Internet SettingsIE programmatically and then login. However, while running multi threaded, each thread will all be on the same proxy undesirable.p  pAre there any elegant solutions for my problem It seems the best i will be able to do is to manually parse the JS and build the POST request myself and send it using HTTPWebRequest. This approach sounds horrible and error prone.p

Negative 760 pI have been asked to write an app which screen scrapes info from an intranet web page and presents the certain info from it in a nice easy to view format. The web page is a real mess and requires the user to click on half a dozen icons to discover if an ordered item has arrived or has been receipted. As you can imagine users find this irritating to say the least and it would be nice to have an app anyone can use that lists the state of their orders in a single screen.p  pYes I know a better solution would be to rewrite the web app but that would involve calling in the vendor and would cost us as small fortune.p  pAnyway while looking into this I discovered the web page I want to scrape is mostly Javascript although it doesnt use any AJAX techniques. Does anyone know if a library or program exists which I could feed with the Javascript and which would then spit out the DOM for my app to parse  p  pI can pretty much write the app in any language but my preference would be JavaFX just so I could have a play with it.p  pThanks for your time.p  pIanp

Negative 760 pWe have a Java application running on the JBed JVM on Windows mobile 6.1.p  pWhen it loses connectivity the application is taking a long time 8  10 minutes to reestablish VPN network connectivity, despite the fact that other applications can see the VPN far sooner roughly 2  3 minutes.p  pFrom our application logs we can see that two network calls each independent of the other  one to establish the IP address of the device on the VPN InetAddress local  InetAddress.getLocalHost, one to open a socket connection  new SocketIP address of host, portare failing repeatedly during both the period where the connection is completely absent and once the connection has been restored to other applications but both calls seem to regain access to the network at the same time the first successful attempt to open a socket happens the first time it is attempted after a successful IP address is obtained.p  pSome other things weve learned  knowp  p1 The device IP address is not used in opening the socket  they are separate routines running in separate threads.  My feeling is that the failure of one does not cause the other, rather they both succeed  fail based on the same underlying reason.p  p2 The call to establish the IP address isnt failing during this period, its just not seeing the VPN connection  the cellular network connection IP address is visible.  When I refer to successfailure its not an exception being thrown, its about it seeing a network connection in the right IP range.p  p3 If you kill the process and restart the application it connects fine, but theres no real code running on start up which could account for that  just the same two calls.p  p4 The attempt to open the socket uses the IP address of the server to make the connection as opposed to a name it would need to resolve.p  p5 Something called Checkpoint is being used to manage the network connectivity  not idea if it may be contributing.p  pIm thinking that there could be some sort of caching  pooling going on at the JVM level which is causing this.p  pDoes anyone have any thoughts on what might be contributing and anything we could try to prevent it  p  pOh, and its Java 1.2.p

Negative 760 pI have and EntryEditor that allows users to add postits views with a UItextView in them onto it and move them around.p  pIm working on handling touch events making it so only one postit is selected at a time, and unselecting the postit if the user touchs outside any postit.  Ive implemented the touch handling in the postits, and Im using notification to tell the EntryEditorController that a postit has been selected, and it resets the selection property on the postits as needed and calls setNeedsDisplay.  This all works fine I can move postits around and only one is selected at a time.p  pHandling touchs outside of any postits is my design issue.

Negative 760 pIn Access 2007, I have a form set up to allow previewing and exporting options for the projects reports.p  pDoCmd.OutputTo seems to behave strangely when dealing with reports that have the Modal property set to true. Modal is currently set to True in the Open event for all of the reports that Im working with.p  pIf I dobrp  precodeDoCmd.OpenReport szReportName, acViewPreview DoCmd.Close acReport, szReportNamecodepre  pThen, focus and control is returned to the executing form normally.p  pIf I export directly instead and use brp  precodeDoCmd.OutputTo acOutputReport, szReportNamecodepre  pThen, the report is exported correctly, but control never returns to the executing form. Its completely disabled. The same code works just fine, if I use Modal  False when opening the report instead. I experimented a little with the reports event hooks to try and figure out what the difference is and codeOnUnloadcode is never hit after codeOutputTocode is called.p  pbrp  pI know I could work around this by only making the report modal when I need it to be modal, but its definitely easiest to do from inside the reports code instead of the module opening it and I really dont think I should be having this problem. I also have no problem exporting the report from preview mode instead of directly from VBA, but apparently the customer does...p  pSo, actual questionsp  ol liIs there any good reason for OutputTo to not trigger the Unload event If this is normal behavior, then fine, but I would at least like to understand the reason for it.li liIs there any way to export a modal report and still regain control of the other windows Or at least, a nonhacky way to reenable and give focus to the calling formli ol

Negative 760 pIm stumped and frustrated so time to ask for help.  Done a lot of googling but yet to find a solution that works for me.p  pWhat I have is a whole bunch of divs that can be sorted using Jquery sortable, some of divs contain a TinyMCE instance.  Which is all fine until you try to move a div that contains a TinyMCE instance  when you do TinyMCE seems to refresh itself and creates a new instance which you then therefore lose the data etc.  And then the whole page breaks as the javascript no longer works .  During this time I get javascript constructor errors etc in Firebug.p  pWhat I have decided the best way to go is when the div starts to get dragged remove tinymce from the text area and when it is placed in its new position insert tinymce back in.p  pI can remove it fine but having trouble adding it back in  as I get more constructor errors.  p  pNote TinyMCE automatically gets added to all my text areas within the system Im using so trying to avoid messing with TinyMCE.p  pIn the code below Im simply targeting a specific textarea id for testing purposes.p  precodecols.sortable                             cursor move,                             revert true,                             opacity 0.6,                             placeholder widgetplaceholder,                             forcePlaceholderSize true,                             connectWith cols,                             zIndex9000,                             cancel .collapsableboxeditpanelgroups, .collapsableboxcontent,                             start functione, ui                                        removes tinymce ok from textarea                                      tinyMCE.execCommand mceRemoveControl, false, textarea1                               ,                             stop functione,ui                                       breaks here  constructor error                                     tinyMCE.execCommand mceAddControl, true, textarea1                                      this.sortable refresh                                                    codepre  pAnybody else have any other solutions  If you need more information please let me p

Negative 760 pThe  LAN which has about a half dozen windows xp professional pcs and one windows 7 professional pc.p  pA jetaccess 97 database file is acting as the database. p  pThe method of acccess is via dao DAO350.dll and the front end app is written in vb6. When an instance is created it immediately opens a global database object which it keeps open for the duration of its lifetime.p  pThe windows 7 machine was acting as the fileserver for the last few months without any glitches.p  pWithin the last week whats happened is that instances of the app will work for a while say 30 mins on the xp machines and then will fail on database operations, reporting connection errors eg disk or network error or unable to find such and such a table. Instances on the windows 7 machine work normally.p  pMoving the database file to one of the xp machines has the effect that the app works fine on ALL the xp machines but the error occurs on the windows 7 machine instead.p  pJust before the problem became apparent a newer version of the app was installed. Uninstalling and installing the previous version did not solve the problem.p  pNo other network changes that I know of were made although I am not entirely sure about this as the hardware guy did apparently visit about the same time the problems arose, perhaps even to do something concerning online backing up of data.

Any suggestions would be gretly appreciatedp  pstrongUPDATE 08022011strongp  pThe issue has been resolved by the hardware guy who visited the client today. The problem was that on this particular LAN the IP addresses were allocated dynamically except for the Win 7 machine which had a static IP address. The static address happened to lie within the range from which the dynamic addresses were being selected. This wasnt a problem until last week when a dynamic address was generated that matched the static one and gave rise to the problems I described above.p  pThanks to everyone for their input and thanks for not closing the question.  Having smart knowledgeable people to call on is a great help when youre under pressure from an unhappy customer and the gaps in your own knowledge mean that you cant confidently state that your software is definitely not to blame. p

But occasionally the ZMI sure is useful for inspecting a workflow, or examining a content items permissions, or installing only one part of a profile via portalsetup. Is there really nothing worth knowing about the ZMI Or are there other useful little tidbits in therep

Negative 760 pThanks ahead of time.  I am currently developing the iPad version of an app which on the iphone has 3 tabs,which each load 3 different rss feeds and then drill down to details with a navigation controller on the iPhone.

Negative 760 pIve found a strange problem with a Samsung Galaxy S phone that I cannot replicate on several other Android phones. I have several 40x40dip ImageButtons placed at the very bottom of the screen in a row. I can accurately press all these buttons on phones like the Droid and the Desire.p  pOn the Samsung Galaxy S, it appears that the bottom few millimetres of the screen does not generate any touch events at all. To the user, it looks as if the buttons seem to only randomly respond to touch, but they work fine if you aim for their top edge. I can replicate this problem on the home screen as well where the much larger home screen buttons do not respond if you tap them at the very bottom. Has anyone else noticed this issue and had to workaround this Is it common Im wondering if it a defect specific to the single handset I tried.p  pThe only solution I can see is to make the buttons bigger but I dont want them taking up too much screen space as Im making a CAD program and want the user to see more of the work area. p

Negative 760 pSo, all of the sudden when I try to access a newly created controller in my ASP.NET MVC 3 app, it returns a 404 error. Ive made sure that the controller is named properly, the route match according to the RouteDebugger, and Ive confirmed that a folder for the controller exists in the Views folder and that the properly named View for the action also exists. All of this is in an Area. Oh, and Im running this on the Visual Studio dev server, not on IIS.p  pSo, Ive been at it for about 2 hours and am not getting anywhere, so Im hoping someone here can point me in the right direction. Heres the source for the controller and routesp  precode  AdministrationAreaRegistration.cs public override void RegisterArea     AreaRegistrationContext AreaRegistrationContext      AreaRegistrationContext.MapRoute8UVhDc, AdministrationcontrollerDocumentTypeId, new          action  List     , new          controller  Documents,         DocumentTypeId  d          DocumentsController.cs public sealed class DocumentsController  AdminController      [Inject]     public DocumentsController         CookieManager CookieManager,         DocumentTypeManager DocumentTypeManager          baseCookieManager CookieManager, DocumentTypeManager DocumentTypeManager            [HttpGet]     public ActionResult List         short DocumentTypeId          return this.Viewnew AdministrationView              Cookie  base.Cookie,             DocumentTypes  base.DocumentTypes                codepre  pAnd ofcourse, theres a folder named Documents in the Views folder, and in the Documents folder there is a view named List. As far as I can tell, I shouldnt be getting this error that probably is something a programmer shouldnt say...p  pAnyway, it would be superduper awesome if someone points out what Im obviously screwing up.

Negative 760 pat the moment Im writing a kind of lib, which gets from outside the file name sFilename. With it data were written to a file it will be created, data were append to an existing file with data, data were updated in an existing file with data or the data were read from an existing data.p  pThe user of the application with my lib should get as much as possible on information about errors of file handling. p  pFor this purpose I code a method FileExists... which uses stat to determine if a file exists or not and a method bool checkPermissionstdstring sFilename, CFileEOpenmode iOpenmode which gives back a bool if the specified file sFilename with the iOpenmode Read, Write, Readwrite have the permission to be read, written or read and written.p  pThis method works with statsFilename.cstr, ampbuf too and gives the desired information of the file back in buf.p  pBefore checking any file I want to check if the directory containing the specified file has the desired permissions and for that I want to use the checkPermission method [works with stat] for the directoryp  pNow the problem how can I determine easyly the containing directory If the user just give a filename test.txt the file will be created or read in working directory. So its easy to get the updirectory. Its the same like the working directory. And there its simple to use checkPermission to get detailed information about the directory.p  pBut what about when the user not only give the file name For exaample ....test.txt or dir1dir2test.txt. How to combine the working directory with a specific path to gain the updirectory of the file and then to check the permissionsp  pPhew, I hope all is clear and it wasnt too long p  pRumop

Negative 760 pIve got a reasonably pumped processor Core 2 Quad benching around 13rd of the best money can buy, 4GB RAM, yet I cant seem to strike a Linux distrovirtualization combo that simply is responsive enough for typical development work.p  pFor example, the cursor motion in IntelliJ IDEA is simply not consistent and responsive enough to move and edit accurately.p  pFlipping over to a running Firefox takes a few seconds, even switching between tabs in Firefox isnt instant. p  pIn the host OS, Windows 7, app switches, tab switches etc everything happens instantly.p  pIve tried Ubuntu and Kubuntu 11.04. Ive tried VirtualBox and VMWare.  All had very different responses. None good enough.p  pIve played around with RAM settings etc and maybe theres some config setting I missing. Im not trying to find the cause here on SO, but I would just first like to know if I have my head in the clouds thinking I can develop on virtualized Linux at the speed I did in Windowsp  pThe distros I tried, especially Ubuntu, looked like theyd been dumbed down for the general user. Do I need to find an older distro, or something a bit rawer I only want a desktop to hold multiple windows, run apps from and look graphically pleasant. No bloatware or fancy effects or LCD clocks ahhhh...p  pOr does virtualization just require the ultimate in hardware Ive just switched over to Linux with very little knowledge of it and have no idea if its the virtualization, my machine or simply the distros Ive tried.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI fiddled around some more but as soon as a second app was on screen, response suffered.

Negative 760 pI vaguely remember seeing something in OpenGL not ES, which was still at v1.0 on the iPhone when I came across this, which is why I never used it that let me specify which edges of my polygons were considered outlines vs those that made up the interior of faces.  As such, this isnt the same as the outline of the entire model which I know how to do, but rather the outline of a planar face with all its tris basically blended into one poly.  For instance, in a cube made up of tris, each face is actually two tris.  I want to render the outline of the square, but not the diagonal across the face.  Same thing with a hexagon.  That takes four tris, but just one outline for the face.p  pNow yes, I know I can simply test all the edges to see if they share coplanar faces, but I could have sworn I remember seeing somewhere when youre defining the tri mesh data where you could say this line outlines a face whereas this one is inside a face. That way when rendering, you could set a flag that basically says Give me a wireframe, but only the wires around the edges of complete faces, not around the tris that make them up.p  pBTW, my target is all platforms that support OpenGL ES 2.0 but my dev platform is iOS.  Again, this Im pretty sure was originally in OpenGL and may have been depreciated once shaders came on the scene, but I cant even find a reference to this feature to check if thats the case.p  pThe only way I know now is to have one set of vertices, but two separate sets of indices... one for rendering tris, and another for rendering the wireframes of the faces.  Its a real pain since I end up handcoding a lot of this, which again, Im 99 sure you can define when rendering the lines.p

Negative 760 pBack in World War II and WWI apparently, encryption schemes used by the warring parties kept getting cracked.  Then some genius who understood language realized that sending messages in an esoteric natural language would be better than any cipher, due to the enormous differences that languages can bear to one another in terms of syntaxe.g. Navajo vs. Japanese.  Codes based on Navajo went uncracked.  The title is a movie reference.p  pSo you can see where this is going.  Whats a good language, emwith an available native compilerem, that few people know yet is powerful enough in which to write, say, a key authentication module  I thought of Cobol but couldnt find a native compiler, by which I mean a compiler that compiles directly into machine language and not by first translating into C or some other standard language and then compiling the C.p  pI realize that at the assembly level its probably all the same, but I still think being able to write unreadable highlevel code might help in some situations.p

Negative 760 ptldr is it possible to have grouping levels within a subreport which gets its data entirely from the main report I need to produce a single report which takes a single set of data and displays four or more different summarizationscalculations on the data.p  pp  pIt would be easy enough to make a separate stored procedure call in each subreport. But since a lot of the data will be common to all of the subreports, Id like to avoid the performance cost of getting the same data from SQL Server repeatedly. p  pId like to get all the raw data once, from a single stored procedure, and link that data to the various subreports within the single .RPT file. So far it seems that I cannot use the Group Expert in a subreport that does not call a stored procedure  there are no Report Fields displayed to select for grouping. p  pThe subreports could be described as cost summaries, calculated as follows A summary for all months, A breakdown of just the current month, calculated averages per personmonth, and multiple cost breakdowns by plan for the current month. p  pFor the first subreport, I can get the desired data as parameters, by linking desired fields and parameters from the main report. I would need to group this to group this data by the month of a particular date column, with one row per month and a grand total at the end. But if I click on the Group Expert in that subreport, there are no Report Fields available for me to group by. p  pSince all of the calculations involve a single set of data, Id like to just get that set from a single stored proc call, and have Crystal perform the various calculations.p  pCan this be done in Crystal Reports XI, with or without subreports, without having multiple calls to the database that return the same data more than oncep

So thats not adding up....p  pInside the table Ive got a tbody that is displaytablerowgroup, widthauto, and is 1456px wide.  Inside that Ive got a tr that is displaytablerow, width100 and is 1456px wide.  Good so far....p  pInside that Ive got a td that is displaytablecell, width20, and is 67px wide.  Thats definitely not 20 of 1456.  Another td in there is displaytablecell, width 40, and is 1218px wide.  Thats far more than 40 of 1456.  Generally it looks like my widths are being driven by my content and my tds are delightfully ignoring the percentages theyve been assigned.  One of my tds is widthauto, so it should be able to absorb all the leftover width in the row once the others have taken their respective percentagesp  pAre there any common pitfalls that I may have fallen into herep

Negative 760 pSo the problem is were using a set of components that update frequently. Instead of having to make sure that every development machine has the same version, it would be a whole lot easier to just have the used components in a central location on a shared drive, so that all the references could be pointed to them.p  pThe problem is, though, that Visual Studio doesnt like this. If I add a reference pointing to the shared drive, I get the Operation is not supported error, which, according to googling, is because of some security settings. I tried most things I found, ie. adding a codeltloadFromRemoteSource enabledtruegtcode tag to sgen.exe.config, my app.config and even the devenv.exe.config. I also made sure the dll is not blocked nor readonly. But the problem persists.p  pAs soon as I simply copy the dllfile to a local drive and change the reference accordingly, everything works fine. But Id much prefer just using it from a shared drive.p  pOh and I should probably mention that Im using VS2010 and .NET 4.0.p

Negative 760 pI have functioning RMI clientserver system. The servers host information is known to the clients so they can look it up and make calls. On first call to the server, the clients pass the server a remote reference of themselves so that the server can make callbacks.

Negative 760 pHeres a question Ive been racking my brain over. Lets say I have a table that has a series of timestamps and a part number as the primary key. The table stores incremental changes, meaning that for every timestamp, if a field changes, that change is recorded. If the field doesnt change, then for the new timestamp it is NULL. Heres the basic idea.p  precode part  timestamp  xpos  ypos  status   a5          151      5     15       g  a5          153   NULL     17    NULL codepre  pcodepart, timestampcode is the primary key. The codeNULLcodes in the second record indicate values that are unchanged since the first record.p  pWhat I want to be able to do is select the most recent values for each field grouped by the part. For example, given the above entries, the results will be 153,5,17,g for part a5.p  pAs of now, I have this hacked together query.p  precode    SELECT xpos FROM partchanges WHERE xpos IS NOT NULL     ORDER BY timestamp DESC     LIMIT 1      UNION      SELECT ypos FROM partchangesWHERE ypos IS NOT NULL     ORDER BY timestamp DESC     LIMIT 1      UNION      SELECT status FROM partchanges WHERE status IS NOT NULL     ORDER BY timestamp DESC     LIMIT 1 codepre  pBut this returns a single column, meaning that I can use a groupby for organizing.p  pTheres got to be a more elegant way of doing thing, such as using COALESCE or IS NULL in a creative way. But Im stuck and cant figure it out. Anybody got an idea p  pAnd no, I cant change the database structure.p  pEDIT ruakh has the right idea. The only problem now is grouping by part. I cant seem to get around the codeLIMIT 1code for grouping by multiple parts. Any ideas p  pmdahlman, Im not too familiar with analytic functions in postgresql. So, if that solution would be easier than a complex query, then by all means post your idea.p  pEDIT 2 Thank you all for the help. I think Ive got a good enough grasp of what I need to do.p

Negative 760 pIt would be more convenient for me to register a unique codeOnClickListenercode for each row in the codeListViewcode, but I want to be sure that this is an acceptable practice.  My a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma9721849403455current designa is a rather convoluted way to separate the concerns of the codeOnClickListenercode from each row type.p  pThe reason for this is that I have multiple classes of rows in the codeListViewcode.  Each class has a completely different responsibility and behavior.  For example, consider a codeListViewcode that can contain both subcategories and book titles.  If a book title is clicked, a new activity should start that shows the cover image.  If a subcategory is clicked, a new list of books and categories is displayed.p  pId like the row itself to maintain knowledge about its own identity and responsibility rather than having to leak the knowledge about each row to be maintained by the implementer of codeonItemClickListenercode.p  pId also like to know what the performance implications are of doing this vs. implementing my own logic to figure out how to handle the click.p  pAre there drawbacks to implementing codeonClickListenercode for each codeListViewcode codeArrayAdaptercode row instead of codeonItemClickListenercode  Im looking for emconcrete dataem and emspecific drawbacksem rather than vague recommendations.p  pShould I expect emmemory useem, eminitialization timeem, or emsteadystate speedem like scrolling through the list to be significantly affectedp

Basically each row is entered and the first column is checked to see if it matches any of the in the ArrayList with the same team attribute. if it finds a match it processes it and removes it, it continues on until the end of the list and then exits to repeat the process on the next row.p  pIt seems to work, however when it finds a match and processes it inclding removing it it doesnt seem to continue looking in the inner loop for more matches.p  pCan anyone please tell me why it is not continuing to loopp  pHere is my codep  precodeprivate String[][] addScoresString[][] dataTable              forint r  0 r lt dataTable.length r                      IteratorltResultgt itr  outcomes.iterator             Result temp  new Result             whileitr.hasNext                              temp  itr.next                 If a team is found.                 if dataTable[r][0]  temp.team                                      Increases matches played.                     dataTable[r][1]  String.valueOfInteger.parseIntdataTable[r][1]  1                     iftemp.result  WIN                                              dataTable[r][2]  String.valueOfInteger.parseIntdataTable[r][2]  1                                          iftemp.result  DRAW                                              dataTable[r][3]  String.valueOfInteger.parseIntdataTable[r][3]  1                                          iftemp.result  LOSE                                              dataTable[r][4]  String.valueOfInteger.parseIntdataTable[r][4]  1                                          removes entry.                     itr.remove                      break                                                                    return dataTable      codepre

Negative 760 pIm implementing my own matrix math for an OpenGL application. So far, things are largely fine, although difficult. My most recent issue, one Ive not had much luck on getting an explanation or a specific problem pointed out to me, is to do with my implementation of glOrtho.p  pSpecifically, my version results in the matrix[14] element being negative zero. 0.000000 while the version that I glGet from OpenGL after using the deprecated glOrtho is a normal zero. 0.000000p  pI dont know if this affects things any, but I am disturbed by my math not matching.p  pglOrthos OpenGL specification, for reference, which I believe Im following properly, and doing the math correctly for a hrefhttpwww.opengl.orgsdkdocsmanxhtmlglOrtho.xml relnofollowhttpwww.opengl.orgsdkdocsmanxhtmlglOrtho.xmlap  pMy own glOrtho functionp  precodevect UtilsOrthoMatrixvect outmatrix, const vect left, const vect right, const vect bottom, const vect top, const vect znear, const vect zfar      memcpyoutmatrix, zeroMatrix, 16sizeofvect      outmatrix[0]  2.0f  right  left     outmatrix[5]  2.0f  top  bottom     outmatrix[10]  2.0f  zfar  znear     outmatrix[12]  right  left  right  left     outmatrix[13]  top  bottom  top  bottom     outmatrix[14]  zfar  znear  zfar  znear     outmatrix[15]  1.0f      return outmatrix codepre  pMy resizing functionstripped down considerably for readabilityp  precodevoid GameLogicOnResizeint width, int height  For purposes of this test, width  640, height  480.      ifheight  0  Avoid potential dividebyzero         height  1      glViewport0, 0, width, height      UtilsOrthoMatrixmorthoMatrix, 0.0f, GLfloatwidth, GLfloatheight, 0.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f       Setup fixed function OpenGL to compare against.     glMatrixModeGLPROJECTION     glLoadIdentity     glOrtho0.0f, GLfloatwidth, GLfloatheight, 0.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f      glMatrixModeGLMODELVIEW     glLoadIdentity codepre  precodevoid GameLogicRender  Drastically cut down to illustrate issue.      vect modelviewmatrix[16], projectionmatrix[16]     glGetFloatvGLMODELVIEWMATRIX, modelviewmatrix      glGetFloatvGLPROJECTIONMATRIX, projectionmatrix      At this point, projectionmatrix and morthoMatrix are identical,      except in the matrix[14] element, which is 0.000000 for projectionmatrix,      and 0.000000 for morthoMatrix.  codepre  pI cant quite figure out why this could be, or what it effects The math checks out as correct as far as I can see, so it should be negative zero, yet OpenGL is returning positive zero. My best guess so far is some sort of driver quirk where the driver is fudging the numbers to avoid negative zero Ive tested this code on two separate nVidia GPUs and gotten the same result. Dont have access to something ATI or similar to test with too.p  pDisclaimer Im somewhat clueless as to how glOrthos near and far values work, although the specification does specify that negative values are allowed.p  pShould I be initializing my projection matrix with an identity matrix, or multiplying an identity matrix into the perspective matrix I dont...think I need to do that, and my glFrustum implementation appears to have been working okay without doing that, but maybe thats it I dont understand the math well enough to know if that should be done for correctness or not.p  pAny ideas, anyone, on what Im doing wrong or misunderstanding Or if Ive indeed found some sort of odd quirk An explanation of what, if anything, using negative zero might effect would be good, as well, if its advised that the best course is to just go with it, rather than try to adjust the values from what Im currently gettingp

Now I want to persist this information across multiple pages so I am storing this in session, since its just an html table and not a heavy duty control like a grid, whats the best way to store the HTML table in session or any other way and how can I access this in Javascript or Jquery on the client side so I can utilize Jquery functions to show an expandable div displaying this information p  precodeprotected void BtnAddDock1Clickobject sender, EventArgs e              try                      HtmlGenericControl RadDocksDiv  HtmlGenericControlMaster.FindControlRadDocksDiv             RadDocksDiv.Style[display]  block              Session[Docking]  Open              Table tblErrors  new Table             tblErrors.ID  tblErrors             tblErrors.CssClass  tabularData             tblErrors.Width  800             TableHeaderRow hr  new TableHeaderRow              hr.ID  tblErrorsHeaderRow             TableHeaderCell thc  new TableHeaderCell             thc.ID  tblErrorsHeaderCell             thc.Text  Error Descriptions             hr.Cells.Addthc             tblErrors.Rows.Addhr             Panel pnlErrors  PanelMaster.FindControlpnlErrors              Table dobleTable  TableMaster.FindControltblErrors              if dobleTable  null                              pnlErrors.Controls.AddtblErrors                    for int i  0 i lt 10 i                                      TableRow tableRow  new TableRow                     string error  This is a website generated Import Error that needs to be added to the panel on Masterpage                     TableCell tableCell  new TableCell                     tableCell.Text  error                     tableRow.Cells.AddtableCell                     tblErrors.Rows.AddtableRow                                    Session[ErrorsTable]  tblErrors                          Table tblErrors  TableMaster.FindControltblErrors                    catch Exception ex                      throw ex               codepre  pand here is how I am trying to get this in Javascript but all I can see is just System.Web.UI.WebControls.Table when I try to get it from session.p  precode    Access html table in  session     var dockingState  lt Session[Docking] gt      if dockingState  Open            This doesnt return the html table correctly         var sessiontblErrors  lt Session[ErrorsTable] gt          if sessiontblErrors  null              var pnlErrors  [idpnlErrors]                codepre

Negative 760 pCurrently Im facing the problem, that I try to design a DAL for my .NET application, which will later use some sort of NoSQL database.br The NoSQL databases I evaluated by now sometimes differ in the type they use as primary key. For example, MongoDB uses a proprietary codeObjectIDcode while RavenDB uses a common codestringcode. So my question is, how do I design such a DAL which can handle different types of domain model ids.p  pMy first approach was to make generic domain models. This looked something like thisp  precode Domain Model public class FilterltTIdgt    public TId Id  get set     ...    DAOinterface public interface IFilterDaoltTIdgt    bool PersistFilterltTIdgt    ...

RavenDB couldnt work with codeobjectcode, because it needs a string. Using codedynamiccode I couldnt pass lambdas to the RavenDB API Compiler error An expression tree may not contain a dynamic operation occured. And building expression trees instead of using lambdas is really the last way out because its way more timeconsuming.p  pSo Im totally stuck and I hope someone can help me out. Thanks in advance.p  pUPDATE I finally got RavenDB to work with codeobjectcode, but its not a satisfying solution to use codeobjectcode.p

Negative 760 pI am using the following code to attempt to get the font color of my navigation links to animate on hoveroff hover. The border bottom color changes correctly but the font color does not. Also it is throwing off my currentmenuitem CSS rule for a different color.

Negative 760 pI am experience a strange performance issue when accessing data from SQL Server from a Spring based application. In my current setup, the Spring java application runs on a separate machine accessing data from a remote SQL Server DB. I am using NamedParameterTemplate in Spring, which I believe uses Prepared Statement to execute the query. For some reason, some of the query takes a long time to complete approx. 2 mins. The JAVA app runs on a 64bit machine running 64bit version of Java v1.6, and the SQL Server is MS SQL Server 2008 R2.p  pThe strangeness, is if I run the same java app from my laptop running Windows XP 32bit, running the same version of Java v1.6, the query takes less than a second, accessing the exact same remote DB server infact, I am connected through VPNp  pThis shows the issue is not with the Spring framework but may be with the SQL JDBC Driver. I am using Microsoft JDBC Driver 4.0 for SQL Server sqljdbc.jarp  pI am completely clueless, as what could possibly be wrong and not sure where to start my debugging process. I understand, there isnt much information in my question, so please let me know if you need any specific detail.p  pThanks for any helpsuggestions.p

Negative 760 pSo I am writing a Ruby program for school that changes the value of a boolean to true if a certain value is either 1 or 3, and to false if it is 0 or 2.  Since I come from a Java background, I thought that this code should work codeif n  1  n  3codep  pBut it does not.  So my question here is is it possible to use an Or expression thingy in If blocks in Ruby  I know that my current situation could be solved easily by just something like the followingp  precodeif n  0     tof  false elsif n  1     tof  true codepre  pEt Cetera.  But I want to know if I can use an Or in If blocks for the future.p

Negative 760 pI have an image gallery where I want the images horizontally centered on the page.  I want to have the image meta data, title, artistname etc, positioned just to the right of that image.  p  pFirst I tried floating the image and the metadata side by side inside a containing div, but then the image is no longer centered according to the page because the overall containing div width is used for centering.  Also, I dont know the width of the containing div should be since I dont know the width of the image, its dynamic.  I prefer not to set a hardcoded width on the div because I want to let the image scale down depending on the devise.p  pThen I tried using codedisplaytable displayrow displaycellcode, where the image was in the left cell and the meta data was in the right cell.  The table would stretch to the width of the image, which was great.  I then put codepositionrelativecode on the meta data tablecell and then codepositiveabsolutecode the a div which contained the meta data off to the right.  This worked great in most browsers but didnt display correctly in FF.  I found that codetablecellcode and codepositionrelativecode didnt mix well... even if the codepositionrelativecode was nested in a different element.p  pSo then I tried putting both the image and meta data elements in a containing div that was codedisplayinlineblock positiverelativecode.  Again this stretched around my content without extending all the way to the max width, the way a regular codedisplayblockcode does, which was great.  Again I positioned the meta data absolutely to the right.  It looks great in chrome, ff and safari... BUT, now my dynamic image scaling breaks.  I had size the image codemaxwidth100code so that it will scale down for mobile devices.  But in FF this doesnt work.  I supposed the image cant get a read on what the width is on the inlineblock  I tried putting another div around the image that was codedisplayblockcode but that still doesnt work.p  pWhat is a good way of centering the images, yet have a piece of text positioned flush to its right, yet still have image respond to codemaxwidth100code when scaledp  pa hrefhttpwww.sketchfemme.compopular relnofollowExamplea of what I have so far p

Negative 760 pemI am using sound files from the library, not URLs.emp  pI am making a soundboard and have a button that plays background music. The reason I have a button instead of automatically playing on load is that there are a few different background musics to choose from, each with their own button.p  pI also have several other buttons that play sounds. I want the background music volume to lower to something like 0.3 while other sounds are playing. I believe I need to create a variable like soundCount that goes up when a sound plays, and decreases when the sound finishes playing so that if there are multiple sounds playing at once, the background music wont go back to normal until the count is at 0.p  pWhats the best way to set this up I made the soundCount variable but Im having trouble creating an event listener for when sound effect finishes playing.p

Negative 760 pIm doing this project trying to reproduce Schellings Segregation model.

Negative 760 pI am running some experiments to benchmark the time it takes by mapreduce to read and process data stored on HDFS with varying parameters. I use pig script to launch mapreduce jobs.

Caching can happen at two levelsp  ol liCached in memory of machine codeSTOREcode inmemory file cacheli liCached in memorydisk of machine codeCOMPUTEcode.li ol  pI am pretty sure that code1code caching happens. I want to ensure whether something like code2code happens From the post a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10099816whatdoeslocalcachingofdatameaninthecontextofthisarticleherea, it looks like there is no client level caching going on since it is very unlikely that the block cached by codeCOMPUTEcode will be needed again in the same machine before the cache is flushed.p  pAlso, is the hadoop distributed cache used only to distribute any application specific files not task specific input data files to all task tracker nodes Or is the task specific input file data like the codefoocode file block cached in the distributed cache I assume codelocal.cache.sizecode and related parameters only control the distributed cache. p  pPlease clarify.p

Negative 760 pI have a chat server in C, running in linux and using the libev libraries. If I try to connect more than 1024 clients it will crash with a 1 file descriptor. p  pI would like to allow more than 1024 concurrent connections to be made to the server.

Negative 760 pIn the interest of always showing a friendly error page to users when they visit a site I have a catchall at the in the Global.asax page, the majority of errors are handled by filters which seems to be the preferred method. For the most part, this works fine. However, during ApplicationStart, the ApplicationError event understandably does not get triggered.p  pMy ApplicationStart event contains some initialisation code which is dependent on a service call, so an easily defined point of failure is if the service is unavailable for whatever reason. The only way Ive found to get around this is to do the following.p  precode    private static Exception StartUpException     protected void ApplicationStart              AreaRegistration.RegisterAllAreas         FilterConfig.RegisterGlobalFiltersGlobalFilters.Filters         RouteConfig.RegisterRoutesRouteTable.Routes         Initialise                  private void Initialise              StartUpException  null         try                      Bootstrapper.Initialise                  catch Exception ex                      StartUpException  ex               codepre  pThen I have the following code in the ApplicationBeginRequestp  precode    protected void ApplicationBeginRequestobject sender, EventArgs e              if StartUpException  null                      HandleErrorAndRedirectStartUpException             HttpRuntime.UnloadAppDomain             Response.End               codepre  pThis works, but seems like a bit of a hack. Im also not sure about the consequences of calling UnloadAppDomain, or what would happen if multiple requests arrived. Is there a better way to manage thisp
Negative 760 pI have a Magento 1.7 store with USD base currency. I display prices in KWD. When a customer shops in KWD, the checkout page shows all items KWD value, a total in KWD and then another line with the USD value total to be charged to your credit card, which is correct. p  pHowever, the 2Checkout receiving interface according to a screenshot their support sent me shows that KWD is being passed, not USD.p  pBase currency is set as USD, and the total to be bill shows up correctly as USD on the customer checkout screen however the numbers passed to 2Checkout in the background are in KWD for some reason and I end up with a PE 102 Errorp  pAny ideas Please note, Caching is set to off, and I have entered my currency conversion in Magento currency setup.p

Negative 760 pI had installed SSL certs one one of my cloud server by following thisp  pa hrefhttpwww.rackspace.comknowledgecenterarticleinstallingansslcertificateonapache relnofollowhttpwww.rackspace.comknowledgecenterarticleinstallingansslcertificateonapacheap  pI am running jetpack plugin on my wordpress blog. The jetpack plugin is not getting connected to wordpress. I have talked with the Jetpack support guys and they say thisp  pstrongSupport Replystrongp  pThe problem is that OpenSSL doesnt recognize your certificates Certificate Authoritys certificate. The that URL works in browsers is because most modern browsers allow for certificate discovery by reading the Authority Information Access metadata from the certificate, which contains a URL from which the browser can download the CAs certificate. OpenSSL does not.p  pThe best solution is if you can configure your webserver to supply the entire SSL certificate chain, rather than just your own certificate. Thats what we do on WordPress.com. Sending the entire chain will also make your sites more compatible with older and I believe some mobile browsers.p  pCan any one describe me how can I install or provide entire certificate chainp  pThanksp

Negative 760 pIm currently in the process of re launching my site which is primarily a site that is a giant Google Map with LOTS of markers Currently around 34,000 and estimated to be at 50,000 by the end of 2013 [calculated using average additions a day].p  pSince launch I have been improving my skills and optimising by using methods such as Gzip, removing unneeded data from the data file that the site uses and clustering the data.p  pThe development site can be viewed at a hrefhttpdev.rastrack.co.uk relnofollowhttpdev.rastrack.co.ukap  pWhat would I be able to do, to speed up the page load even more. From what I can tell the limitation is now where the client has to cluster all the markers. p  pI can host and write PHP code to do the job if this is possible.

Negative 760 pWill running multiple processes that all make HTTP requests be notably faster than onep  pIm parsing about a million urls using codelxml.html.parsecodep  pAt first, I ran a Python process that simply looped through the urls and called codelxml.html.parsemyUrlcode on each, and waited for the rest of the method to deal with the data before doing so again. This way, I was able to process on the order of code10000code urlshour.p  pI imagined that if I ran a few identical processes dealing with different sets of urls, I would speed up the rate at which I could fetch these urls. Surprisingly, to me at least, I measured about code10400code urlshour this time, which isnt notably better, considering Im sure both were fluctuating dramatically.p  pstrongMy question is why isnt running three of these processes much faster than onestrongp  pI know for a fact that my requests arent meaningfully affecting their target in any way, so I dont think its them. Do I not have enough bandwidth to make these extra processes worthwhile If not, how can I measure this Am I totally misunderstanding how my MacBook is running these processes Im assuming on different cores concurrent threads, or something roughly equivalent to that. Something else entirelyp  pApologies if I mangled any web terminology  Im new to this kind of stuff. Corrections are appreciated.p  pNote I imagine that running these processes on three different servers would probably be about 3x as fast.

Negative 760 pAs the title says, theres a a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.io.directory.move.aspx relnofollowDirectory.Movea but no codeDirectory.Copycode method in a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarySystem.IO.Directory.aspx relnofollowDirectorya class from System.IO. Is there a reason for thatp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pTo me, the copy and move actions are pretty much identical, the only difference being that the move action does a copy and then deletes the destination. And the error handling is as complex for move as it is for copy. So if one is implemented, why isnt the otherp  pstrongUpdate 2strongp  pThis is a quote from a comment from mmcleanp  blockquote   pDirectory.Move however does not emmoveem, it renames. Thus the   destination path is a full path to point to the directory, rather   than a location to move into, and moving to a different drive is   impossible.p blockquote  pSo I understand that emmoveem actually does a emrenameem operation only changes and entry in the File Allocation Table. But both move and copy commands have the same problem with merging items existing in the destination overwritekeep both. So the only added complexity for the copy operation is that it has to physically copy files around. But that still doesnt explain the decision to not implement it. Even more so, when the copy command is implemented in VB.NET and theres a pretty simple implementation for a copy operation on MSDN a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarybb762914.aspx relnofollowherea.p

Negative 760 pI created a windows service which watches a directory. When a file is dumped into it, it takes the data and puts it into a database. Then this file is moved to another directory and deleted. It works fine in debug mode. But when i install it on my computer it stops after throwing the data into the database and the file in question is neither moved or deleted. I suspect a permission issue is involved.

Negative 760 pVisual Studio, as of VS2010, supports the concept of a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combvcblogarchive20091208cnativemultitargeting.aspx relnofollowmultitargettinga, where a solution can be configured for, and built with, the compiler, libraries and includes of preceding Visual Studio versions. For example, the 2010 IDE can be used to build with the v90 2008 toolset in 2012 IDE can be used to build with v90, v100, v110 and v110xp toolchains, and so on.p  pThe question is this how to configure a CMake build system, already setup to generate solutions for Visual Studio N to build with the compiler etc of Visual Studio N, to permit building with Visual Studio NM from within the IDE.p  pWhile toolset selection should work merely by T toolset, the issue is that this then in turn provokes a failure in cmake2.8ModulesCMakeTestCXXCompiler.cmake , claiming that the cl.exe is not able to compile a simple program. This is not the case, however, in selecting a toolset within a Visual Studio version e.g. v110xp in Visual Studio 2012. There seems to be some complication in toolsets across Visual Studio versions, as opposed to toolsets within Visual Studio versions.p  pDoes anyone have concrete experience of CMake in this usecase, in generating solutions for toolsets from preceding versions for use in the IDE of the current version of Visual Studiop

Would f work for a stringp  pI tried doing this, but for some reason, my compiler does not read the condition and skips it. Also, I know printf works for double. so if I cast the double by an unsignedint, I can convert a float to a hexadecimal if I do thisp  precodefloat f printfEnter float scanff, ampf printfhex is x, unsigned intampf codepre  pThis works perfectly fine. p  pIn the program I have to write it says my program has to produce an error if hexadecimal arguments are out of range.As in too many hexadecimal digits. But what is that normally supposed to mean Based on what The IEEE 754 format  32 bit numberp  pThanks.p

Negative 760 pI am trying to populate a 2D array in java and need help to make an array appear in a JFrame window for a Game of Life project.p  pIve been given a class that includes a constructor called LifeWindow, a method called drawWorld supposed to redraw the cell display , and another one called displayLife which pauses the animation.p  pThe LifeWindow constructor takes a 2d array as a parameter and uses JFrame to build a window.p  pMy code in main isp  precodepublic class GameOfLife   public static void mainString[] args  int[][] myArray  new int[100][100]  LifeWindow game  new LifeWindowmyArray, 5      forint i  0 i lt myArray.length i         forint j  0 i lt myArray.length j              myArray[i][j]  intMath.random  10                 codepre  pSo, I have declared an array before passing it to the constructor that was provided to me.

Negative 760 pIm trying out the Direct2D RenderTarget property of C Builders TDirect2DCanvas to benchmark bitmap manipulation using the GPU. This is most impressive compared to GDI. However, I cannot figure out how to get the result back into CPU memory so I can use it for further CPU processing. Did read about using WIC but apparently you loose most of the hardware acceleration. Windows 8 seem to offer a new bitmap with map functionality, but I want to use standard Windows 7. Also C Builder does not offer the header files for these new functions.p  pGiven a TDirect2DCanvas, or so you wish a Direct2D RenderTarget or a ID2D1Bitmap, how do I copy the bitmap back to CPU memoryp

Negative 760 pI have an Oracle DB sequence that is being called by the following JPA.  The problem is that the sequence that is being returned is not the same sequence number that the database is actually using.  The JPA component is usually one less than the actual id  for the record that is inserted into the table.  For instance, when debugging JPA states that the objects Id will be 3689711 but after the record is persisted, the actual record in the table is 3689712, but it isnt always so recognizable.  Once the record is created, I need to obtain the correct ID so that I can pass it to another process, but without the correct number, the next process fails.p  precodeId SequenceGeneratornameSDRLEARNINGACTIVITYTRANSCRIPT, allocationSize1 GeneratedValuestrategyGenerationType.SEQUENCE,generatorSDRLEARNINGACTIVITYTRANSCRIPT Basicoptional  false NotNull Columnname  ID private Long id codepre  p1 I have the following DDL for my Oracle sequencep  precodeCREATE SEQUENCE  SDRLEARNINGACTIVITYTRANSCRIPT   MINVALUE 1 MAXVALUE 999999999999999999999999999  INCREMENT BY 1 START WITH 3690531 CACHE 20 NOORDER  NOCYCLE  codepre  pI know I could work around this and add a temporary value to another field and then do a look up on a temporary value to get the real value of the PK after the record is persisted, but this seems like a lot of extra DB calls for something this basic.  Any help would be appreciated.p  p2 It appears that JPA simply queries the nextVal from the sequence but has no way of locking that in to the DB prior to the actual commit.  Since it executes the sequence to determine the next value that forces the sequence to automatically generate a new nextVal.  Im not sure that it matters, but my sequence is triggered before the record inserts into the table.  So, when JPA finally commits the record, the underlying database triggersequence actually generates a new sequence value meaning the original sequence number JPA claimed to have is actually overwritten by the underlying database when it calls the sequence again.  So, the only solution that seems to make sense is to modify the underlying database trigger to not generate a sequence if the column already has a value, but that seems risky.  The sequence generation within JPA seems flawed at best if you need to take advantage of the sequence number for other processes.p

Negative 760 pstrongEdit Clarificationstrong convert any valid number encoding from a string to a numberp  pHow does one convert a string to a number, say just for integers, for all accepted integer formats, particularly the ones that throw NumberFormatException under Integer.parseInt.

We can assume that we already know that the encoding is a valid number, say by checking it against a regex.

Using the input, I create an array of the spectrum where I look for the highest value and use that frequency as the one to feed into the tuner.  The problem is that when creating an analyser in Web Audio it can not become more specific than an FFT value of 2048.  When using this if i play a 440hz note, the closest note in the array is something like 430hz and the next value seems to be higher than 440.  Therefor the tuner will think I am playing these notes when infact the loudest frequency should be 440hz and not 430hz.  Since this frequency does not exist in the analyser array I am trying to figure out a way around this or if I am missing something very obvious.p  pI am very new at this so any help would be very appreciated.p  pThanksp
Negative 760 pI have created a data warehouse with numerous fact and dimension tables.  For each of the fact tables, I am trying to create a clustered columnstore index, but I keep running into an issue. I use the following statement to try and accomplish this.p  pCREATE CLUSTERED COLUMNSTORE INDEX CStoreIXFactAssessment ON FactAssessmentp  pFor some reason, it keeps highlighting the word CREATE and gives the message SQL70001 This statement is not recognized in this context.  I have made sure that I downloaded the latest version of SSDT from the TOOLSExtensions and Updates menu, but still have the problem.  I am trying to keep all of my database code such as my creation of indexes, constraints, etc. in this one solution rather than moving to management studio to add them.  Has anyone else come across this problem or does anyone have any ideas what I may be doing wrong  Any help is appreciatedp
Negative 760 pI have different kinds of elements  textboxes, selects, checkboxes and radio buttons on my view. When I present this strongly typed view with the model there are some elements that get populated with corresponding model values but there are certain kinds and ones that dont. Radio buttons, checkboxes are blank. When it comes to select elements, if they are created with codeHtml.DropDownListForcode helper method then they get correct values, but if they are just plain Html selects with their names corresponding to model properties then the default first item is selected. Ive created both checkboxes and radiobuttons with Html helper methodsp  precode              Html.RadioButtonForx gt x.PreferredReplyMethod, PreferredReplyMethod.Written.GetHashCode, new  id  rbReplyWritten              ltlabel forrbReplyWrittengtWrittenltlabelgt             Html.RadioButtonForx gt x.PreferredReplyMethod, PreferredReplyMethod.Verbal.GetHashCode, new  id  rbReplyVerbal              ltlabel forrbReplyVerbalgtVerballtlabelgt           Html.CheckBoxForx gt x.IsUnderControl, new  id  chkUnderControl           Html.LabelForx gt x.IsUnderControl, new  for  chkUnderControl  codepre  pThe thing is, if I post these values to back to the server, all the saved values are correct.

Negative 760 pI have a MsgBox that displays both OK and Help buttons. I would like to redirect to a website when Help button is clicked, but Im completely unable to achieve it. I have read in some forums that the easiest way to get it is to make your own userform and to assign a subroutine to each button attached. Another possible way that Ive found is to create a .hlp file, call it from the Help File parameter and place the proper context ID, but I need to store the help file in a website, and, anyway, I cant find the context IDs numbers.

However, as soon as I accidentally chose a different data source than localhost for the client application, the problem popped back up again.

I went over and over this with a friend, and we couldnt find the problem.  Please helpp  pemEDITem To be clear, I do know that Accept is a blocking call.  The client program makes the connection on port 10000, but this program keeps on waiting on the Accept as if nothing happened.  It did work for a time, so I know the connection is working like it is supposed to from the client programs end.  However, I cant fathom why this program is now acting like that connection never happens, and continues to wait on the Accept.p

Negative 760 pI am looking for a solution for the database of my project.p  pWe have a database of around 70 tables and out of them there are 57 tables which have more than 30 million rows each.p  pOne of these huge table is a parent table and it has NVARCHAR primary key column being referred by other tables. Scenario looks as following.p  precodeTable1  Id NVARCHAR PK 30 M Rows  Table2  Id NVARCHAR PK Referring Table1.Id 30 M Rows  Table3  Id NVARCHAR PK Referring Table1.Id 30 M Rows  Table4  Id NVARCHAR PK Referring Table1.Id 30 M Rows  Table5  Id NVARCHAR Referring Table1.Id 30 M Rows codepre  pAnd there are some more tables referring Table1.Id probably having less rows but not less than 100,000.p  pThe situation, for security, reasons we need to generate new values for Table1.Id and Update them.p  pI am thinking of making FK References Update Cascade so that when Update statement runs on Table1 values in all related tables will be updated automatically. p  pBut I am not sure what will be the performance impact. If it slows down the database and eventually the application in production it will not be acceptable at all.p  pSo I need a guidance here about the performance impact of update cascade in such huge tables also it will be great if someone can suggest a better way to achieve this.p

Negative 760 pOur parallel Fortran program is running more than twice slower after updating the OS to Ubuntu 14.04 and rebuilding Gfortran 4.8.2. To measure which parts of the code were slowed down is unfortunately not possible any more not without downgrading the OS since I did not save any profiling information for gprof when compiling under the old OS. Because the program does lots of matrix inversions, my guess is that one library LAPACK or programming interface openMP has been updated between Ubuntu 12 and 14 in a way that slows down everything. I believe this is a general problem which could be already known to somebody here. Which is the solution to get back to a fast Fortran code, besides downgrading back to Ubuntu 12 or 13p  pPS All libraries were installed from the repositories with apgget and thus,they should have be also upgraded when I upgraded the system with aptget distupgrade, I could, however, check if they are indeed the latest versions andor build them from scratch.p  pPS2 Thanks a lot for the suggestions. I followed Steaberts advice and profiled the present code I recompiled with gfortran pg and checked the performance with gprof. The program was suspiciously slow when calling some old F77 subroutines, which I translated to f90 without performance improvement. I played with the suggested flags and compared the time of one program iteration Flags fnoaggressiveloopoptimizations, llapack and lblas did not yield any significant performance improvement. Flags latlas, llapacklatlas and lf77blas do not let to compile usrbinld cannot find lf77blas, etc, even though the libraries exist and are in the right path. Both the compiler flags playing and performance analysis suggest that my first guess the slowing down being related to matrix inversions, lapack, etc was wrong. It rather seems that the slowing down is in a part of the code where no heavy linear algebra is performed. Using objdump myexec s I have found out that my program was originally compiled with gfortran 4.6.3 before the OS upgrade. Instead of using the present gfortran 4.8.2. I could try now to compile the code with the old compiler.p

Negative 760 pI have an assignment with loops that I need help on. It is really quite simple but I dont know how to use loops. I need to print out three shapes using loops. The shapes are made of asterisks, but Im only allowed to print one asterisk at a time, so I must loops to print the shapes. The first shape is a just 10 asterisks in a row one after another. The second one is just ten lines with one asterisk on each line. The last one is the hardest one. It is a shape that has ten lines. And the first line has one asterisk, the second line has two, the third one has three so on and so forth, then the tenth line has ten asterisks.

Negative 760 pI have a dataset where we record the electrical power demand from each individual appliance in the home.  The dataset is quite large 2 years or data 1 sample every 6 seconds 50 appliances.  The data is in a compressed HDF file.p  pWe need to add the power demand for every appliance to get the total aggregate power demand over time.  Each individual meter might have a different start and end time.p  pThe naive approach using a simple model of our data is to do something like thisp  precodeLENGHT  225 N  30 cumulator  pd.Series  for i in rangeN      change the index for each newentry to mimick the fact      that out appliance meters have different start and end time.     newentry  pd.Series1, indexnp.arangei, LENGTHi     cumulator  cumulator.addnewentry, fillvalue0 codepre  pThis works fine for small amounts of data.  It also works OK with large amounts of data emas long asem every newentry has exactly the same index.p  pBut, with large amounts of data, where each newentry has a different start and end index, Python quickly gobbles up all the available RAM.  I suspect this is a memory fragmentation issue.  If I use codemultiprocessingcode to fire up a new process for each meter to load the meters data from disk, load the cumulator from disk, do the addition in memory, then save the cumulator back to disk, and exit the process then we have fine memory behaviour but, of course, all that disk IO slows us down a lot.p  pSo, I think what I want is an inplace Pandas codeaddcode function.  The plan would be to initialise codecumulatorcode to have an index which is the union of all the meters indicies.  Then allocate memory emonceem for that cumulator.  Hence no more fragmentation issues.p  pI have tried two approaches but neither is satisfactory.  p  pI tried using codenumpy.addcode to allow me to set the codeoutcode argumentp  precode Allocate enough space for the cumulator cumulator  pd.Series0, indexnp.arange0, LENGTHN  for i in rangeN     newentry  pd.Series1, indexnp.arangei, LENGTHi     cumulator, alignednewentry  cumulator.alignnewentry, copyFalse, fillvalue0     del newentry     np.addcumulator.values, alignednewentry.values, outcumulator.values     del alignednewentry codepre  pBut this gobbles up all my RAM too and doesnt seem to do the addition.  If I change the penaultiate line to codecumulator.values  np.addcumulator.values, alignednewentry.values, outcumulator.valuescode then I get an error about not being able to assign to codecumulator.valuescode.p  pThis second approach appears to have the correct memory behaviour but is emfarem too slow to runp  precodefor i in rangeN     newentry  pd.Series1, indexnp.arangei, LENGTHi     for index in cumulator.index         try             cumulator[index]  newentry[index]         except KeyError             pass codepre  pI suppose I could write this function in Cython.

Negative 760 pAt the moment, I have a system which creates a word document based offve database entries and a word template. This all works fine, and I used to  add a page break at the end of the document usingp  precodeMainDocumentPart mainPart  wordDoc.MainDocumentPart var newbreak  new Break  Type  BreakValues.Page  Paragraph para  new Paragraphnew Runnewbreak mainPart.Document.Body.InsertAfterpara, mainPart.Document.Body.LastChild codepre  pThis is only done when multiple documents are being requested at once, as they are all added to the same Word docx. This worked fine up until recently, when I was requested to make this print double sided. Some of the documents requested were 3 pages long meaning that it messed them all up. The best way to counter this would be to force word to leave a blank page if the current document ends on an odd page, meaning i need an Odd SECTION break.p  pI cant seem to find anything helpful on how to implement this, and Im not too familiar with OpenXML so any help would be appreciated.p  pI need some code that slots exactly where the above code is, as it is in a function that is ONLY CALLED if multiple documents have been requested they arent needed for single documentsp  pThankyou in advance.p

Negative 760 pI want to write a robust bash script and I use codeset ecode to make sure the script will stop running whenever something goes wrong.  It works great but there is still one hole conditions.   If I write codeif f then .... ficode and function codefcode fails on executing some command, the script will not be terminated.  Therefore I need to check return code of every command in codefcode, as well as in all the subroutines codefcode invoke, recursively.  This is annoying.p  pIs there something, e.g. some flag or option in bash, that makes it fail even inside a condition.  The only exception is codereturncode statement directly inside codefcode.  If codefcode calls codegcode and codegcode returns 1, then it is still considered as error, with the exception that codegcode is also called as condition, i.e. codeif g then ... ficode, then codereturncode statement inside codegcode is allowed.  So on so forth.p

See screenshot below.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comEv2SF.jpg altenter image description herep  pWhat Id like to have happen is have the each drive only account for 1 row, and each promotional item listed in a new column to the right.

Negative 760 pI really had a bad experience today. I applied some batch SQL scripts through Netbeans IDE to my H2 database which is running in TCP mode.

Subsequently I restarted the server on which the H2 database is running and then I realized that all changes of the last 5 hours were not applied or somehow rolled back...p  pMy conclusion is, that the changes were only in the cache and not flushed to the database, since the results were at any one time visible when queried after each SQL script.p  pTherefore, what happens to the database cache in the case of a system failure  Gone ... p

Negative 760 pMy activities extend from a generic base activity, where I declare and initialize public variables like codecontextcode of type Context, codeactivitycode of type Activity and mActionBar of type codeActionBarcode.p  pSo this avoids redundant initialization code in all my apps activities.p  pBut with the advent of codeToolbarcode, I am a little confused on how to do this. Toolbar is not like ActionBar and replaces it, but also extends it.p  pThe ActionBar is a view object that is always available for retrieval, by ActionBar activity, and it sits above the views that are created. This is not declared in layout XML anywhere.p  pBut Toolbar is declared only in layout XML, so I have to include it in each and every layout I create, or else I will not be able to access the Toolbar object.p  pI typically use codesetContentViewR.layout.mylayoutcode in the codeonCreatecode method of each individual activity. And then I have to initialize my Toolbar object after that using codefindViewByIdcode. Therefore I cant put this code in my BaseActivitys onCreate function because the codesetContentViewcode wouldnt have been initialized yet.p  pEven if I created Toolbar programmatically with its constructor, and attempted to add the view to the top of the hierarchy, I would still have to do this on a layout by layout, and activity by activity basis, because some layouts are RelativeLayouts as the root object, and others are different. So these will still have separate code considerations.p  pThe reason I am curious about a good way for my activities to inherit Toolbar, is because it is a complete nightmare for Google to suddenly require Android 4.04.4 devices to use the v7 compatibility pack, replace the actionbar completely with the Toolbar object, use v4 compatibility pack fragments instead of native ones, all to use the latest design paradigms.p
Negative 760 pi was working on an application and dropcreating the database on each launch. Now, before going into production, i enabled migrations. I created an initial migration, then changed one of my models, added a new migration, updated the database, and everything was dandy p  pnow, I tried to change the database name in the context, to see how it would behave on a new database, and every time I launch the application I get a differed exception. p  pright now its codeinvalid object namecode.. on one of my tables i think. Im looking at answers here and they say to refresh the intellisense cache but I cant find where. I went to edit  intellisense  theres no refresh cache, theres refresh remote resources, which didnt fix anything.p  pby the way, do I have to turn automatic migrations on i.e. truep

Facebook is a great example of a library that even if you wanted to compile it through Gradle you couldnt because they dont support it, and you need to run it as a local library  it seems like youll then receive this unnecessary module dependency warning for every class that doesnt directly call Facebook. p  pSo, the question is  what is the proper way of handling this error Do I ignore it or am I supposed to change the code in some way to make it disappearp  pEdit in the preferences menu for Lint it describes the check as follows in case this helps figure it outp  precodeThis inspection lists modules which contain redundant dependencies on other modules.

Negative 760 pHas anyone out in the community successfully created a Selenium build in Jenkins using Browserstack as their cloud provider, while requiring a local testing connection behind a firewallp  pI can say for sure Saucelabs is surprisingly easy to execute builds with the Sauce Jenkins plugin in a continuous deployment environment as I have done it. I cannot however, say the same for Browserstack. The organization I work with currently uses Browserstack, and although their service does support automated testing using a binary application I find it troublesome with Jenkins. I need to make absolutely sure Browserstack is not a viable solution, if so. I love Saucelabs and what their organization provides, but if Browserstack works I dont want to switch if I dont need to.p  pThe Browserstack documentation instructs you to run a command, with some available options, in order to create a local connection before execution.p  precodenohup .[binary file] localIdentifier [id] [auth key] localhost,3000,0 amp codepre  pI have added the above statement as a prebuild step shell command. I have to also add nohup as once the binary creates a successful connection, the build never actually starts since I have not exited as displayed in the output below.p  blockquote   pBrowserStackLocal v3.5p      pYou can now access your local servers in our remote browser.p      pPress CtrlC to exitp blockquote  pNormally I can successfully execute the first build without a problem. Subsequent build configurations using the same command never connect. The above message displays, but during test execution Browserstack reports no local testing connection was established. This confuses me.p  pTo give you a better idea of whats being executed, I have 15 build configurations for various projects suites and browser combinations. Two Jenkins executors exist and I have more than 5 Browserstack VMs available at any given time. Five of the builds will automatically begin execution when the associated project code is pushed to the staging server, filling up both executors. One of them will begins and end fine. None of the others will as Browserstack reports local testing is not available.p  pSaucelabs obviously has this figured out with their plugin, which is great. If Browserstack requires shell commands to create local testing connections, I must be doing something wrong, out of order, etc.p  pEnvironmentp  ul liJava 7li liSelenium 2.45li liJUnit 4.11li liMaven 3.1.1li liAllure 1.4.10li liJenkins 1.5li ul  pCan someone post some information who use Browserstack in a continuous testing environment while utilizing multiple parallel test executions and tell me how each build is configuredp  pThanks,p

Negative 760 pIs it possible to disable an activity elements when it loads a fragments I have a program which has an activity and two fragments. I put a container in activity.

Negative 760 pI am loading an obj file using glmReadOBJ. I then iterate through the vertices to get the min and max height, width and depth to finally get the center of the model. Finally, I alter every vertex using a scale to center my object in the window. I have also calculate the normal of each face by computing the cross product and normalizing the vector. However, I am not sure how exactly to assign that vector to modelfacetnorms. That is a GLfloat pointer. I also need to calculate the normal for every vextex, normalize and assign it to the model object. I am assuming it is modelnormals. I have some examples using already built in functions but the instructions of the assignments state not to use those. The reason is so that we get a better understanding. The models display very distorted.p  precodemodel  glmReadOBJfilename for every triangle     get vertices     find min and max X,Y,Z     compute triangle normal using cross product and normalizing     here i dont know how to assign normal to object  use the min and max values to find the center of model and scale around that point codepre  pa hrefhttppostimg.orgimage93sdjq78x relnofollowimageap

Negative 760 pI have a class called LineUp, it is an ArrayList of a class called Event.

Event e1  new EventFoo Fighters, northstage, 1 LineUp is an ArrayList, Event being elements like e1. p  pIn my LineUp class I have to make an invariant that checks that every Event contained within the ArrayList lineup has a unique Venue and Session.

Negative 760 pIm working on an university project, I have to find and existing Java code that allows doing number recognition on a picture of a soccer tshirt. The title is more general because the problem can be seen as number recognition, text recognition or finding a picture in a picture. I need a program that given an input image squares number in a minimum inclusion square like OpenCV allows doing with faces and if possible tells user if the number was found or not.p  pI tried using tesseract, aspose and many codes posted in this site, sourceforge and similar but no one was usefull. I think the easiest way is using OpenCV, maybe using a classifier or a neural network but Im really new in this. Can someone help me linking me an implementation of my problem or in some other way Thank you and sorry for my terrible English p

Negative 760 pI apologize for the horrible title. I could not think of anything better. I will do my best in explaining my question here.p  pI have existing REST api endpoints which work with clear ID fields, like taskId, userId, profileId, etc. I am writing angularjs based frontend, which will call these existing api endpoints to getpost data. e.g. Once a user logins, an api endpoint which is used to validation login information, returns an userId unique identifier of the loggedin user in response. Next, the userId which came with last calls response is used to fetch the list of tasks each identified uniquely by a taskId associated with that user. And futrther, the taskId is used to fetch task details. p  pIn all the above communication, IDs  userId, taskId are on client side in the clear. I want to implement a solution where without changing my apis, i can replace my clear IDs with encrypted tokensp  ol liUser logins with usernamepassword. API returns a User object with userId and all other IDs in that object encrypted. So, there is a response transformer which encrypts all the predefined ID fields before response is sent back to the clientli liNow, frontend component will use the encrypted id for all further calls. It calls api like myapitasksuserencrypteduserid to get tasks for the user. li liThere is a filter on the server, which intercepts all the api requests and decrypts all the predefined ID fields before passing the request to the real api method.li ol  pstrongMy questionsstrongp  ol liIs there an open source apiframework available, which i can leverage to implement this solution li liIs there a differentbetter way to achieve the same goals what i am trying to achieve with this solution li liAny reference implementation i can refer to for implementing my request interceptor and response transformer, which encryptsdecrypts the predefined ID fields depending upon the object being transmittedli ol  pAny inputssuggestionscomments are most welcome and appreciated.

Negative 760 pCurrently there are 2030 solutions with 1 project, each in a different directory. I can build and run the project in each solution independently.p  pI am trying to create a global unit test, one button which verifies that there are no issues in any of the projects. The first step is to quickly compile all of the projects at once. Each project generates similar output, so its trivial to pipe the executable output to a text file and build a tool to verify it.p  pIve been looking atp  p1 Possibly creating a keyboardmouse macro. The main issue is that it would have no way of knowing when compilation was finished in order to start the next compilation.p  p2 Possibly making a bash script to compile the files using one of the executables in Program FilesMicrosoft Visual Studio 10.0VCbin and the compile switches I can find by right clicking the project, going Properties, and going to the CCCommand Line tab on the left. I cant figure out how these executables are called by Visual C. If I could figure out how to compile one, I could probably figure out how to compile them all.p  p3 Somehow creating a solution with all the projects from the different directories. I think that would allow me to do a global build of all projects. To do this, Ive triedp  pa Trying to find a Create New Solution tool.p  pb Using the FileNewProject From Existing Code... tool, then selecting the folder. It doesnt ask for the project file.

These are simple projects which output text to the console. Ive selected Console application project and moved on. I dont understand why I need to fill in the preprocessor definitions over again and the include search paths. The other options I dont know what they mean. I left it all blank. Now it says Project name is invalid. A file or folder already exists with the same path. Which of course it does  thats the project I want to add to this solution.p  pc I did the above and changed the project name to unitTest. If I try to build it, it fails to open any of the include files.p  pI think Im going about this wrong.

Negative 760 pMy problem is related to JADE and Java. Basically the problem is may be of classpath but Im not able to figure it out. While shifting my code from localhost to server I have added all my jar files into proper folder and added classpath for the jar files. My work is in jade i.e. java agent development environment. My codes are working fine on the localhost. But when I run the same code on the server I am getting following error. I have added the same jar files and same version of JDK for execution both on localhost and on server. So I guess there is no any problem of version. Whereas at the same time some part of the agent executed successfully which also need jar to run that shows there is no problem of classpath.p  precode  Uncaught Exception for agent defaultshopRecom        java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError orgapachehttpclientClientProtocolException     at situationAsses.SituationAsses.ltinitgtSituationAsses.java27     at myProject.defaultshopRecom1.onTickdefaultshopRecom.java81     at jade.core.behaviours.TickerBehaviour.actionTickerBehaviour.java72     at jade.core.behaviours.Behaviour.actionWrapperBehaviour.java344     at jade.core.AgentActiveLifeCycle.executeAgent.java1532     at jade.core.Agent.runAgent.java1471     at java.lang.Thread.runThread.java701 Caused by java.lang.ClassNotFoundException org.apache.http.client.ClientProtocolException     at java.net.URLClassLoader1.runURLClassLoader.java217     at java.security.AccessController.doPrivilegedNative Method     at java.net.URLClassLoader.findClassURLClassLoader.java205     at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClassClassLoader.java323     at sun.misc.LauncherAppClassLoader.loadClassLauncher.java294     at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClassClassLoader.java268     ... 7 more codepre

Negative 760 pIf I use a pattern like codedMyycode for creating a Java 8 DateTimeFormatter e.g. using codeDateTimeFormatter.ofPatternpatterncode which I will only use for parsing, not formatting, it will interpret all twoletter years as 20xx, e.g. parsing a string like code13599code to be interpreted as code20990513code, which in my case is wrong it was meant to be in the year 1999.p  pIn my application, Im trying to parse dates from OCRd documents, which could e.g. still be from the 90ies, so having the old SimpleDateFormat behavior of interpreting the date to be within 80 years before and 20 years after the current date fits me quite well. But for various reasons Im still looking to switch the whole date parsing logic to the new Java 8 DateTimeFormatters.p  pLooking through the Java source code, I see that this is all interpreted relative to the constant codeReducedPrinterParser.BASEDATEcode, but I see no way to change the value used when building my own formatter from a pattern. Is this simply not possible or have I missed some possibility of specifying the behavior for parsing twoletter yearsp

Negative 760 pI have an interesting problem going on.  I recently moved 2 SQL databases to SQL Azure for a client and all seemed to be going well...at first.  Midmorning I get a spike of error emails for various things, but a few common onesp  pThe request limit for the database is 90 and has been reached.br Timeout expired. The timeout period elapsed prior to completion of the operation or the server is not responding.br A transportlevel error has occurred when receiving results from the server.p  pTheres obviously some database related issues going on with the move to Azure, or the existing code in general.  The errors that seemed to happen the most were request limit and timeouts. Once they started, they never seemed to stop.  And I dont think there were many users using the site today.  It almost seemed like the connection continued to try to connect on a different thread in the background if this makes any sense. This is in reference to the The timeout period elapsed prior to completion of the operation or the server is not responding.  I would get an error email, Id check the page it referenced myself, and it would load immediately.  I checked with the user who threw the error and they reported everything was fine.  Strange.  Yet I continued every few minutes to get the same error email.p  pI currently have them on the S1 Tier which limits the requests to 90 concurrently.  I did some digging and found the following SQL queryp  precodeselect  from sys.dmexecconnections codepre  pI ran this, and it showed I had over 90 active connections, some of which were opened some time ago.  This was strange to me as the site was currently not being used its really late at night and I know no one is using the site.  I wanted to end all the connections so I came up with the following queryp  precodeDECLARE sessionId int DECLARE SQL nvarchar1000 DECLARE clientIP nvarchar50  set clientIP  XX.XX.XX.XX  select sessionId  min sessionid  from sys.dmexecconnections where   clientnetaddress  clientIP  while sessionId is not null begin     SET SQL  KILL   CASTsessionId as varchar4     EXEC SQL     select sessionId  min sessionid  from sys.dmexecconnections where sessionid gt sessionId and clientnetaddress  clientIP end codepre  pI tried running this command, but the connections came right back.  I went on the web server and manually stopped the site in IIS, ran the KILL command again but the connections remained.  I put up the appoffline file and took the site down for about a half hour to see if any lingering connections would drop, but they didnt.  And I still continued to get error emails for pages I KNEW were not accessible because I stopped the Site AND app pool.  I went on the server and manually stopped the w3wp process and ran SQL KILL statements to kill the connections.  They finally went away I put the app back online and hit a single page.  I kept running the above query to see the active connections and sure enough every time I ran the query the active connection count kept creeping up.  It stops around 102 as of right now.  And thats me as a user hitting a single page.  Im guessing this isnt normal  Does this indicate connections are lingering out there and not being dropped or closedp  pI just made code changes recently adding Entity Framework.  Wherever Im grabbing data through EF, im using so with a using statement on the context.  The rest of the app is sort of old and is using TableAdapters.  I see in some places its following the same pattern with using statements, other places Dispose is being called.  I havent had a chance to track down all the usages yet.  Is this a good place to start looking   Anyone have any suggestions on how to track this leak down  Im not super knowledgeable with SQL so any help would be greatly appreciatedp
