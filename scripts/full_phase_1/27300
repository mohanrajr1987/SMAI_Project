Positive 27300 pIll be honest not sure if this is the best stack exchange question as it is board but here we go.p  pIm in school for computer science and I just started a class using JavaEE. No one seems to be able to give me a straight answer. From what we have developed so far in our little labs it seems like we are creating web pages that have very nice userinterfaces p  pMy text book Core JavaServer Faces By David Geary amp Cay Horstmann states in the intro you can think of it as a Swing for serverside applications. I have seen how this can relate because our web pages have been able to store input like with php. For example if my user inputs a name and password Im able to remember them. p

Positive 27300 pIm very new to J2EE, so apologies if this is obvious.  I have to work around a bad database design, which has an update which cannot be done safely in parallel.  The easiest way to fix this for now is to place a mutex protection around the method call to serialize its access.p  pI understand that you cant safely just use the synchronised keyword on the method in J2EE as the container may interfere.  Is there a supported way in J2EE to make a mutexsemaphorelock in an EJB to ensure access to a method is serialised  for the entire J2EE applicationp
Positive 27300 pIm currently struggling with getting remote EJB invocation to work on wildfly 8.x and 9.x. p  pIn detail its about remote invocation from a standalone client application not from another app server using the EJB Client API approach. The remote naming approach works for me but isnt applicable in my scenario because I need to use clientside interceptors for passing context data to a serverside interceptor for the remote invocations.p  pBut for now I try to get remote invocations with the client API to work for a simple example. Therefore I tried the quickstart for remote ejb invocation which is available on github a hrefhttpsgithub.comwildflyquickstarttree9.xejbremote relnofollowwildflyquickstartejbremotea. The point is that this quickstart raises the same error as my on simple sample app. Here are some details of my applicationp  pstrongMy remote interfacestrongp  precodepackage test.ejb  public interface HelloRemote    String greetString name  codepre  pstrongMy Bean implementationstrongp  precodepackage test.ejb import javax.ejb.Remote import javax.ejb.Stateless  Statelessname  Hello RemoteHelloRemote.class public class HelloBean implements HelloRemote     public String greetString name      return Hello   name     codepre  pThe remote view of the bean is correctly registered at the server in export namespacep  precodejavajbossexportedejbtestbackend.jarHellode.coryx.HelloRemote codepre  hr  pHere now the client sidep  pstrongMy Main classstrongp  precodeimport java.util.Properties import javax.naming.Context import javax.naming.InitialContext import javax.naming.NamingException import org.jboss.ejb.client.EJBClientContext import test.ejb.HelloRemote  public class Main    public static void mainString[] args throws Exception      Properties props  new Properties     props.putContext.URLPKGPREFIXES, org.jboss.ejb.client.naming     Context context  new InitialContextprops      String jndiLookup  ejbejbtestbackend.jarHello  HelloRemote.class.getName     HelloRemote hello  HelloRemote context.lookupjndiLookup     System.out.printlnhello.greetWorld     codepre  pstrongThe jbossejbclient.properties packaged in jarMETAINFstrongp  precodeendpoint.nameclientendpoint remote.connectionprovider.create.options.org.xnio.Options.SSLENABLEDfalse  remote.connectionsdefault remote.connection.default.hostlocalhost remote.connection.default.port8080 remote.connection.default.connect.options.org.xnio.Options.SASLPOLICYNOANONYMOUSfalse codepre  pWhen I execute the main Method I get the following error message same thing occurs when trying the wildfly quickstart that I mentioned abovep  precodeException in thread main java.lang.IllegalStateException EJBCLIENT000025 No EJB receiver available for handling [appName, moduleNameejbtestbackend.jar, distinctName] combination for invocation context org.jboss.ejb.client.EJBClientInvocationContext497470ed     at org.jboss.ejb.client.EJBClientContext.requireEJBReceiverEJBClientContext.java774     at org.jboss.ejb.client.ReceiverInterceptor.handleInvocationReceiverInterceptor.java116     at org.jboss.ejb.client.EJBClientInvocationContext.sendRequestEJBClientInvocationContext.java186     at org.jboss.ejb.client.EJBInvocationHandler.sendRequestWithPossibleRetriesEJBInvocationHandler.java255     at org.jboss.ejb.client.EJBInvocationHandler.doInvokeEJBInvocationHandler.java200     at org.jboss.ejb.client.EJBInvocationHandler.doInvokeEJBInvocationHandler.java183     at org.jboss.ejb.client.EJBInvocationHandler.invokeEJBInvocationHandler.java146     at com.sun.proxy.Proxy0.greetUnknown Source     at Main.mainMain.java16 codepre  pstrongWhen I use the remote naming approach everything is finestrongp  precodeProperties props  new Properties props.putContext.INITIALCONTEXTFACTORY, org.jboss.naming.remote.client.InitialContextFactory props.putContext.PROVIDERURL, httpremoting127.0.0.18080 props.putjboss.naming.client.ejb.context, true props.putContext.URLPKGPREFIXES, org.jboss.ejb.client.naming props.putjboss.naming.client.connect.options.org.xnio.Options.SASLPOLICYNOPLAINTEXT, false Context context  new InitialContextprops  String jndiLookup  ejbtestbackend.jarHello  HelloRemote.class.getName HelloRemote hello  HelloRemote context.lookupjndiLookup System.out.printlnhello.greetWorld codepre  pstrongOutput here is as expectedstrongp  precodeHello World codepre  pSo is there anyone who knows what could be wrong here or better, who has a working example for remote EJB invocation on Wildfly using the EJB client API Thanks in advancep

Positive 27300 pI had a look around for a Java solution to logging REST or HTTP calls in general in a Java EE environment to a database for later analysis but I havent been successful so far.p  pMy requirements are logging the request and response of course, including some meta data like the ip of the requesting side clientserver, the currently authenticated user and the status code. This should happen in way that you could search for this meta data in a efficient way so that there is not much stress on the database and you could build a log browser on top of it which can present you with results without being unresponsive even if there were several million log entries.p  pA nice to have would be that the log viewer is already there and does not have to be built.p  pDo I have to implement this myself or is there any solution that I could throw inp

Positive 27300 pI studied that Tomcat is a web server and a servlet container which ofcourse could not support the applications of full JEE i.e for example applications with EJB and so.p  precode   But I heard that Tomcat 8 has new features that support EJB applications also. I would like to know if it is true or not. Is it possible to deploy EJB applications in tomcat version 8     If so, from which version of tomcat, are EJB applications being supported And if tomcat also supports EJB applications then what advantages does JBoss or WildFly have over Tomcat versions that support EJB     Could anyone please suggest with proper reply Thanks in advance. codepre

Positive 27300 pI want to implement JAXWS API in an existing Web application which runs only in Tomcat and uses servlet. I dont have any knowledge on JAXWS. As I worried about web application portability from tomcat to other servers, I am preferring to implement JAXWS as standard alone application in tomcat. Whats the better way of doing it, implementing JAXWS on Java EE container or like standalone application in Tomcat. Is there any better way of doing it... And also I would like to know pros and cons implementing JAXWS in container VS standalone application. And also suggest me Best JAXWS implementation framework.p

Positive 27300 pFirst let me provide some backgroundp  pLately Ive been playing around with Samaxes approach on a hrefhttpsamaxes.com201404jaxrsbeanvalidationjavaee7wildfly relnofollow titleValidating JAXRS resource data with Bean Validation in Java EE 7 and WildFlyValidating JAXRS resource data with Bean Validation in Java EE 7 and WildFlya where he implements an codeExceptionMappercode which handles codeValidationExceptionscode in order to send convenient error reports to clients. Youre forced to to do it that way as Resteasy wont throw codeConstraintViolationExceptionscode directly for some obscure backward compatibility reasons.p  pTherefore in any codeValidationExceptionMappercode implementation one has to conduct some more or less intense inspection on the incoming codeValidationExceptioncode including checks on its type to make sure its an instance of codeResteasyViolationExceptioncode.p  pAnd then theres a line I dont understandp  precode ... if exception instanceof ResteasyViolationException              ResteasyViolationException resteasyViolationException  ResteasyViolationException.class.castexception             Exception e  resteasyViolationException.getException             if e  null                  return buildResponseunwrapExceptione, MediaType.TEXTPLAIN, Status.INTERNALSERVERERROR              else if  ... codepre  pfull code on a hrefhttpsgithub.comsamaxesjaxrsbeanvalidationjavaee7blobmasterwildflysrcmainjavacomsamaxesjavaxrsvalidationValidationExceptionMapper.java relnofollow titlegithubquotGithubap  pNow, under which circumstances would codee.getExceptioncode return something other than codenullcode For what reason does this method exist It is not required by the Bean Validation API, Resteasy javadoc does not explain a single thing at all and as you can see the code above isnt commented as well.

Positive 27300 pIn my test application JSF, PrimeFaces, Wildfly 8 I have a simple messaging interface for writing a message and viewing those that were sent to me. I now would like to create an automatic respond for those messages that were not answered after 5 minutes. This automatic respond is meant to be independent of any person sitting behind the browser window and clicking the refresh button.p  pMy current idea is to create a new class annotated with ApplicationScoped. This class shall run an individual thread handling the responding process. Would that be a good approach Or is there a functionality somewhere that already covers this matterp

Positive 27300 pFirst of all, I am a freshman in terms of Java EE and the Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers. So please pardon me if my concern seems kinda trivial, but I did research for quite a while now and couldnt find any helpful resource regarding my problem.p  pI would like to establish a NoSQL database connection for my project using JPA and EclipseLink to a MongoDB running on the default localhost27017.

Negative 27300 pI intend to develop a system that is entirely based on modules. The system base should have support for finding out about plugins, starting them up and being able to provide ways for those modules to communicate. Ideally, one should be able to put in new modules and yank out unused modules at will, and modules should be able to use each others funcionality if it is available.p  pThis system should be used as a basis for simulation systems where a lot of stuff happens in different modules, and other modules might want to do something based on that.p  pThe system I intend to develop is going to be in Java. The way I see it, I intend to have a folder with a subfolder for each module that includes a XML that describes the module with information such as name, maybe which events it might raise, stuff like that. I suppose I might need to write a custom ClassLoader to work this stuff out.p  pThe thing is, I dont know if my idea actually holds any water and, of course, I intend on building a working prototype. However, I never worked on a truly modular system before, and Im not really sure what is the best way to take on this problem.p  pWhere should I start Are there common problems and pitfalls that are found while developing this kind of system How do I make the modules talk with each other while maintaining isolation i.e, you remove a module and another module that was using it stays sane Are there any guides, specifications or articles I can read that could give me some ideas on where to start It would be better if they were based on Java, but this is not a requirement, as what Im looking for right now are ideas, not code.p  pAny feedback is appreciated.p

Negative 27300 pIll try to keep this example as simple as I can. Im trying to implement a domaindriven design a business object to represent each table in an old VB6 app which follows no OOP patterns.  The existing code is written just as you might expect from a 10 year old VB app i.e. use of ADODB.Recordset with no intellisense for fields. The existing code is nonOOP and I cringe at following its existing patterns. One of my challenges here is how to handle database changes as new requirements come up, without creating too much confusion to any developers who may look at the DB design later.p  pSuppose in this app we have a hypothetical Client table that is clearly overburdened as such clientId ClientName ContactName Address City State Zip Phone CreditLimit CurBalance and on and on and on...p  pA new requirement calls for new financial fields InterestRate  Terms p  pWould it be acceptable to break InterestRate and Terms into a separate Fiancials table, which may appear as a weird split since the existing 2 financial fields will exist in the original tablep  pIdeally the old financial fields CreditLimit, CurBalance would be relocated to this new table, but at the risk of breaking MANY parts of the app, it is not desirable to move fields.  I just want to stop the current practice of making a table wider and wider.p  pBasically, I am thinking I want to leave old codetable design alone, make a clean break with new fields, and create domain objects to handle any existing and new tables i.e. Client object could expose a Financials property representing the new Financials table.p  pIs it a good idea to TRY to make a clean break or just add new fields to the existing muck Is there a clever naming scheme for representing new tables versus the old How do you DBAs make a clean break without ripping apart the existing designp  pthanks for any thoughtsp

Negative 27300 pIm working on creating a simple MCV application, in order to understand MVC better. The problem Im having is registering event listeners. The way I see MVC is that the view dispatches events, the controller listens for these events and acts on them, either updating the model or amending the view. So in my MVC app I have a controller which during initialisation should register all the events that are dispatched by the view. This is my controllerp  ppublic class AppController extends UIComponent          private var modelStaffAppModelp  precodepublic function AppController modelStaffAppModel  trace controller created  this.model  model   start up register event listeners this.addEventListener saveUserEvent, saveUserHandler     event handler public function saveUserHandler eSaveUserEvent void  tracesaveUserHandler run trace e.userObj.getFirstname    codepre  pThe problem is in my client file Im writing a Flex based AIR app, so I have a MXML file. In this MXML file I initialise the controller and add the view components.p  p       precodeprivate function onInitvoid  var modelStaffAppModel  new StaffAppModel var controllerAppController  new AppController model    ]]gt ltmxScriptgt  ltmxVRule horizontalCenter56 bottom10 top10 width1 strokeColor000000gt  ltcompDetailsView x10 y17 width325 gt ltcompStaffListView x352 y10 height570 width400gt codepre  pThen I dispatch events from these view components. Heres an example of a view dispatching a eventp  ppublic function saveUservoid          userObj.setFirstname firstnameTxt.text      userObj.setLastname lastnameTxt.text      userObj.setJobtitle jobTitleTxt.text      var evtSaveUserEvent  new SaveUserEvent userObj p  precodedispatchEvent evt   codepre  pNow is this the way to do this, and why is it that my controller is not registering the event handlersp  pThanksp

Negative 27300 pOnce upon a time I had a little .net project called Intranet.  It simply served up web pages, and displayed some data retrieved from a database.

Id like to have one per logical area of functionality.  p  pHow can I do this  Is it a manual process of creating each project and copying in the code  Id like to have only one web.config for the whole thing.

Negative 27300 pIll be as direct as I can concerning this problem, because there must be something Im totally missing coming from a structured programming background.p  pSay I have a Player class. This Player class does things like changing its position in a game world. I call this method warp which takes a Position class instance as a parameter to modify the internal position of the Player. This makes total sense to me in OO terms because Im asking the player to do something. p  pThe issue comes when I need to do other things in addition to just modifying the players position. For example, say I need to send that warp event to other players in an online game. Should that code also be within Players warp method If not, then I would imagine declaring some kind of secondary method within say the Server class like warpPlayerplayer, position. Doing this seems to reduce everything a player does to itself as a series of getters and setters, or am I just wrong here Is this something thats totally normal Ive read countless times that a class that exposes everything as a series of getterssetters indicates a pretty poor abstraction being used as a data structure instead of a class.p  pThe same problem comes when you need to persist data, saving it to a file. Since saving a player to a file is at a different level of abstraction than the Player class, does it make sense to have a save method within the player class If not, declaring it externally like savePlayerplayer means that the savePlayer method would need a way to get every piece of data it needs out of the Player class, which ends up exposing the entire private implementation of the class.p  pBecause OOP is the design methodology most used today I assume, theres got to be something Im missing concerning these issues. Ive discussed it with my peers who also do light development, and they too have also had these exact same issues with OOP. Maybe its just that structured programming background that keeps us from understanding the full benefits of OOP as something more than providing methods to set and get private data so that its changed and retrieved from one place.p  pThanks in advance, and hopefully I dont sound too much like an idiot. For those who really need to know the languages involved with this design, its Java on the server side and ActionScript 3 on the client side.p

Negative 27300 pIn a DVCS, each developer has an entire repository on their workstation, to which they can commit all their changes. Then they can merge their repo with someone elses, or clone it, or whatever as I understand it, Im not a DVCS user.p  pTo me that flags a sideeffect, of being more vulnerable to forgetting to backup. In a traditional centralised system, both you as a developer and the people in charge know that if you commit something, its held on a central server which can have decent backup solutions in place.p  pBut using a DVCS, it seems you only have to push your work to a server when you feel like sharing it. Its all very well you have the repo locally so you can work on your feature branch for a month without bothering anyone, but it means I think that checking in your code to the repo is not enough, you have to remember to do regular pushes to a backedup server.p  pIt also means, doesnt it, that a team lead cant see all those nice SVN commit emails to keep a rough idea whats going on in the codebasep  pIs any of this a real issuep

Negative 27300 pIm trying to switch from AjaxControlToolkit to jQuery UI tabs for a fairly simple tab element.  Im 99 there with CSS and theming, but Im running into a wall attempting to get rounded corners on the tabs in IE.  jQuery UI provides the styles needed for rounded tabs in better browsers, but it might be a dealbreaker if we cant get them in IE.p  pI would emreallyem hate to have to keep using the Toolkit, and would also prefer not to bring in a different plugin to do the tabs although this is an option.p  pI tried .htc files, and while it may have easily been my fault, I could not get them to work for me.  CurvyCorners threw exceptions until I got tired of it and moved on.p  pAre there any IE roundcorners solutions that we KNOW can get along with jQuery UI tabs, or any workarounds specific to the tabs  I do not need rounded corners anywhere else.p  pP.S. Tabs can be of different lengths, so using presized background images really isnt an option.  Using multiple images, or resized images, would be fine as long as they can support arbitrary tab lengths.p  pThanks a lotp

Negative 27300 pI want to use protobuff in a Java application to facilitate serialization and I have a question about this quote from the Google web sitep  blockquote   pProtocol Buffers and OO Design   Protocol buffer classes are basically   dumb data holders like structs in   C they dont make good first class   citizens in an object model. If you   want to add richer behaviour to a   generated class, the best way to do   this is to wrap the generated protocol   buffer class in an   applicationspecific class. Wrapping   protocol buffers is also a good idea   if you dont have control over the   design of the .proto file if, say,   youre reusing one from another   project. In that case, you can use   the wrapper class to craft an   interface better suited to the unique   environment of your application   hiding some data and methods, exposing   convenience functions, etc. You should   never add behaviour to the generated   classes by inheriting from them. This   will break internal mechanisms and is   not good objectoriented practice   anyway.p blockquote  pfrom a hrefhttpcode.google.comapisprotocolbuffersdocsjavatutorial.html relnofollowhttpcode.google.comapisprotocolbuffersdocsjavatutorial.htmlap  pWhat does it mean when it says to wrap the created class p

Negative 27300 pWhile working on the simulation of particle interactions, I stumbled across grid indexing in Mortonorder Zordera hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiZorder28curve29 relnofollowWikipedia linka which is regarded to provide an efficient nearest neighbor cell search. The main reason that Ive read is the almost sequential ordering of spatially close cells in memory. p  pBeing in the middle of a first implementation, I can not wrap my head around how to efficiently implement the algorithm for the nearest neighbors, especially in comparison to a basic uniform grid.p  ol lipGiven a cell x,y it is trivial to obtain the 8 neighbor cell indices and compute the respective zindex. Although this provides constant access time to the elements, the zindex has either to be calculated or looked up in predefined tables separate for each axis and ORing. How can this possibly be more efficient Is it true, that accessing elements in an array A in an order say A[0]  Aa hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiZorder28curve29 relnofollow1a  A[3]  A[4]  ... is more efficient than in an order A[1023]  A[12]  A[456]  A[56]  ...pli lipIve expected that there exists a simpler algorithm to find the nearest neighbors in zorder. Something along the lines find first cell of neighbors, iterate. But this cant be true, as this works nicely only within 24 sized blocks. There are two problems however When the cell is not on the boundary, one can easily determine the first cell of the block and iterate through the cells in the block, but one has to check whether the cell is a nearest neighbor. Worse is the case when the cell lies on the boundary, than one has to take into account 25 cells. What am I missing here Is there a comparatively simple and efficient algorithm that will do what I needpli ol  pThe question in point 1. is easily testable, but Im not very familiar with the underlying instructions that the described access pattern generates and would really like to understand what is going on behind the scenes. p  pThanks in advance for any help, references, etc... hr  strongEDITstrongbr Thank you for clarifying point 1 So, with Zordering, the cache hit rate is increased on average for neighbor cells, interesting. Is there a way to profile cache hitmiss rates p  pRegarding point 2 I should add that I understand how to build the Mortonordered array for a point cloud in Rd where the index i  fx1, x2, ..., xd is obtained from bitwise interlacing etc. What I try to understand is whether there is a better way than the following naive ansatz to get the nearest neighbors here in d2, pseudo codep  precode Get the zindices of cells adjacent to the cell containing x, y   Accessing the contents of the cells is irrelevant here x, y elem R2     point  x, y zindex  fx, y      zx, zy  f1zindex           grid coordinates  nc  [zx  1, zy  1, zx  1, zy, zx  1, zy  1,   neighbor grid        zx    , zy  1,               zx,     zy  1,   coordinates       zx  1, zy  1, zx  1, zy, zx  1, zy  1]  ni [fx[0], x[1] for x in nc]     neighbor indices codepre

If you carefully look at the output, there are several consecutive numbers which are identical or very close e.g. 17, 15, 16... or 1, 1, ....

Negative 27300 pIm writing a functionparsing engine which uses regular expressions to separate the individual terms defined as a constant or a variable followed optionally by an operator.

Matches that match this second pattern need to be added to the function as subfunctions, not as individual terms, to ensure the correct evalutation order with parentheses.

This is bad I want grouped expressions to take precedence over single terms.

Negative 27300 pI am using the boost graph library to make a call to codedijkstrashortestpathscode. However, I have something special setup in that the codeweightmapcode is actually a functor. Hence, everytime the boost library requires the weight of an edge, my functor is called, makes a complicated computation and delivers the result back to boost.p  pUnfortunately, in codedijkstrashortestpaths.hppcode the struct codedijkstrabfsvisitorcodes method codeexamineedgecode has a codegetcode call to the weightmap, only to check if the returned value is negative. I am fully aware that I cannot use Dijkstras algorithm with negative values and I am certain that my functor only returns positive values. However, this check causes my functor to be called twice for each edge. As it performs a complicated computation Id like to avoid performing it twice the results dont change between calls.. each edge gets the same wait during a codedijkstrashortestpathscode run.p  pSo far, I am manually checking the edge passed to the functor and in case of the duplicate call I am returning the previous remembered result. This clearly is more of a workaround than a solution.p  pI tried to pass my own visitor that overwrites codeexamineedgecode, however, the original method defined by boosts codedijkstrabfsvisitorcode is still applied.p  pDoes anyone know if there is a better way to handle this situation and somehow avoid the negate edge weight checkp

Negative 27300 pI have webservice serverside implemented using axis2 in my project.  We want to enable WSsecurity in the existing web services. We are evaluating if apache ramapart module fits our need. Here is our requirement Basically we have inhouse security framework which provides encryption,signature and token generation capabilites. Our inhouse security framework basically requires a set of configurations in form of XML and it expose various APIs to do various security operations.p  pNow with above environment, I can think of three possbile solutionsp  ol lipI can develop an axis2 module around inhouse security framework and install it as .mar file in security phase. So I will not use apache rampart. But issue with this approach is I cant use wssecurity policy to specify security assertions and making sure incoming security tokens conforms to effective policy. It is like reinventing wheel what rampart already doing.pli lipI believe apache rampart underlines call to apache wss4j module for security operations. I believe apache wss4j module provides a way to register 3rd party security provider by implemeting CryptoProvider interface. I am not sure if this is feasible and viable solution. Please suggest.pli lipWssecurity policy allows to use a custom token. This custom token can be built up using our inhouse security framework. So basically it enables us to create wssecurity policy using apache rampart module and have custom token developed using our security framework. But I could not find help regarding this on internet. Could anyone please help with example.pli ol  pany other suggestions are also most welcome.p

Negative 27300 pI am currently trying to roll my own CSS style switcher for my basic intranet.p  pIts not hugely important, but I know a couple of employees have slightly poor eyesight and thought a high contrast style may be of some use.p  pHere is my ideal set up, and the way I have tried to implement so far.p  pBasically I already have a mysql database that house user log on details, and other minor preferences regarding the site. I would like to have an extra column for the style preference, and have a simple page in the user area where the user can preview, select and apply the style.p  pIt would obviously be good if when the user selects the style initially, it applies it to the page so that it can be seen in action, and then can be confirmed if it is what the user chooses.p  pWhat I have attempted so farp  pBasically, when the user logged on, it created a session variable which contains the value of the style column for that user. I went with numbers for the test, with a choice of 3 styles, 1, 2 and 3. Then in the head section of the page, for the href of the stylesheet, I added some PHP that evaluated the session variable and echoed a stylesheet based on what was set. p  pThat worked fine, the stylesheet was different depending on what was in the mysql table for the style column. On the user preferences page is where I fell apart a bit. I created a small form with 3 radio select buttons, one for each style. The only way I could see to go from here, was for the form to post to a PHP file that updates the table based on selection.p  pThe main problem I have doing it in this manner is that the user has to log out and back in for the changes to take effect. I would like a setup where the change happens on the spot or on a refresh.p  pI could go with cookies, but would rather avoid if possible. Dont know if anyone has any suggestions to help me along or if there are any pre written scripts that could accomplish thisp  pMany thanksp  pEdsp

Negative 27300 pI have an iPad project Im working on that dynamically creates a number of buttons that I need to add to the main view of my application.  I was planning on firing a method that lives inside my View from my ViewController...say its called addbuttons.  Its my impression that in the MVC pattern, the view should handle the rendering of buttons and the general display, but the controller should handle the interaction.  Im also under the impression that its bad design for the view to know about the view controller.p  pSo I guess my question is, should I have my button tap logic contained in my controller  If so, how do I handle the separation  If Im creating the buttons in my view, then it would have to have a reference to the view controller to use as the delegate for the event handler.  If I create them in the controller, then I feel like I need to set certain UI elements in the controller which seems wrong to me.  I know Im missing something obvious but searching so far has proven fruitless.p  pCan anyone point me in the right directionp
Negative 27300 pA bit of background first. I am finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a real symmetric matrix, in which rows sum to 0. More specifically, once I find an eigenvector, I use  argsort to find the permutation that sorts one of the eigenvalues and apply the permutation to the original matrix.p  pNow, I implemented the code in python, using the numpy package. The code itself is recursive, and if it finds a set of values in the eigenvector that are equal, it extracts the symmetric submatrix corresponding to the indices for which we have equal values, and applies the algorithm all over again on this matrix.p  pWhile this is all very well, and mostly grunt work, I was caught by surprise when a bunch of indices that should have corresponded to equal entries in the eigenvector were not recognized as having equal values. The problem was that the values were computed to machine precision by some algorithm possibly Lanczos, but I am not entirely familiar with numpy. This is a sample output, in which I explicitly check the difference between two entries in the eigenvectorp  precode    gtgtgt Tspectral.seriationA,index      columns [ 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11]      [  3.30289130e01  2.75240941e01  2.75240941e01   3.30289130e01     2.75240941e01   3.30289130e01  2.75240941e01   3.30289130e01     3.30289130e01  2.75240941e01  1.69794463e16  2.75240941e01]      [ 4  6  9  1  2 11 10  0  5  7  8  3]      difference   5.55111512313e17 codepre  pThe routine seriation is a recursive function. The array of floats is the eigenvector under consideration, and the array below that gives the sorted order of the columns. Note that columns [4,6,9,1,2,11] have the same value. However, eigenvector and eigenvalue calculations are always approximations, and indeed, when I output the difference between the entry in column 9 and column 2, it is nonzero. Where the algorithm should group [4,6,9,1,2,11], it only groups [4,6,9], and puts the rest in another group, throwing a wrench into the works. p  pSo the question is this is there a method to perform arbitrary precision calculations in numpy Failing this, what would be a good workaround to this problem p  pAlso, I should probably mention that it can be mathematically proven that these entries must be equal. That is a property of the matrix, but hopefully not germane to the question.p

Logging statements taking up to an hour to appear in the application logs.p  pThe problem doesnt appear related to heavy loads WAS is responding to page requests almost instantly, and I am testing against a box that isnt used for performance testing, and on a holiday no less  there is very little activitiy on the server. p  pMy guess would be that the thread associated with logging has been configured with very low priority, but I cant figure out where that would be configured via the admin console or the configuration files.p  pHas anyone else experienced this sort of issue with WebSpherep

Negative 27300 prvm had a substantial impact on ruby programming and for a long time brought lasting benefits to us, but honestly I need to stay agile and informed about other possibilities at this point. Lately I only get one version of Ruby to manage so Im not sure if the benefit is outweighing the cost of configuration. p  pOne alternative, a hrefhttpsgithub.comsstephensonrbenvrbenva, has worked well for me. rbenv is an alternative because it lets us set the global ruby version on a peruser basis, and like rvm offers support for perproject Ruby versions. Also you can override the Ruby version with an environment variable. I do not know what its like yet to use a hrefhttpsgithub.comjayferdryrya. If anyone has used ry or the other alternatives, please share any knowledge or experience on this question I feel is important. I am always interested in things I have not heard of and knowing more about some of these alternatives to Ruby Version Manager rvm. Also I feel grateful for Stackoverflow.com and this area of the internets wealth of knowledge. Thank you.p

Negative 27300 pHow can I make a HTTPHandler in an ashx file PLACE a SessionCookie managed by ASP.NET It seems, that the call of an ashxFile does not place a cookie, so no session can be maintained.p  pBackground I am about to write HTTP based web service wrapper.

Negative 27300 pThe pattern that Im going for is that of a gear shifter in a car. It consists of about 9 straight lines at 90 degree angles that I need a user to drag a UIView along.p  pMy first approach was to check the coordinates of the views center, and if the met certain conditions, enabledisable xy appropriately. This resulted in a long complex if statement that will be a mess to maintain. It works, for the most part  occasionally it gets stuck, but I know what I would need to do to fix it.p  pMy second idea would be to build a very simple collection of rectangles around my path with a space in the middle just wide enough to allow a square that I would have anchored to the view I want to move.

What happens is that once I insert the root as well as two other nodes everything is ok, the program fails if I try adding any more than those three nodes.

Negative 27300 pWe are using JSF 2.0 in our project. Apart from Mojara, we are using Primefaces 3.3 forsome components. we have a Requirement in our project that we HAVE to do Javascript validations as part of client side validation and then only the form submit should happen. The Validation done by JSF will anyway happen at server side. But the Javascript validtions should also be there.p  pThis was the reason I had asked a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11516564jsfroadmaptosupportclientsidevalidationsinfuturethisa question but got no comments.p  pI am therefore implementing the JavaScript validations and this brings me to the actual problem i am facing. I have JS functions to do basic validations like Required fields, length check etc and calling them at appropiate time like onblur. But if the user just leaves all the fields empty or does not go into some fields at allthereby not triggering events like onblur and clicks on the submit button, these fields are missed out for JS validations.

Negative 27300 pIve been recently trying to compile a static library for a game engine in Xcode. Im using OS X 10.8 and Xcode 4.4. I managed to copy the 10.6 platform from an old installation of Xcode. After a bit of copying stuff, I managed to get a runnable 10.6 SDK with appropriate headers and stuff. I had to use GDB for debugging, as LLDB doesnt like 10.6 any more. Debugging went OK for a bit, until I touched one build setting, no clue which. Doing a snapshot restore fixed nothing. Anyway, now debugging is really shakey. What will happen is this The first time I run the application, everything works normally. It launches the game, loads the static library, breakpoints work, everything is fine. But after that, the next attempt at running, and all future attempts result in this error messagep  precodeUnable to find Mach task port for processid 49069 oskern failure 0x5. codepre  pA crash report reports thisp  precodeThread 0 Crashed 0   dyld                            0x8fe01030 dyldstart  0 codepre  pThe debugger output shows no information other than whats normal.p  pIs there a way to get Xcode 4.4 to compile for 10.6 and run 100 of the timep  pEdit I tried using the technique described at a hrefhttpsourceware.orggdbwikiBuildingOnDarwin relnofollowhttpsourceware.orggdbwikiBuildingOnDarwina but the error still remains.p

Negative 27300 pI have an already shipped app on App Store that made use of Storyboard.p  pI see from the keynote, comparing to previous model that iPhone 5 has a taller screen.p  pI wonder how this will impact on my esisting storyboard, because from my app point of view theres only one difference which is the background.png. All the rest is just plain UITableView that can just fit more rows.p  pI cannot find any document for this on Apple site I have always been so noob in finding things on Apple developer site. Has anyone made adjustment to his already developed and published app to match with new layout  If yes, do I have to develop a brand new storyboard, or is there an adjustment to be done with code p  p[UPDATE]p  pI am reporting my experience, now that Xcode 4.5 is long shipped for development. Xcode itself, as some suggested, asked me if I would like to enable tallest screen support by creating a default png. After saying yes, I had to enter each segue in storyboard for some adjustment, change png background which was unstrechable by design with a tallest one, change stretching settings and redeploy.p  pIt has been an annoying work because I have quite some segues, and Xcode doesnt allow to reuse templates within Interface Builder.p

Negative 27300 pI am trying to populate a data frame from within a for loop in R. The names of the columns are generated dynamically within the loop and the value of some of the loop variables is used as the values while populating the data frame. For instance the name of the current column could be some variable name as a string in the loop, and the column can take the value of the current iterator as its value in the data frame.p  pI tried to create an empty data frame outside the loop, like thisp  precoded  data.frame codepre  pBut I cant really do anything with it, the moment I try to populate it, I run into an errorp  precode d[1]  c1,2 Error in [lt.data.frametmp, 1, value  c1, 2     replacement has 2 rows, data has 0 codepre  pWhat may be a good way to achieve what I am looking to do.

Negative 27300 pFirst time poster here but have been reading SO for ages and finally have run into a question that Ive not been able to answer.p  pIve got a ListView hosting a GridView with multiple columns.  One displays a price and another displays a currency code CAD, USD, GBP, etc.  This is all pulled out of SQL server using Entity Framework so the GridView is databound to a IEnumerable which stores the result of my query. The currency code is stored in a separate table with a localization string enUS, enGB which in a WinForms version of this app was previously used in String.Format to localize the currency to display the appropriate currency format and symbol.p  pThe problem I have is in XAML binding the ConverterCulture of the Price binding to the Currency.LocalizedCultureName to get it to format correctly.

Negative 27300 pIm a little confused about implementing a doubly linked list where the data in the list are pointers.  p  pThe private part of my linked list class looks likep  precode private     struct node        node next       node prev       T o          node first  The pointer to the first node NULL if none     node last   The pointer to the last node NULL if none     unsigned int size codepre  pAs you can see, the list is full of pointers to objects rather than just plain old objects, which makes it a little more confusing to me.p  pThe following is the description in the specp  pemNote that while this list is templated across the contained type, T, it inserts and removes only pointers to T, not instances of T.  This ensures that the Dlist implementation knows that it owns inserted objects, it is responsible for copying them if the list is copied, and it must destroy them if the list is destroyed.emp  pHere is my current implementation of insertFrontT op  precodevoid DlistinsertFrontT o    node insert  new node   insertgto  new To    insertgtnext  first   insertgtprev  last   first  insert  codepre  pThis seems wrong though.  What if T doesnt have a copy constructor  And how does this ensure sole ownership of the object in the listp  pCould I just dop  precodeinsertgto  o codepre  pIt seems like this is not safe, because if you hadp  precodeObject item  new Object dlist.insertFrontitem delete item codepre  pThen the item would be also be destroyed for the list.  Is this correct  Is my understanding off anywherep  pThanks for reading.p  pNote While this looks like homework, it is not.

Negative 27300 pIm just in the process of writing a PE file parser and Ive reached the point where Id like to parse and interpret the actual code within PE files, which Im assuming are stored as x86 opcodes.p  pAs an example, each of the exports within a DLL point to RVAs Relative Virtual Offsets of where the function will be stored within memory, and Ive written a function to convert these RVAs to physical file offsets.p  pThe question is, are these really opcodes, or are they something elsep  pDoes it depend on the compilerlinker as to how the functions are stored within the file, or are they one or two byte X86 opcodes.p  pAs an example, the Windows 7 DLL BWContextHandler.dll contains four functions that are loaded into memory, making them available within the system.  The first exported function is DllCanUnloadNow, and it is located at offset 0x245D within the file.  The first four bytes of this data are strong0xA1 0x5C 0xF1 0xF2strongp  pSo are these one or two byte opcodes, or are they something else entirelyp  pIf anyone can provide any information on how to examine these, it would be appreciated.p  pThanksp  pAfter a bit of further reading, and running the file through the demo version of IDA, I think Im correct in saying that the first byte 0xA1, is a one byte opcode, meaning mov eax.  I got that from here a hrefhttpref.x86asm.netgeek32.htmlxA1httpref.x86asm.netgeek32.htmlxA1a and Im assuming it is correct for the time being.p  pHowever, Im a bit confused as to how the bytes following comprise the rest of the instruction.  From the x86 assembler that I know, a move instruction requires two parameters, the destination and the source, so the instruction is to move something into the eax register, and Im assuming that the something comes in the following bytes.  However I dont know how to read that information yet p

Negative 27300 pWe are talking about a CRUD application with a little background processing about 20 decisions per user per day. Not big. We are planning for about 20 million transactions a day. Most of these transactions will be small textual. About 15 will be images sized at about 1MB. Mostly READ. Number of clients could be like 500,000 to 1 million.p  pWe are thinking of hosting it on Windows Azure. For this kind of application, what storage techniques could I use I was thinking about Azure Tables for images, SQL Azure for other transactional data. Would making more than one database make it more scalable I mean, if I have two entities, I could make two databases hosted on two different independent servers breaking normalization. Would that be beneficial I am confused here dont know much about handling large data.p

Negative 27300 pin iOS, A lot of times my project has similar screens with some differences here and there. With time a similar screen might come upp which I wont be aware of while I was making the  initial architecture.p  pSo, In such cases what I do is having few enum properties and put in ifelse statements do differentiate in the code.p  pLooks ugly specially when we implement something in TableView datasource and delegate methods, everywhere there is the same ifelse or a switch case.p  pNow If I make a separate VC then I have to copy paste a lot of same code here and there.

Negative 27300 pI am using the FOSUserBundle and the Group option. Registration works. Creation of groups works too. If I create 2 groups, admin and client and MANUALLY add a1i0s10ROLEADMIN to the admin group in the fosgroup table and then MANULLY setup and entry in the fosuserusergroup that ties an user to the admin group, logging in with that user will be able to log in as an admin.p  pHowever, there are, obviously, some disadvantages to this method. What can I use to add an user to a group now Using the promote commandline option will just add the role to that user but in the fosuser table, and since Im using groups I suspect that the roles column of the fosuser table is no longer used. And if it still serves a purpose, how do I assign an user to a group programmaticallyp  pMy other big question is how do I assign roles to groups. Maybe Im not getting something about the whole Groups idea, but I would have expected to be able to add the roles for a group at creation time, but the new form only asks for the group name and there doesnt seem to exist an equivalent of the user promote command for groups.p  pThank you.p

Negative 27300 pI have some WPF GUI hosted in WinForm which has multiple codeCheckBoxescode. The default value of codeIsCheckedcode of each codeCheckBoxcode need come from different boolean fields in some background data. Each boolean field in the background data is mapped to a codeCheckBoxcode in the codeVisualTreecode. So I bind the codeIsCheckedcode property of each codeCheckBoxcode to the codeCheckBoxcode itself and use a Converter to fetch the corresponding boolean value in the background data. This way the codeCheckBoxcode becomes an input to the Converter function so that the Converter can know its location in the codeVisualTreecode and query the correct boolean field in the background data. When the user changes the codeCheckBoxcode, codeCheckedUncheckedcode eventhandlers will set the value back to the boolean field in the background data. The XAML is like thisp  precode    ltDataTemplate xKeyModuleWithEnableControlgt         ltWrapPanelgt             ltCheckBox ContentEnable                        IsCheckedBinding Path., RelativeSourceRelativeSource ModeSelf, ModeOneTime,                                    ConverterStaticResource moduleEnableDisableConverter                                                          CheckedModuleEnabled UncheckedModuleDisabled                 gt         ltWrapPanelgt     ltDataTemplategt codepre  pThe Converter code is like thisp  precodeclass ModuleEnableDisableConverter  IValueConverter      public object Convertobject value, Type targetType, object parameter, System.Globalization.CultureInfo culture            System.Windows.Controls.CheckBox theBox  System.Windows.Controls.CheckBoxvalue       Here suppose to get the default value of the CheckBox       but just return true for now       return true       codepre  pThe Checked handler code is like thisp  precode    private void ModuleEnabledobject sender, RoutedEventArgs e              MessageBoxResult result  MessageBox.ShowEnabled, Confirmation, MessageBoxButton.YesNo, MessageBoxImage.Question         if result  MessageBoxResult.Yes                    Check the sender CheckBoxs location in the VisualTree,           Do set the boolean field in the background data                  return      codepre  pWhen program starts, the Converter runs first, since it returns ture, then immediately the Checked handler codeModuleEnabledcode runs.

The problem is when I click the button it first goes to the view controller that its connected to, and after that it executes the IBAction function. How can I change this orderp

Negative 27300 pIm attempting to create an codeArrayListcode so java, obviously with type codeTileEntitycode yes this is a minecraft mod. But I also need the objects added to the codeArrayListcode to implement a certain interface. p  pThe first option that came to mind was creating an abstract subclass of codeTileEntitycode that implemented interface, and using that as the codeArrayListcode type. But given the fact that people normally create their own subclasses of codeTileEntitycode and use those as the class they normally subclass, and I want people to be able to hook into my mod, I cant expect them to subclass anything besides codeTileEntitycode. p  pMy current solution is to check codeifobject instanceof MyInterfacecode before adding, but that seems ugly. Surely theres a way to set the type of an codeArrayListcode to require that an object be both a subclass of codeTileEntitycode and an implementor of codeMyInterfacecode.p

Negative 27300 pIm making a news archive. I want the news archive to have several options. At first I want the archive to have the option to only display news posted in a certain year and an option to display only news thats posted in a certain category. These features are both saved in my database at every post so with a small php code I can easily find posts created in e.g 2013.p  pThe problem is is that I want to make buttons in my news archive. Buttons that can make the user decide which feature is enabled or not if you understand what Im saying. I want the users to have the ability to make sure only posts of e.g 2013 appear on their screen but on the same time only posts of e.g sport news appear.  By making two features for the user to enable, I couldnt think of a way linking them to the correct page.p  pIf they click on a specific year they will go to article.phpyear2013 for example. But if you also want to use the other feature category its impossible because you will be send to article.phpcategorysport for example and the posts will no longer be searched on their published year but only on their category. p  pI want to make sure that if one featureoption is already enabled the other will only add ampcategorysport at the end of the URL so the URL becomes article.phpyear2013ampcategorysport which makes sure the user can select multiple features at the same time.p  precode   ltul classarchivegt             ltligt             ltdivgtYearltdivgt             ltulgt             ltligtlta hrefarticle.phpyearallgtEvery yearltagtltligt             ltligtlta hrefarticle.phpyear2013gt2013ltagtltligt             ltligtlta hrefarticle.phpyear2012gt2012ltagtltligt             ltligtlta hrefarticle.phpyear2011gt2011ltagtltligt             ltligtlta hrefarticle.phpyear2010gt2010ltagtltligt      ltulgt         ltligt           ltulgt     ltul classarchivegt             ltligt             ltdivgtCategoryltdivgt             ltulgt             ltligtlta hrefcategoryallgtGeneral newsltagtltligt             ltligtlta hrefarticle.phpcategorysportgtSport newsltagtltligt             ltligtlta hrefarticle.phpcategoryinternationalgtInternational newsltagtltligt             ltligtlta hrefarticle.phpcategorynationalgtNational newsltagtltligt          ltulgt         ltligt           ltulgt codepre  pI hope you understand my problem and look forward to hear from some of youp

I have an ASP.NET UpdatePanel, inside of which I have the button group. When any of the buttons are pressed, a command is executed server side.

Negative 27300 pI am using the NetBeans Designer to create a JFrame. Also it is worth mentioning I am fairly new to Java so I might not understand some things  do things correctly. The frame has about 100 panels, more buttons than I would even think about counting, about 40 tables, basically most swing components the NetBeans designer provides are being used within the frame. Also for the main frame I am using Null Layout in order to have a background image inside a JLabel. I know it is not recommended but it doesnt affect the general layout of things as Im using panelsLayeredPaneTabbedPane for everything, each with its own design most of them on Free Design with no Layout specified  thats how I started, didnt know about Layouts and it would  take ages now to rearange everything after using Grid Bag Layout for example.p  pNow getting to my problem, I need to be able to resize the frame and make it resize all components contained. I have to carry a presentation tomorrow of it and I just noticed it doesnt fit on smaller displays and resizing it doesnt do it properly, it just hides components. I do not care much if its just an improvisation  not the best approach to the problem as after the 15 min presentation I will probably never open it again. Thanks.p

The array can also have duplicates.p  pI had thought of building a frequency array f[] for the elements in the arrayspace oC and also another array cf[] for cumulative frequencyspace oC.p  pSo given i and j, i can look up the cumulative frequency array and do cf[j]  cf[i]  This will give the number of elements between i and j. To include i and j, look up the frequency array and add the values. ie cf[j]  cf[i]  f[i]f[j] Time complexity will be o1  4  constant time.p  pThe look up in the frequency array can be avoided by finding the previous non zero cf array element for both i and j in the respective direction. This will increase the time complexity but will reduce the space complexity.p  pWanted to know if there is a better solution for this problem.p  pNote  Values of i and j will be available to you only after the preprocessing is completed.p  pVijayp

Since ASSIMP now automatically calculates the correct tangent vectors I should have valid tangent vectors and my problem should be solved as noted by Nicol Bolas, but I still have the same issue with the specular lighting acting strange and the diffuse lighting not really showing up. I guess there is still something else that is not working correctly. I unmarked your answer as the correct answer Nicol Bolas for now and updated my code accordingly since there is still something Im missing.p  pIt probably has something to do with translating. As soon as I add a translate 22.0f in y direction to the Model matrix it reacts with strange lighting. As long as the floor which is actually a cube has no translation the lighting looks fine.p
Negative 27300 pI have written one test program on Solaris sparc server and compiled it using Sun Studiop  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt  using namespace std  int main      const int size   9999     char ptr[size]      while1             forint i  0 i lt size i                    ptr[i]  new char[2048]                 forint i  0 i lt size i                     delete[] ptr[i]                   return  9   compiled it as CC m64 g  codepre  pNow when I run it I can see that process size keeps on increasing and process crashes when it reached system memory limit. I traced it using truss and I can only see brk system calls. On searching some oracle sites I set LDPRELOADlibmapmalloc.so and then process size was constant. truss shows that this time it was using malloc to map anonymous memory pages.p  pOn other hand I tried to see this behavioud on RHEL Linux 2.6 x86 box as well and there too it used truss but process size was constant.p  pI dont understand behaviour or Solaris in first case where it uses brk to increase size of data segment but when I do a delete it didnt reduced it. Can somebody please explain me why solaris is doing this way p  pSo what different is linux doing here to keep process size constant as it also uses same system call.p  pThanks Niraj Rathip

Negative 27300 pIm searching for an algorithm respectively a method for learning user actions inputs in a certain program, and, based on a built information base of done user actions, to offer suggestions for future actions to the user. The information base should be built from the actions of multiple users using the same software. The user actions are dependent on the order in which they occur. This means, that a suggestion should be made based on already done user actions in a session. A session is an abstract time period, in which the user works with the software.p  pIn my initial approach, I thought of moddeling the user actions in a directed graph, where each node represents a unique user action instance. A user action, done for the very first time, generates a new node. The nodes have a counter representing how often a user did this user action. A transition from one node to another exists, when a user action is done after another one modelling the sequence of user actions. For every transition, the probability is computed based on the counters of the subsequent nodes i.e. nodes, to which there is a transition. There is a root node as starting point, which directs to all initial nodes user actions done first in a session. This could be a hidden Markov model, but I am not sure. It is definitely not a Bayesian network, because it can be a cyclic graph desireable.p  pAre there already methods, algorithms, libraries etc. for this problem If not, how is my approach Any alternatives, better ideasp

I read on the apple website states In iOS 6, you can further test iAd banner functionality in your developermode app by setting Fill Rate and Ad Refresh Rate in your devices Developer Settings. Adjusting Fill Rate allows you to test cases when a banner is available and when it is not. By setting Ad Refresh Rate, you can more efficiently test how your app handles banner loading and errors.p  pI keep getting didFailToRecieveAdWithError in my app that had previously been receiving iAds just fine.p  pI just noticed that in the Developer settings in iOS you can change the fill rate.

Previously, I used ncurses for this, but it has some limitations.

Negative 27300 pI wrote a program which copies an entire directory tree with lots of files in it. This happens simultaneously to two destinations. It generates the MD5 sums of each file in the source tree, dumps it to a txt file and does the same on destinations side and compares all three sums if they are equal, so that I can be sure every file is copied and checksum verified.p  pThe problem is that I first recursively copy the whole source tree first and then again  reading the whole source files for source checksum generation. It would be faster I think to copy a file and generating the source md5 sum right after copy file by file, so that the source files dont need to be read again.p  pSo my question is how can that done in an efficient and fast way One copy task could be 500GB of data and about 40.000 files.p

Negative 27300 pIn ObjectiveC we know that blocks have 3 implementations in runtime.p  ol licodeNSGlobalBlockcode  that is singleton in runtime, and it is created in case we dont use values of stack variables.li licodeNSStackBlockcode  that is not singleton, and it is allocated on stack not on heap, and it is created when we use some stack variables.li licodeNSMallocBlockcode  that is allocated on heap, and that is used when we want to store Blocks as ivar or property of some Class, or anywhere in heap f.e. codeproperty nonatomic, copy MyBlockType myBlockcode or when we use codeBlockcopycode function. It is really important because NSMallocBlock retains objects from context, and this fact can create some owning cycles, if we do not use blocks correct.li ol  pSo, my question is Where can I find the full explanation C lambdas runtime, and how they are processed by Compiler Or could you explain that Is there any specific issues with memory management using C lambdas Where lambdas are allocated, on heap or on stackp

Negative 27300 pI have been doing homework yesterday, I have done most of it, but couldnt make the main thing. I dont know why its not working I have asked other students, but nobody knows whats the problem. Basically this program is a small game, there are 18 players 9 on each team. the program randomly gives players coordinates and directions and they start to move. I have basically done the program, but I have problem with field, It doesnt show the players at all.  I tried many things and when testing noticed that it doesnt print even testing string in  the  if statement I wrote. when I write this part field[i][j]  ampplayers[k][0] I have checked if field[i][j] really gets the x and y coordinate and yes it does. but in the printfield class it takes field[][] as null and the field is empty. players is an array of  structs. field is an array of pointers that point to players or NULL.  p  pI have tried with all of my knowledge and couldnt make any better.

Negative 27300 pHi I wanna do something really simple a multilevel template system using only HTML and JS.p  pI would have like to do that with HTML only, I tried with object and embed tags but I cant make it work properly embed doesnt display and object generates a new HTML document with  and , plus its pretty ugly.p  pSo, next I tried handlebars.js but I didnt manage to use it to put HTML from a file into another one.p  pI just want to separate the distinct components of my page into different HTMLlike documents but not full HTMLvalid documents, just one with the header only, one with the navigation menu only, and so on. Then on level 2 I would have a structure HTMLbody document which would arrange the previous elements as I want one structure could have a menu on the left, content on the right and a footer, another would have menu on top, fullsize content and a header, etc. like the different themes of a CMS only much simpler. Then on level 3 finally, my real pages would use a structure template and then I guess I should use something like handlebars to pass content, titles etc. to level 2 and again to level 1.p  pSo, is there any easy way to do this Without having to rewrite a whole JS library P And if you think handlebars.js would suit my needs but I really dont need dynamic parts, just a title and a content for each page, maybe something to handle the current position on the website to manage menus and breadcrumb, could you please tell me how to use it to include HTML from one file to anotherp  pThank you very much p  pEDITp  pWell after a little bit of struggling, I dit it really easily with only jQuery.

Negative 27300 pIm trying to use NHibernate for a new app with a legacy database. Its going pretty well but Im stuck and cant find a good solution for a problem.p  pLets say I have this model p  ul lia Service table Id, ServiceName..li lia Movie table Id, Title, ...li lia Contents table which associates a service and a movie IdContent, Name, IdMovie, IdServiceli ul  pSo I mapped this and it all went good. Now I can retrieve a movie, get all the contents associated, ... My app is a movies shop generator. Each service is in fact a different shop, when a user enter my website, hes redirected to one of the shops and obviously, I must show him only movies available for his shop. The idea is  user comes, his service is recognized, I present him movies which have contents linked to his service. I need to be able to retrieve all contents for a movie for the backoffice too. Im trying to find the most transparent way to accomplish this with NHibernate. I cant really make changes to the db model.p  pI thought about a few solutions p  ul lipAdd the service condition into all my queries. Would work but its a bit cumbersome. The model is very complex and has tons of tablesqueries..pli lipUse nhibernate filter. Seemed ideal and worked pretty good, I added the filter on serviceid in all my mappings and did the EnableFilter as soon as my users service was recognized but.. nhibernate filtered collections dont work with 2nd lvl cache redis in my case and 2nd lvl cache usage is mandatory.pli lipAdd computed properties to my object like Movie.PublishedContentsInt32 serviceId. Probably would work but requires to write a lot of code and pollutes my domain.pli lipAdd new entities inheriting from my nhibernate entity like a PublishedMovie  Movie wich only presents the contextual datapli ul  pNone of these really satisfies me. Is there a good way to do this p  pThanks p

Negative 27300 pI am trying to make a python program that searches an imported text file for occurances of common words names in this case and then prints a list of the top three most common names in the file.

It gives me a nice list of three words that occur the most but the trouble is that the first and second most common on the count is F and M because it counts it as a separate word.

Negative 27300 pIm writing a jQuery interface to use a couple of OData services created in SAP. The services is working ok, and are also being used by some other applications.p  pIve already searched and Im mostly come across people who are saying its a cross domain issue. The first thing I tried was to plain and simply do a cross domain ajax callp  precode.ajax     url  httpsaphostname8000sapopuodatasapentitysetformatjson,     crossDomain  true,     xhrFields        withCredentials  true,           .. success, statusCodes, whatever ..  codepre  pThe responses that came from this call were 200, and if I viewed the content in the developer tools I saw my json message as I would expect it to be in there, but none of my callback functions were being triggered.p  pUpon searching more, somebody suggested using code.getJSONcode. This didnt work either. The error that kept coming back was 401, so I assumed it was a cross domain issue.p  pThe last thing I stumbled upon was codeJSONPcode. The response is coming back with an OK status code, and once again if I view the body content I see my json string as I would expect it. The only problem is my browser says there is a syntax error in the response text. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com8MtQn.png altenter image description herep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comvcPfy.png altenter image description herep  pAll of my search results have brought up issues regarding cross domain requests, and errors resulting therein. Maybe it is the issue, but because Im getting the results back that I would expect in the responses, Id have to assume that connectivity is no problem. p  ptldr ajax crossdomain requests are successful but dont trigger callback functions and jsonp gives me a syntax error. Im not sure where to keep looking. p

Negative 27300 pFirst off, I have some Lua code that runs in Cheat Engine to control some injected code in Sonic Adventure 2. Its not online dont worry. What that injected code does is call a function to render graphics inside the game. That function can only draw 3D lines though. Thats not really a problem, as I wrote a function to draw a cube out of 12 of them, and I could write functions for other shapes too.p  pNow I need to be able to rotate that cube. The way Sonic Adventure 2 handles rotation Im pretty sure is that it has 3 values stored in BAMS Binary Angle Measurement System basically, 360 degrees  0x10000. One value corresponds to each axis. Rotation is performed in the order Y, X, Z. As the drawing Im doing corresponds to objects inside the game, this is how I am handling rotation in my code as well. However, the rotation doesnt seem to work properly. While it still forms a hexahedron the corners are all still connected, etc. the cube appears sheared and squashed, and when I move the object, it moves in the wrong direction.p  pHeres the relevant portion of my codep  precodefunction DrawLine3DPerformRotationline, axis1, axis2, ctr1, ctr2, angle     Internal function used by DrawLine3D     if angle  0 then         for i1,2 do             local x  line[axis1..tonumberi]  ctr1             local y  line[axis2..tonumberi]  ctr2             local th  math.radangle  360  0x10000             line[axis1..tonumberi]  xmath.costh  ymath.sinth  ctr1             line[axis1..tonumberi]  xmath.sinth  ymath.costh  ctr2         end     end end  function DrawLine3Didentifier, x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2, color, temp     local line       line.x1  x1     line.y1  y1     line.z1  z1     line.x2  x2     line.y2  y2     line.z2  z2      DrawLine3DPerformRotationline, x, z, LDRotateCtrX, LDRotateCtrZ, LDRotateY     DrawLine3DPerformRotationline, y, z, LDRotateCtrY, LDRotateCtrZ, LDRotateX     DrawLine3DPerformRotationline, x, y, LDRotateCtrX, LDRotateCtrY, LDRotateZ      line.color  color     if temp then         LDLineListTemp[identifier]  line     else         LDLineList[identifier]  line     end     UpdateLineList end codepre

It doesnt make sense, why would taking a date and formatting it twice with UK standards return US standards. Maybe some bug in the string level where it flips the month and date Im at a loss.p  pUPDATE Turns out the Embedded Windows machine that the code is running on when in UK mode is buggy. It actually fails to localize altogether when on that machine. Now Im wondering if its a .net version that, instead of failing, fails silently and returns in the input.strikep  pFigured it out. If you send US dates through DateTime.TryParse, it uses the local machines locale to parse it.

Negative 27300 pIm making reports in visual studio for SSRS, I was wondering if I have a parameter which takes multiple values which end up populating my table if I could interpret these parameters. I would like to take the input from the user and perform some logic on it in this case compare it to a string, if it matches then use this, if it doesnt match then use the original input from the user. The list of possible entries is too large to have the user select from a predefined list too.p  pSo for examplep  pdata set is codeselect  from details where custnme in customerscodep  pThen the user can enter multiple values into customer. But sometimes the user might enter Mr Jackson instead of just Jackson and the database doesnt contain mr. So I need the report to interpret this as just Jackson.   pretend we cant tell the user not to use prefix MRp
Negative 27300 pI want to create a windows batch scripting whereby it allows the user to enter multiple choices at one go, and then after that the program will runs.p  pWith reference to this website a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14529246multiplechoicesmenuonbatchfile1478629414786294Multiple choices menu on batch filea, I get to know it somehow works to allow multiple selection.

And basically, codejcode, codekcode, codelcode and codemcode are not used. Im not sure if I interpreted it wrongly. Hopefully I did not interpret the coding wrongly.p  pSo for what I want is that...p  pWhen the user selects only 1 options, It will insert the Hello.txt into a command e.g.p  precodeecho This is complicated gt Hello.txt codepre  pBut if the user selects more than 1 options for example, user typed 1,2, then it will insertp  precodeecho This is complicated gt Hello.txt echo This is complicated gt Byebye.txt codepre  pAnd if the user selects option 5, it cannot be entered along with other numbers since it is ALL. Then it will echo the codeThis is complicated gt Byebye.txtcode , codeHello.txtcode , etcp  pIs there anyway to do it using batch scriptingp  pstrongEdit Can anyone explain this to me I tried finding different websites but I still dont get it.

Negative 27300 pSo far I was developing without versioning software and my application contains many files functionality, configuration files and autogenerated files. Now another two people will be working on this project so I want to use Git for our cooperation.p  pIm new to Git. I just set up Git repository on my server. I want to develop on my notebook and then commit changes to the server. Now Im not sure about how the first commit should look.p  pShould I include all the files autogenerated files, config files and functionality files into first commit, so my colleagues could easily checkout and get full project data to their localhosts or should I commit only functionality files exclude pictures, autogenerated files, configuration files, etc. p  pIf I commit everything, they can checkout and then ingnore config files because they have to edit them to fit their localhost environment and autogenerated files from future commits. p  pWhat is the best practise for this Thank you.p

So, I wrote a query off of the data to try and produce an additional column that would give me a decimal number to identify how many contacts each individual search caused limit to one contact per search.p  pstrongMy Query Code Crashes Access 2010 when I try to save or run itstrongp  precodeSELECT     [Search Events 2014].UserName,     [Search Events 2014].[Search Terms],     [Search Events 2014].[Event Triggered],     [Search Events 2014].[Returned Results],     [Search Events 2014].[Search Date],     [Search Events 2014].[Search Time],     [Search Events 2014].[Contact Date],     [Search Events 2014].[Contact Time],     [Search Events 2014].[Contact Type],     IIfCountSELECT [UserName], [Search Terms], [Search Date], [Search Time]                FROM [Search Events 2014]                WHERE [UserName]  [Search Events 2014].[UserName]                  AND [Search Terms]  [Search Events 2014].[Search Terms]                  AND [Search Date]  [Search Events 2014].[Search Date]                  AND [Search Time]  [Search Events 2014].[Search Time]                  AND [Contact Type] ltgt   CountSELECT [UserName], [Search Terms], [Search Date], [Search Time]                                                    FROM [Search Events 2014]                                                    WHERE [UserName]  [Search Events 2014].[UserName]                                                      AND [Contact Date]  [Search Events 2014].[Search Date]                                                      AND [Contact Time]  [Search Events 2014].[Search Time] gt 1,         1,         CountSELECT [UserName], [Search Terms], [Search Date], [Search Time]                FROM [Search Events 2014]                WHERE [UserName]  [Search Events 2014].[UserName]                  AND [Search Terms]  [Search Events 2014].[Search Terms]                  AND [Search Date]  [Search Events 2014].[Search Date]                  AND [Search Time]  [Search Events 2014].[Search Time]                  AND [Contact Type] ltgt   CountSELECT [UserName], [Search Terms], [Search Date], [Search Time]                                                    FROM [Search Events 2014]                                                    WHERE [UserName]  [Search Events 2014].[UserName]                                                      AND [Contact Date]  [Search Events 2014].[Search Date]                                                      AND [Contact Time]  [Search Events 2014].[Search Time]          AS [Contacts Generated] FROM [Search Events 2014] codepre  pIdeally, the query was supposed to run a subquery for each line of the [Search Events 2014] table where the data originally comes from to calculate the value I need in the new [Contacts Generated] column.

I think that would require me to create a separate manual query for every single search term in the database The database has over 600,000 rows and over 85,000 unique search terms.p  pIf there is a better, smarter approach to solving my dilemma such as Visual Basic macros, please let me knowp

Negative 27300 pWith the need of 3x images in iOS 8 I figured it would be easier to manage images with an asset catalog in Xcode 6. I am trying to just provide a single image, the 3x scaled image to the asset catalog and I want Xcode to automatically downscale that image to generate 2x and 1x versions of the 3x image, so that I dont have to do it manually.p  pRight now this is what I have img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comvsecl.png altp  pI really hope that Xcode has such a feature to automatically create 2x and 1x images and I just have not discovered it yet.

Negative 27300 pIm rewriting someones code who had a global variable that is useful during initialization when Java makes its callbacks into C, and just after. It appears they have declared this variable in several places with an codeexterncode prefix and once without. I dont really see why they would do this to a global variable prefixed codegcode when I would rather call it codestaticcode and declare it just once.p  pWould I be able to do this or does codestaticcode have negative connotations for thread safety in this context The bulk of my code is C but there is some codeextern Ccode stuff like those functions Java calls into.p  pCurrently Im not using codeexterncode or codestaticcode but Im inclined to believe this is why Im getting linking errors.p

Negative 27300 pSpinners provide two states. The first and default state emstate Aem shows the currently selected value. The second emstate Bem shows a dropdown menu when the spinner display is touched.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comlTTz7.png altState A and B examplep  pBy default a left padding is added to the items displayed in state A and B. I would like to remove it when the current selected value is displayed emstate Aem but to keep it when items are displayed in the dropdown menu emstate Bem. p  pSince the padding is set with the emCheckedTextViewem used in the layout that is specified when the spinner is created, my first try was to pass to the spinner constructor a custom layout that contains a CheckedTextView with empty padding. This way, the left padding disapears in state A but also in state B. However, my goal was to keep it for state A.p  pMy second try was to customize emandroiddropDownSpinnerStyleem in my theme definition. Since changing background color for emandroiddropDownSpinnerStyleem changes the background color of the item in state A only, my thought was to override the marginLeft or paddingLeft with a negative value. Unfortunately, it has no effect.p  pGiven that negative marginpadding seems not to be taken into account, I have tried the opposite. Firstly, I have used a custom item layout as explained for my first try in order to remove left padding on both states A and B. Secondly, I have defined a custom style for property emandroiddropDownListViewStyleem. Unfortunately, using a positive marginLeft value with the last property has no effect. Thus, I have set paddingLeft. It works and allows me to get the left spacing for state B only. However, the left space applies also to the background touch color cf. image below. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comPV8s9.png altenter image description herep  pI think that only the style for state A should be altered if I want to have the on touch background color that fully fills the dropdown menu width.

Thats fine so far. p  ol liHowever, if I now take a subset of such documents, which I later on read with an IndexReader, and I readd them to the TEMP Directory, is it appropriate for example to use also EnglishAnalyzer or does it cause restemming of already stemmed tokensli liAnd, if a field is not stored at all, I suppose it cannot be used for adding it to TEMP rightli ol

Therefor Id prefer a method that does not specifically check for the codetypecode attribute, but rather checks for eveything that is NOT codeproductidcode or codeprodnamecode and if it has a hit, merges this with a comma.p  pstronga hrefhttpjsfiddle.netmtb65phq2 relnofollowFIDDLEastrongp

Negative 27300 pI am looping through the images in a table, trying to get the source and then applying that src to a new image in a different table. I have managed to create new image objects in the new table cells tested but for some reason all I can get is the last image to display. Well, actually I know this is because the loop writes over the variable each time and it has the last value when it is applied, but I dont know how to get them all. Here is the relevant code.

Negative 27300 pWe want to migrate from websphere 7 to websphere 8.5. I dont have much experience with websphere. My problem is when I deploy the applications to the new 8.5 server i get following errorp  precodeE com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.webapp.WebApp notifyServletContextDestroyed SRVE0285E Exception caught while destroying context 0                                  java.lang.IllegalStateException No Factories configured for this Application. This happens if the facesinitialization does not work at all  make sure that you properly include all configuration settings necessary for a basic faces application and that all the necessary libs are included. Also check the logging output of your web application and your container for any exceptions If you did that and find nothing, the mistake might be due to the fact that you use some special webcontainers which do not support registering contextlisteners via TLD files and a context listener is not setup in your web.xml.

Negative 27300 pWere currently using CI on a few small projects before we jump the gun with our larger projects.p  pThe problem were facing is that continuously deploying updates is causing our environments to be dirty. What I mean by dirty is that old files arent being removed. After a while, its not uncommon for us to notice that dozens of files are no longer being used. For example, for our Python projects, we notice that many of our codepipcode packages located in our codevirtualenvcode are obsolete because we stopped using it.p  pOur current method is combating this issue is by nuking the folder where the application resides on the server and uploading the fresh artifacts created by our build server.p  pIs there an alternative way I ask because obviously, creating a brand new environment every time we push adds a substantial amount of time for our deployment. I figure this is quite a common problem, which is why Im a little surprised that I can find any literature with regards to this.p

Negative 27300 pIm using sample code from the TrivialDrive IAP sample which overrides the onActivityResult like thisp  precodeOverride protected void onActivityResultint requestCode, int resultCode,       Intent data         if mHelper.handleActivityResultrequestCode,                resultCode, data               super.onActivityResultrequestCode, resultCode, data         codepre  pNow, I also am wanting to retrieve data from another activity which means I need to use the overridden onActivityResult.

This code worksp  precodeOverride protected void onActivityResultint requestCode, int resultCode,       Intent data       super.onActivityResultrequestCode, resultCode, data     String extraDatadata.getStringExtraresult     SimpleAlertNotificationextraData, Alert message if working  codepre  pI dont understand this. It seems like the if statement is giving me a place to handle activities not involved in IAP, but its busting my ability to use the startActivityForResult style activity. I dont dare modify the IAP code because Im an Android newbie and I finally have IAP working reliably. p  pIm hoping someone else has been using this IAP sample code and has managed to integrate it into using startActivityForResult.p

Negative 27300 pRecently, I decided to get with the times and upgrade from VS2012 to VS2013. I downloaded the installer, and ran it. The first time around, the install failed around the 80th component, but I tried again and it worked. When it finished, I booted up VS, and it all looked fine, save for that little word on the splash screen, express. I didnt really care for a while, but now I need a GLSL plugin, and it wont install, on account of it being the express edition.

Negative 27300 pI am using jasper reports to print reports in my application. I have used sql queries to generate the data required. To do so, I pass the  SQL query and the JDBC connection object to the report as parameters to the  report. I then want to export the file to CSV format. The problem I am facing is that, amongst the columns that return from the query, one of them returns strings separated by n. When this file is exported to CSV and opened with  Excel of Libre office spreadsheet, the row size does not increase accordingly. The size of row is only enough to show the first string, even if there are more strings separated by n. If we manually increase the row size then they are visible. How can I handle this issue. I dont want my users to manually increase the row size. If there are strings separated by n I want to have excels rows get automatically get adapted to the row height. Is this possible to do I have tried various solutions but not able to that.

Negative 27300 pOne of requirements for implementing a REST Api is that the client has to send the required state information every time to the server to handle a specific request. Assume authentication is in place and Im successfully authenticating users to use the rest api, which means with every request im verifying that user has rights to access the api.p  pWhat if I have multiple users and each user has a different access right. So each user can only call a different set of webservices. Im wondering how this is normally handled by the server. I figure the only way to do this is to check the authentication of each uservia a password hash code,etc with each request to verify that he has access rights to the requested service. If that is correct then what are the recommended ways of handling authentication of multiple users in such a scenariop  pIm using flask to develop my api, so any specific suggestions will be much appreciated p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 27300 pI use coredata in my app for storing data. In my previous app version, it has some entities. Now I am doing the new version, and some attribute names and types of certain entities are changed. When I compile and run app in my device, it crashes and reports some error because the old coredata is not vilid anymore. I can solve this by deleting app from my device and recompile and install it. p  pMy question is, if the new version is downloaded from app store by user, would this change results in crashed in users device Because user would created some data and stored in older coredata. In addition, do I need to move the older data to new coredata, for example, an attribute name is changing from photoId to picId,then would older photoId values be lost due to this changep

Negative 27300 pIm experiencing a very strange issue in SQL Server 2005.p  pYesterday users reported slowness in a specific part of our database app. I am not sure how pervasive the slowness is  its definitely not everywhere, as this is the only part of the system reported  but I isolated the relevant stored procedure which used to run in 23 seconds and is now consistently running in 5060 seconds. p  pIts a complex query  multiple layers of subqueries. It returns only 42 rows in 16 columns. p  pThe query looks like thisp  precodeselect col1,2,3,4,5,... from   select ....  t ORDER BY col1 codepre  pI started picking apart the query to find out what was slow and found that removing the final codeORDER BYcode clause brought the performance back in line. p  pThis is highly mysterious. I could not replicate the problem on our DEV server. Its only 42 rows so the order by clause should be inconsequential. Execution plans are identical w and without the order by, and on the two servers. p  pAny brainstorming about what could have changed on our production server would be much appreciatedp

Negative 27300 pMy example below uses variadic templates to register a function inside a class. Registering a single function works but what about class member functions I tried stdbind but this expects placeholders which is not an option because I dont know the number of arguments.

Negative 27300 pOkay guys, I have this idea to recreate a program wich could find the best rout in IP networks. I found one guy on the internet who did it, and he shared some code..but whatever Im doing with it, I cant make it work. Im using Visual Studio 2012 with latest BOOST libs, C.p  pThe IP protocol has a possibility of data transmission by the nonstandard routes. therefore, at the IPpackege header, you can specify specific source routing option of IPaddresses list network routers through which the packege is forwarded for delivery to the addressee. Simultaneous transmission of data over the standard and alternative routes will reduce the tense on the standard route and increase the bandwidth of the connection with the addressee.p  pThe main goal of that project is increasing bandwidth of connections with userdefined route of simultaneous use of several channels of data, the plan was divided into subtasksp  ol liDevelop an algorithm to determine the connectivity of nodes IPbased network in a given direction.li liDevelop an algorithm of finding and selecting alternative routes of transmission data in a predetermined direction.li

Negative 27300 pIn a translator app Im working on, the keyboard transitions works fine when connected to internet. The text input field above the keyboard scrolls up and down with the keyboard. But when it is not, an UIAlertView is used to display the absence of internet. This causes the codeUIKeyboardWillShowNotificationcode to fire and causes a glitch in the codeUITextViewcode.

Negative 27300 pThis might be some rookie question, but I cant find a direct answer during my research.p  pWorking with a JAVA Web project that makes use of SSO, there are some libraries getting the logged user the following way request.getUserPrincipal.p  pIt was alarming to me, receiving this data on the request, since that could be imposed my first assumption is that the request comes from the webclientbrowser.p  pBut checking the running application, I dont see a single place where that data travels in the request more than the log in page itself, that of course sends username and password.p  pSo, Im assuming that the server is augmenting the request and putting the user information that is actually stored in the session which would be secure but I cant find any clear documentation that supports my theory.p  pSo, could anybody explain or point me to some good and straight explanationp  pThanks Regards.p

In this application users will only 99 of the time have readonly access as they will just see data codeSELECTcode.p  pHowever the backend database is going to be the beast where every minute there will be records updated  inserted  deleted.

If I write a C tool which will get data from any number of sources xml, csv or direct from some tables from a remote db, a configuration file or registry setting will dictate which format the data is being imported from and then do the insert  update  deleted, will this be fast enough andor will cause deadlock issuesp  pI hope my questions are elaborate enough...

Negative 27300 pSo Im working on an html5 app and want to read and write data to a server not local storage, has to be a server using AJAX  PHP  MySQL.  Some of the data will be specific to individual users, so I need to find a way to identify the user from within the app using javascript.  Right now a the user logs on by authenticating with PHP and a session is created.  After logging in, the javascript application is loaded into a div before logging in, the script is inaccessible as its provided by PHP after authentication.p  pIve thought about just grabbing the username after successful authentication, and storing that in a JS variable, and using that variable to readwrite to the DB based for that user, but, I think this would easily be exploitable anyone could modify the JS client side and just send someone elses user name, thus writing to that users entries.p  pWhat is a better way of doing this  Or, is there no way, and is that why I havent been able to find any serverside storage examples for HTML5 appsgames, and only client localstoragep

Negative 27300 pIm tasked with writing a c program that creates a sort of text editor in the terminal. The text editor consists of individual lines. Each individual line must represent a member of a linked list. Im following a format of making two classes. One being a list of lines and the other being a class for the lines. They are friend classes. For every new line a line object is created and added to the linked list. The list of lines class manages the line objects and the linked list by performing operations such as inserting lines and deleting them from the linked list.p  pMy question is, for each individual line should I store it as a character array, a string, or a vector p  pIt should also be noted that the lines need not be editable once they are added to the linked list. They can just be deleted and a new line can be inserted. Only three operations will be possible. Inserting an entire line into the list, adding a line to the end of the list, and deleting an existing line from the list. The content of any given line will not be altered after it is created and added to the list.p  pSome sample output that I was givenp  precode1gt The first line 2gt The second line 3gt 4gt And another line 5gt One more line 6gt 7gt what do you try to type here 8gt  9gt 10gt  11gt This is the last line gt I 2  2gt This line should be inserted into line number 2 gt L  1gt The first line 2gt This line should be inserted into line number 2 3gt The second line 4gt 5gt And another line 6gt One more line 7gt 8gt what do you try to type here 9gt  10gt 11gt This line is boring...... 12gt This is the last line gt I 16  16gt The line number is big BIG gt L  1gt The first line 2gt This line should be inserted into line number 2 3gt The second line 4gt 5gt And another line 6gt One more line 7gt 8gt what do you try to type here 9gt  10gt 11gt This line is boring...... 12gt This is the last line 13gt 14gt 15gt 16gt The line number is big BIG codepre
