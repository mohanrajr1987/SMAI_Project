Positive 905 pBrowser users are used to zooming content when it is too small.  This increases the detail on text and SVGs.  Unfortunately, it does not seem to increase the resolution of a ltcanvasgt  Ive seen a couple of articles explaining how to control whether the pixels get antialiased or pixellated.p  pWhat I have not found is any explanation of how to redraw the canvas at a higher resolution.  For example, if my original page has a 300x300 canvas and I zoom to 200 I would like to draw a 600x600 pixel image in that canvas and have the user see all the detail.p

Positive 905 pI am creating a floating banner ad that is supposed to stay fixed to the bottom of the page. I created the ad and uploaded it to DoubleClick Studio. In the preview tab Im seeing that the ad doesnt stay fixed to the bottom of the page and instead moves up and down with the content as it scrolls. Ive inspected the banner on Chrome to find that the container div that houses the ad is set to position absolute instead of position fixed. If it was set to fixed this would solve the issue, but I have no control over changing the positioning of the container of the ad, I can only say where the ad should be positioned  bottom, top, left or right.p  pHas anyone experienced this issue Does anyone have any ideas for how this can be fixed Ive reached out to a few people at DoubleClick hoping that theyll have some suggestions, but I thought that the stackoverflow community would be able to help as well.p  pIf it helps, I used Google Web Designer to create the banner ad. This is the first HTML5 ad that Ive created and uploaded to DoubleClick Studio. All previous ads were Flash banners.p

Negative 905 pWere looking at how to do distributed configuration within our primarily Java based deployment. We have a number of applications and it makes sense to centralise the configuration of the applications. JNDI appears to be the standard choice, probably backing off to something like ApacheDS that way we can store non Java config in there as well. Here are some of the things that Ive considered. Has anyone tried something similar Any recommendationsp  h3Distributedh3  pThis would be for multiple applications on multiple machines, some of the applications would be clustered. The Directory Server should also ideally be clustered.p  h3Lightweighth3  pJNDI has a bit of a J2EE feel to it. Anyone use an alternative distributed configuration mechanism. The applications themselves tend to be relatively lightweight rather than full Java EE applications ok controversial whether Java EE is still considered heavyweight and requirements are certainly heavyweight.p  h3Supports fallbacksh3  pOften the same configuration applies to multiple applications e.g. multiple applications may connect to the same database. One the other hand, some applications may need specific configuration. Sometimes it is difficult to know in advance whether an application will use a global configuration or something specific, so being able to first search for application  host specific configuration and then falling back would be good. Im thinking of a structure something like thisp  pglobalhostapplicationinstance or globalapplicationhostinstancep  pso, start by checking to see if there is any configuration specific to this instance of the application on this host, then check if there is any configuration specific to this application for this host, then check to see if there is anything specific for this application, then try the global setting. Are there any best practices for this kind of thingp  h3Live configuration changesh3  pSpring allows configuration with a jeejndilookup and you can choose not to cache the value which means it is looked up each request. Im not sure that makes sense for String type configuration values. It also doesnt appear to use the NamingListener way of detecting changes in the DS.

Negative 905 pAnd this is pretty annoying since we have it set up to continuously check svn every 20 seconds. So if svn is down for some reason we could potentially be getting 3 error emails every minute. p  pFor example, svn was down today and I had about 90 emails from CruiseControl.net on how it cant connect to svn in my inbox when I came in the morning cruisecontrol starts at 830am and I come in at 900am, 3 errors per minute, so 33090 messages.p  pMind you, the notificationType for emails I have set up in cruisecontrol is Change. But I guess this only pertains to builds and not actually checking svn.p  pNow dont get me wrong, Id like to know when theres a problem connecting to SVN but 1 email would be nice and not a zillion.p  pAny ideas thanks in advance..p

Negative 905 pA product Im helping to develop will basically work like thisp  ul liA Web publisher creates a new page on their site that includes a codeltscriptgtcode from our server.li liWhen a visitor reaches that new page, that codeltscriptgtcode gathers the text content of the page and sends it to our server via a POST request crossdomain, using a codeltformgtcode inside of an codeltiframegtcode.li liOur server processes the text content and returns a response via a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiJSONPJSONPJSONPa that includes an HTML fragment listing links to related content around the Web. This response is cached and served to subsequent visitors until we receive another POST request with text content from the same URL, at which point we regenerate a fresh response. These POSTs only happen when our cached TTL expires, at which point the server signifies that and prompts the codeltscriptgtcode on the page to gather and POST the text content again.li ul  pThe problem is that this system seems inherently insecure. In theory, anyone could spoof the HTTP POST request including the referer header, so we couldnt just check for that that sends a pages content to our server. This could include any text content, which we would then use to generate the related content links for that page.p  pThe primary difficulty in making this secure is that our JavaScript is publicly visible. We cant use any kind of private key or other cryptic identifier or pattern because that wont be secret.p  pIdeally, we need a method that somehow verifies that a POST request corresponding to a particular Web page is authentic. We cant just scrape the Web page and compare the content with whats been POSTed, since the purpose of having JavaScript submit the content is that it may be behind a login system.p  pAny ideas I hope Ive explained the problem well enough. Thanks in advance for any suggestions.p

Negative 905 pI have a set of data points, each described by a dictionary.  The processing of each data point is independent and I submit each one as a separate job to a cluster.  Each data point has a unique name, and my cluster submission wrapper simply calls a script that takes a data points name and a file describing all the data points.  That script then accesses the data point from the file and performs the computation.p  pSince each job has to load the set of all points only to retrieve the point to be run, I wanted to optimize this step by serializing the file describing the set of points into an easily retrievable format. p  pI tried using JSONpickle, using the following method, to serialize a dictionary describing all the data points to filep  precodedef jsonserializeobj, filename, usejsonpickleTrue     f  openfilename, w     if usejsonpickle     import jsonpickle     jsonobj  jsonpickle.encodeobj     f.writejsonobj     else     simplejson.dumpobj, f, indent1        f.close codepre  pThe dictionary contains very simple objects lists, strings, floats, etc. and has a total of 54,000 keys.  The json file is 20 Megabytes in size.p  pIt takes 20 seconds to load this file into memory, which seems very slow to me.  I switched to using pickle with the same exact object, and found that it generates a file thats about 7.8 megabytes in size, and can be loaded in 12 seconds.  This is a significant improvement, but it still seems like loading of a small object less than 100,000 entries should be faster.  Aside from that, pickle is not human readable, which was the big advantage of JSON for me.p  pIs there a way to use JSON to get similar or better speed ups  If not, do you have other ideas on structuring thisp  pIs the right solution to simply slice the file describing each event into a separate file and pass that on to the script that runs a data point in a cluster job It seems like that could lead to a proliferation of files.p  pthanks.p

Negative 905 pI was trying to test the performance difference between inserting into a table directly versus inserting into a view in a different database which points to the table. I was shocked to see that a WHILE loop with 10,000 inserts into a simple table took 3 seconds but against the view it took 30 seconds.p  pAs I investigated, I found that if I switched windows in SSMS the view performance was the same as that of the table as I thought it should have been. I then switched DBs in the view window to the table DB and inserted there and it was slow when going directly against the table.p  pThis pointed me to the idea that there was some difference in the connections. These were different tabs in SSMS, one created from the other with N. I didnt issue any SET commands other than SET NOCOUNT ON in both windows and all statistics, query plans, etc. were turned off.p  pWhen I ran SQL Profiler to look at the connections, they had identical settings. The performance difference was 100 consistent though.p  pI checked that there were no transactions open in either connection.p  pI tried opening another instance of SSMS and I cannot duplicate the slow performance although it is happening in two out of three of my tabs in the first instance of SSMS.p  pThis is all on a local server. Im going to need to shut it down in about an hour and I dont know if I can reproduce this problem, so hopefully I can get some suggestions before then p  pAny other ideas on what the difference might bep

Negative 905 pIm in great need of a way to dig through potentially huge amounts of CGI supplied POST data. p  pWith reading the GET data its no big deal, as I can just rerequest the codeQUERYSTRINGcode environment variable as often as I want, but with POST data which is supplied via codestdincode.

Negative 905 pI was reading a book and it talks about a codeUsercode has some more codeUserDetailcode, and so the codeUserDetailcode will have a codeuseridcode pointing back to the Users table.  I kind of forgot that, does it help at all to has a field in codeUserscode table to have a codeuserdetailidcode to point at the UserDetail recordp  pThis is so in Ruby on Rails too, that the codeUserscode table doesnt have a codeuserdetailidcode, but the codeUserDetailcode table has a codeuseridcode.  And the codeUsercode model use codehasone userdetailcode, while the codeUserDetailcode model use codebelongsto usercode.p  pIt kind of makes sense that if it is a onetomany relationship, then at the Many side, we have an codeforeignidcode pointing back to the One side, but the One side doesnt need to point to the Many side, so it looks like a onetoone doesnt need to have it pointing both ways too, as one side is enough.p

Negative 905 pFirst, I hope this is the right place for this question. Because I believe this to be a server configuration problem, I wasnt sure if this should go on serverfault.p  pSo we have a springmvc webapp running on Tomcat servers and connected to an Oracle database. On one of these pages is a form for the user to fill out where they can enter a set of dates. When I or another developer run the webapp locally on our own machines for testing still connecting to an external Oracle instance, we have no problems. But now that the webapp has been deployed to two different external Tomcat servers weve noticed problems with the dates.p  pSomewhere between when the data is submitted from the page verified using Firefoxs TamperData plugin to the controller and when it is inserted into the database, all of these user inputted dates lose one day. For example, entering 09022010 gets inserted into the table as 09012010. If we submit 09012010, it is inserted as 08312010. These user dates are never explicitly modified in our code.p  pThose date fields in our spring entity beans are annotated with the following p  precodeTemporalvalue  TemporalType.DATE Columnname  STARTDATE, nullable  false, length  7 DateTimeFormatpatternMMddyyyy codepre  pAlso, at some point during the data processing. we set up a field with the current datep  precodeobj.setActivityDatenew Date codepre  pThose activity dates are unaltered and always come through with the correct date when we check the database.p  pLike I said, were unable to reproduce this error when we run the app locally, so we want to believe the problem is with one of the other Tomcat servers that we have deployed to. Has anyone ever run into a problem like this before, or do you have any ideas of what could be causing itp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pSo I took the timezone hints and it sent us off in the right direction, but were still not there yet. I went into my entity bean, changed the field from java.util.Date to a jodaTime DateTime object, like thisp  precodeColumnname  STARTDATE, nullable  false, length  7 DateTimeFormatpatternMMddyyyy Typetype  org.joda.time.contrib.hibernate.PersistentDateTime private DateTime startDate codepre  pAfter making adjustments to handle the new type, I ran some more tests and we can now see that the date 09012010 is being inserted into the database as 08312010 80000 pm. I think that the TemporalTypeDATE may have been forcing a truncation somewhere along the line, which is why we didnt see the timestamp before. Here are the timezone settings that I know of our office is in Virgina, USEasternp  ul liTomcat is launched with the timezone set to EST5EDT.li liThe linux servers that host Tomcat are set to EST.li liThe linux server that hosts the Oracle instance is set to EST.li liThe Oracle database timezone is set to UTC 0000li liThe timezones for the user sessions in Oracle are currently set to 0400.li ul  pIf this was all there was to it, then I could understand why a user input date with no explicit time zone would be translated in the database as 0400. But we still cannot reproduce the problem locally on our own machines Windows 7 and Fedora, both set to USEastern. Ive tried manipulating dates to force a time zone, but it always comes through as 800pm. Here is the log output from two separate runsp  precodeStoring date startDate 20100901T000000.000  Storing date startDate 20100901T000000.0000400 codepre  pEach of those dates went from Tomcat with SpringHibernate into the database as 08312010 800PM when run on the external Tomcat servers, but inserted as 09012010 1200AM when run locally. The only good thing to come out of this so far is that the dates are retranslated when pulled from the database and displayed to the user on the screen, so that it matches what they originally typed in.p  pIn order to be able to develop consistently, we need to know what setting we could be missing on our local machines that is avoiding this problem. Were currently using Tomcat 6.0.20, bundled with NetBeans to run locally.p

Negative 905 pI am studying the Code Access Security of .NET 2.0. My current understanding is as belowp  pemThe basic mechanism of the CAS is for the CLR to collect certain evidences from the assembly, and then use the evidence and policy to work out a permission set for the assemblys code. And the assemblys code can do nothing beyond that permission set.emp  pEvidence is used to classify certain assembly into certain code group, and permission set is given on a code group granularity. p  pTherere several types of evidence can be collected by the CLR at runtime.p  pIt is easy to determine evidence such as emApplication Directory, GAC, Hash, Strong Nameem.p  pBut how to determine evidence such as emPublisher, Site, Zone, URLem Where are these evidence data stored Are they part of the assemblys metadata I dont think that evidence like Zone or Site should be part of the metadata.p  pMany thanks.p

Negative 905 pCan someone confirm or clarify for mep  pFrom what I can tell, Java EE web apps consist of a Servlet andor JSP driven dynamic web page being fed back in the HTTP response, triggered by the Java EE server receiving a HTTP GET or POST request.p  pFrom what I can tell, Java EE web services also make use of Servlets as the web tier components, however a WS Servlet receives a SOAP message and validates the contents of those messages with whatever WSDL the Servlet is WARed with.

Negative 905 pI have an app that is essentially a wrapper for a 3rd party API. The app does not use a database and only stores a single cookie which is the session ID that the API requires.p  pThe API is a shopping system which allows users to p  ploginregisteredit profilelogoutp  pbuy merchandisep  pmake a donationp  pbecome a memberp  pThe API has 50 or so methods that my app needs to connect to. Example API calls are addItemToBasket, addDonation, GetUserDetails etc.p  pI am trying to work out what should be classes in my application. Here is what I have so farp  pstrongClassesstrongp  p1 strongAPIManager Classstrong Contains the methods that match onetoone with the methods exposed in the 3rd party API and provides the mechanism to make a connection to the remote API server. So a user would be logged in via p  precodeAPIManagergtloginUsersessionKey, uid, pwd codepre  pand the remote API would set the user as logged in. If needs be, my app can check the logged in status of any session key by calling the APIp  precode APIManagergtisLoggedInsessionKey codepre  p2 strongUser Classstrong This holds methods that contain business logic required before processing API calls such as Register or Login. An example method isp  precodefunction loginPOST      perform sanity checks, apply business rules etc.     if certain conditions are met, we may pass in a promo code, pc      APIManagergtloginUsersessionkey, POST[uid], POST[pwd], pc  codepre  pI realise that I could probably just make a call to APIManager from the login page, rather than having a User class per se, but I felt that since some business logic needs to run before we actually call the APIs loginUser method, it felt right to have that handled within a User class. Id be keen to know what people think about this.p  p3 strongBasket Classstrongp  pThe basket is managed in the 3rd Party API, so my apps role is to make the appropriate API calls to add new items to the basket, remove items, view the basket etc. My app knows nothing about the basket until the data is retrieved from the API, nor can it make any changes to the basket without going via the API. Again, it felt appropriate to group this related logic into a Basket class. The front end web page might call something likep  precodeBasketgtaddItem23 codepre  pand this addItem method in the Basket class would looks something likep  precodeaddItemitemID     perform checks, apply business rules e.g. if user is eligible for discount         APIManagergtaddToCartitemID, discount  codepre  pwhere addToCart is the third party API method we call to process the item.p  p4 strongDonation Classstrongp  pThis allows users to make a donation. The donation appears in the basket and can be removed from the basket. I thought of just adding an addDonate method to the Basket class and not worry about having a Donation object at all, but... see belowp  p5 strongMembership Classstrongp  p... memberships are actually a type of donation The API will treat donation going into a certain account as being a 1 year membership, and not a plain donation. We cannot change the logicbehaviour of the 3rd party API.p  pSo, if I donate 50 to account 1 then its just a normal donation, but if I donate 100 to account 8 then I become a member with all the member benefits reduced prices, no postage fee etc.p  pHeres where Im not sure of the best way to design this.p  pShould I create a Donation class and then extend that with Membership, since all of the Donation methods will be required by Membership. But Membership will need additional methods such as renew or getExpiry etc.p  pAlso, should I look at extending User to become Member Again, a member has all of the core methods that User has, but also has additional ones such as getSpecialOffers or getDiscountCode that only members would access.p  pAny guidance in how to best approach the design would be very much appreciated.p  pThanks, Jamesp

Negative 905 pSuppose there is a blog with posts, comments and users which can comment.

Because of doing fragment caching on posts and comments, Johns comments will point to Johns wrong URL unless the fragment is expired. It can be possible to manually touch or expire all posts that contain comments by John in this example, but in a complex application this would require very complex queries and seems very errorprone.p  pWhats the best practice here Should I use nonSEOfriendly URLs such as users13 instead of usersjohn  Or maybe keep a list of old URLs until the cache is expired No solution looks good to me.p  pEDIT Please note this is just a simplified example  its definitely very simple to query posts and touch them in this case. But a complex app implies many relationships among objects which makes it hard to track every object that has a reference to a user. Ive researched a bit on this  Facebook only allows setting your username once, so this problem doesnt exist.p

Negative 905 pOk, I think the question I had here was longwinded and difficult to get through. Ill simplify my questionp  ul liI have a class called strongInControllerstrong.li listrongInControllerstrong has a method called codenextPagecode that tells an int variable, codeinPageNumbercode, to add one onto itself and to call on another strongInControllerstrong method called codeupdateTablecode.li licodeupdateTablecode clears a table, stronginTablestrong, of its current data and fills it with data relevant to the page number it retrieves from codeinPageNumbercode.li liThe table, stronginTablestrong, is contained inside an codeNSBoxcode with specific printing requirements.li liI subclassed codeNSBoxcode into a class called strongCustomViewPaginationstrong to meet these printing requirements, overriding its paginations methods. Basically, when a new printing page is required, it attempts to print the same area again, but calls on codenextPagecode to fill the table with the data of the sequential page.li ul  pWith me so farp  pOne of the pagination methods I overrided in strongCustomViewPaginationstrong, codebeginPageInRectcode, is automatically called for each printed page by default. Because of this, I placed a call to my strongInControllerstrong method of codenextPagecode, to change the stronginTablestrong data for the current printing page.p  pMy problem is when I call codenextPagecode which is a method in strongInControllerstrong from my strongCustomViewPaginationstrong class. It does nothing and when I debug it I find that all the variables required in the method are nil. However, they are the correct values when I call codenextPagecode from inside strongInControllerstrong.p  hr  h1File Extractsh1  pstrongInController.hstrongp  precodeimport ltCocoaCocoa.hgt import CustomViewPagination.h  interface InController  NSObject      IBOutlet NSWindow inPreview     IBOutlet CustomViewPagination inSheet     NSArray iSelectedIn     NSMutableArray records     int inPageNumber  property nonatomic, retain NSArray iSelectedIn property nonatomic, retain NSMutableArray records codepre  pstrongInController.mstrongp  precodeimport InController.h  implementation InController  synthesize iSelectedIn, records   IBAction inNextPageidsender      inPageNumber  inPageNumber  1     NSLoginPageNumber called ok     [self updateIn]     IBActionupdateInvoiceidsender      wipe all current records and refresh empty table     [records removeAllObjects]     [inPreviewTable reloadData]     for NSArray s in [[iSelectedIn valueForKeyinJobList] lastObject]          NSString jLT  [s valueForKeyinJT]         NSString jLH  [s valueForKeyinJHo]         NSString jLC  [s valueForKeyinJC]          etc.          if CustomViewPagination called this, records is nil, so nothing          is cleared, and theres no s for iSelectedIn as iSelectedIn          is found to be nil.

I still could not access the functions, either directly via the browser or from the client application via a service reference.p  pThanks in advance for any help with this.p

Negative 905 pIm building a RESTful api using Zend Framework via the ZendRestRoute. For files upload, should I use PUT or POST to handle the process Im trying to be as consistent as possible with the definition of the REST verbs. Please refer to ema hrefhttpjcalcote.wordpress.com20081016putorposttherestofthestoryPUT or POST The REST of the Storyaemp  pThe way I understand this is that I should use PUT if and only if Im updating the full content of the specified resource. Ill have to know the exact URL to PUT to.  On the other hand, I should use POST if Im sending a command to the server to create a subordinate of the specified resource, using some serverside algorithm.p  pLets assume this is a REST api for images upload.  Does that mean I should use POST if server is to manipulate the image files i.e. create thumbnail, resize, etc and use PUT if I just simply save the image raw file to the serverp  pIf I use PUT to handle file upload, should the process be as followp  ol liUser send a GET request to retrieve the specific URL for file to be PUT to.li liThen the user send PUT request to the URL from the GET response. The file being uploaded is raw exactly as the user uploaded.li ol  pIm quite new to this stuff so hopefully Im making sense here...p  pIf you know the best way to do this, feel free to comment as well.p

Negative 905 pI am using EF4 with code first and have a repository for persistence and a service layer that interacts with it.

Negative 905 pNot sure if anyone has had this..p  pMy custom markers display fine in my mapping application, no problems with this, with one exceptionp  pWhen moving to different zoom levels, the marker itself doesnt move as such but appears to be wrong in relation to the tiles of the google map.p  pFor example if anyone knows the UK Map I have a marker that sits just to the left of the M1 motorway when zoomed in up close. When zooming out how ever to say a more global overview of the UK, the icon itself appears on the right of the M1  but no processing is happening to the markers during this phase  so it cannot be the marker moving.p  pIs this actually down to googles map images being slightly different at higher zoom levels, or is there something in the markers side of things that can affect thisp  pLike I said  everything IS working, it just seems a bit strange zooming in and seeing the map tiles change position slightly whereas the marker remains constantp  pCheersp
Negative 905 pIm trying to run a web server using the following invocationp  prunjetty handler host hostname port 8080p  pThis starts a server which I can access from the same host, but not externally.

Negative 905 pin Unix, what I want to do is history  grep keyword, just because it takes quite some steps if i wanna grep many types of keywords, so I want it to be automation, which I write a Perl script to do everything, instead of repeating the commands by just changing the keyword, so whenever I want to see those certain commands, I will just use the Perl script to do it for me.p  pThe keyword that I would like to grep is such as source, ls, cd, etc. It can be printed out in any format, as long as to know how to do it. p  pThanks I appreciate any comments. p
Negative 905 pStarting with one Java baseinterface, I want others to be able to extend this interface, directly or indirectly, and add bean properties and behavior to it, as a plugin system.p  pThen, strongat runtimestrong, on the user computer, I would find all those interfaces and generate a single big class that implements them all. The fields required for the bean properties would be generated automatically, while the behavior defined in the interfaces would be implemented as static methods of an helper class created by the plugin developers that take the appropriate interface as first parameter, so the implementation of the interface method would delegate to a static method, passing this as first parameter.p  pThis is similar to how Scala implements its traits.p  pI see 3 ways of doing thisp  ol liUse Javas dynamic proxies, which are based on reflection.li liGenerate the sourcecode as a string, and compile it at runtime.li liUse some bytecode manipulation library to generate the class at runtime.li ol  pOption 1 is the easiest, but least efficient, and therefore I want a better solution. Option 2 would give me an efficient implementation, but is rather ugly.p  pWhile I have seen several libraries that can do option 3, they all seem to require that I learn Javas assembler language first, which I take as a very timeconsuming activity, with little benefits in the end..p  pSince I dont want to learn any assembler, JVM or otherwise, is option 2 my best bet, or are there libraries that can generate dynamic proxies without me using JVM assemblerp

Negative 905 pIm using SlimDX, targeting DirectX 11 with shader model 4. I have a pixel shader preProc which processes my vertices and saves three textures of data.

Negative 905 pI am developing an iPhone application. I have my code implemented this wayp  pRootViewController has UIScrollView as its view. Then RootViewController pushes another UIViewController say vc which again has UIScrollView sv as its view.p  pThe boundsframe size of sv is 320, 460 and content size is 320, 520. So, sv is now scrollable vertically. Hence, I have set content offset of sv to be 0, 60.p  pI switch to background using Home button of iPhone and again put my application to Foreground. In this case my sv content offset is set to 0, 0 automatically with animation.p  pWhen I tried to override setContentOffset I noticed that some library call [adjustsIfNeeded], sets content offset to be 0, 0.p  pCould someone me tell me why is this happeningp  pThanks and Regards, Deepap

Negative 905 pSo here is the whole story. I have done alot of code for a lot of platforms.  I really like the concept that I have found in Java and .NET with a resource file that can contain all the strings you will use in your app. Hopefully some of you know about it.

I may be wrong.p  pSo what we want is, we have a whole bunch of strings that get repeated in multiple places alert boxes, direction text, etc.. We need that to be a change once kind of experience. There are multiple ways of doing this, I just dont know which one is the best.p  pIm not really eloquent, so if anyone has questions or needs clarification, let me know. p

This triples the   number of roundtrips needed for the request and introduces the   possibility for a race condition. With strongReadThroughstrong support turned on   AppFabric itself makes the secondary call to slow storage. AppFabric   gains this ability via a custom implementation of the abstract class   DataCacheStoreProvider.p blockquote  pThe strongWhats Nextstrong section of 3 seems to suggest that its notp  blockquote   pIn addition, the success of the Caching session state provider   scenarios with ASP.NET has resulted in requests for the ability to   associate writebehind and readthrough queries with the cache so that   the cache can become the primary way to manipulate data, while letting   the associated queries update the data tier in the back end.p      pWell be evaluating these and other features for possible inclusion in   future releases of Windows Azure AppFabric Caching. In the meantime,   we encourage you to experiment with the current Caching service   implementation and let us know how it works for you.p blockquote  pIs there any other mechanism for programmatically a invalidating and b replacing a cached page without letting it naturally rehydrate through client requests which can potentially cause issues under load, as all requests race to rehydrate the elementp  pOther documented differences w Windows Server 4p  blockquote   pstrongASP.NET Cachingstrongp      pWindows Azure AppFabric provides both a session state provider and an   output cache provider. This provider differs from the one that shipped   with the first release of Windows Server AppFabric. It also provides   additional features. Because of this, it is important to carefully   follow the instructions for modifying the web.config file correctly   for Windows Azure AppFabric. For more information, see Using the   ASP.NET 4 Caching Providers for AppFabric.p      pstrongUnavailable Caching Featuresstrongp      pWindows Azure AppFabric supports a subset of the caching features   available in Windows Server AppFabric. The following list describes   some of these differences.p      pstrongNotificationsstrongp      pNotifications are not supported in Windows Azure AppFabric Caching.   This also means that you cannot use notifications to invalidate the   local cache. In Windows Azure AppFabric, local cache can use only a   timeout based invalidation policy. For more information about the   notifications feature in Windows Server AppFabric, see Cache   Notifications Windows Server AppFabric Caching.p      pstrongExpiration and Evictionstrongp      pBy default, items in a Windows Azure AppFabric cache do not expire.   This means that when you exceed your maximum cache size, the least   recently used items in the cache are evicted. Unlike Windows Server   AppFabric, there is no way to change this default expiration setting   or value. However, if you add items to the cache with an explicit   expiration time, such as 10 minutes, then the cache will honor this   expiration value. This can be done with various overloads of the Add   and Put methods. Note that the ASP.NET providers automatically use   these overloads to provide explicit timeouts for session state and   output caching.p      pWindows Azure AppFabric Caching does not support disabling eviction on   a cache. Under memory pressure, it is always possible that items could   be evicted. Applications should be designed to anticipate that items   might be missing and require reloading at any time. If a cache is too   small for the application requirements, it can be dynamically   increased from the Windows Azure Platform Management Portal.p      pFor more information on expiration and eviction in Windows Server   AppFabric, see Expiration and Eviction Windows Server AppFabric   Caching.p      pstrongHigh Availabilitystrongp      pWindows Azure AppFabric Caching does not support the high availability   feature. For more information about high availability in Windows   Server AppFabric, see High Availability Windows Server AppFabric   Caching.p      pstrongRegions and Tagsstrongp      pWindows Azure AppFabric Caching does not support usercreated regions   or tagbased searches.p      pstrongAPI Supportstrongp      pIn most cases, you can use the same APIs to write cache clients that   use Windows Azure AppFabric or Windows Server AppFabric. There are   some exceptions due to differences between the two solutions.

Negative 905 pA thought experimentp  blockquote   pYou have a CMS that allows users to upload an image, and each page is stored as a row in the database.

Could you recommend a course of action  Thank youp

Im pretty sure that there is a middle ground to be reached that is the most efficient code.p  pThe code above has two points of inefficiency. The first is how it connects to the database in the first place. The second is once the data is returned, how do you deal with it.

Negative 905 pIn the past, Ive always created a database class and in that class assigned a connection attribute the connection via mysqlconnect in a construct method.

Negative 905 pIve got some a basic framework for a webapp some static pages, user authentication, basic testing with rpec.  Id like to use this as a foundation for future webapps.  Ive named my project framework, so if I fork it, Ill have about a dozen instances where I have to replace the term Framework with the name of the new app Im creating.  This project is as a hrefhttpsgithub.combnd5kframework relnofollowgithub.combnd5kframeworka.  The README file contains a list of the files where I need to make the change. I can make those changes by hand by hand, but Id prefer to automate this process.  I figure that the easiest thing to do would be to include a rake file in Framework. So, I created rake file called renamer.rake.  My rake file is based on this post a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1274605rubysearchfiletextforapatternandreplaceitwithagivenvalueRuby Search file text for a pattern and replace it with a given valuea.  Heres what I came up with.p  precodetask rename do    filenames  [configenvironmentstest.rb, configenvironmentsproduction.rb,      configenvironment.rb]   filenames.each do filename     text  File.readfilename     puts text.gsubFramework, funktrunkgunk   end end codepre  pThis code works insofar as it replaces the term framework with a different term, but it only does to in the console.   I need it to actually change the contents of the files. What do I need to do Do I need to open the each file instead of just read itp  pFYI this code only lists a few files just so I can test out whether this method works and the replacement term will ultimately be a variable, not funktrunkgunk.  Once I get this part down, Id like to have it setup so that anyone can clone the framework repo to their machine, cd into the framework directory, start rails server, then go to local host on their browser to rename the file from there.  Ill setup publicindex.html to be a basic page that contains a form field where the user can enter their own name for the app.  Once the user clicks a Name App button , itll run the rake file.  Does that sound feasiblep

Negative 905 pI am trying to load a shared library using     System.loadLibrarysharedC sharedC is dependent on 2 other shared libraries sharedA and sharedB, all three were made using the standalone toolchain and are included as prebuilt shared libraries.  I load sharedA and sharedB before sharedC and I know of no other dependencies.  But when I try to load sharedC, I get a SEGV.  When I run strace, this is what I getp  precodewritev3, [3, 1, dalvikvm0, 9, Trying to load lib datadatacom.exa mple.hellojniliblibsharedC.so 0x44e8ce28n0, 83], 3  93

I tried looking at the source files noted, but even tracing all the way back to the c source didnt shed any light.p  pI am running python 2.6.7 from Cygwin on Windows 7 64bit. If I run this from cmd through my native windows python, i.e. not from Cygwin, the problem does not occur.p  pUPDATE Looking more closely at the source, it looks like the CreateSemaphore C function takes in a name parameter, and if a semaphore with this name already exists, then an error codeERRORALREADYEXISTScode will be flagged. However, in the python source in Modulesmultiprocessingsemaphore.c, this function is called without a name parameter, so this should not happen.

In addition, once the constructor has succeeded once, it will not fail again for the rest of the iterations of the for loop. p  pI am still stumped I have tried playing with gc.collect, time.sleep, calling close or del on the queue itself, and none of these seem to have any impact. If this is indeed a problem with the operating system cleaning up semaphores, is there anyway to force this to happen via a system callp

Negative 905 pThere is a medium size database application that needs to be built featuring a web interface. The platform is asp.net 3.5 asp.net mvc 2, sql server and ext.net 1.3.0. The tool is visual studio 2010. p  pI wonder, should I start with the database design and business logic and move on to the UI when Ive a complete working draftskeleton Or should I build the database and BL step by step and bind them to the web UI as I progress p  pEven more specifically, should I construct the whole BL functionality as a separate dll project and then have it referenced by the web application project If so, what communication options do I have web services, for examplep  pLast but not least, the web application requires a security mechanism user accounts etc. Should I design and integrate it right from the start or can I add it when everything else is readyp  pI hope my question is clear enough. As far as I know, creating a dozen or more aspx pages as a means of building and testing the application functionality leads to all shorts of problems and dead ends while being extremely time consuming. What I seek is a way to separate the UI from everything else. Something like having a working prototype to show case to the customer and have the ext.net web UI built later as a completely separate step.p
Negative 905 pWell this might sound easy but to me it is confusing as heck. I have been working on a form to edit an already existing database entry. Some of the fields are created and populated based on records from a joined table.p  pThis sounds a bit sketchy so Ill try to illustrate it. I have a table with content named Content and a table named Files which holds the filenames and locations. I get the filenames based on the content id supplied and then the form creates the fields and these are then populated with the filenames.p  precodepublic function setFilesfiles      i  0     foreach files as file          i         fieldname  encloseditemnamei         thisgtaddElementtext, fieldname, arrayrequired       gt true,                                                         label          gt Enclosed item name test,                                                         value          gt file[fileurl],                codepre  pThis works perfectly fine but now I want to add a button that will allow me to delete ONE of the files. So what I figured is should do is create a codefileDeleteActioncode in the controller and then have the button redirect to that action, have it delete the entry in the database and then render the view with the form.p  pHaving the action render a different view then its standard view, not a problem. Writing the code to delete the entry in the database, not a problem either. Creating a button which redirects to the delete action using the addElements method as a factory... massive problem. This is how far I got.p  precodethisgtaddElementbutton, deleteencloseditemi, array   codepre  pHow do I get this button to redirect to the delete action without it disturbing the submit button at the bottom of my form which is used to submit the form and call to the editAction in my controller.p  pI have looked into using a bit of javascript to detect which button is pressed but I am not at home in javascript yet and am having trouble finding out how to find out which button is pressed since the button name and id are dependant on the setFiles function and thus can range between codedeleteencloseditem1code and codedeleteencloseditem5000code depending on the amount of filenames it pushes into the form.p  pHow can I get this done Any tips or advice is well appreciated p

If I enter an invalid email address and move the mouse cursor outside of the inputText only the codeInvalid email addresscode message appears the UIInput does not switch to the codeinvalidcode class, so no red border appears around the component.  However, if I click the submit button and submit the form with an invalid email address, when the page is reloaded the inputText boxs class changes and I get both the redbordered component as well as the error message.  Why is this so  Doesnt JSR303 require that clientside validation work just the same as if the form were to be submittedp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI added the following to my inputText, which resolved the problem with changing the class on the inputTextp  precode lta4jajax eventblur renderemailgt codepre  pHowever, this introduced a new problem.  Now, the error messages are not sticky.  In other words, when an invalid email is entered the red outline appears on the inputText and the error message appears, as expected, but if I then enter an invalid input on another component and its class changes to invalid and its error message appears, the error message on email disappears.  The inputText class change works fine now, but the messages are volatile, and they disappear if another components entry becomes invalid.p

However, in order to make things to fit better with my application that is, for example, in order to handle things like I18n translations and similar in a programmatic way, I am thinking to add to my application a new emmodelem like the followingp  precodeclass EditorUser lt User  Note the class name and the class inheritance   ... end codepre  pThis way, through my application, I can refer to the codeEditorUsercode class in order to handle article editor user instances as if they were codeUsercode objects... more, since inheritance, in the codeEditorUsercode class I can state specific methods for example, scope methods available only to codeEditorUsercode instances not to codeUsercode instances...p  pemIs it a common approach to make things as I would like to make in my case Is it the Rails Way If so, what I could  should make to handle this situation If no, how could  should I proceedemp  hr  pIn other words, I thought using class codeEditorUser lt User ... endcode because associated codeEditorUsercode objects retrieved by running the codearticle.editoruserscode method are codeUsercode objects. I think that by stating a codeEditoUsercode class in the codeappmodelscode directory or elsewhere could simplify things in my application because you can work around that constant name for example, you can play with that constant name in order to build translation strings or by stating new methods just to be used for codeEditorUsercode instances.p

Negative 905 pI am working in C 4.0 and I have the following problemp  pgiven a finite set S of real numbers and a parameter k NOT NECESSARILY IN THE SET, find strongthe smallest number in S greater than or equal to kstrong.p  pObviously, I could use a balanced binary tree to do so. However, there is no implementation of such data structure in C that could help me. What are the options of algorithms and possible implementations in Cp  pEditp  psince most of people are more interested in criticizing than really helping, I will explain morep  pit is for an algorithm that divides a real function in millions of pieces or bins, like an histogram, and I need to find the piece that contains k in and efficient way to apply some computation in it. The pieces are real intervals of the form [a b and do not overlap.p  pThe method I am designing needs to take the piece, given k, and is performance critical since it should be called thousands of times per second. Therefore, an On search is unacceptable.p  pThe time wasted on building the data structure of S is not important and not critical, since the set will be built only once and will never change it is an immutable set.p  pI know I could use a red black tree, which has Olog n search complexity. However, Id like to investigate other algorithm options and possibly with existing implementations in C.p

Negative 905 pI am a desktop GL developer, and I am starting to explore the mobile world.p  pTo avoid misunderstandings, or welcomebuttrivial replies, I can humbly say that I am pretty well aware of the GL and GLES machinery.p  pThe short question is if we are using GLES 2.0 in a shared memory architecture, whats the point behind using VBOs against clientside arraysbrp  pMore in detailp  ul lipVertex buffers are raw chunks of memory, the driver cannot emin any wayem optimize anything because the access pattern depends on 1 how the application configures vertex data layout, 2 how a vertex shader consumes buffer content, and 3 we can have lots of vertex shaders operating in different ways, and differently sourcing the same buffer.pli lipAlignment individual VBO storage could start at addresses that are optimal to the underlying GL system what if I just force e.g, respect alignment best practices clientside arrays allocation to these boundariespli lipTileBased Rendering vs. Immediate Mode architectures should not come into play to my understanding, this is not related to my question i.e., memory access.pli ul  pI understand that using VBOs can have your code run betterfaster in emfutureem platformshardware without modifying it, but this is not the focus of this question.p  pAlongside, I also realize that using VBOs in a shared memory architecture doubles memory usage if you, for some reason, have to keep vertex data at your disposal, and it costs you a memcpy of the data.p  pAs with interleaved vertex arrays, VBO usage has got a great hype in developers forumsblogsofficialtechnotes without any data supporting those statements i.e., benchmarks.p  ul liIs VBO usage worth it on shared memory architecturesli liDo clientside arrays work wellli liWhat do you thinkknow about thisli ul

Negative 905 pI understand the principle behind the bundling and minification with mvc4, but I would like to use the basic preminified libraries for such items as jquery and other large and common libs. p  pThus, in my production version, instead of referencing a bundle like thisp  precodebundlesjquerymobilevN1H63GRw63057BORWSW60RX5rLWde08XZf8PiKQaE1 codepre  pI would prefer to use the standard jquery min version, like thisp  precodejquery1.8.2.min.js codepre  pThen my next step will be to allow replacing these standardized libs with CDN hosted ones, such as the ones that google and other big cdns make available. p  pSo two parts to this questionp  pHow can I instruct the bundler to directly include a preminified file, unbundled with othersp  pHow can I create a link to a CDN hosted version of this file instead of referencing local onesp

Negative 905 pI am quite new to multithreading, I have a single threaded data analysis app that has a good bit of potential for parallelization and while the data sets are large it does not come close to saturating the harddisk readwrite so I figure I should take advantage of the threading support that is now in the standard and try to speed the beast up.p  pAfter some research I decided that producer consumer was a good approach for the reading of data from the disk and processing it and I started writing an object pool that would become part of the circular buffer that will be where the producers put data and the consumers get the data. As I was writing the class it felt like I was being too fine grained in how I was handling locking and releasing data members. It feels like half the code is locking and unlocking and like there are an insane number of synchronization objects floating around.p  pSo I come to you with a class declaration and a sample function and this question Is this too finegrained Not fine grained enough Poorly thought outp  precodestruct PoolArray  public     Obj arr     uint32 used     uint32 refs     stdmutex locker   class SegmentedPool  public Construction and destruction cut out     void allocuint32 cellsNeeded, PoolPtramp ptr     void deallocPoolPtramp ptr     void clearAll private     void expand      stores all the segments of the pool     stdvectorlt PoolArrayltObjgt gt pools     ReadWriteLock poolLock      stores pools that are empty     stdqueuelt int gt freePools     stdmutex freeLock      int currentPool     ReadWriteLock currentLock   void SegmentedPooldeallocPoolPtramp ptr      find and access the segment     poolLock.lockForRead     PoolArray temp  amppools[ptr.getSeg]     poolLock.unlockForRead     reduce the count of references in the segment     tempgtlocker.lock     tempgtrefs     if the number of references is now zero then set the segment back to unused     and push it onto the queue of empty segments so that it can be reused     iftempgtrefs0              tempgtused0         freeLock.lock         freePools.pushptr.getSeg         freeLock.unlock          tempgtlocker.unlock     ptr.setNULL,1  codepre  pA few explanations First PoolPtr is a stupid little pointer like object that stores the pointer and the segment number in the pool that the pointer came from.p  pSecond this is all templatized but i took those lines out to try to reduce the length of the code blockp  pThird ReadWriteLock is something I put together using a mutex and a pair of condition variables.p

If I write something like p  precode.testhover codepre  pIt returns me p  precode.test, test  codepre  pThe same class name but on with the dot and the other without the dot.  If I write a selector with multiple class name p  precode.test, .hello codepre  pIm getting the same result...Is there anyway to modify my Regex or my code  to obtain all the classes names with the dot . only, considering the user can have a unlimited number of classes in the same selector  p

Negative 905 pIs there a way to distribute a WSGI application that will work out of the box with any server and that will be configurable using the servers builtin features only This means that the only configuration file the administrator would have to touch would be the servers configuration file.

Using codeos.environcode works with Gunicorn and uWSGI but not with modwsgi because codeSetEnvcode doesnt affect codeos.environcode.p

Negative 905 pI am transforming a large xml document with the XSLT engine of Firefox. When this file is too large for Firefox, the browser just freezes much earlier in Mac Os  i7 than in a Windows  core 2 duo, surprising. p  pAs a way to make easier the process, I have splited the xml file in small parts, transforming them serially. This has improved things and velocity a lot. However, when the file is still large, I have the same symptoms.p  pNow, what I think is happening is that the transformToFragment function is asynchronous. It means that I am starting the following transformation before the previous one has finished, and at the end it blocks the browser and actually the computer as well.p  pThen, I cannot find any event that I could rely on before continuing with the process. Does anybody have any idea of how to do itp  pThanksp

Negative 905 pIm learning ObjectiveC, and ran into something which doesnt make sense to me.  p  pWhen we have a view controller VC drawn in Storyboard, you can call this VC via code by entering a string into the Storyboard ID click on the VC in Storyboard, in Utilities sidebar, Identity Inspector tab, Identity section using the instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier method.p  pIn my example, Ive drawn a standalone UIViewController in Storyboard and set Storyboard ID to orderList.  In the code, I can call this view by this code, strongCode1strongp  precodeUIViewController ordersVC  [self.storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifierorderList] codepre  pIf I create a subclass of UIViewController called SCVCOrders, and insert some code into it that modifies how it looks  like setting a title or changing the background color I thought Id be able to use this code strongCode2strong to combine the drawn VC with the code in SCVCOrdersp  precodeSCVCOrders ordersVC  [self.storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifierorderList] codepre  pBut it doesnt combine them.  It only uses what is drawn in the Storyboard.  So next, in Storyboard, I set the drawn VCs class to SCVCOrders.  Now strongCode2strong gives me the combined look, but so does strongCode1strong.  My conclusion from this is that Storyboard is taking precedence over the instantiation code.  Xcode doesnt care what class I code the view to be, it will just look at Storyboard for this.  Is this correctp  pI imagine it would be useful to have ability to layer my code on top of what I draw in Storyboard.  Using my example, Id like to leave my drawn VC as the generic class.  And use strongCode2strong to layer code on top of the drawn VC.  Or how else can we achieve something like thisp

Negative 905 pIm working on a project that has a lot of legacy code that is not covered with tests. p  pIs there any way that I could set up the integration server to check that all new commits have a minimum amount of tests say, coverage is 70p  pEssentially, I see two optionsp  ol liSomehow set up the CI server to fail the build when the committed changes are not covered with unit tests. This will ensure that every piece of new code will have tests and that tests for the legacy code will increase with each change.li liSet a coverage threshold for the whole project and fail the build if the coverage percentage decreases after a commit. The problem with this is that if I delete a class containing 100 instructions and add a new class with 50 instructions the coverage percentage will go up without me writing any tests.li ol  pI like option 1 more because it forces changes in legacy code to be unit tested. This should increase the overall test coverage.p  pRight now were using Jenkins as our CI server and JaCoCo for test coverage. Maven is used for building the project and SVN is our main source control.p

Negative 905 pRight now Im trying to create digit recognition system using OpenCV.

From the table on a hrefhttpyann.lecun.comexdbmnist relnofollowMNIST database sitea I found that people are using emdeskewingem, emnoise removalem, emblurringem and empixel shiftem techniques. Unfortunately almost all links to the articles are broken.

Negative 905 pI was reading a paper about CapacityConstrained Power Diagram, and came across a function written in the form of codeVSi,Wicode. codeVSi,Wicode is the area of the size, codeSicode is the position of the site and codeWicode is weight of the site. I had no idea what relationship it is between the weight and the area. Could it be written in an explicit form like codey  2x  4code Thanks in advance for any idea. p  pThe reason why I need the explicit form is that I got to solve the equation codeVSi,Wi  Ccode for any given codeSicode and codeCcode, and finally code the algorithm 2 proposed in the paper.p

Negative 905 pIve set up NewRelic for a rails application on Heroku. I notice NewRelic is determining the application name from the rails environment definition. This is mediated through the appname variable in the newrelic.yml configuration file. However, I run the same rails environment on disparate Heroku applications, each being used for different development testing or staging purposes. So we entirely emdo notem want all those applications although using the same rails environment to report back to the same NewRelic application. That would provide no value at all in NewRelic  rather, each Heroku application should be its own application in NewRelic, otherwise we just get one useless aggregate for all those applications each running a different source version of our application with different load or test simulations. p  pWhat should be the most straightforward and solid way to configure that separationp  pThanksp  pemP.S. of course for our production environment we do want to have all dynos report back as one NewRelic application. Just not for disparate stagingtest environments.emp

Negative 905 pIm one of these types of people who thinks if it shouldnt be able to change, then it should be codeconstcode. Perhaps I take codeconstcode to the extreme by doing this, but, since my function return types generally should not be able to change, I declare all my functions to return codeconstcode. Unless they return codevoidcode of course  does it even make sense to return by codeconst voidcodep  pYou probably think either Im kind of nutty, and Im wearing out my keyboard typing stuff I dont need to, or that returning const makes sense because you already use it yourself. Or maybe youre thinking neither of those things in which case I guessed incorrectly.p  pIve compiled my program using g4.8, and enabled the compiler switch codeWextracode. When doing so, g warns me that it ignores emevery single oneem of my return statements. None of them are returning by codeconstcode. This makes no difference after compiling obviously, but I wanted to know is there a way of forcing g to compile and pay some attention to my codeconstcode return types.p  pMore importantly, why does g ignore the codeconstcode  or is it simply because Im nutty and g thinks returning codeconstcode is unnecessaryp  pAs requested Example...p  pcodeinline const bool collisionTest...  ... codep  pcodewarning type qualifiers ignored on function return typecodep

Negative 905 pIm working on a multi module maven project with Jenkins. I have a BuildJob which I want to package my project with a unique version number and deploy it to Nexus.p  pThe version number should be  where the mavenversion is the version maintained in the root POM and buildnumber is Jenkins job build number. For example 1.2.31234p  pIm using the mavenversionsplugin to set the desired version number but I have the problem that I want to have the first part of the version 1.2.3 maintained in the POM. So I need a way to extrakt the version from the POM into a Jenkins environment variable. p  pUntil yet I found no direct way of doing this. My solution is to use a groovy script which pares the POM and writes the version number into a temporary property file. After that I use the a hrefhttpswiki.jenkinsci.orgdisplayJENKINSEnvInjectPlugin relnofollowEnvInjecta plugin to create the environment varaible for later reinjecting as version number for the mvn versionsset command.p  pMy groovy scriptp  precodeimport jenkins.util.  def project  new XmlSlurper.parsenew Filepom.xml  def version  project.version.toString def mainversion  version.substring0, version.indexOfSNAPSHOT  println Version mainversion  def versionFile  new Filev.properties versionFile ltlt VERSIONmainversion  codepre  pThis indirection through the property file is very ugly and error prone. Is there any way to directly create an environment variable within the groovy script It is possible using a system groovy script but these kind of scripts are always executed on the master. So my job will not be runable on slaves which doesnt work for me because I do not execute builds on the master.p

Negative 905 pUsing TFS 2013 and Visual Studio 2013 Premium Preview is it possible to take ownership of another persons code review taskp  pThe situation I have is that another developer has requested a code review and then gone on holiday. The code review has been performed and updates are required to the code in light of the review comments. I would like to action the review comments myself before the original developer returns from holiday, but I cant find a way to assign the code review task to myself like I can do with any other work item.p  pObviously I could simply look at the code review comments and action them anyway, but I would have to remember to explain all of this to the returning developer so that they close the review appropriately. It would be so much nicer to be to assign the code review task to myself and action the comments as if I had requested the review in the first place.p

There is no good documentation on this sort of GIS thing.

The creator sent me a nice a hrefhttpsgithub.combrianmcdcontextifywikiWindowsInstallationGuide relnofollowlinka to work around said problem.p  pThis is important, because there is a flag in the command line for topojson in which you can package existing features in geojson into an accessible object in topojson. For example, the above code uses states in topojsonsomething that is meaningless and unaccessible unless you use the following commandp  precodetopojson o us.topojson  statesusstates.json codepre  pThe space between the double hyphen and states is important. You can then access the states via us.objects.states, as shown in the original code above. p

Negative 905 pIm using a Wordpress theme that was developed using Twig template system. I dont know anything about Twig an dont have the time to learn it.p  pSo my question is, in Wordpress we can use codegettermscode to get all the terms from a taxonomy but we can emfilterem the terms we want to receive using an codearraycode of arguments that is the second parameter to the function. p  pThat being said, I have a line in a twig file that goes like thisp  precode for distrito in wp.gettermsDistritos   codepre  pcodedistritocode is my codevariablecode and codeDistritoscode is my taxonomy name. This works, it calls all of the terms, but I want to use the codearraycode arguments so that I can get only the root elements since my taxonomy has hierarchy.p  pI understand that I must have somewhere the place where wp.getterms is defined but I cant find it.p

I am not sure, how to find the actual height and current scroll position.p  p2 This issue is only found in codefirefoxcode. In firefox, scrolling is not smooth as in other browsers. I think this because the above code is creating a infinite loop of scroll events. I am not sure, why this is only happening with firefox. Is there any way to find the source of scroll event, so that I can resolve this issue.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.p

boils down to is something to do with the views not being drawn yet at the time of the first call, but I do not understand why. The view objects at this instant are not null, so why is a NullPointerException raised Clearly there is a hole in my understanding. p  pWhile I can work around the problem with the trycatch block, not understanding why the exception occurs in the first place is going to drive me crazy.

Negative 905 pIn my application I got a codeScrollViewercode, which contains a codeListBoxcode to display codeBorderscode using codeCanvascode.  ListBox codeItemSourcecode is bound to codeObservableCollectioncode, which contains borders.p  pNow I want to zoom to center of codeScrollViewercode.

Negative 905 pIve got some POCO Model classes that Ive setup for use with the Entity Framework. I do some validation in my codeDbContextcodes codeValidateEntitycode override. I return a codeDbEntityValidationResultcode from the codeValidateEntitycode function, and I can see that during runtime I do add some codeDbValidationErrorcodes. I can even see those errors inside of the codeModelStatecode inside of my codeControllercode function, using the following code ...p  precodecatch DbEntityValidationException ex      foreach var entity in ex.EntityValidationErrors              foreach var error in entity.ValidationErrors                      ModelState.AddModelErrorerror.PropertyName, error.ErrorMessage                codepre  pBut for some reason those errors dont show up for the desired property name in the Razor view. I use a view model that looks like the following ...p  precodepublic class CharacterCreateModel      private Character mcharacter      region Properties      public Character Character              get                      return mcharacter                   set                      mcharacter  value                    endregion  codepre  pAnd in my Razor view, which is strongly typed using this codeCharacterCreateModelcode view mode, I just use the standard codeHtml.TextBoxForcode, etc.p  pValidation errors coming from the codeCharactercode model properly display, but validation errors from the codeValidateEntitycode function are not showing up for that property name.p  pAny idea why notp
Negative 905 pIm Working on an application in asp.net in which mouseover should be implemented for all fields, labels and grid view headers. I tried to implement it by using onmouserover option or by using jquery function function mouseover but in this i have to write that function for each in every field. I want to know whether there is a better way to implement this so that we can write only one function which can be called every time when ever mouseover happens. Can any one suggest best way to implement this. I will get the data that has to be displayed for mouseover events from database that is data is stored in a table format which contains field names and the corresponding description that has to be displayed in case of mouseover p

Negative 905 pIve got an Android project that includes references to a library project. The library project contains a resource a renderscript bytecode package. The main project also has its own resources, including a layout, which contains a field that looks like thisp  precode    ltEditText androididideditname gt codepre  pWhen I build my main project in ant, and I call codefindViewByIdR.id.editnamecode at runtime, the call returns the EditText component I expect. But when I clean the projects and build them in Eclipse codefindViewByIdR.id.editnamecode returns codenullcode.p  pDebugging the call shows that my component is present in the View at runtime, and actually has an id assigned, but its not the same id as the value of R.id.editname in this case, the id in R.java and the runtime value of R.id.editname  0x7f070000, whereas the actual View that exists at runtime has mId  0x7f080000p  pWith the ant build, R.java is created with R.id.editname  0x7f080000 which matches the id I observe when running the app.p  pWhen I remove the library dependency in Eclipse, R.java contains R.id.editname  0x7f070000, but so does the runtime, and everything works just fine.p  pI realize one good answer is to file a bug report with ADTEclipse, and use ant to build, but Im developing the library and I want to be sure that it supports Eclipse users. So what Im wondering isp  ul liAre there known bugs in Eclipse that can cause this sort of thing Are there known workaroundsli liIf not, what is the next debugging stepli ul  h2Edith2  pIt turns out this is associated with using a Renderscript asset when I remove the renderscript, the problem disappears both projects use the 07 type tag in their ids. Id still emtotallyem love to hear about a workaround, but for now it looks like custom renderscripts in Eclipse built library projects is a nonstarter. For reference, Im using the latest and greatest Eclipse ADT 22.2.1p

Negative 905 pI have an algorithm which expects a codestdvectorcode call it codeAcode. However, I already have codeBcode with codeN  2codeentries and what I basically want is to pass codeB.data  2code, so the algorithm gets the last codeNcode entries from codeBcode. If codeAcode is modified, then so is codeBcode.p  pWhen using codedoublecode pointers its perfectly clear how I should make it, but is this also possible with codestdvectorcodes I mean, the nice thing with a vector is that it handles the memory for me, and what I want now is to forbid it if codeBcode or codeAcode get destroyed, they should leave the pointed data untouched.p  pLike thisp  precodestdvectorlt double gt B1,2,3,4,5 stdvectorlt double gt AB.data  2, B.size  2   A and B share data now. A is 3, 4, 5 codepre  pI know that the algorithm could be designed better for this purpose by taking a pair of iterators, but thats not in my hands.p  pemUPDATEemp  pIn the comments, one wished to see the signature, here it isp  precodenloptresult nloptoptoptimizestdvectorltdoublegt ampx, double ampoptf codepre  pHowever, my original intention was to be very clever and let the algorithm optimize direclty in my vector codeBcode, so what I ended up with was something like thisp  precodestdvectorlt double gt BN  2  do something with it here, like put initial values  stdvectorlt double gt A B.begin  2, B.end  optimize A   stdcopyA.begin, A.end, B.begin  2 codepre  pI really dont worry about this workaround, I also read in the documentation of codenloptcode that the vectors are copies internally anyway a number of times if one uses the C interface instead of the C one.p  pBut again, this example really opened my eyes regarding algorithm interface design and that its worth to invest some time browsing through e.g. the boost libraries like coderangecode and so on.p

If using terminal with same echo TRIG  nc 192.168.1.100 23 q1 command, everything works fine. From Qt, it does not work. The debug output is TRIG  nc 10.0.3.250 23 q1 ... so without an echo. My device does not receive the TRIG command.p  pCould you please advise what Im doing wrong Many thanks.p
Negative 905 pI have some doubts about how to make a hbm.xml file for a mapping in Hibernate. The problem comes when mapping a Java object which has fields in several tables.p  pThe custom framework we are using requires to have a hbm.xml file for each object, but in this case its fields are in three tables, so I want to make a native SQL query another requirement from above and move the field values in the result over the new object described in the Hibernate mapping file.p  pMy hibernate mapping file is something likep  precodelthibernatemappinggt ltclass namecom.mycompany.myproject.model.scommons.companhiaalmacen.CompanhiaAlmacen tableCOMPANHIAALMACENgt     ltid namecompanyWarehouseId typejava.lang.Integer accessfieldgt         ltcolumn nameIDEMPRESANAVE gt         ltgenerator classassigned gt     ltidgt     ltproperty namecompanyId typejava.lang.Integergt         ltcolumn nameIDEMPRESA gt     ltpropertygt     ltproperty namewarehouseDCId typejava.lang.Integergt         ltcolumn nameIDCENTRODISTRIBUCIONNAVE gt     ltpropertygt      lt HERE This attribute NOMBRECOMERCIAL belongs not only to another table EMPRESA gt     lt but also to another schema GENERAL as well gt     ltproperty namename typejava.lang.Stringgt         ltcolumn nameNOMBRECOMERCIAL gt     ltpropertygt      ltproperty namecreationDate typejava.util.Dategt         ltcolumn nameFECHAALTA gt     ltpropertygt     ltproperty namecreationUser typejava.lang.Stringgt         ltcolumn nameUSUARIOALTA gt     ltpropertygt ltclassgt lthibernatemappinggt codepre  pI dont know how to make this without making a oneToMany or ManyToOne.

Negative 905 pIm creating a web application with AngularJS and Foundation.p  pThe problem arises when I use the Orbit content slider packed with Foundation. It requires a call to foundations initializing function document.foundation. As I am using an ngview and the AngularJS routing features I have to recall this function every time a new view is loaded. I tried achieving this by putting the call in to the controller function loaded by every route. But I think this causes the script to run too soon right before the images or the actual view is loaded as it doesnt show the orbit slider until I either reload the view or page Im guessing the images have cached by then in the background and can be loaded soon enough. I also tried using the routeChangeSuccess event for calling the foundation function, but this gives me the same result.p  pI also created a directive that binds with the image load event, now even tho this actually works, and the slider shows correctly from the first time loading the view, the foundation call has to be made on pages without images too, plus there is some content flashing when using this approachI can actually see the UL item bullets appear and disappear used by Orbitp  pI just started working with AngularJS so Im not sure what Im doingsaying is entirely correct. p  pI did some research and I read something about promises and resolves that might help me find a solution for this problem, but I havent been able to see how this would be done.p  pThanks in advancep

When I try to decode a string of bits, the message is incorrect because it is only able to do d and a. This had led me to suspect it was the building of the tree.

If I tried to read the board in as straight ints then it would try to read all the digits of a row as one int until a space or a newline was reached, and if I try to read it in char by char with get, I run into problems again with newlines, and I would then have to convert the array of chars to an array of ints for evaluation which I think I will run into problems with as well. This is my code so far, I figured using an istringstream would be convenient but then realized that I would have to have more for loops, so a solution without it would be ideal.

Negative 905 pI am creating a personal information page for a project. This page will be able to submit and update personal information.

My testing revolves around importing data into Excel, but what I really need to do is create a row in a log table.

My guess at this point is that Excel and Access are using the Next Generation encryption engine by default, but that the ADO library has not been updated to use it.p  pIve attached the connection code for review.

Negative 905 pIn a C console application I have a loop that iterates through about 8000 items in a collection, setting about eight strings equal to various properties of the items and then using those strings to perform a big variety of other operations. To keep my code organized Im declaring all of the strings ahead of time and leaving them null until an item is read and the loop sets the appropriate string equal to the appropriate value. My question is, will there be a emnoticeableem performance difference between declaring those strings outside of the loop versus inside I know it will technically eat up some extra clock cycles declaring them each time the loop iterates, and after 8000 iterations that might start to add up, but I have no idea how much or if it will even matter This application already takes a good half hour to complete its full cycle so a couple seconds of difference is insignificant, but if were talking minutes obviously thats a bad thing.p  pPlease keep in mind this is mostly a question of curiosity, I could honestly declare these variables wherever without affecting the application. Im sure best practices state that they should always be outside the loop, but Ive always wondered how much of a difference it really makes in this kind of lowimpact operation.p

Negative 905 pI develop some python applications so I know how to do this in python locally, but am working with some PHP developers I know nothing of PHP who say this cant be done in PHP. This is the idea A php driven remote website which creates  hosts files.

So in my browser I click on a download button which asks me to browse to a local or network folder to download the folders and files to. Currently we are just downloading a single .zip file containing all these files and folders which we have to unzip and manually move, copy paste, etc, very messy and cumbersome.

Negative 905 pIve published an iOS app using a local database stored directly on the users device. What Id like to do for my next app is have a central database on a remote server where users can asynchronously sendreceive data. Im relatively new to web service programming and Im not sure where to start. Ive purchased a server space on a web hosting site and have a MySql databasephpMyAdmin configuration on the server. Im not sure how to handle the server side code. I know well enough that a database should never be exposed publicly over the internet for obvious security reasons. Therefore I need some kind of web service where my iOSAndroid apps can query the service, the web service fetches data and sends it back to the clients in a XML or JSON format. Id like to write the  web service layer in python. Ive done a little research and django seems to be recommended by some for these kinds of things. So, my questions arep  ol liWhat are good resources for making a web service in python on a remote server.li liWhat are the best practices for creatingdebuggingtesting the server side code. Should I try and make a local MySql database and write the server code locally and test and then push it to my remote server when it is finishedli ol  pMy ultimate starting goal is some kind of proof of concept hello world app. Where from my iOS and android devices I can query the remote database going through the service layer and getting data back or inserting data.p  pAny tips or advise would be appreciated. Im a noob in this area but ready to learn.p

Negative 905 pI have a small Java Websocket Servlet running on Tomcat 8.0.5. Usually, it answers every received message immediately.

Negative 905 pstrongSympthomsstrong I have several XBee 24ZB emseries 2em here, and they are hooked up on a PC as the coordinator and on an end device AVR as a router no sleep.p  pWhen sending data in larger amounts, it could happen that the routerend device XBee suddenly freezes the DIN line. It can still communicate over radio, and it can still transmit received data serially to the microcontroller DOUT but ignores DIN.p  pThe XBee is operated in strongtransparentstrong mode, and it also ignores the AT commands  with guard times, no matter how often you try. I made very sure the waveforms are clean, read the VCC is stable with a filtering capacitor, read the manual and datasheets.p  pstrongThe only solution is to RESET the XBee or power cycle of the XBee device.strongp  pstrongBaudratesstrong I tried 111111 and 250000.

Negative 905 pIm using SocketIO on a NodeJS instance with a single connection to a Redis cache.

Negative 905 pI have a log on form. Standard, user, password. I have a button, which starts AJAX request to web service which logs on a user. This is a new part built on top of our old site, which didnt use AJAX nor web services. So after the AJAX call to web service is made, the old function of submitting the form is run.p  pThe crucial part is JavaScript must read login and password values and pass them to web service. It works in all browsers except WebKit based.p  pIn WebKit based browsers the value of the password field I read is always empty. When I change the type of the password input to text  I see my remembered password. But if I try to read its value with JavaScript  its empty.p  pWhen you CLICK on this field  you can read it. But user will click the submit button and the site will break, because it wont be able to use web services and AJAX.p  pOf course you cant click it from JS. No known method works here. I even tried to intercept forms submit event  no joy. I can only read empty value.p  pGood work WebKit crew Great antiAJAX Lets get back to the stone age. Does above really offends you Feel free to further downvote. I feel free to state that change in browser engine which break compatibility with some sites without considerable benefit is a bad choice.p  pAnyway, I ask if anyone has found a workaround for this If you offended by the word hack  Ive just changed it to workaround.p  pHeres test code which shows what Im talking aboutp  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtmlgt ltheadgt ltscript srchttpajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjquery1jquery.min.jsgtltscriptgt ltscriptgt function     form1.onsubmit, functione          console.dirx.val         console.diry.val       ltscriptgt ltheadgt ltbodygt     ltform idform1 actionhttpwww.google.com methodpostgt         ltlabel forxgtLoginltlabelgtltinput idx typetextgt         ltlabel forygtPasswordltlabelgtltinput idy typepasswordgt         ltinput typesubmit valueSubmitgt     ltformgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pTo test it run it from hard disk on Chrome with console. Do not test it from JSFiddle, because it wont work at all from there. Remember to check Preserve log upon navigation option. Enter 123 as Login and 456 as Password. Click Submit button. Answer Yes to ...remember password... question. You should see 123 and 456 on console. Run the test again. Do not touch remembered login and password fields. Result should be as expected 123 and 456. Run the test again. Enter codeform1.submitcode in console and press enter. The console output will be 123 and .p  pSo heres the challenge. Rip 456 from Chrome.p  pTo helpful downvoters Ive done my homework like reading similar topics on SO and other websites, Ive tried many theoretical workarounds myself. I dont ask anyone to do my job for me. Im stuck and left a challenge for fellow coders  hackers. Of course whitehat ones p  pMAIN UPDATEp  pToday Ive tested my test code again. Now it works which is just unbelievable Now the very same webkit based browsers return 456 as nonwebkit ones. And I didnt even restart my PCp  pHowever the problem remains, because some of our clients still report problems with our logon form on Chrome. If its a feature, not bug, why does it behave so erratic And as a hypothetical bad guy  why am I still able to read the password when I click it or just change the field type to text from password The only thing I cant do as a legitimate website developer is send the password to my WCF web service without requiring my user to click the password field first, which is pure nonsense. The unsafe thing is storing the sensitive password AT ALL in the first place. But the user has the choice whether to store the password or not. And I hope it will stay this way.p  pThere must be a workaround for this and Ill find it the same way, how smart developers found workarounds to make AJAX uploads possible, and JSONP when browsers didnt support CORS yet, as this was a weird whim for some back in the days. Or youre better and find it before me  Winwin, anyway.p

Negative 905 pI was debugging some blurclick event handling and discovered that using breakpoints or alert popups to debug event handling can block other events from being handled. Ive provided a jsfiddle with 2 input fields. One input field has a blur event handler that alerts when called. If you click the input field to gain focus, and then click the button, the button will trigger an alert popup UNLESS the input field you chose has the blur handler. The action of the blur handler seems to stop the click handler from even happening.p  pI have discovered that the same thing occurs when using breakpoints. Using breakpoints in place of the alerts has the same effect. Breaking in the middle of the blur will prevent the click handler from even being called.p  pIs something going terribly wrong What would be a good way to stop this from happeningp  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netstconradvtka7tt3 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netstconradvtka7tt3ap  precode.text.blurfunctione     var x  0   .text2.blurfunctione     alertblurred   button.clickfunction    alertclicked   codepre

Im not sure how to hide this box without affecting all the other filters in column headers since Kendo doesnt put an ID on them. p  pAlso, the Filter and Cancel buttons get blocked by the drop down when the user clicks in the Select Values block, which means they have to click their selections, then click back above the drop down to close it, thereby making the buttons visible again.p  pBest case scenario is I would like to hide the logic box, for only this column, and move the submit buttons above the drop down box, so they are visible while its open. Im still a pretty green javascripter, not to mention using a library like Kendo where so much is done automagically, so Ive been floundering a bit. p  pAny help would be greatly appreciatedp
Negative 905 pI have several arrays that Im plotting a histogram of, like sop  precodeimport numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  x  np.random.normal0,.5,1000 y  np.random.normal0,.5,100000  plt.histx,y,normedTrue codepre  pOf course, however, this normalizes both of the arrays individually, so that they both have the same peak.  Im looking to normalize them to the total number of elements, so that the histogram of codeycode will be visibly taller than that of codexcode.  Is there a handy way to do this in matplotlib or will I have to mess around in numpy  I havent found anything about it.p  pAnother way to put it is that if I were instead to make a cumulative plot of the two arrays, they shouldnt both top out at 1, but should add to 1.p

Negative 905 pIm facing a migration problem on the job. Right now we have a single database which is used by our website and by a backoffice tool. As part of trying to improve our code in the website, weve desgined a new schema for several tables in the database. p  pAs an example lets take the products table. Its fairly standard with fields like description, name, product code, price, creation date etc. We now have a new table, lets call it betterproducts. The problem is, we can change the website code all we want, but we cant touch the backoffice tools code which relies heavily on the old products table. p  pWere going to end up in a situation in production where the backoffice tool is writing to the old products table, and the website is reading from the new betterproducts table. The question is, how do we keep both of them in sync Ive been googling around for some time now, and by far the most common solution is to use triggers, and map the incoming data to the new table. Ive written the AFTER INSERT trigger for the products, but when I went to write the UPDATE trigger it turned out theres no way to iterate over the fields that changed inside the trigger and map them over. This means writing out the fields by hand a la IF NEW.fieldName lt OLD.fieldName THEN which is ugly and requires listing the fields out by hand. p  pIs there a better way a semibetter way anything except writing this out field by field Is there a better practice than using triggersp  pPlease dont suggest changing the backoffice tool as this is not a realistic option right now. Its planned, but not soon enough for us to be able to wait for it. p
Negative 905 pMy intention is to generate a forecast using a GARCH1,1 using data from an expanding window. Everyday a new return enters the dataset and I will redo the GARCH fit and forecast.

Two ways two do this are apply.fromstart and rollapplyr. p  pIn the code below I decide to start the rolling calculation after at least 100 returns are collected since this is the minimum amount of data that is required by ugarchforecast to perform a forecast. p  pThe last two lines call myFit an starting with a window of 100 they apply the function on an expanding window.

Unfortunately only the first value is the same then the forecast are not aligned anymore.  p  precodelibraryquantmod libraryPerformanceAnalytics libraryrugarch sourceDropboxmyFit.R  symbolLst lt cGSPC,VIX startDate  as.Date20040101 endDate  as.Date20040601 myForHorizon  22 myLag  10  myData lt new.env  getSymbolssymbolLst, env  myData, src  yahoo, from  startDate, to  endDate  args  eapplymyData,                functionxOHLCx  mydata  do.callcbind,                   args,                   envir  myData  mydataReturn lt ClClmyDataGSPC  mydataReturn[is.namydataReturn] lt 0  spec  ugarchspec   variance.modellistgarchOrderc1,1  forecastVec1 lt apply.fromstartmydataReturn, FUNmyFit, gap  100 forecastVec2 lt rollapplyrmydataReturn, width  seq100, 104, 1, FUNmyFit codepre  pThis is myFitp  precodemyFit lt functionmyVector    libraryrugarch   myVec lt myVector   tryCatch    fit  ugarchfitspecspec, datamyVec   forecast  ugarchforecastfit, n.aheadmyForHorizon   myForecast  sigmaforecast[myForHorizon,]  sqrt252  100   printmyForecast   returnmyForecast , warning  functionwarn FALSE, error  functionerr FALSE     codepre  pThese are the elements of forecastVec1 so the forecasts when apply.fromstart is used p  precode[1] 12.35142 [1] 12.1961 [1] 12.45849 [1] 11.95578 [1] 12.08832 codepre  pand these are the elements of forecastVec2 using rollapplyrp  precode[1] 12.35142 [1] 12.15684 [1] 12.10457 [1] 11.89805 [1] 11.94493 codepre  pAs said only the first element is the same.

Negative 905 pWe have a tool in our C codebase that will output EEG float values into Tabbed delimited text.

Negative 905 pI work for a company that uses active directory for all computers. Everyone also has a AD user account but this does not mean that they use it all the time. Some users only use them for certain applications. For the most part, all general users just use a generic login out in the work areas. p  pI am new to MVC and I am trying to learn to do everything the proper way. I currently have an application that was written in JAVA that I need to convert to asp.net mvc.

If so, maybe someone can graciously point me in the right direction.p  pAny help is greatly appreciated. Thank you all.p

Negative 905 pWe are writing a unit testing framework using MSTest so that we can test the AIF framework integration project we have.p  pWe couldnt figure out a way to use mocks so our solution to this was to take a snapshot of the database at the start of the unit tests, then restore and dispose of it at the end using assembly initialise and cleanup.p  pOur test structure then makes a log on call to AX to create the data we need then log off and dispose. We then arrange the data we need and push it through the AIF service.p  pBy the time we get to restoring the snapshot it falls over and says that it is not able to restore the database while other users are using the database. even though we are cleaning up the service after its use. We can solve this by running another SQL query before it which loops through all the sessions and kills them apart from the current one. This allows the DB to restore correctly but because we are not gracefully closing the sessions the AX Service thinks there is a problem and turns itself off which as you can imagine isnt very usefulp  pSo we have a catch 22 situation here.p  pI havent included any code in here because I dont think it would help any but if you think it will then let me know.p  pPlease help me I am literally at the end of my tetherp

Negative 905 pMy issue is that I have created a working CodePen that demonstrates my idea perfectly. When implementing the code on the web server it stops working correctly.p  pSpecifically, my checkboxes should only allow one checkbox to be checked at a time. When the user attempts to check more than one, it unchecks the most recent, and gives an alert. It does this by checking for the checked property when the function is called. Depending on the property, a point is added or subtracted from the checkbox counter. Following, the checkbox counter is checked to ensure only one is selected  otherwise, it subtracts a point and unchecks the most reset checkbox.  p  pWhen demonstrating on the web server, clicking each box subtracts from the checkbox counter. This in turn only allows for a constantly downward counting counter  no check really going on.p  pSo my question Why does the checkbox seem to ignore the fact that it is checkedp  pstrongHTMLstrongp  precodeltdiv idcontainergt   ltinput idthisone classchk typecheckbox value1gt   ltlabel forthisonegtHaltlabelgt   ltinput idthatone classchk typecheckbox value1gt   ltlabel forthatonegtMwahaltlabelgt   ltinput idthishere classchk typecheckbox value1gt   ltlabel forthisheregtHiltlabelgt   ltinput idthatthere classchk typecheckbox value1gt   ltlabel forthattheregtHelloltlabelgt   ltdivgt lth3gtlth3gt codepre  pstrongJSstrongp  precodevar DATA     incomeChecks 0     function incomeChecke    h3.textincome check, launched.

Negative 905 pAs an experiment I was trying to use Guavas AbstractScheduledService for a cleanup Service which will run every 2 minutes. The cleanup is a long running operation which can take several minutes to complete and I need the Service to shutdown without waiting for runOneIteration to finish something similar to triggerShutdown in AbstractedExecutionThreadService.  The Service could potentially take longer than the delay between each run, I am using the p  precodenewFixedDelaySchedulelong initialDelay, long delay, TimeUnit unit codepre  pto prevent multiple cleanups happening concurrently and ensure cleanups happen every 2 minutes. p  precodeOverride protected void runOneIteration throws Exception    cleanup Long blocking call. I would like stopAsync to kill this execution in the middle of a cleanup.  codepre  pEverything works great until I want to shutdown the Service while Im in the middle of a cleanup. Unfortunately, I have to wait until the cleanup is complete before the Service is complete. This is not desirable. I have an alternative implementation using an AbstractExecutionThreadService and an implementation of triggerShutdown to stop cleanup in the middle if necessary.p  precodeOverride protected void triggerShutdown    killCleanup kills cleanup fast  codepre  pThis implementation works great and things shutdown as expected but I think the code makes more sense and is easier to read using the AbstractScheduledService. p  pDoes anyone have any strategies for breaking out of a long running runOneIteration similar to triggerShutdown Im wondering if it would be worthwhile to add a triggerShutdown function to AbstractSheduledService It seems like an important feature that is missing.p

Negative 905 pI need to deal with several war files deployed in several servers in several independent environments. We use Jenkins to build the wars, that are generated by Grails based on code downloaded from a git repo. The wars are deployed in tomcat. The tomcat management page shows a Display name for each war. I want to modify that display name at build time with some identifier of the build, so I can poll the Display Name from all tomcat servers and detect if there are any wars with versions out of sync. p  pI undertand that the Display name is set between codeltdisplaynamegtcode tags in the codeWEBINFweb.xmlcode file. p  pSo my question is is there any Jenkins plugin to modify the codeweb.xmlcode codeltdisplaynamegtcode value after a war is generated or any existing tool that I can use to just modify that particular value of a given war file so I can run it from Jenkins as a last build step, pasing it the codeBUILDIDcode. Any other options are welcome of course.p

Negative 905 pI have a black box C function which I dont have access to its source codep  precodevoid blackboxvectorltintgt ampinput codepre  pThis function modifies the element of the input vector in an unknown manner.p  pThe problem I have now is that I want to apply the black box function only for a partial segment of a vector, for example, the last 500 elements of a vector. So, this is the routine that I wrote to attain this goalp  precodevectorltintgt foo 5,1000 vectorltintgt bar foo.end500,foo.end  blackboxbar  swaprangesfoo.end500,foo.end,bar.begin codepre  pThis code may work, but is there a better way to do thisp  pIt would be good if I can define a vector reference only for a segment of an existing vector, instead of creating a copy. I am not so comfortable with the copying and swapping parts in the above code since this routine is invoked so frequently, I think the repeated copying and swapping slows down the code. If I knew the exact operations done by the block box, I would rewrite the function so that it takes vector iterators as the input arguments. Unfortunately, this is not possible at the moment.p

Negative 905 pI am currently testing a DSCHX400.  While I am able to do almost everything I need to with the camera there are a couple of items that are not exposed via the API that have frustrated my efforts.p  p1 The camera does not seem to offer an option, via the API or the camera itself, to capture images in RAW format.  It does offer standard amp fine JPEG format but both of those are leaving artifacts in the image that become extremely noticeable when you zoom in with an image editor.  Is there a way to get the camera to capture RAW images  I do not need the SDK to return the data just to save it out to the card.  If getting the RAW data is impossible has anyone found an inventive way to clean up the artifactsp  p2 The camera supports both still shoot and movie mode but the API will only expose the mode that I am currently in.  It makes it impossible to transition between still to movie mode to allow recording from the API but I can do that same transition by pressing a single button on the camera.  Once I am recording a movie the API will allow me to transition back to still mode by cancelling recording.  Is there plans to support the ability to trigger a movie recording via the API if you are in a still capture mode Seeing the firmware already supports this functionality  p

Negative 905 pI writing a C application that makes use of a C static Lib. I have wrapped the Lib in a .dll but have run into a problem.

Not logging out takes the program to run to completion.p  pThe runclass.out has the following errorp  precodeTraceback most recent call last                                                 File .runclass, line 84, in ltmodulegt                                           waittilfreecheckseconds                                                    File .runclass, line 53, in waittilfree                                      while busy                                                                  File .runclass, line 40, in busy                                               kmnsprocs  subprocess.checkoutput[ps, a, ocomm].splitlines     File usrlib64python2.7subprocess.py, line 573, in checkoutput               raise CalledProcessErrorretcode, cmd, outputoutput                        subprocess.CalledProcessError Command [ps, a, ocomm] returned nonzero exit status 1                                                                codepre  pWhat is wrong with my nohupp  pMany thanksp  pNote that my command works without exiting, so I dont quite understand the problem.p  pBtw here is the programp  precodeusrbinpython  import os import os.path import sys  ncpus  8 datadir  data  double quotes preferred to allow for apostrophes ndatasets  100 checkseconds  1 basetries  100  gs  [0.001, 0.005, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1] trueks  [4, 7, 10] ps  [4, 10, 100] ns  [10, 100]   times k left 1000 out, would be too much shapes  [HomSp] methods  [Ma67]   def busy      import subprocess     output  subprocess.checkoutputuptime, shellFalse     words  output.split     sys.stderr.writesnoutput      try         kmnsprocs  subprocess.checkoutput[ps, a, ocomm].splitlines     except subprocess.CalledProcessError as x         printps returned , time to quit.formatx         return     kmnswrds  0     procs  [runkmeans, AdjRand, BHI, Diag, ProAgree, VarInf, R]     for i in procs         kmnswrds  kmnsprocs.counti      wrdswords[9]     ldavgfloatwrds.strip,0.8     sys.stderr.writes snldavg,kmnswrds     return maxldavg, kmnswrds gt ncpus   def waittilfreemyseconds     while busy         import time         import sys         time.sleepmyseconds  if True     for method in methods         for shape in shapes             for truek in trueks                 for p in ps                     for n in ns                         actualn  ntruek                 for g in gs                             fnmprfix  sKspsnsgsshape,truek,p,n,g                             fname  sx.datfnmprfix                             for k in range2truek2[22truek2]                                 ofprfix  sksfnmprfix,k                                 ntries   actualnpkbasetries                                 ofname  sestkclasss.datdatadir,ofprfix,                                 if os.path.isfileofname                                     continue                                 else                                      waittilfreecheckseconds                                     mycmd  nice ..kmeansrunkmeans  s N s n s p s K s D s X s i estkclasss.dat t estktimestime.dat z estktimesitime.dat w estkwssswss.dat  e estkerrorserror.dat c estkmusMu.dat m s ampndatasets,ntries,actualn,p,k,datadir,fname,ofprfix,ofprfix,ofprfix,ofprfix,ofprfix,ofprfix,method                                     sys.stderr.writesnmycmd                                     from subprocess import call                                     callmycmd, shellTrue codepre
Negative 905 pI am somewhat new to building web forms without having a series of pages. I have in the past been a PHP programmer, now that I am starting to use some javascript technologies as well such as communicating with my PHP document via AJAX, I am running into a problem.p  pSo I have a series of forms all on one page that is used for making a pizza for an online ordering website.  The form in general is working and I am able to pull POST data from the forms to store into sessions. My problem is that on the second last form, the user selects the toppings they want on their pizza.  Then the last form uses those toppings to populate a list that uses a jQuery sortable script so that the user can sort their toppings into the left side, whole, or right side of their pizza. The problem is that since all these forms are on one page, the page loads the sessions variables right from the original page load and by the time they get set from the user choosing the toppings, they have already been loaded into the page so they dont refresh. So basically when I refresh the page manually by the browser, the jquery sortable form always shows the toppings I choose the LAST time I choose them before refreshing the page.. Basically I need to Update the sessions when the user chooses their toppings and push the updates to the already loaded form.p  pHere is a code sectionp  precodeltphp sessionstart gt codepre

Negative 905 pSorry if this question sounds stupid. I understand that Riak is eventualconsistent and not atomic, so conflicts need to be handled somehow, either by Riak or by the application. However, I cant seem to figure out how to avoid key conflicts.p  pFor example, say I have an object with key codeapplecode in Riak. How to prevent any emcreationem of new objects with that key to succeed There seems to only have codeupdatecode operation, but not codecreatecode. What happens if I create a brand new object with the codeapplecode key and write that to Riak  will that simply overwrite the existing copy That sounds very scary.p  pAlso what happens when two concurrent emcreationsem happen for the same key That is, two completely irrelevant objects are written to riak, both wanting to have the codeapplecode key. Will one of them fail, and howp  pThanksp

Negative 905 pIm working on a project and Im stumped. I have 2 websites that take orders. The databases are on the same server. Each website stores the order data into tables in separate databases. The primary site uses dbo.Orders, which is the  table that is used to give data to our aspdotnetstorefront backend. Our sales people use this interface to review orders. The secondary site usesdbo.orders, which is the table used to store orders. The second sites orders are not accessible on the aspdotnetstorefront. My job is to merge the orders from the secondary site into the table for the primary site so the orders can be seen on the aspdotnetstorefront backend like the orders from the primary site. I also have to create an identifier so when viewed the sales people will know which site the order was from. I think creating a temporary table and maybe an outer join or merge Problem is the tables have no matching fields. Any suggestions would be appreciated.p

Negative 905 pIm working with a Database First model with Entity Framework 5.p  pIn particular, we have one table with a list of predefined categories that are used as reference to a second table of items.p  precodeTABLE ITEM lots of fields integer categoryid  TABLE CATEGORY integer categoryid string name string description codepre  pThe table with the categories is populated initially and will not be modified unless there is a change in the requirementsp  pThe category for each object is calculated inside the code and returns a codeCategorycode object for each codeItemcode object passed to a class written for that purpouse. This class does not need to use the objects in the CATEGORY TABLE, because they are known in advance. It is basically something like thisp  precodevar calculatedCategory  Categorizer.calculateCategoryForitemToCategorize itemToCategorize.category  calculatedCategory codepre  pstrongQUESTIONstrongp  pI want to find the most transparent way to work with the entities when I am calculating the codeCategorycode for an codeItemcode whatever I want to use the category inside or outside a DbContext. The method to returns a codeCategorycode object instead of just a codeStringcode to make a proper use of the entities even in a dettached scenario, but this category can just be created on the fly inside the method because it knows the name, wich is the important field.p  pThe key point here is how to make it transparent to whoever uses this codeCategorizercode to avoid possible duplicated insertions besides during runtime enforcing some constrain in the DB.p  pThe solution I am using right now is passing a collection of codecategoriescode to the constructor of the codeCategorizercode, so it can use them when they are actual references in the database. When I just want to calculate it whithout any database operation involved, I just create a collection of this codeCategoriescode dettached. However this is an additional duplicity and cumbersome, and feels very wrong.p  pI would like something that could be used like thisp  precodeusing var ctx  new context      var itemToCategorize  getItemSomeHow     var calculatedCategory  Categorizer.calculateCategoryForitemToCategorize     itemToCategorize.category  calculatedCategory     ctx.SaveChanges  codepre  pInstead of something like thatp  precodeusing var ctx  new context      var itemToCategorize  getItemSomeHow     var calculatedCategory  Categorizer.calculateCategoryForitemToCategorize     Code that searches for the matching category in the DB ...     itemToCategorize.category  matchingCategory     ctx.SaveChanges  codepre  pand avoid the returned codeCategorycode to be inserted as a new one in the database, and just update the reference of the codeItemcode to the right preexisting codeCategorycodep  pIm thinking in two approaches p  ol liOverride some methods in the model to do this verification and avoid inserts in the database in the Category table.li liModify the database to remove the categoryid and use the name field as primary key the problem here is that Im not an expert in databases and I dont know the effects in the preformance of this, as the ITEMS TABLE can be hugeli ol

There is no indication of how the config properties set in codeconfig.phpcode ever get to the JS code  as far as I can see there is no connection at all and no mention of any other PHP files, even though some are provided but not documented.p  pThis makes no sense  PHP can quite happily generate HTML and JS that is run on the page, which is all the old codeCreateHTMLcode function did. I dont understand why there is no mention of this mechanism since it was how we were supposed to use CKFinder previously  its as if the migration guide is for some unrelated packagep  pIf I update the config file and use the default JS widget code as suggested, it breaks the page completely, altering the MIME output type so it does not get rendered as HTML and appends this errorp  precodeerrornumber10,messageInvalid command. codepre  pThe docs cover various fine details of what PHP config settings mean, but nowhere that Ive found says how its ever loaded, triggered or associated with the JS.

Negative 905 pI have a very weird situation on my hands and Im not sure how to fix it. I will say that I am new to Angular.js and D3.js so if you see a newb mistake, its probably not a typo, its me having done something wrong.p  pAnyways  Im using Eclipse with m2e and tomcat plugins and running straight from the IDE. Im trying to load a dayhour heatmap with example code I found here a hrefhttpbl.ocks.orgtjdecke5558084 relnofollowblocks.orgap  pI made one small change, where instead of the d3.tsv call, Im using d3.json and implementing a REST call to retrieve the json. The interesting part here is that whenever I restart the server and load the page, I see the heatmap as it is supposed to appear. However, if I refresh the page, it disappears. If I load the page in a new tab, it also will not appear.p  pstrongStrangely enough it does appear when I close and reopen the browser, but then disappears again later with refreshes and new tabs.strongp  pEvery time I refresh the page I can see the REST call being correctly called in the eclipse console. I can also see the JSON data appearing correctly in the javascript console on my browser. These things all happen correctly regardless of whether or not the heatmap appears.p  pBelow is some of my code that I think will be relevant, feel free to ask for more snippets if necessary.p  pREST Controller methodp  precodeRequestMappingvalueheatmap, methodRequestMethod.GET, producesapplicationjson public ResponseBody String getHeatMapValues      return heatMapValues  codepre  pindex.htmlp  precodeAssume all standard javascript imports here are correct the thing does work correctly at least once, and Id have bigger errors anyways ltbodygt      ltdiv classpanel paneldefault ngappHello ngcontrollermyCtrlgt           ltdiv classpanelheadinggt                lth2 classpaneltitlegtVISUALIZATIONSlth2gt           ltdivgt           ltdiv classpanelbodygt               ltdiv classcollg1gtltdivgt               ltdiv roletabpanel classcollg10 styleborder 2px solid blackgt                   ltul classnav navtabs roletablistgt                        ltli rolepresentation ngrepeattab in tabs ngclickselectTabindex ngclassactiveselectedTab  indexgt                             lta datatargettab ariacontrolshome roletab datatoggletabgttab.idltagt                        ltligt                   ltulgt                   ltdiv classtabcontentgt                        ltdiv roletabpanel classtabpane active idtab ngincludetabs[selectedTab].templategt                        ltdivgt                    ltdivgt               ltdivgt              ltdiv classcollg1gtltdivgt           ltdivgt       ltdivgt ltbodygt codepre  pscript.js yes, Ill break up the javascript code appropriately later, now i just want everything to workp  precodevar app  angular.moduleHello, [ui.bootstrap] app.controllermyCtrl, function Helloscope, http       scope.tabs  [idMain,template partialsmain.html,id Clustering,template partialsclustering.html]      scope.selectedTab0      scope.selectTab  functionindex           scope.selectedTab  index       var margin   top 50, right 0, bottom 100, left 30 ,       width  960  margin.left  margin.right,       height  430  margin.top  margin.bottom,       gridSize  Math.floorwidth  24,       legendElementWidth  gridSize2,       buckets  9,       colors  [ffffd9,edf8b1,c7e9b4,7fcdbb,41b6c4,1d91c0,225ea8,253494,081d58],  alternatively colorbrewer.YlGnBu[9]       days  [Mo, Tu, We, Th, Fr, Sa, Su],       times  [1a, 2a, 3a, 4a, 5a, 6a, 7a, 8a, 9a, 10a, 11a, 12a, 1p, 2p, 3p, 4p, 5p, 6p, 7p, 8p, 9p, 10p, 11p, 12p]     d3.jsonheatmap,     functionerror, data        var colorScale  d3.scale.quantile           .domain[0, buckets  1, d3.maxdata, function d  return d.value ]           .rangecolors        var svg  d3.selectchart.appendsvg           .attrwidth, width  margin.left  margin.right           .attrheight, height  margin.top  margin.bottom           .appendg           .attrtransform, translate  margin.left  ,  margin.top          var dayLabels  svg.selectAll.dayLabel           .datadays           .enter.appendtext             .textfunction d  return d              .attrx, 0             .attry, function d, i  return i  gridSize              .styletextanchor, end             .attrtransform, translate6,  gridSize  1.5               .attrclass, function d, i  return i gt 0 ampamp i lt 4  dayLabel mono axis axisworkweek  dayLabel mono axis         var timeLabels  svg.selectAll.timeLabel           .datatimes           .enter.appendtext             .textfunctiond  return d              .attrx, functiond, i  return i  gridSize              .attry, 0             .styletextanchor, middle             .attrtransform, translate  gridSize  2  , 6             .attrclass, functiond, i  return i gt 7 ampamp i lt 16  timeLabel mono axis axisworktime  timeLabel mono axis         var heatMap  svg.selectAll.hour           .datadata           .enter.appendrect           .attrx, functiond  return d.hour  1  gridSize            .attry, functiond  return d.day  1  gridSize            .attrrx, 4           .attrry, 4           .attrclass, hour bordered           .attrwidth, gridSize           .attrheight, gridSize           .stylefill, colors[0]        heatMap.transition.duration1000           .stylefill, functiond  return colorScaled.value         heatMap.appendtitle.textfunctiond  return d.value         var legend  svg.selectAll.legend           .data[0].concatcolorScale.quantiles, functiond  return d            .enter.appendg           .attrclass, legend        legend.appendrect         .attrx, functiond, i  return legendElementWidth  i          .attry, height         .attrwidth, legendElementWidth         .attrheight, gridSize  2         .stylefill, functiond, i  return colors[i]         legend.appendtext         .attrclass, mono         .textfunctiond  return    Math.roundd          .attrx, functiond, i  return legendElementWidth  i          .attry, height  gridSize     codepre  ppartialsmain.htmlp  precodeltdiv idchartgtltdivgt codepre  ppartialsclustering.htmlp  precodeltbgthi thereltbgt codepre

Negative 905 pIve been developing a site and taking advantage from the rather good a hrefhttpleafo.netstickykit relnofollowjQuery Sticky Kita plugin. It operates by switching the codepositioncode property to codefixedcode and back when appropriate. Runs very smoothly in desktop and acceptably so in mobile.p  pOr at least it used to. iOS 9 comes with a new behavior if the codepositioncode of an element changes from codestaticcodecoderelativecodecodeabsolutecode to codefixedcode while the scroll animation is ongoing the element becomes invisible until after the scroll has come to a stop. Oddly enough the opposite change from codefixedcode to whatever else is performed without issues.p  pA working example can be found on a hrefhttpleafo.netstickykit relnofollowthe plugins homepagea. The black navigation bar Examples Reference is supposed to be sticky. Originally its codestaticcodely positioned in midpage. As you scroll down it becomes codefixedcode and in iOS 9 disappears until scroll stops. Behavior in desktop browsers and iOS 8 is correct.p  pI was kind of hoping for the typical CSS workarounds forcing a 3D transform, disabling backface visibility and the like, obscure proprietary properties, ... But nothing seems to work.p  pAny thoughts Or are we to forget about stickable elements altogether now that it was workingp  pCheers,p  pPablo.p
