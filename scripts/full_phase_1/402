Negative 402 pI am in the middle of a discussion with a colleague about the best way to implement the data layer in a new application.p  pOne viewpoint is that the data layer should be aware of business objects our own classes that represent an entity, and be able to work with that object natively.  p  pThe opposing viewpoint is that the data layer should be objectagnostic, and purely handle simple data types strings, bools, dates, etc.p  pI can see that both approaches may be valid, but my own viewpoint is that I prefer the former.  That way, if the data storage medium changes, the business layer doesnt necessarily have to change to accommodate the new data layer.  It would therefore be a trivial thing to change from a SQL data store to a serialized xml filesystem store.p  pMy colleagues point of view is that the data layer shouldnt have to know about object definitions, and that as long as the data is passed about appropriately, that is enough.  p  pNow, I know that this is one of those questions that has the potential to start a religious war, but Id appreciate any feedback from the community on how you approach such things.  p  pTIAp

Negative 402 pI have several DNN modules that I wish to update silently, using the portals builtin module upgrade facilities called from a separate application, in this case a Windows service. I was able to make it all work with version 4.3 of the portal by modifying the DNN source in key areas to allow DotNetNuke.dll to function outside of a web application. Im now trying to do the same thing with the 4.9.0 source code and Im having problems.p  pEverything works fine until DNN tries to read from the database. I have my Windows service project, the DNN library project, and several other related projects loaded in one VS solution the additional projects are the same ones that are in the main solution file provided with the DNN source. I call PaInstaller.Install in my service to update each module. Execution gets to reflection.vb and then it tries to create a DotNetNuke.Data.SqlDataProvider object based on the type name. It raises an exception when calling System.Web.Compilation.BuildManager.GetType. The exception saysp  pCould not load type DotNetNuke.Data.SqlDataProvider from assembly System.Web, Version2.0.0.0, Cultureneutral, PublicKeyTokenb03f5f7f11d50a3ap  pI read this to mean it simply couldnt locate the DotNetNuke.SqlDataProvider.dll assembly. Whats strange is that assembly is in the Bin folder for the DNN library project, and I also have it in the folder where my Windows service is running. The actual SqlDataProvider project is also loaded in the solution. I cant for the life of me understand why the runtime environment cant locate the assembly.p  pHas anyone tried something like this before, or know what could cause an assembly not to be found while stepping through the DNN source Am I better off using something other than BuildManager.GetType to get an instance of the SQL provider typep

Negative 402 pI have an application with modules. Every Module is completely selfcontained. There are no shared events or anything else between them.

But if I change some data in the popup, close it, unload my module, load the module again, and open the popup again, Mate throws the following errorp  blockquote   ul   liERROR Unable to set property model on CDBInputMask because is not type CDBPresentationModel.

First time through all works fine, Second time through it crashes, all because the class is already injected.p  pI tried to use a debugger with tracing to see how I could clear the popup or clear the module.

Negative 402 pIm looking for a better than On algorithm to determine if a date in the future will have daylight savings time applied and how much.  Given a year, month, day, hour, minute and time zone and a copy of the Olsen Time Zone database how does one efficiently determine if that date will be in DST  Im looking for the algorithm, not a library function to call.p  pThank you.p  pFURTHER EXPLANATION  The date library Im using is very slow when you create an object with a date in the future and a time zone.  It turns out its doing a linear calculation to calculate if the date is in daylight savings time.  Not only that, its doing this at object creation time.  Obviously it could wait until asked, but it should also be more efficient.p  pSure, DST rules change and a date library cant predict the future, but the alternative is to put an arbitrary upper limit on localized dates.p

A single line of LINQ is enough for about half of the RoleProviders methods.p  pHowever, the Membership provider is a differend beast. Many of you may realize that it violates the SR Single Responsibility principle, because it has to do EVERYTHING related to user management. While this leaves a lot of room for customizations, it has its downsides as well. There is no information on the Internet about what their EXACT expected behaviour is, such as when should they throw exceptions or simply return null, and stuff like that.p  pI use a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary6tc47t75.aspx relnofollowthis sample implementationa for reference, but it also contains several contradictions.p  ul liFor example, it uses its own ValidateUser method for checking for credentials in the ChangePassword method.

So, does the framework expect that I set it in my own provider as well, or is it simply a mistake in the sampleli liThe other is the ChangePassword method throws an exception every time when validating the new password, but CreateUser doesnt ever throw an exception, it simply returns false.li lipAnd last, but not least it counts the invalid password attempts of the user and locks them if it passes a threshold. While this is good, but it requires manual action to unlock the users. Is it a problem if my provider automatically unlocks the user after a certain amount of timepli lipEDIT I almost forgot the CreateUser method in the sample inserts the ID from the method parameter. I actually think this is bad practice, because I use inters with auto incement as IDs, so inserting them from some method parameter is not an option. Should I just ignore the parameter, or require that its value is null and throw an exception if it isntpli ul  pAll in all, does ASP.NET have any assumptions about the behaviour of a MembershipProviderbr Is there any documentation which describes when should I throw an exception or just return nullp  pI also tried to find a set of generic unit tests which would provide some guidance about the expected behaviour, but no luck, I found plenty of articles about Unit testing is good, and How to unit test a MembershipProvider, but not one where there would be any actual tests.p  pThanks in advance for everyonep

Negative 402 pHi I would like to start by saying Id greatly appreciate anyones help on this. I have built a small caculator to calculate the amount a consumer can save annually on energy by installing a ground heat pump or solar panels. p  pAs far as I can tell the mathematical formulas are correct and my client verified this yesterday when I showed him the code. Two problems. The first is that the calculator is outputting ridiculously large numbers for the first result. The second problem is that the solar result is only working when there are no zeros in the fields. p  pAre there some quirks as to how one would write mathematical formulas in JS or jQueryp  pAny help greatly appreciated.

Negative 402 pOk... I know about the difference between the baseactive SDKs and the deployment target.  I have my base SDK set at 4.0 and the deployment target set at 2.0.  I am not using any APIs post 2.x, conditional or otherwise.  Since I cant debug on a 2.x device, after building it, I use the iPhone Configuration Utility to install the app on the device, which it does just fine.  Problem is, it doesnt run  I just get a blank screen.  The main window never comes upp  pNow before you ask...p  ol lipI had this same problem with the iPhone SDK 3.x.  I upgraded to the 4.x hoping it would be solved.  It wasnt.pli lipYes the provisioning profile is installed. Couldnt install the app if it wasnt.pli lipThis same compiled app works fine on 3.x devices.  Same with 4.x devices.  Just not 2.x devices.pli lipAgain, no I am not using any post2.x SDKs.  To prove this I created a brandnew, windowbased app from the New Project dialog and the only changes I made was the background color of the window to prove the XIB loaded and I set the deployment target to 2.0 Its still compiled against the 4.x SDK though.  Again, it runs fine on 3.x or 4.x devices, but just a black, blank screen on 2.x devices.pli ol  pIve tried this on three separate 2.x devices included one freshly restored.  Ive used three separate dev machines MacBook Pro with the 3.x SDK, MacBook Pro with the 4.x SDK and a Mac Pro with the 3.x SDK.  Same result every time.p  pI am stumped.p  pThe fact that even an unmodified project doesnt run really has me confused.  Could it be the XIB file  Did they change the format from 2.x to something newer in the 3.x SDK  If so, how do I set it back to 2.x. Again, this is just a complete guess.  But Im really stumpedp  pMarkp

Negative 402 pI have a producer object, that steps through some data and emits various signals depending on what data item is next in the queue.p  pEach of those signals are processed by at most one consumer object at a time it takes care to disconnect its slots before attaching the producers signals to the other consumer.p  pIf the processing on the consumer side fails for whatever reason, the processing of the queue must stop, as there is no point in going ahead with it.p  pWhat would be the optimal way of letting the producer know, that no further processing is needed because of an exceptional condition Since the consumers have a pointer to the producer, I would imagine, that there could be multiple ways, its just that I am not sure if they are raceconditionsafe I dont know if I can depend on the order in which signals are emitted  processed.p  pTwo ways I can think ofp  ul liset a flag on the producer, that can be checked on the next iteration so that it will know that it is time to stopli liregister a signal on the consumer and a corresponding slot on the producer, that will be emitted when processing should be haltedli ul  pI am wondering if these solutions are viable at all in the following scenariosp  ul liproducer and consumers belong to the same threadli liproducer and consumers belong to different threadsli ul  pIn short, I have to make absolutely sure, that no additional processing will happen if the consumer reports an error.p  pAs you can probably guess, I am not very familiar with Qts idioms for such things yet.p

Negative 402 pI am using Weblogic 10g clustered environment to deploy my application.  In my application, I have used a class codeCache.javacode to load some properties from database lazily.  This is how it works.  codeCache.javacode is a singleton class with instance variables as cache objects.  For example, one of the instance variables is codeListltStringgt STORESINCITYcode.  This cache is null when the clusters start.  The actual values are in database.  The implementation of the class is given belowp  precodepublic class Cache      private ListltStringgt STORESINCITY      private static final Cache cachenew Cache      public static Cache getCache              return cache           private Cache               private constructor to have singleton class           public ListltStringgt getStoresInCity              ifnullSTORESINCITY  STORESINCITY.size0              STORESINCITYgetStoresFromDatabase                  return STORESINCITY       codepre  pMy question here is that there are multiple calls to database for getting the cache STORESINCITY.  I believe this is because of the clustered environment, as for each server, there is a different JVM instance and a copy of cache.  So depending on which server is hit for a request at runtime, the database call is made.  I want to have a single cache across servers.  Is this possiblep  pI hope the I have elaborated on my question enough.  If any further explanation is needed, please let me know.p  pThanks, Siddharthp

Negative 402 pThis is a rather random problem.  Im using CSS3Pie to handle CSS3 compatibility in IE, but Ive run into a snag.  With PIE in a lot of cases you need to use positionrelative for it to work properly in IE.  p  pThis becomes an issue when I use it on containing wrappers, as it then moves in the zero reference inside of the layout.  The software we use for mapping on our sites uses an absolute position of the top left corner of the browser as its point of reference for calculating positioning.  Ideally our software would be more flexible and not reliant on an absolute position like that, but thats probably not going to change anytime soon.p  pSo getting to my question, is it possible to somehow take an element out of the flow of the layout and refer back to the original 0,0 top left position while being contained within a relatively positioned object  I thought maybe zindex might work, but it doesnt make the element refer back to absolute 0,0.p  pThe most simple workaround is to not apply PIE to my wrappers, but then that also removes rounded corners and dropshadows from my layout wrapper.  That isnt the end of the world, but ideally Id like to come up with a solution.p

Negative 402 pIs it possible to remote debug script code with Visual Studio 2010p  pI have a JavaScript issue which occurs only on IE6IE7.  Im developing on Windows 7 64bit so can only install IE6 and 7 as Virtual Machines.p  pIve setup remote debugging between my development machine and the Virtual Machine and can successfully attach to the IEXPLORE process but I cannot debug it as Script code.p  pIn VS2010 from Debug  Attach to Process, when I try to Attach to the IEXPLORE process on the remote machine VS2010 listed it as x86 type Script is not displayed. And when I press Select to select the Code Type the choices do NOT include the script option only, Managed, Native, Silverlight, TSQL, Workflow.p  pThus, although the debugger is attached to the remote process, it is not debugging the script so my breakpoints do not hit.p  pI have enabled debugging in Internet Explorer on the Virtual Machine.p  pThis page a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarybb385613.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarybb385613.aspxa suggests that remote debugging of Script code is possible.

Negative 402 pIm writing a DLL in C for use with VB6. As such, I cannot have a constructor called in my DLL according to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4829962usecdllwithvb648300984830098this discussiona. However, I need to maintain an instance of a class internally  so I intend to keep the object as a global variable and call the constructor from a global function, and after that, use another global function to call a method on the object.p  pI had the idea that maybe one function would be enough It would check if an instance is present in a global variable, and if not, create it, and then call the method on the object or, if it is present, immediately call the method. p  pNow, how can I find out whether an instance is already created I cant assign a global variable any value in the declaration, right And they also dont have a guaranteed default value in C, as far as I understand.p  pTherefore my question Is this possible anyway and howp  pOr can I use the codeBOOL APIENTRY DllMain HMODULE hModule,                        DWORD  ulreasonforcall,                        LPVOID lpReserved                      code function to initialize variables If so, can someone fill me in on what the codeulreasonforcallcode cases exactly are and which of these is automatically called when VB6 loads the DLL as in my linked examplep

Negative 402 pMy scenario is the following Workflow XAML is stored in database, then i create WorkflowServiceHost from it and the client can call it. No problem until here I have XAML1 at endpoint1.p  pLater the user changes the xaml.

So ended up with endpoint1endpoint2 for XAML1XAML2 and client can decide which to call some way.p  pFinally my question is, is there a way to detect somehow that the first WorkflowServiceHost has no pending instance inside I mean all workflows completed inside and you can safely dispose that service host.p  pAt worst case i may use custom tracking participant to log if instance is running, but maybe there is other way....p  precode activity comes from xaml var jobHost  new WorkflowServiceHostactivity, new Urinet.pipelocalhostWorkflowHost jobHost.AddServiceEndpointIWorkflowHost, new System.ServiceModel.NetNamedPipeBinding, Job1  extensions  behaviors jobHost.Description.Behaviors.AddinstanceStore jobHost.Open codepre

Negative 402 pI am working on a Java app which is of course supposed to run on the major operating systems from a usb stick. For the Mac users I bundled the jars App and updater into Apple .app programs. Now what is the best way to let the jars launch each other and use the relative folder path on the stick. I am asking because I noticed that on a Mac it is like the .app folder is the file launched and not the jar inside and thus the parent dir is the working directory where all my files will be stored. On Windows and Linux it is just some MyApp.app folder and the files will be inside.  Is case and path switching by code really the only way to solve this Thank youp

Negative 402 pIve looked at example of logging in Scala, and it usually looks like thisp  precodeimport org.slf4j.LoggerFactory  trait Loggable    private lazy val logger  LoggerFactory.getLoggergetClass   protected def debugmsg gt AnyRef, t gt Throwable  null Unit      ...  codepre  pThis seems independent of the concrete logging framework. While this does the job, it also introduces an extraneous lazy val emin every instanceem that wants to do logging, which might well be every instance of the whole application. This seems much too heavy to me, in particular if you have many small instances of some specific type.p  pIs there a way of putting the logger in the object of the concrete class instead, just by using inheritance If I have to explicitly declare the logger in the object of the class, and explicitly refer to it from the classtrait, then I have written almost as much code as if I had done no reuse at all.p  pExpressed in a nonlogging specific context, the problem would bep  pHow do I declare in a trait that the implementing class must have a singleton object of type X, and that this singleton object must be accessible through method def x X p  pI cant simply define an abstract method, because there could only be a single implementation in the class. I want that logging in a superclass gets me the superclass singleton, and logging in the subclass gets me the subclass singleton. Or put more simply, I want logging in Scala to work like traditional logging in Java, using static loggers specific to the class doing the logging. My current knowledge of Scala tells me that this is simply not possible without doing it exactly the same way you do in Java, without much if any benefits from using the better Scala.p

Negative 402 pI did a search here already, and havent found a clear answer to my question, so I thought the time was right to post. p  pI have an iOS application that was developed using Xcode 3.2 and SDK 4.2.

I have installed the latest version of Xcode and iOS SDK. My question is this  if I rebuild my app using this new XcodeSDK combination, and set the target iOS level to something older than 5, for backwards compatibility, this still means that my application is built for, and is thus compatible with, iOS5, correct I will of course test it with iOS 5, but I want to be able to claim its supported on iOS5, while still maintaining backwards compatibility.p  pDo I understand correctly how this worksp  pThanksp  pMarkp

Negative 402 pI am making a game. It consists of a JPanel that contains several other JPanels. 1 bottom panel, with buttons, 1 top panel, with buttons, one panel in between those two panels that is the regular Game screen, and then several SlidingPanes and dynamic JPanels that slide in or pop up from clicking buttons on the top or bottom panel or from clicking somewhere on the game screen. p  pRight now, I am drawing a truck that follows a path on the game screen. The truck draws fine, but whenever I click a button to open the sliding pane, it gets drawn over by the Game Screen panel, making it flicker as it opens and then not show until I mouse over it. The Game Screens paintComponent method is the cause of this, it is bringing the Game Screen to the front whenever its repaint method is called, when I want it to stay behind the Sliding Panes or panels that pop up on top of it.p  pIs there a way to make the game screen stay at the layer it is without paintComponent bringing it to the topp  pPlease let me know if you have any questions.p  pThank youp

Negative 402 pI am creating some plugins that use ajax to fetch the information for the page. Now there are different plugins that do different functions. p  pAll the plugins need to be used as standalone, but I also want to add the functionality that they can work nice together.p  pAll the different plugins have there own JavaScript file, and functions. This is no problem in terms of HTTP requests, because most people have plugins that merge all the files into one when the website is deplyed.p  p p  pNow for my question. As I say the different plugins get different parts of the website. For example, post counts, user tweets, user  statistics, post comments.p  pNow can I specify the priority on which this information is called from the website.

Negative 402 pIm having a problem where when I get an onResume, I re create the EGL and GLES state from scratch, but it wont draw anything any longer. The important code is identical between the initial create and the resume code. Im currently stumped as to what could cause this. Things work perfectly with the initial creation and display of my EGL surface. Only when the app is resumed press home button, then go back into the app does it fail to display anything. Ive verified that everything else is behaving as it should, input is received, and android callbacks happen as normal no blocking or locking up in either the dalvik or rendering threads. The EGL and GLES state are completely destroyed and recreated between onPause and onResume.p

Negative 402 pIm creating a gallery section for my app which will be used to show an X amount of images. These images are being loaded from an external server. The user is shown a codeGridViewcode containing thumbnails of the images, and upon clicking on these thumbnails the codeGallerycodeview is opened which shows the image in fullscreen mode. An codeArrayListcode is used to hold the codeStringcode objects containing the links to these images. In the codegetViewcode method of my codeAdaptercode this codeArrayListcode is used to see which image needs to be shown.p  pSo far this works fine, but Ive run into a problem when a user picks a different image then the first image in the codeGridViewcode. When the user clicks the 7th image for example, the codeGallerycode shows the 7th image. But when the user flings to the right to see the previous images 6th image and before, nothing happens. When he flings to the left to see the upcoming images the user is presented with the 2nd items of the list, then the 3rd, then the 4th etc.p  pObviously, the codeGallerycode thinks that whatever image I provide it with first, is actually the first item on the list, and starts showing everything after that as it should have if the image was actually the first. But, the codeGallerycode should show the image as the actual position it was on the codeGridViewcode. How can I achieve something like that Ive tried messing around with the codepositioncode I get when clicking my codeGridViewcode, but this just results in the behavior I have described above.p  pHeres the code I used for thisp  pstrongPhotoFullView the gallery and adapter for the gallerystrongp  precodepackage com.mobowski.appfrag.json.pictures  import java.io.BufferedInputStream import java.io.InputStream import java.net.URL import java.net.URLConnection import java.util.ArrayList  import com.mobowski.appfrag.R  import android.app.Activity import android.content.Context import android.graphics.Bitmap import android.graphics.BitmapFactory import android.os.Bundle import android.view.Display import android.view.View import android.view.ViewGroup import android.widget.BaseAdapter import android.widget.Gallery import android.widget.ImageView  public class PhotoFullView extends Activity       Called when the activity is first created.

Negative 402 pIve recently been writing java code to send notifications to the Apple Push Notification server.

But the javadoc states that setSoTimeout will only throw an exception when reading from the InputStream.

Negative 402 pI am new to Ruby on Rails and set myself a little project to get to grips with it. The project is simple just a basic jobs board where a person can post a job. I Also want to have users to have a skills section. I have the user created along with sessions and also got the jobs created so the user can post a job and only edit their own ect. I now want the user to add skills associated to themselves. I am confused on how I can achieve this in terms of when viewing a users profile in the user view, it will also display their skills. I assume I need t create a new scaffold for the skill and create a relationship user hasmany skills ect. Is this along the right lines Also how can i get the skills to be shown on the users profile. p  pAny help would be really appreciated.p

Still when users set 10 tasks running simultaneously, the threadpool will start all of them and there have been times that we run out of memory and exceptions occur.  We can handle the errors just fine.p  pWhat I am wondering is if there is a way to take the memory that will be consumed into account when processing the queue, i.e. keeping tasks queued until sufficient memory exists  Can I inform the threadpool about how much memory we will be asking for which we can roughly estimate p

It should not be exactly as in snake where it abruptly turns left or right but it should more be a smooth curve.

Negative 402 pIm trying to port Apples GLPaint example to use GLKit. Using a UIView, its possible to return the CAEAGLLayer of the view and set the drawableProperties to include kEAGLDrawablePropertyRetainedBacking. This has the effect of retaining the drawable contents after presenting the render buffer, as expected. Removing this property results in flickering after the draw call with part of the drawable content seemingly being drawn to different buffers.p  pThe problem is this is exactly the issue I am now having in my GLKView, but there doesnt seem to be a way to set the drawable properties. Returning a CAEAGLLayer and setting the properties has no effect and I dont see any relevant properties of GLKView to set retained backing.p  pHas anybody else come across this or have a solutionp

I also want to be able to list all Items on the front page, and render them differently Quotes need to show their content.p  pCan anyone help with thisp

Negative 402 pThis time I wont be saying Im new to razor mainly because Im coming here for quite some time now, cant escape this feeling however. Let me show you why I still feel this way.

I need to know is there a centralized place something like msdn by microsoft for asp.net mvc3 RAZOR oriented only, specifically related to front end controls, like SelectList and things like that.

Negative 402 pRecently I am developing a context menu in WPF with the following requirement,p  pstrongIf all the menu items in the context menu have Visibility Hidden, set the context menu visibility to Hidden.strongp  pI have a solution myself for this in a DataTemplate, which is to set ContextMenu Hidden as default, and use a Trigger for each menu item to check their visibility, if any of them is visible, trigger the ContextMenu visibility into visible.p  pSo the code is likep  precodeltDataTemplategt     ltContextMenu VisibilityHidden xNamecontextMenugt         ltMenuItem xNamemenuItem1 VisibilityBinding somebinding gt         ltMenuItem xNamemenuItem2 VisibliityBinding somebinding gt     ltContextMenugt     ltDataTemplate.Triggergt         ltTrigger SourceNamemenuItem1 PropertVisibility ValueVisiblegt             ltSetter TargetNamecontextMenu PropertyVisibility ValueVisible gt         ltTriggergt         ltTrigger SourceNamemenuItem2 PropertVisibility ValueVisiblegt             ltSetter TargetNamecontextMenu PropertyVisibility ValueVisible gt         ltTriggergt     ltDataTemplate.Triggergt ltDataTemplategt codepre  pmy problem is that this really depends on the control which owns this context menu in this case it is the DataTemplate. We actually want to make this context menu behavior independent and put it in a resource so that other controls can share with it. p  pI am trying to do it in a Style trigger of the context menu itself, but in a Style trigger I cant use the target name and source name. p  pCan anyone help me think of a better solution Thanks.p  pS.p  pUPDATEp  pLooking at the examples in the link from Nikolay, I implemented a converter as belowp  precodeltContextMenu xNamecontextMenu VisibilityBinding PATHItems, ConverterStaticResource Convertergt     ltMenuItem xNamemenuItem1 VisibilityBinding somebinding gt     ltMenuItem xNamemenuItem2 VisibliityBinding somebinding gt ltContextMenugt codepre  pIn the converter, it checks the visibility of each menu item and set the proper visibility value of the context menu.p  pBut the problem I found is that WPF evaluates the bindings from top to bottom, so ContextMenu is evaluated first and then the MenuItem, in this case my converter doesnt work because at the time of binding, the Items is still None. p  pAny tips guysp

Negative 402 pIm investigating using Varnish with ESIs to cache page content for a high traffic forumlike website.p  pContext  I want to cache content for visitors only connected users will have a really different display and need absolute fresh content. Still, for visitors, some parts of a page need to be dynamic    not cachable, for example for a visitordependant module think a suggestion widget that is fed with a realtime analysis of the pages viewed, thanks to a beacon  cachable with a small TTL of 15mn, for example for a latest posts widget or for very changing ads campaigns.p  pCurrently we are using ApachePHPsymfonymemcache to cache pages and have inhouse ESIlike mecanism  a page from cache is parsed and some specific tags are interpreted including calls to web services andor databases. This is not performant enough since server time is then around 700ms.p  pIn remplacement of this solution, we can have VarnishESIs. The total nb of ESIs included in a page can reach 15. The real number of ESIs to fetch will be less than that but not so much given the ESIs TTLs. The critical problem is that Varnish fetches the ESIs sequencially instead of parallel and this is not acceptable. This feature is somewhere late in Varnishs roadmap.p  pSo,p  ul lipWhat is your experience with Varnish and ESIs  How many ESIs, response time gain that you have pli lipDo you know workarounds or other serious and configurable VCL was nice reverseproxies with parallel ESI fetching pli lipIf not, what kind of good caching strategy do you use for equivalent usecases pli ul  pThanks, P.p

Negative 402 pI found a opensource code that was a much simpler version of NAudio for my C application. Which for me is better because all I am looking to do is play a brief sound out of the speakers to test that they are plugged in and working, and I also want to listen to the microphone. The project it self looked ok, but i felt that it could be refactored a bit into smaller chucks. Another thing i found is that the WaveOutBuffer.cs and WaveInBuffer.cs files were remarkably similar. So i started to make a abstract class WaveBuffer. This would have all the similar functions and variables in it that would be passed. One that i am having troubles with is as follows. Another file WaveNative.cs has  delegate in it. I am very new to delegates and Events so i know it has the potential to be very important. but i dont like the way that it is setup to be used. So ill post what Is in each file and how it is used, then show what i have been trying to get to work. Maybe between all of our minds we can consolidate and refactor this to make it more efficient p  pso First.p  pstrongWaveNative.csstrongp  precodecallbacks public delegate void WaveDelegateIntPtr hdrvr, int uMsg, int dwUser, ref WaveHdr wavhdr, int dwParam2 codepre  pstrongWaveInBuffer.cs  WaveOutBuffer.csstrongp  precode    internal static void WaveInProcIntPtr hdrvr, int uMsg, int dwUser, ref WaveNative.WaveHdr wavhdr, int dwParam2              if uMsg  WaveNative.MMWIMDATA                      try                              GCHandle h  GCHandlewavhdr.dwUser                 WaveInBuffer buf  WaveInBufferh.Target                 buf.OnCompleted                          catch                                         WaveOutBuffer.cs version     internal static void WaveOutProcIntPtr hdrvr, int uMsg, int dwUser, ref WaveNative.WaveHdr wavhdr, int dwParam2              if uMsg  WaveNative.MMWOMDONE                      try                              GCHandle h  GCHandlewavhdr.dwUser                 WaveOutBuffer buf  WaveOutBufferh.Target                 buf.OnCompleted                          catch                                         codepre  pstrongWaveInRecorder.cs  WaveOutRecorderstrongp  precodeprivate WaveNative.WaveDelegate mBufferProc  new WaveNative.WaveDelegateWaveInBuffer.WaveInProc private WaveNative.WaveDelegate mBufferProc  new WaveNative.WaveDelegateWaveOutBuffer.WaveOutProc codepre  pIn the end they are used for a PInvoke call as followsp  precode    [DllImportmmdll]     public static extern int waveOutOpenout IntPtr hWaveOut, int uDeviceID, WaveFormat lpFormat, WaveDelegate dwCallback, int dwInstance, int dwFlags     [DllImportmmdll]     public static extern int waveInOpenout IntPtr phwi, int uDeviceID, WaveFormat lpFormat, WaveDelegate dwCallback, int dwInstance, int dwFlags codepre  pIve consolidated most the other things in the abstract version of WaveBuffer such as the HeaderData, the size of the header, the IntPtr data, a GCHandle HeaderHandle, and HeaderDataHandle.

Negative 402 pIm working on a little hobby Python project that involves creating dictionaries for various languages using large bodies of text written in that language. For most languages this is relatively straightforward because I can use the space delimiter between words to tokenize a paragraph into words for the dictionary, but for example, Chinese does not use a space character between words. How can I tokenize a paragraph of Chinese text into wordsp  pMy searching has found that this is a somewhat complex problem, so Im wondering if there are off the shelf solutions to solve this in Python or elsewhere via an api or any other language. This must be a common problem because any search engine made for asian languages would need to overcome this issue in order to provide relevant results.p  pI tried to search around using Google, but Im not even sure what this type of tokenizing is called, so my results arent finding anything.

Negative 402 pI refer to the code in the Connection class of the boostasio HTTP Server 3 example a hrefhttpwww.boost.orgdoclibs1490dochtmlboostasioexamplehttpserver3connection.cpp relnofollowhttpwww.boost.orgdoclibs1490dochtmlboostasioexamplehttpserver3connection.cppap  pIt can be seen that each of the async operations are invoked on a boostasioioservicestrand.  This ensures that the completion handlers will not be invoked concurrently.  However, the example server can be run with multiple threads calling ioservicerun which means any of these threads could be used to invoke the handlers.  All of the handlers in this example invoke methods on the boostasioiptcpsocket object.  To me, this is sharing the socket object between threads although not invoking methods on it concurrently.p  pI can see no synchronization around the socket calls so my question is what mechanism is in place for ensuring that each thread has the same view of the state of the socket object  The documentation clearly states that it is unsafe to share an instance of boostasioiptcpsocket.p

Negative 402 pId want to allow all users of a mobile app to post to a same Facebook account, account whose credentials I dont want them to know... Id simply want to make it transparent to users, I mean, Id like to show users an app dialog where they could write a message and post it to a certain Facebook account, and let users know they are posting to a certain account, but I dont want them to know the credentials of such account and have to login on it.p  pSo, firstly, I need to avoid the Facebooks login dialog being displayed to my users. As far as I know, it is possible to skip the login dialog step if you already have an access token.

Negative 402 pThe title is probably not be explicit enough, so let me try to explain. Im working on a new project, built on .NET, it consists of WPF clients that use WCF web services to access an Oracle database. The problem is not this basic architecture, but rather how its supposed to work with whats already in place.p  pCurrently, applications are written using PowerBuilder and connect to the database directly. Additionally, they use Oracles codeSELECT .. FOR UPDATEcode statements extensively to manage concurrency by locking records. Since the new applications must exists sidebyside with the old ones, they are supposed to lock records in a similar manner too, but the new architecture that relies on web services does not make this easy.p  pFor the moment, what we are thinking of doing is build a data server that would be called by the web services and would be responsible for accessing the database. The purpose of this server is to maintain the open connectionstransaction needed to maintain record locks throughout several web service calls. This is needed because the select and the subsequent update parts of the operations that require codeSELECT .. FOR UPDATEcode are most likely going to happen in at least two separate web service calls get record and post update.p  pIve searched the Internet for documentation regarding this kind of situation, but I cant seem to find much on the subject. Can thisi.e. keep record locks open throughout several web services callsbe done Properly Is my approach appropriate Are there any published best practices on the matterp  pstrongUpdatestrong The original title of the question was emHow to maintain record locking with a service oriented architectureem I changed it following Johns suggestion, hoping it may inspire some answers.p

Negative 402 pI just began playing with LibGDX, and am already facing a problem with the camera.p  pI saw some tutos on Internet which told, if I understood well, that in a 2D game using LibGDX you have to recalculate the position of all of your entities I mean everyinthg on the screen taking in parameter the velocity etc...p  pFor me it means that the camera doesnt move, but the world that it shows. I would like to do opposite, moving the camera but not the world, as it makes more sense to me, and looks to be easier as I just have to move the camera, not all entities. So I dont want the world to move and my camera to show changes, but my camera to move and show changes. So even if some entities doesnt move their coordinates x amp y doesnt change, it will look like as the camera moves.p  pSo I have a codeCameracode class that inherit from codeOrthographicalCameracode, and an codeEntitycode class. I have also 2 interfaces codePositionListenercode amp codePositionListenablecode  Pattern Observer.p  pSo what I tried to do isbr   My camera listens to only one of my Entity e.g. the playerbr   When my entity moves, it updates the camera with its coordinate x, y and my camera changes its position to x and y to follow my entity.p  pHere is the code in Camera.java p  precodepublic class Camera extends OrthographicCamera implements PositionListener       public Camerafloat width, float height          superwidth, height           Override     public void entityMovedfloat newX, float newY          translatenewX  position.x, newY  position.y         update         Gdx.app.logentityMoved, newX  newX    newY  newY         Gdx.app.logentityMoved, position.x  position.x    position.y  position.y  codepre  pp  pWhen I read logs, I see that codeposition.xcode and codeposition.ycode changed as I expected to do to follow my entity, but visually the camera doesnt move  Everything looks the same as if my camera doesnt translate p  pMy camera is not moving at all, only my entity br  What am I missing  I read something about viewPort but really didnt get the thing as I am a beginner with LibGDX.p
Negative 402 pI have a simple Windows Forms Application which is written C 4.0. The application shows some of the records from database. The application features a query option which is initiated by user. p  pThe records in the database we can call as jobs Consider the two columns JobID and Statusp  pThese being updated by two of the background services which in fact work like a producer consumer services. The status of the job will be updated by these services running behind.p  pNow for the user, who has an option to query the records from the database, say for e.g. to query data based on status Submitted, processing, completed. This can result in thousands of records and the GUI might face some performance glitches on displaying these much of data.p  pHence, its important to display chunks of the query results as pages. The GUI isnt refreshed until user manually refresh or make the new query. p  pSay for e.g. Since the jobs are being constantly updated from the services, the job status can be different at any point of time. The basic requirement that the pages should have the data at the time those were fetched from the DB.p  pI am using LINQ to SQL for fetching data from the DB. Its quite easy to use but there isnt something midlevel caching required to meet this demand. Using the process memory to cache the results can shoot up page memory to the extreme if the number of records are very high. Unfortunately LINQ isnt providing any midtier caching facilities with the DataContext objects.p  pWhat are the preferable way to implement a paging mechanism with C 4.0  SQL Server  Windows environmentp  pSome of the alternatives I feel like to have a duplicated tableDB which can temporarily store the results as cache. Or using Enterprising Application Librarys Application Cache Block. I believe that this is a typical problem faced by most of the developers. Which is the most efficient way to solve this problem. NOTE my application and DB running on same boxp

Negative 402 pSo lets say I have a WPF form with several text boxes, if you tab to the text box and it already has something in it, I want to select all the text in that box so typing will erase that text.  If you mouse click on the box, it probably means you want to change a letter somewhere, so do not highlight all in this case.  Seems easy enough, but a good solution as so far eluded me.  Heres what I have so far that is very emcloseem to working, but not quite perfect.p  precodeltStyle xKeyTextBoxStyle TargetTypeTextBoxgt     ltEventSetter EventGotKeyboardFocus HandlerEventSetterOnHandler gt ltStylegt codepre  pp  precodeprivate void EventSetterOnHandlerobject sender, RoutedEventArgs e      TextBox txt  sender as TextBox     if txt  null txt.SelectAll  codepre  pSo when the box gets keyboard focus it selects all, so tabbing to the text box selects all the text perfectly.  However if the mouse clicks this method gets called as well, which also highlights the text, but the click then puts the cursor where the mouse clicked after.  So functionally its perfect, but it still bothers me that it flickers selecting everything when the mouse clicks.  Any better way to do this, or put some kind of check in my event to know that I gained keyboard focus from a mouse click and not a tabp

Negative 402 pIm quite new to Java and programming, but Im trying to learn by doing.

Negative 402 pI set up Hudson on a Windows XP machine and got some builds and tests running on it.  Next, I want to install the programs built on the master on other machines and do further tests there.  On a second XP machine, I installed Hudson as a Windows service. I created a node for a slave on the master, as outlined in e.g. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3294386hudsonstepbystepguidetosetupmasterandslavemachinesHudson  Step by step guide to set up master and slave machinesa. I can reach that node from the slave by http master8080computerslavenode1.  According to the descriptions, I click Launch agent from browser on slave. Firefox shows an open with dialog, and I select JavaTM Web Start Launcher Standard. Java is started, a small window with the title Hudson slave agent shows up having the message Handshaking on the main area, and then an error message pops up p  precodejava.land.Exception The server rejected the connection Unauthorized access at hudson.remoting.Engine.onConnectionRejectedEngine.java272 at hudson.remoting.Engine.runEngine.java233 codepre  pIn some documentation, I read something about a certificate of the master to be trusted on the client. But no further information on how to do that, hence I could not check that.

Negative 402 pIm troubleshooting a project that was created by a programmer who no longer works in my organization, and in the code behind for this particular page, there are session variables being used and I cant tell what the value of these variables are or where they are defined.p  pI have read through more than the following pages regarding Session State couldnt post as many as I wanted due to limitations from Stack Overflow a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms178581vvs.100 relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms178581vvs.100a a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary6ad7zeebvvs.100 relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary6ad7zeebvvs.100ap  pMaybe I just cant seem to wrap my brain around the fact that Session variables dont have to be defined. But my main question is  how does ASP.NET know what the value of the session variables are if they are not defined in the code explicity For example, how does ASP.NET know the value of Session variable named varCalDept How does ASP.NET know that a Session variable named varTextBox is equal to the value of a text box on the web form if that variable isnt explicity assigned to the textbox As far as Im concerned, without an explicit definition, that variable could be equal to a label text, a combobox, or anything, right The whole thing just seems arbitrary to me.p  pThe purpose of the code Im looking at is to get calendar events from a database and then send them to the calendar control on a web page, highlighting the background of the days on the calendar that have events on them.p  pA part of the code I can refer to specifically that is confusing me is the section that creates the dataset and data adapter, then fills the data adapter with a certain query if a session variable is equal to a certain valuep  precodeDim ds As New DataSet Dim da As OracleDataAdapter If Not SessionvarCalDept Is Nothing Then  If SessionvarCalDept  CountyWide Then   da  New OracleDataAdapterltquery heregt  Else   da  New OracleDataAdapterltquery heregt codepre  petc.p  pI cannot find a definition of varCalDept anywhere else in the project, so I am just confused.

If you dont think you can answer my question, but you can point me in the right direction, I would greatly appreciate it. Any articles, resources, etc. regarding this matter would be helpful.p

This is a auto generating form, so the same code produces the same fields.  I say this because, they have several other dropdown felds on the form and the value displays correctly, without the strike thru and with the  tag in tact.p

Negative 402 pIm out of ideas so Im posing the question to StackOverflow.  I recently started a scala project.  I setup Eclipse 3.7.2 on Windows 7 and downloaded the latest stable release of the a hrefhttpscalaide.org relnofollowScala IDEa 2.0.2.  The problem Im experiencing is that when the package explorer pane is pinned open in my workspace and I switch context away from Eclipse and then back to Eclipse, it takes a very long time for Eclipse to redraw itself.  It can take anywhere from 2 to 10 seconds to fully redraw.  I know its related to the package explorer because I dont experience the issue at all when its not open.  Im not sure its specifically related to Scala IDE, but all Ive been using Eclipse for recently is with Scala projects and so far Ive experienced this problem with all of them.p  pSo far Ive tried optimizing my JVM settings as described in the a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions142357whatarethebestjvmsettingsforeclipsefollowing posta.  Ive also tried reverting to a Java 6 JVM.p  pIm open for new suggestions or advice on how to troubleshoot this problem further.p  pEDITp  pIve since discovered there are many views similar to package explorer in the way that they let you navigate a project via its directory or package structure.  Theres the package explorer, project explorer, and navigation view.  Now that Im using the navigation view I no longer experience any performance problems mentioned in my original post.  However, the question still stands why does using package explorer have such a detrimental effect on Eclipse performance.p  pEDIT 2 Scratch that, even while using other project navigation type views I still have the problem.p

But if i run the above code, although the buffer is correctly filled, the performance is so slow or maybe not  You decide  that i can read those 4194304 bytes in strongalmost 5 secondsstrong, thats strongless than 1MB per secondstrong. Im using Eclipse directly connected to my Optimus Dual smartphone the same time is required for the read even if i put the reading operation in a loop maybe overhead initialization wouldnt take place if multiple reads are performed...Not the case.p  pThis file sizetime relation doesnt change if i reduce or make the file larger 8 megs will be read in almost 9 seconds, 2 megs in 2 seconds, and so on.

Please tell me your opinion is 1MB per second the actual performance on a modern smartphone, or is there something wrong with my code  Thank youp

These pages contain dynamic JQueryUI information and this will be lost if a new page is opened.p  pI need to be able to give focus to existing pages or open them if they are not already visible.p  pThe code below works well if the calling page opened the page needing focusp  precodefunction launchApplicationlurl, lwindowName    if  typeof launchApplication.winRefs  undefined          launchApplication.winRefs        if  typeof launchApplication.winRefs[lwindowName]  undefined  launchApplication.winRefs[lwindowName].closed         launchApplication.winRefs[lwindowName]  window.openlurl, lwindowName    else      launchApplication.winRefs[lwindowName].focus     codepre  pMy problem is referencing pages that were not spawned by the calling page.p  pI have done quite a bit of research and it seems that due to security considerations, open browser windows not spawned by the calling page are not accessible.p  pIs there any way I can implement this functionality  I know the URLs and window names for all pages and browsers are limited to Chrome and Firefox.p  pAny advice greatly appreciated.p
Negative 402 pIn my application, there is this line of code causing troublep  precodepublic class DisplayListingltR extends ListingltR, Lgt, L extends ListingltR, Lgt.Loadergt extends SherlockListFragment  ...  codepre  pWorking with Eclipse everything behaves fine. But after switching to IntelliJ IDEA errors are popping upp  blockquote   pNo enclosing instance of type com.app.Listing is in scope.p blockquote  pThis error message refers to the part codeListingltR, Lgt.Loadercode Loader is a nonstatic class.p  pWhen I go to IntelliJs preferences and change the compiler from Javac to Eclipse Im back to business the application will successfully compile and run again.p  pBut the red mark indicating an error will stay and I would like to get rid of that. So Im wondering if Im actually doing something wrong and my generic arguments should be fixed or if it is okay to rely on the Eclipse compiler and ignore the errorp

Negative 402 pI am working on a clientserver TicTacToe game that consists of one server, and a client that consists of two threads. The entire program includes a TicTacToeServer class, TicTacToeService class, and TicTacToeClientPanel which is the GUI and the client put together. p  pThe main problem I am facing is within the client class itself. I launch two windows of the GUIclient for the two different players, and am able to place one marker X on the first player. After this, the threads seem to halt, and I am unable to continue playing the game.p  pIf I attempt to put client 1s player 1 thread to sleep, it sleeps for its given allotment, but client 2s player 2 thread never begins.p  pIs there any way that I can alternate between these two threads and go through my program, dependent on which players turn it isp  precode    import java.awt.

Negative 402 pIm working on a university project where Im writing software for an Atmel SAM7S256 microcontroller from the ground up.

These addresses are used by the startup assembly code and initialization C code in order to initialize the correct locations in the MCUs RAM.p  pWhat I have a problem understanding, is how these symbol definitions result in the correct values being assigned. This does happen, the script is correct, I just dont understand how.p  pThe way I understand it, when you use the location counter within a section, it only contains a relative offset from the virtual memory address VMA of the section itself.p  pSo for example, in the line coderamstart  .code, I would expect ramstart to be assigned a value of 0x0  as it is assigned the value of the location counter at the very beginning of the .ramvect section. However, for the initialization code to work correctly which it does, ramstart must be getting assigned as 0x00200000 the address for the beginning of RAM.p  pI would have thought this would only work as intended if the line was instead coderamstart  ABSOLUTE.code or coderamstart  ADDR.ramvectcode.p  pThe same goes for codefastcodestartcode and codestackstartcode. They cant all be getting defined as address 0x0, otherwise the program wouldnt work. But the documentation a hrefhttpsourceware.orgbinutilsdocs2.21ldLocationCounter.htmlLocationCounterlinked herea seems to suggest that thats what should be happening. Heres the quote from the documentationp  blockquote   pNote . actually refers to the byte offset from the start of the current containing object. Normally this is the SECTIONS statement, whose start address is 0, hence . can be used as an absolute address. If . is used inside a section description however, it refers to the byte offset from the start of that section, not an absolute address.p blockquote  pSo the location counter values during those symbol assignments should be offsets from the corresponding section VMAs. So those start symbols should emallem be getting set to 0x0. Which would break the program.p  pSo obviously Im missing something. I suppose it could simply be that assigning the location counter value to a symbol within a section results in ABSOLUTE being used by default. But I havent been able to find a clear explanation anywhere that confirms this.p  pThanks in advance if anybody can clear this up.p

Negative 402 pI am confused about how should I handle http sessions in a standalone java app. Here are the details p  pThe java client connects to 3 tomcat 7 servlets. When the client boots up, it starts 2 scheduled threads downloader and uploader polling 2 of the servlets every 3mins. They both retrieve and store the jsessionid cookie in private fields in their respective classes.  This results in 2 sessions in tomcat reused for the lifetime of the webapp. So far so good.p  pThere is a 3rd service connected to the 3rd servlet using multiple instances of a threaded  WebDispather class which retrieves and stores the session similarly to the above mentioned threads but this time  in a private static field. The dispatcher is heavily used,  there might be as many as 150 instances running concurrently depending on the load. Dispatcher threads hit the servlet ever second or so. p  pMaking the dispatcher sessionid  field non static creates a session per instance  not good.p  pWhat are the implications of having all dispatcher threads bound to the same tomcat http sessionp  pThank you p  hr  pEDIT although dispather threads a bound to same session the session itself doesnt hold any information.

Negative 402 pIve worked with the code.Existcode method quite a bit, but I recently moved to a new project now using a WPF application with QTP 11 whereas previously I had QTP 10.p  pNow Id like to check that a message does not exist by using codeobject.Exist2code. Weirdly, I only get a result after 23 seconds, instead of the 2 seconds I was expecting.p  pHow does the timeout work In previous projects, using codeobject.Exist2code would wait 2 seconds before determining that the object didnt exist. The QTP help file also says it should only wait for 2 seconds the specified timeout parameter. Now, it seems as though its waiting for the Timeout Parameter 2 seconds AND Object Synchronization Timeout 20 seconds.p  pAlso, Smart Identification is disabled, so it shouldnt be waiting for that. Highlighting the object using the Object Repository instantly says the object doesnt exist.p  pHas the timeout behavior changed between QTP v10 and v11 Why does it take so long to say an object doesnt existp
Negative 402 pI have spent a large portion of the morning trying to populate and pass an array of populated structs to C from Java using JNA.  I have significant portions of JNA based code running and I feel like this should be simple, but I can not figure out or find an example that does not use deprecated functions.  My suspicion is that this is trivial and Im going to feel dumb when someone shows me, but I would really appreciate some help.p  pA little background on what I have tried I somehow doubt it matters, but after learning how to write the interface files by hand and getting them to work, I switched over to JNAerator.  JNAerator translatesp  precodeMyStruct mine codepre  pto p  precodeMyStruct mine codepre  pin Java.  This confuses me a bit because in Java this could only be used to point to a single object.  At one point I looked at using p  precodeMyStruct mine codepre  pwhich translates to p  precodePointerByReference mine codepre  pBut this seems like overkill because I dont need to modify the structs, or ever access them again for that matter.  I have tried everything I can think of from this point on but I have never managed to successfully send more than the first struct.p

Negative 402 pI have my site configured so that it will automatically render different versions of a video in the background. Its actually working really well. If the video is successful in the three different transcodes it will send a success email. However, if it generates an error, it will send a failure email.

What do I mean by that  I took a screenshot of the point before and after the media query triggers on both Chrome and Firefox.

So I technically can not call codeInvokeOnMainThreadcode on any object.p  pIs there any other way to obtain screen resolution without codeUIScreen.MainScreencode If not, I will have to move initialization to some code invoked from UI.

Negative 402 pIm having this thought on my mind for quite some time and i still can not find any answer. My DbContext is handled by an UnitOfWork class. So i have one place where savechanges occur and i am catching all of those nasty exceptions and handling them in one place. p  pBut, as it is widely known, the DbContext can sometimes throw other types of exceptions in another places besides in the SaveChanges method. For example when materializing the entities. But this can happen in many places and it is sometimes overhead to write try catch blocks on every FirstOrDefault or ToList call and catching and re throwing exceptions. Sometimes this exceptions can be of SQL type meaning a connection cannot be open, EntityCommandExecutionException or others.p  pSo i was wondering is there any event that DbContext object fires when an exception occurs, so i can subscribe to that event and handle some logic in these scenarios. p

Negative 402 pFor a platformindependent model layer, I have hierarchical data strings, actually that look like thisp  ul liItem A ul liSubItem Ali liSubItem Bli liSubItem C ul liSubSubItem Ali liSubSubItem Bli ulli liSubItem Dli ulli liItem Bli liItem Cli ul  pNow, within each level Item, SubItem, SubSubItem, etc. the items need to be sorted alphabetically.p  pSeems a simple solution would be to create a simple class with a sorted stdVector or stdMultiMap to track its Children, and a pointer to its Parent.  and one root item.  I would need to generally iterate through each items children in a forward direction.p  pAfter constructionsorting, I do not need to add or delete items.  Generally small numbers of items hundreds.p  pThis is for model organization of the backing data of an outlinestyle control.p  pRolling a simple class would be easy, but this is such a common pattern  isnt there already a readymade STL container with this behaviorp

Negative 402 pI am trying to create a simple catcher game. I have the basic structurelogic figured out but I am facing some problems. For some reason the lives are not updating as I want them to. The only time they actually do work is when a good crane exits the screen at the top, then they decrease by one. But other than that catch a bad crane or catch a plus crane is not decreasing or increasing it by one. Similarly, the score seems to work for the good crane, adding the amount of score I specify, but not for the bad or the plus cranes. p  pWhat am I missing Helpp  precode    package       import

Negative 402 pIm looking for a simple, efficient way to implement a simple fetchAndSet with the GCC atomic builtins. The closest thing I see a hrefhttpgcc.gnu.orgonlinedocsgcc4.6.4gccAtomicBuiltins.html relnofollowherea is the codesynclocktestandsetcode builtin, but that doesnt issue a full memory barrier like the others do, and all of the other functions either do operations add, sub, xor, etc. or are conditional the compare and swap functions. These wont work because Im trying to manipulate a variable holding arbitrary pointer data.p  pThe best I could come up with was something like thisp  precodetype fetchAndSettype loc, type newvar    while 1      type oldvar  syncfetchandaddloc, 0     if syncboolcompareandswaploc, oldvar, newvar return oldvar     codepre  p... in other words, Im atomically fetching the value at the memory location, then breaking out of the loop as soon as I successfully replace that old value with the new value.  Im not really satisfied with this solution since its not a single atomic operation, and theres a pretty heavy risk of starvation if two or more threads are vying for the same memory location.  So, my question is there a better way to do thisp

Negative 402 pSo Im working on a game and there is a form input where the user enters the number of characters. Once this happens more inputs appear for each characters name.

I put a prompt at the end of the function just to check and that does not even get called.

Negative 402 pI am trying to install a Python module in command prompt.  The directions state to run .configure to install the module and then run a codemakecode command.  However, whenever I do that, I receive the error p  pcode. is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.codep  pI am still relatively new to using Command Prompt and Python, so this could be a very novice issue.  From what Ive read from other questions, it seems that command prompt should automatically recognize the code.code command, so my only guess is something in mycodePATHcode variable could be tricking it.  Any thoughts or suggestions will be greatly appreciated.

Negative 402 pIs there a way to automate the task of keeping the settings.xml used by Maven in sync with domain password changes  The list of repos in settings.xml is growing as more development migrates to maven, and so the task of updating is also growing.p  pWeve recently started using maven with some internal corporate svn repositories that use each developers domain user ID and password to control their repository access.  Our domain passwords expire and must be changed frequently.  Which means frequently updating .m2settings.xml with a new passwordhash.p  pI would prefer a bash or csh solution that makes use of simple commands that already exist on my systems.p  pI saw references to a hrefhttpwww.sonatype.orgnexus relnofollowSonatype Nexusa here on SO  looks like it might help, and I will suggest it to our CM staff.  But Im not optimistic that it will be adopted soon, if ever.  And I have no time to maintain a private copy of yetanother tool.p  pIdeasp  pThanks, Kenp

Negative 402 pI dont remember exactly when this functionality stopped working, but I always had Sublime Text do auto indenting properly. For example, if I type codeltdivgtcode and then press kbdEnterkbd, the caret would automatically make a tab on the next line. Similarly, when I closed tags, they would automatically unindent by one tab such as when pressing kbdaltkbdkbd.kbd in order to close a tag.p  pThis functionality seems to have disappeared, at least in ST3, and I cant find any way to get it back. Anyone have any ideasp  pEdit it might be useful to add that PHP autoindenting works just fine, such as making indentation between brackets.p

Negative 402 pI have been using Subversion for years now and am just starting the move to git. My typical setup was to develop on a Windows machine with a local working copy. My IDE would automatically ftp changes to my dev web server. And if I ever wanted to get a clean slate on my dev server Id run an codesvn exportcode. I liked this style because it gave me two places where my files resided. I had a bit of redundancy and could wipe out one or the other without fear of it being completely gone. I know committing my changes would do the same thing for me, but that was my little safety net.br Now with git it seems that there is no direct equivalent of codesvn exportcode. I can codegit archivecode, but then that goes to a tar and i have an additional step of untaring it. The only other solution Ive come up with has been to put a local git repo right on my webservers root folder. Could someone tell me if this is standard practice with git or if there is some alternative that Ive missedp

Negative 402 pI made a modification in a php file and uploaded it via Filezilla. It always worked fine for me, even if sometimes it would not upload immediately. This time, however, its not working anymore in any way. I upload the file with the same name and it looks like it overwrites the old one, but the size of the file doesnt change. When I open the site on the browser Ive been testing in Chrome and Firefox and already cleaned their caches many times since then, and still nothing happens and look at the source code, it shows the new code with the modification, but even so the site is still the same old one. When I open the file directly from Filezilla it also shows the modified file, but the file size doesnt change. It started yesterday, before the upgrading to version 3.7.3. Its updated now, but the files are still not being updated. I also tried renaming the file, deleting it from the ftp and uploading again, uploading it to another folder and then moving it to the root, but nothing happens. Any idea of what can be causing thisp

Negative 402 pIm a beginner in Android programming, and Im working on a small bubble shooter game. However, I face a weird problem which I cannot figure out. I have a piece of code which handles the launcher of the app, if I program the whole code in class, the app runs smooth. However, if I cut the code into different classes there a noticeable lag in the movement of the launcher.p  pMy main question is what can cause this lag, and what is the best approach to avoid this

Negative 402 pThis is a theoretical question but any specific technical knowledge that could help will also be appreciated. I am an IT Assistant with not much knowledge in programming apart from EasyPattern and supersimple batch files but have been given an opportunity to start getting into it by having been given a task to create a step in our document management system which is vaguely defined by the title of this question.p  pstrongCONTEXTstrong So, we have incoming faxes with short digit codes on them, these code correlate to identifying information in our database relevantly email addresses. In a watched folder environment we have software that upon autoacknowledging these faximage files being dropped into a designated incoming location from a fax server it initiates Microsoft Digital Imaging MODI, runs in the background to find these codes using OCR, Optical Character Recognition and places them into CSV files one .csv file per code per fax page. Our database admin assures me that he can have the email addresses that correlate to the codes automatically placed into their correlating csv file. p  pstrongGOALstrong It is from this point that I am being asked to find a way to have a universal unchanging email message We have received your fax automatically sent to those email addresses. Upon a way being known, I am then to actually accomplish it.p  pstrongQUESTIONstrong How to do this As I said, a valid theoretical answer will suffice, for that will tell me how it can be done, which would in turn tell me what to learn, which would in turn tell me where to look. p  pstrongWHERE IM AT NOWstrong I understand VBA to be a programming model within an eventdriven paradigm and that VBA programming projects are possible and supported in both Microsoft Outlook and Access. Does herein lie my answer Can VBA used to accomplish this maybe auto import the email addresses from the csv file into the To field of a outgoing email Im hoping itll be easier since the message can always stay the same something along the lines of We received your message. Im reading two text books that introduce the reader to VBA in Access with one, and VBA in Outlook with the other. p  pI hope this message makes sense, this whole question might be naive, incoherent, or maybe even outright ignorant. But any patient and understanding response would be GREATLY appreciated.p

Negative 402 pIve created a project using EF code first but am stuck with the application unable to initialize unless I enable automatic migrations which I dont want.

There is one row in the migration history table for my one migration InitialState. It all looks fine, but when I run up the application, still get the same initial error.

Negative 402 pWe have some applications that use ProC for database interactions.  Ive gotten used to the features offered by Visual Assist, but I cant seem to get any of those features to work when editing ProC files, since Visual Assist doesnt seem to be parsing the files.  Even if I can get autocompletion to work, and only that, it would make life significantly easier when editing these files.  How can I do thisp  pI havent found anything in the settings dialog for Visual Assist. If it matters, Im using an old version 10.7.1929.0 since we havent renewed our licenses.  If this is solved in newer versions, that would give us good reason to upgrade.p

Negative 402 pI am trying to build a movie web application using Django. I decided to go with Cassandra as the back end. After studying cassandra for quite some time I found that the Thrift APIs are legacy now and the community is encouraging to use CQL 3.0 However in Django I am not aware of any support for cql. As far as I know there are a hrefhttpsgithub.comvaterlausdjangocassandrabackend relnofollowhttpsgithub.comvaterlausdjangocassandrabackenda a hrefhttpsgithub.compycassapycassa relnofollowhttpsgithub.compycassapycassaap  pBut both follow the Thrift API. Also I couldnt find many examples of Cassandra and Django integration like MongoDB. I have decided upon using Cassandra after quite some research and seeing the power of CQL 3.0 I dont want to abandon my database choice. Instead I am willing to look for other web frameworks in Python like Pylons, Flask etc. So any suggestion on that And as I have used Django in the past I want to continue to use it, however the principle advantage of Django which is the Django ORM for relational databases isnt applicable here. Is there any way to integrate MySQL and Cassandra with Django to make it work Also is there any tutorial of setting up Cassandra with Django besides the Twissandra examplep  pBesides observing the settings.py of Twissandra it saysp  precodeDATABASEENGINE  sqlite3          DATABASENAME  dev.db  codepre  pLink  a hrefhttpsgithub.comtwissandratwissandrablobmastersettings.py relnofollowhttpsgithub.comtwissandratwissandrablobmastersettings.pyap  pHow come it specifies sqlite3 if it is working on Cassandra Am I missing some kind of integration here         p

Negative 402 pWe have an Application MQ Queue marked as triggered and a MQTTFIRST set on it.p  pWhen a message arrives into that queue for the first time the Queue Manager creates a trigger message and writes it into an initiation queue we defined for that purpose. The trigger message fires up the execution of a monitoring process that will start a triggermonitor application which will go and read messages from the application queue one by one.p  pWe use Spring JmsTemplate  to read messages one by one from the application queue. That jmsTemplate instance opens a connection to the application queue, reads  a message from there and then closes the connection.p  pThe problem we have is that when the connection is closed if there are multiple messages in the Application queue a new trigger message will be sent to the initiation queue which will cause another triggermonitor application running on a different host to pop up. This is not what we want as for us it is essential to have only one message consumer active at the same time as message sequence is very important.p  pThe reason we have multiple triggermonitor applications or consumers is for a HA reason.p  pSo my question is Is there a way to prevent MQ manager to send multiple MQTTFIRST trigger messages to the initiation queue and make it only send it once when a message arrives in an empty queue and that is it. If we really wanted a message trigger being sent again we can use the Trigger Interval for this but for what we are trying to achieve there should be no more than one trigger message in the initiation queue no matter what.p  pThank in advance Julian p

Negative 402 pIm using a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms77512328vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowURLDownloadToFilea to download update files for my game. The function is synchronous, so I have it running in a separate thread, and I use a IBindStatusCallback specifically the onProgress function to handle the progress bar, and cancelling. It seems to be working great.p  pRight now Im working on timeout mechanisms so that the download will cancel if it hangs. So, during testing I thought Id interrupt the download by disconnecting my internet. When I do this, the download completely freezes, seemingly forever. URLDownloadToFile never returns. Worse, the IBindStatusCallbackonProgress function doesnt ever get called again. This means I have no way of telling the process to cancel.p  pIf the connection is restored, sometimes the download recovers, but other times it doesnt and just sits there forever.p  pThis makes me think that I shouldnt even be using this technique in the first place, but its just so simple and functional other than this issue. Is there a way around this problemp  pIm developing on Windows 7, and I have read while Googling that this issue may appear for some versions of Windows but not for others...p  pEDIT Possibly worth mentioning is that this function is included in the URL Moniker set of Internet Explorer Platform APIs in Urlmon.lib. Its possible that there is some separate function in the API or command that I could use to cancel the download or fix the problem another way.p

Negative 402 pI have an app that communicates through USB with an external device. It works in the background and periodically checks if the device is connected to USB and starts reading data from it. When the device is connected, the app in addition shows a window to the user. The app is installed per user and launches when the user logs in. The app is written in C using QT and works on Windows and Mac OS X.p  pThe problem is that if 2 users have the app installed and are logged in in the same time by the switch user feature for example, there are 2 instances of the app running and both of them will start communicating with the device, which causes data corruption.p  pId like to implement a check that prevents the app from starting the communication if the owner of the process isnt currently active. Then only the instance started by the active user will be communicating with the device this assumes only one user can be active, but its fine for personal computers. Ideally, Id be very happy to see a QT based solution that works on both Windows and OS X, but platform specific solution will also be fine.p  pI was wondering if a solution that activates the apps window and the checks if the window is active after that will work.p  pBest regards, Michalp

a few different methods to speed it up, including using fewer materials, but it did not help running speed much if at all can easily get by with a few different colors if it helps performance and dont need large level of detail as far as colors go. Also, I tried merging the meshes of the cubes and it speed it up fantastically, but then there was only one material for all the cubes which wont work for this.

Negative 402 pWe make a device that can appear as a USB serial port on a variety of POSIXcompliant systems. Im supporting an API that allows callers to retrieve a list of all the currently available i.e. not in use, have correct privileges, etc. instances of our device available to them. The caller can also get a list where the inuse devices are also indicated.p  pThe simple way to do this of course is just attempt to openclose each candidate serial port and take note of which ones are openable. I would prefer not to do this as it is possible that multiple applications using this API which would be a library  dylib in their app could create race conditions where they both try to query the same serial port simultaneously which would cause one app to erroneously think the device was in use.p  pSo what I need is a way of knowing the port is openable without actually opening it. I have seen others use lockfile schemes where there is a special file created to indicate the port is in use  the assumption being that if the file is not present the port is available. My problem is that there may be other users of the port other than my library that do not abide by such as scheme, so I cannot rely on it.p  pIs there perhaps some lowlevel POSIX functionality that lets me query a files status in this regard without actually attempting to open itp

I had no issues before yet each time I attempt to run the app, it crashes, giving me the following errorp  precodenull was false Reached the max number of texture atlases, can not allocate more. codepre  pI found this issue page on Google Code for the SDK a hrefhttpscode.google.compgmapsapiissuesissuesdetailid5756httpscode.google.compgmapsapiissuesissuesdetailid5756a  here, I am made to believe that the issue with my crash is down to the number of custom marker images I am using. Each aircraft model has a different image, and these are loaded as they are rendered and a UIImage assigned to a GMSMarker.p  pNow, the problem I have is with a large amount of results, I get this crash. At the same time, I also want to have individual images for each marker. p  pMy question is, is there a way that instead of assigning each marker a UIImage of a specific aircraft, can I refer once to each image to optimise performancep  pI appreciate your help, please let me know if I havent made myself clearp

Negative 402 pI have problems in tracing the ODBC database connections in 32bit mode. The trace file CODBCTraceSQL.log always come up empty.p  pI have shortcut to the ODBC console at CWindowsSysWOW64odbcad32.exe. I even set this shortcut to run as Administrator. p  pWhen I open this 32bit ODBC as you can see in the image file, I turn on the tracing for all users, and I set the logfile path to CODBCTraceSQL.LOG. I even confirm this in the Registry of WOW6432Node under HKEYLocalMachine. I can see that when I turn onoff the tracing, the value of registry flag Trace will be 10. So I verify that I am at the right place.p  pHowever, just a caution note here  A I have to manually add the registry key TraceFile because for some reason it does not exist. B In the Trace DLL, I tried putting in the 32bit DLL located in CWindowsSysWOW64odbctrac.dll. But, after every click on Apply or OK button, next time this value would magically change back to CWindowsSystem32odbctrac.dll in the System32 folder which I believe is 64bit native. Same observations is happening in registry too I manually change the trace DLL to the one in folder SysWOW64, and later this registry value changes it back to the one in folder system32 p  pI have some intermittent database connection problems from this Windows 2008 R2 server to my Oracle database, so I want to trace the problem. The application specific driver is in 32bit, so this is why I am using the 32bit ODBC console.  p  pIn the same picture also shows the folder and file permission, with Users and EVERYONE can write into the folder CODBCTraceSQL.log.

Negative 402 pIs there a way to programmatically determine the parameters sequence and types thereof to a function in Gop  pI would like to translate an HTTP request into a methodfunc call dynamically, to avoid having to write duplicative marshaling code yes I know Ill need to be very careful about what methods I expose and the possible security risks involved. This would only seem to be possible if I can inspect the parameters a function expects, parse the appropriate values from the request and then dynamically call the function looks like the last step would use reflect.Value.Call  at least that part seems straight forward.p  pEDIT The advantage of being able to do this is that you can create a method that is suitable for use directly in Go as well as remotely.  For example, if you have a func like thisp  precodefunc UpdatePersonp Person error  ...  codepre  pThat obviously is usable in Go and I want to be able to expose that externally via HTTP as well.p  pUsing jsonrpc comes close but looks like it would in some cases require some more crufty structures to be used for the io on it.p  pEDIT 2 Basically I have a whole shipload of CRUD to write and I want to just expose parts of the DAO without having to write all this crazyass marshaling code to make another layer that deals with the HTTP stuff.  For some security sensitive things Ill need to write things more carefully, but many of my DAO functions should literally just be callable directly from the browser  and also from Go.  jsonrpc meets the first requirement, but not necessarily the second.p

Negative 402 pIm using EF 6 Code First and trying to figure out the best way to configure my relationships using data annotations, but for some reason EF is adding extra columns to the schema that I dont want.p  pI have two entities codeShipcode and codeVoyagecode. A ship can have many voyages a voyage belongs to one and only one ship. So I started out with this simplified for SO purposesp  precodepublic class Ship      public int Id  get set      public virtual ICollectionltVoyagegt Voyages  get set    public class Voyage      public int Id  get set      public int ShipId  get set      public virtual Ship Ship  get set      public DateTimeOffset Started  get set   codepre  pThis creates two tables in the database, as followsp  precodeCREATE TABLE [dbo].[Ship]      [Id]                INT                IDENTITY 1, 1 NOT NULL,     CONSTRAINT [PKdbo.Ship] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED [Id] ASC   CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Voyage]      [Id]               INT                IDENTITY 1, 1 NOT NULL,     [ShipId]           INT                NOT NULL,     [Started]          DATETIMEOFFSET 7 NOT NULL,     CONSTRAINT [PKdbo.Voyage] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED [Id] ASC,     CONSTRAINT [FKdbo.Voyagedbo.ShipShipId] FOREIGN KEY [ShipId] REFERENCES [dbo].[Ship] [Id] ON DELETE CASCADE  codepre  pSo far, so good. The problem comes when I want to query this data. I need to obtain a list of ships, but for each ship I want the emmost recentem voyage as well. I couldnt see a way of writing a LINQ query that would do this in one hit, even though I would be able to write such a query using SQL.p  pMy options at this point seemed to bep  ul liLoad all ships, and for each ship eagerly load all of its voyages. I didnt want to do this because of the performance implications each ship may ultimately have lots of voyagesli liLoad all ships first, then codeforeachcode over the resulting list and perform a separate query for each ship to load its most recent voyage. Although this works it seems kind of inefficient compared to a single query.li ul  pI then thought I could add a navigation property to the codeShipcode entity that would be used to reference directly the most recent voyage. So I tried thisp  precodepublic class Ship      public int Id  get set      public virtual ICollectionltVoyagegt Voyages  get set      public int MostRecentVoyageId  get set     lt new property added     public virtual Voyage MostRecentVoyage  get set     lt new property added  codepre  pI made codeMostRecentVoyageIdcode nullable because a ship will not have any voyages at all when it is first created.p  pThis gives me the following in the databasep  precodeCREATE TABLE [dbo].[Ship]      [Id]                  INT                IDENTITY 1, 1 NOT NULL,     [MostRecentVoyageId]  INT                NULL,     CONSTRAINT [PKdbo.Ship] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED [Id] ASC,     CONSTRAINT [FKdbo.Shipdbo.VoyageMostRecentVoyageId] FOREIGN KEY [MostRecentVoyageId] REFERENCES [dbo].[Voyage] [Id]  codepre  pwhich is fine for the codeShipcode table, but I get this for the codeVoyagecode tablep  precodeCREATE TABLE [dbo].[Voyage]      [Id]               INT                IDENTITY 1, 1 NOT NULL,     [ShipId]           INT                NOT NULL,     [Started]          DATETIMEOFFSET 7 NOT NULL,     [ShipId]          INT                NULL,     CONSTRAINT [PKdbo.Voyage] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED [Id] ASC,     CONSTRAINT [FKdbo.Voyagedbo.ShipShipId] FOREIGN KEY [ShipId] REFERENCES [dbo].[Ship] [Id] ON DELETE CASCADE,     CONSTRAINT [FKdbo.Voyagedbo.ShipShipId] FOREIGN KEY [ShipId] REFERENCES  [dbo].[Ship] [Id]  codepre  pNote the extra codeShipIdcode column and the additional foreign key relationship. Im pretty certain that this column isnt needed, but I cant find a way of getting rid of it. Ive tried using the code[ForeignKey]code and code[InverseProperty]code attributes but these just give me an exception.p  pIs this the kind of relationship I cant configure using EF data annotations Do I have to use the fluent syntax for this Am I doing it all wrong anyway is there a better way to do the LINQ queries using my original entity typesp  pI have tried looking on SO for people having similar problems and I found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10466660unidirectionalonetoonerelationshipinentityframeworkthisa, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6276299creatingbidirectionaloneonerelationshipinentityframework41codefirstthisa and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions20270588entityframeworkbidirectionalonetoonerelationshiponaforeignkeythisa but none of those seemed to help.p

Not sure if we can reload a PHP script by itself Ive put only the important stuff. p  pthanks in advancep  pmap.php JSp  precodeltdiv idahtgt     ltbutton idahtbuttongtAHTltbuttongt     ltdivgt  ltscript typetextjavascriptgt         document.readyfunction                  aht.clickfunction                     .ajax                     typeGET,                     url  showaht.php, use a token here                     data  ,                     dataType json,                     success  functiondata                         get the MIN value from the array                             var min  data.reducefunctionprev, curr                                  return isNaNcurr[ahtvalue]  prev lt curr[ahtvalue]  prev  curr[ahtvalue]                             , 1000000                              alertmin  min                              get the MAX value from the array                             var max  data.reducefunctionprev, curr                                return isNaNcurr[ahtvalue]  prev gt curr[ahtvalue]  prev  curr[ahtvalue]                             , 1000000                               alertmax  max                             function for calculation of background color depending on ahtvalue                                            function convx                                 return Math.floorx  min  max  min  255                                                           function for background color, if NA then show white background, either show from green to red                             function colorMev                               return v  NA  FFF  rgb  convv  ,  255convv  ,0                                                       going through all DIVs only once with this loop                         forvar i  0 i lt data.length i   loop over results                         var divForResult  desk  data[i][station]  look for div for this object                         ifdivForResult.length   if a div was found                             divForResult.htmldata[i][ahtvalue].cssbackgroundcolor, colorMedata[i][ahtvalue]                         end if                         end for                       end success                 end ajax                  end click             end rdy         ltscriptgt codepre  pshowaht.phpp  precodeinclude dbconnretca2003.php include dbconnretca2001.php headerContenttype applicationjson           matching USER array and MEMO array      for matching username values          result  array     foreach memo as username gt memodata      if inarrayusername, arraykeysuser       Match username against the keys of user the usernames      userdata  user[username]     if AHT is null give NA as value     if isnullmemodata[ahtvalue]          result[]  array username  gt userdata[username],                                              ahtvalue gt NA,                                              station  gt userdata[station]                                                  end inner if      else give the actual value of AHT without the decimals     else          result[]  array username  gt userdata[username],                                              ahtvalue gt substrmemodata[ahtvalue],0,3,                                              station   gt userdata[station]                                              end else     end outer if     end for   echo jsonencoderesult gt codepre

Negative 402 pI have a codeQListWidgetcode which is populated by custom widgets with the use of codesetItemWidgetcode.p  pThese custom list items are completely static, they just have a bunch of labels with various texts and images. My QListWidget is displayed correctly. I allow draganddrop reordering, and after I move an item to a different position, it becomes invisible. It does not vanish, because it takes up space in the display, I can even click on it, its just completely invisible, as if all the labels inside it suddenly became blank. Interestingly, if I set a background color for these widgets, the custom background color is not cleared, only the contents.p  pIf I insert generic codeQListWidgetItemcodes into the codeQListQidgetcode, they remain visible even after movement.p  pWhat causes the custom widgets to become blank, and how can I stop this from happeningp  pExample.p  precodeQListWidgetItem item MyCustomWidget custom  item  new QListWidgetItem itemgtsetTextThis will remain visible listWidgetgtaddItemitem  item  new QListWidgetItem custom  new MyCustomWidget  customgtsetNameQStringThis will vanish  this will add text to one of the labels inside it. listWidgetgtaddItemitem itemgtsetSizeHintQSize50,65 listWidgetgtsetItemWidgetitem, custom codepre  pAfter moving items around with the mouse, the items added via normal QListWidgetItems retain their contents, while those which were added via codesetItemWidgetcode have their contents vanish.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pEven if my custom widget is just a codeQLabelcode, its contents are gone after moving it.p  precodeQLabel label item  new QListWidgetItem label  new QLabel labelgtsetTextThis label will vanish listWidgetgtaddItemitem listWidgetgtsetItemWidgetitem, label codepre  pAs with the custom widget, its size and background color, if set, remain the same, so the item is not deleted. Only the contents of the label are cleared. If I set a background for the label itself via setStyleSheet, its cleared. If I set a background for the item itself, it remains.p  pstrongEdit 2strongp  pIt seems the Widget set in codesetItemWidgetcode will be decoupled after a movement.p  pI created a button, which displays codeqDebug ltlt listWidgetgtitemWidgetlistWidgetgtitem0code when pressed. If I have custom widgets, or for simplicitys sake, codeQLabelcodes as my items, before moving them around it displays codeQLabel0x8b41fd8code, after the movement it displays codeQObject0x0code. It seems the widget attached to the item is deleted. p  pThe a hrefhttpqtproject.orgdocqt4.8qlistwidget.htmlsetItemWidget relnofollowmanuala for codesetItemWidgetcode states that This function should only be used to display static content in the place of a list widget item. I thought it meant we shouldnt put pushable buttons, dynamically changing widgets etc. in them, but now it seems that static content means that the whole QListWidget itself must remain staticp

Negative 402 pI am using the liquibase command line tool version 3.1.0.p  pI am starting to use liquibase to version our postgres database changes.

Negative 402 pI have been struggling with this problem for almost a week now. I need a vb6 application which is running as a service to open a file. I dont need to do anything with the file, I just need it to open. I have tried using ShellExecute and ShellExecuteEx as well as using CreateProcess to attempt to launch the file from the command line. When none of these implementations worked, I tried instead launching another application using CreateProcess with the sole task of opening the file and then closing itself.p  pThese solutions all work when the application is run normally, but Not when it is run as a service. It is extremely important that the application be able to open the file while running as a service, either directly or indirectly, it just needs to be able to trigger it.p  pI understand that Windows has locked down the ability of services to interact with the desktop since Windows Vista, but Im sure there must be a way to trigger a file open command from a service. The app Ive developed is able to run pgdump.exe a backup executable for postgres databases from the command line with CreateProcess to backup database files, while running as a service. That is why I though launching an exe from the service to indirectly open the file might work. However, for some reason the application runs pgdump.exe fine but will not run the executable I created. Im wondering if the exe I created is expecting to have some sort of presence on the desktop and that is why the service doesnt want to start it. I changed the properties of the main form in the secondary exe so that the form would not be visible and wouldnt show up on the taskbar, but something tells me thats not enough.p  pHere is my CreateProcess code I didnt write most of this so please excuse my ignorancep  precodePrivate Declare Function WaitForSingleObject Lib KERNEL32 ByVal     hHandle As Long, ByVal dwMilliseconds As Long As Long  Private Declare Function CloseHandle Lib KERNEL32     ByVal hObject As Long As Long  Private Declare Function GetExitCodeProcess Lib KERNEL32     ByVal hProcess As Long, lpExitCode As Long As Long  create a new win process.

Negative 402 pI have a solution thats been building fine for months. Yesterday I did a full rebuild following a clean that was performed to reduce the solution size for backup, but one of the sub projects failed to link.p  pA bit of backgroundp  pThis subproject is a DLL that always linked statically to MFC, but was recently changed to dynamic linkage because it was assumed the reason for it having been static was no longer an issue it was previously used by an MFC app built under VC 6, and this is a VS 2013 MFC DLL, but the main app has since been migrated to this same VS 2013 solution, so they should both be happy linking dynamically to the same version of MFC, shouldnt they. As it turns out, the DLL links but crashes on the call to DoModal when built dynamically anwswers to this separate question on a postcard, if youd be so kind. So I switched it back to static.p  pBack to the question properp  pOn rebuilding with static linkage I got the following errorsp  precode1gtuafxcwd.libafxctrlcontainer2.obj  error LNK2005 void cdecl AfxRegisterMFCCtrlClassesvoid AfxRegisterMFCCtrlClassesYAXXZ already defined in afxnmcdd.libafxctrlcontainer2.obj 1gtuafxcwd.libafxctrlcontainer2.obj  error LNK2005 protected void thiscall CMFCControlContainerPreUnsubclassControlclass CWnd  PreUnsubclassControlCMFCControlContainerIAEXPAVCWndZ already defined in afxnmcdd.libafxctrlcontainer2.obj 1gtuafxcwd.libafxctrlcontainer2.obj  error LNK2005 public int thiscall CMFCControlContainerSubclassDlgControlsvoid SubclassDlgControlsCMFCControlContainerQAEHXZ already defined in afxnmcdd.libafxctrlcontainer2.obj  codepre  pSearching for this issue on line I understand its fixable by simply commenting outp  precodedefine AFXNOMFCCONTROLSINDIALOGS codepre  pin the cuplprit projects stdafx.h. But whats really bugging me is why this is necessary only now, after linking it statically so many times without issue The project hasnt just been sat there not needing a rebuild by the way, its been changed and rebuilt plenty of times. So has some VS wizard inserted that line at some point when toggling between staticdynamic And why have some define in the first place if you cant link statically when using itp  pSo I have everything working as it was now, Im just curious how this came about ...p  pEditp  pI forgot to mention that the first answer to this question also has me a bit worried, because I now have that define removed but do still have a CDialogEx derived class a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13589518linkerrorsinunmodifiedvisualstudio2012mfctemplatewhenstaticallylinkinLink Errors in Unmodified Visual Studio 2012 MFC Template when Statically Linking MFCap

Negative 402 pHere is the scenario...p  pI am working on an app I had an idea for, Im building it in ember with an express backend. I am using the codeexpresswscode so I can run the codewscode websocket package inside express better.

Negative 402 pIm trying to include a file which generates 2 random numbers that needs to be add or what we call captcha. I have two logins one that requires employee id, birthdate, and the captcha answerWhich I call the easy login. While the other one requires your first name, last name, birthdate, and captchaI call it the standard login. So I have two radio buttons for the user to choose whether an easy login or standard login. So Im encountering this problem when you choose a login then you need to answer the captcha The captcha sends sessions for its answer so whats happening right know is that the captcha in the easy login is always being override by the captcha in the standard login. What I thought that I would do is set a condition where if the radio button is selected easy login then thats the time it will be included.

Negative 402 pI have a WebAPI backend for a mobile, and want to host it in Azure.br I am having a hard time figuring out the real differences between AMS and Websites.p  pAll the articles I read about the subject talks about changes and benefits in general, and I want to understand specifically which new features AMS provides, and the benefits of hosting in AMS.  p  h2Authenticationh2  hr  pIn AMS I see the IDENTITY tab in azure portal. From what I understand, those 3rd party configs allow me to authenticate my users easily with google,FB etc. But this is just making the process more convenient and configurable via UI. In Websites, I can achieve the same functionality pretty easily using code from ASPNet.Identity and OWIN libraris.  p  h2Push Notificationsh2  hr  pAgain looking at AMS in the PUSH tab, I can see two mechanisms. The Notification Hub and 3rd party section.  p  pThe Notification Hub is nothing special to AMS, and I can get the exact same functionality when hosting in Websites.  p  pThe 3rd party section allows me to configure credentials to push services from Apple and Google APNS,GCM... and together with libraries in AMS namespace I can easily write code to communicate with those services. p  pBut When hosting in Websites, in my backend I can use open source libraries. For example, MoonAPNS to talk to APNS.  p  h2Scaleh2  pAs far as I understand, both Websites and AMS allows the same scale functionality One calls it Units and the other Instances. p  hr  pAre there any big differences I missedbr Are any of the claims I made are incorrect  It would be great if anyone could shed some light on the matter, specifically addressing all the 3 issues Auth,Push,Scale.p
Negative 402 pI am currently working with UI Automation. Now I need to figure out how to getclick the particular radio button.

Negative 402 pOur use case is 1 consuming data from ActiveMQ, 2 performing transformations through a general purpose reusable streaming process, and then 3 publishing to Kafka. In our case, step 2 would be a reusable Spark Streaming service that would provide an eventsourceid, enrich each record with metadata, and then publish to Kafka.p  pThe straightforward approach I see is ActiveMQ  Flume  Spark Streaming  Kafka. p  pFlume seems like an unnecessary extra step and network traffic. As far as I can tell, a Spark Streaming custom receiver would provide a more general solution for ingestion into hadoop step 1, and, allows more flexibility for transforming the data as it is an inherent step for Spark Streaming itself, the downside being a loss of coding ease. p  pI would love to gain some insight from my more experienced peers as we are in the beginning stages of transforming a large data architecture please help with any suggestionsinsightsalternatives you can think of.p  pThank you worldp
Negative 402 pIm working on a matlab OOP project where I need to have a getter method with one argument. Since I dont want to make the problem very specific I want to generalize. So heres the contextp  ul liI have a 2D spatial object SpaceObject with the following fields XPos,YPos and MovementModel. li liXPos and YPos describe the position of the spatial object in the XY plane.li liMovementModel is an object which describes the movement of the space object in the XY plane. This field is initialized as empty [] so it can be defined or undefined.li liWhen MovementModel field object is undefined the convention is that XPos and YPos are time invariant. Getting these properties is done implicitly by writing empos  spaceobj.XPosemli liWhen MovementModel field object is defined the convention is that XPos and YPos become time variant. But this time the getter methods need the time valuevalues in conjuction with the MovementModel field object to compute the position in space at any time instant. So I want to have something like this empos  spaceobj.XPosem or empos  spaceobj.XPos1em or empos  spaceobj.XPos[1110]em but Matlab getters cannot have other parameters.li liOne solution would be to make the time variable internal to the space object but I have strong design constraints to have the time variable external to all objects.li liAnother solution would be to have a function instead of a getter named GetXPos but I want to keep consistency with other static objects for which XPos and YPos are time invariant. I want to avoid having mixed signatures like spaceobj.GetXPos1 and otherobj.XPos. But this means I need to write the GetXPos function for all other objects even if it is not required. li ul  pSo the problem here is given by a class property with external dependency. So my questions arep  ul liWhy Matlab doesnt allow other parameters for getter methods Is this requirement conflicting with some OOP paradigms Whyli liHow can I solve this issue in an elegant way Maybe a redesign is required... Anyway my problem may seem trivial but Im looking for a best practicedesign since my project will grow large over time. Any help is much appreciated Thanksli ul

Negative 402 pNonBlocking Concurrent Queue with offer and flushp  pId need an unbounded nonblocking concurrent queue with basically only 2 operationsp  ul lioffer  atomically inserts the specified item at the tail of this queueli liflush  takes all the items present in that moment in the queue and start processing them one by one following the insertion order. More specifically what has to be atomic is only this takeAll operation that will be the very first operation of the flush. All items offered to the queue after the takeAll will be inserted and then processed only by a another subsequent flush.li ul  pThe goal is the consumer has a single CAS operation on the takeAll and can then iterate the elements in the list without going through a CAS operation per read. Further we already own the Node Entry as this is needed to store some other immutable state. The new node can take the HEAD as a constructor argument, creating a single direction linked list.p  pDoes exist in literature a queue with these characteristicsp

Negative 402 pIn Javascript I need to work with the concepts of date, time and date and time  without referring to a particular point in time.

Negative 402 pIm having a weird problem and I cant seem to find anyone else with a similar issue. Im connecting to a device similar to a Zedboard or Raspberry Pi through USB using screen sudo screen devttyUSB0 115200. p  pAt a random point in time after connecting, the screen will become unresponsive. Normally turning off the device will also terminate the screen session, but when the screen becomes unresponsive, turning off the device does nothing. The only way to get rid of the frozen screen is to force close the terminal.p  pWhen attempting to reconnect to the device in a new terminal, the screen stays frozen requiring a force close again. These screens arent visible by screen list, but by searching for the screen processes ps ax  grep ttyUSB0, the screen can be found and multiple are found if reconnecting was attempted. If there were multiple, the others can be easily killed sudo kill 1234 but when killing the first screen process, the type of process goes from Ss to Ds which Ive read means killing wont work and the user just has to wait. It never closes unfortunately.p  pAt this point, when trying to reconnect to the device using the same command, the following error is printed at the top of the screen in rapid succession Cannot open line devttyUSB0 for RW open blocked, aborted. for about 0.5 sec followed by Sorry, could not find a PTY.. Then the screen closes automatically. At this point, Ive tried manually deleting the ttyUSB0 entry in dev and recreating it using mknod, but it doesnt help. All I can do at this point is hard reset the computer.p  pIve tried using minicom and the problem still occurs it will freeze after some amount of usage.  Once it freezes, theres no way to reconnect without resetting the computer. Ive tried different USB ports on the computer as well.p  pIm currently using CentOS 6.5, and Im currently not able to switch my OS so I hope that isnt the problem. Ive tried connecting to the device through a virtual machine VirtualBox Ubuntu14.04.2 and there actually wasnt a crash for a decent amount of usage but I think its probably just due to chance since that shouldnt make a difference.p  pIdeally Id like to figure out how to fix the problem but I would also be okay with just figuring out how to get it fixed without having to turn off and on the computer.p

Negative 402 pI hope the title of my problem is correct. Ill try to give an example. Lets say I have 2 tables table1, table2, they are Identical in structure lets say 3 columns FirstName, LastName, Age.p  pIf I want to get to data in a specific table age of a person in table1, I know I can do something like vlookup or indexmatch. but, and now I get to the tricky part, I want table name to be refrenced in a cell, that when I drag the formula the table name will changep  precodeAge LastName    FirstName 18  Lname1      Fname1 18  Lname2      Fname2 20  Lname3      Fname3   Age LastName    FirstName 22  Lname4       Fname1 22  Lname5      Fname2 21  Lname6      Fname3  so, if I want to get the age of Fname2 from Table1 I would do something like this codepre  pINDEXTable1[Age],MATCHFname2,Table1[FirstName],0p  pBUT, I want the table name to be in another cell so I will be able to drag the formula. put, the table name in cell C3 for example, and do something likep  pINDEXC3[Age],MATCHFname2,C3[FirstName],0p  pThis obviously doesnt work but is there a way to do thisp  pThanks in advance, Nimip

Negative 402 pI am trying to automate HandbrakeCLI using C via the System.Diagnostics.Process class. However, as long as my program is trying to run the process, it seems like the process never advances.p  pHere is my process setupp  precodeProcess process  new System.Diagnostics.Process ProcessStartInfo startInfo  new System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo startInfo.RedirectStandardOutput  true startInfo.RedirectStandardError  true startInfo.UseShellExecute  false startInfo.CreateNoWindow  true startInfo.FileName  parameters.HandbrakeLocation startInfo.Arguments  arguments  process.StartInfo  startInfo process.Start  string output  string.Empty while output  process.StandardOutput.ReadLine  null      Debug.WriteLineoutput  process.WaitForExit codepre  pHandbrakeCLI.exe does appear in my processes list. The Debug.WriteLineoutput line continually prints out Encoding task 1 of 1, 0.00  and the process never completes. If I kill my C app then HandbrakeCLI instantly shoots up from 7,000k in memory to 145,000k and then does the encoding that I want it to do. Its like my C app is holding it back.p  pI have tried to use Read instead of ReadLine and I have tried flushing the StandardOutput stream before and after the read with no success. I have a suspicion that since HandbrakeCLI overwrites stdout when it writes the encoding progress, that it wont act like a normal process when automated via C.p

Negative 402 pIm pretty new to PyMC and Im trying desperately to infer the parameters of an underlying gaussian distribution that best fits a distribution of observed data that I have, not with a prebuild normal distrubution, but with a more general method using histograms of the simulated data to build pdfs. But so far I cant get my code to converge, and I dont know why...p  pSo heres a summary of what my code does.p  pI have a dataset of 5000 points distributed normally mean5,sigma2. I want to retrieve these values mean, sigma with a bayesian inference using MCMC.p  pI have a data simulator that generates for each iteration of the MCMC process a normal distribution of 5000 points with a random mean and sigma uniform prior From the simulated distribution of points I compute a numpy histogram normed to 1 representing the pdf of the distribution Nbinsintsqrt5000. I then compute the mean and standard deviation of this distribution. What I want is the set of parameters that will allow me to build a simulated distribution that best fits the observed data.p  pI use the most general definition of the log likelihood, that isp  pln Lxlnfxi the likelihood function being defined as the probability distribution of the observed data given the parameters p  pThen I interpolate linearly the histogram values for every bin center. Therefore I have a continuous pdf for the simulated distribution. So here f is the interpolated function I made from the histogram of the simulation. I sum the logfxi contributions for every real data point and return the loglikelihood value at the end. p  pBut some real data points are so far off the mean of the simulated distribution that fxi0. For these points the code raises a math domain error Reminder log0inf. So I artificially set the pdf to a small epsilon for the points where its usually set to 0. p  pBut heres the thing. The loglikelihood is not computed for every iteration. And actually it is not computed at all, in the present architecture of my code. So thats why the MCMC process is not converging. But... I dont know why.p  pTurns out that building custom likelihood functions does not seem to be very casual approach in the PyMC community, where people usually prefer to used prebuilt distributions.
