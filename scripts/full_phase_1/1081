Positive 1081 pWe have an applet that performs file validations in our application. The user selects a File size about 280 Mb and the applet executes a lot of validations the advantage here is that the applet executes the validations clientside, so the file is not uploaded to the server. If the validation is okay, the user clicks an upload button and the file is uploaded to the server.p  pThe problem is that applets are not supported for the newest browsers, so we need an upgrade of our application.p  pHow can we access the user file system from the browser without using an appletp

Positive 1081 pSo Im trying to get a forumlike webpage for my webpage class. The curriculum is just basic HTML and CSS. However, since I have some programming experience, I want to create a forum sort of page. But to do that, I need some way to store data after the HTML has run and retrieve that data later like for usernames and passwords and such. The way I see it I have 3 options but none of them are working.p  pIm really stuck here so Id really appreciate some guidance or a some way to get the applet to work or possibly an easy way to get a php server at school that would be awesome.p  pEdit I want to more focus on letting a java applet read and write files without signing it. Is there any way to do this I put it on the site exception list, and the applet can do basic stuff, but wont work if I try to make it read and write files using data entered by the getParameter method. Can I get a sample that will do sop
Positive 1081 pIve made a Swing GUI calculator app at the moment  wrote the code, mashed it all together into a runnable JAR file, and have a nice little icon to top it off too.p  pMy question is this can you embed a Swing GUI like that into a webpage, or will I need to modify it, or is it a completely different set of rulesp  pIt would be that you could just go to the page and, provided your browser supports Java, the applet would just be there.p  pIve read that the answer revolves around an applet, I think I was wondering if this would have ramifications on ditching all of the Swing components I had built.p  pThanks for any adviceapproachesanswers providedp

Positive 1081 pI am trying to make a GUI for a battleship game. One class is for creating the GUI itself and a second class is on top of it to manage the board in the game. My problem is that the JPanel creates twice once a mouse click happens the mouse click is supposed to be where one is firing in the game and then marks that as a hitmiss. Im not sure why it is creating twice.

Positive 1081 pI am trying to debug client side applet with intellij, I have configured remote debugging in the IDE for local host and added the parameters in java console, now when I start the applet from local browser I can connect with the debugger, and even it stop in a breakpoint, but after few seconds even if I do nothing,I get a message in the IDE console that the connection was disconnected and I cant connect again until I close and open the applet.  what can I do to make this work properlyp
Positive 1081 pI have a small doubt. When we implemement more than one listeners on an applet, is a seperate thread created for each listener implemented apart from the applet thread Or only one thread created for all the listenersp

Positive 1081 pWith NPAPI being faced out by Chrome, Weve been trying to find a good alternative to an Applet we had for printing checks and invoices. There are many options, like NaCl and PNaCl from chrome with PPAPI however those really mean settling for chrome, which isnt a really good idea. Jumping from solution to solution weve found that it is possible to print absolute positions from HTML, like sop  precodelthtml stylefontfamily courier new fontsize 11ptgt ltbodygt     ltdiv stylepositionabsolute left129mm top25mmgtltlt.,gtgtltdivgt lt PLCPOSICIONMTO gt     ltdiv stylepositionabsolute left30mm top38mmgtamp60amp60amp60amp62amp62amp62ltdivgt lt PLCPOSICIONBENEFICIARIO gt     ltdiv stylepositionabsolute left40mm top44mmgtltltltlt.,gtgtgtgtltdivgt lt PLCPOSICIONMTO1 gt     ltdiv stylepositionabsolute left20mm top56mmgtltdivgt lt PLCPOCISIONFECHA gt     ltdiv stylepositionabsolute left82mm top56mmgtltdivgt lt PLCPOCISIONANO gt     ltdiv stylepositionabsolute leftmm topmmgtltdivgt     ltdiv stylepositionabsolute leftmm topmmgtltdivgt  ltbodygt codepre  pp  pThis is an example i made to test if the position works, those attributes will come from a DataBase. It all seems to work, however when trying to print from chrome to a dot matrix printer, the preview looks weirdly zoomed in, and doesnt print correctly, but when I print to a PDF and then to the Dot Matrix or from firefox it works like it shoul somewhat. The page design in the Chrome Preview looks weird too, when the page is in portrait mode, it lookes squared, but in landscape mode it lookes as it should in vertical and it seems to work fine until i print, where it prints as in landscape mode and not like the preview shows. p  pDoes anybody have any idea why this is happening. Or is there another solution that doesnt force me to use chrome alone as he companys browser. p
Positive 1081 pI have a Java applet in my web application that I startup by setting the innerHTML of a div element with a applet element. It starts the applet and executes the code within the applet. The problem is that while it executes the applet code start method the browser IE11 freezes and gives the message domain.com is not responding due to a longrunning script and a button next to it that allows the user to stop the script. If the user waits long enough the message disappears and the applet code is executed fine. I never had this issue before and the application is running for some time 2 years now. Anyone knows what the problem might bep

Positive 1081 pI made an applet that displays a picture, and want to load that applet inside a Frame.  I have been unable to figure out or find online the correct way to implement the AppletStub interface so the Frame and access the applets getDocumentBase and getCodeBase methods.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Here are the three classes  the MyGame applet, the Frame Im trying to put the applet into, and the AppletStub interface.  I think the problem lies in the AppletStub interfaces methods where it returns the applets getDocumentBase and getCodeBase, but Im not entirely sure.

Positive 1081 pIve been trying to figure out how to replace a Java Applet we use to quickly print invoices so it uses Webstart instead.  My question is, can you call a webstart java application and pass it a parameter from the browser  As an example, once an invoice has been completed and paid, when the user clicks a print link, we called the java applet and passed it a link to the pdf print of the invoice and it would simply send it to the default printer without asking any questions.p  pSince Google has killed Java today, weve been moving all of our customers to Firefox but worried that its only a matter of time before they make the same dumb move and we need to find a solution.p  pP.S. If there is a way to accomplish a quick print method without JAVA Im all ears.  Been looking for that for years though so assuming it doesnt exist.p  pThanks,p  pGlennp

Positive 1081 pAt the moment we have developed a system that can digitally sign documents using a java applet. However with the ban of applets under chrome we are looking for an alternative solution for digital signing.p  pAt the moment the signing works the following way p  ol liA HTTP GET is sent to a servlet to get the document that is going to be signedli liThe applet gets started, the digital signature driver gets extracted from the file system and the user enters the PINli liThe applet gets the certification chain, checks CRLsOSCP and signs the documentli liThe applet sends a multipart post with the already signed file to a servlet in the system.li ol  pOne alternative solution would be to import the certificate in the browser and use js to do the signing. But that wont be an user friendly solution.p  pAnother solution could be to ask the user to download a run a program using JNLP that downloads and signs the document and automatically uploads it using HTTP multipart POST. The drawback of this approach would be it requires additional user interactions the download action and we lose browser http session, so we have to authenticate again.p  pWhich is more viable Can you think of alternativep

Negative 1081 pI have a class that serializes a set of objects using XML serialization that I want to unit test.p  pMy problem is it feels like I will be testing the .NET implementation of XML serialization, instead of anything useful.

But how should I do thisp  pIf I throw an exception from the codeAdmincode constructor, will that stop the sub class extending it from being created is there a better way to do this anyone who has used MVC before, have you dealt with something like this beforep

Negative 1081 pIm working on a .NET 4 project, and would be able to benefit from the dynamic property access that a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comKBcsHyperPropertyDescriptor.aspxHyperDescriptora provides, but it doesnt seem to be working properly when built in .NET 4.

While it builds, and the sample executes correctly, the timings show that dynamic property access with HyperDescriptor is the emslowestem possible way of gettingsetting object values.p  pThis problem is only when you build HyperDescriptor from source with .NET 4.

Negative 1081 pI need a good way to programmatically set the Pages per Sheet setting when printing.p  pI know that a user can select this option via a printer settings dialog and that I could make such a dialog display if I wanted to. But in the context of the program Im working on, I need this to be selected by the software itself without requiring to user to delve into the printer settings.p  pWhile it appears I can ask Windows if a printer supports this using the codedmNupcode member of the codeDEVMODEcode structure, there doesnt seem to be any official way to actually set it for the current print job.p  pObviously, one solution would be to alter the printing algorithm in my software so that it lays out the pages appropriately on the device context to get multiple pages per sheet in the resulting output. However, I havent seen any simple way to do that which doesnt require significant changes throughout all of the code that draws to the printer device context. For various reasons, I would rather avoid massive code changes.p  pAnother solution is to install multiple copies of the printer in Windows while directing them all to the same printer port. Each copy of the printer is set with a different default Pages per Sheet. Then the software can select the appropriate printer and the end result is as if it had programmatically selected the necessary pages per sheet option. However, I have encountered various problems with this scheme, and so I am looking for an alternative that would be less of a support burden.p  pa hrefhttpwww.expertsexchange.comProgrammingSystemWindowsProgrammingA2090HowtosetPagesPerSheetProgrammaticallyforNUpPrinting.html relnofollowThis articlea offers another possible solution manipulating the appropriate byte in the private driver data that follows the official DEVMODE structure. The problem is that there is no guarantee that any particular printer driver actually uses the same byte, and I need to support essentially any printer that could reasonably by used in an office environment. It would seem my software would need a configuration where I could specify different byte offsets for drivers that dont use the default. This could be a rare occurrence or a frequent headache depending how many printer drivers have decided to use different bytes for this setting.p  pSo here are my questionsp  ul liDoes anyone have any realworld experience using the last technique of manipulating private driver data How well does it hold up when dealing with various printers from various manufacturersli liAre there any other techniques that I have overlookedli liIf nothing else, then are there any simple ways to take code that draws text, lines, graphics, etc to the printer device context and somehow force it to scale, move, and possible rotate for 2 pages per sheet the output to the necessary location in the device context without writing all of the code and without losing 1pixel wide linesli ul  pNote For what its worth, the program Im working on is using C and MFC. However, all of this should be equally applicable to any program that deals with device contexts and the rest of the Windows API itself.p

Negative 1081 pIve been asked to patch a few minor flaws in a game of the unreal series. It uses the unrealscript language which produces bytecode in a similar way to Java.p  pOne of the issues is that its possible to edit any packages downloaded to a client and insert a codegotocode instruction to jump over important bits of code.p  pIt isnt possible to prevent this so Im wondering what sort of strategies could be applied to make the task more difficult. Theres two approaches that come to mindp  ol lipAn automatic internal state checking mecanism for anything that is clientside. The way it be done would be to have a before and after check for each function call. One peculiarity of the language is the a hrefhttpwiki.beyondunreal.comLegacy3aUnrealScriptLanguageReferenceFunctionsFunctionParameterSpecifiers relnofollowouta keyword in functions.p  blockquote   pThe out specified lets you tell a   function that it should actually   modify the variable that is passed to   it, rather than making a local copy.   This is useful, for example, if you   have a function that needs to return   several values to the caller. You can   just have the caller pass several   variables to the function which are   out values.p blockquoteli lipA serverside checking mecanism that takes action if something incoherent happens or there is a timeout.

Negative 1081 pI have a map application using an inhouse map engine on Android. Im working on a rotating Map view that rotates the map based on the phones orientation using the Sensor Service. All works fine with the exception of dragging the map when the phone is pointing other than North. For example, if the phone is facing West, dragging the Map up still moves the Map to the South versus East as would be expected. Im assuming translating the canvas is one possible solution but Im honestly not sure the correct way to do this.p  pHere is the code Im using to rotate the Canvasp  precodepublic void dispatchDrawCanvas canvas      canvas.saveCanvas.MATRIXSAVEFLAG      mHeading is the orientation from the Sensor     canvas.rotatemHeading, origin[X],origin[Y]       mCanvas.delegate  canvas     super.dispatchDrawmCanvas     canvas.restore  codepre  pWhat is the best approach to make dragging the map consistent regardless of the phones orientation  The sensormanager has a remapcoordinates method but its not clear that this will resolve my problem.  p

Negative 1081 pI use Entity Framework 4 and ASP.NET MVC 3.

The system has an invoicing component for example, where certain actions depend on users, customers, work orders, work order line items, invoices, invoice line items, taxes, etc.p  pWhat strategies do people used to refactor effectively when it comes to dependency overload Im thinking of splitting one service into many services and to remove the 1to1 attempt between services and controllers. But then dependencies at the controller level will increase. Splitting one controller into many controllers is possible with the prior suggestion, but I dont believe thats done unless you break views into partial views I realize this is a broad question, but Im more looking for guidance than exact answers. Feel free to provide links to articles or examples of similar refactoring.p

Negative 1081 pI have a workbook set up where the first tab contains a list of parameters. Each column is a set of parameters for a different instance.p  pI then have a template sheet for one instance, and the user makes many copies of this template. One of the things the template does is dynamically pull over the parameters from the first sheet. The user enters a column number 1 to n and that column of parameters is pulled from the first sheet to be used on that instance. The instance then has runs hundreds of thousands of rows calculations using those parameters.p  pstrongParameters Sheetstrongp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comEMhJx.png altenter image description herep  pstrongSample Instancestrongp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comAMTCd.png altenter image description herep  pMy problem appears to be related to volatility. With a large number of instances, if I use offset or indirect to get the parameters, any change in any cell in the workbook causes the parameters to be reretrieved on each instance sheet, and so each sheet recalculates in its entirety every time, freezing the workbook for about 3 seconds whenever a change is made.p  pI thought I could lessen this by using Index. Each sheets parameters reference the row on the first sheet containing that parameter, with the column number to pull from as the index parameter. This solved the problem of any change causing a recalculation. Now only changes in the parameter ranges cause a recalculation, but for some reason, its much much worse.p  pNow, changing a random cell in the workbook no longer causes the whole thing to freeze for 3 seconds while it recalculates, but changing a emrelevantem cell in the parameters range will cause each sheet to recalculate, and take about 10 seconds. Why is this method so much slower. It should technically be doing the same thing as before, just only when a relevant parameter is changed.p  pIs there any way to set this up so that when a parameter on the front sheet is changed, only the sheets that are affected by emthat parameterem recalculatep  pstrongSolutionsstrongp  pIve considered a complex solution involving VBA, whereupon copying the template instance monitors its Instance Number cell. When its changed, VBA code could copy the corresponding parameters to the sheet and hard copy the values here. I would also need VBA monitoring the change event on the main parameters sheet. When anything is changed, it would have to check the column number, iterate over all templates, and recopying the values if that instance number is referenced. I want to avoid this solution for the usual reasons of keeping VBA out of the equation, but it might be necessary if theres no way to make excel recalculation smarter about changes to parameters.p

Negative 1081 pWhat data structures do I use to implement the following logicp  ol liread is an asynchronous method that queues some workloadli liOnly one workload may run at a time.li liThe first thread to queue a workload becomes the worker thread. It processes all work on the queue before returning. The next thread to invoke read becomes the new worker thread, and so on...li liIf other threads invoke read while a worker thread is processing the queue, they simply add to the end of the queue and return immediately.li ol  pI know how to implement this using a ConcurrentLinkedQueue and AtomicBoolean but I get the feeling there is a better way.p  pstrongCLARIFICATIONstrong A workload consists of invoking another asynchronous method called read2. read2 is asynchronous but is not threadsafe. When I say a worker thread processes the workload it simply fires the first read operation and returns right away. When read2 completes, it invokes the next operation on the queue and so on. The entire API is asynchronous. As such, Id like to avoid a dedicated consumer thread theres no real need for it and its bad for scalability.p

Negative 1081 pI am building an app with a reusable numeric keyboard. The keyboard has been placed in its own XML file so it can be included where needed throughout the app. I want to split the screen for the current activity into two pieces, the fixed size numeric keyboard at the bottom and a RelativeLayout RL above with the rest of the controls. p  pThe problem is, the RL isnt behaving itself.

other words when the keyboard is included at the top, all is fine but the keyboard is in the wrong place but when I include the keyboard at the bottom, the keyboard does not show and the RL takes up the entire screen.p  pHelp This kind of inconsistency drives me nuts and I am on the verge of hurling the computer across the room.p  pThe activitys XMLp  precodeltLinearLayout

My question here is this. If Apple say to run this code after the user is authenticated why it is checking for invitation or users to invite As far as I see, users were not invited yet.

I p  pAfter searching over the internet I understood that, it comes because I am corrupting the memory. Either writing data in array out of bounds Yes, I am using big array, but I am checking explicitly before accessing every element in the array or accessing an illegal heap memory. But as the code is huge, I could not figure it out just looking at it. So I turned to ValGrind for this to see where memory corruption is happening. I ran the code with ValGrind, it runs well till sequential part of the code, but when it comes to parallel part Pthread creation part, It is not doing any thing. With the help of top H p pid I see that all threads are created, but they are in sleep mode. The original code without valgrind does not hang which I ran for a long time But I cannot give guarantee that it is deadlock free. Is using Helgrind Thread error detector of valgrind any usefulp  pCan anyone point me to the document or similar issue. It is ValGrind version 2. Machine is i686, Linux operating system.p  pThanks D.

Negative 1081 pFurthering my study of database use in python, I have come up with the following code based on Bryan Moyles excellent examplep  precodefrom os   import system as cmd from time import sleep  as sleep try     from sqlite3 import dbapi2 as sqlite except ImportError     from pysqlite2 import dbapi2 as sqlite  class searchdb     def initself, db, name         self.db  dbconnection         self.name  name         self.dbc  self.db.cursor      def getitemself, item         self.dbc.executeselect  from s limit s, 1  self.name, item         return self.dbc.fetchone  def search     customerid   []     customerids  searchdbdbconnection, customers     for i in range10000         if not None in strcustomerids[i] customerid.appendcustomerids[i]     return customerid   init  dbname  customers dbconnection  sqlite.connectprogram.db dbcurs  dbconnection.cursor  search codepre  pSure, its nothing fantastic, and I know I could probably optimise it a tad more but as you can see, Ive been trying hard to figure out how to search the database. I managed to retrieve entries that contain information in the database, which pulls out an entry number. I was thinking of using if loops to search the appended list values for a GGSemnumberem entry, then using regular expressions to extract the line number  then printing the information relevant to the customer that the GGS number applies to. Has anyone got any ideas how I could do this in a better way Also, I have a for i in range10000, is there a more optimised form of thisp

Negative 1081 pIs it possible to use a Lucene SpanQuery to find all occurrences where the terms red green and blue all appear within a single sentencep  pMy first incompleteincorrect approach is to write an analyzer that places a special sentence marker token and the beginning of a sentence in the same position as the first word of the sentence and to then query for something similar to the followingp  precodeSpanQuery termsInSentence  new SpanNearQuery   SpanQuery[]      new SpanTermQuery new Term MYSPECIALSENTENCETOKEN,     new SpanTermQuery new Term red,     new SpanTermQuery new Term green,     new SpanTermQuery new Term blue,   ,   999999999999,   false   SpanQuery nextSentence  new SpanTermQuery new Term MYSPECIALSENTENCETOKEN  SpanNotQuery notInNextSentence  new SpanNotQuerytermsInSentence,nextSentence codepre  pThe problem, of course, is that codenextSentencecode isnt really the emnextem sentence, its emanyem sentence marker, including the one in the sentence that codetermsInSentencecode matches. Therefore this wont work.p  pMy next approach is to create the analyzer that places the token before the sentence that is embeforeem the first word rather than in the same position as the first word. The problem with this is that I then have to account for the extra offset caused by codeMYSPECIALSENTENCETOKENcode. Whats more, this will particularly be bad at first when Im using a naive pattern to split sentences e.g. split on code.s[AZ09]code because Ill have to account for all of the false sentence markers when I search for emU. S. S. Enterpriseem.p  pSo... how should I approach thisp

Negative 1081 pWe have been looking for a soution to our problem for one week and after looking in a lot of similar posts and after reading all the available documentation we havent got a solution.p  pIm going to explain my current situation and I hope someone could help us to solve the problem.p  pWe have developed a Web Service Client in JAXWS, which comunicates with a serverside Web Service in another platform. The comunication is 2 way SSL and we have the CA of the server side, to trust him, and our private certificates to identify in the server side.p  pOur Web Service Client is deployed in a Weblogic 10.3 and when it is going to make a call to the serverside Web Service, we load dinamically the truststore and the keystore which is loaded with just one certificate, because each time we are going to use a different certificate so we cannot use only a static keystore.p  pThe problem is when we are stablishing the connection, negotiating the handshake because Weblogic ignores the truststore and keystore we loaded before the call and only look for the trusted certificates and the private keys in the Weblogics keystores...p  pIf we put our trusted certificate in the truststore of Weblogic and start the comunication again. We begin the handshake, we trust the server side because now Weblogic find the CA in its keystore, but when our Web Service Client has to send the certificate to be trusted by the serverside, the Certificate Chain is empty and we get a BADCERTIFICATE.p  pWe have tried with Apache CXF and JAXWS and the problem is the same, setting the keystores using the System properties and the libraries... So we dont know why our Web Service Client is not capable to send the certificate. It seems Weblogic is not serving them because of some reason, maybe Weblogic configuration, but we dont know.p  pIf someone knows what we can do, plase tell us.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 1081 pI have seen a few questions talk around this topic, but I think Im having a more fundamental lack of how to best use trycatch blocks beyond the most basic examples.  p  pIn this specific case, I have a series of techniques to solve a problem, going from simple to fairly complicated, and what I have in mind is something likep  precodeif zombiekiller gt boardwithnail  failed      if zombiekiller gt machette  failed         if zombiekiller gt shotgun  failed             this gt panic               codepre  pBut instead, I thought it might be a better approach to use a trycatch block so that there is more room for adding on custom subprocesses, such as logging why the technique didnt work, updating a UI to reflect a longer than usual hold time, or whatever.  So I guess it would be something likep  precodetry      zombiekiller gt boardwithnail  catchException e      try          zombiekiller gt machette       codepre  pBut this doesnt feel much better, and given all the blowback others have gotten with the whats better ifelse vs trycatch Im pretty clear that at the very least, there are big differences and reasons to use them.  Which is why Im asking about this use case, because I feel like its best handled by a trycatch, but cant figure out if it feels off because I havent really used them much or because Im not approaching this correctly.p
Negative 1081 pHi guys I have a few questions that I wanted to ask. I an using hostgators business plan hosting on a shared server and when I talked to them about limitations and such they have told me that the limit for sending emails is 500 per hourI think but not too sure maybe 1000, but it doesnt matter. and I think Ill be having problems when my work goes live, so I am thinking to make some kind of scriptPHP that will be monitoring the outgoing emails allow 350 emails to be sent and put the rest on hold until the hour passes and after that send another 350 and so on, and so on.

Negative 1081 pSo i am having a rather severe issue with setting up OpenSSH for passwordless entry on my university supplied computer. p  pThere are 2 main issuesp  pstrong1.strong The default config and knownhosts file created by openSSH upon first use default to the university h directory. This is a local directory so i would need to be connected to the local network or using a VPN which isnt always the case. So the first question is, how can i change where the openSSH looks for knownhosts and config.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comdaTVv.png altenter image description herep  pstrong2.strong The second issue is that when i try to set up passwordless entry. It is that the openssh client tells me that my private key is not protected which is fair enough, but what is the best way to change the permissions because I have tried through windows properties and it is hopeless. p
Negative 1081 pIm still new to ObjectiveC and I recently learned how to make properties, so far so good, but one thing that bothers me is that the setter and getter methods are still publicly available even after the property is made. br  lets say I have the following codep  precode myClass.h interface myClass  NSObject  int startPos  property assign, readwrite, setter  setStartPos, getter  getStartPos int startPos void setStartPos int pos int getStartPos end codepre  pthe implementation file should be rather selfexplanatory, Im not trying to do anything specific. br  Now, I read somewhere, and tried it in practice that if you make a emcategoryem in the implementation file, and add some methods to that, its possible to make those methods invisible aka emprivateem to things outside of the myClass.m file.p  pAlright I think, and decide to try it outp  precodemyClass.m import ltFoundationFoundation.hgt import myClass.h  interface myClass hidden void setHiddenStartPos int hPos int getHiddenStartPos end  implementation myClass hidden void setHiddenStartPos int hPos  startPos  hPos   int getHiddenStartPos  return startPos  end  implementation myClass void setStartPos int Pos  [self setHiddenStartPos Pos]   int getStartPos  return [self getHiddenStartPos] this is to see if I can get the value from the hidden methods through the nonhidden ones  end codepre  pthats all fine, and testing it in emmainem I can see that the methods with hidden in their name are in fact inaccessible, and therefore act as if they are private.p  pThen I tried to add this to the header filep  precodeproperty assign, readwrite, setter  setHiddenStartPos, getter  getHiddenStartPos int codepre  pto see if I could access the hidden methods through the property br  but when I did that, the hidden methods became accessible in emmainem and the whole plan with making the methods only accessible through the property went down the drainp  pSo I ask you, is there a way to make methods inaccessible to anything BUT the property andor the object itselfp  pstrongEditstrong I realize that getters dont usually have get in the name, so please stop commenting on itp  palso to emphasise what I meant I wanted to make properties like in c, where the content of the setters and getters are private to the property itselfp  precodepublic int exampleProperty      set...     get...  codepre  pit doesnt use methods as getters and setters, and therefore the code in the setters and getters are accessible to only the property, strongJUSTstrong like the code within a method is local to the method itselfp

Negative 1081 pI have a UITableView with cells in it, and there are buttons to the right of the Table View, so that when I click one of the buttons it takes the selected TableViewCells label text, and saves it to the array specific to the button that was clicked.  The buttons have different colored text, Green, Blue, Red, Purple, and Orange.  What I want to happen, is when I click one of the buttons it will put a colored circle to the right of the text in the cell.  The color of the circle will depend on what button was pressed.  I feel like you could do something with the accessory view of the cell, but what gets tricky, is when you click another button for that same cell it will put another colored circle in.  I want to be able to show 5 circles if needed and if you click the same button again it will take away the circle you previously added.  Here is a picture of my app with some photoshoped circles to give you an idea. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comJK1eb.png altenter image description herep  pDoes anyone have any ideas or approaches to this problem.  I cant seem to figure out how you would set multiple circles in the accessory view, and how it would effect the text.  Would it move the text over p  pHelp would be much appreciated. p  pThanksp

Negative 1081 pI am using the new Path object of java 7 and I am running into an issue.p  pI have a file storage system with a base directory and I create my own relative path.

Negative 1081 pFrom my understanding, codethrowcode is a primative jvm command.

Is there a built in way to do this, or would it have to be some type of extensionp

Negative 1081 pIm trying to simulate a realistic camera in OpenGL ES, using iPhone camera and data received from gyroscope sensor.

The problem is that when I click on the ShowHide Columns button, the column list does not render on the modal dialog. It renders behind it I have to close the dialog in order to see this list.p  pThe same thing when implemented in a normal pagewithout a modal dialog works absolutely fine. Any idea how to fix this modal dialog problem p
Negative 1081 pIm working on a server and I want to be able to log messages using log4cplus. Up to here nothing too complicated.p  pHowever, I use fork to create a child process each time I receive a connection request. The fork is to make sure that the child processes have their own instance of the database connection.p  pNow Id like to make use of the Logger in the child as well. It works great in the server i.e. I can see the log output in the console and the file as I set it up. But after the fork it looks like it gets lost.p  pThere is a simplified synopsis as it is used nowp  precodelog4cplusPropertyConfiguratordoConfigurefilename log4cplusLogger llog4cplusLoggergetInstancesnap l.logll, Server Started, ffile, fline  ltlt works great ... listen accept ... fork  if child log4cplusLogger llog4cplusLoggergetInstancesnap l.logll, msg, ffile, fline  ltlt does not work codepre  pIm thinking that the logger may be locking the file in the server and thus the children cannot themselves open that same file.

Negative 1081 pIt has been a month now while I am making a robot that would explore an unknown area and would make a 3D map using the Kinect sensor.p  pAs I am a C developer, I am using EmguCV as a wrapper to the OpenCV library to use its functions for the computer vision.p  pFor a certain purpose I would like to use the estimateAffine3D function provided by OpenCV but it has not been added to EmguCV yet.

Negative 1081 pFor the past days, Ive been trying to make a ping pong like game. I have 2 paddles and a ball. All dynamic sprites. Everythings been working well except for one issue Im having. The ball tends to bounce on the same angle at some point. So there would be times when the player can simply move the paddle on a specific part and the game can go on for a while or might be forever, since the ball doesnt change its angular velocity regardless of which part of the paddle it hits. Im using a combination of linear and angular velocity to keep the ball moving like sop  precodeifisPaused  FALSE      worldgtStepdt, 10, 10     forb2Body b  worldgtGetBodyList b bbgtGetNext          if bgtGetUserData  NULL              CCSprite sprite  CCSprite bgtGetUserData             ifsprite.tag  2                              b2Vec2 dir  bgtGetLinearVelocity                 dir.Normalize                 float currentSpeed  dir.Length                 int maxSpeed  60                 float accelerate  vel                  ifcurrentSpeed lt maxSpeed                                      bgtSetLinearVelocityaccelerate  dir                                   sprite.position  ccpbgtGetPosition.x  PTMRATIO,                                       bgtGetPosition.y  PTMRATIO                 sprite.rotation  1  CCRADIANSTODEGREESbgtGetAngle                  Keep sprite from bouncing in a straight angle                 bgtSetAngularVelocitybodygtGetAngle              codepre  pSo my question is, how can I manipulate the angular velocity to keep the ball bouncing on different angles everytime it collides with my paddle Im thinking something like getting the current angular velocity then multiplying it with some value but Im not sure if thats the right way to approach the issue Im having.

Negative 1081 pI am new to javascript and my question might be outrightly stupid. I am not able to get the correct reference for this.p  pI am trying to write a controller object in javascript. The idea here is to make this an interface object where anyone can inherit from its prototype and override the methods for their being.p  pI just want to expose one method process to the object and this method will call all the remaining methods and attributes. I am trying to achieve this by making all the other methods and attributes private by using closures.  this is the sample snippet of my codep  precodevar ViewController  function       var viewName  null     var loadView  functionviewName       console.lognow loading view  viewName  ...         return          process  functionviewName             viewName  viewName             loadViewviewName                   var vController  ViewController vController.processalphaView codepre  pNow this works perfectly fine. But if I want to override the methods PreProcess, loadView, initView and PostProcess using prototype, it doesn work. I tried overriding using the Object.create likep  precodevar vController2  Object.createViewController,     LoadView  functionviewName      some custom implementation   ,   and so forth  codepre  pAnd if I change my implementation to define the methods outside using prototypes also doesnt work.

Negative 1081 pWhat I am trying to do should be simple.  I have never used SSRS variables before, and this is probably a very good solution.  But this is not working currently for me.  I have one parent report with several subreports.  The parent report only returns 6 columns and in this case, just 2 rows.  In both of these rows there is a column called Program, which happens to be the same value for both rows.  Now I want to pass this Program value to one of my subreports.  I dont know why SSRS is not letting me pass this value, but when I configured the parameter values for this subreport, I selected the parent dataset and this Program field.  But when I then try to run the parent report, this subreport has the errorp  precodeData retrieval failed for the subreport, Subreport1, located at IncomingRisk Assessment 25mar13. Please check the log files for more information. codepre  pSo then I figured that I would test this subreport by itself to see if it was the problem.  But when I ran this subreport Risk Assessment 25mar13 with the program value coming from the parent report, it generated 0 records.  However, when I instead selected All Programs, this subreport did display data.  How can I pass values from the parent report dataset to one of these subreports  I tried this expression for the Program parameter value on the subreportp  precodeFieldsprogramprovidingservice.Value codepre  pBut the parent report still has this error or it times out.  Although when I ran this subreport with this same Program value, it rendered in just a few seconds.  So I do not think the subreport is the problem.p  pOne other note is that the parent report has one tablix.  This tablix has one row group, covering the entire tablix.  And this sureport occupies one of these tablix rows.  This row group is grouped on a field from the parent report dataset on the eventlogid field.  However, this subreport does not have eventlogid as one of its parameter values.  p  pBut the parent report dataset does have other values that it sends to the subreport, including the Program field value. And I know that I am sending the correct values from the Parent report to this subreport because I created expressions in a textbox on the parent report to display the first field records from the parent dataset.  These field records are all UNIQUEIDENTIFier values except for one DATETIME value.p  pI have also tried setting the subreport parameter values top  precodeFirstFieldsprogramprovidingservice.Value, DataSetName codepre  pfor each parameter, since there are multiple records in the parent dataset.p
Negative 1081 pI am having a difficult time multiplying elements that are in two arrays.  p  precode    int[] firstArray   1,2,3,4      int[] secondArray   10,20,30,40  codepre  pI need to multiply the first element of the firstArray by each of the elements in the secondArray. Then take the second element of the firstArray by each of the elements in the secondArray, and so on until i have multiplied all of the elements in the first array by each of the elements in the second array.p  pso far I have figured out how to get the first element to do this by building a 3rd arrayp  precode    int[] thirdArray  [4]      for int counter  0 counter lt thirdArray.Length counter      thirdArray[counter]  firstArray[counter]  secondArray[counter]     console.WriteLinethirdArray[counter] codepre  pThis just takes the elements of the first array and directly multiply across to the second element. I should have 16 int results but if I change the thirdArray to [16] there is a out of range exception. if you can help it would be greatly appreciated. p
Negative 1081 pI have a website that needs to act like a scanner  capture a normal image from a webcam and then process that image on the server. If that process fails to extract the required data QR Code, capture another image and keep looping until processing is successful.p  pOn the server side, I can process the string image using various classes  not a problem. p  pOn the client side, I can capture an image using Silverlight. p  pWhich approach is best in getting that string image from client to server for processing I dont even need to send data back to client Silverlight as I could simply Transfer the webpage away when successful but would be ideal if I could get a message back to the Silverlight App to stop so the user can remain on the same page.p  pIs using Silverlight the best way Ive explored the WCF RIA Service option which is completely new to me but that appears only for linking to a database which is not necessary.p  pIm not asking a solution here, just a pointer so I know which road to invest time in learning to meet this requirement. Never looked at JSON before... is that the solutionp  pIm using Visual Studio 2010. Thanks in advancep

And when I do set MaximumMinimum size on them, they prefer to stack themselves...p  pI should precise that I already set the widgetResizable property to True and that if I set it to False, the scroll area is here but then I cant resize my window because the widget keep the same size...p  pHow can I set a maxmin size on my child widgets and keep the scroll area.p  pPS  Here is what Ive read on the doc of QScrollArea, but I dont understand it... But it seems to correspond to my case p  pIf a scroll area is used to display the contents of a widget that contains child widgets arranged in a layout, it is important to realize that the size policy of the layout will also determine the size of the widget. This is especially useful to know if you intend to dynamically change the contents of the layout. In such cases, setting the layouts size constraint property to one which provides constraints on the minimum andor maximum size of the layout e.g., QLayoutSetMinAndMaxSize will cause the size of the scroll area to be updated whenever the contents of the layout changes.p

Negative 1081 pIm using PHP 5.2.17. I want to remove some surplus data from a JSON string and Ive thought I can use some replace function to do so. Specifically Im using eregreplace with the next expressionp  precode.createdat codepre  pWhich Ive validated at a hrefhttpwww.regexpal.com relnofollowhttpwww.regexpal.coma. Ive pasted my JSON string in there and the match is right. However, when I make the callp  precodetweets  eregireplace.createdat, temp, something codepre  pand then I echo the tweets variable, theres output. No errors in console neither. Apache error log, however, complains about an error called REGBADRPT. Theres a comment in the php docs of eregireplace suggesting this can be due to I need to escape special characters, but Ive already escaped the  character. And Ive tried to escape others but no different behavior.p  pWhere could the problem be thenp
Negative 1081 pI have a project with multiple files..

Negative 1081 pI have two functions, codeacode and codebcode, that both have specific, fixed strongloadruntimestrong addresses. I am compiling codeacode myself, while codebcode is already provided e.g. in ROM.p  pThe file codea.ccode is as followsp  precodeextern void bvoid  void avoid      b  codepre  pThis generates the following assembly codep  precode00000000 ltagt    0   08000000       j 0 ltagt                        0 RMIPS26 b    4   00000000       nop codepre  pSo its putting a 26bit relocation to codebcode there the target of the call is a 26bit offset from the address of the call instruction itself. Lets say the specific addresses of codeacode and codebcode are 0x80001000 and 0x80002000, respectively. That should be fine codebcode is easily within reach of codeacode.p  pSo in my linker script, I have something like thisp  precodeSECTIONS      a  0x80001000     b  0x80002000      .text  AT0x80000000          .text       codepre  pHowever, linking codea.ocode with this script gives me the following errorp  precodea.o In function a .text0x0 relocation truncated to fit RMIPS26 against b codepre  pPresumably, this is because the linker is trying to fit the full 32bit value code0x80002000code into the 26bit space for the target of the jump. Whats wrong with my linker scriptp
Negative 1081 pNew to Telerik Mvc, so Im hoping Im missing the obvious here.  I am using version 2011.3.1115.340 of Telerik Mvc.

Negative 1081 pIve checked a lot of sites and answers and I cant find any solutions specific to my problem.p  pI dont need to change the schema for my Core data model, all I need is to modify add some content to the current backing SQL Database. p  pAny direction on this will be welcome. Thanks.p  pPS I tried Apple docs and they were about as useful to me as sunshine on Mecury. p  pAlso go easy please, Im a beginner. p  pThanks. p  pUPDATEp  pTo shed more light on my issue, my app works as thus. I have preloaded static information on the app that cant be changed by the user, each day has new content. Every month, I push an update with entirely new content specific to that month. However, when my app entered production, upon the update I pushed for this month, my users were complaining that they couldnt access the months data. This led to me spamming them with Push notifications to have them delete the app and do a fresh install to access the new data. p  pHow can I fix this issue my schema stays the same, only the data changes. p
Negative 1081 pI have been working on an iOS, OpenGLbased app for the past few months. During this time, I have created both the main UIWindow and a single UIView in code, as opposed to using a storyboard.  An important item to note is that I create an instance of EAGLView used in many Apple examples, which inherits from UIView.p  pThe code base I am working with is quite extensive, and among other things, it uses a separate rendering thread.  Ill come back to this point near the end of this post.p  pWith this in mind, I am now at the point that I want to add native UI support.  To do this, I am using a storyboard for the first time.  My current setup consists of a mainroot view with two buttons.  Each button uses a modal segue to place a new view on the screen.  p  pTo reuse as much code as possible, I have specified that the views I segue to are of type EAGLView as opposed to UIView.  The only change Ive had to make is that instead of initializing with initWithFrame, I now initialize with initWithCoder.p  pOther than moving to a storyboard, nothing else in the code base has changed.  However, when I segue to an EAGLView, nothing renders  all I see is white.  I am hesitant to use GLKit because it duplicates much of the functionality I have already written I had everything rendering just fine prior to using a storyboard.  In addition, GLKit provides a callback for rendering, whereas, I have a separate render thread.p  pMy scenario sounds a lot like this postp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7265594opengliosviewdoesnotpaintOpenGL iOS view does not paintap  pI have GL error checks for every call or for every group of calls, and no errors are being reported.  Whats even stranger is that when I capture an OpenGL ES frame for debugging in Xcode, the debugger actually shows the content I expect to see.p  pAny ideas here  I am stumped.p

Negative 1081 pI am rewriting an iPad drawing application with OpenGL ES2 instead of Core Graphics.  I have already written a subclass of GLKView that can draw line segments and I can just drag a GLKView in my storyboard and set it a custom class. So far, drawing works, but I also want to implement layers like in Photoshop and GIMP. p  pI thought of creating multiple GLKViews for each layer and letting UIKit handle the blending and reordering, but that wont allow blend modes and may not have a good performance. p  pSo far, I think doing everything in one GLKView is the best solution. I guess I will have to use some kind off buffer as a layer. My app should also be able to handle undoredo, so maybe I will have to use textures to store  previous data.p  pHowever, I am new to openGL so my question is How should I implement layersp

Negative 1081 pIve hacked away at a stopwatch script to make it useable in several iterations in my HTML form.

Negative 1081 pI am currently working on a video to video application, which uses the VLCJ api 2.2.0 for the media streaming.

Negative 1081 pIve got a many to many relationship between my employees and groups table. Ive created the pivot table, and all is working correctly with that. However, Ive got a sortOrder column on my employees table that I use to determine the order in which they display.

Or backwards if sorted descending The sortOrder column is a integer column that allows null values.p  pIve set up my group model to sort the employees by the sort column, but Ive run into a problem. The null values always are displayed first. Ive tried using ISNULL and similar SQL methods in place of the regular asc or desc used, but I only get an error.p  pHeres the code in my Group modelp  precodeclass Group extends Eloquent   public function employees              return thisgtbelongsToManyEmployeegtorderBysortOrder, asc       codepre  pAnd heres what I use in the controller to access my modelp  precodeboard  Groupfind6gtemployees codepre  pWhats the trick in Laravel to sorting NULL values lastp

Negative 1081 pI have a UIScrollView with 2 subviews. Id like one subview to be leadingaligned leftaligned where its leading edge lines up with the leading edge of the scrollview. Id like the other subview to be trailingaligned rightaligned where its trailing edge lines up with the trailing edge of the scrollview. p  pFor some reason, autolayout keeps unexpectedly placing the second, trailingaligned subview outside the bounds of the scrollview, to the leading left side of the other subview, such that the subviews trailing edge lines up with the leading edge of the scrollview. p  pIm trying to do this programmatically. Code is below. Im using 2 labels for the 2 subviews. The alpha label is correctly leadingaligned, but the beta label is not trailingaligned as it should be.p  pThis also happens if I try using left and right alignments instead of leading and trailing.

Negative 1081 pI have a following situation. I created a simple backend in Flask that handles file uploads. With files received, Flask does something uploads them, and returns the data to the caller. There are two scenarios with the app, to upload one image and multiple images. When uploading one image, I can simply get the response and voila, Im all set.p  pHowever, I am stuck on handling multiple file uploads. I can use the same handler for the actual file upload, but the issue is that all of those files need to be stored into a list or something, then processed, and after doing that, a single link album containing all those images, needs to be delivered.p  pHere is my upload handling codep  precodeapp.routeuploadv3, methods[POST] def upload     if request.method  POST         datafile  request.files[file]         filename  datafile.filename         pathtosaveto  os.path.joinapp.config[UPLOADFOLDER], filename         datafile.savepathtosaveto         fileurl  uploadimagetoimagehostpathtosaveto         return fileurl codepre  pI was experimenting with strongsessionstrong in flask, but I dont know can I create a list of items under one key, like session[links], and then get all those, and clear it after doing the work. Or is there some other simpler solution p  pI assume that I could probably do this via key for each image, like session[link1], and so on, but that would impose a limit on the images depending on how much of those I create, would make the code very ugly, make the iteration over each in order to generate a list that is passed to an album building method problematic, and session clearing would be tedious.p  pSome code that I wrote for getting the actual link at the end and clearing the session follows this assume that session[link] has a list of urls, which I cant really achieve with my knowledge of session management in Flaskp  precodedef createalbumimages     session.poplink, None     newalbum  im.createalbumimages     return newalbum.link  app.routegetalbumlink def getalbumlink     return createalbumsession[link] codepre  pThanks in advance for your timep

Negative 1081 pstrongThe issuestrong I have a single page with two email forms one codeltformgtcode, two divs inside this which look like forms to the user. When you submit either form, the C behind looks at the values of the form and sends them in an email. This works well, and now I want a little validation, but I cant add coderequiredcode attributes to the codeinputscode as the code doesnt know its two separate forms and needs to handle the coderequiredcode attributes separately for each one.p  pI understand why this issue occurs, but I want to know if theres a way to tell the page to handle the coderequiredcode attributes in groups.p  pstrongWhat Ive triedstrong Both forms are handled by the code behind, and so need to be run serverside, so separate codeltformgtcode elements wouldnt work. I have tried nesting the forms as codeltformgtcode elements inside the serverside codeltformgtcode, which separates the coderequiredcode attributes as desired, but seemingly breaks a number of things and Ive read this is generally bad practice anyway.p  pstrongWhat Im not askingstrong To validate the form in the code behind.p  pstrongEditstrong Davids answer works great to validate groups of textboxes, which is what I needed.p  pTo additionally validate a checkbox, I used javascript. codeonclientclickcode we can check if the codecheckboxcode is checked AND validate using codePageClientValidatevalidationgroupcode and then return true, else return false. codeonclickcode is only fired when codeonclientclickcode returns true.p

When the input is valid, I set the EditTexts right Drawable to my custom input is valid icon, which I modified to have the same size as Androids indicatorinputerror.png, for consistency sake.p  pStill, I dont like this approach e.g. in future versions, the indicatorinputerror.png icon might be different and I cant understand why do I keep getting the default icon when the codeFragmentcode is recreated. Strangely enough, the first time the codeFragmentcode is recreated, if the EditText validation fails and validateUsername gets called with a nonnull message, I get my custom icon. On the second time and so forth that the codeFragmentcode is recreated, I get Androids default icon. If I input some invalid text, I get my custom icon again, which is very strange.p

The strange thing is that the gallery page loading the same kind of template file to do the wpquery works fine. p  pWhen I change back to the default permalinksetting everything works fine...p  pThanks for any hintp  phere my templateevents.phpp  precodeltphp   Template Name Events  gt  ltphp getheader gt            ltphp           Fix homepage pagination         if  getqueryvarpaged               paged  getqueryvarpaged          else if  getqueryvarpage               paged  getqueryvarpage          else              paged  1                   now  strtotimenow          args  array             posttype gt events,             postsperpage gt 40,             poststatus gt publish,             metakey gt cmbdatetimestamp,             orderby gt metavalue,             order gt ASC,             paged gt paged,             metaquery gt array                 array                     key gt cmbdatetimestamp,                     value gt now,                     type gt NUMERIC,                     compare gt gt                                                               Create a new filtering function that will add our where clause to the query         function filterwhere where                  posts in the last 30 days             where .

Negative 1081 pI have a listview where I show the users some titles and they can access these titles to view the content or they can add this title as favorite to read it later How can I do this favorite button I tried to take the button and if its favorite or not from the database but cant figure out how I can do it... Is there a tutorial or something...p  pWhat Ive done is p  precodeSimpleCursorAdapter adapter new SimpleCursorAdapterthis,R.layout.rating,cu,new String[]Title, Favorites, new int[]R.id.text1, R.id.btrating,CursorAdapter.FLAGREGISTERCONTENTOBSERVER codepre  pwhere title is getting the titles to place in the textview text1 and the favorites is getting true or false to place in an attribute of the button so that if its true the buttonwhich is a star should be on, if its false it should be off.. but here its taking the text and placing it in the text of the button so I am getting a button where its written on false or yfor true how can I fix thisp  pthanks.p

Negative 1081 h2The Issueh2  pIve tested the CoffeeScript and the form makes the call to Stripe, sets the hidden field with the proper response token and submits the form. My issue is that once its submitted the controller doesnt seem to grab the token properly and throws this error strongStripeInvalidRequestError  You must supply either a card or a customer idstrong. p  pNext I tired taking the token that was generated and hard coded it into the controller to see if that would work. I submitted the form, that worked and payment was received on Stripes end. Im pretty much out of ideas on what to try next.

Negative 1081 pIn our company, codegitcode is not supported, only codeTFScode is. In my team however, we all use codegitcode and before using codegittfcode we were using codegittfscode. A few days ago me and another colleague decided to give codegittfcode a try, so we did a codegit tf clone deepcode of our project from codeTFScode. That worked fine and we can see all changesets as separate commits in the treeview.p  pSome of our projects are shared with other teams, so other people will make changes and use only codeTFScode to push their changes. What Ive noticed is that even though Im using codegit tf pull deepcode, all changesets are being bundled in just one commit that contains all the files that were changed. Even if in the TFS history I can see that there were 10 changesets made by the other team in the last day for example. Im only seeing 1 new commit in my history.p  pWhen reading the codegittfcode documentation I see thisp  blockquote   pPullp      pgit tf pull [deep] [rebase] Fetches changes made in TFS as a new   commit in Git, and merges the commit with the latest commit in the   current branch. By default, the fetch performed by the pull command is   shallow, but the deep option may be used to create a Git commit for   each TFS changeset created since the last fetch. Also, merge is used   by default when pulling, but the rebase option may be used to   perform a rebase instead.p blockquote  pWhat am I missing What command do I have to use in order to get each changeset as a new commit on my local codegitcode branchp  pThanks a lot.p

Negative 1081 pIm building an example of google images search. I have a grid of images the search result.

The odd thing is that if you look at the developers tool the html is loaded, but it is not rendered on the screen not completely at least the html has an image whith a global src link, h1, p and a button tag. I say its not completely rendered because the image, although empty, and the button are on the screen, but not the other elements.p  pAn oddest thing is that if you click in another image an loads again the html doc now you have two, Im working on that, this time de happens the same thin except that the image is rendered correctly.p  pOther thing, I think related with this load problem, is that I cant give css properties to any of this loaded elements.p  pHere is my code jqueryp  precodeimg.clickfunction  ltsection idimageSectiongtltsectiongt.prependTobody.loadimageDetail.html placeHolder.attrsrc,httpfillmurray.comg900450 codepre  pp  pAny idea what could be happening herep  p edit p  pFirst of all, thanks for taking some time in reading and answering me.p  pIve discovered that this code does nnt work the same way depending on the browser, which surprises me a bit, because Im testing with lastest versions of Safari, Chrome and FireFox.

Negative 1081 pI am somewhat confused with proper way to handle data abort exceptions on ARM CPU.p  pFor example a hrefhttpinfocenter.arm.comhelptopiccom.arm.doc.ddi0333hDDI0333Harm1176jzsr0p7trm.pdf relnofollowthisa document says that when data abort exception state is entered LR register is set to the address of PC8.  I assume that the 2 instructions following faulty load or store instruction got fetched into the pipeline.  But is it really safe to return to the PC8 address. What if the instruction immediately following faulty load instruction was a branch.  Does it mean that PC register is actually set to the branch destination instruction and not the one that sequentially follows the load instruction.  In this case returning to PC8 will return to some random place in the program  2 steps behind the branch destination  and not to the faulty load instruction.   Am I missing something herep

Negative 1081 pI have some memory leaks and I not quite sure what is causing it, but after some testing, it seems like i screw up at copying my object and its not released properly. Let me tell you first that Im using ARC and not so long ago i didnt know much about copies or advance memory management so there still is a lot to learn for me. Ok lets throw in some details, I have 2 classes Tree and TreeCell.p  pTreep  precodeinterface Tree  NSObjectltNSCopyinggt  Here we have 2D array that stores pointers to TreeCell objects property retain,nonatomicNSMutableArray tree  pointersToTree stores copied pointers from tree,  its the same in terms of content but it have different order of rows and columns property retain,nonatomicNSMutableArray pointersToTree  i dont believe delegate is relevant to my problems since its not copied property weak,nonatomic idlttreeDelagategtdelagate  codepre  pSo in short Tree stores 2 the same pointers to each create TreeCell, one of those in each array.p  pTreeCellp  precodeinterface TreeCell  NSObjectltNSCopyinggt  ancestors and children stores arrays made of 2 NSNubers  property retain,nonatomicNSMutableArray  ancestors property retain,nonatomicNSMutableArray  children  property retain,nonatomicNSNumber boardY property retain,nonatomicNSNumber boardX ... there are some more Integers and Booleans codepre  pAnd here is how copy functions looks like, they are both working but im not sure if they are implemented correctly, so starting with Treep  precodeid copyWithZone NSZone  zone     Tree copy  [[Tree allocWithZone zone] init]      this array will become copy of self.tree     NSMutableArray copyOfTree[[NSMutableArray alloc]init]      loop to go thru all stored TreeCell pointers in self.tree     for NSInteger a0 altself.tree.count a       adding row         [copyOfTree addObject[[NSMutableArray alloc]init]]          for NSInteger b0 blt[self.tree[a] count] b              creating copy of TreeCell and storing pointer to it             [copyOfTree[a] addObject[TreeCellself.tree[a][b] copy]]                   copy.treecopyOfTree     by now we copied whole self.tree and since i have function to create pointersToTree out of it I call it below     [copy creatArryOfPointerRowsself.pointersToTree.count columns[self.pointersToTree[0]count]]      return copy   codepre  pSo what Im trying to get here is deep copy of Tree. Ok here is TreeCell copy functionp  precodeid copyWithZone NSZone  zone      we start here by allocating and setting NSNubers boardY and boardX     TreeCell copy  [[TreeCell allocWithZone zone] initWithLayerself.layer boardXself.boardX andBoardYself.boardY]      after that some integers and booleans are set     copy.helperself.helper     copy.inTreeself.inTree     copy.stableConnectedself.stableConnected     copy.positonself.positon     copy.freeStoregself.freeStoreg      here we are adding arrays containg 2 NSNumbers     for int a0 altself.ancestors.count a          [copy addAncestorWithXself.ancestors[a][0] andYself.ancestors[a][1]]          for int a0 altself.children.count a          [copy addChildWithXself.children[a][0] andYself.children[a][1]]            return copy   codepre  pTo make things clear here is addAncestor function addChildren looks the samep  precodevoid addAncestorWithXNSNumberancestorX andYNSNumberancestorY     if [self.ancestors indexOfObject[NSArray arrayWithObjectsancestorX,ancestorY, nil]]NSIntegerMax      [self.ancestors addObject[NSMutableArray arrayWithObjectsancestorX,ancestorY, nil]]      codepre  pFinally this piece of code that creates memory leakp  precodefor NSInteger a0 alt8000 a           Tree testTree [self.startingTree copy]  codepre  pAt the end of each cycle of this loop testTree should be released, after testing Im 100 sure that dealloc for it is called and its also called for each TreeCell that was stored in tree. But memory usage is constantly increasing. Please tell me where did i go wrong. Some paraboly go and say try serializing it but it doesnt cut it for my.p

Negative 1081 pIm talking about Java, but the concept would apply to other languages p  pWe have two methods on the same class that will have the same basic functionality, but provide different return types. Both methods will get you all the things, but one gets an iterable which can provide access to all things, and one gets a collection which includes all things.p  pWe know you cannot do this because it wont compilep  precodeIterable getThings  Collection getThings  codepre  pSo, does anyone have thoughts about how to name the methods It seems an easy fix to sayp  precodeIterable getIterableOfThings  Collection getCollectionOfThings codepre  pHowever, this is obviously somewhat verbose and perhaps not the best solution.

Negative 1081 pI have a codeDataStructurecode class, which I want to be immutable.p  pOrdinarily, Id just ensure that all my members are defined as codereadonlycode  Job Done. But one of the members is a list of ints, so I need to ensure that the codeListcode cant be modified so I change it to a codeReadOnlyCollectionltTgtcode. Fine.p  pI also need that collection to be ordered in a certain way  again fine, I sort the list accordingly before converting it via code.AsReadOnlycode.p  pSo far, its all been fine.p  pBut the last step is that I want 3 different constructors  each accepting the original data in a different format. Now I have to duplicate the code that converts the list to the necessary format, in each constructor.p  pIf I commonise it out into a codesetListcode method, then the variable cant be codereadonlycode, because its being assigned in a nonconstructor method. Now Ive lost some of the immutability.p  pIdeally, there would be some way that I can declare that the codesetListcode method can only be called from a constructor, and thus is allowed to edit codereadonlycode members, but I dont think that exists.p  pI could create wrap everything in getters and so forth, so that the class is immutable from the outside, but Id rather like it to be immutable from the inside too especially given that I can achieve this is I sacrifice DRYnessp  pDoes anyone have any clever ideas about language features Ive forgotten about that would solve thisp
Negative 1081 pOkay, using Scala Play Framework I have an Action method in my Application Controller that accesses a database for a specific serial and sends a JSON object using Okjson, which can be accessed through the route codeGET jsonserial controllers.Application.getDataserial Stringcode. This part works I am able to retrieve a unformatted JSON objects for specific serial numbers going directly through localhostjsonemserialem. p  pIn my views, there is a page for editing this database information. There is an HTML select drop down with a list of serial numbers, and when one of them is selected Id like to send an AJAX request with that serial number to json and get a JSON object in return. Once I have the JSON object, the forms should be populated with that information so the users know what they are editing. p  pSo essentially my question is how can I use AJAXjQuery to request a JSON object over HTTP using route jsonserial so that I can populate an HTML form with the various fields in the JSON object when a serial is selected from a drop downp  pLet me know if anything is unclear or too ambiguous Thanksp  pEDIT Some Codep  precodeval getDataserial String  Action   val scInfo  some database query val ctrlInfo  another database query val json JsValue  Json.obj         name gt scInfo0.1,         notes gt scInfo0.2,         ctrl1 gt Json.objname gt scInfo0.3,             port gt scInfo0.4,             apc gt scInfo0.5,         ctrl2 gt Json.objname gt ctrlInfo0.1,             port gt ctrlInfo0.2,             apc gt ctrlInfo0.3,         rack gt scInfo0.6,         comtrol gt scInfo0.7           Okjson  codepre  pThis is a picture of what the form will roughly look like I figured seeing the actual page was easier than reading the markupp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comBZAcW.png altFormp  pSo when a Storage Center is selected, that number is sent via AJAX to codejsonserialcode and should request a JSON object as a result, which will then populate the other fields in the form.p  pEDIT 2p  pHeres the markup for the view.

I actually have to check in that package to TFS and have everything available for the solution at build.p  pIve already disabled the Enable NuGet Package Restore and rebuilt, but the dependencies are not being brought in locally anywhere I can tell.p

Negative 1081 pwere showing search results both in a table view and on a map in our app. The user can show a map over the search display controller by tapping on a button. The map is shown by simply moving the map subview to front so that it covers the table view.p  pWhen we attempt to write UIAutomation tests for whether the map view is visible, isVisible on the map view always evaluates to false, even though the map view is clearly visible and we can interact with it. If we never tap the search bar and type into it table not shown then the map view isVisible evaluates to true.

Negative 1081 pSo the issue is we have an openLDAP server for authentication of our NAS drives in the office.

It needs also to be unique globally if the module is to be combined with other modules to create the main app module.

Negative 1081 pI am running rails4 using jruby and postgres as the db. I have a jar file that I call to create an instance of a java object. The java object is a bridge to a backend calculation engine on a different machine. It queries the calculation engine and stores the return values as instance variables. I need to keep a unique instance of this object per session. Is it possible to store instances of the java object in postgres I really have no idea where to start on this and looking on google hasnt helped so any advice is appreciated. Thanks.p

Negative 1081 pI have a native Visual C application which acts as a socket server it accepts incoming TCP connections, and it reads some data from those sockets. Once a new TCP connection is received  accepted by the server, a new thread is spawn, and all reads i.e., calls to recv on that connected socket happen in that separate thread. All communication is done according to a welldefined standard applicationlevel protocol, implemented by several clients by different developersvendors. Hence, my server application is able to communicate with clients by different developersvendors, as long as they comply with this welldefined applicationlevel protocol.p  pNow, my server application works fine with 99.9 of the client applications. Nevertheless, I am experiencing strange delays with just a few clients.p  pIn particular, with these problematic clients, once the client connection has been accepted by my server application, the recv calls in my dedicated receiver thread hang for exactly 5 seconds before returning, even though data shall be available, since the client has already completed several send calls.p  pThe clients connecting to my server application run on hosts residing on the same LAN as the host upon which my server application runs.p  pPlease notice the following factsp  p1  With these specific problematic clients, strongALLstrong recv calls in my server application hang for 5 seconds before returning.p  p2  My server application works fine i.e., recv show no relevant delays with other clients actually, the vast majority of them.p  p3  On the other side, those problematic clients seem to work fine i.e., no particular delays with other thirdparty server applications implementing the same applicationlevel protocol as my own server application. Some of those thirdparty server applications are open source Ive inspected the source code of those thirdparty server applications, but I could not find any relevant difference in their implementation which could apparently justify the 5seconds delay that I am experiencing in my server application.p  pI realize that I described the issue in quite generic terms, but maybe this 5 exact seconds delay may tell something to some TCPIP expert...p  pI would really appreciate any hint or suggestion to troubleshoot this problem.p  pThanks in advance and best regards.p

Negative 1081 pI see that theres an onDisconnect firebase method, however it looks like that method is intended to update other client devices that the current client device has gone offline. For me this isnt very useful. All of our API calls are coming from a central server which handles updates to our other client devices.p  pBasically, I only have 1 client device communicating with the firebase server... ever. So my question is, when that single device loses connection how will I know This is probably the most frustrating part of all, Not only do I not know when I lose connection, but Im still making calls as if  each command is successful. p  pOffline Behaviorp  pEvery client sharing a Firebase maintains its own internal version of any active data. When data is updated or saved, it is written to this local version of the Firebase. The Firebase client then synchronizes that data with the Firebase servers and with other clients on a besteffort basis.p  pAs a result, all writes to Firebase will trigger local events immediately, before any data has even been written to the server. This means the app will remain responsive regardless of network latency or Internet connectivity.p  pOnce connectivity is reestablished, well receive the appropriate set of events so that the client catches up with the current server state, without having to write any custom code.p

But the codeTEMPORARYTABLEcode is dissappearing after disconnecting, and I cannot just add a special section in my bash script just for this one package, cause there could be much more packages, with different number of steps.

Negative 1081 pI apologize for the lengthy question, but I feel like it is necessary to include all of this information.p  pUntil now, Ive been using a possiblyunorthodox way of adding UserControls to my applications.  Lets say I have a UserControl called codeDiagnosticscode that has a button, that when clicked, performs a function that is specific to the application that owns it.  For example, if I drop Diagnostics into AppA, I want it to display A, and if I drop it into AppB, I want AppB to define the behavior so it displays B.p  pI typically implement this via a callback interface that is passed to the UserControls constructor, which is pretty straightforward.  Heres some sample code that probably wont compile, but is presented just to clarify what Ive basically done before, and what I am trying to dop  precodepublic interface IDiagnosticsCallback      void DisplayDiagnostics  implemented by owner of Diagnostics UserControl   public class MyApp  IDiagnosticsCallback      public void DisplayDiagnostics          MessageBox.ShowDiagnostics displayed specifically for MyApp here        public Diagnostics  UserControl      private IDiagnosticsCallback callback  get private set       public DiagnosticsIDiagnosticsCallback callback          callback  callback           public void ShowDiagnosticsClickobject sender, EventArgs e          callback.DisplayDiagnostics       codepre  pThe problem I had in the past was understanding how to declare a UserControl that takes a parameter in its constructor i.e. doesnt have a default constructor in XAML, and apparently you cant.  I worked around this with a fairlyinelegant method  I would give the main panel a name in XAML, and then from codebehind I would create Diagnostics, passing it the necessary callback, and then I would add Diagnostics to the panels list of children.  Gross and violates usage of MVVM, but it works.p  pThis weekend, I decided to try to learn how to do it for a class and a TextBox, and it turns out that all I had to do was to create a codeDependencyPropertycode in my UserControl and use databinding.  It looks emsomethingem like thisp  precodepublic ClassA      public void ShowSomethingSpecial              MessageBox.ShowWatch me dance        public MyApp      public ClassA Foo  get set    public Diagnostics  UserControl      public static readonly DependencyProperty SomethingProperty  DependencyProperty.RegisterSomething, typeofClassA, typeofDiagnostics, new PropertyMetadata      public ClassA Something              get  return MyAppGetValueSomethingProperty          set  SetValueSomethingProperty, value             now uses default constructor      public void ShowSomethingSpecialClickobject sender, EventArgs e              Something.ShowSomethingSpecial         MyApp.xaml ltdiagsDiagnostics SomethingBinding Foo gt codepre  pSo Foo is a property of MyApp, which is databound to the Something DependencyProperty of Diagnostics.  When I click the button in the UserControl, the behavior is defined by ClassA.  Much better, and works with MVVMp  pWhat Id like to do now is to go one step further and instead pass a callback interface to my UserControl so that it can get the states of my digital inputs and outputs.  Im looking for something like thisp  precodepublic Diagnostics  UserControl      public interface IDioCallback              short ReadInputs         short ReadOutputs         void SetOutput char bit           public IDioCallback DioCallbackInterface          get  return IDioCallbackGetValueDioCallbackInterfaceProperty          set  SetValueDioCallbackInterfaceProperty,value             Using a DependencyProperty as the backing store for DioCallbackInterface.  This enables animation, styling, binding, etc...     public static readonly DependencyProperty DioCallbackInterfaceProperty  DependencyProperty.RegisterDioCallbackInterface,typeofIDioCallback,typeofDiagnostics,new PropertyMetadata0  PropertyMetadata is the problem...   public class DIO  IDioCallback      public short ReadInputs  return 0      public short ReadOutputs  return 0      public void SetOutput char bit    public class MyApp       public DIO MyDIO  get set    MyApp.xaml ltdiagsDiagnostics DioCallbackInterfaceBinding MyDIO gt codepre  pWhile my code maybe not the exact code above, but my real project does compile successfully, it appears that the PropertyMetadata passed to Register is at fault.  I get an exception that says Default value type does not match type of property DioCallbackInterface.p  pAm I doing something really unorthodox, or is this approach to databinding interfaces actually possible  If not, what are the recommended ways of defining how a UserControl behaves based on the application its being used inp

Negative 1081 pI came across an interesting problem and was wondering if and how could this be done in Java Create a method which can memoize any functionmethod . The method has the following arguments  the methodfunction and the arguments for it.p  pFor example lets say i have this method p  precodeint addOneint a  return a  1 codepre  pand i call my memoization method two times with the same arguments  addOne and 5 for example, the first call should actually call the addOne method and return the result and also store that result for that given argument. The second time when i call it should know this has been called before and just look up the previous answer.p  pMy idea would be to have something like a codeHashMapltCallable,HashMapltListltObjectsgt,Objectgtgtcode where you would store the previous answers and look them up later on.I think this can be somehow done with lambda expressions but im not that familiar with them.Im not quite sure how to write this method and would appreciate some help.p  pCan this be done with this approach p

Negative 1081 pI know there are many questions asking the same thing, but i get lost when it comes about functions. I am using a php function stored in wordpress functions.php which i can call from template in order to get inside a dropdown all the data stored in a taxonomyp  precodefunction customtaxonomydropdown taxonomy, exclude  array, name,  showoptionall  null    args  array     exclude gt exclude,     order gt order,     hideempty gt 1,     order gt ASC,     echo gt 1  terms  getterms taxonomy, args  name   name   name  taxonomy if  terms     printf ltselect names classpostformgt, escattr name     if  showoptionall       printf ltoption value0gtsltoptiongt, eschtml showoptionall        foreach  terms as term       printf ltoption valuesgtsltoptiongt, escattr termgtslug ,  eschtml term    gtname                print ltselectgt        codepre  pTemplate file where i call the functionp  precode Other func to get the ids of tags and categories to exclude in the dropdown irrelevant noticiasID  getcategoryidNoticias estrenosID  gettagidestrenos proximamenteID  gettagidproximamente peliculasID  gettagidpeliculas   Calling the function of above and writing parameters about taxonomies customtaxonomydropdown category, .noticiasID, category, Select All  customtaxonomydropdown actor, , actor, Select All  customtaxonomydropdown director, , director, Select All  customtaxonomydropdown escritor, , escritor, Select All  customtaxonomydropdown posttag,  .estrenosID.,.proximamenteID.,.peliculasID.,.pendingID.,.pendienteID, posttag, Select All  codepre  pSo, i get some pretty selectable dropdowns with all the taxonomy information. However, how can i pass the selected data in each of the dropdown to the submit action and therefore, click the submit button and get the correct results in my already done search.phpp  precodeltform actionltphp echo homeurl gt methodget classgt ltinput typesubmit valueSubmitgt ltformgt codepre  pstrongEDITstrong  I have obtained the value for every select with codeGETcode and stored it on a variable like codevaluegetcode codecategorygetcode, codedirectorgetcode, etc...p  precodeifissetGET[category]    categoryget  GET[category]  ifissetGET[director]    directorget  GET[director]  ifissetGET[actor]    actorget  GET[actor]  ifissetGET[escritor]    escritorget  GET[escritor]  ifissetGET[posttag]    idiomaget  GET[posttag]  codepre  pEDIT So, by doing the last step i didnt knew if the next one was the codequerypostsquerystringcode, but anyways it didnt help me. Maybe i got confused here. Even when i made an echo of codequerystringcode the query was different and it even was showing the pagename among it. So, although it is the best way to do it, i decided not to go further in there because i have wasted much time on this problem. So, i went by the easy way and decided to pass the variable values obtained by the codeissetGET[taxonomy]code to the codeargscode and query it. It all resulted like thisp  precodecategoryID  getcategoryid.categoryget  Calling function idiomaID  gettagid.idiomaget  to get IDs by name args  array cat gt .categoryID., categoryname gt .categoryget., tag gt .idiomaget., tagin gt .idiomaID., director gt .directorget., escritor gt .escritorget., actor gt .actorget.,  codepre  pThe reason that i included both cat and categoryname was because the two words terms, so its like a fix. codeSelect Allcode option value must not be 0, as it will force all dropdowns to not stay on select all option but to select a different data. In my case, its value wasnt 0 it simply was codecode So, for future references, this is my problem already solved. My solution does not use the query string but uses the values obtained by codeGETcode which i cant consider completely right. The only answer made in this question helped me trough the problem but it didnt help me to pass the variables to the query, so i think i cant select a correct or complete answer here. If anyone else posts how to pass the correct data to codequerystringcode that will be the correct answer.p
Negative 1081 pIve written some signals in my Django app that are supposed to send out an email when a particular model instance is created or modified, but the signal receiver function doesnt seem to be responding at any rate, Im not getting any emails through although I have already checked that Im able to send emails with my current configuration.p  pAnyhow I wondered, is it possible to manually send a postsave signal for debugging purposes, rather than trying to trigger it by creating a new model instance each time Thanksp

Negative 1081 pI am wondering if I have got my thinking write about this, I have calibration done for my camera and now I want to get the angle of detected objects relative to the camera only on the xaxis, the horizontal. I am thinking I can put some grid lines across the image at known pixel values and match those with know real world distances and calculate the angle per pixel that way, knowing the distances of the triangles.  Starting at the centre of the image 0 degrees, and as we move towards the right X degrees and towards the left X pixels.p  pAssuming this is a correct way to go about it, for some reason the video Im working with was recorded at 704x576 pixels, but when I plug the camera into my computer to work with its 640x480 pixels and its the same camera that made the recordings.  I assume this will affect my results somewhat, with the calibration and definitely with the angle per pixel measurement that I want.  I am working with OpenCV in C, I am wondering if theres a wayfunction to adjust the screen size for when I call up the camera to 704x576 and if I then do my measurements at this size can I get a somewhat accurate angle per pixel measurement  Or do I need to do something else p  pIm still figuring my way around camera geometry and openCV, and any help would be much appreciated, thanks.  p

Negative 1081 pIt seems that ProGuard optimization options are global. Have a look at this similar problem pleasep  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions26061795donotoptimizeaspecificclasspathwithproguardDo not optimize a specific class path with Proguardap  pIs that for sure There is no way to enable optimization for certain classes but disable for some others p  pPlease note that I am talking about strongoptimizationstrong options, strongnot obfuscationstrong options in ProGuard.p  pHere is my problemp  pMy product is a jar file that I distribute to my costumers. To make my Android Java code more secure, Im using a Java obfuscator that performs strongcontrolflow obfuscationstrong. That is, in addition to symbol obfuscation, it makes changes to branching, conditional, and iterative constructs to confuse the Java decompiler yet yield valid execution at runtime.  Some of my customers use ProGuard in their Apps. They enable pretty much all optimization options, and they wouldnt agree to reduce the optimization level they have because the sizes of their apps are already large. Now ProGuard tries to optimize the classes in my jar files, the ones with controlflow obfuscation. It gets confused and produces invalid optimizations.p  pIf indeed there is no way to configure ProGuard to skip optimizing certain classes, then I think ProGuard should either offer such an option or start performing controlflow obfuscation so that I can get rid of the other tool. It might be worth bringing that up to Eric Lafortune, the developer of ProGuard, and take his input on this.p

Negative 1081 pIm trying to implement an AVL tree just for the sake of learning. I managed to make the insertion, but Im stuck at the deletion. I have a problem deleting a leaf node the onechild case works just fine.

I created a stack for the history of actions. Pushed an action to the stack after every stroke, and popd after an undo. Then on my undo event I just redraw everything minus the last action.

This approach is way too slow.  img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comORDLq.gif altenter image description here The above demonstrates only three levels of undo, the more I draw the slower the undo is obviously has more actions to read from the stack and redraw.p  pTheres got to be a way to make this work by just taking a snapshot of the current canvas.

Negative 1081 pI have seen lots of similar questions and those answers are what has gotten me this far.p  pI have an application where all all object are created via DC, so they are all all drawn. I have had much experience with sizers and 99 of the time sizers ROCK but in this case DC is the best answer.  So I want to have a tooltip for each element that is drawn and in the case the screen is refreshed and the element is drawn in a different location the tooltip should also move.  My first attempt was with setting a wx.Rect for each drawn item, but I ran into a hang situation.  If i was on the the right track track I will attach a code sample but if I should be barking up another tree please let me know before I pull anymore of this hair out my headp

Negative 1081 pI have a web app that talks to a service layer via WCF. These need to be internal endpoints and should be .net TCP bindings.

Negative 1081 pI work on a .NET application that very loosely followed an ntier kind of architecture the business objects not logic and data access were split out.  We are now looking to get into unit testing probably using NUnit, and want to start to refactor the code into an MVP architecture.  Based on some previous work done by someone else, I just refactored a screen into what I hope is MVP.p  pI moved almost all of the logic out of the form code Form.vb and into the presenter FormPresenter.vb.  Basically, the form looks like thisp  precodePublic Property SomeField As String Implements IForm.SomeField Get     Return txtSomeField.Text End Get Setvalue As String     txtSomeField.Text  value End Set  Public Event ClickBtnSomeButton.. Implements IForm.ClickBtnSomeButton  Private Sub OnClickBtnSomeButton..     RaiseEvent ClickBtnSomeButton.. End Sub codepre  pThe presenter then contains all of the logic that used to be in the form.  For instance, a button click eventp  precodePublic Sub OnClickBtnEditOrderByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs     View.CursorType  Cursors.WaitCursor      Try         If Not enabledActions.ContainsEdit Order Then Return         If View.SelectedInquiryRow Is Nothing Then Return         ShowViewAct     Catch ex As Exception         HandleExceptionex, Me.ToString, OnClickbtnEditOrder, True, True     Finally         View.CursorType  Cursors.Default     End Try End Sub codepre  pThe form works, it seems to be a much better design, but I have no idea how to test this.  The only public methods are the event methods.  Anything I would want to test like perhaps the phone number formatting is just a private method, called only by the events.p  pSo, ultimately, my question is  Did I refactor incorrectly, or is there simply nothing worth testing herep

Negative 1081 pTLDR  Is there a C implementation of RANSAC or other robust correspondence algorithms that is freely usable with arbitrary 2D point setsp  pI know that many implementations exist that include or make use of correspondence algorithms such as RANSAC Random Sampling Consensus. They are often used in computer vision applications and found in libraries such as a hrefhttpopencv.org relnofollowOpenCVa, a hrefhttpwww.pointclouds.orgabout relnofollowPCLa, etc. The general algorithm is well known and various site a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma46662253294342listsa the different steps.p  pNow, all the advanced implementations done for OpenCV, PCL, etc. I have found are for specific types of problem with an underlying set of assumptions. In OpenCV, you want to find the homography matrix between a first image and a portion of a second image a hrefhttpdocs.opencv.orgdoctutorialsfeatures2dfeaturehomographyfeaturehomography.htmlfeaturehomography relnofollowthis examplea. In PCL, you are in the realm of 3D point clouds and you are to my knowledge only able to match specific, already defined shapes a hrefhttpwww.pointclouds.orgdocumentationtutorialsrandomsampleconsensus.phprandomsampleconsensus relnofollowa line, a sphere, etc.a.p  pWhat I simply want to do is to take an arbitrary 2D set of points which may contain some noise and find a correspondence in a bigger set of 2D points which contain some noise and other points too. It has to require no specific model training other than inputting the two sets of points. I am in the process of implementing it myself in C, butp  ul lipI am by no mean an experienced programmer and I need the whole thing to executed quite fast previous implementation done by myself of well known algorithms edge detection, Gaussian blurring, etc. have proven to be significantly slower 10x than proven implementation.pli lipSimply ripping off an already existing open source implementation such as OpenCVs have proven to be beyond my current capabilities too much dependencies and virtual implementationtemplate and else...pli ul  pSo, if anyone knows of a freely usable BSD like and proven C implementation that I have missed...p

Negative 1081 pI have two Jenkins jobs, C compile and T test, C triggers T, C is quick, T is slow.  C recreates data which is used by T, so if C runs while T is running, T might fail due to the necessary data being temporarily unavailable or incomplete.p  pSometimes, C gets triggered a lot via CMS, busy development.  The standard way would be to synchronize C and T via a lock, so that never both run at the same time but instead wait for the other to finish before starting.  This waiting does not really suit me as it delays the C jobs too much.p  pAn alternative might be to turn T to concurrent running, but in my case T requires too many resources to be able to run concurrently.p  pSo my approach now is to configure C so that it first emabortsem a running T job in case one is running and then starts its work eventually triggering T again in the end.  Several quickly performed C builds will then each start a T build which will all be aborted gray bubble.  Only the last T build will be completed and show a decent red or green or yellow bubble.  But that will be enough in my case and I accept the drawback that this way I cannot detect exactly which commit broke the build.p  pNow the question is  How can I make C abort a T build  Preferably in an elegant way.p  pI only found a way to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions21021905howtostopabuildinjenkinsviatherestapigenerally abort a job from the outside using Jenkinss REST interfacea, but that doesnt seem to be very elegant.  Is there a more elegant way, maybe using a Jenkinsinternal feature I dont know or maybe by using a suitable pluginp

Negative 1081 pQuite a mouthfull of a question but its a OO principle Ive struggling with. Lets say i have an ecommerce app and there is the concept of payment method, examples could be CreditCard, Paypal, Apple pay etc. The user has a choice of which payment method to select so i need to present them all in a list on the screen and depending on the selection this will be used to drive a UI, presenting different textimagesinteractions as well as will be serialised slightly differently into a Payment request over the wire. p  pHere is some codep  precodepublic class PaypalPayment  PaymentMethod       public string Token     public string String    public class CreditCardPayment  PaymentMethod       public Address Address     public CreditCard CreditCard    interface PaymentMethod      public class Booking      public PaymentMethod PaymentMethod generic object      or      public PaypalPayment PaypalPayment     public CreditCardPayment CreditCardPayment  codepre  pSo in my booking class i can either have a generic payment object referred to by the interface but i cant get to the underlying type without casting which sucks, as in reality them dont share any common properties domanwise. Alternatively i have multiple properties which feels bad in a different way. The user can only select one payment method so the others will have to null or some kind of null object, i would have to either query an enum or ask each payment method if it is null. Also my payment method select screen is a bit more cumbersome as i cant just iterate on a generic type i have to explicitly build up the list.p  pIn theory i could add some methods to the PaymentMethod interface, such as Serialise or some UI presentation methods which all the payment methods have in common but then i would have to implement them in my model object which i dont want to do in my model layer.p  pOverall i dont have a clean solution for this in your typical object orientated language. I wrote this in c but this could apply to any OO language.p

Negative 1081 pI have a nice caching system in linux that uses a ramdisk to cache both image files and the HTML output of various pages of my website. p  pMy website is rather large and the ramdisk space required to cache everything exceeds 15GB excluding image output and I only have 2GB available for the cache.p  pWriting to and reading from cache is relatively fast but the problem is trying to figure out how to strongquicklystrong find the stalemost files when I run out of space in order to make room for a new file. I believe using ls R and scanning the large output is a slow process. p  pMy only other option which is inefficient to me is to flush the entire cache frequently in order to never run out of ramdisk space.p  pMy cache allows my website to load many pages with a time to first byte TTFB of under 200ms which is what google likes, so I want to try to keep that 200ms as a maximum TTFB value when loading a file from cache, even if files are deleted as a result from lack of ramdisk space.p  pI thought of using direct access memory via pointers for cache, but because the output to cache is of various sizes, I would feel that option would waste memory space at best or use alot of cpu to find the next free memory location.p  pAnyone got an idea on how I can quickly seek and then remove the stalest file from my cachep

Negative 1081 pI want to have 1 topic with 10 partitions. I am using default configuration of Kafka. I create 1 topic with 10 paritions by that helper script and now I am about to produce messages to it.p  pThe thing is that it seems like there are only 5 partitions from which consumers fetches data.p  pLets describe it in more detail.p  pI know that common stuff that you need one consumer thread per partition. I want to be able to commit offsets per partition and this is possible only when I have 1 thread per consumer connector per partition I am using high level consumer.p  pSo I create 10 threads, in each thread I am calling Consumer.createJavaConsumerConnector where I am doing this p  precodetopicCountMap.putmytopic, 1 codepre  pand in the end I have 1 iterator which consumes messages from 1 partition.p  pWhen I do this 10 times, I have 10 consumers, consumer per thread per partition where I can commit offsets independently per partition because if I put different number from 1 in topic map, I would end up with more then 1 consumer thread for that topic so if I am about to commit offsets with created consumer instance, it would commit them for all threads which is not desired hence for multiple partitions which is not desired.p  pBut the thing is that when I use consumers, only 5 consumers are involved and it seems that other threads are idle but I do not know why.p  pThe first possible reason is that even I have 10 partitions, only 5 partitions have messages so other 5 consumers are idle, but I do not understand how it is possible that messages are not spread evenly accross all partitions when I am using producers. I am sending like 1M of messages so if it is said they are spread evenly, every paritition emhas toem have at least some message in it.p  p EDITp  pI managed to create 10 partitions in a topic but I have only 7 consumers. Thats just a miracle to me.p  pThe thing is that I am creating these consumer threads in a loop. So I start first thread submit to executor service, then another, then another and so on.p  pSo the scenario is that first consumer gets all 10 partitions, then 2nd connects so it is splits between these two to 5 and 5 or something similar, then other threads are connecting.p  pI understand this as a partition rebalancing among all consumers so it behave well in such sense that if more consumers are being created, partition balancing occurs between these consumers so every consumer should have some partitions to operate upon.p  pBut from the results I see that there is only 7 consumers and according to consumed messages it seems they are split like 3,2,1,1,1,1,1 partitionwise. Yes, these 7 consumers covered all 10 partitions, but why consumers with more then 1 partition do no split and give partitions to remaining 3 consumersp  pI am pretty much wondering what is happening with remaining 3 threads and why they do not grab partitions from consumers which have more then 1 partition assigned.p

I stated that I used it and saw only mono chunk with high memory The problem is there must be some kind of memory leak not memory spike because if I play the game long enough, my Galaxy Grand Duo will crash with black texture which is memory used too much. If I saw it in the profiler, it said ManagedHeap and Mono Domain only with large chunk of memory after play the game multiple times.p
