Positive 218 pFor one part of a code, I need to save both the name and the stats user ID, group ID, modification time, permissions, etc. of every file in a given directory into an array of selfdefined structs. The saving info into the array is fine, so for clarity, I left those things out. The problem Im having is with the predefined codestruct statcode in testing, it prints out the same exact modification date for every file in the directory, which is one problem, and the date is from 1969, which is another problem considering I clearly remember creating and modifying those files sometime last year.

Positive 218 pI would like to allow users to manage their own files on my web application using a file manager. The specific file manager does not matter, but what I need to know is how to give each user access to their own file directory within my server storage directory and only allow reading and writing within that folder.p  pIn the backend, each user already has that folder set up as I was allowing them to upload single images before, but everything was handled on the back end, and now I dont understand how to give the user the ability to actually access that directory properly in such a way that the file manager can view and edit the directory contents.p  pOnce again, the file structure already exists and the server side code performs actions within those directories, but now the question is how to expose those directories freely to the user after doing a check that it is their folder and they have the permissions to view  modify. Much appreciated.p  pFOR EXAMPLEp  pELFinder requires the following parametersp  precodefunction elFinderBrowser fieldname, url, type, win    tinymce.activeEditor.windowManager.open     file pathtofile,  use an absolute path     title elFinder 2.0,     width 900,     height 450,     resizable yes   ,      setUrl function url        win.document.getElementByIdfieldname.value  url           return false  codepre  pI cant just simply pass in to the file attribute codestoragesubdirimagescode because thats not publicly accessible. Also, if I pass in the url to the public directory, the file manager only seems to be able to view the directory web pages. It cant make changes probably because the public folder is read only.p

Positive 218 pIm trying to zip a directory called codetestdicomscode to a zip file named codetestdicoms.zipcode using the following codep  pcodeshutil.makearchivehomecodetestdicoms,zip,homecodetestdicomscodep  pThe problem is that when I unzip it, all of the files that were in codetestdicomscode are extracted to codehomecodecode instead of the folder codetestdicomscode and all of its contained files being extracted to codehomecodecode. So codetestdicomscode has a file called codefoo.txtcode and after I zip and unzip codefoo.txtcodes path is codehomecodefoo.txtcode as opposed to codehomecodetestdicomsfoo.txtcode. How do I fix this Also, some of the directories Im working with are very large. Will I need to add anything to my code to make it ZIP64 or is the function smart enough to do that automaticallyp
Positive 218 pIn a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3430372howtogetfullpathofcurrentfilesdirectoryinpythonthis posta, the top answer explains how to 1 obtain the directory of the script being run, and 2 obtain the path of the working directory.

Given the limitations of LinqToSQL as a complete data querying language, Im not inclined to agree that its advantages go much beyond this but Id like to know others opinion.p  pTo start, what do I mean by a mismatch between procedural code and SQL  If you have ever developed a database application then you have likely become familiar with and weary of the steps needed to interact with a database set up all the parameters, enter the SQL command, and then hand convert the expected results back to variables or instances used in code.p  pLinqToSql makes this much easier by the use of fluent interfaces, lambda expressions, extension methods, etc. The end result is that it is easy to push native C scalar types into the data retrieval call and easy to automatically generate native C class instances.  Take this example from the MS web sitep  precodevar q     from c in db.Customers    where c.City  London    select c foreach var cust in q    Console.WriteLineid  0, City  1,cust.CustomerID, cust.City codepre  pVery coolp  pemSo what is the problememp  pWell, as I pointed out in the article linked to at the top, there are a number of problems. The embiggestem showstopper for me was that anyone who is minimally competent in SQL will immediately hit roadblocks.  It isnt just that many of the constructs created as alternatives to SQL are unfamiliar or even clumsy Group By Were talking emUglyem in LinqToSql.  The bigger problem is that there are a number of common constructs that just arent natively supported e.g. DateDiff.  At best, you can sort of escape out of Linq and submit SQL code into the Linq call stream.p  pSo, isnt it better to simply embed SQL in C or VB in ways that  permit you to freely state your SQL but that also give you easy parameter embedding and automatic conversion to native classes  For example, if we implement just six functions in a single class, we can write something like this where qry is an instance of our query classp  precodevar ListOfEnrollees              qry.CommandSelect b.FirstName, b.LastName, b.ID From ClassEnroll a inner join Folder b on a.ClientID  b.ClientID               .Where a.ClassID, classID              .AND              .AppendDateDiffd, a.ClassDate, ClassDate  0 Order By LastName              .ParamValclassDate              .ReturnListltEnrollListMemberDatagt codepre  pThe emCommandem simply starts us off collecting the SQL statement, the emWhereem starts our SQL Where clause and enters the first parameter, emAppendem tacks on more SQL, emParamValem just enters a parameter value to match the SQL parameter found on the previous line, and emReturnListem does the magic needed to convert to a class.  Notice that this is just SQL joins are trivial, DateDiff or any other SQL construct is supported, etc. We can test it out in a SQL window and then just cut and paste into our code, breaking it up as appropriate to enter our parameters.  It couldnt be easier.p  pNow, the basic construct shown above seems outrageously simple to me and it can handle emANYem SQL construct using the knowledge of SQL I emalreadyem have.  I did have to use some reflection and some of the other cool new C 3 constructs to make the ReturnList and similar calls work but, overall, it was pretty straightforward. I also added a number of bells
Negative 218 pI have a parameterized query. Depending on parameter values optimal query plan varies significantly.

Negative 218 h2Old questionh2  pMy understanding is that C has in some sense codeHashSetcode and codesetcode types. I understand what codeHashSetcode is. But why codesetcode is a separate word Why not every set is codeHashSetltObjectgtcodep  h2New questionh2  pWhy does C has no generic codeSetcode type, similar to codeDictionarycode type From my point of view, I would like to have a set with standard lookupadditiondeletion performance. I wouldnt care much whether it is realized with hashes or something else. So why not make a set class that would actually be implemented as a codeHashSetcode in this version of C but perhaps somewhat different in a future versionp  pOr why not at least interface codeISetcodep  h1Answerh1  pLearned thanks to everyone who answered below codeICollectioncode implements a lot of what youd expect from codeISetcode. From my point of view, though, codeICollectioncode implements codeIEnumerablecode while sets dont have to be enumerable  example set of real numbers between 1 and 2 even more, sets can be generated dynamically. I agree this is a minor rant, as normal programmers rarely need uncountable sets.p  pOk, I think I get it. codeHashSetcode was absolutely meant to be called codeSetcode but the word codeSetcode is reserved in some sense. More specifically, creators of .NET architecture wanted to have a consistent set sic of classes for different languages. This means that every name of the standard class must not coincide with any keyword in the .NET languages. The word codeSetcode, however, is used in VB.NET which is actually caseinsensitive is it so unfortunately there is no room for maneuvre there.p  pMystery solved p  h1Epilogueh1  pThe new answer by Alex Y. links to the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarydd41208128VS.10029.aspxMSDN pagea which describes  the upcoming .NET 4.0 interface strongcodeISetcodestrong which behaves pretty much as I thought it should and is implemented by codeHashedSetcode.

Negative 218 pSo Im doing a Parser, where I favor flexibility over speed, and I want it to be easy to write grammars for, e.g. no tricky workaround rules fake rules to solve conflicts etc, like you have to do in yaccbison etc.p  pTheres a handcoded Lexer with a fixed set of tokens e.g. PLUS, DECIMAL, STRINGLIT, NAME, and so on right now there are three types of rulesp  ul liTokenRule matches a particular tokenli liSequenceRule matches an ordered list of rulesli liGroupRule matches any rule from a listli ul  pFor example, lets say we have the TokenRule varAccess, which matches token NAME roughly [AZaz][AZaz09], and the SequenceRule assignment, which matches [expression, TokenRulePLUS, expression].p  pExpression is a GroupRule matching either assignment or varAccess the actual ruleset Im testing with is a bit more complete, but thatll do for the examplep  pBut now lets say I want to parsep  precodevar1  var2 codepre  pAnd lets say the Parser begins with rule Expression the order in which they are defined shouldnt matter  priorities will be solved later. And lets say the GroupRule expression will first try assignment. Then since expression is the first rule to be matched in assignment, it will try to parse an expression again, and so on until the stack is filled up and the computer  as expected  simply gives up in a sparkly segfault.p  pSo what I did is  SequenceRules add themselves as leafs to their first rule, and become nonrot rules. Root rules are rules that the parser will first try. When one of those is applied and matches, it tries to subapply each of its leafs, one by one, until one matches. Then it tries the leafs of the matching leaf, and so on, until nothing matches anymore.p  pSo that it can parse expressions likep  precodevar1  var2  var3  var4 codepre  pJust right  Now the interesting stuff. This codep  precodevar1  var2  var3 codepre  pWont parse. What happens is, var1 get parsed varAccess, assign is subapplied, it looks for an expression, tries parenthesis, begins, looks for an expression after the , finds var2, and then chokes on the  because it was expecting a .p  pWhy doesnt it match the var2  var3  and yes, theres an add SequenceRule, before you ask. Because add isnt a root rule to avoid infinite recursion with the parseexpresssionbeginningwithexpressionetc. and that leafs arent tested in SequenceRules otherwise it would parse things likep  precodereader readLine println codepre  pasp  precodereader readLine println codepre  pe.g. 1  3 is the expression expected by add, the leaf of varAccess ap  pwhereas wed like it to be leftassociative, e.g. parsing asp  precodereader readLine println codepre  pSo anyway, now weve got this problem that we should be able to parse expression such as 1  2 within SequenceRules. What to do Add a special case that when SequenceRules begin with a TokenRule, then the GroupRules it contains are tested for leafs Would that even make sense outside that particular example Or should one be able to specify in each element of a SequenceRule if it should be tested for leafs or not Tell me what you think other than throw away the whole system  thatll probably happen in a few months anywayp  pP.S Please, pretty please, dont answer something like go read this 400pages book or you dont even deserve our time If you feel the need to  just refrain yourself and go bash on reddit.

Negative 218 pHELP PLEASE I have an application that needs as close to realtime processing as possible and I keep running into this unusual delay issue with both TCP and UDP. The delay occurs like clockwork and it is always the same length of time mostly 15 to 16 ms. It occurs when transmitting to any machine eve local and on any network we have two.p  pA quick run down of the problemp  pI am always using winsock in C, compiled in VS 2008 Pro, but I have written several programs to send and receive in various ways using both TCP and UDP. I always use an intermediate program running locally or remotely written in various languages MATLAB, C, C to forward the information from one program to the other. Both winsock programs run on the same machine so they display timestamps for Tx and Rx from the same clock. I keep seeing a pattern emerge where a burst of packets will get transmitted and then there is a delay of around 15 to 16 milliseconds before the next burst despite no delay being programmed in. Sometimes it may be 15 to 16 ms between each packet instead of a burst of packets. Other times rarely I will have a different length delay, such as  47 ms. I always seem to receive the packets back within a millisecond of them being transmitted though with the same pattern of delay being exhibited between the transmitted bursts.p  pI have a suspicion that winsock or the NIC is buffering packets before each transmit but I havent found any proof. I have a Gigabit connection to one network that gets various levels of traffic, but I also experience the same thing when running the intermediate program on a cluster that has a private network with no traffic from users at least and a 2 Gigabit connection. I will even experience this delay when running the intermediate program locally with the sending and receiving programs.p

Negative 218 pLately Ive been running into the same issue with my Spring MVC applications over and over again, and Im trying to come up with a long term solution.p  pThe problem is that in a standard Spring 3 controller, you add model objects, you specify the view name either inline or from some injected field and return.  The problem Ive run into is that if you have a request that returns a page with a person, and their pets you have something like not compilable, psuedop  precodeRequestMapping valuepersonOverview, methodGET  public String getPersonOverviewmodel      model.addpersonRepo.getPerson theName      model.addpetRepo.getPetsForPerson thePerson       return personOverviewViewName  codepre  pNow, in your view you will be able to render all of this information.  However, the issue arises when someone updates the pets for the person, and you just want to rerender the part of the page that shows the pets.p  pNot only do you need to rewrite the rendering logic in a JSP fragment or in JavaScript, but also you will need to duplicate the controller code for each portion of the getPersonOverview method.  If you were to break the controller methods up into smaller chunks, then you will not be able to render the full page, but will have to render each chunk with a separate request.p  pIn a normal ModelViewController pattern, the solution to this is that the view has access to the model, but in Spring MVC the model is in Java and lies behind the request layer, so you need to build request handlers for each model object.p  pI know this question may seem a bit abstract, but what Im looking for is patterns or principles that can be used to allow me to build full pages with many model objects, but also be able to update portions of the page with ajax without duplication.p

Negative 218 pI have been trying to find answers to this question, and Im currently baffled.p  pWe are using Eclipse for development and testing, and the Tomcat 7 server is started from within Eclipse.  As there are frequent changes to the code, it automatically restarts and reloads the Spring beans when changes are made to the source code.  From what I see, it rebuilds the whole WebContent area for the webapp.p  pSo, inside the app, I tried writing the output file images that are created into the tomcat location where it puts the wtbwebapps folder.   However, since this seems to be regenerated every time you restart the server, there is no persistence to these files, and since I store the location of the file in my database, Id like the file to be there when I restart the server over and over.p  pFrom my research, it seems that you can set up a docbase in the context for Tomcat  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4133568shareafolderintomcatStack Overflow questiona .  Then I saw this a hrefhttpwww.eclipse.orgforumsindex.phptmsgampth207615ampS58a4ea9aa25e8f34e2001acc24de28admsg664875 relnofollowEclipse threada and they say that the docbase attribute isnt supported in Eclipse.  p  pSo does anybody here have any idea where I can put these file where theyll still be available via the web  These images are basically the results of simulations that are run, and its kind of necessary to have them available.p  pThanks so much for any thoughts.  I dont have code examples here because it seems to be totally a configuration thing.  If there is any info that I can provide that would help, Id be happy to.p

The combobox is populated with all my employees, and when I make a selection, it is reflected in the datatable.  However, when the screen loads, the currently assigned employee is not selected by default in the combobox.  I thought that the SelectedValueBinding property of the combobox would handle this... what am I doing wrongp  pbrbUpdate for clarificationb brThe datagrid is bound to a datatable which includes an EmployeeID column.  Lets assume that when the screen loads, there are three rows in the table with EmployeeIDs 1, 2, and 3.  I need the combobox column in the first row to have EmployeeID 1 selected, the second row to have EmployeeID 2 selected, and the third row to have EmployeeID 3 selected.p

Negative 218 pI was modifying a WCF service to increase the timeout for a Silverlight client. Before modifying the timeouts Im seeing CommunicationObjectAborted exception The HTTP request to [URL] was aborted. At first I only modified the web.coffig of the WCF and it had no effect. I then followed this post a hrefhttpblog.ecofic.comp37 relnofollowhttpblog.ecofic.comp379a and edited ServiceReferences.ClientConfig as well. Now Im seeing a No endpoint exception. The exception was not thrown immediately after the client connects to WCF, but after about 1 minute after it connected to WCF.

Negative 218 pThe question might be slightly hard to understand, so Ill explain it more verboselyp  pSay I have a mobile site on a website and the root of the site is a hrefhttpwww.site.commobile relnofollowhttpwww.site.commobileap  pIf I load up this page without any hashes in the URL, then I get one div with datarolepage in the DOM. If I then click a link to another page, which might take me to the URL a hrefhttpwww.site.commobilemobilecontact.html relnofollowhttpwww.site.commobilemobilecontact.htmla, I get another datarolepage link for that page is inserted into the div. Thats all fine and correct.p  pHowever, if I then follow a link on this page back to the home page but not the back button and get the URL a hrefhttpwww.site.commobilemobile relnofollowhttpwww.site.commobilemobilea, then rather than jQuery Mobile reusing the same datarolepage div that was there when the page was first loaded, a new one is inserted into the DOM.p  pThis has the effect that any JavaScript bound to the pagecreate event that targets specific ids within the home page doesnt work as the ids are ambiguous.p  pOne thing I noticed when inspecting the generated HTML is that a datarolepage div loaded directly not through a hash Ajax load has a dataurl attribute that is equal to the id of that div, but when it is loaded through a hash, then dataurl is equal to the hash value.

Negative 218 pThis is less an HTML, CANVAS question and more of a general math question. I posted it here because its prototyped using CANVAS and is still kind of a general programming question that I thought someone could answer. Here is the basic idea I want to draw a line 10 pixels thick, but I dont want to use the standard lineTo and set a stroke width. I want to actually draw the border of the line using beginPath and lineTo. The reason being is this is actually for AS3 project and using this method allows us to have a line stroke and fill. So rotating the canvas and things of that nature are out of the question. I just need to figure out how to calculate the proper x, y coordinates for the line.p  pIn the code below is the coordinates for the top of a line. I basically want to take this coordinates, add 10 to the y axis for each one and that will give me the return coordinates for the bottom of the line. Of course, each segment of the line is rotated, so calculating the coordinates for the bottom of the line has proved tricky. Im hoping someone can help.p  pOnce you run the example code, the issue should be obvious. The line isnt drawn properly. For relatively mild rotations of line segments it seems to work, but as the angle of rotation gets more severe the x, y coordinates are calculated incorrectly.p  precodeltdoctype htmlgt lthtmlgt ltbodygt ltcanvas idcanvas width800 height600gt ltcanvasgt ltscript typetextjavascriptgt var coords  [     x78,y183,     x130,y183,     x237,y212,     x450,y213,     x517,y25,     x664,y212,     x716,y212 ]  var coordsBck  []  for i  0 i lt coords.length i       var c1, c2, r     c1  coords[i]      if i lt coords.length  1           c2  coords[i  1]         r  Math.atan2c2.y  c1.y,c2.x  c1.x         console.log c1.x, c1.y, c2.x, c2.y,  r  180Math.PI           else              r  00          var d  r  180Math.PI         var cos  Math.cos r      var sin  Math.sin r       var x  cos  0  sin  10     var y  sin  0  cos  10     coordsBck.pushx c1.x  x, y c1.y  y   whilecoordsBck.length gt 0       coords.push coordsBck.pop    var ctx  document.getElementByIdcanvas.getContext2d ctx.beginPath for i  0 i lt coords.length i       var line  coords[i]     console.log i, line.x, line.y      if i  0               ctx.moveTo line.x, line.y           else              ctx.lineTo line.x, line.y        ctx.fill  function to      return x   o.x  , y   o.y  ltscriptgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre

Negative 218 pHow can the theoretical peak performance of 4 floating point operations double precision per cycle be achieved on a modern x8664 Intel cpup  pAs far as I understand it take 3 cycles for an sse codeaddcode and 5 cycles for a codemulcode to complete on most of the modern Intel cpus see e.g. a hrefhttpagner.orgoptimizeinstructiontables.pdfAgner Fogs Instruction Tablesa . Due to pipelining one can get a throughput of 1 codeaddcode per cycle if the algorithm has at least 3 independent summations. Since that is true for packed codeaddpdcode as well as the scalar codeaddsdcode versions and sse registers can contain 2 codedoublecodes the throughput can be as much as 2 flops per cycle. Furthermore it seems although Ive not seen any proper doc on this codeaddcodes and codemulcodes can be executed in parallel giving a theoretical max throughput of 4 flops per cycle.p  pHowever, Ive not been able to replicate that performance with a simple cc programme. My best attempt resulted in about 2.7 flopscycle. If anyone can contribute a simple cc or assembler programme which demonstrates peak performance thatd be greatly appreciated.p  pMy attemptp  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt include ltmath.hgt include ltsystime.hgt  double stoptimevoid     struct timeval t    gettimeofdayampt,NULL    return double t.tvsec  t.tvusec1000000.0   double addmuldouble add, double mul, int ops     need to initialise differently otherwise compiler might optimise away    double sum10.1, sum20.1, sum30.2, sum40.2, sum50.0    double mul11.0, mul2 1.1, mul31.2, mul4 1.3, mul51.4    int loopsops10           we have 10 floating point ops inside the loop    double expected  5.0addloops  sum1sum2sum3sum4sum5                 powmul,loopsmul1mul2mul3mul4mul5     forint i0 iltloops i        mul1mul mul2mul mul3mul mul4mul mul5mul       sum1add sum2add sum3add sum4add sum5add        return  sum1sum2sum3sum4sum5mul1mul2mul3mul4mul5  expected   int mainint argc, char argv     ifargc2        printfusage s ltnumgtn, argv[0]       printfnumber of operations ltnumgt millionsn       exitEXITFAILURE        int natoiargv[1]1000000    ifnlt0 n1000     double xMPI    double y1.01e8    double tstoptime    xaddmulx,y,n    tstoptimet    printfaddmult .3f s, .3f Gflops, resfn,t,doublent1e9,x     return EXITSUCCESS  codepre  pCompiled withp  precodeg O2 marchnative addmul.cpp  .a.out 1000 codepre  pproduces the following output on an Intel Core i5750, 2.66 GHzp  precodeaddmul  0.270 s, 3.707 Gflops, res1.326463 codepre  pi.e. just about 1.4 flops per cycle.

Negative 218 pSo Im working on a software in VB.Net where I need to scrape information and process it according to rules.

Negative 218 pIm working on a Minecraftlike engine as a hobby project to see how far the concept of voxel terrains can be pushed on modern hardware and OpenGL  3. So, all my geometry consists of quads, or squares to be precise.p  pIve built a raycaster to estimate ambient occlusion, and use the technique of bent normals to do the lighting. So my normals arent perpendicular to the quad, nor do they have unit length rather, they point roughly towards the space where least occlusion is happening, and are shorter when the quad receives less light. The advantage of this technique is that it just requires a onetime calculation of the occlusion, and is essentially free at render time.p  pHowever, I run into trouble when I try to assign different normals to different vertices of the same quad in order to get smooth lighting. Because the quad is split up into triangles, and linear interpolation happens over each triangle, the result of the interpolation clearly shows the presence of the triangles as ugly diagonal artifactsp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comqL5AQ.png altDiagonal lines visible in the rendered resultp  pThe problem is that OpenGL uses barycentric interpolation over each triangle, which is a weighted sum over 3 out of the 4 corners. Ideally, Id like to use bilinear interpolation, where all 4 corners are being used in computing the result.p  pI can think of some workaroundsp  ol lipStuff the normals into a 2x2 RGB texture, and let the texture processor do the bilinear interpolation. This happens at the cost of a texture lookup in the fragment shader. Id also need to pack all these minitextures into larger ones for efficiency.pli lipUse vertex attributes to attach all 4 normals to each vertex. Also attach some [0..1] coefficients to each vertex, much like texture coordinates, and do the bilinear interpolation in the fragment shader. This happens at the cost of passing 4 normals to the shader instead of just 1.pli ol  pI think both these techniques can be made to work, but they strike me as kludges for something that should be much simpler. Maybe I could transform the normals somehow, so that OpenGLs interpolation would give a result that does not depend on the particular triangulation used.p  pNote that the problem is not specific to normals it is equally applicable to colours or any other value that needs to be smoothly interpolated across a quad.p  pAny ideas how else to approach this problem If not, which of the two techniques above would be bestp

Negative 218 pIm trying to implement a fancybox window that when open will then use JQZoom.p  pIm doing this within Wordpress although Im not using plugins, so dont know if that impacts anything, and my idea Option 1 was to load fancybox using an iframe, and then just create another page that implements JQZoom. I couldnt get this to work, but maybe thats because Im mostly a designer, but maybe Im doing it wrong...p  pAnother question on here httpstackoverflow.comquestions5994003addingzoomtofancybox seemed to imply calling JQZoom when fancybox is fired i.e., onComplete. I could sort of follow along with what the script was trying to do, but wasnt sure how to implement it.p  pSo Im wondering what the best way to approach this is.  Option 1, 2, or some other way I havent thought of  p  pFundamentally, I guess what Im asking is how to combine two JQuery features that are usually called independently, and how does a newbie implement the code to make it work p  pThanks very much for any advice you may have.p

Negative 218 pIm developing an universal application with two view controllers, a Master View Controller a UITableViewController and a Detail View Controller with a UIWebView. When the user selects an item each item is an object with a URL property in the table, the app sets the detailItem property in the DetailViewController. I customized the setDetailItem to detect when the detailItem is set and open the related URL in the DetailViewControllers web view.p  pThe user selects another item and the web view loads the other related URL.p  pIt works fine with items containing URLs targeting HTML files. When the URL targets a PDF file, the web view loads it normally but, when the user selects another item, the app crashes.p  pOn the iPhone simulator it crashes if the user returns to the MasterViewController by pressing the back button in the navigation bar. On the iPad simulator, Im using a UISplitViewController and it crashes when the user selects any other item in the MasterViewControllers table view.p  pEven setting Xcode to display all exceptions it doesnt show any output. Only crashes in the main.m.p  pCuriously, if I deploy the app on the device and use it, it works fine, but if I run on the device debugging from Xcode it also crashes.p  pAny idea on how to fix it or is it just a bug in the simulatorp
Negative 218 pIm used to building my source in an IDE and having good feedback in the environment. Currently however Im writing source code in notepad, ftping it to another machine with specific environment settings, and then building it there and reading the Makefile output to see that it all checks out. After that, I scp the built executable to the actual device to test it. p  pIm curious if there are environments that can simplify this. I suppose I could write a script that ftps changed files and then runs a command through ssh to build them. But Id like an environment that will parse the makefile output and give me an build report like in most IDEs. Im not sure how specific this problem is, or if a lot of embedded systems have similar set ups. p  pIdeally I suppose I would have a machine with the correct build environment, but that isnt the case p

Negative 218 pIm a newcomer to Qt, but Im trying to implement what basically amounts to a videogameesque input loop in a Qt application crazy, I know, but see if you can help.  I need accurate, onetoone event handling for key presses emandem key releases, for all keys, including modifiers, no matter how weirdly you chordup the keyboard.p  pOf course, your main access to key events is through codeQKeyEventcode.  But lets say the following happensp  ul liuser presses and holds kbdCtrlkbdli liuser presses and holds kbdUpkbdli liuser releases kbdCtrlkbd and kbdUpkbd simultaneouslyli ul  pAs far as I can tell, what I get from Qt isp  ul liQKeyEvent for the pressing of kbdCtrlkbd, by itself codeQtKeyCtrlcodeli liQKeyEvent for the pressing of kbdUpkbd, by itself codeQtKeyUpcodeli liQKeyEvent for the releasing of kbdCtrlUpkbd, with codekey  QtKeyUpcode and the Ctrl bit reflected in a modifier change.li ul  pThis may be not exactly accurate, but its my best guess as to whats going on from way too much debugging of the issue.  In any event, the key emreleaseem events when modifiers are involved are emincrediblyem unreliable.p  pThe CtrlUp sequence there at the end is the problem.  Now, I know Im getting modifier state in codeegtmodifierscode, and Im getting the key press in codeegtkeycode.  I could do some complicated hacks, trying to remember the modifier state internally, to detect when the users released the modifier.  But then, the Qt docs inform me, speaking of codeegtmodifierscode, thatp  blockquote   pThis function cannot always be trusted. The user can confuse it by pressing both Shift keys simultaneously and releasing one of them, for example.p blockquote  pThis is exactly the case Im trying to emavoid.emp  pIs there any reliable way to keep track of onetoone key presses and releases, for both normal and modifier keys, in Qt  If not, whats the closest you can getp  pstrongEDITstrong I can refine this a little bit.  It seems that if you hold down kbdCmdkbd on a Mac, press a few keys letter keys, say, release them, then release kbdCmdkbd, you emdont get release events for the letter key releases.em  Im going to try to isolate a small example and see if this is actually a Qt bug.p

Negative 218 pI have a window in Gnome whose titlebar I would like to remove.  This was easy in FVWM2 I just set the window style to include codeNoTitlecode.  In Gnome there does not appear to be a similar option.p  pI recently learned to use codewmctrlcode to modify EWMHcompliant window options, but it also has no method to remove the titlebar that I can see.p  pThere must be emsomeem way to do this, however, because applications like Audacious can tell Gnome not to display window decorations.p  pGoogling, I found some pages that discuss the issue of removing the titlebar with codewmctrlcode, but in each case the solution was simply to codefullscreencode the window, such that the titlebar moved off the screen altogether.  Thats not what Im looking forp  pThanks for any help.p

Negative 218 pThere is a JCheckBox called strongonestrong and another called strongtwostrong. There is also a JScrollPane called strongspstrong. In it is a JTextArea. The point of the checkboxes is to hide and show certain parts of the program. I simplified the program and here I tediously explain what is supposed to happen just to make sure you understand the program.p  pThis is supposed to happenp  pInitially only strongonestrong is visible and it is unselected. Whenever strongonestrong is selected, strongtwostrong should be set visible. Whenever strongtwostrong is selected, strongspstrong should be set visible. When a checkbox is unselected, the corresponding component is set invisible. However, when one is unselected, strongspstrong is also set invisible. strongonestrong controlls strongtwostrong and strongspstrong.p  pThe problemp  pWhen strongonestrong is selected, strongtwostrong is visible. But when strongtwostrong is selected, strongspstrong is not visible it should be. When one is unselected while strongtwostrong is selected, strongtwostrong is invisible this should happen. But when strongonestrong is selected, strongtwostrong is visible and all of a sudden strongspstrong is now visible. After this point, the program functions as it was intended.p  pThis however works with other JComponents in replace of the JScrollPane.p  pWhat could be wrongp  precodepackage tests  import java.awt. import java.awt.event. import javax.swing.  public class Checkboxscrollpane extends JPanel       private JCheckBox one, two     private JScrollPane sp      private Checkboxscrollpane          Listener listener  new Listener          one  new JCheckBox         one.addActionListenerlistener         addone          two  new JCheckBox         two.addActionListenerlistener         addtwo          sp  new JScrollPanenew JTextAreahello         addsp          one.setVisibletrue         two.setVisiblefalse         sp.setVisiblefalse           Override     public void paintComponentGraphics g          super.paintComponentg          one.setLocation50, 50         two.setLocation70, 70         sp.setLocation90, 90           private class Listener implements ActionListener           public void actionPerformedActionEvent e              if e.getSource  one                  two.setVisibleone.isSelected                          sp.setVisibleone.isSelected ampamp two.isSelected                    public static void mainString[] args          JFrame frame  new JFrame         frame.setSize300, 200         frame.addnew Checkboxscrollpane         frame.setDefaultCloseOperationJFrame.EXITONCLOSE         frame.setVisibletrue       codepre

Using menu from this dialog, I open another Dialog box which shows me macrogrid block information from the first dialog. So to show 2nd dialog box I am using function  DialogBoxhInst, MAKEINTRESOURCEIDDDIALOG1, NULL, DialogProc But this transfers the execution of the program to the new dialog box and I cant process further messages in the 1st dialog unless I close the new dialog box. p  pCan someone please tell me a way to solve this problem Is it the same thing as modal vs modeless dialogboxesp  pSomeone suggested me to use BackgroundWorker thread for this purpose. But when I tried to research about it, I read at many places that it doesnt work with win32 programming. Instead in some forums I read about using PostMessage function for the same purpose. Can someone help me deciding what would be the best approach to handle this problem I would really be grateful if someone could explain it in detail. p  pThanks a lot.p

Negative 218 pI am trying to create a map editor based on WPF. Currently Im using a hack to render DirectX contents. I created a WinFormsHost and rendered on a WinFormsPanel.p  pThis all because DirectX Im using DirectX 11 with Featurelevel 10 wants a Handle alias IntPtr where to render. I dont know how I can initialize and use the DX Device without a handle.p  pBut a WPF control has no handle. So I just found out, there is an interop class called D3DImage. But I dont understand how to use it.p  pMy current system works like thisp  pThe inner loop goes through a list of IGameloopElements. For each, it renders its content calling Draw. After that, it calls Present of the swap chain to show the changes. Then it resets the device to switch the handle to the next element mostly there is only one element.p  pNow, because D3DImage doesnt have a handle, how do I render onto it I just know I have to use Lock then SetBackBuffer, AddDirtyRect and then Unlock.p  pBut how do I render onto a DirectX11.Texture2D object without specifying a handle for the devicep  pIm really lost... I just found the DirectX 4 WPF sample on codeplex, but this implements all versions of DirectX, manages the device itself and has such a huge overhead. I want to stay at my current system. Im managing the device by myself. I dont want the WPF control to handle it.p  pThe loop just should call Render and then passes the backbuffer texture to the WPF control.p  pCould anyone tell me how to do this Im totally stuck ...p  pThanks a lot p  pRp

If I touch into either one and the custom keyboards codeonStartInputcode method is called the button is labeled correctly.  p  pBut when I touch into the first codeEditTextcode box and then Next to the second box the button stays as Next and not Done as it should be.p  pHow can I have the keyboard pull the codeEditorInfocode of the codeEditTextcode it is in to relabel the NextDone buttonp  pThanks Adamp

Negative 218 pI have a MasterDetails Application.brBy default, we have the MasterViewController attached to a TableViewController, in addition, i have attached it to an Sqlite database and all the data are showing correctly as they should. So i added a UISearchBar, in order to search upon all the items  br Search functionalitys were working fine but the only bug was, the search bar disappears when scrolling down.br So as a solution, i removed the TableViewController and created a simple UIVIewController and added a TableView , TableViewCell and a search bar in order to keep the search bar fix on top of the View as suggested by many people.brNow the difference between those two concepts is, the TableViewController First Case loads the whole data in the cells once the application loads, when the ViewController  Second Case , with a tableView , tableViewCell and a searchBar does not load anything at startup, It loads the different elements when the user start writing a word in the searchBar.

Negative 218 pUsing JUCE with TUIO, Im developing a multitouch utility to send hot keys commands to other applications I am using a usb touch frame that sends TUIO messages.  For instance, I provide an interface through which users can touchandhold to program a key combo and then tap that button to send the programmed key combo to another app.  They way I accomplish this on OSX is by running my utility as a background only application codeNSApplicationActivationPolicyProhibitedcode.  I use code[NSWindow setCanHide NO]code so the GUI of my utility is visible even though it runs as a background app.p  pIt works well except in the case that a window from another application is on top of mine.  What happens is that touches get passed through that other app into mine causing unintentional button pushes in my app.  Normally, I could have my app only listen to the TUIO touch callback whenever is is the active application, code[NSApp isActive]code.  But, since my app is background only, it is never active and I have no way to tell if another window is covering it to prevent touches.  p  pSo, is there any way for a background only app to be able to tell if it is on top of all other windows  Or, is there a way from within my app to get a list of all Cocoa windows from other applications and be able to tell if they are appearing on top of my background only app p  pAlso, does anyone know how I would go about all of the above in Windows  In other words, what is the Windows equivalent of codeNSApplicationActivationPolicyProhibitedcode and would I be able to tell if it is covered by other applications windowsp
Negative 218 pWe have 70 SQL Server 2008 databases that need to be copied from an OLTP environment to a separate reporting server. Once the DBs are copied, we will do some partial data transformation denormalization, row level security, etc. SSRS Reports will be written based on these static denormalized tables and views.p  pWe have a small nightly window for copying and transforming all 70 databases 3 hours. Currently databases average about 10GB.p  pstrongOptionsstrongp  pstrong1. Transactional replicationstrong We would need to create 100 static denormalized tables on each reporting database. Doing this for all 70 databases almost reaches our nightly time limit. As the databases grow we will exceed the time limit. We thought of mixing denormalized tables with views to speed up transformation. But then there would be some dynamic and some static data which is not a solution we can use. Also with 70 databases using transactional replication we are concerned about bandwidth usage.p  pstrong2. Snapshot replicationstrong Copy the entire database each night. This means we could have a mixture of denormalized tables and views so the data transformation process is quicker. But the snapshot is a full data copy, so as the DB grows, we will exceed our time limit for completing copy and transformation.p  pstrong3. Log shippingstrong In our nightly window, we could use the log shipping to update the reporting databases, then truncate and repopulate the denormalized tables and use some views. However, I understand that with log shipping, extra tables and views cannot be added to the subscribing database.p  pstrong4. Mirroringstrong  Mirroring is being deprecated, but also the DB is not active for reporting against until failover.p  pstrong5. SQL Server 2012 AlwaysOn.strong We dont have SQL Server 2012 yet, can this be configured to do an update once a day instead of realtime And can extra tables and views be created on the subscribing database our reporting databasesp  pstrong6. Merge replicationstrong This is meant to be for combining multiple data sources into one database. But is looks like it allows for a scheduled update once per day and only updates the subscriber DB with the latest changes rather than doing an entire snapshot. It requires adding a rowversion column to every table but we could handle this. Also with this solution would additional tables be able to be created on the subscriber database without the update getting out of syncp  ol liThe final option is that we use SSIS to select only the data we need from the OLTP databases. I think this options creates more risk as we would have to handle insertsupdatesdeletes to our denormalized tables, rather than just drop and recreate the denormalized tables daily.li ol  pAny help on our options would be greatly appreciated. If Ive made any incorrect assumptions, please say. p

Negative 218 pThis has been asked on here before, but it was never resolved, so I decided so see if anyone has figured out how to do this in the past yearp  pBy default, iPhones and Androids will automatically zoom the page to attempt to make it fit nicely in the frame if no viewport meta tag exists. Web sites designed for desktops will be zoomed out so they fit inside the small viewport, but obviously the pixels arent really represented truthfully.p  pSo, how do I display a full size web page on a mobile browser so that 300px is actually represented with 300 real pixels on the mobile devices screenp  pI know about the meta viewport method, but from what Ive been able to tell so far, the pixel ratio used in such cases is 1.5 or 1.0 when the zoom is set to 100 and the width is set to the devicewidth, and you can detect at what pixel ratio the mobile device is rendering. I dont seem to be able to find some way to explicitly force devices to use only the 1.0 pixel ratio and never the 1.5 pixel ratio.p  pHow do I for a device to use a pixel ratio of 1.0 so that 300 pixels as defined in the CSS actually render across 300 pixels on the mobile devices screen How do I display a web page at its actual truthful size, not with a pixel ratio of 1.5p  pHeres an example of what I DONT want Currently, if you use the meta tag to set the viewport properties of a mobile browser like thisp  precodeltmeta nameviewport contentwidthdevicedisplay, initialscale1.0 gt codepre  pthen that means that the mobile browser will render the page almost exactly like as the page was designed, except that each pixel defined in the CSS actually encompasses 1.5 pixels on the devices screen, thus a pixel ratio of 1.5.

Negative 218 pI am trying to automate printing of intranet websites. Since this is an application that will be put on a specific users computer, which will be run on an asneeded basis, Id like it to be as undisruptive as possible in other words, not launching IE for each page. The catch is that I need to print the first page of the website and then print the whole website again, which will produce the first page two times. What is the best way to do thisp  pI have no problem getting it to loop through the pages that it needs to print, nor do I have a problem opening the page with webbrowser. I do, however, have a problem specifying a print range. p  pI also tried PrintDocument, but couldnt figure out how to get that to open within the form.p  pThanks for any help that can be provided.p

Negative 218 pNow, this is an extremely odd behavior.p  pTLDR  in a rendertotexture setup, upon resizing the window framebuffer 0 only the very next call to strongglClearGLCOLORBUFFERBITstrong for bound framebuffer 0 the windows client area gives strongGLOUTOFMEMORYstrong, only on one of two GPUs, however rendering still proceeds properly and correctly.p  pNow, all the gritty detailsp  pSo this is on a Vaio Z with two GPUs that can be switchedto with a physical toggle button on the machinep  ol lipOpenGL 4.2.0  NVIDIA Corporation GeForce GT 640M LEPCIeSSE2 GLSL 4.20 NVIDIA via Cg compilerpli lipOpenGL 4.0.0  Build 9.17.10.2867  Intel IntelR HD Graphics 4000 GLSL 4.00  Build 9.17.10.2867pli ol  pMy program is in Go 1.0.3 64bit under Win 7 64bit using GLFW 64bit.p  pI have a fairly simple and straightforward rendertotexture mini pipeline. First, normal 3D geometry is rendered with the simplest of shaders no lighting, nothing, just textured triangle meshes which are just a number of cubes and planes to a framebuffer that has both a depthstencil renderbuffer as depthstencil attachment and a texture2D as color attachment. For the texture all filtering is disabled as are mipmaps.p  pThen I render a fullscreen quad a single oversized fullscreen tri actually just sampling from said framebuffer texture color attachment with texelFetchtex, glFragCoord.xy, 0 so no wrapping is used.p  pBoth GPUs render this just fine, both when I force a core profile and when I dont. No GL errors are ever reported for this, all renders as expected too. Except when I resize the window while using the Intel HD 4000 GPUs GL 4.0 renderer both in Core profile and Comp profile. Only in that case, a single resize will record a GLOUTOFMEMORY error directly after the very next glClearGLCOLORBUFFERBIT call on framebuffer 0 the screen, but only once after the resize, not in every subsequent loop iteration.p  pstrongInterestingly, I dont even actually do any allocations on resizestrong I have temporarily disabled ALL logic occuring on window resize  that is, right now I simply fully emignoreem the windowresize event, meaning the RTT framebuffer and its depth and color attachment resolutions are not even changedrecreated. Meaning the next glViewPort will still use the same dimensions as when the window and GL context was first created, but anyhoo the error occurs on glClear not before, only after, only once  Ive double and triplechecked.p  pWould this be a driver bug, or is there anything I could be doing wrongly herep

Negative 218 pIm optimising a particular use case of my Django app. My first step was to replace a codeQuerySetcode with a codeValuesQuerySetcode. This worked quite well but I want to do more. Now Im considering using Memcache the app is running on Google App Engine. So my plan is to basically put the codeValuesQuerySetcode in Memcache. However it is my understanding that codeValueQuerySetcode is basically a not yet materialised data structure. In order for the cache to work, the codeValueQuerySetcode needs to materialise first and then put in the Memcache.p  pAccording to the a hrefhttpsdocs.djangoproject.comendevrefmodelsquerysets relnofollowDjango docsap  precodelist. Force evaluation of a QuerySet by calling list on it. codepre  pandp  precodeFinally, note a ValuesQuerySet is a subclass of QuerySet, so it has all methods of QuerySet. codepre  pBut when I try codemyvaluesqs.listcode it throws an exceptionp  precodeAttributeError ValuesQuerySet object has no attribute list codepre  pSo, although codeValuesQuerySetcode is a subclass of codeQuerySetcode it apparently cannot codelistcode its contents. Which, if true, would mean that the Django docs are wrong or at least misleading.p  pAm I missing something or are the docs indeed wrong What would be the best way to materialise the result of codeValueQuerySetcode so that I can store it in Memcachep

Negative 218 pI am creating an MVPlike application in GWT.p  ul liThere are multiple panels, and each one is visible at all times. li liEach panel has a Presenter, and there is a single AppController which sits above all Presenters.li liThere are some applicationlevel events which arise within one Presenter but have implications for other Presenters.li liThe suggested architecture for this seems to involve an Event Bus. However, Im not sure I see the advantage over something simpler.li liIn particular, wouldnt it be cleaner to simply allow the AppController and only the AppController to subscribe to events from any Presenter The AppController can then tell each Presenter what to do, given the event.li liThe Event Bus seems like a quasiglobal variable. But if you can accomplish the same thing with more precisely defined methods i.e. the methods which AppController calls on each Presenter isnt that preferable li ul  pTo put my concern more precisely why introduce an Event Bus at all, rather than simply letting events bubble up to the appropriate decisionmaking level To me this seems like the most straightforward extension of the MVP concept, and it doesnt require the new idea of an Event Bus. I dont understand what problem the Event Bus was introduced to solve.p

I downloaded the stuff with the download as zip button on github, worked on the project, but now when in neatbeans i do right clickremotepush, i enter repo informations, then it asks me to choose a local branch which i dont have because I downloaded manually the files.p  pSo I created a local branch with the same name of the only branch of the project I can see on github, but when I do push, nothing changes on the repo.

Negative 218 pI am developing a WP8 application with C in which I have several sockets from Windows.Networking.Sockets.StreamSocket class. I want to read data from the sockets without firing  separate threads for performing blocking read on each of the sockets. However, Socket.Select method is not part of supported APIs in WP8. So, is there any other ways to mimic the action of Socket.Select with the APIs provided by WP8 or the sole option is to start separate threads for each socketp

Negative 218 pI have a .NET library that internally has a dependency on Castle.Core.dll, since I use a hrefhttpwww.castleproject.orgprojectsdynamicproxy relnofollowCastles DynamicProxya specifically, an interface proxy without target to perform interception of method calls for custom processing. Because my assembly is stronglynamed, I want to use a hrefhttpwww.microsoft.comenusdownloaddetails.aspxid17630 relnofollowILMergea to combine all of my dependencies into a single assembly for deployment, internalizing the types of my dependencies so as to not expose them unnecessarily to my consumers. This is particularly important for the a hrefhttpnuget.org relnofollowNuGeta case, where if my assembly is stronglynamed, I have to set my package dependencies to the emspecificem version of the dependency, or the assembly name resolution breaks, because Castle.Core.dll is also stronglynamed. Note that releasing my project as a stronglynamed assembly is a feature valued by my users, so removing the strongname is not an option.p  pApparently, DynamicProxy requires some of its classes to be public to work properly. No problem, I can exclude certain types from being internalized by ILMerge. However, my problems occur when I have a user who references my library, but also references Castle.Core.dll. The public types are now provided by two assemblies, and references to them are ambiguous.p  pIf I dont internalize Castle.Core.dll using ILMerge, shipping it alongside my own assembly, this risks version conflicts between my version and my users versions. If I use ILMerge to internalize the assembly, Im forced to exclude internalizing the types that DynamicProxy requires to work properly. This approach will break any project that references both my assembly and Castle.Core.dll because of the ambiguous types.p  pAm I forced into one of these two suboptimal courses of action Or is there some solution Ive not yet thought ofp

Negative 218 pTheres some good reasons to avoid the eval function in JavaScript, namely security risks when including user input in the eval code. However, in a situation where the eval code does not include anything affected by user input in my particular situation, we have dynamic templates defined in XML files  these templates can also specify complex validation functions, javascript code that is embedded in the XML, which is then received by the client via AJAX, is there any reason to avoid the eval functionp  pI came up Im probably not the first, but I havent seen this done with a solution using a dynamically created inline  tag instead of evalp  precodescriptObject.textstrJSCode codepre  pA simple example can be seen at stronga hrefhttpjsfiddle.netH7EG91 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netH7EG91astrong I know this example strongdoesstrong use user input, but thats just to make it easy to demonstrate.p  pIs there any reason to do this instead of eval The outcome is basically the same, although this option might appear less scary to the diehard foes of eval.p

Negative 218 pI would like to change the behavior of a JSpinner so that when you click on the text, it selects it. This makes it easier to replace the field with the value that you want. Unfortunately, I cant get the behavior to work and instead, it just inserts the cursor in the text without selecting what is already there.p  pI have tried adding a focus Listener to both the JSpinner itself and the text area itself, via codeDefaultEditor this.getEditor.getTextFieldcode, yet neither of these seem to have the intended effect. My code for the JSpinner itself is as followsp  precodespinner.addFocusListenernew FocusAdapter             Override             public void focusGainedFocusEvent e                  DefaultEditor JSpinner e.getSource.getEditor.getTextField.selectAll                        codepre  pIm not sure what the problem is. If it matters, Im running Mac OS 10.7.5 and Java 6u43.p  pEDIT I put a codeSystem.out.printlncode right at the beginning of the focusGained method and discovered that it was never called. So it looks like getting focus on the JSpinner isnt registering. Again, I tried putting the focusAdpater both on the spinner and on the text field not at the same time though.p

Negative 218 pWe need help figuring out the code to generate to do the followingp  ol liThe website has on its homepage a jquery slider with a Youtube video on the first slide. But the video wont autoplay, we want it to be played only when the Fancybox popup close is triggered.li liA Fancybox v2x will be displayed automatically on the same page at first. This Fancybox will have an image linking to an external URLli liIf we close the Fancybox window, we would like the Youtube video from the jquery slider to play automatically.li ol  pWe havent generated the code yet, but because usually its the other way around having the video play on the Fancybox rather than having Fancybox trigger a Youtube autoplay from another div, this becomes complicated.p  pYour help would be really appreciated.p  pThanksp

Negative 218 pI read the reason for defining static data members in the source file is because if they were in the header file and multiple source files included the header file the definitions would get output multiple times.

Negative 218 pWe are writing a layer that allows us to trigger a build under TFS from another application. p  pThe intention is that a Microsoft Dynamics CRM site can trigger the build. So as to make this simpler we have written a very simple web based service that allows the Dynamics site to start the build, get an identifier back, and then poll for the status and results.p  pThe triggering of the build does the followingp  precodeIBuildRequest buildRequest  buildDefinition.CreateBuildRequest IQueuedBuild queuedBuild  buildServer.QueueBuildbuildRequest codepre  pThen we return the identifier of the queuedBuild Id to the client. It can then poll the service with this identifier to see if the build is still running or has finished. The problem is that while the queuedBuild does give us access to the actual build via the Build property, this is only filled once the build reaches the head of the queue and is started. Until then, this property return null otherwise we would have used the builds identifier.p  pOK so I figured Id just keep querying the queue for the queued build. Well that works until the build finishes and then the queued build is removed from the queue so now we can no longer get the build information.p  pWhat I am after is a way to statelessly query TFS to see if a build that was triggered is still in the queue, being built, or has finished. Is there any way to do thisp

Negative 218 pCant find an answer by Googling. So I come here.p  pI had an idea a week ago, about some potential vulnerabilities, and want to ask if it is possible and if there are any suggestions on how to fix them.p  pThe idea was simple if some part of my site or many parts of it write data to the DOM and then call the data back from it, would it be possible for someone to hack the server by editing the DOM within the browserp  pExample Suppose I have several radio buttons. Each button has its own logic associated with it. If I remove one of the buttons, but fail to remove or comment out the logic, could someone go in and edit the DOM name of one of the buttons to the removed one and upon submission have the server execute the logic associated with the removed radio buttonp  pI understand how to fix that situation, by removing or commenting out the removed buttons logic, but I fear my site relies a little too heavily on such things that could be manipulated via the DOM and Im just wondering...p  ol liIf such a thing is possible,li liIs some complex validation method the only way to prevent hacks of this natureli ol

Negative 218 pSo, Im writing or have written a contour mapping application for mapping power frequency in North America, and it works really well... On linux. I run it on a loop to update a bmp map file, which Im eventually going to output on a website. It can run and update itself in about 3 seconds, which is great for me. The problem came when I tried to port the application to windows. I moved the code into Visual Studios 2012. Linked the libraries, compiled and such, I had to make it ignore a few warnings about float to integer conversion, but I got it working.p  pThen, I had it run, and it didnt seem to do anything. But, after adding a few output commands, I realized it strongwasstrong doing something, it was just doing it probably 100x slower than the Linux executable I mean, admittedly, the code is pretty intensive around 400,000 iterations, but this is just ridiculous.p  pI saw a lot of other topics about VS running slow in debug mode, but even after I compile and run an executable, its still just as slow.p  pHeres relevant code, let me know if you have any ideas. Some of the functions you wont recognize because either they arent relevant to performance I only call them once, and I know they arent the source of the speed problem or they come from the Easy BMP library Im using for image manipulation.

Negative 218 pI have 2 entities in a onetoone association.  The first, codePersoncode, is stored in a MySQL database and handled by Doctrine. The second, codeAdUserRecordcode, describes an ActiveDirectory user record. It is readonly. It does not need to know about codePersoncode. Also,  codeAdUserRecordcode properties should never  be stored in the MySQL db for privacy reasons.p  pAn codeAdUserRecordcode is retrieved using a service, codeAdSearchercode, which can search by codesamaccountnamecode or codeobjectGUIDcode. Whenever a search is successful, the service checks to see if there is a corresponding codePersoncode record and creates one if there is not.  That works fine.p  pMy problem occurs when I start with a codePersoncode object. Mostly, I dont need to access a codePersoncodes codeAdUserRecordcode so Id prefer not to query Active Directory unless its required.

Negative 218 pSo Im working on a web app using kickstrap, though this is, at base, a bootstrap question.p  pI need completely different layouts i.e. html structures per media queriesscreen sizes. Meaning specific html elements move to totally different locations on the screen when viewed on tablets and phones and thusly becoming different spans widths and such.p  pThis is working up to a point, but Im not sure Im going about it the right way.p  pRight now I have my html for desktop and I use the bootstrap responsiveutilities to hide and show. example My primary desktop view is visibledesktop hiddentablet hiddenphonep  pI then have the same block of html modified as needed for the change in the layout for the 979px  768px media query and using hiddendesktop visible tablet hiddenphone.p  pI figure this is the easiest way to keep track of the various layouts and make changes when necessary later. The problem, however, is when I get to the phone layouts. I need a unique one for phone landscape and a unique one for phone portrait. Using the hiddenvisiblephone doesnt allow me to distinguish between the two.p  pSo I guess my first question is... Is this a good way to approach my needs or am I totally on the wrong track If Im wrong in my idea, what should I be doingp
Negative 218 pI have a fairly large solution with multiple subprojects mostly C with 1 or 2 C projects, each in its own folder.

However, there arent any unavailable projects in Solution Explorer. All the subprojects are there, and I dont see any warning or errors or missing references or anything.

Sugestions are welcomep  pstrongUPDATE 2strong The entity string name can be retrieved using reflection  p  precodestring s  globalSystem.Data.Services.Common.EntitySetAttributetypeofProduct.GetCustomAttributestypeofglobalSystem.Data.Services.Common.EntitySetAttribute, true[0].EntitySet codepre  pIf there is another more recomnended way to do it, please share.p  pIm still looking for a way to dinamically provide the condition to retrieve the entities from the service.p
Negative 218 pUsing Access 2007 SP3, I have a report.  When printed to a printer, and in the print preview, the report looks fine.  Well within margins, proper output, no extra pages...everything is fine.p  pWhen outputting this same report to a PDF, the report appears zoomed, and the content is clipped.  No extra pages are printed as if Ive gone beyond the margins.  Here is the code Im usingp  precodeDoCmd.OpenReport rptName, acViewPreview DoCmd.OutputTo acOutputReport, , acFormatPDF, PDFFileName, False DoCmd.Close acReport, rptName codepre  pThe report is opened in preview mode first so the page events fire to showhide objects based on fields in the recordset that feeds the report.p  pIve tried both screen quality and print quality parameters in the OutputTo call, with the same results.  Also, even if I call OutputTo all on one line and the events dont fire, the report is still zoomedclipped, it just has all the extra objects not hidden.p  pIve tried this on two different machines, one running Windows 7 and one running Windows Server 2008.p  pEven when setting a break point on the OutputTo line, the preview looks just fine...its the resulting PDF file that doesnt look right.p

I know I could use the synchronous version, but that rather defeats the point.p  pIm still fairly new to node.js, so please forgive me if this is a silly question, or its been answered before I did search.p  pTips or links gratefully received.p  pThanks.p
Negative 218 pI have a form in Joomla which has a drop down menu with a number of items to select. The problem is that if the form is saved and someone chooses not to choose one of the items not mandatory, then the first item in the list on this menu is selected by default.

Negative 218 pSo, I am just a beginner and I already went trough android documentations about supporting different screen sizes and I understand most of it. For my app, I created different layouts for each screen sizes and on the emulator it looks good.p  pJust one question.p  pHow should I export images to my drawable hdpi.lpdi,...mdpi...folders  Because, What I did was, I used art text2, and created a project with 700x700. Well. I set it to transperant, so its not excatly 700x700px. cause the image does not fill the entire space.p  pSo, before I hit export, should I change the PX Resolution for example for 450x450 or something for mdpi But, I didnt do that, and I amnot sure if I should have done that. then i hit export and it asks me where i want it to save the image. It also gives the me option to the change the DPI Resolution in DPI, i changed to 160 and saved that in my drawablemdpi folder. But I did not change PIXEL resoultion.p  pSo, was it correnct or should I have changed the pixel resoultion before, I export the actual imagep  pIn Eclipse, However, I change the width and height of the image in dp not px. so it doesnt take the entire screen space.p  pI checked my app  on different screen  sizes in Eclipse and it looks awesome. But, in the emulator, it looks cool. HOWEVER, if open my hdpi emulator the image does not look very sharp or clear. Whats the problem p  pThe image itself looks clear and sharp if open it with my image viewer on my computer even, the image viewer window is almost taking the entire screen of my laptop 14,1280800.p

Negative 218 pI am trying to find out if it is possible to display mobile native range picker or at least single number selection.p  pWhat I am trying to achieve is to have input field in which when you tap it opens up this special input that is on mobiles now, where you basically have numbers from xy and you can scroll up and down through them and select your desired number.p  pI tried using input type number but that only brings up keyboard in numeric state. p  pThe only way I can think of is having those inputs as select boxes, but I need to use this for price range selection which is usually from 100 to 35,000.

Negative 218 pWhen a Windows program terminates it calls event handlers like OnClose, OnDestroy and the destructor Destroy. When I want to save some INI settings these are the places to be. I wrote event handlers for all these events but they are not processed when I terminate the program.p  pDoes anyone know where I should place the code to be executed when an Android program terminates I strongly suspect that this applies to iOS as well. p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pJohans answer works for Android as well, although reality is slightly more complicated than his examples. The nice thing was that it forced me into TApplicationEvents, something Id never heard of. As is custom not documented by Embarcadero but the code of FMX.Platform is interesting enough. Several ApplicationEvents are defined of which three seem of interest aeEnteredBackground, aeWillBecomeInactive and aeWillTerminate. As they are not documented I presumed that they did what their names suggested signalling that a background state has been reached, that it wil start to go to background and that it wil very soon terminate. I adapted Johans code as followsp  precode  function TForm2.AppEvent AAppEvent TApplicationEvent AContext TObject  Boolean   begin    do something here for when the app is sent to background      case AAppEvent of      1   TApplicationEvent.aeEnteredBackground   Something for OnDeactivated                                                      which does not exist      2   TApplicationEvent.aeWillBecomeInactive if Assigned OnDeactivate                                                       then OnDeactivate Self      3   TApplicationEvent.aeWillTerminate      if Assigned OnClose                                                       then OnClose Self      end  case      Result  True  let iOSAndroid know it worked...   end  AppEvent  codepre  pWhen I label the events 1, 2 and 3 experiments with the debugger showed the following forcing the application to the background generates a sequences of events 2, 1, 1, 2. Once I even got 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2. If your code should be executed once, then take your precautions. But Better is the aeWillTerminate does what it advertizes it sends a signal when the application is terminated. Time to do so is likely to be brief and I will test whether it suffices to write a TIniFile.p  pI tried this code in Win32 as well and that does not work. The AppEvent is not fired. That forces me to test the code immediately on my tablet which takes some time. Pity.p

Negative 218 pWe have a control called SelectorSwitchedControl which uses a codeSelectorcode to switch between child controls.  Think along the lines of a simplified Tab control but which uses a codeComboBoxcode or codeListBoxcode instead of tabs.p  pWere trying to build a trigger that says if there is more than one item in the list, we need to show the selector.p  pThe only thing I can think of is to use two triggers, not one.  You make the selector visible by default in the controls template, then create two separate triggers to hide the selector the firsts condition testing for zero items, the seconds testing for 1 item.  If either of those match, the selector will hide. If none doi.e. there is two or more itemsthen it will remain visibile.p  pIt works, but again, Im wondering if theres any way to create this behavior using a single trigger, even if its a MultiTrigger.  But a MultiTrigger is an And test whereas wed need an Or test. Normally you could invert the logic to change a MultiTrigger to behave like an Or but that would require the properties to be booleans themselves as theres no such thing as Not conditions for the individual tests i.e. you cant say property not equal to 0 and not equal to 1.p  pFor the record, I know I could easily use converters andor codebehind as a way to address this, but Im wondering if theres a purelyXAML way to do this so this behavior could be a styled with no other code dependencies.p

Negative 218 pI have a thirdparty jar that is a dependency of my project.  Because of business constraints, I do not have access to an enterprise or company repository, which would definitely be my preference for this issue.  But regardless, this thirdparty jar is not available publicly, and so it is included in the web project under codesrcmainresourcescode.  p  pThis is a Maven project, and so I list this thirdparty jar as a compile time dependency, and include in my pom a build plugin that will install the thirdparty jar to my local repository as part of the build process I tell Maven to perform this goal during the codevalidatecode phase of the build lifecycle, which to my knowledge would be before any other Maven phase.  p  pHowever, when I run a codeclean installcode and have my local repository cleared out, the build fails due to the thirdparty jar not being resolvable locally or in the Maven central repository.  As far as I know, I have set up the pom correctly and I should be seeing Maven attempt to install the thirdparty jar locally before it begins dependency resolution.p  pThe issue is that if the dependency is listed before the jar has ever been installed locally, the build will fail due to being unable to resolve that dependency.  If I remove the thirdparty jar declaration and run the build, emafterem dependency resolution occurs which is the very first thing it does after the clean, but before any other phase, it will locally install the jar and things are fine.  But to my knowledge, it should run the codevalidatecode phase before it collects and resolves dependencies, and so the jar emshouldem be locally installed before its resolved by Maven.

Negative 218 pI have a part which is a simple list view, which Im using as a log view. In the codePostConstructcode method it registers for events to be logged. By default the part is stacked behind another part. Ive found that the codePostConstructcode method is not called until the view is first shown to the user. This means that log events are not logged unless the user has first clicked on the part. This doesnt work for me, as I want the part to contain the full log history, even if the user has never clicked on it.p  pHave I missed something basic Is there any way that I can coax e4 to construct the part right from the start I guess a better way to handle this would be to keep the log event data separately and only viewed through the part. Is there any way to avoid thatp  pMany thanks in advance.p

Negative 218 pHeres the scenario Ive some info to show on a ListView. Every row can have, title, body, date, avatar, and more data. And a ImageView that comes from network.

Negative 218 pSorry, this is the best title I can come up with.p  pI am hoping someone on here can give me an explanation to this behavior. My employer just decided to upgrade CF 8 to CF 10 yeah, I know. However, some of the servers are on CF 10 and some are on CF 8. I know it is not supposed to be like this but this is not within my control. Anyway, I have the following codes. It breaks in CF 8 but works in CF 10 without errors. In CF 8, it is saying that element a is not defined in local, which is expected and I dont have a problem with that.  After all, local is declared twice and a is not defined in the second one.p  pBut in CF 10, no errors generated and local.a is returned by the function. To me, CF 10 should throw an error either because the same reason why CF 8 fails or because local is a reserved word in CF 10 local was introduced in CF 9.  Why is it that CF 10 does not throw any errorsp  precodeltcfcomponent namemyComponentgt ltcffunction namemyFunction returntypeNumericgt ltcfscriptgt var local  StructNew local.a  1 ltcfscriptgt  ltcfset local  StructNewgt  ltcfif local.a is 0gt lt do something gt ltcfifgt  ltcfreturn local.agt ltcffunctiongt ltcfcomponentgt codepre

Heres how Ive set up my audio sessionp  precodedefine kInputBus 1 define kOutputBus 0 NSError err  nil NSTimeInterval ioBufferDuration  46 AVAudioSession session  [AVAudioSession sharedInstance] [session setCategoryAVAudioSessionCategoryPlayback withOptionsAVAudioSessionCategoryOptionMixWithOthers erroramperr] [session setPreferredIOBufferDurationioBufferDuration erroramperr] [session setActiveYES erroramperr] AudioComponentDescription defaultOutputDescription defaultOutputDescription.componentType  kAudioUnitTypeOutput defaultOutputDescription.componentSubType  kAudioUnitSubTypeRemoteIO defaultOutputDescription.componentManufacturer  kAudioUnitManufacturerApple defaultOutputDescription.componentFlags  0 defaultOutputDescription.componentFlagsMask  0  AudioComponent defaultOutput  AudioComponentFindNextNULL, ampdefaultOutputDescription NSAssertdefaultOutput, Cant find default output.

Negative 218 pWe have a working Drupal 7 production site developed by an outside vendor. Now I want a local development version on my office computer Windows, Im afraid.  I set up a WAMP stack, git cloned the working production site to my computer, and copied the database.  I also copied from the production site sitesdefaultsettings.php and sitesdefaultfiles .  The result partially works.p  pThe one problem that may not need sitespecific details is that no menu works.  Every place a menu is supposed to appear, Drupal generates the containers for the top level links, but these containers are empty.  Examples include the Megamenu and the black bar at the top you get on login.  adminstructuremenu lists our various menus, but the links under Operations list links, edit menu, and add menu do not appear. adminstructuremenumanagemainmenu for example shows the menu structure with the moveme icons but without any menu names or operations links. adminstructuremenuitem539edit for example shows all the proper information.p  pNote that it is not only menus that are not working.  Other stuff is missing.  Anything that gets shoveled into a template dynamically rather than specified by editing the content of some page is missing.  What is working  Anything you enter into any field when creatingediting a Basic Page or other page type is working.  So, for example, news stories show up fine we have a news page type, but a container that is supposed to show a news story title in an  tag is empty.p  pI must have missed something in trying to clone the production site because production works.  But I dont know what.  Maybe if I had an idea as to what could cause the problems above, it could give me a place to start looking.  Any ideas what might cause such a problems, especially something that might be missed in a git and db clonep

In my real dataset all the columns except codesppcode and codeycode can be specified by the codeidcode.p  pI want to end up with something likep  precode   id       date spp y    1 19850619   a 6    1 19850619   b 3    1 19850619   c 7    1 19850619   d 0    2 19850801   a 0    2 19850801   b 0    2 19850801   c 7    2 19850801   d 6    3 19900619   b 5    3 19900619   c 4    3 19900619   d 4    3 19900619   a 6    4 20000512   a 0    4 20000512   b 6    4 20000512   c 0    4 20000512   d 0 codepre  ul liIndicate added rowsli ul  pI will likely have to do this in the future with potentially much larger data frames, so a quick, efficient time and memory way to do this would be appreciated but any solution would satisfy me. I figure there should be ways to use the codedplyrcode, codedata.tablecode, or codereshapecode packages but Im not very familiar with any of them. Im not sure if it would be easiest to expand just rows id, spp, and y, then do a codeleftjoincode or codemergecode to recombine date and all the other variables in my real dataframe based on codeidcodep

Negative 218 pI understand the difference between Compare and Swap, and Thread locking for handling shared resources. What I dont understand is why you would use Compare and Swap over Thread Locking.p  pWhen contention for resources is high Compare and Swap would result in a large amount of CPU cycle wastage, hence is better to use Thread Locking in this case.p  pWhen contention is low Compare and Swap strongemcouldemstrong be used as CPU cycle wastage will be much lower, and the cost of this wastage strongemmightemstrong be lower than the cost of pausing and restarting threads.p  pWhen contention is low the frequency of the Compare and Swap or Thread locking operation, which ever is used, will also be low, so the cost saving will be less significant.p  pI guess what im asking now is two questions.p  pWhat is the time cost of a few wasted cpu cycles VS the time cost of pausing and restarting threads a few times, in Java  Cp  pAnd is there a specific frequency of contentions ie a number of contentions per second that determines it is better to use one over the otherp  pI imagine this becomes much more important for lowlatency applications.p

Negative 218 pI am relatively new to multithreading I started doing a tutorial or two this morning. I have a fairly CPU intensive program that runs on a 18 core computer. I usually use bash to start 18 processes going then start the next few and so on up to a total of 100200 tasks. I have written a little GUI in QT to prepare and analyse the output. I was hoping to extend the gui to executing and monitoring the jobs. I have so far worked out how to spawn a new process in QT. What is the best way to monitor the number of threads still being executed and then start a new job so that there are always 18 or some number of jobs runningp  pThanks.p

Negative 218 pI am working on an Android app that uses 5 ActionBar tabs to navigate between different pagesfragments. p  pstrongProblem is, that the navigation between the fragments is causing the UI to hangflicker.strong p  pThe UI of the fragments is not dynamic, meaning that it is not build with a static set of controls. When a fragment becomes visible apps starts to load the corresponsing view model, e.g. by loading a set of data from a server. As soon as the model is loaded the UI is generated. Thus showing a fragment includes the following steppsp  ol liShow an inderminante progress bar to indicate the running progressli liStart an AsyncTask to do the heavy loadingli liAs soon as the task is complete generate the UI, e.g. insert an ImageView for every loaded image.li liHide the progress bar and show the generated content.li ol  pI thought using a background thread to do the loading would avoid any UI hangs but this it not the case. The creation of the UI elements has to be done in the UI thread of course and it seems that this work is causing the UI hangs.p  pEven if the number of UI elements that have to be create is quite low e.g. create 10 Buttons the UI hangs for a moment. Thus using other strategies e.g. create visible elements only does not solve the problem. p  pOnly when strongnostrong UI elements are created at all the navigation between the fragments runs fluently. p  pstrongHow can I solve thisstrongp  pThe only solution I found so far is, not to load the view model  generate the UI when a fragment becomes visible  is created but as soon as the activity is created. In that case I would only show the activity once the view models  views of all fragments have been loadedgenerated. But this would mean to load a lot of data without knowing if it will be used at all. p  pstrongIs there any better solutionstrong Creating UI elements on the fly is not that uncommon, is it Thus there has to be a way how this can be done without blocking the UI. p

Negative 218 pBasic implementations of a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiDynamicarray relnofollowdynamic arraysa are size 2n, where half of the space is populated by existing elements, and the other half is reserved strongat the endstrong for appending new elements in O1 time. p  pInserting new elements anywhere other than at the end of the array requires reallocation of the array, which is an expensive operation.p  pAre there any C implementations of resizable arrays, where space is also reserved at the beginning of the array, for prepending elements efficiently If so, how much space is reserved compared to the space reserved at the end for appending I would imagine prepending is a much less common operation, but if it is happening often enough in a program, it could be devastating to reallocate upon each prepending operation.p
Negative 218 pOkay I have an API written in node.js that Im trying to add session functionality to. the API is completley RESTful. When the user logs in, I send the userpass combo with a GET ajax call to the login endpoint. The server then salts the password and compares it to the hash stored in my mongo db. It will then respond with true or false depending on the success of the login. p  pWhat I want to implement is this When a user enters a valid login, the server generates a session key. This key is stored in mongo in the users document. This session key is then returned with the GET request. This session key will then be included in the JSON body of all future requests to allow the user access to their account information.p  pMy question Is it safe to store this session key in the browsers localStorage or sessionStorage Will this open the user up to any vulnerabilities p

Negative 218 pLets say I have 3 columns each containing the same price, but in a different currency. I need to update the other two depending on which column has been updated. I presume I would need a base value in one of these currencies and somehow update this value when editing one of the cells in each column, then update the other columns by calculating the values using that base value.

Negative 218 pI have set up a webscraper with beautifulsoup, seleniumchrome, and python.p  pIt is pretty simple, beautifulsoup parses a page full of links, and selenium follows those links 1 at a time. Selenium finds a specific download link on each page and clicks it, starting a download. I would use beautifulsoup with this, but if I do not use a browser which clicks the link, it will send me to a page with a captcha.p  pAnyways, when selenium starts downloading the files, and the progess shows at the bottom of the screen with chrome. But, after a seemingly random amount of time, it says that the file is completely downloaded after only seconds before it was halfway done. There could be a 8 mb file, it only downloads 500 kb and then says it is finished. I dont know why it wont fully download the files, does somebody know a way to wait for it to actually fully download the file Is there a limit to how many files are able to be downloaded at once Because I am downloading quite a few files. p  pI have no clue what to do here, I hope someone can shed some light.p

Negative 218 pI am creating a singlepage AngularJS web app. My app needs to be able to query a backend service to get some information about a users state, and this state information needs to be available to the various pieces of the singlepage app. I created a service to manage this functionality, but Im having trouble hooking things up in a way that seems reasonable to me.p  pInitially, I had things set up like this...p  precodeltservice.jsgt ... var url  www.mybackend.com this.val  [              name undefined,         isValid false      ] http.geturl,      .success function data          this.val  data          .error function           this.val   [                              name error,                 isValid false                       ]      ... codepre  pAnd then in my controller...p  precodeltcontroller.jsgt ... scope.val  service.val ... codepre  pThis didnt work though codeval.namecode was undefined, presumably because codeservice.valcode was bound to the controllers scope before the codegetcode request had a chance to terminate. However, that does seem at odds  with what I read a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma12578750858003herea.p  pThe next thing I did was this...p  precodeltservice.jsgt ... var url  www.mybackend.com this.valPromise  http.geturl,  ... codepre  pAnd then in my controller...p  precodeltcontroller.jsgt ... scope.val  [              name undefined,         isValid false      ] service.valPromise     .success function data          scope.val  data          .error function           scope.val   [                              name error,                 isValid false                       ]      ... codepre  pThis worked, but I didnt like it. I feel like that logic belongs in the service.p  pSo the next thing I did was work through the various suggestions that I found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12576798howtowatchservicevariablesherea, although none of them seemed to have the desired effect. I also saw a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma15911810858003thisa, but it seems like overkill and not really applicable to my problem.p  pIdeally Id really like to figure out how to get my first attempt working tightly bind my service variable to my controller scope by reference, but if thats not something that can really be done within the Angular framework, Im happy to use some kind of codewatchcode behavior. Can anyone spot what Im doing wrong or why my service variable isnt getting properly hooked up to my controllerp

This happens only about 12 of the time.br br Goal to increase the number of successful likelyprobable matchesbr br Important note we are using a global data set and cannot enforce rules regarding the length of either value the parameter ANI or the values within [cANI]. br Case 1br The phone system transmits the source number 9876543210 which is used as the parameter ANIbr That exact number exists within the [cANI] column of the CustDataByANI table record 55555br The Select statement returns the values from a number of other columns affiliated with record 55555 Supereasy  WHERE [cANI]  ANI is successful.br br Case 2br ANI  strong1strong9876543210  same as above but with a leading 1br No exact match found within CustDataByANI.cANIbr Closest match in [cANI] is 9876543210 still record 55555br Even a child would recognize that the only difference from Case 1 is the presence of a 1digit prefix in the parameter ANI  perhaps it is a long distance tag or a country code.br Such prefixes could be 1 or 2 or even 3 digits in length....we cant predict.

Negative 218 pI am creating a geomipmapped terrain. So far I have it working fairly well. The terrain tessellation near the camera is very high and gets less so the further out the geometry is. The geometry of the terrain essentially follows the camera and samples a heightmap texture based on the position of the vertices. Because the geometry tessellation is very high, you can at times see each pixel in the texture when its sampled. It creates obvious pixel bumps. I figured I might be able to get around this by smoothing the sampling of the heightmap. However I seem to have a weird problem related to some bilinear sampling code. I am rendering the terrain by displacing each vertex according to a heightmap texture. To get the height of a vertex at a given UV coordinate I can usep  precodevec2 worldToMapSpace vec2 worldPosition      return  worldPosition  worldScale  0.5    float getHeight vec3 worldPosition           ifdef USEHEIGHTFIELD         vec2 heightUv  worldToMapSpaceworldPosition.xz         vec2 tHeightSize  vec2 HEIGHTFIELDSIZEWIDTH, HEIGHTFIELDSIZEHEIGHT  both 512         vec2 texel  vec2 1.0  tHeightSize          float coarseHeight  texture2DBilinear heightfield, heightUv,  texel, tHeightSize .r         float coarseHeight  texture2D heightfield, vUv .r         return altitude  coarseHeight  heightOffset     else         return 0.0     endif  codepre  pWhich produces this notice how you can see each pixelp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com2odr4.png altenter image description herep  pHere is a wireframep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comeU8Ag.png altenter image description herep  pI wanted to make the terrain sampling smoother.

Negative 218 pBeforehand I have to say that I actually got the visible effect Ive wanted but not in a satisfying way since, right now, constraints need to be broken instead of being properly updated.p  pI got a ViewController which holds a UITableView. The height of that codetableViewcode can vary from 0 not visible to whatever the number of rows it holds is. The height is calculated in the ViewControllers viewDidLoad by multiplying the current number of rows by the rows height.p  pThe first thing Ive tried was creating an codeIBOutlet weak var tableHeightConstraint NSLayoutConstraintcode connected to the height constraint set in the storyboard. It has just some random initial height but it is updated to the correct value within the ViewControllers codeviewDidLoadcode followed by method that updates the view if neededp  precodetableHeightConstraint  NSLayoutConstraintitem tableView, attribute NSLayoutAttribute.Height, relatedBy NSLayoutRelation.Equal, toItem nil, attribute NSLayoutAttribute.NotAnAttribute, multiplier 0, constant calculatedTableViewHeight   At this point Ive tried a variety of methods like the following two but actually none has worked for me view.layoutIfNeeded   or view.updateConstraints   or view.layoutSubviews codepre  p... and even the same methods on tableView just to be sure as well as putting all these in codeviewDidLayoutSubviewscode instead.p  pSo what I tried next was to create the same constraint as above but instead of updating I just added it to the view codeview.addConstrainttableHeightConstraintcode. This actually had the desired visual effect but in the logs I got a conflict of these two height constraints resulting in a break of the initial one. As my goal is to get a correct and clean code Ive kept trying. So this time I first removed the constraint from the view before adding the adjusted one again. Visually, again, everything was perfect but I still didnt get rid of the conflicting constraints.p  pSo my actual question is besides what I was doing wrong so far how I can  preferably  just update an existing constraint followed by a proper updaterelayout of the view and its subviews at any point, whether it is when I first load a view or whether I just want to change some constraints when the user interacts. Thanks a lot for any helpp

It works by replacing repetitive sequences of identical data items with short tokens that represent entire sequences. Applying RLE to a string involves finding sequences in the string where the same character repeats. Each such sequence should be replaced by a token consisting ofp  pthe number of characters in the sequence the repeating character If a character does not repeat, it should be left alone.p  pFor example, consider the following stringp  precodeqwwwwwwwwweeeeerrtyyyyyqqqqwEErTTT codepre  pAfter applying the RLE algorithm, this string is converted intop  precodeq9w5e2rt5y4qw2Er3T codepre  pIn the compressed string, code9wcode represents a sequence of 9 consecutive lowercase codewcode characters. code5ecode represents 5 consecutive lowercase codeecode characters, etc.p  pWrite a program that takes a string as input, compresses it using RLE, and outputs the compressed string.

So much for tolerance and openmindedness.p  pIll just leave this picture as a proof the program I was trying to unobscure is a worthy piece of software that could have interested many. If it ever gets public one day it will certainly not be thanks to a bunch of stupid downvoters.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comgQZkc.png altenter image description herep  h1The original questionh1  pIm trying to decipher an obscure part of a program that I want to port to better readability form.p  pThe only documentation accompanies this piece of code tells me we are generating a random plane in space from two direction cosines and a distance from the origin. Ive tried all day to decipher the program, and Ive made progress, but Im stuck one one specific line which still eludes me.p  pThe specific line seems to be about  generating the a,b,c components of the normal vector which are also the a, b, c in the equation of the plane from two angles, one which I understand to be the angle between the Z axis and the normal, and the other angle between the X axis and the normal.p  pAll the variables had obscure names, Ive renamed a few, when I understood their meaning, to more explicit names. The person who wrote this code is no longer here to give any explanation.p  pThe only output that is subsequently used is the three normal components normala, normalb, and normalc.p  pIn this first part the code generates the random parameters for the plane.p  precodevoid Planegenerateint i  the index of this plane                                as a sequence of planes is being generated here      tpt  i  10rndfloat  2  this looks a lot like the distance                                                               from the origin      tap  rndfloat  PI  2  rndfloat returns a rand float between 0 and 1      tat  rndfloat  PI  2     tit  .5  rndfloatPI.025COEFFTRANS  COEFFTRANS  1.5      taa  rndfloat  PI  2     tia  .5  rndfloatPI.0025.5COEFFTRANS codepre  pThen it determines the coordinates of the normal of the vectorp  precode    tat  tat  tit  this is most probably the angle from Z axis to normal     float ptt  tpt  costat.01tpt  tpt  ltltltltltlt the obscure line      normalc  1  sqrt1  pttptt  length of normal Z component  c     normalab  sqrt1  normalcnormalc  length of normal XY component  ab      taa  taa  tia  .31  this is the other angle, from X or Y axis to normal     float pa  tap  costaa.05  a bit obscure here also      normala  normalabcospa     normalb  normalabsinpa  codepre  pThe specific line that eludes me is the first line here  p  precode    float ptt  tpt  costat.01tpt  tpt      normalc  1  sqrt1  pttptt  length of normal Z component  c codepre  pI really have a hard time understanding what this ptt variable can represent.

Negative 218 pIm developing a multiplayer game for android using the google play services realtime mulitplayer api.p  pThe documentation says its possible for other players to join a running game. I dont want players to join a running game. What i do want is a possibility to automatch 2,3 or 4 players. So currently i usep  precodeRoomConfig.createAutoMatchCriteriaminNumberOfOpponents, maxNumberOfOpponents, 0 codepre  pwith min and max opponents set to 1 and 3.p  pIf 2 players connected to the game the onRoomConnected callback is called, and i start my game, which is fine.p  ol lipMy question is, is this room closed for other players afterwards or is it possible for other clients to connect to this room after that I would assume that room is fully connected and closed for other players , but cause the documentation says something about joining running games im not sure.pli lipAlso i give the players the option to only search for games with 3 opponents. In this case the device calls the autoMatchCritera with 3 and 3. Am i correct in the assumption, that if 4 clients search a game three with 3,3, and one with 1,3 these players get connected as i intent it pli ol

Negative 218 pI am currently attempting to implement a revision history screen in an MVC app. I need to be able to retrieve the names of fields which have changed in each revision using Envers. So I am following directions here a hrefhttpenvers.bitbucket.orgenverstrackingmodifiedentitiesrevchanges relnofollowhttpenvers.bitbucket.orgenverstrackingmodifiedentitiesrevchangesap  pI am using the second option since we have a custom revision entity. It looks like this p  precode[RevisionEntitytypeofMyRevisionListener] public class RevisionEntity  DefaultTrackingModifiedEntitiesRevisionEntity      public virtual Person User  get set   codepre  pAs you can see I am inheriting from DefaultTrackingModifiedEntitiesRevisionEntity in order to make sure the class has the property to hold the modified entities names. p  pPer the documentation this should create a table called RevChanges in which this information is stored with reference to the revisions table p  blockquote   pEnvers provides a simple mechanism that creates REVCHANGES table which   stores entity names of modified persistent objects. Single record   encapsulates the revision identifier foreign key to REVINFO table   and a string value.p blockquote  pI am never seeing this table created. I tried creating such a table myself along with a related class and wiring up the mappings, but I dont see how Envers would know to put the data into that table without me configuring it somehow. I just get an exception saying that the object is different from the target type when the get method is called on the new type.   p  pHow can I get this to work p
Negative 218 pI am trying to calculate the coordinates along a circle corresponding to the tap location.

Negative 218 pFrom a performance tuning perspective which one is more importantp  pSay a query reports 30 scans and 148 logical reads on a table with about 2 million records.p  pA modified version of the the same query reports 1 scan with 1400 logical reads.  Second query takes about 40ms less CPU time to execute.  Is the second query betterp  pI think so and this is my thesisp  pIn the first case, we have a high number of scans on a very large table.  This is costly on CPU and server memory, since all the rows in the table have to be loaded into memory. Executing such a query thousands of times will be taxing on server resources.p  pIn the second case, we have less scans even though we are accumulating a higher number of logical reads.  Since logical reads effectively corresponds to number of pages being read from cache, the bottle neck here will be network bandwidth in getting the results back to the client.  The actual work SQL Server has to do in this case is less.p  pWhat are your thoughtsp

Negative 218 pWe are developing a simple application in Linux for Desktop computer. The scheme is very simple and as belowp  ol liA main process which deals with the external world interface which gives some data periodically and spawns and keeps track of child processes. li liVarious child processes which process this data and report back to main process from time to time. li ol  pThe data coming in from external world interface is in the chunks of around 240 KBytes and 1 chunk comes in at the rate of roughly once per milliseconds. All the child processes use and work on the same data i.e. the complete chunk is sent to every child process when it arrives. p  pThe number of child processes is not fixed, can vary from 4 to 20. The scheme adopted for inter process communication is as followsp  ol liShared memory capable of holding multiple data chunks is created by all the processes using common key and using shmget and shmat APIs. Main process writes to this shared memory and all the child processes read from this memory. li liTo inform the child processes that new data chunk have arrived I have used pthreadcondbroadcast API. The conditional variable and the corresponding mutex used for this purpose reside in a small separate shared memory and are initialized to default attributes in the main process. li ol  pSo whenever new data chunk arrives roughly once per 1 ms main process calls pthreadcondbroadcast and the child processes which are waiting on pthreadcondwait read this data from the shared memory and process it. The problem I am facing isp  pDepending on the processor load, sometimes the pthread signals are getting lost i.e. either delivered to only some or none of the waiting child processes. This severly affects the data processing as the data continuity is lost and the child process is not even aware of it. Processing time of the child process is average 300 micro seconds and this application is running on a multicore processor. p  pTo pin down the problem I even created a dummy application with 1 main process and several dummy child processes who does nothing but to wait on pthreadcondwait. From main process I called pthreadcondbroadcast every 1 ms and a count was incremented and printed, similarly every time a pthread signal was received in a child process another count was incremented and printed. When I ran this test program I found after some time the receivers count began to lag the senders count and the gap between their count went on increasing. Am I right in my understanding that this was due to some pthread signals not delivered Are there any other fast plus secure IPC mechanisms.p  pI even tried the same thing using internet domain sockets using UDP datagrams in broadcast only for the synchronization purpose while the data was still read from the shared memory. But here also I noticed as the number of child processes increased the synchronization signals were getting lost.

Negative 218 pI am using strongbwconncompstrong method to get connected component of this image.  img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comHIN1r.jpg altenter image description here There are four strongconnected components bounded by red boxesstrong and strongevery starting pointstrong of every connected component is strongmarked by a yellow pointstrong.The coordinate of that strongyellow point is x , ystrong strongwhich is only for the first component from leftstrong. At the first connected componentwhich is now a separate image from the left side , you see a strongblue point which is the gravity center of that particular connected componentstrong. I can easily calculate that strongblue point coordinate as x1 , y1strong.

Negative 218 pMy Django 1.62. application contains a showmembers viewtemplate that shows the names and photos of all members on my site.  The catch is that I have to review each members photo before allowing it to be displayed on the showmembers page.  Therefore, when a new member joins, I display a placeholder image until Ive reviewed and approved their photo.  Once thats done, their real photo should be displayed on that page.p  pNow currently I use the same name for both the placeholder image and the real photo.  This allows me to easily display either image on the showmembers page with this HTMLp  precodelt Part of showmembers.html   placeholder and photo both named usernamethumb.jpg gt ltimg src MEDIAURL photosapproved username  username thumb.jpg gt codepre  pThe problem is that when a new user first joins the site, the showmembers template will show their placeholder image from the server plus the photos of other site members usually from the clients browser cache as it should.  However, once Ive approved the new users photo, their old placeholder image will continue to appear in the client browser unless the clients user forces a refresh while bypassing their cache.p  pIs there a way I can programmatically force the showtemplates page to repull the new users new approved photo from the server while still retrieving the cached images for the other users  I realize that I could give different names to the placeholder image and approved photo and then pass a boolean to the template and use it to display one or the other.  However, that seems like a rather inelegant solution.   Is there another customary way to do thisp  pThanksp

Negative 218 pI am new to application insights and have set it up using no custom events and Im using all the defaults. The application is build on MVC 5. In the ApplicationInsights.config theres a comment sayingp  pWhen implementing custom user tracking in your application, remove this telemetry initializer to ensure that the number of users is accurately reported to Application Insights.p  pWe have a page where you are required to login so the default user logging isnt saying that much and we would much rather have the username being the unique identifier. Based on the comment it seems like this should be some kind of common modification and therefor easy to modify. When trying to google on custom user tracking I do not find anything interesting which seems a bit odd...p  pSo how do I link the user in Application Insights to my username instead of going on some cookie which seems to be the default behaviourp

Negative 218 pI need to make two drop down lists. Lets say the first one containing food categories Ice Cream, Pizzas, Noodles, Milkshakes. p  pSo if I pick ice cream the second drop down list would contain Chocolate, Vanilla, Mint and so on. And if I pick Pizzas at the first one, I want this second one to change dynamically so that it would contain Pepperoni, All Meat, and so on.p  pHowever, I need the second drop down list to be populated by the values I already have in my database. So lets say if Im out of chocolate ice cream there would be no chocolate in the second drop down list.

Negative 218 pWhile investigating packings of spheres I ran into this problem where I have a list of vectors and I want to know how many planes they generate.  Im generating these lists of vectors that point from the center of a sphere to a contact point on the outside surface of the sphere and I want to know how many of these vectors are coplanar.  For example I want an algorithm that will do the following..p  pGiven the vectors 1,2,3, 2,4,6, and 0,6,9 it should report that there is only one unique plane generated by either one of the first two and the third.p  pAll of my attempts havent gotten anywhere because every time I count how many planes are generated I drastically over count.  I feel like this should be an easy thing to do and Im also curios if there is any linear algebra that can somehow come to the rescue.  If I can determine how many planes are generated and what those planes are I think it will be easy to determine how many vectors lie in each plane which is the last part of this problem.  If anyone can think of a more general approach to any dimension two or greater that would actually be ideal but for now this is all Im concerned with.  p

Frustratingly, as long as Im setting the value to something besides 0, it will change.p  pIve debugged it, watched a sliders codeValuecode property change for values greater than 0, verified that the controls in the codesliderscode array corresponded to the controls I intended them to, verified that the codeMincode property was 0 and even changed it to an absurdly low number on the off chance it wasnt inclusive, so I cant imagine why itd behave this way.p  pIts actually not terribly important since a sliders value isnt counted when its disabled, but it is bugging the hell out of me, so Id appreciate any insight on this.p  precodePrivate Sub UpdateSliderComponentsi As Integer     Dim enable As Boolean     enable  Not daysOffi.Value      If Not enable Then         slidersi.Value  0     End If     labelsi.Enabled  enable     slidersi.Enabled  enable End Sub codepre

Negative 218 pI have a crossplatform Project that depends on a number of my own Libraries. The Project and each Library have their own respective repositories, that see regular changes.p  pThe Libraries are abstract modules that are still evolving alongside the Project, but which arent specific to that Project although currently, said Project is driving most of those changes. The Project depends on these, so Library changes should always be committed before associated Project changes i.e. changes which have been made because of changes to the Library interface.p  pstrongMy problem is I often forget to commit the Libraries changes first,strong in SourceTree.p  pFor now, Ive created hard links to the Library files, in my Project folder. This way, because the OS handles the links, I dont need silly relative paths that exit the Project folder e.g. code......my.hcode, which may change when Project folder structure changes as has just occurred. More to the point, this ensures that I will see changes to these files in SourceTree in the Project, and commit them every time as part of the Project. Re the Library repos, well, I can commit the same changes as and when I finally notice in SourceTree that those repos have changesets this being the task I usually forget to do first. Good enough... for now.p  pstrongIs there a better way to handle this simplystrong I would prefer not to have Libraries  committed as part of the Project emalsoem  unnecessary duplication. Ive also tried .gitignore on the hard links in the Project, so that I will never commit them as part of the Project repo, but then of course I am back to square one  because I only look at the Prject, I still forget to commit Library changes before Project changes... emwhich means any given build may be broken because associated Library changes are not present for that commitem.p

Negative 218 pIve been stuck on this problem for a few days now and so far have been unable to find a solution.p  pIve setup 2 Magento shops that are in most ways identical same shop, but just a different language but are 2 separate installations. For the past couple of months I have had the product images disabled, but before then they were working fine. This was until the other day ago that I tried to once again enable the product images. On site A everything went ok, the images were being displayed and everything on the page was normal. But on site B there was just a blank section where the image was meant to be. I could still see the small image on the catalog page where all products are displayed. After inspecting the element the only difference I could see between the 2 sites was that on site B  was empty. After many hours spent looking online for a solution I tried the following and was still unable to get the image showingp  ul liChecked file permissions are okli liIncreased the max memory size of phpli liDeleted cache in both var and in the mediacatalogli liDeleted the .htaccess fileli liDisabled extensionsli ul  pI should also mention that during this time if i switched the design of the product page to modern the image displayed. I may have missed something here since its been a few days, but after none of this was working I began looking through some of the files that are used such as codelocal.csscode, codemedia.phtmlcode, codeview.phtmlcode, codelocal.xmlcode, however i could not find any major differences between the 2 sites, just a few extra white spaces that i removed.p  pI then came across an answer on here that mentioned the following in codecatalog.xmlcodep  precodeltreference namecontentgt         ltblock typecatalogproductview nameproduct.info templatecatalogproductview.phtmlgt             lt            some codes here             gt             ltblock typecatalogproductviewmedia nameproduct.info.media asmedia templatecatalogproductviewmedia.phtmlgt            lt            some codes here             gt         ltblockgt    ltreferencegt codepre  pI looked in the codecatalog.xmlcode and found that both site A and B did not contain this bit of code, but the modern template did.

I could see the product image, but now it was displaying it twice A few blocks were also missing, the product descriptionreviewshare tabs that are normally visible below the picture were not visible.

Negative 218 pI have a UITableViewCell which has 50px of height and I would like to change this height to 300px and to append one more view insight the new height. I did a project which you can download and test with all the code and functionality a hrefhttpswww.dropbox.comsfx9k3xovbj9yt6lCellBug.zipdl0 relnofollowLink to the project on DropBoxa. The main problem is that when the cell random cell is selected the height is changing correctly but the new view with brown color is not visible although I can print its frame, type and so on its not nil neither hidden. It works well if I select the first cell from the beginning and then all the rest cells work correctly. So its something with the reusing of the cell but I couldnt find the exact solution. Thank youp

Negative 218 pI am having problem trying to solve the following problem from UVAp  pGiven a list of variable constraints of the form codeA lt Bcode, you are to write a program that prints all orderings of the variables that are consistent with the constraints. For example, given the constraints codeA lt Bcode and codeA lt Ccode there are two orderings of the variables codeA, Bcode and codeCcode that are consistent with these constraints codeA B Ccode and codeA C Bcode.p  pInputp  pThe input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating the number of the cases following, each of them as described below. This line is followed by a blank line, and there is also a blank line between two consecutive inputs.    The input consists of two lines a list of variables on one line, followed by a list of constraints of the form codeA lt Bcode on the next line. Variables and constraints are separated by single spaces.    All variables are single character, uppercase letters. There will be at least two variables, and no more than 20 variables. There will be at least one constraint, and no more than 50 constraints. There will be no more than 300 orderings consistent with the constraints in a specification.p  pOutputp  pFor each test case, the output must follow the description below. The outputs of two consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.    All orderings consistent with the constraints should be printed. Orderings are printed in alphabetical order, one per line. Characters on a line are separated by a space.

This way SQLiteOpenHelperonUpgrade will be called.p  pHere I would do something like thisp  precodeprivate static final int DATABASEVERSION  2  Previous one was 1         private static final String DATABASENAME  mydatabase.sqlite public static final String DBPATH  datadatamypackagedatabases   private IfcDatabaseContext context              supercontext, DATABASENAME, null, DATABASEVERSION             ctxt  context             try                  if existsDatabase                      SQLiteDatabase tempDb  getWritableDatabase                     copyDatabase                               catch SQLException eSQL                  Log.e, Can not open database              catch IOException IOe                  Log.e, Can not copy initial database                        private boolean existsDatabase          File dbFile  new FileDBPATH  DATABASENAME         return dbFile.exists       private void copyDatabase throws IOException          AssetManager asset  ctxt.getAssets         InputStream myInput  asset.openDATABASENAME         String outFileName  DBPATH  DATABASENAME         OutputStream myOutput  new FileOutputStreamoutFileName         byte[] buffer  new byte[1024]         int length         while length  myInput.readbuffer gt 0              myOutput.writebuffer, 0, length                  myOutput.flush         myOutput.close         myInput.close       Override public void onCreateSQLiteDatabase db        Override public void onUpgradeSQLiteDatabase db, int oldVersion, int newVersion              db.execSQLDELETE FROM mytable             db.execSQLltquery to insert all rows from mynewdatabase.mytable to db.mytablegt   codepre  pSo my question is, how should I make this query to insert all rows from mynewdatabase.mytable to db.mytable Should I use something like ATTACH DATABASE s AS mynewdatabase And in that case, how to write that queryp  pOther question I would like to show a popup to the user whenever a new database version is detected, but, how to do this Should I show the popup inside the onUpgrade method or there are other ways to detect databases versionsp  pAnd my last question, in Android, the userversion field of my SQLitemaster table is not usedp  pThank youp
