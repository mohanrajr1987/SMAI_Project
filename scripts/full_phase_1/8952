Positive 8952 pIve been looking into this for quite a long time and still havent found any satisfying solutions.  We have a few shared libraries .csprojs which also have dependencies on each other as well as 3rd party dlls.  I want to have these shared projects referenced in several .sln files.  p  pIn the past we have tried to make this work with NuGet.  We made all our shared components packages and had a local feed.  However, when we wanted to update our shared components it would often mess up in the update process and wasnt reliable.  It is causing us more headaches than its worth and honestly makes us not want to add Shared code into our shared libraries.p  pSo, now Im believing its better to just have a reference to the shared project in each solution, thats easy enough but now theres a further issuep  pWe use feature branching and the shared code isnt part of the branch.  We have a structure similar to the followingp  blockquote precodeApp1   Development  Folder that just contians Main branch      Main   Features   Folder that contains all Features      F1 App2   Development      Main   Features      F1      F2 Shared    Development      Main codepre blockquote  pHowever, If we make changes to the shared in any of the features  and it is pointing to the code in SharedDevelopmentMain then it just updated for all of my features and we dont keep a record of shared changes.  p  pWhat is the right way to solve these issues  Is there a better way to share components between solutions  p

Positive 8952 pHopefully this doesnt get too complicated...p  pIve built a thirdparty C library codelibfoocode with both static codelibfoo.acode and shared codelibfoo.socode versions. The object files were created with fPIC. codelibfoocode has several global variables that are used to configure its behavior, and functions that rely on these globals, for simplicity function codefunc1code which interacts with variable codeglobalacode.p  pI have built my C shared library codelibbarcode that Ive statically linked to codelibfoo.acode. This is done without the wholearchive option. So I believe codelibbar.socode includes all the symbols and definitions it needs from codelibfoo.acode. This library calls functions from codelibfoocode which uses global variables to control behavior. In this case, lets say it calls function codefunc1code.p  pFinally, I have a C client program codebazcode that dynamically links to both codelibfoo.socode and codelibbar.socode. This client also uses the same functionsglobal variables from codelibfoocode. It modifies codeglobalacode and calls codefunc1code.p  pIn general, what will be the behavior of the client codebazcode in this scenario Is this sort of configuration something I should avoid, or is it OK And what would happen if codelibfoo.acode and codelibfoo.socode are different versionsp  pFor the global variables I was sort of expecting that the code in codelibbar.socode would use its own copies, and any changes in codebazcode would modify the copies in codelibfoo.socode, but thats not what I see. When codebazcode modifies codeglobalacode, the effect is seen in codelibbar.socode. There wasnt any other abnormal behavior from client codebazcode that I could tell.p  pI also tried linking codebazcode with codelibfoo.acode, and see the same apparently correct behavior.p  pValgrind in either case has no shown any errors.p

Positive 8952 pI recently took over some RPM work while one of our colleagues is away. During the post installation step, the RPM installs some libraries in a particular location, writes a file to etcld.conf.so.d containing the path to these files, and then runs ldconfig. But when the call is made, there are quite few messages stating that libXYZ.so is not a symbolic link. p  pI looked at the files and the sym links are not set up correctly. E.g., libA.so.1 and libA.so.1.1 are identical files, instead of libA.so.1libA.so.1.1. Whenever ldconfig is run on a system with the RPM installed, these messages are shown.p  pNow for no particular reason, I tried replicating this by creating a shared library called libmylib.so.1.1. Then I created another file called libmylib.so.1 which was identical to the previous file. I added a test.conf file to etcld.conf.so.d which contains the path to these shared libraries, and then ran ldconfig. But I didnt see any of these not a symlink messages. Instead ldconfig set up two symlinks to both these files. Is that message displayed only under particular circumstancesp  pAlso, when Im installing shared libraries, do I need to setup the links such asp  plinker name  so name  real namep  pmanually And then run ldconfigp  pThis is my first time working with RPM and installing shared libraries, so any input would be appreciated.p  pThanksp

Positive 8952 pI want to clear up a confusion I have regarding shared libraries.

Negative 8952 pIn C, a functions signature depends partly on whether or not its const.  This means that a class can have two member functions with identical signatures except that one is const and the other is not.  If you have a class like this, then the compiler will decide which function to call based on the object you call it on if its a const instance of the class, the const version of the function will be called if the object isnt const, the other version will be called.p  pIn what circumstances might you want to take advantage of this featurep

Negative 8952 pI got assigned to work on some performance and random crashing issues of a multithreaded java server. Even though threads and threadsafety are not really new topics for me, I found out designing a new multithreaded application is probably half as difficult as trying to tweak some legacy code. I skimmed through some well known books in search of answers, but the weird thing is, as long as I read about it and analyze the examples provided, everything seems clear. However, the second I look at the code Im supposed to work on, Im no longer sure about anything Must be too much of theoretical knowledge and little realworld experience or something. p  pAnyway, getting back on topic, as I was doing some online research, I came across a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions511552readingfromasocketnotwaitingforinputstrongthis piece of codestronga. The question which keeps bothering me is strongIs it really safe to invoke getInputStream and getOutputStream on the socket from two separate threads without synchronizationstrong Or am I now getting a bit too paranoid about the whole threadsafety issue Guess thats what happens when like the 5th book in a row tells you how many things can possibly go wrong with concurrency.p  pPS. Sorry if the question is a bit lengthy or maybe too noobie, please be easy on me  thats my first post here.p  pstrongEditstrong Just to be clear, I know sockets work in fullduplex mode and its safe to concurrently use their input and output streams. Seems fine to me when you acquire those references in the main thread and then initialize thread objects with those, but is it also safe to emgetem those streams in two different threadsp  pstrongrspstrong p  pSo Ive checked Suns code and codePlainSocketImplcode does synchronize on those two methods, just as you said. codeSocketcode, however, doesnt. codegetInputStreamcode and codegetOutputStreamcode are pretty much just wrappers for codeSocketImplcode, so emprobablyem concurrency issues wouldnt cause the whole server to explode. Still, with a bit of unlucky timing, seems like things emcouldem go wrong e.g. when some other thread closes the socket when the method already checked for error conditions. p  pAs you pointed out, from a code structure standpoint, it would be a good idea to supply each thread with a stream reference instead of a whole socket. I wouldve probably already restructured the code Im working on if not for the fact that each thread also uses sockets codeclosecode method e.g. when the socket receives shutdown command. As far as I can tell, the main purpose of those threads is to queue messages for sending or for processing, so maybe its a Single Responsibility Principle violation and those threads shouldnt be able to close the socket compare with a hrefhttpwww.objectmentor.comresourcesarticlessrp.pdf relnofollowSeparated Modem Interfacea But then if I keep analysing the code for too long, it appears the design is generally flawed and the whole thing requires rewriting. Even if the management was willing to pay the price, seriously refactoring legacy code, having no unit tests what so ever and dealing with a hard to debug concurrency issues, would probably do more harm than good.

Negative 8952 pHi this is a question to all experienced developers who create their web applications using ASP.NETC with MySQL. I am currently using the Microsoft Enterprise Library to implement a database factory design pattern. p  pI have a DAL which returns a DataTable. I have a BLL that executes that DAL which returns a Listlt of my DataObjects. The BLL has parameters for sorting, limit records, and filters.p  pWhat do you think is by far a good design pattern that will work for transactional queries and queries containing a number of joins 4 to 10 tables and conditions.p  pI am not satisfied with the current implementation and I dont know if itll work for me in the long run. I keep on creating DataObjects  BLL  DAL classes every time.p

Negative 8952 pI am not familiar with templates, but I wonder, if it is possible to use them for setter and getter methods.

Is there a more elegant way to write those functions or it is common practice to do like above in such situations And if its common to use templates, I would appreciate example how you would use them in code above.p  pAnother question I would ask is how should getters and setters be properly declared. Is it good coding stylep  precodedouble getAvoid const void setAconst doubleamp a  double getBvoid const void setBconst doubleamp b  double getCvoid const void setCconst doubleamp c codepre  pI mean should getters be always const and setters take as argument reference to an object, rather than copy it, which would be probably a little bit slowerp

Negative 8952 pI have a large number of XML documents which are created in docbook and, through maven, are published in both an html for and a pdf form.

The images are a collection of screenshots, some are full screen, some about 23rds width and height, and others are small search boxes.  Its obvious that I need to do a massive refactor of the attributes of the imagedata.

So I could run Close on the client in the terminating Disconnectmethod of the callback. Or I could use the Abortmethod on the callback serverside and skip using a Disconnectmethod on the callback. I dont know which one I preffer honestly. Hmmmm.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI went with the Abortapproach. It seemed like the most logical method and it works really well. The client gets notified with the Faultedevent on the callbackinstancecontext. Nice.p

Negative 8952 pThe openclosed principle seems to be about preventing regressions in an object or method. Given that your code is covered by tests because youre practicing BDD this seems a redundant requirement. In addition it seems to introduce additional complexity by requiring extensibility at the API level rather than the language level.p

Negative 8952 pI have a form in codepage1.phpcode which directs to codepage2.phpcode from where the data from the form in codepage1.phpcode is inserted into database. after successful insertion, codepage2.phpcode displays a message and gives link to go  to a third page.p  pThe problem is when the user after the insertion hits the back button of the browser and clicks the form submit button, insertion is made again.p  pIs there any way so that after one insertion when the back button is pressed a message will be displayed showing that visiting the backbutton is not allowed Or in  case it is allowed no insertion will take place on clicking the form submit buttonp  pEDITED LATER  TO ADD THIS PART p  pokk let me tell in details. it is about an admin back end. the admin gives description text input for different products. He gives the input from page1.php and message is shown on page2.php that the description has been inserted into db. then there is another form below the message. It just asks whether the admin wishes to do  more with description text. If yes, then clicking on the form submit button , he is taken to a page from where across some pages he is again taken to page1.php  this time for another product, from there to page2.php and so on.  btw i could use a normal page link instead of the form button link below the message on page2.php p  pThe problem is, while  the admin is on page2.php and hits the back button , he goes back to page1.php and from there if he hits on the form submit button, the data is inserted for the second time in a new row.p  pu may suggest to use IGNORE with INSERT command, but there are other columns in the row which may not get matched with those of  another column while the description columnsadmin inserts text data for this column  may get matched. p  p1Is ignore applicable in this casep  p2What should be the solution if duplicate entry is allowed for the database of the sitep  pthanks p  phope it makes the whole thing clear.p

Negative 8952 pThanks in advance for reading.  This is a picky design question in that I have an adequate solution, but question if there isnt a better way via templates, which Im not very experienced with.p  pI have a series of types of data tables derived from abstract class DataTable which I need to store.  I wrote a DataTableIndex abstract class which stores a vector DataTables and which handles the general work common to all DataTableIndexes  doing lookups, implementing a Proxy pattern so tables are only loaded if needed, error checking, etc.  p  pI then subclass it for each table type, the only reason I need to do so is because each table type has a specific function to be called to load it.p  pId like to avoid this subclassing of DataTableIndex somehow via templates if possible, because there are lots of subclasses of DataTable.p  precodeclass DataTableIndex       various functions to implement lookup, Proxy and error checking      functionality common to all DataTableIndexes.    This code needs access to lookupTable and theTables    DataTable getTable int tableNum   private    These functions call the appropriate user interface function for loading      a table of the subclass type.      They are called by more general nonvirtual public functions   virtual bool loadIndex vectorltLookupEntrygtamp returnLookupTable   0   virtual DataTable loadTable int tableNum   0    vectorltLookupEntrygt lookupTable   vectorltDataTablegt   theTables    UserInterface UI    codepre  pThis class has then very simple subclasses, which basically point to functions in the User Interface class that actually open and parse the file of the data table.  p  precodeclass TableTypeAIndex  public DataTableIndex    virtual bool loadIndex vectorltLookupEntrygtamp returnLookupTable          return UIgtloadTableAIndex lookupTable        virtual DataTable loadTable int tableNum             return UIgtloadTableTypeA lookupTable[ tableNum ]       codepre  pThis works adequately.  But I feel like I should be able to pass loadTableTypeA for example to DataTableIndex via a template parameter, so I dont have to subclass it.  p  pAnother reason why I would like to use templates is that I dont want to have to cast DataTable all of the time to the actual table type.  Even though I know at compile time what type of table it should be, I feel like I should be using dynamiccastlt to error check, but I dont want the caller of getTable to have to do this every time it is called often.p  pMy ideal solution would  1 generalize the DataTableIndex class to a template, with template parameters replacing LookupEntry and DataTable in lookupTable and theTables.  This would eliminate casting.p  p2 map the appropriate UI functions to load the right table type, without subclassing.p  pSo basically Id like to the use of this class to look like this somehowp  precodeDataTableIndexlt LookupEntryTypeAMatlab,                  TableTypeA,                  loadTableAIndex,                 loadTableTypeA gt theTypeAIndex codepre  pI gave some thought to policy classes, but my impression of that approach was that, in this case, Id just be moving the subclassing to something else.p

I agree that its generally not needed. The problem is that we dont control what our clients do with their computers we plan to sell hundred of copies.p  pWorse  one of our machine exhibits this problem without any manual intervention. I guess the OS Windows XP regularly synchronizes its clock to the RTC clock, and this makes the OS clock go back in time naturally.p  h3Epilogueh3  pI found out that some statements in my question were wrong. There are actually two separate causes involved in my initial problem. Now, I can say two things for sure p  ol lipOn my machine only archlinux with kernel 2.6.37 with an OpenJDK 64 bits 1.6.022, codeThread.sleepcode, codeObject.waitcode, codeThread.joincode, codeLockSupport.parkNanoscode have the same problem  they wake up only when the system clock reaches the target time of awakening. However, a simple codesleepcode in my shell does not exhibit the problem.pli lipOn all the machines I tested included mine, codejava.util.Timercode and codejava.swing.Timercode have the same problem they are blocked until the target time is reached.pli ol  pSo, what Ive done is that I replaced all the javas codeTimercode by a simpler implementation. This solves the problem for all the machines but mine I just hope my machine is an exception more than a rule.p

Negative 8952 pIs there a way, using the new Facebook API, to detect whether a user is logged in or not on facebook, without any relation to the facebook app  This should be all done in clientside javascript on a page on a website. p  pIn more detail According to the facebook documentation, getLoginStatus will detect a user is logged in if the user is logged in and connected to your application.  On the other hand, it will report the user is logged out if the user is either not logged into Facebook, or has not authorized your application.p  pTo me, this implies that getLoginStatus will never work the first time a user uses your application, because the first time any user is using your application, heshe has not granted any permissions to your application.    p  pMoreover, what specific permissions does the user have to grant the app for getLoginStatus to work if the user is logged in  I have checked this list of permissions on the Facebook API documentationp  pa hrefhttpdevelopers.facebook.comdocsauthenticationpermissions relnofollowhttpdevelopers.facebook.comdocsauthenticationpermissionsap  pand have seen no mention of any permission that relates to this sort of detection.p  pThis my first time using the Facebook API and it is very frustrating.

Negative 8952 pIm trying to do something along the lines ofp  h2in some object Ah2  precodeUITableVIewController viewController [someObjectB setupView viewController] codepre  h2in some object Bh2  precodevoid setupViewUIViewControllerview      if the pointer passed in is of type UITableViewController then ...     say, for instance with [[view class] isKindOfClass [UITableViewController class]]     or [view isKindOfClass [UITableViewController class]]  codepre  pHowever, I have two problems  First, the fact that the parameter enters the method in B as UIViewController which is a superclass of UITableView which Im doing because this method will also configure other types of view controllers. So Im wondering, if I pass in UITableViewController to a method parameter of type UIViewController, isKindOfClass still does dynamic binding right That is, the runtime checks the type of the content, regardless of the static type of the pointerp  pSecond, notice I did not initialize the pointer in object A before passing it to B. I actually want B to initialize it. But then buy question becomes, how do I test the static pointer type on an uninitialized pointer That is, inside B [view isKindOfClass [UITableViewController class]] gives me a BADEXEC. My guess, because Im obviously trying to access a jul pointer. So is there a way to still test based on the pointer static type declarationp  h2ADDENDUM cause I added it as a comment instead, sorryh2  pLet me rephrase that part of the question in more specific terms I want obj B to create a variable of type UITableViewController, pass it to A and have A realize its been given a pointer to UITableViewController, so that it can actually initialize this pointer to a specific subclass of UITableViewController and then obj B pass that now initialized object to some other object. p  pMy reasoning behind wanting to do this is the following scenario I have a navigationControllerbased app. Its got a root controller with buttons and depending which button is pressed, the root controller instantiates and pushes table controllers for different tables of a database and, in turn, when clicking on a row of those tables, the tables instantiate and push a detailed view controller.p  pSo far so good, but because of the nature of the project, I want to keep the whole navigationcontroller instantiatepush chain agnostic to the fact that theres a database and that the tables and detailedview controllers are actually specific subclasses of UITableViewController and UIViewController, respectively. p  pThis means the flow would be p  p1 On click, root controller passes generic UIViewController to my custom main controller.p  p2  This main controller realizes its been passed a generic table, initializes it to a specific subclass defined by me and does a few things to provide it with data from the sql database.p  p3  The root controller, not caring whether the generic UIViewController is a table or not or even a subclass of UIViewController, merely pushes it to the navigationController.p  pThe idea, also, is that then I dont need to include headers for the table subclasses in the root controller. Only the custom main controller knows about these.p  pSo, at the end of the day, the way I see of doing it is by being able to determine what is the type of the pointer being passed, regardless of whether this pointer is nil, points to garbage or points to an actual object. Meaningp  pUIVIewController a  static type declaration, determined at compile time.p  pa  [some subclass of UIVIewController alloc] init]  dynamic type of the pointers content, determined at run time, probably by following links through activation records.. similar to virtual in Cp

Negative 8952 pIm using OpenGL 3.3 on a GeForce 9800 GTX. The reference pages for 3.3 say that an invalid operation with glBindFramebuffer indicates a framebuffer ID that was not returned from glGenFramebuffers. Yet, I output the ID returned by glGenFramebuffers and the ID I send later to glBindFramebuffer and they are the same.p  pThe GL error goes away, however, when I change the target parameter in glBindFramebuffer from GLDRAWFRAMEBUFFER to GLFRAMEBUFFER. The documentation says I should be able to use GLDRAWFRAMEBUFFER. Is there any case in which you cant bind to GLDRAWFRAMEBUFFER Is there any harm from using GLFRAMEBUFFER instead of GLDRAWFRAMEBUFFER Is this a symptom of a larger problemp

Negative 8952 pWeve hooked up the ISaveOrUpdateEventListener event and hoped we could tie it to a progress bar update for each node being visited during the save traversal of a pretty big model, BUT the event only fires once when the save operations starts only on the node on which the Save  was inititated and not on any subnodes. p  pAre there any other events that are more appropriate to listen to for thisp  pWeve also tried breaking up the save operation of a hierarchical model by doing the traversal ourselves, but that seems to degrade the performance even further. p  pPerhaps were trying to solve a problem for which FNH wasnt aimed to be used.

Negative 8952 pOur product is an ASP.Net web application.  Currently, we use Web Site Projects in Visual Studio, but have been looking into using Web Application Projects for quite some time.  I am currently researching them so that we can hopefully improve our deployment process.p  pWe have a base web site that is shared and common between different clients, and then we extend that with clientspecific functionality in client Web Site Projects.  The client projects extend base, and therefore rely on its contents.  To build the full product, we first deploy the base web site, and then overlay it with the content from the client project.p  pIn looking at converting to Web Application Projects in Visual Studio, we were hoping to be able to create the base project, then create client projects and set up references to base.  This structure seems to work OK, but when we are attempting to deploy the application from the client project using MSDeploy, only the dll from the base web site is being published.  This is fine for some things, referencing the compiled code is useful, but there are other items like images, js pages, htm, etc that is still source that is required for the client application to function.  We need more than the compiled code from our base web site.p  pThat all being said, I can think of a few options herep  ol liContinue to deploy in 2 steps.  First the base web site, then the client web site to build the full product.li liModify the deployment process to copy the required source files from the base projectli liRearchitect our model to support this baseclient relationship in a different manner.  Not quite sure how this would work, and would be the leastviable option.li lili ol  pIs there a different option that I am missing  Am I doing something wrong with the way I am setting up my projects  Is there more to making a Web Application reference another Web Application beyond sharing compiled code  If thats the case, why wouldnt you just use a shared class library  Or maybe I am missing something with the MS Deploy processp  pI am open to suggestions here as I feel like I am missing something. I dont think our model for our web applications is too unique.  p  pUpdate The dualdeploy process does work, but feels a little kludgey.  Any other inputp

Negative 8952 pSo basically i have a little application that loads two plugins and codeconnectcode them. First plugin after its loaded it creates a label without any title  which will be added to main window. Second plugin creates an action which will be added to a menu. So my app  need just to load these plugins and to codeconnectcode them . What i mean by connecting them  i mean that label plugin contains a slot which will modify labels title , and action plugin has a signal declared. Application should codeconnectcode action plugin signal with label slot. I do not know how to do it exactly. My guess is that in action plugin class  implementation is to connect custom   signal with a standart signal triggered. But anyway this ways my app is not working as i expected. How can i make a correct connection in my app for a signal from one plugin and slot from another plugin p  pHere is my code for Label Plugin p  precodeinclude LabelInterface.h  class LabelPlugin  public LabelInterface       QOBJECT     QINTERFACESLabelInterface  public     QLabel label     QLabel newLabel      LabelPlugin      LabelPlugin   public slots     void setTextforLabel    include ltQtGuigt include LabelPlugin.h  QLabel LabelPluginnewLabel       label  new QLabel     return label   void LabelPluginsetTextforLabel       labelgtsetTextThis plugin works fine    Exporta pluginul QEXPORTPLUGIN2 labelplugin,LabelPlugin codepre  pAction Plugin p  precode    include ActionInterface.h      class ActionPlugin  public ActionInterface            QOBJECT         QINTERFACES ActionInterface      public           QAction myAction          QAction newAction          ActionPlugin            ActionPlugin        public slots          void sendsignal       signals           void pushMyAction       include ltQtGuigt include ActionPlugin.h  QAction ActionPluginnewAction       myAction  new QActionShow text,this      return myAction   void ActionPluginsendsignal       qDebug ltltHere      QActionconnect this,SIGNALpushMyAction,this,SIGNALtriggered   QEXPORTPLUGIN2 actionplugin,ActionPlugin codepre  pIn my app , where i try to load plugins i have p  precode   foreach QString fileName, appDir.entryListQDirFiles           qDebugltltQStringfileName          QPluginLoader pluginLoaderappDir.absoluteFilePathfileName          QObject plugin  pluginLoader.instance           if plugin               ActionInterface myAction qobjectcastltActionInterfacegtplugin              if myAction                  action  myAction                 pluginMenugtaddActionactiongtnewAction                           LabelInterface myLabel  qobjectcastltLabelInterfacegtplugin              if myLabel                  labelmyLabel                 layoutgtaddWidgetlabelgtnewLabel                           if action ampamp label                   qDebugltltboth loaded                  actiongtsendsignal                 connectaction, SIGNALpushMyAction,label, SLOTsetTextforLabel                          else qDebug ltlt seems one plugin is not loaded               codepre

Negative 8952 pIm trying to create a table class, whos rows and columns may expand or shrink, to store ints and strings as a first Java project. The data structure Im trying to use to represent the table is an ArrayList of ArrayLists, where the initial arrays elements all point to a new array list  so the initial array kind of serves as an entrance into rows. This would be a picture of how I have it in my mind, for reference a hrefhttpimgur.comP2h8P relnofollowhttpimgur.comP2h8Pa The problem Im having is accessing the inner ArrayLists. Ive been reading a bit of documentation, and I cant seem to understand the big issue with why Im not able to access the inner lists. Some code here p  precodeimport java.util.ArrayList  public class Table       private int length, width     private ArrayList newTable      public Table      this.length  this.width  0                  Testing a few functions           public static void mainString[] args           Just testing a few functions.

Still work which       needs to be done here.       param column            public void displayColumnint column          if this.newTable.size gt column              for int i  0 i lt this.newTable.size i                   This doesnt work.

Negative 8952 pSo Ill still with the disclaimer that I finally started learning Rails about a week ago...p  pI am working on building out an application that would list events for multiple bands that I work with.

This is reflected in my model right now as...p  precodeclass Venue lt ActiveRecordBase   hasmany events end  class Event lt ActiveRecordBase   belongsto venue end   codepre  pSimple rightp  pThe problem I am trying to wrap my head around is how should the data input happen The set up would insinuate that the user would create a venue and then add an event to it. However, the event is really the focal point in here for me. The workflow for entering this data most logically is 1 enter a date 2 enter a citystate 3 select the venue for that city. Some venues will already be in the system and others wont. When the user starts typing in the venue name after filling in the location data the form will begin to suggest various venues that match the location and the typing god knows how I will make that work but thats a problem for another night.  All location data for the event is stored in the Venue table. The Event table stores just the specifics for that event date, venueid, artistid, etc.p  pWould you just create this with a formfor the Venue model amp use fieldsfor for the Event model I guess that seems to make the most sense but it just seems wrong in my head. The more I type the more I feel like I am over thinking this but it would be nice to get some feedback on how you would set this up.p  pThanksp

Negative 8952 pI am binding parameters in a URL to a hashmap like this     myObjectWithMapInIt[theKeyString].valuetheValuep  pWhen I list the keyset of the hashmap, I get two values relating to each parameter e.g.     param name keyString value theValue     param name 27keyString27 value theValuep  p27 is the URL excape code for single quote, , so I can see why I might get this INSTEAD of the ordinary parameter name as a entry in my map, though why both The same happens with other escaped characters such as space.p  pFor info, I am using Java with the Stripes framework though I dont think thats relevant, its pretty standard binding of a request parameter to a variable in a backing bean object with a HashMap in it.p  pThanksp

Negative 8952 pIDbSetExtensions.AddOrUpdate is meant to help write code that works the same whether the database is empty or populated.  But linking objects needs different code.  When the database is empty, objects dont have IDs yet and you link them by assigning the navigational property.  When the objects already exist, however, navigational properties dont work and you need to set the foreign keys directly.  delNavigational properties do work for proxies in both cases, at the cost of forfeiting POCOs.del Edit Actually, proxies dont work when both entities are old.p  pThis sample crashes in the second SaveChanges call, when EF tries to set CountryID to 0p  precodepublic class Country      public virtual int ID  get set      public virtual string Name  get set    public class Person      public virtual int ID  get set      public virtual string Name  get set       public virtual int CountryID  get set      public virtual Country Country  get set    public class Context  DbContext      public DbSetltPersongt Person  get set      public DbSetltCountrygt Country  get set    class Program      static void Foo              using var db  new Context                      var c  new Country             var c  db.Country.Create             c.Name  usa             db.Country.AddOrUpdatex gt x.Name, c              var p  new Person             var p  db.Person.Create             p.Name  billg             p.Country  c             db.Person.AddOrUpdatex gt x.Name, p              db.SaveChanges                   static void Main              Database.SetInitializerltContextgtnew DropCreateDatabaseAlwaysltContextgt         Foo         Foo       codepre  pHow is AddOrUpdate usedp

Negative 8952 pI m working on a lead management system , which is supposed to store property informationfor sale as a lead. So far I have given the feature to create a new lead in the system for the owner , where he enters details of the property and a new record in created in the db.p  pNow what is required in reality is there are many different sites with forms on them that collect the property information. Client wants that we should generate a code to be put on these sites so that the information entered in those forms is also saved in out lead management system. I believe I would need to provide a curl code to be placed in those sites.Please correct me if I am wrong. Another issue is all those forms on these sites have their own field names and there is no way to map those field names with the field names in our database. Can anyone suggest what options do I havep
Negative 8952 pI have an app that, after some clicking, shows activity with news contents. I want at a bottom of that to show comments, which are dynamically loaded in async task.p  pOne approach is to use ListView and custom ArrayAdapter, but, i would have to put ListView inside a ScrollView, and it is is a problem, even if i manually override ListViews height.

Negative 8952 pI have three or more observable sequences of codeboolcodep  precodeIObservableltboolgt a0  ... IObservableltboolgt a1  ... IObservableltboolgt a2  ... codepre  pThese sequences generate mostly codefalsecode values but once in a while there is a codetruecode the sequences can also be empty. Im not interested in the values themselves but rather in the order of the codetruecode values. So if codea0code is codetruecode, then codea2code is true and finally codea1code, Id like to perform some actionp  precodea0, a2, a1 gt ...do something... codepre  pBut if the codetruecode values appear in another order, Id like to do something elsep  precodea2, a1, a0 gt ...do something else... a0, a1, a2 gt ...do something entirely else... codepre  pSo Im only interested in the first codetruecode value of each sequence and depending on the order in which they occur, Id like to perform some action.p  pI could record the timestamp of each first occurrence of codetruecode and then sort in a codeCombineLatestcode call, but I have a feeling there is a better way. One problem with this approach is that I am now dependent on granularity of recorded timestamps.p

Negative 8952 pI need to have a lightweight tool for text stream clustering. Lightweight in the sense that it doesnt have memory so that it can remember the previous text entries. Text stream here means continuous feed of alphanumeric and semi structured sentencesphrases eg logs of any application. similarity based clustering means that the algorithm should cluster the texts in groups having the pattern similarity. eg text1  aaababac and text2  aaaaabac should be grouped together since only one characters differs between them. And the scenario is  first text1 comes up the algorithm should give it an index. then the text2 comes up now the algorithm employs the same method to give it an index. but the condition is the both indexes should be near to each other and while processing text2 the algorithm has no idea what came up in earlier texts.  It is sort of pattern similarity based hashing. p  pNow I cant find anything useful. The best solution that I found was simhash. a hrefhttpmatpalm.comresemblancesimhash relnofollowhttpmatpalm.comresemblancesimhasha p
Negative 8952 pI have a web application that I am trying to make more efficient by reducing the number of database queries that it runs. I am inclined to implement some type of Comet style solution but my lack of experience in this department makes me wonder if a more simple solution exists.p  pFor the sake of brevity, lets just say that I have a database that contains a list of systems on a network and their current status whether they are up or down. A user can sign into the web app and select which systems she is interested in monitoring. After which she can visit the monitoring page which displays the number of systems that are currently down.p  pAs of now the count is refreshed using Ajax... every minute the client sends a request to the server which in turn runs a query against the database to get the current count and returns the result to the client. I know this in inefficient for every client that logs in, another query is run against the database every minute. On  badp  pI know that I can use some type of caching, such as memcached, but it still means there is a request for every user every minute. Better, but I still feel as if its not the best solution.p  pI envision something more like thisp  ul liEvery minute the server runs a query to pull a count for all the systems that are currently down.li liThe server then pushes this data to the interested clients.li ul  pThat way it doesnt matter how many users are logged in and watching the monitoring page, the server only ever runs one query per minute. O1  good The problem is that even after all of the research Ive done I cant quite figure out how to implement this. To be honest I dont completely understand what it is that I am looking for, so that makes it very difficult to research a solution. So I am hoping that more enlightened developers can lead me in the right direction.p

Negative 8952 pI understand that tail recursion, is a special case where a function makes tail calls to itself. But I do not understand how tail calls and tail recursion are different.  In properly tail recursive language with implemented TCO Tail Call Optimization, like Scheme, it means that tail calls and tail recursion do not consume stack or other resources. In a language where compiler can not optimize tail recursion, program can run out of stack and crash. In properly tail recursive languages, implementing tail recursion for looping is no less efficient, than using a loop, I presume.p

Negative 8952 pI am developing a distributed system which consists of different components services which are loosely asynchronously coupled via JMS ActiveMQ.p  pThus I do not want to reinvent the wheel, I am looking for a well known protocol  library that facilitates remote procedure calls inbetween these components and helps me deal with method interfaces.p  pSo lets decompose the problem I am already solving right now via dirty solutionsp  ol listrongA consumer component wants to call a service, thus it constructs a request string handwritten and dirtystrongli liThe request string is than compressed an put into a JMS message dirty aswellli liThe request message is than transmitted via JMS and routing mechanisms that part is okli listrongThe service first of all needs to decompress and parse the request string, to identify the right method dirtystrongli liThe method gets called and the reply goes like 2  4.li ol  pSo that looks pretty much like SOAP, whilst I think that SOAP is to heavy for my application and further I am not using HTTP at all. Given that I was thinking that one might be able to deconstruct the problem into different components. p  ol liPart A HTTP is replaced by JMS that one is okayli liPart B XML is replaced by something more lightweight alright, a hrefhttpmsgpack.org relnofollowMessagePacka comes in handy hereli listrongPart C Mechanism to parse requestreply string to identify operation name and parameter values that one is the real problem herestrongli ol  pI was looking into a hrefhttpwiki.msgpack.orgdisplayMSGPACKDesignofRPC relnofollowMessagePacka, a hrefhttpcode.google.compprotobufrpcpro relnofollowProtocolBuffersa, a hrefhttpthrift.apache.org relnofollowThrifta and so forth, but what I dont like about them is that they introduce their own way of handling the actual TCP communication. And bypass my already sophisticated JMS infrastructure which also handles load balancing and stuff.p  pTo further elaborate Part C above, this is how I am currently handling it Right know I would do something like the following if a consumer would call a service, lets assume the service takes a text and replies keywords. I would have the consumer create a JMS message and transmit it via ActiveMQ to the service. The message would containp  precode Syntax OPERATIONNAME [PARAMETERS]  Method GETALLKEYWORDS [String text] returns [JSON String[] keywords]   Example Request GETALLKEYWORDS Hello world, this is my input text...  Example Reply [hello, world, text] codepre  pNeedless to say that it feels like hackedtogether. The problem I see is if I would be to change the method interface by adding or deleting parameters, I would have to check all the requestreply string constructiondeconstructions to syncronize the changes. That is pretty errorprone. Id rather have the library construct the right requestreply syntax by looking at a java interface and throwing real exceptions on runtime if I do mess up stuff, like Protocol Exception Mandatory parameter not set or something...p  pAny projectslibs known for thatp  pRequirements would bep  ol liIts small and lightweight and fast.li liIts implemented in JAVAli liIt doesnt serve too many purposes like some fullblown framework e.g. a hrefhttpwww.springsource.org relnofollowSpringali ol

Negative 8952 pI wish to show the solution to a puzzle.  I have a canvas created as a separate view and included in my UI.  I want the dots displayed in this canvas to sequentially jump over adjacent dots to vacant locations.  The goal is to show that a solution for a particular puzzle exits.  However, when I exercise reasonable code to do so, it behaves as X11 and may other graphic engines would.  It appears to coalesce the invalidate calls.  The program does NOT display each move.  It pauses an appropriate amount of time for showing the individual steps and then displays suddenly displays the final board configuration. Most perplexing.p  pI have tried a sleep approach and pushing the invalidate statement to other places. But it seems always to boil down to a single invalidate call, rather than sequential calls.p  pThanks.p

So Im thinking something like thisbrp  precodeltdiv idpaymentgt     ltdiv idimagegtltdivgt     ltdiv idpaytextgtltdivgt ltdivgt  ltscriptgt document.readyfunctione      ifltphp echo isloggedin gt          payment.loadfunction              .ajax                 data this.serialize,  get the form data                 type POST,  GET or POST                 url Scriptspay.php,  the file to call                 complete functiondata                      ifdataYes                          image do some jquery to make the correct image display here                         paytext.textYah you paid                      else                          image do some jquery to make the correct image display here                         paytext.textSorry you didnt pay                                                                   ltscriptgt codepre  pSo basically the script would echo back codeyescode or codenocode. And I only want to evaluate this load after the user has logged in i need to see if that specific user paid. So is my logic write or am I way offp

Negative 8952 pI have a setup in which two nodes are going to be communicating a lot. On Node A, there are going to be thousands of processes, which are meant to access services on Node B. There is going to be a massive load of requests and responses across the two nodes. The two Nodes, will be running on two different servers, each on its own hardware server.brbrp  pI have 3 Options HTTP1.1 , rpccall4 and Directly sending a message to a registered genserver on Node B. Let me explain each option.brbr bHTTP1.1bBRBR Suppose that on Node A, i have an HTTP Client like codeIbrowsecode, and on Node B, i have a web server like codeYaws1.95code, the web server being able to handle unlimited connections, the operating system settings tweaked to allow yaws to handle all connections. And then make my processes on Node A to communicate using HTTP. In this case each method call, would mean a single HTTP request and a reply. I believe there is an overhead here, but we are evaluating options here. The erlang Built in mechanism called codewebtoolcode, may be built for this kind of purpose. brbr brpccall4bbrbr I could simply make direct rpc calls from Node A to Node B. I am not very susre how the underlying rpc mechanism works , but i think that when two erlang nodes connect via codenetadmping1code, the created connection is not closed but all rpc calls use this pipe to transmit requests and pass responses. Please correct me on this one.brbrbSending a Message from Node A to Node B bbrbr I could make my processes on Node A to just send message to a registered process, or a group of processes on Node B. This too seems a clean option. brbr bQ1.b Which of the above options would you recommend and why, for an application in which two erlang nodes are going to have enormous communications between them all the time. Imagine a messaging system, in which two erlang nodes are the routers  brbr bQ2.b Which of the above methods is cleaner, less problematic and is more fault tolerant i mean here that, the method should NOT have single point of failure, that could lead to all processes on Node A blind  brbrbQ3.b The mechanism of your choice how would you make it even more fault tolerant, or redundant brbr bAssumptions b The Nodes are always alive and will never go down, the network connection between the nodes will always be available and noncongested dedicated to the two nodes only , the operating system have allocated maximum resources to these two nodes.brbr Thank you for your evaluationsp

I am using a SQL Server account that has codesysadmincode rights to connect via ODBC ODBC needs to be used because Visio wont recognise the native connector, a well documented deficiency, and a trusted connection cant be used as I also have local admin rights and our company refuses to recognise local admins on cross machine connections.

If I change the ODBC connection to use the native client type it allows me to select the stored procedures, unfortunately the views box is still not able to be selected.p  pI connected with Access using the plain SQL Server type of ODBC to see what I would be able to link and it allows me to see all tables, views, including system tables and views, which tells me the sysadmin rights are being preserved through the ODBC connection.p  pAm I missing something here A number of searches on SO and Google have turned up nothing about why Visio cant see certain objects disregarding security permissions as I have admin access, and being able to see them via Access has made me a bit more frustrated, as I would emassumeem both products utilising an ODBC connection of the same type would encounter the same restrictions and functionality.p  pstrongHow do I get Visio to let me use the Reverse Engineer functionality to put the views from the SQL Server into my Visio documentstrong Ive done this before with other servers in the past.p

Negative 8952 pThis is my setup Table in a MySQL database containing 30minute time slots whole and half hour A website that shows a table for a period of time how many rooms are available for booking at each time slot. Minimum booking is one hour so each booking reserves two slots at least and when reserved the slot before them becomes unavailable cannot book a room for 30 minutesp  pMy question is this I use PDO transactions in a php script to reserve a number of slots for a booking by changing their state two columns of enum types. So if lets say two or more customer try to book a room at the same time slot or perhaps the one before it what happens if I use SELECT FOR UPDATE Does the first one continues with the procedure and the others are rejected by either an error or an empty set or do the others wait after the first one finishes and commits the changes in the database in the case he booked or rollback in the case he changed his mind and afterwards the second fastest customer tries to selects the rows and updates them or not depending on the actions of the firstp  pBasically I want to know if I have to implement some sort of retry system.p  pAlso, I was curious when is that temporary lock removed only after the transaction is committed in case of transactions both mysql, autocommit off or on the next update that affects someall of the rows in the select statementp

Negative 8952 pI recently upgraded my environment from Eclipse Ganymede to Eclipse Juno. My application was using the old maveneclipseplugin, so I had to make changes in the .classpath and .project and .settings files so that the m2e plugin in eclipse juno gets all the information correctly. I did this by following this link  a hrefhttpblog.frankel.chmigratingfromm2eclipsetom2e relnofollowhttpblog.frankel.chmigratingfromm2eclipsetom2ea    p  pMy application runs perfectly fine using tomcat7 and maven also works fine. My issues started when I tried to run a test as junit test in eclipse. This gives me a ClassNotFoundException. As a side note even if I add my testclasses folder as a classpath variable in eclipse, it still has issues because then it says it cannot find the resources folder. This very same environment worked perfectly fine with the earlier eclipse, maven plugin and classpath configuration. So I dont know what has changed.    p  pI am sharing with you my project structure and classpath details.

Negative 8952 pSo after much deliberation and a bit of frustration at spending time trying to search for memory management issues i did some research and finally succumbed to changing to ARC. And it was relatively painless. However a new issue has surfaced to do with my UIViewControllers, Prearc they all worked as advertised, I pushed them on the stack, they appeared, I popped them off the stack their dealloc method was called and everybody was happy. Changing over to ARC, no dealloc is called, ever. which is unfortunate. So I did some research into the problem, let me list out what i am doing andor not doingp  p.firstly, the view i am pushing onto the stack is not explicitly declared strong.p  p.the delegate the child class has of the parent class is unsafeunretained, but for covering bases i even commented out setting the delegate to the parent, no joy.p  p.Turned Off NSzombies as apparently that will cause stuff to stick around in ARC enabled codep  p.i changed my code, according to brad larsons answer in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8747942memorynotreleasediniosviewhierarchyMemory not released in ios view hierarchya, from thisp  precodeif friendsListVC  nil       friendsListVC  [[FriendsListViewController alloc] initWithNibNamenil bundlenil]     friendsListVC.delegate  self   [self.navigationController pushViewControllerfriendsListVC animatedYES]  codepre  pfriendsListVC is a member variable.

From what i have read about it should be 0 for gray and 1 for pure color.

Negative 8952 pI am drawing one Texture2D to the screen. This texture starts as a blank completely transparent 800350 texture. This texture is loaded from LoadContent to two different Textures as blankTexture and filledTexture. Then I draw pixels to the filledTexture in my update method. The filledTexture is drawn with sprite batch, and the process is repeated.p  pThe filledTexture is renewed at the start of each update call, to get rid of the pixels that were there, so it can be refilled. I found that renewing the texture simply did not get rid of the old data properly, and here began the issues. First, I tried setting the filledTexture  to blankTexture at the beginning of every call, but this still retained the data from the previous call. Then I tried the followingp  precode    public void LoadContentgraphicsDeviceManager graphics, ContentManager content              some code          blankTexture  content.LoadltTexture2Dgtblank         filledTexture  content.LoadltTexture2Dgtblank          some more code          public void Update                    filledMap  new Texture2DgraphicsDevice.GraphicsDevice, blankMap.Width, blankMap.Height          some code that messed around with the pixel locations         Color[] color  new Color[1]         color[0]  someNewColor         some code that set the new position of the pixel          where R is a 1x1 rectangle with some location         this sets one pixel of the filledMap at a time at R.Location         filledMap.SetData0, R, color, 0, 1           public void DrawSpriteBatch batch              batch.DrawfilledMap     codepre  pNow, these methods work fine and all. Except, every 20 seconds or so the frame rate would drop by about 20 to 30 points and then return to normal. I couldnt possibly see a reason for this, as all code paths were run constantly, the number of pixels was going up at a constant rate and staying there, so the frame drops wouldnt be so inconsistent.p  pI opened up task manager, looked at the physical memory, aaaand it turned out the RAM was filling up and dumping itself every 20 seconds or so. After commenting out the line of code that set the filledMap to a new Texture2D at the start of each update, the memory leak was gone about 1.5 gigs were filled and dumped every 20 seconds. So I need some ideas on how to clear up the memory properly Using texture.SetData was too frame rate costly it would drop to about 2 FPS quickly, so I guess that method is out. Any ideasp  pThanks for the helpp

Ive extended the timeout to be 15000. Ive selected USE ADBHOST. Ive disabled my AVG and firewall. Ive uninstalled AVG off my phone. Ive rebooted my machine twice. Ive even tried looking at the Windows Host file CWindowsSystem32Hosts and checking that the local host is set to 127.0.0.1. Nothing seems to work.p  pWhats strange though is that almost every 20th time, it will successfully connect and begin debugging and I can step through the application line by line.

Negative 8952 pa hrefhttpwww.atlantisshrugged.com relnofollowon my live website that I createdap  ptheres a big problem Im having. On the page linked to, which is also the home page of the site, there is an image gallery that performs the following functions 1 I have a directory in my html file structure called publichtmlimageslightbox where all of the images that will be displayed are stored. A php script dynamically takes the contents of that directory using the scandir function, and then takes that PHP array returned by this function, implodes it into a PHP string, assigns that PHP string to a javascript string, and then splits that javascript string to a javascript array which stores the filepaths of the images stored in the publichtmlimageslightbox directory.p  p2 There are two javascript functions called prev and next. next is called automatically every 4.5 seconds, incrementing an indexing variable that moves through the array of images. This goes on in the background regardless of user interaction with the webpage there is a counter that makes next execute every 4500 ms using the method setTimeout.p  p3 The user can trigger the execution of prev and next by pressing two buttons, which are absolutely positioned relative to the div that contains the image gallery. Upon the pressing of either button, corresponding to either next or prev being called, either function is immediately executed, whereupon the timer for the next execution of next will restart from 4500 ms.p  pIt all works out fine, but when I first open the site with a web browser, the images lag upon changing. After the images have all been cycled through, they do not lag anymore is this because they have been cached in the browser, but the first time it is viewed on a web browser, the lagging as the image URLimage is changed spoils the user experience and makes the website come across as poorly designed.p  pHeres the code Many thanks.p  precode ltphp     path  imageslightbox     gallery  scandirpath     arrayshiftgallery arrayshiftgallery     foreachgallery as ampimage          image  path . image               gallerystring  implode , gallery     gt      ltscriptgt     function          prev.onclick, .prev         next.onclick, .next          ltscriptgt     ltscriptgt     var gallery new Array     var gallerystring  ltphp echo gallerystring gt     gallery  gallerystring.split       var ImageCnt  0      .prev  functionevent          if ImageCnt  0     ImageCnt  gallery.length  1            else                                   ImageCnt  1                                           lightbox.cssbackground, url  gallery[ImageCnt]  .cssbackgroundsize,670px         clearTimeoutt         t  setTimeout.next, 4500         event.stopPropagation           .next  functionevent         ifImageCnt lt gallery.length1            ImageCnt              else       ImageCnt  0            lightbox.cssbackground, url  gallery[ImageCnt]  .cssbackgroundsize,670px         ifevent  undefined              clearTimeoutt             event.stopPropagation                  t  setTimeout.next, 4500           var t  setTimeout.next, 4500     ltscriptgt codepre

Negative 8952 pOk so i am developing a really simple multiplayer game in .NET that will be played on LAN.p  pThe Problem is that in order for the game to work i have to send the whole object. Previously i have made a chat system by using codeTcpClientcode and codeTcpListenercode to send messages. However i am not sure that sending objects is possible or even desirable in this case.p  pWhile searching on SO somebody suggested using serialization. However upon some research i discovered that all classes whose objects are referenced by the serialized object must also be serialized. Now the object i must sent contains quite a few reference to other objects. Meaning to use serialization i must infact serialize almost every class in the program.p  pNow i am not sure which approach to use. codeTcpClientcode or serialize or something else p

Negative 8952 pOk, this might be a duplicate, but as I couldnt really get anything out of possibly similar questions, here is mine Im working on a small PyQt4 program where I can enter the name of a song in a QLineEdit and then add a QLabel of it beneath it. I want a button beside each one of these labels that deletes the label when clicked. Relevant codep  precode    def Addself           self.rf QtGui.QLabelself.le1.text,self         self.rf.move45,30         self.rf.resize450,30         self.rf.show           self.x  QtGui.QPushButtonX,self         self.x.move10,30         self.x.resize30,30         self.x.show         self.x.clicked.connectself.Del       def Delself          self.rf.close         self.x.close codepre  pNow, what Im not understanding is how I can assign a different instance to each of these dynamically added Qlabels, in order to delete the specific one when the button is clicked.p  pThe best idea I had was creating a variable containing a number that would change with each added QLabel, something like var  rfstrnum and num  0, then adding 1 to num for each QLabel and then using getattr for the instances, so getattrself, var  Qtgui.QLabel..., which unfortunately gives me an error that I cant assign that value to the function. And I cant create a dictionary since I have to have different instances for that. p  pAny ideas would be highly appreciated, thanks a lot. p

When I objdumpd executable test I found virtual address 0x430210 contains strcpy function. While on loading the corresponding PLT entry found at location 0x6c2008 gets changed from 0x400326 virtual addr of next instruction iesetting up the resolver to  0x0x443cc0 virtual addr of a libc function named strcpysse2unaligned I dont why it gets resolved to a different function instead of strcpy I assume its a different variant of strcpy.p  pHaving done this analysis I realized I missed the basic point upfront How come dynamic linker can come into picture when loading a static executable I dont find a .interp section so dynamic linker is not involved for sure. Then I observed, a libc function libccsuirel modifies the PLT entries and NOT dynamic linker. p  pIf my analysis makes more sense to anyone, please let me know whats it all about.

Negative 8952 pMy objective is to instrument a file with few code fragments.

But due to some reason from future import division statement should always come first in a python file. So to instrument I would be searching for a string from future import division in the file and when ever I find it i would instrument after that line. The following scenario shows it.p  precode A.py        start of the code       from future import division     print  i successfully instrumented  lt inserted code     import os     .....     ....     print from future import division     ....      end of the code codepre  pBut instead i get a scenario like this p  precode   A.py        start of the code       from future import division     print  i successfully instrumented  lt inserted code     import os     .....     ....     print from future import division     print  i successfully instrumented  lt inserted code     ....      end of the code codepre  pMy search algorithm couldnt differentiate between an actual code or a string.

Otherwise I have to manually write copymove constructorassignment for codework1code and codestaticcastcode to base classes explicitly, which is buggy, error prone, and maintenance hazard.li ul

Negative 8952 pI was just curious how this worked. Cant seem to find much detail on it. Probably not wording the question right in my searches. But basically, how does the compiler resolve names in what order does it search through the namespaces listed in the using statements at the beginning of a C filep
Negative 8952 pI dont know if I am asking this right, which is part of the problem.  We use NFS on our linux   boxes.  We have mounts to directories on file servers.  We use 1 hour attribute timeouts and 1 hour data timeouts.  We have to models of writing files.  1 We add to the end of files.  When adding to the end of files, we keep the same file name.  2 Changing previously written data.  When changing a file, we change its file name.  The idea is that this will work well With caching, because data that gets written to a file is never changed.  I need one more thing to make this work.  With the current settings, I get bus error when I access a newly added part of a file using mmap when that part of the file didnt exist at the time the attributes were cached.  This all makes sense and is expected.  What I would like to do is force NFS to refresh the file attributes so it knows that the file is larger now.  In a perfect world, I would do this only when I got a bus error.  So... is there a command I can execute from c or the shell that can do thisp  pstrongEDITstrong I got down voted, so I guess my question is stupid.  Maybe more information will help.  When I use a mount that has a long attribute and data refresh, I get the microsecond performance I require.  When I use a mount with a short attribute refresh, it becomes 1000x slower.  I need the attribute refresh only when I get bus error.  This is linux, so there is a good chance that a method exists to force this refresh.  Our data only changes once every 20 minutes so I would like to explore the refresh on demand scenario.p

Negative 8952 pIm pretty new with Android programming. But I have been working on this for over a week now, and it starts to get booooring.p  pMy idea is that I want to connect two devices using Wifi Direct. But I only want to connect to those which are running my application. Besides, I want the users to be able to see some information of the other devices such as user name, not just the MAC or the AndroidXXXX name included in the WifiP2pDevice. Thats why I decided that a device looking for other devices, should both start the application service and search for peers which are also broadcasting this service.p  pThe problem Im testing with two real devices is that, even though they are running exactly the same code, only one of them is getting the service discovery callbacks the onDnsSd... listeners below. So, one side acts in the proper way, but not the other. Moreover Im getting old services, meaning that apparently each time I start de service even though I cancel previously started services, that service seems to be still broadcast during at least some minutes.p  pI include a shortened version of my codep  precodepublic class MoveFlufietsDialogFragment extends DialogFragment implements ChannelListener, DeviceActionListener       public final HashMapltString, FlufietsPeergt mBuddies  new HashMapltString, FlufietsPeergt      Override     public Dialog onCreateDialogBundle savedInstanceState      ...         mIntentFilter.addActionWifiP2pManager.WIFIP2PSTATECHANGEDACTION         mIntentFilter.addActionWifiP2pManager.WIFIP2PPEERSCHANGEDACTION         mIntentFilter.addActionWifiP2pManager.WIFIP2PCONNECTIONCHANGEDACTION         mIntentFilter.addActionWifiP2pManager.WIFIP2PTHISDEVICECHANGEDACTION          mManager  WifiP2pManager getActivity.getSystemServiceContext.WIFIP2PSERVICE         mChannel  mManager.initializegetActivity, getActivity.getMainLooper, null         ...         startRegistration         discoverFlufietsService         ...            public void discoverFlufietsService          DnsSdTxtRecordListener txtListener  new DnsSdTxtRecordListener              Override             public void onDnsSdTxtRecordAvailableString fullDomain, Map record, WifiP2pDevice device                   This and the next listener are only called in one of the devices.

I only get the callbacks called onDnsSd... in one of the devices.p  pAnd that thing about getting old services, when I always clear them, is weird I do include a timestamp in the service record data, and I could always discard all but the last, but doesnt seem to be logical.p  pAny ideas ANY help would be VERY appreciated, because writing the application is not funny any more p  pThanks a lotp

Negative 8952 pSuppose I have a hash set of request IDs that Ive sent from a client to a server.  The servers response returns the request ID that I sent, which I can then remove from the hash set.  This will be run in a multithreaded fashion, so multiple threads can be adding to and removing IDs from the hash set.  However, since the IDs generated are unique from a thread safe source, lets say an codeAtomicIntegercode for now that gets updated for each new request, does the codeHashSetcode need to be a codeConcurrentHashSetcode  I would think the only case this might cause a problem would be if the codeHashSetcode encounters collisions which may require datastructure changes to the underlying codeHashSetcode object, but it doesnt seem like this would occur in this use case.p
Negative 8952 pIm using Java Crystal Report SDK for generating reports using stored procedures or ResultSets.p  pHere is a post I made few months ago, trying to execute the stored procedure of my subreport within a report using a ResultSet  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq13602963864216Java Crystal Report SDK  Report amp SubReporta. In this case, I knew the parameters to set for executing my stored procedure, so it was easy.p  pNow, Im trying to do the same thing ie executing a stored procedure for populating my subreport within a main report using a ResultSet but in a generic way  I dont know in advance the parameters, so I have to set each one using the codeParameterFieldControllercode but some come from the main ResultSet, others from static variables in the main report etc.p  pI realize that there is a lot to do and many cases to cover in order to be as generic as possible. While when I dont set a datasource for my main report, all that stuff is well done automatically.p  pSo, is there an easy way to mix ResultSet and stored procedures in report and subreports  p  pOr is there a way to bypass the codeuseDatasourcecode method  that certainly decides to use the main ResultSet for each subreport instead of given stored procedure.p  pI have to keep the ResultSet for the main report and not reexecuting its stored procedure for performances reasons.p  pAfter a lot of tries, Im back here.

Negative 8952 pI am running into a bug where a table view may lose track of a section header, creating a new section header in its place. See the following image the right screen shot shows the lost header.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com98Ogu.png altenter image description herep  pAlthough I do not know the exact cause, this seems to happen when I programmatically scroll the table view and update it at the same time by calling beginUpdates and endUpdates. Can anyone explain why the table view loses track of the section header When exactly does this happenp  pBelow, I have provided code for a view controller that demonstrates this problem. The code displays a table view whose data model is an array of arrays of strings. When you press the add button, a new row is added to the table and is scrolled into view. After a brief moment of being added, the new row is made taller than the other cells to show that it is the newly added cell. To reproduce the bug, press the Add button several times and then scroll to the top. I tested this in the 4inch 64bit iPhone simulator.p  pThe code that may be causing the bug is in the strongpressedAddButtonstrong method because it is there that I scroll and update the table view at the same time.

Negative 8952 pSo i have been working hard at a game using HTML5 and JavaScript. I am trying to make a space invaders styled game and as a result i have an array of enemies. I have separate functions dedicated to creating the array of enemies, drawing them to screen, moving the enemies and finally removing them.  the removal of enemies however is causing an issue. This is my logic if an enemies health is less than or equal to 0, delete the enemy from the array and shrink the arrays length by 1. Now logic would dictate that this can be a calamity, if you start shooting and killing enemies from the start of the array, as the arrays length will be reduced and this is exactly my problem, so low and behold my code.p  precodefunction hostilex, y      this.speed  1     this.health  100     this.x  x     this.y  y     this.height  32     this.width  32     this.isDead  false     this.direction  0     this.deadCount  0     this.firing  false     this.moving  true     this.move  function            if this.isDead  false ampamp gameStart  true              context.clearRect0, 0, canvas1.width, canvas1.height             if this.x gt canvas.width  64                   this.y  10                 this.direction  0                          if this.x lt 0                  this.y  10                            if this.direction  1                  this.x  this.speed              else                  this.x  this.speed                            if this.x lt 0                  this.direction  1                           if this.y gt 420                  this.x  600                                  this.draw  function            context.drawImagesprite, 0, 480, 65, 68, this.x, this.y, 65, 65          this.reset  function           context.clearRectthis.x, this.y, 65, 65         this.x  20         this.y  20         this.health  100       var enemylist  []  function createEnemies      for var i  0 i lt 6 i          enemylist.pushnew hostile75  i, 20         function deleteEnemya      enemylist.splicea     enemyBulletList.splicea      enemylist.length   enemylist.length1     enemyBulletList.length  enemyBulletList.length  1   createEnemies  function moveEnemies      for var i  0 i lt enemylist.length i          if enemylist[i].isDead  false ampamp gameStart  true               if enemylist[i].x gt canvas.width  64                   enemylist[i].y  10                 enemylist[i].direction  0                          if enemylist[i].x lt 0                  enemylist[i].y  10                            if enemylist[i].direction  1                  enemylist[i].x  enemylist[i].speed              else                  enemylist[i].x  enemylist[i].speed                            if enemylist[i].x lt 0                  enemylist[i].direction  1                           if enemylist[i].y gt 420                  enemylist[i].x  600                             codepre  pSo to explain my problem, i can shoot and kill enemies from the array, this will also remove them from the screen. However if i shoot an enemy from the start of the array i cause all the enemies to cleared off the screen and the game to crash. If you need more information, feel free to ask.p  pBy request, i have submitted more code relating to my question. The code above includes the hostile function and other functions associated directly with it. p  pEDIT Vitim.us had offered a very useful tip regarding my question, he suggested to create a flag of some sort var dead  falsetrue etc. and once the value is changed the specific instance can simply be removed from the screen away from the player.p

The reason why you see other activities here is because Im trying to migrate my previous program which didnt run in the background into a service that runs in the background. So right now the only activity I use is Main Activity that has a toggle button, and the service class. p  precode    ltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt     ltmanifest

Negative 8952 pI am trying to convert an existing ASP.NET Web API project currently hosted in IIS into one that can use the SelfHost framework. Im a bit fuzzy on the actual details but understand I can run a selfhost server in a console window and then run the service on top of it. The problem Im having is that my project is an MVC project and not a console one. My familiarity with consoleWindows apps is somewhat limited as I generally work with projects to be hosted in IIS.p  pWhat Im a bit confused on is whether I need to convert my existing Web API project in Visual Studio into a new console application, or if theres a way to create another console application Project in the solution which can act as the web server for the Web API services, or rather if theres a way to add a console element with a Main entry point to the existing MVC project overriding the Global.asax entry point.p  pSearch didnt yield much information that helps me fill this knowledge gap. Hoping someone can point me in the right direction. Even at a high level.p

Negative 8952 h2The questionh2  pWhy cant I target a server using its IP address in the request URL and the hostname as the Host header using GoLang Why does the same thing work using python 2.7.6  urllib2p  h2Backgroundh2  pIm writing a systems test that will send HTTP requests to several specific application servers that Im testing and inspect the results for correctness. Each application server has the same function and should return the same response data. These servers are grouped behind load balancers. These load balancers are then resolved by DNS and the traffic is forwarded to the backend servers as appropriate. In order to target each server independently for the tests I am using each servers IP address in the URL instead of the usual hostname and Im setting the Host HTTP header to be the hostname that usually goes in the url. This is to make sure the SSL cert can decode the secure HTTPS request.p  h2Current statush2  pI already have a python script that sends these test requests. Heres the basic idea of that scriptp  precodeheaders  Host lthostnamegt  this lthostnamegt is usually what would go in the URL on the next line request  urllib2.Requesthttpsltipaddressgtpathquery123, headersheaders response  urllib2.urlopenrequest  etc...  codepre  pThis code has been working fine for several months now. Ive verified that it is indeed targeting the correct servers, based on IP address.p  h2Goalh2  pI want to replicate this script in golang to make use of the concurrent capabilities of go. The reason Im using go is that Id like to send lots more requests at a time using goroutines.p  h2Problemh2  pUsing the same technique as shown above but in Go I get the following errorp  precodeGet httpsltipaddressgtpathquery123 x509 cannot validate certificate for ltipaddressgt because it doesnt contain any IP SANs codepre  pHeres an example of the kind of code I have writtenp  precoderequest,   http.NewRequestGET, httpsltipaddressgtpathquery123, nil request.Header.SetHost, lthostnamegt  client  amphttp.Client response, err  client.Dorequest  etc... codepre  pAgain, why does the python code work while the GoLang code returns an errorp

Negative 8952 pIm trying to keep to SOLID object oriented programming principles, stay DRY, etc, but my newness to PythonSQLAlchemyPyramid is making it very hard.p  pIm trying to take what I now know to be a SQLAlchemy model used to create a simple Pyramid Framework object and use what I know to be reflection in C, it may be called something different in Python Introspection Not sure as this is only my second week with python but I have lots of experience in other languages CCC,Java, etc so the trouble seems to be mapping my knowledge to the vocabulary of python, sorry, to find out the field names of the database table, and most importantly, the current field values, when I do not know the column names or ANY of the shape of the object in advance.p  pThats right I dont know that the derp instance has a field named id or name, just that it has columns and a value in each of them. And thats all I care about.p  pThe goal is to be able to take any SQLAlchemy defined data model, and convert it to a dictionary of columnname  columnvalue fields of simple data types of the kind found in JSON as I want to ultimately serialize any object I create in SQLAlchemy to a json object, but I will settle for a dictionary as from there its trivial as long as the dictionary holds the correct types of data.  Doing this for every object by hand is a violation of too many good clean code rules and will create too much work over time I could spend another week on this and still save time and effort by doing it the right way.p  pSo if I have a class defined in SQLAlchemy asp  precodeclass SimpleFooModelBase     id  ColumnInteger, primarykeyTrue, autoincrementTrue, nullableFalse     name  ColumnVARCHARlength12, nullableFalse, indexTrue codepre  p.. and I have an instance of this equal to in pythonp  precodederp  SimpleFooModelid7, nameFoobar codepre  pI want to be able to having ONLY the derp instance variable described above, and NO OTHER KNOWLEDGE of how the model is shaped, and be able to flatten it out to a python keyvalue dictionary for that simple object, where every value in that dictionary can be serialized to JSON using import json from python syslib.p  pThe problem is , I have been up for 2 days looking at this and I cant find an answer that gives me the results I want in my unit tests ANYWHERE Google keeps taking me to really old posts here on SO about really old versions of the library that either use interfaces that no longer apply, or have accepted answers that do not actually work at all and since none of them are recent that does surprise me but why Stack Overflow keeps them when they are wrong and allows google to mislead people does surprise mep  pI know I could wire every object manually for every object to json, etc, but thats not only NOT ELEGANT, its inefficient because it just creates more work for me as I create more objects and could lead to big bugs down the road. I want to know how to do this the correct way, with introspectionreflection, but nobody seems to know, and the people who claim to have all given examples here on stack overflow that actually do not work at all at least with the current versions of thingsp  pThis seems like a really common use case for me and getting the column field list and then iterating through it with getattr  like many of the answers say to do  doesnt work as expected either it just creates what look like namespaces that never return the actual value of the column, and dont actually exist in any code as none of the fields created by sqlalchmy are singletonstatic.p  pSop  precode    from sqlalchemy.inspection import inspect      obj  inspectderp, raiseerrTrue      for key in obj.attrs.keys         fields[key]  getattrderp, key         print fields[key] codepre  pJust gives mep  precode    [Class Name].[Column Name] codepre  p.. or in this case just gives mep  precode    SimpleFooModel.id     SimpleFooModel.name codepre  pNOT the values of 7 and Foobar for id and name respectively, that I actually expected in my tests.p  pIn fact it seems like I cant even find WHERE the values are being stored in the object model or I could brute force the issue and get them from there as an ugly, evil hack I would be ashamed to look at.  All I get through the official public api is a lot of objects that seem to have no clue where the real data is being stored, but will happily tell me the name of the path used by the column name and type, restrictions, etc... just not the actual data that I want.p  pYet since my requirement is that I do not know the field names in advance, using a call to derp.id or derp.name to collect the value is not an option since that would violate SOLID and force me to duplicate work for every single class.  So its not an option.p  pMaybe its the fact I have not slept in 2 days but its really hard for me to not see this as a serious design flaw in these libs I just want to serialize a SQLAlchemy defined Model object representing a single row in a table into a python dictionary without having to know the names of the fields in advance, and while many other languages make this easy or even trivial, this seems to be far too hard than it should be.p  pCan somebody please explain either a working solution or why I am wrong to want to apply SOLID to my codep  pEDIT Updated spelling.p

Negative 8952 pI currently have a UISplitViewController. I have 5 rows in my master view controller and each of the row when tapped will place its respective detail view on screen. It basically works like some sort of menu.p  pThe way I coded it is in the didSelectRow method.p  pHeres a sample codep  precode voidtableViewUITableView tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath          if[indexPath row]  0                      firstviewcontroller  [self.storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifierfirstviewcontroller]              UINavigationController nvc  [[UINavigationController alloc] initWithRootViewControllerfirstviewcontroller]              NSArray vcs  [NSArray arrayWithObjects[self navigationController], nvc, nil]              [[self splitViewController] setViewControllersvcs]              [[self splitViewController] setDelegatefirstviewcontroller] codepre  pIts basically the same for the other 4 rows I have.p  pRight now, for example, if the first row is tapped, it displays the firstviewcontroller. And when the first row is tapped again, it will replace the current instance with a new instance.p  pHow do I prevent this Its really annoying when Im filling out the details in the firstviewcontroller such as textfields, etc and then I accidentally tap the first row, and it replaces the current instance and all the textfields are empty and need to be filled out again.p  pI also like to ask how to preserve the viewcontroller instance. For example, I have filled out the data needed in the firstviewcontroller, and then I tap the second row to show the secondviewcontroller. When I tap the first row again, I would like to have the instance of the firstviewcontroller that I already have finished filling the data in. kind of like how the Settings app worksp

Negative 8952 pIm writing a TCP client to connect, send messages to, and read responses from nodes on a busy network. I do not have access to code running on those nodes, so I have to sculpt the TCP messages I send out over the wire very carefully.p  pIve decided that Im going to gather a bunch of live TCP data off of the network and use that as the basis for testing my client  given these input parameters, make sure that the transmitted binary renders into the hex I expect to see.p  pAt this point Im about to either fire up Wireshark and figure out how to filter for the packets that Im sending or implement a really simple TCP server that waits for connections, spits the transmitted binary to disk maybe processed to hex and then test that Im sending what I expect to send neither of which feel like robust or professional solutions.p  pSo how would you recommend setting up a test harness for a TCP client to verify the right hex messages are coming outp

Negative 8952 pI have been working on a MVCEF application. We use DI container to inject dependencies into controllers, services, and repositories i.e across the UIServicesDataAccess layers.p  pMy question is regarding DI in services. One thing I have been confused about recently has been arisen from the need to use the behaviour aka methods that was implemented in one service in another service.p  pAs far as I know, one service should not take dependency upon another because that would finally be leading closer to circular dependency and hence causing issues for DI container down the line.p  pSo my question is, how should I work this out p  pShould I be implementing the needed behaviour in second service as part of its own methods or I can somehow reuse it from the already implemented first service p  pCan DI container help me in this regardp  pOr is it that the way out is to outsource behaviour implemented in services into a separate Business Logic Layer, so it is available to each of the services BTW, we currently do not have a separate BLL.p

Negative 8952 pstrongOriginal Questionstrongbr Is there a heuristic or algorithim to programatically find out how many threads i can open in order to obtain maximum throughput of a async operation such as writing on a socketp  pstrongFurther explained questionstrongbr Im assisting a algorithms professor in my college and he posted a assignment where the students are supossed to learn the basics about distributed computing, in his words Sockets... The assignment is to create a server that listens on a given port, receives a string, performs a simple operations on it i think its supposed to count its length and return Ok or Rejected... The server must be able to handle a minimum of 60k submitions per second... My job is to create a little app to simulate 60K clients...p  pIve managed to automate the distribution of servers and the clients across a university lab in order to test 10 servers at a time network infrastructure became the bottleneck, the problem here is A lab is homogeneous, 2 labs are not If not tunned correctly the client usually cant simulate 60k users and report back to me, especially when the lab is a older one, strongANDstrong i would like to provide the client to the students so they could test their own server more reliably... The ability to determine the optimal number of threads to spawn has now become vital PS FireandForget is not a option because the client also tests if the returned value is correct, e.g If i send Short sentence i know the result will be Rejected and i have to check it...p  pA class have 60 students... and theres the morning class and the night class, so each week there will be 120 servers to test because as the semester moves along the server part will have to do more stuff, the client no it will always only send a string and receive OkRejected... So theres enough work to be done in order to justify all this work im doing...p  pstrongEdit1strongbr   Changed from Console to a async operationbr   I dont want the maximum number of threads, i want the number that will provide maximum throughput I imagine that on a 6 core pc the number will be higher than on a 2 core pcp  pstrongEdit2strongbr    Im building a simple console app to perform some test in another app... one of thouse is a specific kind of load test RUDY attack where i have to simulate a lot of clients performing a specific attack... The thing is that theres a curve between throughput and number of threads, where after a given point, opening more threads actually decreases my throughput...p  pstrongEdit3strongbr Added more context to the initial question...p

Negative 8952 pI want to merge several PDF documents into one. The source documents can consist of PDFs created by me and others created by other organisations. I have no control over the permissions attached to documents not created by me. Some of these documents those not created by me may have permissions set. If a document requires a password to open it I do not attempt to merge it.p  pI am using iText 5.5.1 I think that is the latest to create a PDFCopy object to contain the resulting document and a reader for each source PDF in a loop I am passing a list of the documents to be merged. I check each document for the number of pages and then using the PDFCopy object import each page and then add it to the PDFCopy object the reason these two steps are separate is due to the intricacies of the language I am using to work with the java objects, RPG on an IBM iSeries. The problem is I can attach a reader to a PDF with permissions and get the page count, but as soon as I try to import a page into the copy object the program complains and terminates with the message PdfReader not opened with owner password. I am not able to get the persons providing the documents from other organisations to not protect the documents there a very, very good reasons why the original document is protected from change but I need to consolidate these documents into one.p  pMy question is, can I copy PDFs with permissions into a new document using iText and can I do it without knowing the owner password In addition to that I guess the other question would be, is it legalp  pThanks GarryMp
Negative 8952 pI have a PHP form which I created using a tabbed box. There are 3 tabs, each tab requires the user to enter values for a varied amount of fields. I then continued to add a border around the form headings, tabs and the form itself. The border appears fine but its width is the entire width of the page. Whereas, my form only takes up 50 of the width. I know how to change the width and all that, which I already did but the problem is if I change the width of the border, the width of the form is effected. At the moment I can change the width of the border to about 70 without effecting the form, but anymore than that and the form is ruined I am using CSS within the style tags of my HTML page as followsp  pThis CSS code is for the tabs themselves and also the tabbed area where the form is locatedp  precode.tabs  liststyle none  .tabs li  display inline  .tabs li a  color black float left display block padding 4px 10px marginleft 1px position relative left 1px background D8D8D8 textdecoration none  .tabs li ahover  background ccc   .groupafter  visibility hidden display block fontsize 0 content   clear both height 0   .boxwrap  position relative minheight 250px   .tabbedarea div div  background white padding 10px minheight 250px position absolute top 1px left 40px width 50 backgroundcolor D8D8D8  .tabbedarea div div, .tabs li a  border 1px solid 0000FF   boxonetarget, boxtwotarget, boxthreetarget    zindex 1  codepre  pThis is the CSS for the border if I change the width to anything lower than 1600px, the form is effectedp  precode.border      borderstyle solid     borderwidth medium     height 750px     backgroundcolor F2F2F2     width 1600px   codepre  pAny help would be greatly appreciated thanksp

Negative 8952 pI have been reading tons of articles on unit testing. I am specifically using angular.js right now and came to the conclusion that unit testing  great. I also understand what unit tests are conceptually, but I honestly have no idea what I am doing or looking for. I already started the angular application and before I continue, I feel like I should start testing units of it. I have started tutorials and everything tells me how to do it using jasmine or the other ones.  I have a node project set up that is running Karma and a folder that has some .js files in it to do all the describingtesting. However, it feels like the tests I write in a js sit in that file and do nothing. p  pWhat am I looking for How do I actually view the results of the tests It is all there, but I have no idea where exactly I am supposed to start. Am I supposed to be able to view the test in the browser Is it supposed to run and save to a log file Is it actually supposed to be tied to my ACTUAL code, or is it just rewritten logic that is supposed to mimic my code for testing p  pThis may be a dumb question, but I have spent a long time trying to figure out what exactly to look for. I noticed in some tutorials people have had little  windows that tell them if their tests are failing or not webstorm I believe while they are writing the tests. p  pAny guidance would be greatly appreciatedp

Negative 8952 pIn my application, one of the pages has a particularly heavyweight model, using ArrayLists of serializable objects. When Wicket attempts to serialize it, I get a stackOverflow exception. The page is part of a Wizard, so there is stateful information which must be saved.p  pI first tried to disable Wickets page serialisation, using a dummy page serialiser class as described a hrefhttpmaciejmiklas.blogspot.de201309wicket6disablepageserialization.html relnofollowhereap  pHowever this caused application wide problems, as many of our pages are stateful and their models need to be serialised.p  pUsing a loadabledetachable model for the problematic page isnt practical, as recreating the model data from the database is a very expensive operation and would cause noticeable delays every time the page needs to be recreated.p  pSo the question is, whats the best approach to solving the stack overflow problem, and retaining the stateful operation of the web page without using Wicket serialisationp  pA simplistic solution is just to increase the JVMs stack size, but this doesnt feel like it would scale well. And how big is big enoughp  pHere is the stack trace truncatedp  precode15Jul2014 095236 org.apache.catalina.core.StandardWrapperValve invoke SEVERE Servlet.service for servlet default threw exception

Negative 8952 pNoSQL databases like Couchbase do hold a lot of documents in memory, hence their enormous speed but its also putting a greater demand on the memory size of the servers its running on.p  pIm looking for the best strategy between several contrary strategies of storing documents in a NoSQL database. These arep  ul liOptimise for speedli ul  pPutting the whole information into one big document has the advantage that with a single GET the information can be retrieved from memory or from disk if it was purged from memory before. With the schemaless NoSQL databases this almost wished. But eventually the document will become too big and eat up a lot of memory, less documents will be able to be kept in memory in totalp  ul liOptimise for memoryli ul  pSplitting up all documents into several documents eg using compound keys as what is described in this question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions21181451designingrecordkeysfordocumentorienteddatabasebestpracticesDesigning record keys for documentoriented database  best practicea especially when those documents would only hold information that is necessary in a specific ReadUpdate operation would allow more transient documents to be held in memory.p  pThe use case Im looking at is Call Detail Records CDRs from Telecommunication Providers. These CDRs all go into hundreds of millions typically per day. Yet, many of these customer dont provide a single record on each given day Im looking at the SouthEast Asian market with its Prepaid dominance and still less data saturation. That would mean that typically a large number of documents are having a ReadUpdate maybe every other day, only a small percentage will have several ReadUpdate cycles per day.p  pOne solution that was suggested to me is to build 2 buckets, with more RAM being allocated to the more transient ones and less RAM being allocated to the second bucket holding the bigger documents. That would allow a faster access to the more transient data and more slower one to the bigger document which eg holds profileuser information that isnt changing at all. I do see two downsides to this proposal though, one is that you cant build a view MapReduce across two buckets this is specifically for Couchbase, other NoSQL solution might allow this and the second one would be more overhead in managing closely the balance between the memory allocation for both buckets as the user base growths.p  pHas anyone else being challenged by this and what was your solution to that problem What would be the best strategy from your POV and why Clearly it most be something in the middle of both strategies, having only one document or having one big document split up into hundreds of documents cant be the ideal solution IMO.p  pEDIT 2014914 Ok, though that comes close to answering my own question but in absence of any offered solution so far and following a comment here is a bit more background how I now plan to organise my data, trying to achieve a sweet spot between speed and memory consumptionp  pMobileNoProfilep  ul lithis holds profile information from a table, not directly from a CDR. Less transient data goes in here like age, gender and name. The key is a compound key consisting of the mobile number MSISDN and the word profile, separated by a li ul  pMobileNoRevenuep  ul lithis holds transient information like usage counters and variables accumulating the total revenue the customer spent. The key is again a compound key consisting of the mobile number MSISDN and the word revenue, separated by a li ul  pMobileNoOptinp  ul lithis holds semi transient information about when a customer opted into the program and when heshe opted out of the program again. This can happen several times and is handled via an array. The key is again a compound key consisting of the mobile number MSISDN and the word optin, separated by a li ul  pConnectionIdp  ul lithis holds information about a specific AB connection senderreceiver which was done via voice or video call or SMSMMS. The key is consisting of both mobilenos which are concatenated.li ul  pBefore these changes in the document structure I was putting all the profile, revenue and optin information in one big document, always keeping the connectionid as a separate document. This new document storing strategy gives me hopefully a better compromise between speed and memory consumption as I split the main document into several documents so that each of them has only the important information that is readupdated in a single step of the app.p  pThis also takes care of the different rate of changes over time with some data being very transient like the counters and the accumulative revenue field that gets updated with every CDR coming in and the profile information being mostly unchanged. I do hope this gives a better understanding of what Im trying to achieve, comments and feedback is more than welcome.p

Negative 8952 pInputs I have a theme xaml file where in all the data templates are defined for specific datatypes. Refer below, I have a data template of type Table consisting of grid. The data template is defined under resource dictionary. I have kept Grid empty and just given name as DynamicGrid.

Each block was independent of all others, except with respect to positioning. You could have as many blocks of any given type. A wireframe of the what Im talking about is shown below.

Negative 8952 pLet me start by apologizing I dont have much code to show. Heres the situation Im trying to run a periodic update in the background using an AsyncTask. This particular async task is NOT defined in an activity or anything but instead in its own class. I was wondering if there was a way for me to send a message from this task in the doInBackground method to somewhere else, for example, to a fragment somewhere else in the code really anywhere at this point. Ive looked into using .post and am currently trying to use a Handler to send and receive messages with no luck. Thanks in advancep
Negative 8952 pI am working with an API to update our product information. The API allows me to do a bulk item upload of 20 items per call. In order to update all 1000 items I have to loop through this script a number of times. This script basically compiles an XML of 20 items and uses curl to send it, then grabs the next 20 items creates XML and repeat. When I limit the outter loop to, say 15, it works fine and returns a success message for each API call. It fails at random times Ive had it send up to 40 API calls before failing and Ive also had it fail after 10 calls.p  pI cant find anything in the error logs as to why I am getting a 500 back. Ive reached out to the folks managing the API to see if they have any idea.p  pMy best guess is it has something to do with a timeout.p  precodequery  SELECT DISTINCT  id, link,  price,  shipgroup,

Negative 8952 pThe fontconfig library has a function codeFcFinicode. p  pThe a hrefhttpwww.freedesktop.orgsoftwarefontconfigfontconfigdevelfcfini.html relnofollowdocsa just sayp  blockquote   pFcFini [...]p      pFrees all data structures allocated by previous calls to   fontconfig functions. Fontconfig returns to an uninitialized state,   requiring a new call to one of the FcInit functions before any other   fontconfig function may be called.p blockquote  pHowever, the docs do not say emwhyem I might want to call it. It will free some memory, but I cannot imagine fontconfig will gobble up vast amounts of memory.

So why botherp  pIncidentally, I noticed that the a hrefhttpcairographics.org relnofollowcairoa rendering library, which uses fontconfig, only calls codeFcFinicode in its test code, but never in the production code.

No assumptions can be made about the order or type of characters in the URL so the path variables cant simply be separated with 2 hyphens.p

Negative 8952 pIn my Rails app Im using willpaginate and partials to make it so you can click through pages of a list without the page refreshing. This is the JS I use to call the partials and do it all p  precodefunction         .pagination a.onclick, function             .getthis.href, null, null, script           return false             codepre  pFor some reason, however, it works just fine when I click a link the first time replaces the partial with an updated one. However after that, I click the next pagination anchor link and the page does a full refresh. Any idea why My thinking is that this JS only executes when the DOM is initially loaded and so when the partial is replaced with one containing new links they arent wired up to this code. If this is correct, how would I go about fixing it p

Negative 8952 pI have written an efficient parallax script that is very smooth on mobile. However, it is only smooth if I am scrolling with my finger on the screen. When scrolling with my finger on the screen, the parallax is smooth. But the second I take my finger off and let the inertia take over, it starts lagging. But only when the inertia takes over. Im thinking if there is some kind of scroll event that is fired often during inertial scroll. It does not appear to be the script causing the lag, it is more to do with the fact that the scroll event or whatever scroll event Ive tried does not fire as often during inertial scrolling. Ive tested this theorem by measuring the amount of time that has passed from one scroll event to another. The result was that scroll events fire no less frequently when parallax is being calculated and applied versus an event where it is not.p  pEssentially, what Im asking for is an event that is fired just as many times during inertial scroll as when the finger is on the screen and dragging.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 8952 pConsider two hosts emAem and emBem on a wired network. Both the hosts send data packets to each other. In a real world scenario, the delays experienced in the direction emAememBem can be different from emBememAem. One primary reason could different routes in which packets are made to travel. For example, emAememBem might take longer time than emBememAem, possibly because it travels through a different set of routers or a longer route. Now lets assume that the packets from emAememBem and emBememAem take the same route for delivery. Can there still be potential causes for different delays between the packets in two directions If yes, it would be great if someone can elaborate.p

The cloned element passed into transcludeFn already has scope attached and has been compiled, so my function now parses the template text and generates individual textElements and moves the argument elements around to suit the template.p  blockquote   pstrongMy Current Solutionstrongp blockquote  precode.directiveTemplateReplace, [compile, document, timeout,   function compile, document, timeout        return            restrict AC,           transclude true,           link function scope, iElement, iAttrs, controller, transclude                transcludescope, function clone, scope                    timeoutfunction                          Our template is the first real child element nodeType 1                       var template  null                       for var i  0, ii  clone.length i lt ii i                            if clone[i].nodeType  1                                template  angular.elementclone[i]                               break                                                                           Remember the templates text, then transclude it and empty its contents                       var html  angular.copytemplate.text                       iElement.appendtemplate         Transcluding keeps external directives intact                       template.empty                  We can populate its inards from scratch                         Split the html into pieces seperated by [[tagname]] parts                       if html                            var htmlLen  html.length                            var textStart  0                           while textStart lt htmlLen                                var tagName  null,                                 tagEnd  htmlLen,                                 textEnd  htmlLen                                var tagStart  html.indexOf[[, textStart                               if tagStart gt 0                                    tagEnd  html.indexOf]], tagStart                                   if tagEnd gt 0                                        tagName  html.substrtagStart  3, tagEnd  tagStart  3                                       tagEnd  2                                       textEnd  tagStart                                                                                                   Text parts have to be created, compiled and appended                               var text  html.substrtextStart, textEnd  textStart                               if text.length                                    var textNode  document[0].createTextNodetext                                   template.appendcompiletextNodescope                                                                Tag parts are located in the clone then transclude appended to keep external directives intact note each tagNode can only be referenced once                               if tagName ampamp tagName.length                                    var tagNode  clone.filtertagName                                   if tagNode.length                                        template.appendtagNode                                                                                                 textStart  tagEnd                                                                     , 0                                     ] codepre

Negative 8952 pIve made a Swift SpriteKit application within Xcode 6 and that was locked to landscape. Ive attempted to change the device orientation to portrait and the screen itself changes orientation but the resolutions do not swap.p  pFor example, the iPhone 4s simulator is returning a resolution of 1024x768 in landscape, however when in portrait orientation, still returns the same dimensions. As such all graphics, fonts, etc are all skewed. I no longer need the application to support landscape view. p  pI have changed the deployment info of the app and the viewcontroller to reflect the desired portrait orientation.p

Negative 8952 pIve built a simple simulator using JBox2D, which involves a character built from a collection of bodies and four Revolute Joints.  Ive run into a problem I need to restore the pose of this character exactly, given a list of joint angles, joint velocities, and the torso positionrotationvelocityangular velocity.p  pThere are convenient getters and setters for the state of a body, but I cant find a good way to force the joint angles to where they need to be moving bodies in the process.  A couple solutions on this site recommends setting up a basic feedback system to try to get a joint motor to drive the joint to the desired angle, but this seems like it would be imprecise and possibly compute intensive.  Id ideally like to find a way to just set these values directly.  p  pAs a last resort, I could use forward kinematics to calculate all the translations and rotations myself, but maybe there is an easier way.p  pAny help appreciated.

Negative 8952 pI am trying to create simple database abstraction layer.

I am not sure why for example in ZF2 every time I have to use Table Data Gateway like DI in the models.p  pIn my case my AbstractModel just get DbAdapter in the constrictor by IoC container but I am not sure that this is ok. Ok I will describe my situation. I have following classesbrp  ul liDbAdapter  it creates db connection using PDObrli liIoC Inversion of Control Containerbrli liAbstractModel  in constructor I get DbAdapter using IoC. This means that it hold only one instance of DbAdapter. In this class I also have CRUD methods.brli liAnother classes represent the tables in db. For example class User extends AbstractModel and has method getTable which return the name of the table. Another sql queries will be in this classes which represent the tables. These classes have access to DbAdapter.brli ul  pIs it ok this scheme and how can I improve itp

Negative 8952 pI have a QML codeCanvascode that can be scaled more specifically it is a child of an object that is scaled, and scaling it causes its output to become aliased.  This is occurring because the codeCanvascode uses its size to determine the framebuffer size.p  pWhat I actually want to happen is for the framebuffer to track the codeCanvascode size multiplied by its scale i.e. its onscreen pixel size.p  pMy initial idea was to set the codecanvasWindowcode and codecanvasSizecode to the scaled size, but it seems that there is no decoupling between the codeCanvascode pixel size and the framebuffers because the whole image began to render beyond the bounds of the codeCanvascode.p  pIn this example the black ring in rendered inside a codeCanvascode that is parented to the scaled grey rectanglep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com64696.jpg altBefore img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comBEEIF.jpg altAfterp  precodeCanvas      id borderCanvas     anchors          fill parent         margins 4           antialiasing true     canvasWindow Qt.rect 0,0,                            width  parent.scale,                            height  parent.scale      canvasSize Qt.size width  parent.scale,                          height  parent.scale       onCanvasWindowChanged          requestPaint           onPaint          var ctx  getContext 2d          ctx.save         ctx.clearRect 0, 0, canvasWindow.width, canvasWindow.height           ctx.strokeStyle  Syapplicationqml.paletteObject.buttonText         ctx.lineWidth  4  parent.scale          ctx.beginPath         ctx.arc canvasWindow.width  2,                  canvasWindow.height  2,                   canvasWindow.width  2   ctx.lineWidth,                  0,                  Math.PI  2          ctx.stroke          ctx.restore       codepre  pSo is there anyway to set the codeCanvascode framebuffer size such that scaling transformations do not affect itp  h2Edith2  pIf I leave codecanvasWindowcode at the default, and just update the codecanvasSizecode then I dont get the framebuffer rendering beyond the codeCanvascode bounds  but the output is still at a low resolution so codecanvasSizecode still isnt actually changing the size of the framebuffer...p

We only need one of the input fields to have a value. When the form is submitted another directive is run cf. the numbervalidation above. This simply checks if any of the model values have something greater than zero entered. If so it validates the control in question. However if the user uses a touch screen and increments the value for one of the fields further down the page, every input field up to the field with the value is seen as invalid. This is because until it actually gets to the field with the value the model value doesnt appear to be set. I dumped the model array form.numberArray to the console in the validation directive and could see that each value was being appended each time the validation directive was run.p  pWhat I need is to have the model update when the button is touched. I tried using scope.parent.apply but simply got an in progress error.p  pAny suggestions, guidance or recommendations gratefully received. p
Negative 8952 pI found an issue with possibly codeNSURLCachecode today while inspecting request and response headers in Charles Proxy. The issue is a little perplexing, but Im able to repro it consistentlyp  pIn a nutshell, the issue has to do with caching of codeNSURLRequestcodes using iOSs native codeNSURLCachecode with the default policy. It turns out that the request is not cached whenever the response has the header codetransferencoding chunkedcode. But if the response header is codecontentlength xxxcode instead, caching works fine. Specifically, it seems that when the response is chunked, NSURLCache doesnt save the eTag and also neglects appending the codeifnonematchcode header to subsequent requests to the same url, and consequently, caching fails as it should, i.e. a 200 is returned instead of a 304. p  pIm testing on the iOS8.2 simulator. Even if you dont have a solution, Id love to hear if youve experienced the same issue. Ive found at least a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions20248707nsurlcacheinconsistentbehaviouranswer26789163one similar reporta, and heres a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions29112728whendoesrailsrespondwithtransferencodingvscontentlengthrelated thread posted by my backend engineera.p

Negative 8952 pI am trying to implement a blocking queueonly on consumer side with ReentrantLock and conditions but am running into a state where the JVM doesnt terminate. The strange thing is that one thread gets interrupted but the other doesnt. I am sure I am making some mistake but just cant figure out what.p  pEDIT p  pMain Question Why does only one thread throw an interruptedexception when both the threads are blocking on condition.awaitp  pSo the code below is just an example that i created. The main problem was to develop a producerconsumer implementation in which I had to create a simulation class which spawned two kinds of threads, customers and cooks, which were synchronized based on a Reentrant lock. After some operations were performedcustomers adding orders and cooks performing serving those orders,I call join on customer threads to make sure that all orders have been processed and then to stop the cook threads, I called interrupt on the cook threads to terminate them. But only one thread throws interruptedexception and the second one doesnt. Why is that since both the threads are blocking on await.p  pMy code is as followsp  pThread classp  precodepublic class InterruptedThread implements Runnable      private final Lock lock     private final Condition condition     private final QueueltIntegergt orderQueue       public InterruptedThreadLock lock, Condition condition,QueueltIntegergt orderQueue              this.lock  lock         this.condition  condition         this.orderQueue  orderQueue           Override     public void run           try         whiletrue                      this.lock.lockInterruptibly             whileorderQueue.size  0 ampamp Thread.currentThread.isInterrupted                                 System.out.printlnInside blocking wait  Thread.currentThread.getName                    condition.await                           int i  orderQueue.poll.intValue             System.out.printlnValue read  i  by thread  Thread.currentThread.getName             this.lock.unlock                             catchInterruptedException ex                      System.out.printlnInterrupted exception  Thread.currentThread.getName             this.condition.signalAll             Thread.currentThread.interrupt                   codepre  pMain classp  precodepublic class ExplicitLockCondition              param args the command line arguments           public static void mainString[] args           TODO code application logic here          QueueltIntegergt orderQueue  new LinkedListltgt         Lock lock  new ReentrantLock         Condition testCondition  lock.newCondition          Thread[] ths  new Thread[2]         forint i0 iltths.lengthi                      ths[i]  new Threadnew InterruptedThreadlock, testCondition,orderQueue             ths[i].start                   lock.lock          orderQueue.add1         lock.unlock          lock.lock         orderQueue.add2         lock.unlock          try              Thread.currentThread.sleep5000          catch InterruptedException ex              Logger.getLoggerExplicitLockCondition.class.getName.logLevel.SEVERE, null, ex                   lock.lock         orderQueue.add99         lock.unlock           forint i0 iltths.lengthi                      ths[i].interrupt                   System.out.printlnAfter loop exited         forint i0 iltths.lengthi                  System.out.printlnInterrupted thread  ths[i].getName with interrupt flag  ths[0].isInterrupted                   forint i0 iltths.lengthi                      try                  ths[i].join              catch InterruptedException ex                  Logger.getLoggerExplicitLockCondition.class.getName.logLevel.SEVERE, null, ex                                System.out.printlnProgram exited         codepre

Negative 8952 pIve been using MongoDB with Mongoose and am creating a paginated API that returns items with in a certain distance of the user and returns the calculated distance.p  pInitially, I started by using the geoNear query which returns the distances as well as the object, but that does not work with the skip option, which I require to create the pagination.p  pI have recreated that query using nearSphere and am returning the same results, but the nearSphere does not return the distance like the geoNear query does. Because of this, I am looking to find what formula MongoDB uses to calculate the distance between two points, so I can calculate the distance myself.p  pThanksp

Android should know how to display the checkmarks.p  h1Codeh1  h2XMLh2  precodeltmenu     xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid     xmlnstoolshttpschemas.android.comtools     xmlnsapphttpschemas.android.comapkresauto     toolscontext.Calculatorgt     ltgroup         androidcheckableBehaviorsingle         androidvisibletruegt         ltitem             androidididuisimple             androidorderInCategory100             appshowAsActionifRoomwithText             androidtitleRegular             androidcheckabletruegt         ltitem             androidididuidoge             androidorderInCategory100             appshowAsActionifRoomwithText             androidtitleDoge             androidcheckabletruegt         ltitem             androidididuistatic             androidorderInCategory100             appshowAsActionifRoomwithText             androidtitleStatic             androidcheckabletruegt     ltgroupgt      ltitem androidtitleDisplay Mode         androidorderInCategory101 gt         ltmenugt             ltgroup androidcheckableBehaviorsingle androidvisibletrue   gt                 ltitem                     androidididmodesign                     androidorderInCategory100                     appshowAsActioncollapseActionView                     androidtitleSign Form                     androidcheckabletruegt                 ltitem                     androidididmodenoun                     androidorderInCategory100                     appshowAsActioncollapseActionView                     androidtitleNoun Form                     androidcheckabletruegt                 ltitem                     androidididmodeverb                     androidorderInCategory100                     appshowAsActioncollapseActionView                     androidtitleVerb Form                     androidcheckabletruegt             ltgroupgt          ltmenugt     ltitemgt  ltmenugt codepre  h2UIh2  pNote I have tried switching all the codebreakcodes to codereturn truecode, but nothing happens.p  precodeOverride public boolean onOptionsItemSelectedMenuItem item        Handle action bar item clicks here.

Negative 8952 pI have to write a program which sends files from a UDP client to a UDP server.p  pI have no problems sending data over this kind of connection, but a different matter is taking care of our protocol specification.

It composes a picture step by step, using geometric primitives such as line segments or arcs of small angle. As it goes, it looks for open areas to fill in with more detail as the available open areas get smaller, the detail gets finer, so its loosely fractal.p  pAt a given step, in order to decide what to do next, we want to find out where is the largest circular area thats still free of existing geometric primitivesp  h1Some constraints of the problemh1  ul liIt does not need to be exact. A closeenough answer is fine.li liImprecision should err on the conservative side an almostmaximal circle is acceptable, but a circle thats not quite empty isnt acceptable.li liCPU efficiency is a priority, because it will be called often.li liThe program will run in a browser, so memory efficiency is a priority too.li liIll have to set a limit on level of detail, constrained presumably by memory space.li liWe can keep track of the primitives already drawn in any way desired, e.g. a spatial index. Exactness of these is not required e.g. storing bounding boxes instead of arcs would be OK. However the more precision we have, the better, because it will allow the program to draw to a higher level of detail.

On 64bit Linux, this seems to be working without any issues, but strangely enough, on 64bit Windows, nothing ever ends up being erased or redrawn. For example, if the screen is resized, the pencil markings do not resize as well, they just end up being cut out of the screen. When new marks are added in other words, when the paint listener is called again, the repositioned markings are redrawn on top of the old ones which didnt scale with the window. In other words, I believe the canvas is not being cleared upon canvas.redraw. Is there a workaround for thisp

Negative 8952 pIm looking to spin up a Kubernetes cluster on AWS that will access resources e.g. RDS, ElastiCache that are not on a VPC.p  pI was able to set up access to RDS by enabling ClassicLink on the kubernetesvpc VPC, but this required commenting out the creation of one of Kubernetes route tables which conflicted with ClassicLinks route tables, which breaks some of Kubernetes networking. ElastiCache is more difficult, as it looks like its access is only grantable via classic EC2 security groups, which cant be associated with a VPC EC2 instance, AFAICT.p  pIs there a way to do this Id prefer not to use a NAT instance to provide access to ElastiCache.p

Negative 8952 pIm presently looking at a situation where transitive dependency resolution would seem to work just fine with maven, but fails with sbt.p  pIt seems to be related, though not quite the same as a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions20912369sbtfailstoresolvedependencyforjerseycontainergrizzly2http251SBT fails to resolve dependency for jerseycontainergrizzly2http 2.5.1a.p  pIt seem similar, though not quite the same as a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions20341505sbtmanageddependencyretreivingwrongversionsbt Managed Dependency Retreiving Wrong Versiona. Furthermore, while the answer presented therein would seem to be a viable workaround, I believe there exists a deeper problem with how sbt resolves a particular class of dependencies and their versions. There would seem to be a structural incompatibility between sbt and mvn, and I would appreciate help with exploring it, and perhaps finding a satisfying solution.p  pMy situation is as followsp  ol liA while ago, I built a javamaven project X,li liI then built a simple lift webapp on top of that i.e. depending on Xli liAll of this was fine and dandy, until I introduced a transitive dependency from X to jerseyclient2.8 by way of quandl4j1.2. Since then, while X continues to build and install happily, the lift sbt build fails with an unresolved dependency.li ol  pThe error message is as followsp  precode[warn]   fileUsersvincent.m2repositoryorgglassfishhk2hk2utils2.8hk2utils2.8.pom [info] Resolving org.glassfish.hk2hk2locator2.8 ...

Instead, I depend on version 2.8 of jerseyclient, which in turn visual inspection of the dependency hierarchy in eclipse, or resolving things through maven depends on hk2utils2.2.0.p  pThe corresponding dependency in the jerseyclient pom looks as followsp  precodeltdependencygt     ltgroupIdgtorg.glassfish.hk2ltgroupIdgt     ltartifactIdgthk2apiltartifactIdgt ltdependencygt codepre  pNote the absence of an explicit version number.

Negative 8952 pI have written a VBA plugin for Excel, which provides loginlogout functionality to a server. p  pThe way I have implemented it is to send a request to a URL on the server, which checks if the user has a session, if it does not, the server sends a 401 on the header response unauthorised.  The 401 response makes Excel automatically pop up the windows style login modal this comes for free with Excel I guess.  I enter my credentials, and the server authenticates the user, and a session is created.p  pMy problem is now when I try to logout.  The server destroys the session as expected.  If the user now clicks login again, Excel sends a HEAD request to the server, the server responds with a 401, and Excel then automatically sends the same username and password credentials that were entered by the user before.  The user is now logged on again.  Just to be clear  this is NOT server side caching, this is Excel resending login credentials, using Basic Authentication in the HTTP Header, after receiving a 401 response.p  pThis is not the expected behaviour, I would not like Excel to store a copy of the credentials, and reuse them time after time.  If the user logs out, I would like this to be permanent, until they decide to log in again at which time they should reenter their credentials.p  pThe problem I have is telling ExcelWindowsVBA to clear whatever it is keeping, wherever it is keeping it.  My problem is, I dont really know what the choreography is on the ExcelVBA side, its functionality that just seemed to come for free, so I do not know where this is stored.p  pFor what its worth, here is my VBAp  precode Dim req As MSXML2.XMLHTTP60  Set req  New MSXML2.XMLHTTP60  req.Open GET, url, False  req.send codepre

Negative 8952 pI am currently learning how to use database in Android. For one of my app, I need to stock 500 string values in order to read them. Actually to fill my database, I read a .txt file at the database creation with all the string values inside. For each lines of .txt corresponding to a string value, I create a new data in the database. The thing is I know that accessing a file can be long it is not a very good thing if there are thousands of values. According to that, I have two questions p  ul lipIs it really usefull to create a database  because I can directly access the string values by reading the .txtpli lipIs there a better way to fill the database  Or a way to create a database already filled before the activity creation  because currently, each time you close the activity you close the database and each time you reopen it, it recreate and refill the database.pli ul

Negative 8952 h2Symptomsh2  pAfter completing a VBA macro that runs whenever a calculation event occurs, my workbook enters a strange semilock state. The symptoms arep  ol liWhen highlighting any cell with contents, the formula bar or window flickers several times per second.li liI can enter formulas and formula arrays in any blank cell and calculation proceeds as normal, although flickering continues.li liSwitching between automanual calculate has no effect on the flickering.li liThe array formulas associated with the calculation event take on a strange property  While editing them in the formula bar, if I press codeENTERcode nothing happens.  Normally for an array formula I would get an error, but for these, the cursor just stays in the formula editing window unless I press codeCTRLSHIFTENTERcode.   See below for relevant details on the application.li ol  h2For contexth2  pMy application is a VBA addin that uses UDFs to pull readonly data from a remote MySQL server.  The workflow involves piggybacking on the calculate event in order to get around the fact that excel UDFs cant alter the size of the formula that is calling them.  The process goesp  ol liuser enters formulali liformula creates a query item that is stored in a global collectionli liupon calculation, a subroutine processes all the queries, sends SQL queries to the remote database, receives the response, resizes the formula region to fit the size of the returned data, and stores the returned data in another global collectionli liwhen the calling region is resized, the formula function automatically runs again.  This time, it sees that data is waiting in the second global collection and that the data is the right size, and it writes the data to the worksheet, preserving the formulali ol  pBased on the debug window, it looks like my calculate event has finished when the flickering begins to occur.  All of my global collections are empty.  Im not sure what the application is doing when it locks in this way or how to get more data on the problem.  It only occurs occasionally.p  pHas anyone encountered something like this beforep

Negative 8952 pnew user so Im sorry if this explanation isnt clear enough...I am having trouble creating timespec variables to be modifiedused between multiple source files. My program is meant to determine the time it takes to execute another program from within my initial program and therefore Ill need to clock the time in two source files and store it to be used later to determine the difference in time. I have been scouring the internet and tried different things but it always seems like my source files create different instances of the variables p  pHeres what my code basically looks likep  pHeader filep  precodeshared.h ifndef sharedh define sharedh includelttime.hgt  extern struct timespec callTime, startTime  endif codepre  pSource File1p  precodeshared.c include shared.h  struct timespec startTime  0, callTime  0 codepre  pSource File2p  precodeapp.c include shared.h include lttime.hgt  void main clockgettimeCLOCKMONOTONIC, ampstartTime end of main codepre  pSource Filep  precodetimer.c include shared.h include lttime.hgt  void main  pidt pid  fork  clockgettimeCLOCK MONOTONIC, ampcallTime ifpid  0     execvp.app, NULL     return 0 end of if  printfCall ld amp Start ldn, callTime.tvsec, startTime.tvsec  return 0 end of main codepre  pI will get something like...p  blockquote   pCall 14928304940 amp Start 0p blockquote  pHopefully this code gets the point across of what Im trying to do. When it forks and executes the other program, the value for startTime will change but wont hold so that when I call it later in the Parent process. The value will just be its initial value instead of the clocked time.  it seems Any thoughts on the matter would be greatly appreciatep  pAdded Note I do link shared.c with timer.c and app.c seperately and then run timer.cp  precodegcc shared.h gcc c shared.c gcc c app.c gcc c timer.c gcc o app app.o shared.o gcc timer.o shared.o .a.out codepre

Negative 8952 pI have a big issue with BackgroundMediaPlayer on Windows 10 mobile but I think that is very similar as API on Windows Phone 8.1. My app works similar as windows 10 sample. But I decided to add small user interface on mainpage where user can easily stop actual music. Problem is that when I am trying access BackgroundMediaPlayer.Current with events my music player dont play any music but when I delete events from main page It start works again. I manage my music player from other page. Is some way how to find out if my BackgroundMediaPlayer actualy playing some music with name of music  Because I do not know how to continue with my project...

Negative 8952 pI have an application that consists of a serverside REST API written in PHP, and some clientside Javascript that consumes this API and uses the JSON it produces to render a page.

So, for example, it might fetch something likep  precode     message ltscriptgtalertGotchaltscriptgt  codepre  pObviously, if my clientside code were to render this directly into the pages DOM, Ive created an XSS vulnerability.  So, this content needs to be HTMLescaped first.p  pThe question is, when strongoutputtingstrong untrusted content, should I escape the content on the server side, or the client side  I.e., should my API return the raw content, and then make it the client Javascript codes responsibility to escape the special characters, or should my API return safe contentp  precode     message ampltscriptampgtalertamp039Gotchaamp039ampltscriptampgt  codepre  pthat has been already escapedp  pOn one hand, it seems to be that the client should not have to worry about unsafe data from my server.
