Positive 5350 pI built the Android source code 5.1.1, and ran code.externalqemuobjsemulator64x86code to get my virtual Android device. I want to enable the virtual soft key, include codeHOMEcode, codeBACKcode, but I cant find codeqemu.hw.mainkeys0code or codero.show.navigationbaryescode in codesystembuild.propcode. Is that a problem of Android image that I built or the emulators setting Or what can I do with android source code to get an Android image with virtual soft keyp

Positive 5350 pI am writing a piece of code to iterate through a graph, find the degree of a nodevertex how many edges it has connected to it and then record this node in a dictionary so that I can later look up which nodes have a degree of, say, 2. My code for this is as followsp  precodeg  graphtool.loadgraphgraph.xml, fmtauto  kinhistmems   kouthistmems    for v in g.vertices     kin  v.indegree     kout  v.outdegree     kinhistmems[kin].appendg.vertexindex[v]     kouthistmems[kout].appendg.vertexindex[v] codepre  pThis obviously throws an exception because the lists in the dictionaries are not initialised yet. If I want to be crude I could instead sayp  precodeg  graphtool.loadgraphgraph.xml, fmtauto  kinhistmems   kouthistmems    for v in g.vertices     kin  v.indegree     kout  v.outdegree     if kinhistmems[kin] in kinhistmems         kinhistmems[kin].appendg.vertexindex[v]     else         kinhistmems[kin]  [g.vertexindex[v]] codepre  pSeeing as I will have far more vertices in my graph than keys in my dictionary I am probably adding unnecessary overhead by evaluating the codeifcode condition each time. Is there a better way of doing thisp

Positive 5350 pIm working on trying to create a key for a heatmap, but as far as I know, I cannot use the existing tools for adding a legend since Ive generated the colors myself I manually turn a scaled variable into rgb values for a short rainbow  [255,0,0] to [0,0,255] .p  pBasically, all I want to do is use the rightmost 10th of the screen to create a rectangle with these 10 colors 0000FF, 0072FF, 00E3FF, 00FFAA, 00FF38, 39FF00, AAFF00, FFE200, FF7100, FF0000p  pwith three numerical labels  at 0, max2, and max p  pIn essence, I want to manually produce an object that looks like a rudimentary heatmap color key.p  pAs far as I know, split.screen can only split the screen in half, which isnt what Im looking for. I want the graphic I already know how to produce to take up the leftmost 90 of the screen, and I want this colored rectangle to take up the other 10. p  pThanks.p  pEDIT I greatly appreciate the advice about the best way to the the plot  that said, I still would like to know the best way to do the task originally asked  creating the legend by hand I already am able to produce the exact heatmap graphic that Im looking for  the false coloring wasnt the only problem with ggplot that I was having  it was just the final factor convincing me to switch. I need a non ggplot solution.p  pEDIT 2 This is close to the solution I am looking for, except this only goes up to 10 instead of accepting a maximum value as a parameter I will be running this code on multiple datasets, all with different maximum values  I want the legend to reflect this. Additionally, if I change the size of the graph, the key falls apart into disconnected squares. p

Negative 5350 pI am about to start a project using ASP.NET MVC. As part of the project, we need to display some data to the user. The data consists of an object graph that consists of 35 days per line. Each day can be a work day or off day. If it is a work day, there could be additional information associated with the work day. So basically, we have an html table with 35 columns and 4 rows for each of the lines object graphs mentioned above. There can be up to approx 300 of these object graphs per user. p  pThe data inside these object graphs never change. For obvious performance reasons, we are only displaying 20 lines per page with an ajax call to retrieve successive pages on users request. So we have 20 of the above mentioned tables per page request.p  pFor performance reasons, we can generate the html for each of the above mentioned tables off line and we want to put them in a database or deploy to the web servers directory. My question is what is the performance implications for having the html in a database table and having a controller send the html back to the client on an ajax call vs. having the html fragments on a known location in the web server and client request the fragments via a http get request Is it even possible for an ajax request to retrieve  a file from the web server and change the inner html of some DOM object p  pThanks in advance for your answers.p

This could be done with simple defines, like sop  precodedefine HASNETWORK ... while 1    inputprocess ifdef HASNETWORK   networkprocess endif   graphicsprocess  codepre  pAs you can see this is alright for 1 or maybe only a few components, but if I want to do this for all of these input, network and graphics and additional components in the future, I would have to put separate ifdefs in there for each of them, and thats quite tedious.p  pIn pseudo code, what Im trying to accomplish is the followingp  precodecomponents  input, network, graphics ... foreach component in components   execute componentprocess codepre  pThis way components could easily be added in the future. I dont really mind if the checking is done compile time or run time although I obviously prefer compile time, but I can imagine run time is easier to implement. I have no idea how to even start.p

Negative 5350 pOk, so Im trying to build a website in which a large picture is the background. I want to be able to load a different size picture based on the users window size so they hopefully dont see any blank space. I want to use JavaScript to measure the size of the current screen. Then, based on the size of the window, I would like to load in an image that corresponds to that resolution.p  pHowever, when looking online, I could not find a standard way to get the window size in all browsers. Any help is very appreciated Also, if you have another idea of how to implement this, let me knowp

Negative 5350 pI want to redirect all queries to mydomain.com to mydomain.comlive.  Im already able to do that, however I have trouble with the URL displayed in the browser.  I have two goals, 1 that the URL always renders with www in front and 2 that the sub folder live is not displayed in the url.p  pEDIT Based on edited code by Cryo the following accomplishes my goals and also adds a trailing slash after all subfolders so that when a folder is typed in the url its correctly forwarded to the index.html inside of itp  precodeRewriteCond HTTPHOST www.domain.com RewriteRule . httpwww.domain.com1 [R301,L] RewriteRule  index.html  RewriteBase  RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME f RewriteCond REQUESTURI .. RewriteCond REQUESTURI . RewriteRule . httpwww.domain.com1 [L,R301]  RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME f RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME d RewriteCond REQUESTURI live RewriteRule . live1 codepre  pQuestion though, when adding a trailing slash to subfolders, I assumed RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME f would make it so that a slash isnt added after file names only folders so subfolderpage.html would not have a trailing slash which is what I want.  However RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME f seems to do nothing and RewriteCond REQUESTURI .. is needed.p
Negative 5350 pTypically the using declaration is used to bring into scope some member functions of base classes that would otherwise be hidden. From that point of view it is only a mechanism for making accessible information more convenient to use.br However the using declaration can also be used to change access constraints not only for functions but also for attributes. For example  p  precodeclass C public   int a   void g cout ltlt Cgn    C  a0   class D  public C private   using Ca   using Cg public   D  a  1    int mainvoid   D d   cout ltlt d.a ltlt endl  error a is inaccessible   C cp  ampd   cout ltlt cpgta ltlt endl works   d.g  error g is inaccessible   cpgtg  works   return 0  codepre  pI think this limitation of access in the derived class is actually of no use, because you can always access g and a from a pointer to the base class. So shouldt there be at least some kind of compiler warning Or wouldnt it been even better to forbid such limitation of access by a derived class The using declaration is not the only possibility to add constraints to access. It could also be done via overriding a base class function an placing it in a section with more access constraints. Are there some reasonable examples where it is indeed nessecary to limit access in such a way If not I dont see why it should be allowed.  p  pAnd another thing at least with g the same code compiles well without the word using. That means for the example above its possible to write Ca and Cg instead of using Ca using Cg Is the first only a shortcut for the latter or are there some subtle differences  p  pEDITbr so from the discussion and answers below my conclusion would bebr  its allowed to limit access constraints in derived classes with public inheritancebr  there are useful examples where it could be usedbr  its use might cause problem in combination with templates e.g. a derived class could not be a valid parameter for some template classfunction any more although its base isbr  a cleaner language design should not allow such usebr  compiler could at least issue some kind of warningp

Negative 5350 pOur application is a C server this problem is for the Windows port of said server that communicates with a Windows Java client.  In this particular instance we are sending data to the client, particularly, the message consists of a 7 byte header where the first 3 bytes all have a specific meaning op type, flags, etc and the last 4 bytes contain the size of the rest of the message.  For some reason I absolutely cant figure out, the third byte in the header is somehow changing if I put a break point on the codesendcode I can see that the third byte is what Im expecting code0xfecode, but when I check in the client, that byte is set to 0.  Every other byte is fine.  A did some traffic capturing with WireShark and saw that the byte was 0 leaving the server, which I find even more baffling.  The third byte is set via a define, alap  precodedefine GETTOPFRAME   0xfe codepre  pSome testing I did that further confuses the issuep  ol liI changed the value from using the define to first code0x64code, code0xffcode, code0xfdcode all came across to the client.li liI changed the value from using the define to using code0xfecode itself the value was zero at the client.li liI changed the value of the define itself from code0xfecode to code0xefcode the value was zero at the client.li ol  pNothing about this makes a lick of sense.

If it is, then instead of yielding the first value, I should raise this StopIteration. But somehow I should also remember the 2nd value that I asked if it wasnt StopIteration.p  pI dont know how to write it myself.

Negative 5350 pIm fairly new to C, but my understanding is that a include statement will essentially just dump the contents of the included file into the location of that statement. This means that if I have a number of include and using statements in my header file, my implementation file can just include the header file, and the compiler wont mind if I dont repeat the other statements.p  pWhat about people thoughp  pMy main concern is that if I dont repeat the include, using, and also typedef now that I think of it statements, it takes that information away from the file in which its used, which could lead to confusion.p  pI am just working on small projects at the moment where it wont really cause any issues, but I can imagine that in larger projects with more people working on them it could become a significant issue.p  pAn example followsp  pstrongUPDATEstrong my function prototypes for Unit have string, ostream and StringSet among their return types and parameters  I am not including anything in my header file that is used only in the implementation file.p  precodeUnit.h  include ltstringgt include ltostreamgt include StringSet.h  using stdstring using stdostream  class Unit   public     public members with string, ostream and StringSet     in their return valuesparameter lists private     private members     unrelated sidequestion should private members     even be included in the header file     Unit.cpp  include Unit.h  The following are all redundant from a compiler perspective include ltstringgt include ltostreamgt include StringSet.h  using stdstring using stdostream  implementation goes here codepre
Negative 5350 pA few years ago, TortoiseSVN 1.4.3 was deployed to our software development team and we are now looking at upgrading the client to the latest 1.6.x version.  I had hoped this upgrade would be transparent with the additional features and modifications being clientside.  For the most part, this was true emexceptem for a very important feature  merging.  When I try to merge a feature branch back into truck I get a showstopping Merge tracking not supported error.p  pHere are some facts worth notingp  ol lipWhen the repository was first created before I was on board, it was created via the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiTortoiseSVN relnofollowTortoiseSVNa client itself. We do not have an SVN server daemon per se, rather the repository foldersdatabase resides on a share folder that is accessible from our workstation machines via file. This was actually an eyeopener for me I had always thought there was some SVN server daemon we were talking to.pli lipWe do not have any access to the underlying machine hosting the SVN share other than the ability to readwrite to the share itself. I dont even know what OS the machine is running on. This share server was chosen because its drives are backed up nightly by our IT group.pli lipIn all honesty, we really dont emneedem the merge tracking feature although it would be nice to have. For the time being, it would be sufficient to be able to use a 1.6.x TortoiseSVN client on the 1.4.3 repository and have it merge sans tracking without error.pli ol  pHow does one upgrade a clientcreated 1.4.3 repository to a 1.6.x compatible version without access to the underlying machine the repository resides onp  pI was hoping the TortoiseSVN client itself had the ability to do this, but that does not appear to be the case.p  pWill I be forced to copy the entire repositoryover to my local drive, run some SVN commands to upgrade the repository locally and then copy the repository back to the share point  If so, will doing this break any compatibility with the 1.4.3 clients in case we cant upgrade them all at the same timep  pstrongNOTEstrongbr The question has been completely reworded in light of some of the answers given.p
Negative 5350 pFirst, I am aware that dynamic languages is a term used mainly by a vendor I am using it just to have a container word to include languages like Perl a favorite of mine, Python, Tcl, Ruby, PHP and so on. They are interpreted but I am interested here to refer to languages featuring strong capability to support the programmer efficiency and the support for typical constructs of modern interpreted languagesp  pMy question is there are dynamic languages can be compiled efficiently in native executable code  typically for Windows platforms Which ones Maybe using some third part adhoc tools I am not talking about huge executables carrying with them a full interpreter or some similar tricks nor some smart module able to include its own dependances or some required modules, but a honest, straight, standard, solid executable code.p  pIf not, there is some technical reason inhibiting the availability of such a bestofbothworld featurep  pThanksp  pDanielp

Negative 5350 pI have a file that contains the followingp  precodeinclude ltmapgt  class A   void doSomething     stdmapltint, Agt m  codepre  pWhen compiled into a shared library with g, the library contains dynamic symbols for all the methods of codestdmapltint, Agtcode.  Since codeAcode is private to this file, there is no possibility that codestdmapcode will be instantiated in any other shared library with the same parameters, so Id like to make the template instantiation hidden for some of the reasons described in a hrefhttppeople.redhat.comdrepperdsohowto.pdfthis documenta.p  pI thought I should be able to do this by adding an explicit instantiation of the template class and marking it as hidden, like sop  precodeinclude ltmapgt  class A  template class attributevisibility hidden stdmapltint, Agt  void doSomething     stdmapltint, Agt m  codepre  pHowever, this has no effect the symbols are still all exported.  I also tried surrounding the entire file withp  precodepragma GCC visibility pushhidden ... pragma GCC visibility pop codepre  pbut this also has no effect on the visibility of the methods of codestdmapltint, Agtcode although it does hide codedoSomethingcode.  Similarly, compiling with codefvisibilityhiddencode has no effect on the visibility of the methods of codestdmapltint, Agtcode.p  pThe document I linked to above describes the use of export maps to restrict visibility, but that seems very tedious.p  pIs there a way to do what I want in g other than using export maps  If so, what is it  If not, is there a good reason why these symbols must always be exported, or is this just a omission in gp

Negative 5350 pI have seen many examples in various programming languages that are using the DouglasPeucker polyline simplification algorithm to produce a GPolyline to be used on Google Maps. The algorithm, when expressed for polylines on a plan, involves the calculation of the distance between a point and a line passing through two other points.p  pNow all the examples I have seen so far are applying the algorithm in a very nave way, simply by replace x and y by the latitude and longitude. This may produce acceptable results as long as the polyline is very localized, not too close to a pole, and does not cross the 180 meridian, but I would like to implement a more general version of the algorithm.p  pSo, If I am not mistaken, I would need to compute the length of the shortest arc on the surface of a sphere, from a point to the circle passing through two other points of the surface of the sphere, the center of which coinciding with the center of the sphere the earth.p  pDoes anyone know the formula that computes this lengthp  pThanks in advancep

Whats the pointa  p blockquote    pIve read tons of tutorials, wrote many classes, used them, but I still cant figure out some OOP points.p  pI mean, I think I got the theory. Its a paradigm, a different way to think and solve a problem. I know all commom points code reuse, encapsulation, better error handling, easier maintenance, inheritance, design by contract, better documentation, aggregation, composition, some design patterns...p  pThat said, lets go to the real deal. Lets say I have the followingp  ul lia database, and a class to access and query it.li liI have a table named person and another table named addressli liSimple business rule one person can have one or more address home, work, delivery..., a simple one to many relationshipli liI have a highlevel class for commom operations CRUD. Each table has a class that is a extension from this one.li liOf course, each class person and address have their own methods eg, getAddressByLocation or getPersonsByAge.li liAlso there are a dozen views and a couple formsli ul  pAll this is awesome and sure useful but... I cant stop thinking in the simplest case listing some people. Yes because every row on the output table is made upon one class instance. I cant stop thinking on how much memory and cpu is used on not used resources.p  pListing 50 people means creating 50 instances, full of resources like crud, filtering processing uploads, validating rules and so on when what I need is to run a query and just output results with a simple loop.p  pThis confuses me a lot. And not just confuse, as I already saw some apps where runtime increases exponentialy with database when business rules are a little more complex.p  pI think, is the case to create new classes or plain scripts to just handle the outputs and reports If yes, so this mean double effort, making use of OOP pointless, once I would need to create many different classes for same database entity. Coding turns harder, maintenance turns no cool.p  pAm I missing something Or this is a drawback of OOP approachp  pShould we sacrifice a straight to the point, thin, faster code in order to get faster development and maintenancep  pstrongEDITstrongp  pAs expected, some points I put before were misleading for some guys...p  pFirst, Im seasoned to really really big projects I worked at IBM vendoring for SprintNextel USA and Directv North America, so Im used to see some terabytes being processed daily.p  pWhen I said 50 people being retrieved from database, I dont mean strictly 50 people, I just want to gave the idea of many records.

These items have been deleted code has been moved or rewritten and, because most of us use the Show Deleted Items option by default some of these folders now show more deleted items and folders and legitimate items.  I want to make sure all this redundant code is gone, forever  as it most definitely will not ever be required.  These are new projects being built from branches of older ones that, as yet, nobody is using.p  pTheres quite a lot of files spread across multiple folders, though, so Id rather avoid having to do each one individually.  Im at the commandline too, not using the API.p  pI know ultimately I will need the codetf destroycode command.p  pI also know that codetf dir [wildcard] recursive deletedcode will return all deleted items within a path unfortunately alongside all legitimate items.p  pCan anyone think of a good way of doing this emquicklyemp  pIve thought of two solutionsp  p1 Take the output of the dir command and find all the items that have codeXnnnnnnncode after  these are the deleted items then simply spit out a bunch of tf destroy calls, or construct a response file not sure about this bit though.  This sounds like a potential use for Powershell, but havent actually done anything with that yet...p  p2 Get all the projects ready, and then simply destroy them from TFS and then readd them so that only the required stuff is then in TFS.  However, this does remove the branch relationship which could be useful because for a while Im going to have to maintain two versions of some of these libraries pre and post upgrade. Not ideal, but nothing I can do about it.p  pObviously Option 2 is a cheat but itll work  Id just ideally like a reusable script that could be used for any folder in TFS in the future a couple of other teams have other longlived projects that could do with a full purge.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 5350 pSo I have a transparent div which lies over a draggable youtube video.  While the youtube video is draggable, you cant pauseplay the video.  My solution to this is take a div thats the size of the buttons bottom of the video, and when a user hovers over it, the object is no longer draggable.  When the cursor leaves, the object is now draggable again.  You can still click on the bulk of the video to drag it.p  pHere inlies the problemp  pI used the CSS codepointerevents nonecode as to allow the click to go through to the video.  However, when codepointereventsnonecode, jQuery doesnt recognize the codemouseentercode, and assumes the mouse has left, thereby not letting me click on the now draggable object.p  pI could do some hacks to check the mousemovement to see if it moves into that area, but thats tedious and in general having a function called every time the mouse is moved is very inefficient as this is only a small part of the website.  Id rather not approach it this way.p  pAny ideasp  pEdit Any ideas No code necessary.p
Negative 5350 pI have my own control which derives from StackPanel. This control contains two other controls, first Border with TextBlock inside and StackPanel able to containes other StackPanels. br  Now, when I new StackPanel is added to the internal StackPanel I would like to draw a Line which could connect Border with a new added StackPanel. br  I guess this can be handle in code, so when I need StackPanel is added I could determine his and Border locations,  and base on this I could draw a line. So my question is can you see any other ways to achieve the same result how can keep the link between Border and StackPanel when one of the items it is dragging the layout  Thank you for your help BR Jarekp

Negative 5350 pBefore voting to close, please read, I know that there are similar questions p  pHeres my situation  I have an application, that is multithreaded. So, lets say I have 10 threads. All of them read from the same file descriptor its actually a socket . And in a very rare situation, when a critical error occurs, the socket should be codeshutdowncode by one of the threads. The thing is, that any of these thread can do this. If the closing of the socket has failed, codeExit FAILURE code is executed I know, that this sounds like an awful design or problem in the code, but it actually isnt, as this is caused by a nonopensource 3rd party lib, that has a bug.  p  pAnd heres the problem situation  its possible all of them to try to codeshutdowncode the socket in the same time. And one closes it, but the others cannot close it codeshutdowncode returns 1, as the socket is already closed and the bad codeExit FAILURE code is executed and that ruins everything.   p  pObviously, I need an additional check  if the socket is already closed its possible all threads to have failed shutting down the socket for some reason, and then at least one must execute codeExitcode, thats why checking the return code of codeshutdowncode is not enough.  p  pWell, I found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions893055checksocketfiledescriptorisavaiablestrongthisstronga question and it looks like thats exactly what Im trying to do. But I know, that any kind of system calls take time of course  and its OS dependent when exactly the socket will be closed.  p  pAnd heres the question  how can I make difference if a socket is already closed or it cannot be closed for some reason Will the codefcntlcode ensure me, that if one thread has closed the socket and at the same time if other thread try to codeshutdowncode the socket, it will fail and then, if I make this check  with codefcntlcode , this will work for me  p  pI also saw the other answers like you can use codeselectcode or codepollcode, but they are still system calls and I dont know if they will be the better choice. I also dont know how exactly to use them, but its not a big deal, I guess.  p  pThanksp  hr  pI can also check the codeerrnocode set by codeshutdowncode, but what does connected mean And what is the difference between connected and not a valid descriptorp  precodeENOTCONN     The specified socket is not connected. codepre  pAlso, what bothers me is, that the FD, Im trying to close, could be invalid, as I take it from codeprocnettcpcode mapped with codeprocPIDfdcode and I dont know if all files will look like the way, they look on my OS the OS will be for sure RHEL4 or RHEL5, if that mattersp  pDoh Its damn long, but I cant explain it shorter.p

Negative 5350 pwe are facing a very strange problem with our application, until now i see no option to solve the problemp  pThe application uses NHibernate 3.1.x in an sessionperconversation architecture, meaning at startend of each ASPIIS request a NHibernate session with a new transaction is openedclosed  flushedcommitted.p  pNow, we have a mailbox in the application including a simple mailgrid The mailgrid is populated first time when a user enters the mailbox startRequest creates a new NHibernate sessiontransaction, loads stuff from DB, on endRequest the session is closedp  pThe problem occurs at the deletion of a mailp  p1 the deletion of mails does not happen via a full pagereloadrefresh, instead it calls a webservice which returns the new rendered HTML grid after a message is deleted. This webservice deletes a mail by doing a simplep  precodeTMails m  TMails.GetMailByID 12345678  m.Status  MailStatusDeleted NHibernateSession.Update m  codepre  p2 After this call to update the mail, the same function also rerenders the updated mailgrid  it does this by querying for the last 5 rows in table TMails one mailbox page contains only 5 rows then, this is the current content of the mailbox for a given user.p  pThe problem now is Since both of these calls occur in the same function of the webservice and thus in the same sessiontransaction scope, the mail we want to delete in step 1, is not deleted since the updated status from NHibernateSession.Update m  does not reach the database. p  pIf i open the table via MSSQL ManagementStudio while a debugging session i can see that the status of the mail is not persited to database.p  pMy simple solution for this problem would be Doing a manual NHibernateSession.Flush call between updating the mail and reloading the content from the table But this would break the sessionperconversation pattern, since NhibernateSession.Flush isshould occuring at the end of each request  its not ought to be called manually somewhere in the running request.p  pOtherwise im really stuck.p

Negative 5350 pShould this turn out to be useful for anyone, Ill gladly turn it into a community wiki thing.p  pI have some slow pages in an MVC3 app, and since little of the execution time seemed to happen in my code, I wanted to see if I could find out more about what took so long. Not that I succeeded, but I gained a little more wisdom along the way.p  pThere is nothing here that isnt obvious to anyone with some MVC experience. Basically, I created my own ActionFilterAttribute that looks like thisp  precodepublic class ProfilerAttribute  ActionFilterAttribute      IDisposable actionStep  null     IDisposable resultStep  null      public override void OnActionExecutingActionExecutingContext filterContext              actionStep  MiniProfiler.Current.StepOnActionExecuting   ResultDescriptorfilterContext         base.OnActionExecutingfilterContext           public override void OnActionExecutedActionExecutedContext filterContext              if actionStep  null                      actionStep.Dispose             actionStep  null                  base.OnActionExecutedfilterContext           public override void OnResultExecutingResultExecutingContext filterContext              resultStep  MiniProfiler.Current.StepOnResultExecuting   ResultDescriptorfilterContext         base.OnResultExecutingfilterContext           public override void OnResultExecutedResultExecutedContext filterContext              if resultStep  null                      resultStep.Dispose             resultStep  null                  base.OnResultExecutedfilterContext           private string ResultDescriptorActionExecutingContext filterContext              return filterContext.ActionDescriptor.ControllerDescriptor.ControllerName  .  filterContext.ActionDescriptor.ActionName           private string ResultDescriptorResultExecutingContext filterContext              var values  filterContext.RouteData.Values          return String.Format0.1, values[controller], values[action]      codepre  pThis seems to work well, and in my case I have learned that most of the time is actually spent in the ResultExecuting part of life, not inside my actions. p  pHowever, I have some questions about this approach.p  p1 Is this a requestsafe way of doing things I am guessing no, since the actionfilter is created only once, in the RegisterGlobalFilters method in Global.asax.cs. If two requests appear at once, actionStep and resultStep will be worthless. Is this true If so, can someone who knows more than me contribute a clever way to handle this Works for me during local machine profiling, but probably not so much deployed on a server with multiple people making requests at the same time.p  p2 Is there any way to get more insight into the resultexecuting process Or should I just accept that rendering the view etc. takes the time it takes In my own app I ensure that all database access is finished before my action method is over using NHibernate Profiler in my case, and I like to keep my views slim and simple Any kind of insight into what slows the rendering down could still be useful, though. I guess using the Mini Profiler in my model objects would show up here, if any slow code on my part was executed here.p  p3 The ResultDescriptor methods are probably evil and poisonous. Theyve worked for me in my tests, but would probably need to be replaced by something more robust. I just went with the first versions that gave me something halfway useful.p  pAny other comments to this would also be very welcome, even if they are This is a bad idea, go die alone.p

Additionally it does not work with the Cookieless Forms Authentication as stated a hrefhttpwww.asp.netsecuritytutorialsformsauthenticationconfigurationandadvancedtopicscs relnofollowherea. p  pUsing the Session State is much easier but it can affect the performance because it stores the values in the server memory.

They are really annoying and to get the builds to run on the device , its almost like I have to do an offering to Xcode to get it to work.

Negative 5350 pI have a web page with a right floated navigation panel and content that wraps it. Content is displayed as multiple divs of same size.  The problem is that the right panel is dynamic with variable height, and in most cases when a div is  placed under the panel, then it doesnt stay in the same line with its preceding divs but becomes shifted down. This in turn increases space between the lines. I want to make so that a div would be placed under the right panel only if it would stay in the same line with the preceding divs and not break the page layout. How can I achieve this Thanksp  pMy HTMLCSSp  precodeltdiv idcontentgt ltdiv idnavrgtgtthis is rigth navigation panelltdivgt  ltdiv classprodthumbgtltdivgt ltdiv classprodthumbgtltdivgt ltdiv classprodthumbgtltdivgt ltdiv classprodthumbgtltdivgt ltdiv classprodthumbgtltdivgt ltdiv classprodthumbgtltdivgt ltdiv classprodthumbgtltdivgt ltdiv classprodthumbgtltdivgt   ltdiv classcleargtltdivgt       ltdivgt codepre  pCSSp  precodecontent  positionrelative border1px solid yellow   .prodthumb   floatleft margin10px width200px height200px backgroundcolorgrey   navrgt  positionrelative floatright right0px top0px width200px height50px height is variable. 50px is for this example only  border1px solid red   div .clear   clearboth  codepre

Negative 5350 pI have a loop that checks to see if a users daily game has started based on time.

Negative 5350 pI cant seem to find anything in the OpenRasta docs or tutorials that shows how to use arbitrary JSON objects i.e. objects not predefined using C classes for both receiving from and responding back to the client.p  pOne way to do it would be to use a hrefhttpnuget.orgListPackagesJsonValue relnofollowJsonValuea and write a custom codec that would just use the deserialization features provided by JsonValue. That should be pretty straightforward and less than 50 lines of code, but I wondered if there isnt anything built into OpenRastap  pOne downside of JsonValue is that MS has not yet released it, so a hrefhttpwcf.codeplex.comlicense relnofollowyou cant yet deploy it to customersa see 1. Additional Use Rights. But in cases where that matters, any other Json library, like a hrefhttpjson.codeplex.com relnofollowJson.NETa can be used.p

Currently, as expected the array is reset to null once the button is clicked. If I dont use the isPostBack it only retains the last value, once again as expected.  I have aspupdatepanels in place in the Ui with conditional updates and I realize that the asp.net page lifecycle still fires on the postback causing Init, Load, prerender and unload.  p  pMy asp.net is rusty but for scenarios like this is the best only approach to use Session State and store the array in the session for manipulation or am I missing something p  pThanks for any guidance,p

Negative 5350 pI have a panel derived from codeJPanelcode. I have a custom control derived from codeJLabelcode.

However when I set it to 0,0 the component goes up into the upper left corner. p  pcodeBorderLayoutcode doesnt work because when only 1 component is provided and placed into codeBorderLayout.CENTERcode, the central section expands to fill all of the space.p  pAn example I cut and pasted from another site used codeBoxLayoutcode and codecomponent.setAlignmentXComponent.CENTERALIGNMENTcode.

Negative 5350 pIn my application i have a list box with a data template on his ItemTemplate, with some text blocks and check box. I use this app to load an excel sheet, read its contents and add some itens to the list box the objective is create a text block for description and a check box for a event.p  pMy first idea was to use a DataGrid, but, when im reading the sheet, i have to create events for the check boxes one event for each CB, but i could not do it with DataGrid.  Then, i went to the list box option, using the data template in ItemTemplate. But i was stuck on the null problem object when using ContentPresenter from what i read, its because the item on the list box isnt ready, some bug on WPF.p  pSo, theres another way to automate this  Or i have to create each text block and check box p  pThanks  sorry for the bad englishp

Negative 5350 pI am trying to make an HTML5 slideshow system that implements PHP. My idea begins with making a system that detects the images in a folder, and puts them in an array, which the jquery will then be able to access for implementation in the slideshow. Firstly I have a php file that will detect the names of every file in the folder, and output them as plain text. p  pHow, instead of outputting as plain text, can i make the PHP transfer the file names to a numerical array, which can be used with the jquery that will then accompany itp  pI intend to use jquery to access the numerical array that is then made. How is this done Unless it is not possible to do, and so how else can it be donep  pThe goal is to be able to put files in a folder, and for the scripting to bdynamicallyb recognize the presence of files, and incorporate them in a slideshow. This slideshow will then be output to a screen display which will be used in a waiting area, showcasing our school with a slideshow of images about the school.p  pHere is the code that I have so farp  precodeltphp     Open images directory     dir  opendirimages     List files in images directory     while file  readdirdir  false              echo filename  . file . ltbr gt          closedirdir gt codepre  pAt this point I do not know how to make PHP talk with Javascript.

It is preferable to not Cancel the Tasks as the longer running ones might leave data in a bad state and a rollback is very tricky.p  pWhat is the best way to handle this  I thought of keeping a List of the tasks that I have started so that I can do a WaitAll.  During the execution of the service it will process tens of thousands of requests. How would I know when to remove completed Tasks from the List so the List doesnt grow wildly  I dont think I should be holding references to that many Task objects.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 5350 pI have developed one windows application,which is checking for newly updated or generated file in a directory and copying the data to a temporary file.My application is doing its job perfectly.But,There is one third party application POS Text Sender,which will read all the text from a temporary file and display on CCTV Camera if i use notepad text editor to copy data.But when my application does this work,POS Text Sender will read the contents from first file and its also trace the updated contents of that file from time to time.Once New file is generated in that directory,as usual,my application will copy the entire contents of that file to temporary file,but POS Text sender will not read that data and then if it has to display any contents,I should restart POS Text Sender.I really dont know how POS Text Sender knows that my application is copying from newly generated file and how to get it stopped.What is the difference between data writing to existing file and copy entire content from anotherp

An example of this might be dedicated number crunching on one thread and rendering tasks on another.p  pIt seems to me that under the above conditions, the threadbytasktype approach could lead to far better performance since that cores local cache would be that much more efficient emfor the specific task to which it has been assignedem Assuming that waiting is not much of an issue, i.e. both threads are running at or close to full steam.p  pI also wonder what performance impact threadsafety mechanisms might have, in loadbalanced vs naive approaches.p

Negative 5350 pI recently asked a question about how to use media queries while supporting fallback for older browsers that dont support them. The only answer while it works was to use javascript such as adapt.js to determine which stylesheet to load.p  pI have been tinkering around and realized an unbelieveably simple solution that worked for me in IE7 anyways, was the followingp  precode.wrapperwidth1024px  media all and minwidth 1025px      .wrapperwidth1024px   media all and maxwidth 1024px      .wrapperwidth1024px   media all and maxwidth 900px     .wrapperwidth900px  codepre  pThe above is just a really simple example. When I fiddling around I noticed if I specified a default value for .wrapper IE7 rendered it and ignored the media queries. In ChromeFFSafari it used the media queries css. This leads me to think this can be a compatible workaround to javaascript but Im not sure of any ramifications whether browser compatibility or SEO.p  pIs this a bad way to implement and will it have any compatibility issues I like the idea of having all css in one file.p  pAny thoughts would be appreciated, thanksp

Negative 5350 pI have a Node.js web server that runs a socket server on top, which was created using a hrefhttpwww.socket.ioSocket.ioa. Basically, this works.p  pWhat I now want to achieve is that the clients that connect are clustered in groups. So there might be some clients which make up group A and some other clients which make up group B. They shall select to which group they belong by adressing a specific URL, either codelocalhost3000Acode or codelocalhost3000Bcode.p  pIn Socket.io I now want to send messages to all clients in group A or to all clients in group B or to all clients, without looking at their group.p  pIts basically like having a chat with rooms, and you have either messages for all clients within a specific room, or for any client, no matter what room he is in.p  pWhat is the best way to design such a system using Socket.iop  pI have been trying using namespace so far, which basically works for creating groups A and B, but then I lose the ability to send messages to all clients, no matter what room they are in. At least I dont know how to do this.p  pHow should I model this What are the right terms I should look forp  pstrongUPDATEstrong According to the answer of a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers1174481sdedelbrocksdedelbrocka I could use namespace or roomsp  ul liIf use namespaces, I am not long able to send to everybody, regardless of their namespace.

According to a hrefhttpdocs.doctrineproject.orgprojectsdoctrine1enlatestenmanualyamlschemafiles.htmlpackages relnofollowDoctrine docsa I can add a package option to the schema.yml file, and generated model files will be created in the location as defined by my dotnotation entry, for examplep  precode pluginsuserPluginconfigdoctrineschema.yml  connection storerwuser  options    Fully expect resulting model files to be dropped in this directory vs the main model dir   package userPlugin.lib.model.doctrine  .... codepre  pAs mentioned, this config setup still results in model files being dropped into the main libmodeldoctrine directory.

Negative 5350 pIm having a weird problem with sounds interrupting each other in an AS3 game. p  pEach enemy in the game world has a movieclip containing its graphics and sounds game code calls gotoAndPlay to play a particular animation with corresponding sound. the movieclips are made in Flash and the .swc is imported into a Flashdevelop projectp  pThe problem is that when more than one instance of a particular type of enemy is onscreen at the same time, their sounds stomp on each other if enemies A and B are of the same type, and A is in the middle of playing a sound, B wont be able to play that sound  gotoAndPlay results in correct animation, but the sound doesnt play. p  pSimilarly, if A is playing a looping sound and B plays a frame containing a stopsound event, it will stop As loop.p  pIt seems pretty clear that whats happening is the Flashplayer is only allocating a single channel per movieclip emtypeem, rather than per movieclip instance, however google isnt really showing me anything.p  pAre there best practices for this scenario i.e multiple instances of the same movieclip which has soundanimation on its timeline What am I doing wrongp  pThanks for your time.p  p[edit] p  pTo explain a bit better what I mean, lets say theres a Baddie movieclip which contains several animations, e.g the enemy running, crouching, jumping, firing a gun.p  pThere are two layers in the movieclip, one for graphics animation, one for sound.p  pOn frame 20 theres a muzzleflash on the animation layer and a corresponding gunshot sound on the sound layer on frame 40 theres a jump animation and corresponding jump sound.p  pMy problem is if there are two or more of these movieclips on the stage at once, and one of them is in the middle of playing the gunshot sound, the others wont play the gunshot sound theyll still animate correctly though. p  pIt seems like the Flashplayer is only allocating a single audio channel for emallem instances of a certain movieclip. This seems like it cant be expected behaviour since it would be useless, so Im guessing Ive messed something up with embedding maybe theres a parameter or flag hidden somewhere which lets me say give each instance its own sound channelp

Negative 5350 pMy goal is to create a table view that shows short, but variable length and multiline, messages with a picture like a list of tweets for example. I have decided to try using AutoLayout for the views that will be added to the table because Im hoping it will simplify development in the long run, but Im having issues with layout constraints.p  pI want each table row view to expand in height to accommodate the text content, but have a fixed width that is the full width of the table view. This fixed width will change only when the window is resized.p  pIm still learning how best to use AutoLayout, but having difficulty getting my head around how it would work in this context.p  pDoes the table view need to be explicitly given the height of each row If so, where is this done, and if not how can I force the view to size correctly to fit the contentp  pI was using codeCGFloattableViewheightOfRowcode before in a horrible solution without autolayout that didnt work well. If I dont need to give the height, how will the table view get the height to give the row It seems like the tableview embeds my custom view into another view, and that one does not expand to fit, but Im not certain of this.p  pMy view hierarchy is approximately the followingp  precode  Window     Custom titlebar     Scroll View       Table View         Row View variable height           Text View         Row View variable height           Text View         Row View variable height           Text View codepre  pI hope I have described the problem well enough, if not let me know in the comments and Ill add some more detail or diagrams.p

Negative 5350 pI am working on a .Net winform project. Its a middlesize app which has several windows for editing, query and listing user data, as well as several configuration windows.   I used to be an MFC programmer, and in MFC, MDI plan works fine for this situation.each functionality has its own child window.  However, I am not  sure if MDI is the best choice for .Net winform app.  In my mind, there are two options for this project. p  ol liMDI a parent window with Menu on it. A child form will pop up if a menu item is selected.  li liSDITDI  Tab control in the main window, each tab page for one functionality.li ol  pI googled and found some negative comments on MDI solution.  But I also found some problems related to TDI solutions  1. too many controls will be stuffed into the main form User control can alleviate this pain though 2. Memory consumption  Data binding controls, such as listview and gridview control are used in some tab pages, which can consume quite a lot memory.  And this memory cannot be released when you switch to another tab. In MDI, the memory related to the databinding control is released when you close the child form.  p  pSo, for my app, which is the most reasonable management for multiple forms, please advice.p

So I decided to ask community for advices.p  pjQuery UI defines a hrefhttpwiki.jqueryui.comwpage12137970jQuery20UI20CSS20Framework relnofollowCSS Frameworka which contains class uiicon and many specific classes for different standard icons a hrefhttpwiki.jqueryui.comwpage26308090ThemeRoller20icon20set relnofollow320 total iconsa which one can see on a hrefhttpjqueryui.googlecode.comsvntagslatesttestsstaticicons.html relnofollowthe test pagea. There are a lot of plugins, web sites and so on who uses the CSS framework. For example a hrefhttpwww.trirand.comblogpageid6 relnofollowjqGrida Pluging use it. The grid which will be created by jqGrid contains the icons.p  pAfter writing a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma13865495315935the answera about the usage of a hrefhttpfortawesome.github.ioFontAwesome relnofollowFont Awesome iconsa instead of some a hrefhttpjqueryui.googlecode.comsvntagslatesttestsstaticicons.html relnofollowjQuery UI iconsa I am asking me regularly the same question strongwhy a hrefhttpjqueryui.comthemeroller relnofollowjQuery UI CSS frameworka has emrasterem icons instead of emvectorem based iconsstrong In my opinion it would be very practical to have another implementation of the Icon part of jQuery UI CSS Framework. In the case one could just replace the jQuery UI Theme and to have icons which implemented in better way.p  pWe are living now in the time of monitors with high DPI event for tablet PC and smartphones. So many people use zoom setting higher as 100 as the standard setting in the web browser. If one comparesbr img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comhaPMI.png altenter image description herebr withbr img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comGUnVA.png altenter image description herebr one would see differences very clear.p  pCurrent versions of web browsers including old IE7 supports vector based web fonts in at least one from formats WOFF, EOT, TTF, OTF or SVG. The fonts are the part of W3C Working Draft document CSS Fonts Module Level 3 see a hrefhttpwww.w3.orgTRcss3fontssrcdesc relnofollowhttpwww.w3.orgTRcss3fontssrcdesca.p  pSo why one dont replace current PNG icons of jQuery UI with web fonts alternatives There are many free open source fonts which provides already see a hrefhttpfortawesome.github.comFontAwesomeallicons relnofollowherea, a hrefhttpwww.entypo.com relnofollowherea, a hrefhttpicomoon.ioapp relnofollowherea, a hrefhttpshoestrap.orgdownloadselusiveiconswebfont relnofollowherea and so on the most but not all icons which one need.p  pAdditional benefit of using web fonts which I see will be simplifying of creating of jQuery UI Themes. If I compare the images uiiconsXXX256x240.png used inside of Base Theme, or if I compare there with the corresponding images of another Theme, then I see the color used in the images as the only difference between. In case of usage vector fonts one can just specify codecolorcode, codebackgroundcolorcode or use codelineargradientcode or coderadialgradientcode CSS styles to change colors or to produce nice color effectsbr img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comlFTF6.png altenter image description herep  pstrongI see many advantaged in usage of vector icons, but I dont found till now a good place where one could place the feature request for vector icons.strong I posted a hrefhttpsgithub.comFortAwesomeFontAwesomeissues645 relnofollowthe feature requesta and a hrefhttpsgithub.comaddyosmanijqueryuibootstrapissues127 relnofollowthis onea, but I think more and more that we have here strongcommon jQuery UI Framework problemstrong.p  pAfter a hrefhttpblog.jquery.com20130418jquery20released relnofollowrelease of jQuery 2.0a which drops support of IE 678 is it not the time to consider to replace raster based PNG icons with vector based web fontsp  pstrongProbably I miss some important disadvantages of usage vector based web fontsstrong Very bad performance for example which I didnt seen till now or some other things strongIs creating of all needed icons too complex Are there some other problemsstrongp  pI decided to ask the question to draw attention of other people to the problem which I see. Im afraid, that without the corresponding feedback from community my feature request will be have no consequences.p  pstrongWhich way would be the best for placing of such feature requeststrong I have to add that creating of fonts or picture is not the subject where I am good myself. So I cant participate in the implementation myself. Sorry.p  pAny advices or your opinions about the subject are welcome p

Negative 5350 pI have been updating a somewhat outdated tic tac toe code I found online Like it actually works now P I have it nearly complete but I keep having one same problem. The 3x3 buttons inside the tic tac toe board work perfectly,except for one thing, the color after they are clicked is always the background, I have made attempts to correct this but all it does is make the buttons not change color at all. The two colors are red and green and I would like it so that when each player clicks a button it changes to their color. If you notice my last question, youll see that I am a beginner in Java, only 13 years old but trying to learn, so please dont just say this is a stupid question.

Negative 5350 pWhen you perform a function call codemyfunction ...code in emacs lisp, the byte compiler will warn if the function isnt known to be defined at compile time. This helps greatly with a topdown programming style, since then I can happily write p  precodedefun foo bar baz   foofilterbyfuncton lambda a b equal upcase a upcase b    foocombinevalues bar baz codepre  pWhen I compile the byte compiler tells me that I havent yet defined or misspelled the two codefoocode functions. p  pHowever, if the lambda expression becomes complex some more restructuring makes sense, e.g. p  precodedefun foo bar baz   foofilterbyfuncton fooequal    foocombinevalues bar baz codepre  pNow there is a problem though... codefooequalcode is now a symbol and only at runtime when executing codefoofilterbyfunctioncode a check whether codefooequalcode is defined will be executed. Something that normally is a compiletime warning suddenly has become runtimeerror. The same problem applies for builtin higherorder functions such as codemapcarcode, codeapplycode...p  pIs there some possibility to make the byte compiler recognize, that e.g. the first argument to codemapcarcode should be a function and thus, when the argument is given as a symbol, check whether that symbol has a valid function definition, like it does with explicit codefooequal ..code callsp  pNote The purpose is to allow making production code more readable, so solutions that require a change of each call to codefoofilterbyfunctioncode or hackish code in its definition are not acceptable solutions. An example of such a counterproductive solution would be p  precodedefun foo bar baz   foofilterbyfuncton lambda a b fooequal a b ...     foocombinevalues bar baz codepre  porp  precodedefun foo bar baz   foofilterbyfuncton fooequal    foocombinevalues bar baz  defconst fooequal lambda a b ... codepre  psince both result in inferior code readability at least subjectively.p

Negative 5350 pMy application uses Coredata. Now, with the release of the new version I need to change the database structure.

I getting the following error message Premature end of file, and I know this happens because Im closing and reopens tags on rowdivider section, but I dont know how to resolve itp  precode ltContainergt  ltContainerTypegtRow2Col1ltContainerTypegt                                 ltComponentsgt                 ltxslforeach selectcontentContentContainergt                     ltxslforeach selectCTAgt                         ltComponentgt                         ltComponentTypegtCTAltComponentTypegt                          ltComponentgt                     ltxslforeachgt                     ltxslforeach selectBodyTextgt                         ltComponentgt                             ltComponentTypegtBodyTextltComponentTypegt                             ltAttributesgt                                 ltAttributegt                                     ltKeygtHtmlTextltKeygt                                      ltValuegt                                         ltxsltext disableoutputescapingyesgtamplt[CDATA[ltxsltextgt                                         ltxslvalueof selectBodyText disableoutputescapingyesgt                                         ltxsltext disableoutputescapingyesgt]]ampgtltxsltextgt                                     ltValuegt                                                             ltAttributegt                             ltAttributesgt                         ltComponentgt                     ltxslforeachgt                         ltxslforeach selectRowDividergt                                 ltComponentsgt                                 ltContainergt                                 ltContainergt                                 ltComponentsgt                         ltContainerTypegtRow3Col1ltContainerTypegt                         ltxslforeachgt                  ltxslforeachgt              ltComponentsgt         ltContainergt codepre  pThis should be the outputp  precode         ltContainergt     ltContainerTypegtRow2Col1ltContainerTypegt     ltComponentsgt         ltComponentgt             ltComponentTypegtBodyTextltComponentTypegt             ltAttributesgt                 ltAttributegt                     ltKeygtHtmlTextltKeygt                     ltValuegt                         lt[CDATA[ ltpgtTextltpgt  ]]gt                     ltValuegt                 ltAttributegt             ltAttributesgt         ltComponentgt         ltComponentgt             ltComponentTypegtCTAltComponentTypegt         ltComponentgt     ltComponentsgt ltContainergt ltContainergt     ltContainerTypegtRow3Col1ltContainerTypegt     ltComponentsgt         ltComponentgt             ltComponentTypegtBodyTextltComponentTypegt             ltAttributesgt                 ltAttributegt                     ltKeygtHtmlTextltKeygt                     ltValuegt                         lt[CDATA[ ltpgtTextltpgt  ]]gt                     ltValuegt                 ltAttributegt             ltAttributesgt         ltComponentgt     ltComponentsgt ltContainergt codepre

Negative 5350 pIve been tasked with writing some checks around a soap api, and Im having a bit of trouble.p  pIve imported the wsdl into SoapUI to test with.

I noticed that savon is using the tns namespace, and also appends the word Input to the operation name.

Negative 5350 pI am currently having some performance issues using PropertyUtilsBean.getProperty to evaluate some propertyexpressions likep  precodeobj.propert1.coolMap[1].property codepre  pI am currently using PropertyUtilsBean.getProperty for this, but it has to be executed a lot of times and I can see the enormous amount of wasted CPU time in JProfiler. As the expression for each occurance never changes, I would like to sort of preinitialize the property accessor. In an older version of my software I used reflection to save an instance of the getMethod so all I had to do, was to call the method for a given object. In the current version we added support for more complex expressions and therefore switched to PropertyUtilsBean ... seems this was a bad decision from a performance point of view. p  pIs there a way to have reusable access to a property which is able to interpret such property expressions as PropertyUtilsBean understands them I would really like to be able to do this without implementing it manually.p

Negative 5350 pI kept running into an issue while attempting to apply textures to my objects in three.js. Whenever I tried to texture an extruded geometry the texture just didnt show up.

Negative 5350 pI want to change application configuration for the connection server where I got two options Test, Production. This is set using a static string inside of one of my Helper classes.p  pNow I want to make this change from outside the application, using another icon in the system. The reason for that is that I dont want the user be able to do so And I dont want it to be a part of my application. Only the development team that has to check the application in the field could add this icon and make this change.p  pSo I dont want to create some kind of widget that will get installed with my application.p  pIs there a way to do some thing like that If so how can this be done Should I make a whole new application for thatp  pThanks.p

Negative 5350 pIm using Django, Mezzanine, and Tastypie for a CMS Im building.  Tastypie exposes an API so that another app can consume data from the CMS.  I have many Django models with ImageFields and I would like to perform some specific actions in Tastypies ModelResource dehydrate method for all ImageFields, namely generate a few thumbnails.  Rather than overriding dehydrate in every single model resource and targeting the ImageFields by name, Id like to be able to automatically check if a resources corresponding model has any ImageFields, and if so, add the thumbnails to the resources bundle.  p  pIn summary, is there a way to iterate through a model resources corresponding models fields and check the type of each in the dehydrate methodp

I will later add a cart and login using devise, along with a basic custom gem which may require additional tables.p  pI get this error when I try to enter a new video or rental. I have no problems entering genre or users. So I assume its to do with the relationships because when I remove them it works.p  pI used the following scaffolding commands inside of rubymine to create my 4 tables.p  precodeuser firstnamestring25 lastnamestring25 usernamestring25 passwordstring25 addressstring emailstring150 phonestring15 dobdate verifiedboolean adminboolean  I added the following to the resulting user.rb model file hasmany rentals  Below is the code generated and slightly modified for the user.rb model file class User lt ActiveRecordBase     hasmany rentals     attraccessible address, admin, dob, email, firstname, lastname, password, phone, username, verified end   genre genretitlestring50  I added the following to the resulting genre.rb model file hasmany videos  Below is the code generated and slightly modified for the genre.rb model file class Genre lt ActiveRecordBase     hasmany videos     attraccessible genretitle end    video titlestring50 genretitlestring50 descriptiontext purchasepricedecimal rentalpricedecimal salepricedecimal imageurlstring genrereferences  I added the following to the resulting video.rb model file hasmany rentals belongsto genre  Below is the code generated and slightly modified for the video.rb model file class Video lt ActiveRecordBase     hasmany rentals     belongsto genre     attraccessible description, genretitle, imageurl, purchaseprice, rentalprice, saleprice, title end    rental userreferences videoreferences borroweddatedatetime returneddatedatetime duedatedatetime  I added the following to the resulting rental.rb model file belongsto user belongsto video  Below is the code generated and slightly modified for the rental.rb model file class Rental lt ActiveRecordBase   belongsto user   belongsto video   attraccessible borroweddate, duedate, returneddate end codepre  pThis did generate the appropriate attraccessible lines which I modified slightly because a few fields were left out and I thought that would fix the problem.p  pThis supposedly sets up the tables and the relationships. as I want. I say supposedly because when I go into SQLite3 and enter data that breaks the relational integrity i.e. a rental with invalid user or video ids. It allows it. So the error is not coming back from the DB even though it should be.p  pI normally use C and Entity frameworks on top of SQL Server...Instead I am trying to learn ruby on rails with active record and SQLite3. Its a slow and painful process so far but I really want to give the platform a good chance as I have heard lots of good stuff about it.p  pBelow is further code I have been asked to add.

Negative 5350 pI am building an Android app that loads in 2 native shared libraries at runtime 1 that was built with an unresolved symbol in it and the other which resolves and defines that symbol.  In Java, I load the shared library that defines the symbol first, then load the library that has the symbol declared as unresolved, and at this point, the runtime fails with Cannot load library reloclibrary[] 33 cannot locate someMethodp  pSo heres the one unique difference.  The shared library with the undefined symbol obviously doesnt know about the shared library with the definition for the symbol in it.  p  pI just assumed that if I loaded the library with the definition of the method first that when I loaded the 2nd library that called the method, it would be able to find it.  Am I wrong on that  It seems in my case, an explicit dependency HAS to be compiled in between the two native libs, which means I think making .sos with unresolved symbols is useless.p  pI have searched vigorously for a similar issue with no luck.  I think my problem is due to an architectural limitation, and I am considering approaching it a couple of other ways, but I would like to know if it can be fixed simply.p  pTo be sure it wasnt some complexity of the library itself, I created two very simple C filesp  precodefcndefined.c int someMethod    return 1   fcnundefined.c extern int someMethod int someOtherMethod    someMethod  codepre  pThen build two shared objects where the fcnundefined.c code creates a .so with someMethod still undefined and fcndefined.c builds a .so with someMethod definedp  precodegcc o libfcnundefined.so fcnundefined.c shared Wl,exportdynamic gcc o libfcndefined.so fcndefined.c shared Wl,exportdynamic codepre  pDoing a nm on these produces brlibfcnundefined.sop  precode0001f08 d DYNAMIC 00001fe8 d GLOBALOFFSETTABLE 00002004 A bssstart          U cxaatexit          U cxafinalize 00002000 d dsohandle 00000290 t ondlclose 00002004 A edata 00002004 A end 000002a0 t atexit 000002b4 T someOtherMethod          U someMethod codepre  pand libfcndefined.sop  precode00001f0c d DYNAMIC 00001fec d GLOBALOFFSETTABLE 00002004 A bssstart          U cxaatexit          U cxafinalize 00002000 d dsohandle 0000025c t ondlclose 00002004 A edata 00002004 A end 0000026c t atexit 00000280 T someMethod codepre  pSo you can see someMethod is defined in libfcndefined.so and it appears in the read elf dynsym section and is undefined in the other lib.p  pIf anyone is interested in the readelf output, I can add that as well.p  pIn the Java side, I have a simple button in the emulator that I click, and it creates a class with the following in itp  precodestatic          System.loadLibraryfcndefined         System.loadLibraryfcnundefined  codepre  pJust out of curiosity, I added a lfcndefined to the fcnundefined compile line, and compared the nm and readelf outputs.  the only difference in nm was that the T someOtherMethod started a few bytes further out and the readelf difference was the NEEDED line for fcndefined.  Thats pretty much about what I expected.  strongAnd it doesnt crash like this.strongp  pThats pretty much the full explanation.  I did find some details about how Android forces you to load your libraries in reverse dependency order in Java, because it has rather it had, has been fixed in API 18 no reference to your apps lib path in the LDLIBRARYPATH envvar.  Unfortunately, I am requiring a minimum API lvl 10 to be able to use my app because of the market penetration, and secondly I tried API 19 anyway, and it still fails.p  pIf I had to guess, I believe Android just doesnt support finding a symbol if you havent explicitly told it to look at library X for the symbol.  In other words, because I didnt build the library fcnundefined with an explicit dependency on libfcndefined.so, Android cant resolve it.  Does anyone know if this is a bug or by design  Is this normal  It seems like you wouldnt have the option to create a .so with unresolved symbols if this was the case, and even funnier is that the Android NDK toolchain Im using to build this has this feature on by default when you use ld it doesnt complain about unresolved, and I tried turning the feature off but didnt seem to do anything, no warnings or errors generating the library.p  pSo you may ask why I dont just compile the fcnundefined library with a dependency on the fcndefined library.  Well that gets into a much bigger architectural discussion.  The code Im working with fcnundefined.c in this example is a python extension built with a cross compiled python toolchain for ARM, and Im calling this library from an NDK library, so now the NDK library depends on the python module which has an unresolved method in Python, which is defined in a static lib.  Linking the static lib into the NDK shared lib means that I cant load the native shared libs in the correct order in Java due to the issue mentioned previously that they fixed in API 18.  Im trying to work with the existing system since a team of others use it, and it is used to build for many platforms.  emsighem  I clearly have other things to figure out, but I was hoping to nail the one above down at least.p

Negative 5350 pEdit Just ran into a wrinkle, I just got this working on an iPhone over the weekend and just out of curiosity ran it on two phones at once and it worked. So it ran happily along as I expected it to the first time when one phone was an iPhone iOS 6 and the other was HTC One Android 4.3. This was however on another persons WIFI. Could my home WIFI be a factor in blocking two devices going to the same location The second phone I was using when it didnt work was a Samsung Galaxy Ace 2 Android 2.3  p  pSo Ive got this problem. I am using PhoneGap and coming up with a basic quiz system to muck around with. Ive got it working and Im having a great time. It works essentially through a web console where I can set up a quiz and cycle through questions and with a not so complex series of status updates to an underlying database I use Ajax calls from my mobile to read the status and display a question or wait for the next one.p  pBasic call isp  precodefunction checkForQuestion      var postData  stuff needed in called PHP     .ajax         type POST,                        data postData,                      url my called php,                    success functiondata                         var result  JSON.parsedata         if result  question              Display Question          else              setTimeoutcheckForQuestion, 1000             return false                            return false   codepre  pIn my limited experience this seems to be a general use of Ajax with a recursive call back if it needs to wait for a new status. p  pNow this isnt everything by far, but a taster of what Im doing. It works extremely well with one mobile device and a web console happily working through quizzes.p  pWhen I attempt to add a second mobile havent even attempted three yet what happens is the second mobile just silently fails where it is supposed to be calling this ajax. Now the second mobile can quite happily chug along with this on its own so it shouldnt be a hardware issue. There are no errors thrown out in the PHP, and with a little logging I cant find anything obviously failing.p  pAt this point I thought, perhaps there is a limit on connections on my web host Im just using a shared server web host Im using to test this out and there are but that is limited to 20 entry processes with Cloud Linux LVE. However This should not preclude two mobiles calling the same PHP via wifi at roughly the same time. It should just run the calls concurrently and one will return slight faster than the other or that is my understanding.p  pI thought perhaps this is a lock put on the MySQL database Im using not allowing multiple usersPHP to query it at roughly the same time, but the consecutive nature of PHP should rule that out and some Googling assures me that calls will be queued.p  pIm guessing that what is happening is the two calls come in and without returning any error one silently conflicts with the other causing a fail, but I have no idea hwo to find the fail and fix it.p  pAny suggestions p  pRequest for the actual codep  precodefunction       document.onpagebeforeshow, page6, function           document.getElementByIdmobusername2.innerHTML  window.localStorage.getItemmoblocalloginname          function checkForQuestion              sort out the data to be posted             var postData  mobquizwaitquizcode . concatwindow.localStorage.getItemmoblocalquizcode, ampmobquizwaitemail, window.localStorage.getItemmoblocalloginemail, ampmobquizwaitpassword, window.localStorage.getItemmoblocalloginpassword, ampmobquizwaitquestionid, window.localStorage.getItemmobquestionid              .ajax                 type POST,                                data postData,                              url url of php,                           success functiondata                                     var mobquizwaitdata  JSON.parsedata                     if mobquizwaitdata.mobquizwaitsuccess  mob quizwait go                          window.localStorage.setItemmobquestionid, mobquizwaitdata.mobquizwaitquestionid                         window.localStorage.setItemmobquestionscore, mobquizwaitdata.mobquizwaitscore                         window.localStorage.setItemmobquestioncategory, mobquizwaitdata.mobquizwaitcategory                         window.localStorage.setItemmobquestionquestion, mobquizwaitdata.mobquizwaitquestion                         window.localStorage.setItemmobanswer1, mobquizwaitdata.mobquizwaitcorrect                         window.localStorage.setItemmobanswer2, mobquizwaitdata.mobquizwaitwrong1                         window.localStorage.setItemmobanswer3, mobquizwaitdata.mobquizwaitwrong2                         window.localStorage.setItemmobanswer4, mobquizwaitdata.mobquizwaitwrong3                         .mobile.changePagepage7, transitionslide, changeHashfalse                      else if mobquizwaitdata.mobquizwaitsuccess  mob quizwait stay                          setTimeoutcheckForQuestion, 1000                         return false                      else if mobquizwaitdata.mobquizwaitsuccess  mob quizwait intermission                          document.getElementByIdmobintermission.innerHTML  Intermission                         .mobile.changePagepage6, transitionnone, changeHashfalse                      else if mobquizwaitdata.mobquizwaitsuccess  mob quizwait finish                          .mobile.changePagepage8, transitionslide, changeHashfalse                      else                          navigator.notification.alertStatus Check Failed.

Negative 5350 pIve been using Boosts ASIO library to do network and socket communication. Now Im getting to a point in the development cycle where Id like to clean things up and make them a little more modular. My first thought was that I would use a separate project for just the network communication part essentially factoring out the Boostdependent stuff and use one visual studio project in two different visual studio solutions. Something likep  precodeClient.sln gt  Client.vcxproj gt  Networking.vcxproj  Server.sln gt  Server.vcxproj gt  Networking.vcxproj codepre  pI tried to do this, but I have the problem that my Networking.vcxproj has turned into a headeronly project due to the fact that Im creating nothing but template classes. What I would ideally like to do is place the references to the boost precompiled libs only in the Networking.vcxproj and link against the output of Networking.vcxproj. However, if I understand correctly, theres nothing to link against since my Networking.vcxproj has no .cpp files.p  pIs there any way to link against my Networking project and the boost ASIO libs without specifying all the additional library dependencies in all the projects i.e. Is there any way to somehow create the project settings so that I dont have to duplicate the boost library dependencies every time I create a new application which uses the Networking.vcxproj projectp

Negative 5350 pIm working in an Android game using libGDX framework while a learn from their wiki and a hrefhttprads.stackoverflow.comamznclick1782166041 relnofollowLearning Libgdx Game Developmenta book. The author of the book defines an Assets class to load game assets using an AssetManager. Every time the game is resumed the assets need to be reloaded so he use a call to Assets.intance.initnew AssetManager what reload the assets and create new objects to store textures references.p  pWhen I do this in my game, after resume, all I have are black boxes where I had nice textures so I suppose that the problem here is that Im using the old references.

My real question is, how should I manage game assets in my game Ive been searching a lot for game examples but most of them dont use an AssetManager but instead static variables to textures.p  pShould I keep references of textures in game objects It is really necessary to reload assets on resume How could I reload textures in my game objects when all the objects are inside a worldController that dont know when a game is being resumedp

Negative 5350 pIm currently implementing a lexer for a simple programming language. So far, I can tokenize identifiers, assignment symbols, and integer literals correctly in general, whitespace is insignificant.p  pFor the input codefoo  42code, three tokens are recognizedp  ol licodefoocode identifierli licodecode symbolli licode42code integer literalli ol  pSo far, so good. However, consider the input codefoo  42barcode, which is stronginvalidstrong due to the significant missing space between code42code and codebarcode. My lexer incorrectly recognizes the following tokensp  ol licodefoocode identifierli licodecode symbolli licode42code integer literalli licodebarcode identifierli ol  pOnce the lexer sees the digit code4code, it keeps reading until it encounters a nondigit. It therefore consumes the code2code and stores code42code as an integer literal token. Because whitespace is insignificant, the lexer discards any whitespace if there is any and starts reading the next token It finds the identifier codebarcode.p  pstrongNow, heres my questionstrong Is it still the lexers responsibility to recognize that an identifier is not allowed at that position Or does that check belong to the responsibilities of the parserp

Negative 5350 pContextp  ul lipI am attempting to combine a large amount of separate password list text files into a single file for use in dictionary based password cracking.pli lipEach text file is line delimited a single password per line and there are 82 separate files at the moment. Most 66 files are in the 1100Mb filesize range, 12 are 100700Mb, 3 are 2Gb, and 1 the most problematic is 11.2Gb.pli lipIn total I estimate 1.75 billion nonunique passwords need processing of these I estimate 450 million 25 will be duplicates and ultimately need to be discarded.pli lipI am attempting to do this on a device which has a little over 6Gb of RAM free to play with i.e. 8Gb with 2Gb already consumed.pli ul  pProblemp  pI need a way to a aggregate all of these passwords together and b remove exact duplicates, within my RAM memory constrains and within a reasonable 7 days, ideally much less but really I dont care if it takes weeks and then I never need to run it again time window.p  pI am a competent Python programmer and thus gave it a crack several times already. My most successful attempt used sqlite3 to store processed passwords on the hard disk as it progressed. However this meant that keeping track of which files had already been completed between processing instances I cancelled and restarted several times to make changes was tediously achieved by hashing each completed file and maintainingcomparing these each time a new file was opened. For the very large files however, any progress would be lost.p  pI was processing the text files in blocks of 1 billion at most lines at a time to prevent memory exhaustion without having no feedback for extended periods of time. I know that I could, given a lot of time populate my database fully as I achieved a DB filesize of 4.5Gb in 24 hours of runtime so I estimate that left to run it would take about 4 days at most to get through everything, but I dont know ifhow to most efficiently readwrite to it nor do I have any good ideas on how to tackle the removing of duplicates do it as I am populating the DB or make additional passes afterwards... Is there a much faster means of doing lookups for uniqueness in a database configuration I dont know about.p  hr  pMy request here today is for advice  solutions to a programming and optimisation approach on how to achieve my giant, unique password list ideally with Python. I am totally open to taking a completely different tack if I am off the mark already.p  hr  pTwo nice to haves arep  ul lipA way to add more passwords in the future without having to rebuild the whole list andpli lipA database lt 20Gb at the end of all this so that it isnt a huge pain to move around.pli ul  hr  pstrongSolutionstrongp  pBased on CLs solution which was ultimately a lot more elegant than what I was thinking I came up with a slightly modified method.p  pFollowing CLs advice I setup a sqlite3 DB and fed the text files into a Python script which consumed them and then output a command to insert them into the DB. Straight off the bat this did work but was extremely infeasibly slow.p  pI solved this by a few simple DB optimisations which was much easier to implement and frankly cleaner to just do all from the core Python script included below which builds upon CLs skeleton code. The fact that the original code was generating strongsooooooostrong many IO operations was causing something funny on my Win7 OS causing BSODs and lost data. I solved this by making the insertion of a whole password file one SQL transaction plus a couple of pragma changes. In the end the code runs at about 30,000 insertions  sec which is not the best but is certainly acceptable for my purposes.p  pIt may be the case that this will still fail on the largest of files but ifwhen that is the case, I will simply chunk the file down into smaller 1Gb portions and consume them individually.p  precodeimport sys import apsw  i  0 con  apsw.Connectionpasswordstest.db cur  con.cursor  cur.executeCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Passwordspassword TEXT PRIMARY KEY WITHOUT ROWID cur.executePRAGMA journalmode  MEMORY cur.executePRAGMA synchronous  OFF  cur.executeBEGIN TRANSACTION for line in sys.stdin     escaped  line.rstrip.replace,      cur.executeINSERT OR IGNORE INTO Passwords VALUES, escaped,     i  1     if i  100000  0  Simple line counter to show how far through a file we are         print i  cur.executeCOMMIT con.closeTrue codepre  pThis code is then run from command linep  precodeinsertpasswords.py lt passwordfile1.txt codepre  pAnd automated byp  precodefor f in .txt do  insertpasswords.py lt f  codepre  pAll in all, the DB file itself is not growing too quickly, the insertion rate is sufficient, I can breakresume operations at the drop of a hat, duplicate values are being accurately discarded, and the current limiting factor is the lookup speed of the DB not the CPU or disk space.p

Negative 5350 pOkay, so heres the deal. I followed all the instructions found in stackoverflow, thanks to reconfigure the php.ini settings to send emails through localhost using gmails smtp. I was using the wired connection at my workplace.p  pAll is fine till I used my own wifi connection at home. A simple mail function took more than 30 seconds to finish executing the code.

Negative 5350 pSo I have been developing a chat messenger application for a school assignment and I have run into a metaphorical wall.p  pThe application allows you to log in to a sever through a username from which you can initiate chat with other user.p  pFor the most part it is working, it connects and you can send messages however when you try to send consecutive messages it seems like the server ignores the dataas it is sent by the client even though the sockets are still connected. It will not acknowledge this message until it receives another from client.p  pThis is a video of the issue a hrefhttpswww.youtube.comwatchv8bUV6Ns02sYampfeatureyoutu.be

Negative 5350 pMy goal is to run a recipe once, before all other targets are executed, and preferably without creating a dummy file or adding a dependency to every target.p  pMy initial thoughts was to define a target like the followingp  precodeonce     stuff to do once   once  actualtarget actual dependencies     actualrecipe codepre  pHowever I believe that will cause the codeoncecode target to run once for every target, rather than once per make. So my second thought was to do the followingp  precodeoncedefault     stuff to do once     make actualdefault  actualdefault actual dependencies     actualrecipe codepre  pAnd although this achieves the oncepermake requirement, it only works for the default target. It seems silly to write a bash script to wrap codemakecode, as codemakecode should have this sort of functionality. and touching a once file emshouldntem be needed, given the existence of code.PHONYcode. This is something I only need for this oneoff project, so GNU extensions are fine.p

Each codeObject[]code in the list has a codeBigDecimalcode at index 0 and a codeLongcode at index 1.  The codeBigDecimalcode is actually a date, something like code20141001code.  What Im wondering is if there is a way I can update the codedateCountscode set using this data in a Stream fashion.  Right now, Im doing the following which just iterates over the list of object arrays and creates new codeDateCountcode objects that are then added to the codedateCountscode set.  The codeDateCountcode class has a custom codeequalscode and codehashCodecode method to ensure the codedateCountscode set contains only a single codeDateCountcode instance for any given date.p  precodedata.stream         .forEachobj gt              DateTime date  null             try                  date  sdf  null  new DateTimeobj[0]  new DateTimesdf.parseobj[0].toString                 dateCounts.addnew DateCountdate.toDate, Long obj[1]              catch ParseException e                  e.printStackTrace                       codepre  pOn a side note, Im wondering if theres also a way to avoid doing a trycatch in my lambda expression just for parsing a codeStringcode to a codeDatecode.p  pstrongUpdatestrong  This is what Ive come up with so far.  It doesnt seem natural though to stream over the codeListltObject[]gtcode within the .map call, not sure if theres a better way.  I introduced my own codeTupleltX, Ygtcode class because working with an codeObject[]code in streams doesnt work very well given theres no accessor methods.  Also in the last 2 lines, Im creating a codeTreeSetcode with a codeComparatorcode so that I can sort the data by date.  I dont feel thats the best approach, but I tried calling codesortedcode and making codeDateCountcode implement codeComparablecode which seems to work fine, but as soon as the codecollecttoSetcode method is called, the sorting goes out the window.  I assume thats the nature of it being a streamed call.  Im curious if theres a way to sort it though before the collect method call and retain the sort after calling collect.p  precodeSetltDateCountgt dateCounts  IntStream.range0, DAYSINWEEK         .mapToObjidx gt new Tupleltgtnew DateTime.withTimeAtStartOfDay.plusDaysidx.toDate, 0L         .mapt gt              TupleltString, Longgt d  data.stream                     .maparr gt new Tupleltgtarr[0].toString, Long arr[1]                     .filtertuple gt sdf.formatt.getX.equalstuple.getX                     .findFirst.orElsenew Tupleltgtsdf.formatt.getX, 0L              return new DateCountDateTime.parsed.getX, DateTimeFormat.forPatternyyyyMMdd.toDate, d.getY                  .collecttoSet  TreeSetltDateCountgt set  new TreeSetltgta, b gt a.compareTob set.addAlldateCounts codepre

Negative 5350 pstrongUpdate please see my EDIT section below where I explain what I have discovered after testingstrongp  pIm working on a website with CakePHP 2.5.1, and Im experiencing a very strange behavior strongonestrong of the 2 models I have emseemsem to refuse to use a different database configuration other than the default one if I dont place it in Cakes default strongModelstrong folder if I place it there everything works great. p  pBoth models are located in the same folder, which happens to be strongnot the default Model folderstrong this is because those are shared with other websites and I have a central place where I put all the shared ones.p  pTo make Cake find those models I use the following line of code in the strongbootstrap.phpstrong file codeAppbuildarrayModel gt arraydirnameROOT . DS . sharedCakev2Modelcodep  pThe 2 models I have there are called emCampanyaem and emEjercicioMultChoiceem.p  pEverything seems to be setup properlyp  ul liIf I print codeAppobjectsModelcode I can see both models listed there, which means Cake is finding them in that external folderli liIf I print codegetclassvarsDATABASECONFIGcode I can see both database configurations the strongdefaultstrong one, used by emCampanyaem, and the strongcustomstrong one called strongBDContenidosstrong, used by emEjercicioMultChoiceem.li liBoth models are included in the strongAppController.phpstrong with the codeusescode variable array.li ul  pI can call the emCampanyaem model in the controller without any problem. However, when call the emEjercicioMultChoiceem model, I get the following errorp  precodeMISSING DATABASE TABLE Error Table ejerciciomultchoices for model EjercicioMultChoice was not found in datasource default. codepre  pThis is how the emEjercicioMultChoiceem model file looks likep  precodeclass EjercicioMultChoice extends AppModel   public name  EjercicioMultChoice public primaryKey  id public useTable  ejerciciosmultiplechoice public useDbConfig  BDContenidos   codepre  pAs you can see, that model indicates to use a specific database configuration, which Cake is aware of, but in the error shown above its saying that it cant find the table in datasource strongdefaultstrong. It cant because its not there of course, its in another table in another database which by the way this other database is in the same server as the default one and I use it without issues on other projects.p  pAs I mention above, if I move that exact same emEjercicioMultChoice.phpem model file to Cakes default strongappModelstrong folder, then I dont have any issues.p  pSo Im a bit lost here, I dont know what else I can check to find what the issue is. Any help would be much appreciatedp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pSo I believe Ive discovered what the problem is, and a workaround about it, but I still would like to know why this is happening and how can I make it work as it should.p  pIf I add these 2 lines of code strongboth of themstrong before calling the model then it all works finep  precodethisgtEjercicioMultChoicegtsetDataSourceBDContenidos thisgtEjercicioMultChoicegtsetSourceejerciciosmultiplechoice codepre  pThis clearly means that even though Cake finds the emEjercicioMultChoice.phpem model file, which indicates the database and table names, it ignores those 2 variables stronguseTablestrong and stronguseDbConfigstrong. The only way to make it work is by manually setting those 2 variables with the methods that I wrote above.p  pWhy is this happening This does not happen if the model file is in the default folder...p

Negative 5350 pI have a wordcount program where I am reading from a character array, and inserting every word found checking for blankspace into a codeHashMapltCharacter[], Integergtcode, where the first parameter is the word, and the second parameter is the number of times it has been found.p  pI do not use StringBuilder or Tokenizer because I am avoiding using Strings, as I am reading a 10gb file, and since Strings are immutable, it seems to cause memory issues.p  pThe following code seems to lag after reading only 2030mb of the file.

Not sure how to fix this without using Strings.p  pNote  I build the word using an codeArrayListltCharactergtcode  I then convert the array list into a codeCharacter []code.

Negative 5350 pI am currently trying to write a script to determine the minimum number of jumps you can make in an array to get back to the initial starting number.  The starting number is always the biggest number in the array.p  pAs an example if the array was code[2, 3, 5, 6, 1]code then the starting number would be 6 because it is the biggest.  You can then jump 6 positions either left or right you can choose and where you end up is your next number.  Lets say we went right, we would end up at code1code because we would loop back to the beginning of the array.  You could then go code1code left and end up back at the code6code again.  Therefore the minimum number of jumps is strong2strong.p  pI wrote the below functions to take the input array and determine the minimum number of jumps, however, the recursion in the codesearchcode function is not working as I would hope  expect.p  pEach search function call calls itself 2 times once for left, and once for right, however the constantly incrementing codecountcode variable gets confused.  Once one line of recursion ends when codecountgtarr.lengthcode I would expect it to go back to the previous step and do the right line of recursion.  But the codecountcode variable does not revert to the previous step it stays as it is and therefore the entire function just stops.p  pTL DR  How do you make a javascript functions variables maintain what they are even when the function is called again and the variables are overwrittenp  precodefunction ArrayJumpingarr     Find the largest number   var startingPosarr.indexOfMath.max.applynull, arr   Find the multiple we are searching for   var multiplearr.length   return searchstartingPos,multiple,arr,startingPos1,0  function searchpos,mult,arr,target,count    if countgtarr.length      return false      var tpospos1   if tpostarget ampamp count0  tpostarget0 ampamp count0      return count      for var direction1directionlt1direction2      nPosgetRealPosposdirectionarr[pos],arr     var resultsearchnPos,mult,arr,target,count1     if resultfalse        return result           function getRealPosn,numArr    if ngt0      while ngtnumArr.length        nnumArr.length         else      while nlt0        nnumArr.length           return n  codepre

Negative 5350 pIve got a potentially really dumb question, but how do I modify variables up in rootScope in Angular Ive got a slidein sidebar that I want to change the content on whenever someone clicks on a thumbnail, and I figured the easiest way to handle where the data in the sidebar comes fromthe sidebar visibility would either be in global values, or in rootScope.

Ive been banging my head against this for about three hours now, breaking everything else on this app whenever I get the chance. What am I screwing up here  Alternatively, is there a better way of doing thisp  pMy reason for using global variables is that I have multiple thumbnails in multiple controllers, and I want each one to be able to dynamically change the URL in my nginclude.p

Negative 5350 pIve been playing with Java 8 lambda expressions for a month and Im pretty happy with everything it can do. I especially like the abstraction of streams to iterate over a collection of elements more efficiently and with less code. p  pNow one thing Im trying to figure out is abstracting a text file or SQL query of records into a stream of some sorts while still allowing it to be buffered. I already have tried to implement the Stream interface and got overwhelmed by the abstract methods. p  pId paste my work in progress but so far it all has fallen flat, and my research is coming up nil too. Can someone show an example of how to turn a CSV using a BufferedReader into a stream for each line All while maintaining the buffered nature Id also like it to support parallel too. This way, for every record that is buffered, it can be passed to a series of higher order functions in parallel.p

Negative 5350 pI am doing some REST samples and for that installed Tomcat 8.  IDE is Eclipse Luna.p  pI created a maven web archetype project and found that it is using J2SE5 runtime environment and while deploying the code I see that Tomcat is using JDK 1.7.p  pThere was no question asked about the target jdk to be used when creating the project so I was not aware of what it is using.p  pDoes this creates problemp  pAs I understand the project compiled on lower version can run on the higher version but still I just want to know what complications may arise in such case.p  pThanksp

Negative 5350 pI am trying to make a kind of data miner with python. What I am about to examine is a dictionary of the Greek language. The said dictionary was originally in PDF format, and I turned it into a rougly corresponding HTML format to parse it more easily. I have done some further formating on it, since the data structure was heavily distorted.  p  pMy current task is to find and seperately store the individual words, along with their descriptions. So the first thought that came to mind about that, was to identify the words first, apart from their descriptions. The headers of the words space has a very specific syntax, and I use that to create a corresponding regular expression to match each and every one of them.  p  pThere is one problem though. Despite the formatting I have done to HTML so far, there are still many points where a series of logical data is interrupted by the sequence lt br followed by a newline, with random order. Is there any way to direct my regular expression to ignore that sequence, that is to treat that certain sequence as nonexistent, when met, and therefore including those matches which are interrupted by itp  pThat is, without putting a lt brn in every part of my RE, to cover every possible case.  p  pThe regular expression I use is the following p  precode ltbgt[]ltbgt,  ltbgt[]ltbgt . []. .ltbgtltbgt   codepre  pand does a fine job with the matching, when the data is not interrupted by the sequence given above.p  pThe problem, in case not understood, lies in that the interrupting sequence can occur anywhere within the match, therefore I am looking for a way other than covering every single spot where the sequence might occur ignoring the sequence in deciding whether to return a match or not, as I explained earlier.p

Negative 5350 pTLDR at bottomp  pA little back story for context. Im creating an xml tool that will enable folks to input data needed for a game were making without having to worry about handjobbing XML directly. The tool will output various XML files to be used by the game engine for example, complex NPC Dialogue nodes with references to scripts to run when a given piece of dialogue is used... basically all the data to feed the game engine.p  pIm stuck trying to figure out a perplexing issue Im having...p  pIm creating a list view as a user control named ActionsBox  need reusability on it, with a data template that contains a ComboBox. The ComboBox needs to have its values filled from an xml config file readonly, but I made it a full viewmodel for constancy, but the selected item will need to be bound to a string property in a separate viewmodel which store actual content instead of configstatic things. From what Ive read this wont really work as controls cant be bound to two different things.p  pThe purpose of this bit is to constrain people using the tool to only select appropriate values i.e. make sure they only select scripts that actually exist in the game engine. Well be updating this config XML file every time we add a new script to the engine that can be called from XML.p  pI have a feeling I might be going about this wrong overarchitecturally, but cant really think of any good way to solve it and google isnt being all that helpful.p  pWhats the best way to tackle this approach code and architecture detail followsp  pXml  The goal is to fill this combobox with script namesp  precodeltConditionScriptsgt     ltScriptgt       ltNamegtTest Script 1ltNamegt       ltDescriptiongtThis script does xltDescriptiongt       ltParametersgt         ltParametergt           ltNamegtTestStrltNamegt           ltTypegtstringltTypegt           ltDescriptiongtBlah blahltDescriptiongt         ltParametergt       ltParametersgt     ltScriptgt     ltScriptgt       ltNamegtTest Script 2ltNamegt       ltDescriptiongtThis script does yltDescriptiongt       ltParametersgt         ltParametergt           ltNamegtTestStrltNamegt           ltTypegtstringltTypegt           ltDescriptiongtBlah blahltDescriptiongt         ltParametergt         ltParametergt           ltNamegtTestIntltNamegt           ltTypegtintltTypegt           ltDescriptiongtBlahBlahltDescriptiongt         ltParametergt       ltParametersgt     ltScriptgt   ltConditionScriptsgt codepre  pConfig viewmodel holding the namep  precodepublic class ConfigScriptViewModel  ViewModelBase      region Properties     private string name     public string Name              get  return Name          set                        name  value             OnPropertyChanged                    private string description     public string Description              get  return description          set                      description  value             OnPropertyChanged                    private ObservableCollectionltConfigScriptParameterViewModelgt parameters     public ObservableCollectionltConfigScriptParameterViewModelgt Parameters              get  return parameters          set                      parameters  value             OnPropertyChanged                   endregion      public ConfigScriptViewModelXElement scriptNode              this.Name  scriptNode.ElementName.Value         this.Description  scriptNode.ElementDescription.Value          var paramsVm  new ObservableCollectionltConfigScriptParameterViewModelgt          foreach var param in scriptNode.ElementParameters.Elements                      var paramVm  new ConfigScriptParameterViewModelparam             paramsVm.AddparamVm                   this.Parameters  paramsVm       codepre  pThe above is held in another ViewModel  ConfigViewModel which has them stored in an ObservableCollection and is the highest level of the Config branch.

Negative 5350 pSo I am using QueryBuilder in some of my projects, but others I need to create RAW SQL queries in order to increase performance, as I have more than a million rows with their relations...p  pWhat I found awful about QueryBuilder, is the fact that it creates several queries when you have relations, for example, I have a codeOneToManycode relation from codeProductcode to codeImagecode and a codeManyToOnecode on the inversed side.p  pMy query has a pagination, so it is limited to codeLIMIT 10 OFFSET 0code and on. My codeImagecode entity has about 2.7 million rows, thats why I am using pagination, doing this simple query, which fetches codeImage icode plus codeProduct pcode because I need codep.titlecode I end up with 1 Query for my 10 images, and 10 queries for each codeProductcode for codeImagecode.p  pThats unneeded, It can be done with just 2 queries, one for codeImagecode and one for codeProductcode, using codefetchEAGERcode thats what I get. But I need to put codefetchEXTRALAZYcode inside codeProductcode mapping, otherwise I will get 11 queries again..p  pWith just 10 images isnt hard, but when the user filters 500 images, response time gets higher and higher... Thats why Ive ended up doing RAW queries, best performance, no extra queries just 1 query that contains everything BUT unable to work with objects like QueryBuilder does, cant access to codeimage.product.titlecode inside twig to get the title, instead I need to do codeSELECT p.title AS producttitlecode and call codeimage.producttitlecode etcp  pSo I need to know why QueryBuilder is that sht when reading but so marvelous when persisting objects easy, fast, clean... and how can I work with huge DBs using QueryBuilder without loosing performance and without getting tons of extra unneeded queries.p  pAn example query, is this onep  precodeqb  thisgtcreateQueryBuilderi qbgtinnerJoini.product, p qbgtwherei.X  Y return qbgtgetQuerygtgetResult codepre  pUsing codeqbgtselecti, pcode seems to use only one query, which its runnable raw has an INNER JOIN which is actually how it is supossed to work WITHOUT the  codeqbgtselectcode but performance is still lower than doing a RAW SQL query... RAW SQL  500MS for a 10.000 rows query, using QB its 1,100 MS. I know I wont use 10.000 rows, but theres a chance...p  pThe question is still the same, what advantages and disadvantages, besides the object manipulation, which is gone with a RAW SQL. And when to use LAZY or EAGER and WHY, or whywhen you dont need them.p  pAll of this may end a discussion in my DevTeam once for all. As Im a QB lover.p

Negative 5350 pSituation  Language C using the C Driver I have a model that contains a List as a property. That List can contain one of 3 different models that all inherit the BaseModelClass. To assist in serialization of this situation Mongo adds t to identify which of the models is actually being used. For us this is a problem due to the amount of space that t is taking up. I am a lowly dev, I have asked for more space and ram and they have told me to solve it without the additional space. So I sat down to writing a custom serializer that handled the different types without writing a t to the BSONDocument. I thought all was great until I started doing my unit testing of the serialization. I started getting ReadEndArray can only be called when ContextType is Array, not when ContextType is Document.p  pAny advice or suggestions are greatly appreciated.p  pHere is the code I have thus

As expected the coderdfssubPropertyOfcode creates two rdf triples. One uses the property codeexasWKTcodeand the other one contains the super property codegeoasWKTcode.p  pThe problem is that there is no update on the Spatial Index of the triple store via this method, preventing the execution of any spatial query. The aforementioned index can be recreated using the functionality that is provided by the UI, solving the problem but is there a way to achieve that using java code For instance, using a method to trigger the Spatial Index update.p  pThank you in advance.p

My app is a .NET application, and there was a form on the master page.  Because I was using a button of typesubmit, the form was being submitted, which cancels the redirect unless you do a preventDefault on it.  In my debugging, I was using an ngclick function on a header element to do the redirect.  That worked fine because it didnt submit the form, but it also led me down the wrong path in thinking it was a scoping problem.p

Negative 5350 pI have created a hash map class that mimics the stl map except for the use of iterators. So, now my problem is looping through the hash map, without using iterators, and printing out the Value that is associated with a certain Key. The class itself is templated, but the Value used in the main.cpp is a vector of strings. How would I make a print function that will print the items Value associated with a Key I tried writing a printElements function, but it only prints the Key.

Negative 5350 pAccording to Apple p  blockquote   pWhen you mark a member declaration with the codedynamiccode modifier, access to that member is always dynamically dispatched. Because declarations marked with the codedynamiccode modifier are dispatched using the ObjectiveC runtime, theyre implicitly marked with the codeobjccode attribute. p blockquote  pAccording to Wikipediap  blockquote   pstrongdynamic dispatchstrong is the process of selecting which implementation of a polymorphic operation method or function to call at run time.p      pDynamic dispatch is often used in objectoriented languages when different classes contain different implementations of the same method due to common inheritance. For example, suppose you have classes codeAcode, codeBcode, and codeCcode, where codeBcode and codeCcode both inherit the method codefoocode from codeAcode. Now suppose codexcode is a variable of class codeAcode. At run time, codexcode may actually have a value of type codeBcode or codeCcode and in general you cant know what it is at compile time.p blockquote  pRight now, Im studying the  a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiDependencyinjection relnofollowdependency injectiona framework  a hrefhttptyphoonframework.org relnofollowTyphoona and when I open the sample project for a hrefhttpsgithub.comappsquicklyTyphoonSwiftExample relnofollowSwifta in all the classes that inherit from the ObjectiveC class codeTyphoonAssemblycode all the methods relatives to inject dependencies have the codedynamiccode modifier included in the following way p  precodepublic dynamic func weatherReportDao gt AnyObject      return TyphoonDefinition.withClassWeatherReportDaoFileSystemImpl.self  codepre  pI thought that Im missing something, but I dont understand where is the strongpolymorphic operation method or function to call at run timestrong here.p  pWhats is the purpose of the strongdynamic dispatchstrong herep
Negative 5350 psorry if I suck this is my first time posting on herep  pI am working on several dozen data centers, each with several dozen linux server and I am trying to automate the PXE boot process and do it remotely. I have designed the data centers such that each server has a single interface that is only connected to a switch that a PXE server is on.p  pCurrently this process is done manually, by using a KVM to go into the server, reboot it, jam F11 at start up, and select PXE boot, and then select that interface to boot out of.p  pEverything else Ive managed to automate, except this step. I was wondering if there was a command to do a one time PXE boot command on a server so that it will reboot and begin the PXE boot sequence automatically ie DHCP request, TFTP, ect. I have scripts to push a single command to all of my servers, I just want to push to PXE boot all of them and have the process begin so that I dont need to go to each server with a KVM and do the manual step.p  pThank youp

Negative 5350 pI am attempting to use codespatialitecode with both Python 2 and 3 on Windows 7. p  pRather than try to patch codepyspatialitecode for Python 3, I decided to use the codeloadextensioncode approach with codesqlite3code Python builtin package, similar to how is done here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq85905992741329Sqlite loadextension fail for spatialite in Pythona and here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq279078182741329Use spatialite extension for SQLite on Windowsa.p  pBut, on the official CPython 2.7 installer, the codeloadextensioncode was disabled for an issue related to MacOS. This is not with the counterpart for Python 3.4. Furthermore, both installers are built without codeSQLITEENABLERTREE1code that Id also like to have.p  pAt first, for Python 2.7, a workaround was to build codepysqlitecode tweaking the setup files to have both RTree and extensions. This way does not work for Python 3, since it does not seem to be supported by the current codesetup.pycode. From my understand, this is because the package moved to the core Python repository a hrefhttpsgithub.comghaeringpysqliteissues72issuecomment94319589 relnofollowhttpsgithub.comghaeringpysqliteissues72issuecomment94319589a p  pMy current solution was to rebuild both Python 2.7 and 3.4 with required settings for codesqlite3code package. It worked, and I was able to load codespatialitecode as an extension and to create RTree. p  pDoes it exist an alternative emsimplerem solution Did somebody find an alternative solution by working on the codesetup.pycode of codepyspatialitecode or codepysqlitecodep

However, rather than colouring it with Javascript, Id prefer to be able to give it a colour based on a class.p  pI thought it would be an ideal use case for CSS filters.

However, I am now trying to write a custom renderer so that I can change the color of events that I load into the calendar.  This process is very basically described here a hrefhttpdocs.telerik.comdevtoolsxamarincontrolscalendarhowtocalendarhowtocreatecustomrenderer relnofollowhttpdocs.telerik.comdevtoolsxamarincontrolscalendarhowtocalendarhowtocreatecustomrendererap  pHowever, this really does not go into enough detail for me to figure out why Im having the issues that Im having.  My first goal is just to get the custom renderer working at all, I can worry about the events afterwords.  My understanding is that by creating a custom view and inheriting from the base, I should have all available functionality that it would have otherwise had.  This is what I want.  I dont want to have to redefine all of the calendar functionality, only enhance what is already there.

Negative 5350 pOk, heres the scenario. We have a Symfony2 project and the same core code is shared by two websites, the 2nd website simply has its own App folder, with the src and vendor folders symlinked to the master install. This works great and with the specific parameters in the 2nd app folder, allows us to run with a different database and thus offer the same technical solution to two companies. hurrah p  pBUT. We obviously want them styled differently via CSS, the values for which need to come out of the database. I realise we could simply code them, but with future projects in mind, we want them to be in the database and thus easy to update centrally.p  pSo, the problem is how can we insert these database sourced values into the CSS file Ive looked into SASS etc, which would be a step in the right direction, but the values are still defined within the CSS file, not outside it.p  pWe could do a dynamic CSS file, powered by Twig, but thats frankly using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.p  pHas anyone come across this problem and found a suitable answerp

Negative 5350 pI am implementing the simple for clause using open mp in visual studio 2012. This implementation file is .cu file to be compiled by nvcc.

So, i doubted the for clause using omp, but its optimized correctly when use omp, from 50ms to 20ms What is the problem. I will be appreciated if you help me.p

However, I want to support Python3 as well, and although all my code works, it seems that the twistd executable is not present on the Twisted version for python 3 apparently the codetwisted.scriptscode package is not included.

Negative 5350 pI am using progress data server for oracle. Actual DB resides on ORACLE 11g and only progress schema is created with oracle DB schema and used to connect Oracle DB using orabrokers. We want Oracle to handle index selection as per execution plan, so we added noindexhint parameter for Data Server and it stopped index hints from queries which are hitting to Oracle. Now issue is even if there is no index hint, Data server is adding order by clause to SQL query using indexes matching where clause columns and their sequence.even if by clause in not used in progress query. Because of this order by coming from Data server, Oracle is forced to use different index which is taking much time. One solution here seems removing all indexes from Schema holder as in source code we are not using any explicit useindex keyword. Kindly provide your comments for handling this case.p

Negative 5350 pIm using this code to fillformat a DataGridView. The idea is, if the user checks a checkbox and later hits a save button it writes either the TrueValue or the FalseValue back to the database.  The code works fine except for an issue with the FalseValue when the DataGridView loads.  If all the values in the database are the TrueValue the DataGridView opens fine, all the checkboxes are checked.  The user can uncheck, check, whatever....then save, the appropriate TrueValue or FalseValue is written to the database accordingly.  The problem is, if there is a FalseValue in the database, when the DataGridView loads or you hold the pointer over the unchecked checkbox it raises the DataGridView Default Error Dialog.

Negative 5350 pIm new to this forum, so let me know, if I forgot any relevant info or used uncommon formattingp  pSo my problem is the following I currently write my Bachelor Thesis and for that I have to read large .ncfiles using codencreadcode. This works absolutelty fine, eventhough with some of the larger files it takes some time. I know, that I can trim the data to be read using the codestartcode and codecountcode argument in codencreadcode. p  pI wrote a function that reads two ncfiles size is 360x170x1460 located on my harddrive. The files are each 11GB big, thus at first I couldnt run the function due to excessive memory usage. I started using the codestartcode and codecountcode argument in codencreadcode which sped up the process from 6 minutes to 3 seconds.  The part I read from these files is a geographical longitude,latitude 360x170 tuple for all timesteps 1460. This works very well. p  pAfter a couple of runs, sometimes even on the first run, i get exceptionally long run times. Using the codeprofilercode I managed to identify the timeconsuming part of my function. It turns out, that the netcdfprivatenetcdflib MEXfile consumes around 357 seconds out of 360 seconds in total. p  pNow comes the weird part, depending on which coordinate tuple I want to access the script jumps from 3 seconds to 6 minutes. Example I call the function for location A, I wait 6 minutes and get the desired result. I then use codeclear allcode codeclose allcode and run the function for the same location A, but this time the run time is around 3 seconds. Then I use codeclear allcode codeclose allcode and call the function for location B and again it takes about 6 minutes of run time.  This behaviour seems to change with the way I call the function... evaluating it as a section no codeclearcode or codeclosecode or calling it from a seperate script with previous codeclearcode and codeclosecode. But the behaviour is somewhat unpredictable.p  pThis is the functionp  precodefunction [cnt]  BAHSTPlon,lat,kind,path,outpath,cnt  lon  lon  181 lat  lat  81  switch kind       case WAVE     tmp1  squeezesqueezencread[path HS19812011.nc],Hs,[lon,lat,1],[1,1,inf]     tmp2  squeezesqueezencread[path PP19812011.nc],WAVEPP,[lon,lat,1],[1,1,inf]     xstring  Combined wave peak period [s]     ystring  Combined wave significant wave height [m]    cmap  loadHistogramcmap.mat  load custom colormap, in order to show the low probability variations in the Hist   tmpp  double[tmp1,tmp2] figurecnt hist3tmpp view70,40 [n,c]  hist3tmpp cnt  cnt  1 Anzahl  sumsumn figurecnt contourfc2, c1, nAnzahl,500 setgca,ydir,reverse setgca,xaxislocation,top shading flat caxis[0 1] colormapcmap.map cb  colorbar ylabelcb,relative frequency xlabelxstring ylabelystring   output to excel xlswrite[outpath num2strlon181 East num2strlat81 North.xlsx],nAnzahl cnt  cnt  1 end  codepre  pThis is the calling scriptp  precode Hs vs Tp plot of any coordiante tuple tic ifexistcnt,var0     cnt  1 end  path  ETobiasDaten outputpath  ZStudienarbeitenKleineTobias kind  WAVE  WAVE , SEA , SWELL lon  37  deg East real, phys. coordinate lat  46  deg North real, phys. coordiante [cnt]  BAHSTPlon,lat,kind,path,outputpath,cnt toc codepre

Negative 5350 pI have an ASP.Net application that accesses user data from a SQL database.p  ul liVisual Studio Version 2012li liWindows Server 2012 Standard 6.2li liSql Server 2012li liProgram in Service since 112007 with problem having never happened previouslyli ul  pstrongProblemstrong First reported by 2 of my customers but I was not experiencing the problem until after a recent MS update.p  pUnsure of the particulars of those updates or whether it was only a coincident.p  pLog into application and go around to a few pages, all seems ok, than I select a new Active Company auto filters list screens by Active Company ID from a session variable, changing active company changes the ID stored in the session variable, everything works fine for a while 1  4 mins switching between screens and even different active companies, than at one point I go to a page that Ive been to several times that worked fine and it shows everything from the last time I accessed it  literally the identical page from a few mins ago. I change to another page and it appears to be updated, go back to the screen that did not update and it no matter what, will not update again. I query the database and it is indicating the correct active company ID and query the session variable and that too is correct.p  p The strange thing is I can wait 4 5 mins I just stop doing anything and than try to access the page again and now it updates.p  pI have been beating at this now for almost 2 weeks and have not been able to determine to source of the problem. I literally have tried every settings for session caching I could read up on with no or minimal affect. Since our software utilizes session variables to hold user variables to control their environment like active company selection, I went to go as far as removing the session variables and making the profile.variables requiring Sql Session management with minimal affect.p  pIt seems to work fine for a few minutes or page accesses than once it stops updating the page, it will no longer update under any circumstance.p  pIt will occur on pretty much any combination of page changes after changing the active company, since it will actually change data displayed.p  pThis design has been out in the field for over 8 years now and is routinely brought uptodate with the latest dot.net compiler updates, .net framework and IronSpeed Designer engine updates. This error has never occurred before now. No update to the development tools took place prior to the appearance of this issue.p  pI tried various tests. Test 1  I added java code to reset each page.p  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt   function RefreshPage        window.location.reload    ltscriptgt codepre  pResult No changep  pTest 2 I stopped as soon as the page did not refresh and started timing when the page would update 1 2 mins or going back and forth between the change active company and the reports screen several timesp  pResult After 60  90 secs, the current page seemed to do an update the activity icon would appear than go away so I would than check the page the was not refreshing and it was now correct.p  pSince I was using the report page for my tests, I would run a report when the screen update failed, to see what active company it thought it was on since it was also reliant on the session variable, it was bringing up the correct report data, even though the page was not indicating the correct active company. Note Every one of our screens indicate the current user and active company name at the top, so it is easy to see when it is not updating.p  pAny direction as to where to look from here would be greatly appreciated, emIm at a lost as to what to check nowem.p  pP.S. I installed MS Message Analyzer and had it monitor up to the point where I get a failure. I have never user MS MA before so I dont have much of an idea as to what to look for, other than the operation status was indicating Found 302 for the Get and Post and Ok 200 for the page I received the problem for.p  pThanks in advancedp  pJohn Rp

Negative 5350 pIve read through many, many posts on Apples decision to not allow autoplay on web apps and the requirement to play audio on a user interaction. Based on what Ive read of other peoples issues, I thought what I have below, though nodoubt overly complicated, should work, but the audio never plays and the body HTML class gets stuck in the talking mode. p  pWhat Im trying to do is play audio in the web browser after the user touches the screen but not immediately after they touch the screen because the file to be played is not QUITE ready at that point. I am using SignalR to indicate when the file is ready to be played. This will occur after the user touches the screen but unfortunately, it cant right after. From everything Ive read, I HAVE to play the audio in the user interaction event or it will not work. So I start playing the audio on the touchup event, then when the server triggers the function indicating that the audio is actually ready, the audio file is reloaded again and played. However...this isnt working . Im not sure if this is because of the ios limitations on audio or if Im doing something else wrong I was hoping someone might have some insight.p  pIt does work obviously to my great annoyance in simulators and regular browsers. Just not on an actual mobile device. IOS version is 8.4. Im using ASP.NET 4.5 and C on the server. Unfortunately I dont have any other physical devices to test this on simulators appear to work for other mobile browsers.p  precodelthtml xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtmlgt lthead runatservergt lttitlegtQuinnlttitlegt ltmeta nameapplemobilewebappcapable       contentyes gt  lt Make the app title different than the page title. gt ltmeta nameapplemobilewebapptitle       contentiOS 8 web appgt  lt Configure the status bar. gt ltmeta nameapplemobilewebappstatusbarstyle       contentblackgt  lt Set the viewport. gt ltmeta nameviewport       contentinitialscale1gt  lt Disable automatic phone number detection. gt ltmeta nameformatdetection       contenttelephonenogt  ltheadgt ltbody class neutralgt ltform idform1 runatservergt ltaspScriptManager IDScriptManager1 runatserver EnablePageMethodstrue gt ltdiv ideyesgtltdivgt ltdiv idmouthgtltdivgt ltdiv idoverlaygtltdivgt ltformgt ltdivgtlth2gtLoglth2gt ltpre idloggtltpregt ltdivgt ltaudio idsoundHandle styledisplaynonegtltaudiogt     ltscript srchttpscode.jquery.comjquery1.9.1.min.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript srchttpsajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjquery1.9.1jquery.min.js typetextjavascriptgtltscriptgt ltscript srcScriptsjquery.signalR2.0.0.min.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript srcsignalrhubsgtltscriptgt ltscript srcjstalk.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript srcjsaudio.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript typetextjavascriptgt      var music  document.getElementByIdsoundHandle       function for writing log data to screen     function loge, data          log.innerHTML  n  e     data              variable for tts     var delay  1500       This is called when the user puts their finger down  touch start     function handleStartevt          logSee touch start         evt.preventDefault          if document.body.className  neutral              body.removeClassneutral             body.addClassfrown             startRecording                  else              logIssue with touch start Not starting in neutral                     this is called when the user lifts their finger  touch up     function handleEndevt          logSee touch end         evt.preventDefault         var trigger  touch          if document.body.className  frown              body.removeClassfrown             body.addClassneutral              stopRecording             playMusictrigger                                 else              logIssue with touch end Not frowning                     Ajax post to server     function startRecording          .ajax             type POST,             url quinn.aspxstartR,             data bitVar 1,             contentType applicationjson charsetutf8,             dataType json,             success OnSuccess,             failure function response                  alertresponse.d                                  function stopRecording          .ajax             type POST,             url quinn.aspxstopR,             data bitVar 0,             contentType applicationjson charsetutf8,             dataType json,             success OnSuccess,             failure function response                  alertresponse.d                                 function OnSuccessresponse          logStartStop recording worked            Signal R hub  this function is triggered when the file is ready     function           var update  .connection.myHub         var trigger  signalR         update.client.playM  function               playMusictrigger                  .connection.hub.start            loads and plays the music and sets event handler for when music is done     function playMusictrigger          music.setFileattributionSound, filestransformed.wav         logCalled play music          if trigger  signalR              body.addClasstalking              Attach handlers             music.addEventListenerended, function                    When wave file stops                 body.removeClasstalking                  Remove listener                 this.removeEventListenerplay, arguments.callee, false                               music.src  filestransformed.wav         music.play         if trigger  touch              music.pause                                set event listeners for touch start and touch end events     window.onload  function init          try              document.addEventListenertouchstart, handleStart             document.addEventListenertouchend, handleEnd                  catch e              logissue with startup                ltscriptgt codepre  p p

Given the two queries I posted, why would I use a recursive CTE to solve it when I could use the same table joined to itself  It seems like I get the same information back        p  pIf it means anything, this will be run on SQL Server 2012 or 2008.p

Negative 5350 pI am trying to calculate some statistics for a moving window and am using rollapply in the zoo package.

In the above cases if the length of width is 1 then width is recycled for every byth point. If width is a list its components represent integer offsets such that the ith component of the list refers to time points at positions i  width[[i]]. But I have no idea what that means in terms of R code an no example is provided.p
Negative 5350 pI want to have several bundles Mjbundle, which essentially are bundles of questions Mjquestion. The Mjquestion has an integer index property which needs to be unique, but it should only be unique within the bundle containing it. Im not sure how to model something like this properly, I try to do it using a structured repeating property below, but there is yet nothing actually constraining the uniqueness of the Mjquestion indexes. What is a betternormalcorrect way of doing thisp  precodeclass Mjquestionndb.Model     This is a Mjquestion.     index  ndb.IntegerPropertyindexedTrue, requiredTrue     genre1  ndb.IntegerPropertyindexedFalse, requiredTrue, choices[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]     genre2  ndb.IntegerPropertyindexedFalse, requiredTrue, choices[1,2,3]     will add a bunch of more data properties later  class Mjbundlendb.Model     This is a Mjbundle.     mjquestions  ndb.StructuredPropertyMjquestion, repeatedTrue     time  ndb.DateTimePropertyautonowaddTrue codepre  pWith the above model and having fetched a certain Mjbundle entity, I am not sure how to quickly fetch a Mjquestion from mjquestions based on the index. The explanation on filtering on structured properties looks like it works on the Mjbundle type level, whereas I already have a Mjbundle entity and was not sure how to quickly query only on the questions contained by that entity, without looping through them all manually in code.p  pSo Im open to any suggestion on how to do this better.p  ul lipI read this informational answer a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma3855751129202httpstackoverflow.coma3855751129202a It gives some thoughts about scalability and on a related note I will be expecting just a couple of bundles but each bundle will have questions in the thousands.pli lipMaybe I should not use the mjquestions property of Mjbundle at all, but rather focus on parenting each Mjquestion created should have a certain Mjbundle entity as parent. And then manually enforce uniqueness at insert time by doing an ancestor query.pli ul

Negative 5350 pI am developing an application that uses Windows Workflow. One area of the workflow uses a Parallel.ForEach activity that runs a AsyncCodeActivity. You can see this in the screenshot below. The RunPolicyWorkflow Activity is an AsyncCodeActivity. p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comOtzFC.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comOtzFC.png altenter image description hereap  pFrom what I understand from the Windows Workflow documentation is that this will create new threads as needed to operate on the collection that is being enumerated in the ParalleForEach Activity. p  pI have around 16000 items in the Parallel Loop. Inside the loop during the RunPolicyWorkflow Activity I am doing a little CPU work, but most of the time is spent saving the results to a SQL Server Instance. When using Resource Monitor to keep an eye on my process, I noticed that there were around 2,000 threads in this process that was running the workflow. p  pIt looks like my application is getting slower the more threads it creates. My computer only has 8 logical processors so Im pretty sure this isnt great optimization. p  pDoes anyone know of a way to limit the amount of threads that Windows Workflow is creating Or does anyone have any suggestions on a way that this could be done better All the items in the Parallel loop are independent from each other and I want to process all of the items in the collection 16000 as fast as possible. Initially Its processing at about 300 items per minute but lows down to about 60 items per minute as the thread count gets higher and more items have been processed.p
Negative 5350 pI am wondering if there is any way I can send data from a python script I am writing on a mac to an ios app I was thinking I can access my macs bluetooth but am not sure if thats even possible. p
Negative 5350 pI have created a batch file to help me write a script for an application I have on my phone that will automate touch tasks. The script Iam creating will require 240x9 lines of the scripting language to complete the tasks I am wanting to complete, is there a way to open a new cmd line and output text to the new windowp  pSo for instance right now I have each option in the batch file to write the screen touch coordinates required by the scripting language to execute my tasks out to a text file like this.p  precodeECHO startgtspeedsearch.txt codepre  pIs it possible to pass these to a new window just to use it as a live log so if I loose my place I can refer to the log window to remind myself where I am in the creation of my scriptp
