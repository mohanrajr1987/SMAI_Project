Positive 834 pUpon attempting to export a schema diagram for use in a database, I am met with an errorp  pCould not save to file CIS235.sql Failed to create file CIS235.sql.XTM25X Permission deniedp  pIs it a possibility that this error is a result of conflicting user or permission settings   Ive tweaked most options around and havent had any successful results.p  pInterestingly enough, I am able to click the Save to Other File button and save it to an alternate location and then gain access to the script file.p  pBut I dont feel that this is the correct way to utilize this function Id like to be able to access the diagram directly within the connections under the schema pane.  Im not able to do that due to this error.p  pAny ideas are appreciated.  Thanks.p

Positive 834 pOur system is running on Ubuntu, python 3.4, postgres 9.4.x and psycopg2.p  pWe will in the furture split between codedevcode, codetestcode and codeprodcode environments using schemas. Ive create a convenience method for creating connections to our database. It uses json connection configuration files in order create the connection string. I want to configure the connection to use a particular schema for all following queries using the returned connection. I dont want my queries to have hardcoded schemas, because we should be able to easily switch between them depending on if we are in development, testing or production phaseenvironment.p  pCurrently the convenience method looks like the followingp  precodedef connectconnconfigfile  Commonsconfigconncommons.json     with openconnconfigfile as configfile             connconfig  json.loadconfigfile      conn  psycopg2.connect         dbname  connconfig[dbname]             user  connconfig[user]             host  connconfig[host]             password  connconfig[password]             port  connconfig[port]             cur  conn.cursor     cur.executeSET searchpath TO   connconfig[schema]      return conn codepre  pIt works fine as long as you give it time to execute the set codesearchpathcode query. Unfortunately, if Im too fast with executing a following query a race condition happens where the codesearchpathcode isnt set. Ive tried to force the execution with doing a codeconn.commitcode before the codereturn conncode, however, this resets the codesearchpathcode to the default schema codepostgrescode so that it doesnt use, say, codeprodcode. Suggestions at the database or application layer is preferable, however, I know we probably could solve this at the OS level too, any suggestions in that direction are also welcomed. p  pAn example json configuration file looks like the followingp  precode     dbname thedatabase,     user theuser,     host localhost,     password theuserssecretpassword,     port 6432,     schema prod  codepre  pAny suggestion is very appreciated.p
Positive 834 pI am using parse.com for the backend of my new iOSandroid game. The way users join games is they select the type of lobby they want to join, for examplep  pApplep  pOrangep  pLemonp  pThe user would select one of the lobby types, and the app will query for lobbies of that type with LESS THAN 4 users in it Array of users. If it finds one, it will add the user to it, if not I will create a new lobby with the user as the first person in the lobby.p  pMy question is how do I ensure that, however unlikely, when 2 users both search for the Apple lobby, and an object with 3 users is returned, they both dont get added into the lobby I need to ensure that the game stays at 4 players or less, and that only one of them gets added to the lobby, and the next one gets added to a new lobby. Is there a way to check if another user is currently modifying an object What would be the best way to go about thisp

Positive 834 pIve just finished two days of agilescrum coaching at work which was great. Im a a novice to professional programming so I needed it. However, Im struggling very much with the notion of vertical slicing. In particular I cannot see how a database schema can emerge from several developers working separately across all development tiers front middle and back Designing the database schema all in one go is called horizontal slicing and its considered a nono. Im familiar with object relational mapping  slightly  from having worked with frameworks like Grails. But again, I still designed the schema first and worked from there. p  pTo be clear, I am not arguing against the case for agilescrumvertical slicing, rather I am asking how it is possible  in particular when it comes the mapping of objects the the database schema, how can this be done by several developers in tandem and not from the beginningp  pThis article which i really like seems to  if ive read it correctly  suggest that the database schema should be designed in the spring planning stage before any user stories are implemented.a hrefhttpwww.vertabelo.comblognotesfromthelabdatamodelinginagiledevelopmentonedatamodelersexperience relnofollowhttpwww.vertabelo.comblognotesfromthelabdatamodelinginagiledevelopmentonedatamodelersexperienceap

Positive 834 pIve been reading up on XML et al but Im just not seeing the big picture.p  pIm writing an application which needs to submit XML OAGIS BODS, to our middleware INFOR ION for processing. Much as Ive tried theres no get me started or best practice guide for what I want to do.p  pI have been given a golden sample of a populated XML and told which tags and attributes I should replace or add to when I create an instance of my own XML. In essence this golden sample is the only documentation I have The sample is just a file Ive been given and so is just a snapshot of the XML when I received it.p  pAt the crudest level, I could just use XMLreader and XMLwriter to trawl through my golden sample and modifyadd to any XML Im interested in. Great It works, but I cant help thinking this is all wrong. Most significantly because, I suspect the schema used for the XML could change without notice and my code would not honour these changes. The middleware however would honour the schema and would reject my populated sample as being invalid against it.p  pHeres my thinking on what I should REALLY be doing. Please could you tell me if Im on the right lines or how I might better approach the problemp  pAs I see it, I should be somehow using the schema to drive the creation and population process, thus keeping my XML uptodate and compliant. The schema should be my friend, but Im not quite sure how. I feel I should somehow be reading the schema to dynamically create objects with methods and properties such that I can only ever populate with syntactically correct tags and attributes. So my pseudo code would read something likep  pdim x as new XMLfromSchemaa hrefhttpsomeplace...xsd relnofollowhttpsomeplace...xsdap  px.purchaseOrderNumber  REQ000001p  px.purchaseItem1.desc  New Penp  px.purchaseItem1.price  2.99p  px.purchaseItem2.desc  XML Spyp  px.purchaseItem2.price  500.00p  px.saveXMLcrats.xmlp  pIn accordance with the schema, the XMLfromSchema class may well raise errors when I fail to populate any fields without defaults or give invalid data.p  pIt seems xsd.exe now paste special in VS2012 and XML Spy could create these classes, but theyre not dynamic.p  pI suppose Im asking. Should I be crude and just code up every node and attribute disregarding the schema as I go Or is there a better wayp  pBy the way, Im coding in Lotus Notes, but Im happy to get confortable creating XMLs in VS to begin with where the tools will be superior.p  pThanksp

Positive 834 pI am working on two schemas in an Oracle database, say Schema A and Schema B. I am given a task of moving all the user objects in schema A to Schema B. Some of the objects more than 200 including procedures, functions, tables and indexes have common names in both the schemas. Among the objects with common names, few are exactly similar in both definition and quite a lot have different definitions. Some of these objects in both the schemas are being called from Java layer of the application.p  pI was thinking I would declare synonyms for all the common objects in schema A and then test if my application is working properly and once this process is done make changes to the objects with common names in schema B where ever applicable and then alter my synonyms to point to objects in schema B and test again.Is there any better way to go about with this taskp  pThanks a lot in advance.p

Positive 834 pI had originally created a schema for myself which consisted of a new object class and a new attribute. Which after importing in to ApacheDS was usable and I had no errors.p  pHowever I have found that I need to edit the schema, and add two new attributes and updating the object class to include them. I created the updated schema definition via the schema editor, and exported it to LDIF with no issues.p  pHowever when I try to import it, the two new attributes were created, but the object class was not updated. The error message was along the lines of update rejected but no real information I am attempting to reproduce to get the full error once againp  pHowever I was able to modify the object call via DirStudio and add the two attributes to the ObjectClass, and i received no errors.  But now when I try to create a new user the object class no longer is available to me.

Negative 834 pMy company is in education industry and we use XML to store course content. We also store some course related information mostly metainfo in relational database. Right now we are in the process of switching from our proprietary XML Schema to DocBook 5. Along with the switch we want to move course related information from database to XML files. The reason for this is to have all course data in one place and to put it under Subversion. However, we would like to keep flexibility of the relational database and be able to easily extract specific information about a course from an XML document. XQuery seems to be up to the task so I was researching databases that supports it but so far could not find what I needed. What I basically want, is to have my XML files in a certain directory structure and then on top of this I would like to have a system that would index my files and let me select anything out of any file using XQuery. This way I can have my cake and eat it too I will have XQuery interface and still keep my files in plain text and versioned. Is there anything out there at least remotely resembling to what I want p  pIf you think that what I an asking for is nonsense please make an alternative suggestion. p  pOn the related note What XML Databases preferably native and open source do you have experience with and what would you recommendp

Negative 834 pI am in charge of a website at work and recently I have added ajaxy requests to make it faster and more responsive. But it has raised an issue.p  pOn my pages, there is an index table on the left, like a menu. Once you have clicked on it, it makes a request that fills the rest of the page. At anytime you can click on another item of the index to load a different page.p  pBefore adding javascript, it was possible to middle click open new tabs for each item of the index, which allowed to have other pages loading while I was dealing with one of them. But since I have changed all the links to be ajax requests, they now execute some javascript instead of being real links. So they are only opening empty tabs when I middle click on them.p  pIs there a way to combine both functionalities links firing javascript when left clicked or new tabs when middle clicked Does it have to be some ugly javascript that catches every clicks and deal with them accordinglyp  pThanks.p

Negative 834 pGood morning, all. This is my first question on stackoverflow, so hopefully this isnt something thats been beaten to death and I havent been able to find it.p  pIm developing an application that is going to be distributed shrinkwrapped. We have gotten the rights to distribute SQL Server 2008 Express Edition with our application, but exactly HOW to do this is a little more difficult. Right now were using a standard Visual Studio setup project, and I was obviously hoping for something very easy, like a configurable merge module, but obviously no such thing exists or I wouldnt be posting here p  pThe road I had started going down was to include the selfextracting EXE with our package, then use a custom install action to extract it and pass command line arguments to the SQL installer to create our named instance. Heres where the problem comes in.p  pExtraction is fine. I can run the script from Windows and it installs SQL Server just as it should, but I cant run the SQL installer from my custom action because its saying that there is already another installation in progress. This other installation is, of course, my application, and it isnt going to end until SQL Server finishes, so were essentially at a deadlock until SQL finally gives up and errors out.p  pWhat I WANT is a named instance of SQL server for my application that is installed with it and gets uninstalled with it. Writing my own installer is not an option because of time, and my coworker says InstallShield is not an option because of complexity Ive never used it, so Ill take his word for it. Does anyone have any thoughtsp

So far, I havent really found a good way to do that in ActionScript without adding, removing or modifying styles for the button.p  pIs there a nice way to simply tell the button to hide the PopUp togglep  pstrongPSstrong In my specific example, YES it might be easier if I just used a toggle button.  However, I want to reuse this button when dealing with an Array of objects.  If I have more than one, the property could be true and false at the same time.  In that case, I want to show the menu so they can choose what option to set all the objects properties to.p

Negative 834 pI am working on a program in WPF for the first time. I have a ListView in GridView mode displaying data from a bound dataset which is grabbed from a database.p  pIn my database, date of birth is not a required field. As such, any record without a dob had the value set to codeDateTime.MinValuecode. On each of these minimum value dates, the date shows in the cell as 01010001. I am trying to find a way to either format the cell so that codeDateTime.MinValuecode doesnt show, or replace each codeMinValuecode with codecode. p  pMy thought was to either use the Loaded event of the textblock the date is in and replace each instance of 01010001, or loop through the dataset before sending it to the GridView and removereplace them there.

Negative 834 pI have built a CMS system using jQuery and PHP, it has worked consistently for multiple users across different platforms over the past year or so.  p  pToday as I was presenting it to a potential customer over the phone he ran into a problem in Internet Explorer 8, for some reason he was not able to log in to the system so I created a dirty hack to allow him in without authorizing, this allowed him to see the interface, but again, all features were still broken when it came to XMLHttpRequests, this puzzled me so I guided him through a Firefox 3.6 install over the phone with the same result, I have since checked with friends and family at remote locations and across platforms and they seem to be able to do everything he could not I have run out of ideas, so here is the questionbr Has anyone ever run into this same problem and how did you solve itp  pstrongUpdatestrong I know JavaScript works, some of the other features works as intended, I have also checked for lingering console.log etc that could screw up the results, its all clear.p

Negative 834 pIn a scrum team, how important is it to complete a single story before moving onp  pOur scrum master is fairly dogmatic about bringing a single story to completion before moving on. I can see that development would appear to be more controlled in this scenario, plus the scrum master would have a very accurate picture of what team members were working on at any given time... but I am interested in what this really buys usp  pClearly the scrum master wants to minimise divergence of the burndown from reality to avoid a shock come the end of the sprint  but surely if the sprint is two weeks long, the burndown is updated consistently and blockers are communicated at standups  any such divergence will be constrained by the sprint length, and be made visible midsprint through the usual channels i.e. the standup or speaking to the scrum master individually. Any remaining issues can be dealt with in the fortnightly retrospective.p  pThe reason for the question is that I seem to find I work most efficiently by keeping say 2 or 3 if one is particularly easy stories in progress at any given time which I work on as I see fit. This seems to assist with the subconscious background thought that assists with completion of the task. It also permits me to better understand the bigger picture if a couple of stories are related.p  pOur stories usually work out to be one or two days worth of work.p  pSo, is working on a couple stories at a time frowned upon and if so what does onestoryatatime buy youp

Negative 834 pFirstly this has turned out to be quite a long post so please bear with me as its not too difficult but you may need to clarify something with me if i havent explained it correctly. So with some help the other day from guys on this forum, i managed to partially set up my mapClass class, but im having trouble with it and its not running correctly so i would like some help if possible. I will post the code below so you can see.p  pWhat Ive got is a Dundrum class which sets up the listView for an array of items.p  pThen ive got a dundrumSelector class which I use to set up the setOnClickListener methods on the listItems and link them to their correct views.p  pTHIS IS MY DUNDDRUM SELECTOR CLASS....p  precode    public static final int BUTTON1  R.id.anandaAddressButton public static final int BUTTON2  R.id.bramblesCafeAddressButton public static final int BUTTON3  R.id.brannigansAddressButton codepre  blockquote   ppublic void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState           super.onCreatesavedInstanceStatep blockquote  precode    int position  getIntent.getExtras.getIntposition      ifposition  0         setContentViewR.layout.ananda          ifposition  1         setContentViewR.layout.bramblescafe          ifposition  2         setContentViewR.layout.brannigans codepre  blockquote precodeButton anandabutton  Button findViewByIdR.id.anandaAddressButton anandabutton.setOnClickListenernew View.OnClickListener  codepre blockquote  precode    public void onClickView view          Intent myIntent  new Intentview.getContext,MapClass.class         myIntent.putExtrabutton, BUTTON1         startActivityForResultmyIntent,0          Button bramblesbutton  Button findViewByIdR.id.bramblesCafeAddressButton bramblesbutton.setOnClickListenernew View.OnClickListener       public void onClickView view          Intent myIntent  new Intentview.getContext,MapClass.class         myIntent.putExtrabutton, BUTTON2         startActivityForResultmyIntent, 0        codepre  petc etc....p  pThen what i did was set up static ints to represent the buttons which you can see at the top of this class, the reason for this is because in my mapClass activity I just want to have one method, because the only thing that is varying is the coordinates to each location. ie. i dont want to have 100 map classes essentially doing the same thing other than different coordinates into the method.p  pSo my map class is as follows...p  precodecase DundrumSelector.BUTTON1         handleCoordinates53.288719,6.241179         break     case DundrumSelector.BUTTON2         handleCoordinates53.288719,6.241179         break     case DundrumSelector.BUTTON3         handleCoordinates53.288719,6.241179         break           private void handleCoordinatesString l, String b       mapView  MapView findViewByIdR.id.mapView     LinearLayout zoomLayout  LinearLayoutfindViewByIdR.id.zoom     View zoomView  mapView.getZoomControls      zoomLayout.addViewzoomView,             new LinearLayout.LayoutParams                 LayoutParams.WRAPCONTENT,                  LayoutParams.WRAPCONTENT          mapView.displayZoomControlstrue      mc  mapView.getController     String coordinates[]  l, b     double lat  Double.parseDoublecoordinates[0]     double lng  Double.parseDoublecoordinates[1]      p  new GeoPoint             int lat1E6,             int lng1E6      mc.animateTop     mc.setZoom17     mapView.invalidate    codepre  pNow this is where my problem is. The onClick events dont even work from the listView to get into the correct views. I have to comment out the methods in DundrumSelector before I can get into their views.p  pAnd this is what I dont understand, firstly why wont the onClick events work, because its not even on that next view where the map is.p  pI know this is a very long post and it might be quite confusing so let me know if you want any clarification..p  pJust to recap, what im trying to do is just have one class that sets up the map coordinates, like what im trying to do in my mapClass.p  pPlease can someone help or suggest another way of doing this  Thanks alot everyone for reading this.p

Negative 834 pTheres a data structure called treap thats a randomized binary search tree, which is also a heap on randomly generated socalled priorities.p  pTheres a variation of this structure, where keys are implicit, they arent stored in the tree, but we consider the ordered index of the node in the tree as this nodes key. We need to store size of subtree in each node instead of key. This technique enables us to think about treap like some kind of array, which supports lots of operation in Olog N time insertion, deletion, reversion of subarray, changing on interval and so on.p  pI know a bit about this structure, but no so much. I tried to google it, but Ive found only lots of articles about treap itself, but nothing about this implicit treap  indexed list. I even dont know its name, because my native language isnt English and lecture Ive listened used the native term of structure, not English original term. This native term can be directly translated in English as Treap on the implicit keys or Cartesian tree on the implicit keys.p  pCan anybody point me at the article about this structure or tell me its original name Thank you.p  pP.S. Sorry if my English wasnt understandable enough.p  pstrongUPDstrong Some extra explanation about structure Im looking for.p  pConsider a usual treap with randomly chosen priorities and keys, which are actual user data stored in the tree. Then lets imagine we have some other user info stored in every node, and keys are nothing but the search keys. Next step is calculating and maintaining the subtree size in each node we have to update this parameter after every MergeSplitAddRemove, but it allows us to find, for example, Kth element of the tree in Olog N time.p  pWhen we have subtree sizes in each node, we can throw keys away and imagine that treap represents an array of user data in inorder traversal. Array index of each element can be easily calculated from subtree sizes. Now we can addremove an element in the middle of array or split this array  all in Olog N time.p  pWe can also make multiple operation  for example, add a constant value to all elements of our array. To implement this, we have to make this operation delayed, add a parameter in every node that represents a delayed constant which has to be later added to all the elements of this nodes subarray, and push the changes up to down as necessary. Adding a constant to subarray or painting marking the subarray can be made delayed in this way, as reversing the subarray here the delayed info in the node in the bit subarray has to be reversed, and so on.p  pstrongUPD2strong Heres a hrefhttpsites.google.comsiteindy256algotreapimplicitcode snippeta  piece of the small amount of information Ive found. Dont notice cyrillic  Words    mean in direct translation with implicit key.p

Negative 834 pLinux has a feature called a hrefhttpwww.ibm.comdeveloperworkslinuxlibrarylmountnamespaces.html relnofollownamespacesa, which let you give a different view of the filesystem to different processes.  In Windows terms, this would be useful for example if you had a legacy program floyd that always loaded its configuration from codeCfloydfloyd.inicode.  If Windows had namespaces, you could write a wrapper script which would create a namespace in which to run codefloydcode, making it so when Alice ran the script, floyd would start up in an environment where codeCfloydcode existed but actually pointed to codeCUsersAliceFloydcode.p  pNow you may be thinking, OK, just use soft or hard links and make codeCfloydcode an alias for codeCUsersAlicecode.  But with namespaces, Bob can also run the startup script, but his instance of floyd on the same computer, running at the same time will see codeCfloydcode with the contents of, say, codeCUsersBobProgram SettingsFloyd Configcode or any other path we like.p  pYou can do this on Linux with namespaces.  Is there something similar or analogous on Windows  Its fine if it requires writing a C program, and its OK if it only works on recent versions of Windows.p

Negative 834 pIm currently fiddling around with Android programming, but I have a small problem detecting different touch events, namely a normal touch press press on the screen and release right away, a long press touch the screen and hold the finger on it and movement dragging on the screen.p  pWhat I wanted to do is have an image of a circle on my screen which I can drag around. Then when I press it once shortnormal press a Toast comes up with some basic information about it. When I long press it, an AlertDialog with a list comes up to select a different image circle, rectangle or triangle.p  pI made a custom View with my own OnTouchListener to detect the events and draw the image in onDraw.

But I have a feeling this isnt really the way to go.p  pI also havent found out how to detect a long press. The culprit really is the MOVE which seems to always trigger.p  pFor an example of what I roughly want, see the Android application DailyStrip it shows an image of a comic strip. You can drag it if its too large for the screen. You can tap it once for some controls to popup and long press it for an options menu.p  pPS.

Negative 834 pHallo everyone,p  pstackoverflow has always been a good resource for programming related questions. This is the first time I ask a question by mysqlf, as I absolutely cant find a good solution. So please forgive me if I forgot anything  Im willing to learn p  pIve used JS and jQuery for a long time now. The benefit of jQuery is, that there are lots of resources and plugins for various needs you can use out of the box. However, I see lots of websites using quite nice form elements Styled inputs for textpassword, radio, checkboxes, dropdowns, etc. But I couldnt find any jQuery plugin or JavaScript framework, which provides the possibility to designstyle form elements. Either they lack of element support or theyre very unstable.p  ul lijQuery UI which Ive recently started to use doesnt support textinputs and drop down menus.li liNiceForms is quite neat, but its a little bit unstable in some browsers and rather hacky. It replaces some elements with various absolute positioned divs, which sometimes completely destroys my layout or just doesnt work while floating etc.. Also it lacks lots of basic attributes like the width of some elements.li ul  pIm looking for a way to style them graphically. So I dont want to just modify its borders via CSS. Do you know any resources, I can use for that Id code it myself, but Im a bit afraid of the huge work, as it can be very nervewracking to make customized form fields work on all the common browsers.p  pDoes anyone know some other still maintained or stable approaches than jQuery UI and NiceFormsp

Negative 834 pstrongBackgroundstrong Ive got a free app that is adsupported.  The basic idea is that when the app is launched, ad content HTML is downloaded from the server in the background, and only if the download was successful, then the content is being shown.p  pstrongPrevious solutionstrong I have implemented this successfully in a universal app.  Originally, I loaded a codeNSDatacode variable with an URL, and if it was successful, then I presented a modal view which contained an codeUIWebViewcode relevant code is in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5123266uiwebviewactsdiffernetlyinappstoreversionthandevversionanother questiona. The problem is that the external assets images dont get loaded in the original codeNSDatacode request, so in a stroke of genius I thought of another wayp  pstrongNew solutionstrong The new way, and this is what I want help with, is that Im instantiating the modal view controller without displaying it yet, and having the web view begin loading the URL directly.  When the codewebViewDidFinishLoadcode method is called, I fire a notification back to the parent which then performs the codepresentModalViewControllercode.p  pHere are the methods which instantiate the view controller and present it modallyp  precode voidlaunchAd      if [ServerCheck serverReachableopenx.freewavewifi.com hideAlertYES]              [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserverself selectorselectorpresentAdModal nameAdLoaded objectnil]          AdViewController adView  [[AdViewController alloc] initWithNibNamenil bundlenil]         [[adView view] awakeFromNib] THIS LINE IS WHAT THIS QUESTION IS ABOUT          navController  [[UINavigationController alloc] initWithRootViewControlleradView]         [adView release], adView  nil          [navController setModalPresentationStyleUIModalPresentationFormSheet]         [navController setModalTransitionStyleUIModalTransitionStyleCoverVertical]         [[navController navigationBar] setTintColor[UIColor colorWithRed0.94 green0.00 blue0.32 alpha1.00]]          else         LogErrorNot presenting ad.    voidpresentAdModal      LogInfoPresenting advertisement modal.

However, it took a long time for me to figure out how to cause the view controller delegate methods in the codeAdViewcode controller to fire embeforeem calling codepresentModalViewControllercode.  I did this by adding code[[adView view] awakeFromNib]code, but I know this isnt the right way to make this happen.p  pSo, everything above does work beautifully, effectively having the view controller and its codeUIWebViewcode preload before displaying it.  I just want to know what I should be doing instead of code[[adView view] awakeFromNib]code  I want to do it the right way.p  pOr is this right  I guess some folks would say If it works, then its right, but I know this isnt true.p

Negative 834 pI am working on my bc thesis project which should be a Minecraft server written in scala and Akka. The server should be easily deployable in the cloud or onto a cluster not sure whether i use proper terminology...it should run on multiple nodes. I am, however, newbie in akka and i have been wondering how to implement such a thing. The problem im trying to figure out right now, is how to share state among actors on different nodes. My first idea was to have an Camel actor that would read tcp stream from minecraft clients and then send it to load balancer which would select a node that would process the request and then send some response to the client via tcp. Lets say i have an AuthenticationService implementing actor that checks whether the credentials provided by user are valid. Every node would have such actoror perhaps more of them and all the actors should have exactly same database or state of users all the time. My question is, what is the best approach to keep this state I have came up with some solutions i could think of, but i havent done anything like this so please point out the faultsp  pSolution 1 Keep state in a database. This would probably work very well for this authentication example where state is only represented by something like list of username and passwords but it probably wouldnt work in cases where state contains objects that cant be easily broken into integers and strings. p  pSolution 2 Every time there would be a request to a certain actor that would change its state, the actor will, after processing the request, broadcast information about the change to all other actors of the same type whom would change their state according to the info send by the original actor. This seems very inefficient and rather clumsy. p  pSolution 3 Having a certain node serve as sort of a state node, in which there would be actors that represent the state of the entire server. Any other actor, except the actors in such node would have no state and would ask actors in the state node everytime they would need some data. This seems also inefficient and kinda faultnonproof.p  pSo there you have it. Only solution i actually like is the first one, but like i said, it probably works in only very limited subset of problems when state can be broken into redis structures. Any response from more experienced gurus would be very appriciated. Regards, Tomas Hermanp

Negative 834 pIm developing an application using WCF Ria services and Silverlight. Performance and scalability is a must in this project.

Negative 834 pI am planning to create a website using ASP.NET and SQL Server.  However, my plan for the database design leaves me wondering if there is a better way.p  pThe website will serve as a repository of information for various users.  I figure I would have two databases, a Membership and Profile database.p  pThe profile database would contain user data for all users, where each user may have 20 tables.

The tables are not directly related.p  pFor Example a set of tables for two different users could look likep  precodeUser1 Tables  TransactionTableKey1, AssetTableKey1, ResearchTableKey1 .... User2 Tables  TransactionTableKey2, AssetTableKey2, ResearchTableKey2 ....  codepre  pThe Key1, Key2 etc.. values would be retrieved based on the MembershipID data when the account was created.  This could result in a very large number of tables over time.  Im not sure if this will limit scalability by setting up the database in this way.

Negative 834 pMy sIFR 3 font replacement is working great in FF and IE except when I use it on a services page that has an unrelated Flash object feature at the bottom. Only the first sIFR3ed element shows up in IE on this page. I am also using jQuery 1.2.6 on this page to bring up random content. It is a windows xp pc. p  pIn IE, the html on the servicespage sIFRed elements has become garbled in the browser as I see when I view the source. Things like this nodeIndex1 and jQuery13075659457014 are added to the ul and li elements and should not be. The class sIFRreplaced is not being added from sIFR like it is supposed to be. p  pThe jQuery does not interfere with sIFR3 font replacement on my other pages because they dont have the extra Flash file on the bottom. The Flash file is a shockwave cab file, version 9,0,0,0 that I did not add.p  pI see this error in the console  match....1 is null or not an object but I got this same error elsewhere and it wasnt affecting anything. p  pIm really stuck on this one.

Negative 834 pIn JUnit you can use Ignore before methods to tell the test runner to automatically skip those tests.  From what I can gather, this is really only a convenient way to documentmark off incompleteno longer functional tests that you want to get back to later.p  pAm I correct in saying then, that at runtime there is no difference between an Ignore test, a method with no annotation, and a commented out method  Assuming these tests are all self contained.  Is there some way to obtain a list of the ignored test cases in JUnit on Netbeans  If not, how much usefulness does the Ignore tag really have, since it might be more useful to fail the test so its not overlookedp

Negative 834 pIm trying to write a PHP function which will generate supposedly random strings which need to be unique regardless of the number of times it is run.

If I want to duplicate this store the string with a Unique KEY in a MySQL database, without having to repeating select and ensure that the key does not already exist is there any way At the same time, the importance of random does exist, so Id rather not go 1,2,3 aaaaa,aaaab,aaaac as this would completely nullify the need for randomness.p  pI know there is 525 different possibilities but just for educational purposes and future algorithm writing, is there an efficient method to generate these unique random stringsp  p[EDIT] I understand that uniquerandom is basically impossible. But is there any way I can generate unique, nonobvious strings Thanks danishgoelp

Negative 834 pI am working on a school project explains my restrictions in the question. My question is how to implement locks without semaphores in NACHOS. Although a NACHOS specific answer would be great, what I am looking for is a push in the right direction. So far, from my understanding, monitors use locks which use semaphores mutexes really. Initially we thought to replace semaphores with monitors to implement locks, however, that didnt make sense. p

Negative 834 pI tend to find answers before I need to post a question here, but today I cant seem to find out what is wrong.p  pWere using Doctrine 2.1.2 in a Symfony 2 app, and in a repository we have two methods that use almost the same query. The only difference between method A and method B is that there is a condition added to a JOIN that is common to both queries.p  pThe problem is that Doctrine seems to use the same result cache for both queries. When we call method A, method B uses the cache from A, and the other way around.p  pI have been using expireResultCachetrue and useResultCachefalse, to no avail.p  pHeres what the queries look likep  precode method A  SELECT DISTINCT a, b, c FROM MyBundleObjectA a INDEX BY a.id LEFT JOIN a.fkObjectB b LEFT JOIN a.fkObjectC c   method B SELECT DISTINCT a, b, c FROM MyBundleObjectA a INDEX BY a.id LEFT JOIN a.fkObjectB b WITH b.somefield IS NULL LEFT JOIN a.fkObjectC c codepre  pWhen I use getSQL, I see that they result in different queries as expected. The generated queries, when run independantly in database, do generate different results.p  pThis leads me to believe that it may be an annoying result cache bug, where Doctrine does not cache the conditions for JOINs, but only the table names.p  pIs this a bug, or is there something I can dop  pstrongEDITstrong Still happening in Doctrine 2.1.6.p

I found tooltip setting coderelative truecode, which is supposed to solve my problem it uses jQuery position instead of offset to set the tooltip position. This would work fine, if I did not have overflow auto this cannot be changed either. When you scroll the container and then click on help icon the tooltip gets the position relative to the container, but does not take the scroll into account. It results in misplaced tooltips.p  pDoes anyone know how to fix thisp  pBonus question when you click on the tooltip for the first time you get the configured animation.

Negative 834 pIm using LibSVM in Java fwiw to classify text samples into one of two categories english or spanish language. Im training on three texts in each language, for a total of roughly 50,000 words each. Im then testing on a number of shorter texts and checking for appropriate classification. Some of the testing data is drawn from the training data trivial, but essentially done as a sanity check and the rest is new.p  pTo build the SVM vectors, I have been parsing text into ngrams, and then hashing these ngrams to get numerical representations. For instance, the following vectorp  precode2.0 19.0 23.0 31.0 47.0 54.0 ... codepre  pwith label 2 implies 9 ngrams hashed to value 1, 3 ngrams hashed to value 2, and so on.p  pThis has been working well for me when using unigrams, but for some reason as soon as I switch to bigrams or higher order ngrams, classification entirely fails. Can you think of any reason why this might be the case The size of my feature set is bounded at 4999 ie. I mod each hash so that it is no bigger than 4999. Ive tried increasing and decreasing this bound but to no avail.p  pDoes anybody know where the problem might be coming from Might my corpora be too small, or is it a problem with my approach to tokenization  building feature vectorsp  pThanks in advance for your help.p

I have currently set up scheduled tasks on all of the servers because we use a network time service so they are in synchronisation.p  pI then need to run the Powershell scripts one after the other, i.e. when the script on Server1 finishes, the script on Server2 begins, then when it finishes, Server3 begins, etc.  This could be done in the same way as Part 1, i.e. scheduled tasks, however the tasks take massively varying lengths of time to complete.p  pI want to avoid the scheduled tasks option for the batch files, even though the time is in sync, I would rather have them all kick off from one place.  Finally I need suggestions on how to go about invoking the Powershell scripts in a queuelike manner across different servers.

Negative 834 pIm creating a style that targets a button. The buttons that the style will be applied against have an image and a textblock in a stack panel inside of them. Im looking to use a trigger to affect the properties of the child controls based upon certain condtions.p  pI would like to use the button style to be able to affect the stackpanels orientation as well as the images defined width.p  pIve looked throught the various child control types that are available in the property intellisence of the style setter... I can see things like Grid, DockPanel and TextBlock... but the ones that Im looking for are very noticable in their absence.p  pIs there a reason when I cant affect certain child control types Is there any way to do so without rolling a custom control which explicitly exposes the child control properties that Im looking to affectp

Negative 834 pIm currently displaying pics in my app from twitters default image service since they get included in the json response but Id like to try to get images from yfrog, twitpic, lockerz or similar providers.p  pIm using the rest api so I was thinking about adding codefilterlinkscode to the search query, extract the url from the tweet and check if the link is an image but Im not sure exactly how to get the url since I assume itll require some regular expressions plus most of the tweets url are shortened versions that redirect to the actual photo somewhere so I believe this could be a problem. Itd be nice if I could verify that the url contains any of the image providers mentioned above too kind of like a first filter before checking if the url is an imagep  pCould someone point me in the right direction Thanks in advancep

But I would like to know, why HPT can not preempt LPT If you will read the section 3.3 Unbounded Inversion, It says if LPT has acquired the resource, same time if HPT is ready but blocked because of LPT. But if MPT is ready then it preempts the LPT and executes itself. Then LPT has to wait till MPT finishes. Once MPT finishes then LPT resumes. And once LPT finishes then HPT starts. So my question is why cant HPT preempt LPT or MPTp

Negative 834 pIf a variable is a codebooleancode or a codecharcode in CC or a codebytecode in some language like Java  no wait Javas on a VM and the CPU uses words larger than 1 byte, isnt space wasted I heard when the variable is stored in memory it can be stored more compact for example 1 byte even though a word is 4 bytes.

Negative 834 pI like to use Win32, even in the age of .Net, MFC and touch. My coworker said to me that it might not be possible to use the Win32 API in future versions of Windows After Windows 9 , because Microsoft might deprecate it. p  pHowever, this seems impossible to me, because windows itself uses so much of that API. If they got rid of the low level Win32 C library, the operating system would itself stop working, and they would have to recode a great portion of the Operating System Not to mention all the code that would be broken. p  pAnyway, I dont know much about this stuff, does anyone have any technical understanding on if this is impossible or not p  pAlso, note that Im strongemnotemstrong asking if windows emwillem deprecate the low level API in the future, I know thats speculative. My specific question regards how strongfeasiblestrong it would be for Microsoft to do this, assuming they wanted to. p

Negative 834 pIm developing a mobile app using Phonegap and it is primarily using the webView for content. One of the pages in the webView uses SwipeJS but when I load all of the dependent filescss amp js the images do not display. Ive been trouble shooting this issue for the last few hours and I think the best solution is to load all of the assets on the webview rather than in the app.p  pThe problem is when I add all of the assets to the page webview and then load the page thru the app none of the styles or script load.

Negative 834 pI am trying to select a sheet from the workbook that has the newest date. The date is in the same space for each sheet, otherwise it is blank or text, and therefore should never evaluate as greater than an integer or date formatted value i think.

Can i just use maxsheet.select for thatp

Negative 834 pI have a program that converts a string to integers.  The program works well as long as the user inputs valid numbers.  However, once I added some error checking to ensure that the values entered are actually numbers, I ran into some hitches.  Initially, I had the tryAgain tag as the first line of code in the getData procedure.  However, the error checking meant that following an invalid input when valid numbers are entered during the next iteration, the program kept returning the message invalid input.  Putting the tryAgain tag in the first line of code causes the program to keep returning the invalid input message even when valid input follows invalid input.  First, I attempted to put the tryAgain tag in its current position, but I think its running on an infinite loop.  Second, I attempted to reset variables if the program jumps to invalidInput, but that hasnt fixed it I tried this with tryAgain in its original position and current position.  p  pThis is MASM for x86 processors.

Negative 834 pMy professor has explicitly told us several times that in Xcode 4.6 callingp  precodesynthesize suit codepre  pis the same as callingp  precodesynthesize suit  suit codepre  pin that Xcode will create an ivar and name it with the underbar naming convention example codeproperty suitcode will get an ivar named codesuitcodep  pHowever, I have been looking at documentation and found this passage in the a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationcocoaconceptualProgrammingWithObjectiveCEncapsulatingDataEncapsulatingData.html relnofollowApple Documentation EncapsulatingDataap  blockquote   pImportant If you use synthesize without specifying an instance variable name, like this   synthesize firstName   the instance variable will bear the same name as the property.   In this example, the instance variable will also be called firstName, without an underscore.p blockquote  pThis appears to directly contradict my professor. p  pHere is what I know. In Xcode 4.6 any codepropertycode declared will get codesynthesizecodeed automatically so you wouldnt even need to call codesynthesizecode. If you allow Xcode to auto synthesize it does use the ivar underbar name codesuitcode.  However if you implment custom getters and setters you have to call codesynthesizecode explicitly.p  pMy question is this.  When you have a custom getter and setter as I have and need to call code synthesizecode does Xcode use the default underbar naming scheme when you dont specify the namep  pFor example when I call thisp  precodesynthesize suit codepre  pDoes Xcode name the underlying ivar codesuitcode or codesuitcodep  pFrom my simple tests and reading the docs it appears that codesynthesize suitcode becomes codesynthesize suit  suitcode and not codesynthesize suit  suitcode as my professor thinks it does.  I am a total rookie, just wrapping my head around properties and synthesizing so I need your help.  p  pAlso, what could I do to test this myself or find the actual answer in the docs Thanks. p
Negative 834 pIm new to RX but feel it should be able to provide a good solution to a task I wish to solve. After quite a bit of searching I still havent found a solution.p  pI have a WPF application within which a control does some work in response to some mouse move events. I would like to reduce the frequency of the events, so that the handler gets called less frequently than is currently the case as the user moves the mouse across the control. Ideally, what I want is to set up and subscribe to an observer. The observer should observe the mouse move events and call the client code with the most recent event and arguments after a particular time window has elapsed, say 0.2s. Being new to RX, I first replaced my original standard event hookup with an observer as followsp  precodevar mouseMove  Observable.FromEventPatternltMouseEventArgsgtmyControl, MouseMove  mouseMove.Subscribeargs gt myControlMouseMoveargs.Sender, args.EventArgs  codepre  pThis seemed to work fine.p  pI then attempted to modify the observer to get the behaviour I described above. I tried using the Throttle call and the Sample call. These didnt produce the outcome I expected or desire. In fact in certain cases using a particular overload of the ThrottleTimeSpan call killed my application dead, which still I dont understand.p  pThis is an example of what Ive triedp  precodevar mouseMove  Observable.FromEventPatternltMouseEventArgsgtmyControl, MouseMove.ThrottleTimeSpan.FromSeconds0.2  mouseMove.Subscribeargs gt myControlMouseMoveargs.Sender, args.EventArgs  codepre  pFrom reading, Throttle appears to swallow events until the frequency drops below a particular threshold not quite what I expected, whereas I believe Sample samples the observed events at a regular interval I would like the client code to be given the most recent event in a given time interval. If no events have been recorded in that interval, then the client should not be called.p  pHope someone can help an RX newbie on this.p  pOh, I also want to be kept informed of the reduced frequency mouse moves for the duration of the controls lifetime.p  pMaxp

Negative 834 pAccess 2010 here.p  pI have a nagging concern with two of my three subforms. The subforms are each bound to their own table with unique information the main form is also bound to its own table. All three subform tables are in a onetoone relationship with the main form table. My first subform acts normally in that when there is a new record, all of its bound entry fields are displayed blank. The code in FormCurrentp  precode  Private Sub FormCurrent    Determine what should be displayed   Do stuff to prepare the current record for display    If Me.NewRecord  True Then   Me.Stuff  Null   End If    End Sub codepre  pis present for all three subforms and the main form to display older records and to ready the form for data entry by resetting check boxes etc there is no code to reset the entry fields themselves. Unfortunately, the other two subforms retain data from the last entered record and display it as if the user wants to reenter the same data. The thing is, this data means nothing unless the user explicity enters the data entry field and then leaves it by any means. Simply moving on to the next record without entering the data entry fields doesnt save the phantom preentered data which is expected as the record in the subform was never made as the user never entered data in the subform.p  pWhat I am looking for is either a formspecific option to open a clean record by default, or VBA code that can ensure empty data fields on new record. I have tried actively requering the subforms when a new record is opened in the main form without success. I have also tried presetting vaules to  upon entering a new record, which did work to an extent, but seeing as one subform works properly, I am after a solution, not a workaround.p  pThank you for your input  p

Negative 834 pI need to find a memory corruption bug that affects Windows API. Basically, after running the program for some time, the codeCreateWindowExcode function returns a codeNULLcode handle and codeGetLastErrorcode returns 1407, which means Cannot find window class.

In fact, the program creates many windows of that class normally, then suddenly codeCreateWindowExcode refuses to create a new window and gives error 1407. There is only one thread on this program, and we are sure theres no call to codeUnregisterClasscode after the problem window class was registered.p  pWe suspect that our program is corrupting some codeUSER32code or other Windows data structure.

Negative 834 pHi all I might have a hard time explaining this, but I will try my best.p  pI am creating a DLL that will be injected into a program. In order to access the data I want from inside the DLL I mapped the data to a base address in which is a pointer to another address. From there I have to increment that address by 0x34 in order to access my data. I figured i could use structs to my advantage but it doesnt seem to be working. The problem is that I cant seem to figure out how to increment the second address to obtain the final pointer to my data.p  pWhat I have is thisp  precodetypedef unsigned char BYTE  typedef struct      DWORD SomeInt     big struct of DWORDS simulating what is in the applicaiton.     shortened for posting DATA  typedef struct      BYTE Unknown[0x34]     DATA pdata VARBASE   DWORD WINAPI function      VARBASE Stats  VARBASE0x00BBC9CC     char lol[1000]      sprintflol, stats pointer p    DATA pointer p, Stats, Statsgtpdata     SomeFunctionlol wrapper for MessageBoxA      return NULL  codepre  pStats points to the right address, but I cant manage to read 0x34 bytes of data or increment the pointer 0x34 in order to get the second pointer to my data set. When I use this current code pdata gets set to 0000155A or something similar, when it should be in the 0A0emem range, which causes a segfault when read. I know my math is correct because Ive opened the application up in a memory mapper like CheatEngine and I can specifically add the base pointer  address  0x34  my data from inside CheatEngine.p  pIs there a easier way to go about this rather then using a base structure to point to my data Basically its pointerpointer0x34data and the problem I am facing is that I cannot increment the second pointer and set it so I can access my data.p
Negative 834 pI am running a console application that takes data coming from various sensors around the house. Sometimes the transmission is interrupted and thus the packet does not make sense. When that happens, the contents of the packet is output to a terminal session.

Negative 834 pOkay so I am currently constructing a School schedule app as a beginner project and I could use some help with the final steps. My app essentially consists of two tableview controllers. THe first table contains the students block schedule My Schedule. My schedules table has a dictionary and has keys for each block the student could fill. The second contains a list of all the potential classes a student could take Class List. All the courses in class list are stored across several arrays. If the student wants to edit their schedule they press an edit button on My Schedule, this produces a Change button on every cell in the schedule. What I would like is to create an IBAction that would register the key of the cell that was pressed. Then the app would go over to class list and display all the classes. The user would select a new course and the app would take that course and use it to replace the course in the block that was changed. p  pI guess what I really need to know how to do isp  pregister which cell was chosenp  pprogrammatically segue between view controllersp  preplace a value in a dictionary for a particular keyp  pI realize that this is a lot of info and I apologize if it is confusing or I did not provide enough information. If you would like to see some of my code or need some clarification I would be more than happy to give it.p

Maybe someone can catch what may be causing to not work properly.p  precodeSub GetRandomDomains     dim conn, maxrecords, count, webname     dim randomrs, sql      If conn.State  adStateClosed Then     OpenDB conn     End If      count0     maxrecords100      KeywordColumnGetRandomKeywords conn, maxrecords, sql      If sql then         conn.close         set connnothing         Response.Write NOT AVAILABLE     exit sub     end if      set randomrsconn.executesql      Response.Writeltul idcatnavgt     do While Not randomrs.EOF and countltmaxrecords          If isnullrandomrssitename Then             webnamerandomrsdomain         Else             webnamerandomrssitename         End if         Response.Write ltligtlta hrefhttpwww.amp randomrsdomain ampgt ampnbsp amp webname ampltagtltligt         countcount1         randomrs.movenext     loop     Response.Writeltulgt      CloseSet randomrs     CloseDB conn end sub  Sub KeywordColumnGetRandomKeywords conn,maxrecords,sql     dim i, id, index, plist, rs, sqlstr, sortstr     plist     Set rsServer.CreateObjectADODB.Recordset     sqlstrSELECT domainid FROM domains     sqlstrsqlstr      Debugwrite sqlstr, sqlstr for random domains     rs.Open sqlstr,conn,3,3     If rs.eof then         CloseSet rs         Response.Write EMPTY         sql         exit sub     end if      Debugwrite rsdomainid, rs for random domains      Dim arrData  Array to Store Data     Dim arrSequence  Array to Hold Random Sequence     Dim iArrayLooper  Integer for Looping     Dim iarraysize  Size of Data Array      If xdbasetypeLocal Then         iarraysizecintrs.recordcount     else         iarraysizecintGetRecordcount conn     end if      Debugwrite GetRecordcountconn, getrecordcount for random domains array      DebugwriteIsArrayiarraysize, random domains count array     if cintGetRecordcountconn 0 or isnullcintGetRecordcountconn then     Exit Sub     End if     redim arrdatacintiarraysize     for i  0 to iarraysize1         arrDatairs0         rs.movenext     next     rs.close     Set rs  Nothing     If iarraysizeltmaxrecords then         maxrecordsiarraysize     end if      Get an array of numbers 0 to array size randomly sequenced.     arrSequence  ResequencearrayiArraySize     for i  0 to maxrecords1         indexarrsequencei         idarrdataindex         if plistltgt then             plistplist amp ,         end if         plistplist amp id     Next     sqlselect domainid, domain, sitename,sitematch,altmatch from domains     sql  sql amp  WHERE restricted0 andsitematch like  amp xsitematch amp  or altmatch like  amp xaltmatch amp      sql  sql amp  and domainid In  amp plist amp       Debugwrite sql, first sql for random domains end sub  Function ResequenceArrayiArraySize     Dim arrTemp     Dim I     Dim iLowerBound, iUpperBound     Dim iRndNumber     Dim iTemp      Set array size     ReDim arrTempiArraySize  1     Randomize     iLowerBound  LBoundarrTemp     iUpperBound  UBoundarrTemp     For I  iLowerBound To iUpperBound         arrTempI  I     Next      Loop through the array once, swapping each value      with another in a random location within the array.

Negative 834 pIm now following a series of video tutorials on YouTube, to be specific a Game Programming tutorial by TheChernoProject. I got to episode 36, which is about rendering a level from tiles. I wont get into too much detail on that, but I encountered a strange problem that no one has encountered at least no one asked for help with it.br To be more precise I have a Sprite class, a Tile class with two classes extending it GrassTile and VoidTile and a Level class. Level cosists of Tiles, which are made of sprite. You can see the tile here  p  precodepublic static Tile grass  new GrassTileSprite.grass public static Tile voidTile  new VoidTileSprite.voidSprite codepre  pAnd the sprite is created like thatp  precodepublic static Sprite grass  new Sprite16, 0, 0, Spritesheet.tileset public static Sprite voidSprite  new Sprite16, 0x00AAFF codepre  pTwo constructors for sprites these arep  precodeint size, int x, int y, Spritesheet sheet int size, int colour codepre  pAnd the level is randomly generated with fields ranging from 03 0 is grass, the rest is currently just VoidTile. But something is wrong with the way it displays graphics. I did check it with the use of printlns, and Im sure most of it works it does assign correct Tiles, depending on ID. You can see it therep  precodeID 0    Tile com.ekhart.game.level.tile.GrassTile73d74138    Sprite com.ekhart.game.gfx.Sprite3d0c51ef ID 2    Tile com.ekhart.game.level.tile.VoidTile3ba0d916    Sprite com.ekhart.game.gfx.Sprite3d0c51ef ID 3    Tile com.ekhart.game.level.tile.VoidTile3ba0d916    Sprite com.ekhart.game.gfx.Sprite3d0c51ef ID 1    Tile com.ekhart.game.level.tile.VoidTile3ba0d916    Sprite com.ekhart.game.gfx.Sprite3d0c51ef codepre  pAnd you might notice, that the Sprite is the same, even though when I create the grass and voidTile classes, they have different sprites assigned to them. And the weird part is that the sprite assigned depends on the order in which I create them. Now all tiles have a voidSprite graphic, because I created VoidTile last. When I swap them around making GrassTile last, they all have grass sprite. I tried everything I could think of to make this work, but it doesnt. I have uploaded the project folder, so you can import it and check the code, maybe Ive missed something.p  pProject url a hrefhttpsdl.dropboxusercontent.comu18909657TheGame.rar relnofollowhttpsdl.dropboxusercontent.comu18909657TheGame.rarap

Negative 834 pI have a relatively simple model design for creating surveys, assigning surveys to users and filling out surveys by those users. It all works fine, but when it comes to retrieving data from those surveys I am in a state where I am not sure what is the right approach, especially what is the rails way. p  pMy model design is as follows for clarity left only the relevant codep  precodeclass Survey lt ActiveRecordBase   hasmany surveysections, dependent destroy    hasmany surveyassignments   hasmany participants , through gt surveyassignments, source gt user    hasmany surveyresponses end  class SurveySection lt ActiveRecordBase   belongsto survey   hasmany surveyquestions, dependent destroy   hasmany surveyoptions, dependent destroy end codepre  pSo surveys are divided into many sections and each section has many questions, also each section has many options, options are basically a predefined answers for all the questions in the current section. This is design decision, so I dont need each question to have many options...p  precodeclass SurveyQuestion lt ActiveRecordBase   belongsto surveysection   hasmany surveyanswers end  class SurveyAnswer lt ActiveRecordBase   belongsto surveyoption   belongsto surveyquestion   belongsto surveyresponse end  class SurveyOption lt ActiveRecordBase   it has 2 fields weightint and textstring   belongsto surveysection end codepre  pDoctors can assign surveys to their patients and specify the date until when can they take the survey. p  precodeclass SurveyAssignment lt ActiveRecordBase   has also a field validuntildate     belongsto user   belongsto survey    hasmany surveyresponses end codepre  pI am also logging a survey response. So everytime a user filled out the form a new record in surveyresponses table is created. I will need this later, because of the scheduling implementation, where user could possibly have surveys assigned that he should be taking [enter some number here] X [dayweekmonth].p  precodeclass SurveyResponse lt ActiveRecordBase   belongsto surveyassignment   belongsto survey   belongsto user    hasmany surveyanswers  end codepre  pNow I need to display a graph of survey results. Like you see in the code, results are integers see SurveyOption class that I need to add up for particular survey that particular user took. So lets say I have a userid and a surveyid, now I want to retrieve all of that users survey responses, but for each survey response I need the sum of weightsSurveyOption that their answers have. p  pIf I do a following query, I get back the sum of his answers for all his responsesp  precodeSurveyResponse.joinssurveyanswers gt surveyoption.whereuserid 96, surveyid63.selectsurveyoption.weight.sumweight codepre  pBut I would like to get back for every response of that user for that survey an array, something like thisp  precode[[surveyresponse.createdat.toi, thesumofweights],[...],[...],....] codepre  pSo what is the best way of doing something like this Is it possible to do it in a single query, if I think purely in sql statemets I think this could be done in a single query.p  pIf someone needs me to elaborate further, we can discuss in the comments. Thanks for helping me out. p  pI guess the sql tatement Im looking to produce is p  precodeSELECT surveyresponses.id, surveyresponses.createdat, SUM surveyoptions.weight FROM surveyresponses INNER JOIN surveyanswers ON surveyanswers.surveyresponseid  surveyresponses.id INNER JOIN surveyoptions ON surveyoptions.id  surveyanswers.surveyoptionid WHERE surveyresponses.userid  96 AND surveyresponses.surveyid  64  GROUP BY surveyresponses.id, surveyresponses.createdat codepre  pI think Im getting close to solving my own question p

Negative 834 pFirst things first, I want to adjust the pattern that Angular uses to match against for URL routing. I have found the function and it is running the URL location against these regexs found on line 5612 of angular.js version a hrefhttpcode.angularjs.org1.1.5 relnofollowhttpcode.angularjs.org1.1.5ap  precodeSERVERMATCH  []w0,1w[w.][09][][]., PATHMATCH  [][]., DEFAULTPORTS  http 80, https 443, ftp 21 codepre  pSo why would I want to do that I am using angular as the framework for a desktop AIR application. AIR applications can be built using HTMLJS, which is subsequently wrapped in AIR which provides access to the filesystem and OS. So this combination essentially allows you to build a multiplatform desktop web application with angular. Powerful stuff.p  pHere is the problem AIR has a custom address bar string which looks like codeappcode rather than codehttpcode. So it has one slash instead of two. Angular uses the the address bar location to route the application, i.e. codehttpsomething.comcontactListcode means load the codecontactListcode view and its associated controller.  My knowledge of regex is pretty very limited so I cant read the patterns I included above, but I am guessing that the one slash instead of two or something similar to that could be the problem.p  pMy aim is to adjust the patterns so that codeappcode would be a valid pattern and my hope is that the URI segment making and associated actions would still work. p

Negative 834 pAll,p  pMy requirement is fairly simple. I have to perform a simple HTTP POST to an IPport combination. I used simple socket programming to do that and I have been successful in sending across my request to them and also get back response from them. The only problem being that the response is always a HTTP 400 Bad Request followed by my HTTP POST message. I am not sure if the problem is with the client or the server. My only guess being that there might be a problem with my data that I am sending. This is what my POST looks likep  precodePOST ltServer Taggt HTTP5.1 ContentLength xxx   Content codepre  pand the response from the server looks something like thisp  precodeHTTP1.1 400 Bad Request ContentLength xxx  Same content that I sent them codepre  pI was not sure If I could put in the IP of the server here so kept myself to using . I am pretty sure that the problem would not be there since I get back some response from the server and confident about the connection. Can someone help me p  pPS Some pointers about my POSTbrp  p1 HTTP 5.1 was requested by the server and I am not sure if that is correctbr 2 I have played around with the number of line spaces after the content length. I have tried giving one and two lines. Not sure if that would make a difference. On wireshark though I see a difference with the number of line spaces as with a single line space the protocol is specified as TCP but with two it changes to HTTP. The response is always received on HTTP protocol. Some explanation on the difference would also helpp  pThanksp  pedit the other thing that confuses me is that the response has a HTTP 1.1 and not a 5.1 that I had sent. I have also tried changing my post to 1.1 with no successp  pedit2 Based on suggestion form fvu and others, I used WebClient to Upload my request. Still got back a 400. The header that was generated by the WebClient looks like thisp  precodePOST ltserver taggt HTTP1.1 Host ltIPPORTgt ContentLength 484 Expect 100continue Connection KeepAlive codepre  pThe issue I see with this might be that the server was not expecting all the details in the header.

Negative 834 pIm building a messaging app like WhatsApp. My goal is to expose only REST API through Rails and push notifications to connected clients via websockets. So clients communicate with server only with the REST API. Only the server sends data through the websocket. Clients can only receive data from it.p  pCurrently Ive built an eventmachine server listening for websocket connections and Unix domain socket connections. When a client performs a request on the REST API, Rails connects to the Unix domain socket to tell the eventmachine what connected client needs to be notified through the websocket.p  pMy concern is about how it will behave in production my server runs Apache Passenger. So Im looking for some project to solve my problem. I had a look at Faye but I cant understand how to force it to send notifications to connected clients from an external process that might be rails while is performing a request. Any ideasp

Negative 834 pIn my case, I have data from multiple tables that I want to extract a single query. Its about football statistics. In one minute table recorded the dates of the matches and the other recorded data and results of the matches. The problem is that I want to limit the applications of dates, not the number of matches, as in a day has a few games. Managed to build a complex query that displays all my data, but it displays the results on the number of games rather than the dates so I can not use limitation, because eating in this case becomes more games rather than dates.

Is this possiblep  pI have read several answers regarding communicating with an AIR app via Android, but I havent found any for communicating with an Activity via an AIR app. p  pThanks so muchp

Negative 834 pMe and a buddy of mine have been working on a website project using Sublime Text 2 as an editor. Were hosting everything locally, and we love Sublime but sometimes things get tangled when were both trying to edit the same file, or when we both have the file open but dont realize were not the only one in it.p  pSo Ive tried to come up with something that saves the file when you edit it, and then reloads all open tabs so that you can see the changes your colleagues have made to it. Ideally it wont interrupt workflow, but it will highlight tabs that have been edited.p  pThe files are all hosted locally, so were literally changing the same files not duplicates on different machines.p  pI dont know python and Im not that familiar with object oriented code, so naturally Ive run into a bit of trouble when trying to find a way to accomplish this. I pieced together a plugin from various things I found online a hrefhttpwww.sublimetext.comdocs2apireference.html relnofollowhttpwww.sublimetext.comdocs2apireference.htmla with the following codep  precodeimport sublime import sublimeplugin import os  class AutoSaveCommandsublimeplugin.EventListener def onmodifiedself, view     if view.filename  None         view.runcommandsave codepre  pThis succeeded, and it saves the file whenever it is modified. We have very fast machines and the files were editing arent usually that large LESSSASS files, but now the next step is to push this change to the open files so that if one of us edits it the other will see the change or it will highlight the tab if were not focused on it, like it does when we edit and then move view without saving.p  pI can think of two ways to do this, one would be to run a command on an interval to check for file changes and reload the contents of the files. The other would be to somehow detect when a file is changed and reload files then.p  pI tried this for the first option, but it just crashes Sublime, Im guessing I just suck that much at Python lol.p  precodeimport sublime import sublimeplugin import sched import time  s  sched.schedulertime.time, time.sleep def checkforchangessc      sublime.view.runcommandlivereload     sc.enter60, 1, checkforchanges, sc,  s.enter60, 1, checkforchanges, s, s.run  class LivereloadCommandsublimeplugin.WindowCommand     def runself         window  self.window         current  window.activeview         groups  window.numgroups     for i in range0, groups         window.focusgroupi         viewsnum  window.viewsingroupi         for innerview in viewsnum             window.focusviewinnerview      window.focusviewcurrent codepre  pAny ideas on how to fix this code, or how to detect file changes and reload the file that way, or any other method to achieve this goal, would be greatly appreciated.p  pIm certain that if somebody who actually knows Python tackled this and built a plugin to achieve this kind of functionality it would be liked by the ST2 community.p  pThanksp

Negative 834 pI have a model, call it codeAcode, which has an FK relation to another model, call it codeBcode. codeBcode has a codeDateFieldcode well call codedatecode. I need to filter codeAcode based on the codedatecode field in the FK.  Im getting the date that Im filtering based on as a string in the form codeYYYYMMDDcode in a variable called codestartcode. The filtering is a greater than filter. Im filtering a queryset called coderesultscode, which has itself been filtered based on some other criteria. p  pHeres the code I have right now.p  precodestartdatetime.strptimestart, Ymd results.filterBdategtestart codepre  pThen something is done with coderesultscode, however, nothing is being filtered.

Negative 834 pI have a chart control that I would like to display, on a bar chart, the contents of a stored procedure. The sproc has several columns, but I only care about 2 for this particular chart. The first column contains X Axis members, and the second column contains the Y Axis values for those x axis members. My code is as followsp  precode        SqlCommand myCommand  new SqlCommand         myCommand.Connection  new SqlConnectionmyString         myCommand.CommandText  spHeyStackoverflow         myCommand.CommandType  CommandType.StoredProcedure          SqlParameter parameter  new SqlParameter         parameter.ParameterName  ParameterName         parameter.SqlDbType  SqlDbType.VarChar         parameter.Direction  ParameterDirection.Input         parameter.Value  Q          myCommand.Parameters.Addparameter          chart1.DataSource  myCommand          chart1.Series[Series1].XValueMember  ProductType         chart1.Series[Series1].YValueMembers  Count          chart1.DataBind codepre  pI literally did nothing to the chart on the designer side besides placing it. Once I dragged it to the screen, I hopped to code to mess with it. So whats here is all Ive done to it in case I missed something, I dont want anyone to assume I didnt just because it isnt here.p  pThe issue Ive run into is that the ProductType columns returns 18 rows, and yet only 3 are showing up on the X Axis Not only that, but they are spread out evenly spaced as if those 3 are all the chart intended to show.p  pThe Y axis is just fine in fact, there are 18 total bars and each seems to be showing the proper value So I have 18 bars, with only 3 x axis tick marks p  pCan anyone see what I did wrong here, or what I could do to fix this If absolutely necessary I CAN statically set the x axis members, but this sproc may change in the future and Id like to keep it as open ended as possible.p  pThanksp

Negative 834 pHonestly, FB is driving me a little crazy  but thats just a sidenote...p  pI kinda gave up finding a way of authenticating a user without leaving my app and opening Safari or the facebook app which just breaks the whole user experience for NO apparent reason.p  pAnyway, since they insist, I dont have a choice. BUT All of FBs examples handle the FBSession in the AppDelegate. IMHO, thats not where it belongs to. My App doesnt revolve entirely around FB, its just a part of it for uploading some things to a users timeline IF she really wants that. So Id like to handle the whole FBSessionstuff in my viewController that handles the FBupload.p  pBut when a user authenticates, FB wants me to implement the following in my AppDelegatep  precode BOOLapplicationUIApplication application             openURLNSURL url   sourceApplicationNSString sourceApplication          annotationidannotation       attempt to extract a token from the url     return [FBAppCall handleOpenURLurl                   sourceApplicationsourceApplication                         withSessionself.session]  codepre  pBut at this stage, I dont have codeself.sessioncode in my AppDelegate. How do I pass this on to my ViewController Can I store it somewhere I found a class a hrefhttpbarrycenter.comBAMcoding201107simplifyingfacebookiossdk relnofollowhttpbarrycenter.comBAMcoding201107simplifyingfacebookiossdka which creates a Singleton. But its for an outdated version of the SDK and I cant figure out how to change it so it works with the new SDK. Creating a Singleton seems like a good idea to me  so could anybody point me into the right direction how Id do this with the latest SDK 3.8p

Negative 834 pI am trying to alter the visible buttons on the toolbar depending on the state of the table view. Is this possiblep  pTo add more detail I currently have a list of exercises in a table view. There is a toolbar at the bottom with a button on it new allowing the user to create a new exercise. When the user clicks edit in the top right the view goes into editing mode and I want them to be able to delete exercises using multiple selection by clicking a now unhidden delete button in the toolbar. At this point I am trying to make the new button disappear and leave only the delete button. p  pI can find lots of answers of how to add toolbars and add buttons to them but none seem to be dealing with this once the view has loaded.p  pI have thought about having two different toolbars with the separate buttons on each and then switching which is hidden and which is visible but this will lead to other problems so I am exploring whether there is an easy way to only hide the added buttons.p

Negative 834 pI want to have Java create a database and a user for me. I am using Netbeans so that I can see what databases exist. When I create the database I can see in Netbeans  Services  Databases that the database exists.p  pThe program initially checks if the database already exists, so that I can run it multiple times. What surprised me was when I ran it a second time it didnt know that the database already existed so that it wanted to recreate the database. If Netbeans sees it, why doesnt my Java program see it I found my error in the grant statement, so Ill fix it to be correct.p  pI have routines to drop databases and users. Here too if I drop a database, it disappears inside the Netbeans  Services  Databases.p  pThe situation with users is working with no problems. If I drop a user and then create the database, it will recognize that the user doesnt exist, and create him. If I drop just the database, it recognizes that the user already exists.p  pI will include some code snippets for the drop database and userp  precode    String sql  drop user   user       try          stm1  con1.createStatement         executeStatementstm1, sql         stm1.close         con1.close      catch Exception e  System.out.printlne.getMessage      String sql  drop database   dbName     try          stm1  con1.createStatement         executeStatementstm1, sql         stm1.close         con1.close      catch Exception e  System.out.printlne.getMessage codepre  pAs can be seen there is nothing special going on here. In the create database, I thought the problem could stem from the fact that I wasnt creating any tables at this stage. Edited to remove the adding of a table.p  pOK, at this stage the database has no tables. I need to go in a second time and now I expect to be able to connect to the database I just created with the user who has privileges on the database.

The attempted key was   notifieeid.Summary When adding a document to a relation, Mongoid   attempts to link the newly added document to the base of the relation   in memory, as well as set the foreign key to link them on the database   side. In this case Mongoid could not determine what the inverse   foreign key was.Resolution If an inverse is not required, like a   belongsto or hasandbelongstomany, ensure that inverseof  nil   is set on the relation. If the inverse is needed, most likely the   inverse cannot be figured out from the names of the relations and you   will need to explicitly tell Mongoid on the relation what the inverse   is.p blockquote  pWhat could I be doing wrong Or, is there a better way to model thisp  pAny help is much appreciated Thank you.p

Negative 834 pI have spent time looking for information on the best algorithm to create a nesting of irregular polygons in 2D using manual and automatic positioning. I need to use such an algorithm in the context of CADCAM software. Here are the real possibilities Ive found so farp  ul lipstrongSeparating Axis Theoremstrong is a fairly quick and simple algorithm to implement, but the drawback I find with it is that it only works with convex polygons. To work with concave polygons, a convex decomposition would need to be done first. This implies an increase in the runtime and the implementation of a new algorithm that decomposes the concave polygon into convex polygons.pli lipstrongNesting by a power functionstrong calculating the partial derivatives in the X and Y axes, you could get the escape direction you should take a polygon so that there is a collision between the two polygons. This function of energy and I tested and the three major problems that I have encountered are first obtaining local minima , second nesting when the collision occurs over a piece and finally the execution time is very high.pli lipUsing strongnofit polygonstrong use the nofit polygon to the nesting can be somewhat interesting. I have read several papers on the subject although there are very few online documentation on it. Not sure if it can really be a useful choice. I still have several doubts on the details of this approach.pli ul  pAny idea which of these algorithms to choose Or if you know any other options that can be used Im a little confused  .p  pThank you very much.p

Negative 834 pI am writing an application that uses a remote API that serves up a fairly static data but still can update several times a day.

Negative 834 pIm shipping a SQL Server CE database with a Windows Phone app and I was wondering if anyone had any insight on how to store some data. Ive got a ton of data stored as arrays which are attributed to other incode objects. The arrays consist of value identifiers integers which correspond to an attribute for the object. For examplep  pstrongObject Astrongp  ul liAttributeSet1 [1, 3, 6, 9]li liAttributeSet2 [2, 4, 6, 8]li liAttributeDictionary 1  Attribute 1,                       2  Attribute 2,                       3  Attribute 3,                       .....li ul  pIve got hundreds of objects which have tens of attributes each. I was thinking of storing this data in one of two ways either having multiple tables per AttributeSet where each column corresponds to an Attribute in the AttributeDictionary and each row corresponds to an Object OR  Somehow store each AttributeSet as an array in a database where the columns are per Attribute set and each row is an Object. Option 1 requires creating multiple tables with multiple columns and option 2 requires one tables with a few columns but with serialized data in each. There is an XmlSerializer class for Windows Phone 8 that I can use to serialize and deserialize the data. p  pWhich way of storing the data would be the most efficient and easiest to implement I dont really need to be able to search through the AttributeSets so Im thinking serializing the data then storing it in the database may be the easiest.p  pstrongTLDR Should I store arrays associated to objects as serialized data in a database or separate the array into columns and create multiple tablesstrongp  pAny thoughtstipsp

Negative 834 pActually I have two question.brp  pI have a method named codeFillPersonListcode which is always loaded when form start. Inside that method I access the database and put required value inside a dictionary. Previously, I cant reload the related listbox when new value is added.

When user type a word, listbox should sort itself according to that word. I do not wish to access if every time user type a word. So I declared previous dictionary outside of that method and access that method inside textBox changed method. OK, now it also work but after typing if i clear that textbox listbox only show the last value. And second problem is now if I click on refresh button It shows an codeArgumentExceptioncode error.brp  pstrongSample codestrongbrp  precodeDictionaryltint, stringgt personListDictionary  new Dictionaryltint, stringgt private void FillPersonList    connect to database   SqlCommand prsonListCmd  new SqlCommandSQLQUERY, conn   SqlDataReader dr  prsonListCmd.ExecuteReader     if dr.HasRows               while dr.Read                    Access value           personListDictionary.Addkey, value Here ArgumentException occurs                       PersonList.DisplayMember  Value       PersonList.ValueMember  Key       PersonList.DataSource  new BindingSourcepersonListDictionary, null   private void sortListBoxTextChangedobject sender, EventArgs e    Access personListDictionary value  codepre  pI need only one solution.

Negative 834 pI have a hardware that I use to generate RSA keys and signatures. I need two thingsp  p1 Generate a certificate request. With the hardware I can get the public key for the certificate and do the signing part. I need the code to do the certificate generation, i.e., do the ASN.1DERPEM stuff.p  p2 Sign data using SMIME. Again, I will use the hardware to do the signing part, but I need the code to do the format part PKCS7 to envelop both a signature and a x509 certificate resulting from the previous task.p  pSo I could use openssl both to generate the CSR and the SMIME formats, but openssl requires for such tasks a private key to sign, and as I said the signing I do it via hardware. I know there is a mechanism called engines to plug hardware functions to openssl, but it uses dynamic libraries, which are not supported on my platform early uClinux for ARM.p  pSo the question is is there any other way I could force openssl to take an extern public key, and more importantly, to delegate the signing to my hardware Otherwise, would you recommend another CC library I could use to do this I really dont need a cryptographic library, it would suffice with a library that knows how to generate those formats certificate requests and SMIME.p

Negative 834 pBasically Ive got an isometric map and my player fixed and centered in the middle of the screen always. To check for collisions, I first convert the point to map coords, then use those coords to check if the tile itself, depending on which way the player is moving, has properties that contain the word blocked. If yes then stop movement return to oldposY and oldposX Well, it works, sort of. My player stops on tiles that dont contain blocked Every time the player stops in this video the code is detecting that he hit a tile with the properties marked blocked, however this is wrong.p  pHere is a video showing the problem in action a hrefhttpyoutu.beFG12KGweg4 relnofollowhttpyoutu.beFG12KGweg4ap  pI am printing my x,y coords in the top left of the screen and it shows my x and y increasing or decreasing even if Im traveling in just one direction. So for example, If Im walking only to the Right on my screen, the x AND y both increase when youd think only the X should be increasing. This is true for any direction traveled, up, upright, left, upleft, etc.. I dont know if that helps but I think that means the MapUtils.toIsometricGridPoint function is not working properly.   Would it simplify this at all knowing that my character player is fixed always at the center of the screenp  pOn with the code.

Negative 834 pI have a web application in which I use jQuery to get data from a controller to refresh a page. The request passes along a json object containing nested arrays.

Negative 834 pI was trying to position an image that was only 8px high as the first element on a page. I set the positions as top0, and left0, but the image kept appearing appearing underneath the image below it in everything except IE. When I changed the position to top8px, the image appeared in the right place in Chrome, one pixel off in Firefox and Safari, and completely wrong in IE. Changing the height of the div seemed to have no impact, nor did changes in the float properties, margins, etc. Eventually, I eliminated the top image and incorporated it into the larger image below it with some modifications to everything, of course, then I made that new image the first element on the page with the same zero,zero coordinates and everything positioned correctly after that. This worked fine, but Id still like to have an answer as to where the problem lies. It seems as if once an element falls below a certain size, all bets are off. Does this have something to do with font heights even though there were no fonts involved Since Ive solved the problem, I have, at least, one answer, but Id be interested if there is better, more official explanation for what was happening, especially regarding the one pixel shift between Chrome and FF.p

Negative 834 pI use exceptions extensively, and I often face the dilemma of where to put logic for a very specific exception.p  pTo illustrate lets say that I have implemented my own XML parser which takes a file path, opens the file and parses it. Now in case of parse error I want to throw an exception, which specifies where the incorrect XML is in the file. This is done by outputting message which containsp  ol lifile nameli liline numberli linearest string contentsli ol  pThus far Ive been trying to do this by feeding the exception only with scalars, as they may be immediately used in the message. This has become my rule emas little logic as possible inside exceptionsem. And following that rule any computations of the variables used in exception were located outside that exception. p  pA simplified examplep  precodevoid parseXmlFilestring filePath             int line  currentLine     string surroundingText  StringHelper.getSurroundingTextfilePath, offset      throw new SpecificXmlParseErrorfilePath, line, surroundingText  codepre  pBut as my project evolved Ive had the need to reuse my exception many times. Each time I was forced to compute the same variables over again, which violated the DRY rule. So I wonder if it would be ok to put the computation logic inside the exception and feed it only with the parameters required for computing the data for the message. It could look like thisp  precodeclass SpecificXmlParseError      void SpecificXmlParseErrorfilePath, offset  baseComputeMessagefilePath, offset           static string ComputeMessagefilePath, offset              int line  computeLineBasedOnOffsetfilePath, offset         string surroundingText  StringHelper.getSurroundingTextfilePath, offset         string exceptionMessage  putTogetherMessagesurroundingText         return exceptionMessage           ...  codepre  pThe risk here is that the computation logic can throw another exception. But is there a specific reason why this is bad Only bad thing I can think of is that it would hide the original exception and the real reason from any logger that will catch them. But on the other hand the same thing would happen in the first case, where the data is computed before the exception. So are there some additional concerns of which Im forgettingp  pA middle solution would be to write helper class, which would compute the string message. This is the most elegant solution I came up with so far, but it also feels like way to much in this case and violates KISS after all I just want to throw an exception.p  pIs there a winwin solution for this What are the pros and cons of the solutionsp

Negative 834 pAnswering a question about how to remove the float part of a number remove .25 from 100.25, one user answered that codeintfloatnumcode was a good way to remove its float part. I came across a way using strings that I thought was obviously worse than that, but I thought it was interesting to consider it. This was my answer codestrfloatnum.split.[0]code. Longer and uglier, this approach seems worse than just converting to int.p  pThen, could anyone explain me why the benchmarks I tried, gave better results to the longer method than to the simpler Maybe having a core i7 computer affects the results Am I doing something wrongp  pEDIT The final answers type doesnt need to be an int. The point is just analyze why removing the float part is faster with the str method in my casep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comqcXFI.png altbenchmarksp

Negative 834 pI have been working with the a hrefhttpplugins.jquery.comfancytree relnofollowFancytree jQuery plugina written by Martin Wendt and it is fantastic. However, Ive been struggling with one particular aspect. Im using HTML rather than JSON for the data structure of the tree and discovered that it renders with missing nodes.p  pI spent a fair bit of time narrowing this down to the fact that the Fancytree control must be expecting a single codeltULgtcode structure. Anything else in the structure must be nested under codeltLIgtcode. However I do not understand why. Let me explain.p  pHere is some sample HTMLp  precodeltdiv idtreegt    ltUL idbrowser classfiletreegt       ltLI classfoldergt          Folder 1          ltULgt             ltLIgtNested Folder 1                ltULgt                   ltLIgtSubitem1ltLIgt                   ltLIgtSubitem2ltLIgt                ltULgt             ltLIgt          ltULgt          ltULgt             ltLIgtNested Folder 2                ltULgt                   ltLIgtSubitem1ltLIgt                   ltLIgtSubitem2ltLIgt                ltULgt             ltLIgt         ltULgt       ltLIgt    ltULgt ltdivgt codepre  pWhen this HTML is rendered in IE, Chrome or pretty much any browser it correctly appears as two sequential unordered lists with nested items. However, when I apply Fancytree the node Nested Folder 2 completely vanishes. In fact, there are no JavaScript errors or warnings from the plugin framework.p  pTherefore, my question is somewhat two foldp  ol lipBased upon W3C standards is the above properly formatted HTML syntax I think yes.pli lipWhy does the Fancytree not render the second folder Is it a bug with Fancytree Is there a customization I can easily do to get this to renderpli ol  pMy source for this HTML is dynamic and involves a rather complex XSLT so Im hoping the answer is not to have to refactor the HTML structure.p  pI would greatly appreciate any insight that could be offered.p

Negative 834 pI know my title is probably not the best description of what I am attempting to do, but lets see if I cant explain my situation a little better here.p  pBasically, what I am trying to achieve is attaching a Simulink model which, when run generates a set of data which I want to display in a graphical interface. I did not make the Simulink model myself, nor have I worked with Simulink before, so I am wondering what the best way to do this would be. The data can change in real time, and I want the display to update with it in correspondence with the output data. This will eventually be used for a game which the user is supposed to control, so the live feedback should be accurate and with minimal delay.p  pIdeally, if I were making a game I would code the entire thing in either C or Java, but the input device we are using to collect the data is dependent on the simulink module for processing the data from it.p  pI have looked at this from another similar question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8198488accesscallsimulinkfrompythonAccessCall Simulink from Pythonap  pa hrefhttpsimulinksimserv.sourceforge.net relnofollowhttpsimulinksimserv.sourceforge.netap  pIt is a server for transmitting the data via XML file, but I am wondering if there is a simpler way to get the data from Simulink into a graphics application written in JavaCCPython that doesnt have the overhead of a server like SimServer.p  pAny and all suggestions are appreciated.p

Will the codeecho Donencode still be executed I have attempted something similar, albeit in a class structure, and it was only embeforeem my codesighandlercode ever got called.p  pMy class codeconstructcode calls the function coderegisterSignalscodep  precodeprivate function registerSignals     iffunctionexistspcntlsignal         calluserfunc[this, sigintCleanup]         pcntlsignalSIGINT, [this, sigintCleanup]         pcntlsignalSIGTERM, [this, sigtermCleanup]         pcntlsignalSIGHUP, [this, sighupCleanup]         pcntlsignalSIGUSR1, [this, sigusr1Cleanup]        protected function sigintCleanup     echo In SIGINT cleanupn     thisgtcleanup   protected function sigtermCleanup     echo In SIGTERM cleanupn     thisgtcleanup   protected function sighupCleanup     echo In SIGHUP cleanupn     thisgtcleanup   protected function sigusr1Cleanup     echo In SIGUSR1 cleanupn     thisgtcleanup   protected function cleanup     echo Shutting downn     exit1  codepre  pAnd then within my testing of this process, I do some simple codesleepcodes and codeechocodes codestartcode is just a function called after the construction and signal registration is finishedp  precodefunction start     echo  Testing the test script n     sleep10000     echo given how ticks work, this might not be called...n     echo nAfter sleep... this should not be executed if there was a signal interrupt.n  codepre  pSo I use codectlccode during the codesleepcode. My resultp  precode Testing the test script  Cgiven how ticks work, this might not be called...  After sleep... this should not be executed if there was a signal interrupt. In SIGINT cleanup Shutting down codepre  pAs you can see from my codeechocodes, I kinda figured maybe the way a hrefhttpwww.phpdig.netrefrn62.html relnofollowticksa work was responsible for finishing the codestartcode function embeforeem handling the signal. I still think this might be the case. The truth is, I just dont know.p  pI do declare codetickscode at the top of my programp  precodedeclareticks  1 codepre  pNot handling signals immediately is causing problems for me. What if, for instance, I had this bit of code in my codestartcode function and Ive tested thisp  precodecount  0 whiletrue     count     echo countn     sleep5  codepre  pEven if my codecleanupcode function has an codeexitcode, I never reach that because the codeSIGINTcode just knocks me out of codesleepcode, and I continue in the loop and begin codesleepcodeing again.p  pSo heres my question How does codesignalcode handling work in codePHPcode How can I guarantee that when I get a signal, it is handled immediately I dont just want some piece of code that will fix this, I would like an emexplanationem or at least a link to a good one and a summary.p  pPHP version 5.4.22p  pOS Ubuntu 12.10p

Negative 834 pIve just starting to playing with Android and Delphi.

The given path does not exist. Ive tried to locate this file with Windows Explorer, ES File Explorer and had no success. I do not have an SD card inserted.

Negative 834 pWere trying to make a DTS package where itll launch a stored procedure and capture the contents in a flat file. This will have to run every night, and the new file should overwrite the existing file.p  pThis wouldnt normally be a problem, as we just plug in the query and it runs, but this time everything was complicated enough that we chose to approach it with a stored procedure employing temporary tables. How can I go about using this in a DTS package I tried going the normal route with the Wizard and then plugging in EXEC BlahBlah.dbo... It did not care for thatp  pThe Statement could not be parsed. Additional information Invalid object name DestinyDistHS. Microsoft SQL Server Native Client 10.0p  pCan anyone guide me in the right direction herep  pThanks.p
Negative 834 pI have a class which represents a set of numbers. The constructor takes three arguments codestartValuecode, codeendValuecode and codestepSizecode. The class is responsible for holding a list containing all values between start and end value taking the stepSize into consideration.p  pExample startValue 3, endValue 1, stepSize  1, Collection   3,2,1 p  pI am currently creating the collection and some info strings about the object in the constructor. The public members are read only info strings and the collection.p  pMy constructor does three things at the momentp  ul lipChecks the arguments this could throw an exception from the constructorpli lipFills values into the collectionpli lipGenerates the information stringspli ul  pI can see that my constructor does real work but how can I fix this, or, should I fix this If I move the methods out of the constructor it is like having init function and leaving me with an not fully initialized object. Is the existence of my object doubtful Or is it not that bad to have some work done in the constructor because it is still possible to test the constructor because no object references are created.p  pFor me it looks wrong but it seems that I just cant find a solution. I also have taken a builder into account but I am not sure if thats right because you cant choose between different types of creations. However single unit tests would have less responsibility.p  pI am writing my code in C but I would prefer a general solution, thats why the text contains no code.p  pEDIT Thanks for editing my poor text  I changed the title back because it represents my opinion and the edited title did not. I am not asking if real work is a flaw or not. For me, it is. Take a look at this reference. p  pa hrefhttpmisko.hevery.comcodereviewersguideflawconstructordoesrealwork relnofollowhttpmisko.hevery.comcodereviewersguideflawconstructordoesrealworkap  pThe blog states the problems quite well.

Very similar to how in any C project you would have an output directory. p  pMy first reaction to this question would be to not work in this fashion, unfortunately I do not have any control over this situation, only need to develop a solution to the problem.p  pThanksp

Negative 834 pI am using Laravel 4, and the Eloquent ORM. In my system, when someone deletes a record, it has to check if it has any associated records. If it doesnt, then it may be deleted permanently. But if it does, just perform a softDeletion.p  pThe way that this situation is being handled is try to forceDelete, and if it throws an Exception because of the referential integrity, catch it and softDelete. I know this looks gimmicky, but it was made by another developer and Id rather not mess with his code.p  pWhat he did was to delete, then if it threw an Exception, just set a flag to inactivate the record. It did work well. However, when I took over I implemented softDeleting to make things less gimmicky.p  pNow, when it tries to forceDelete,it throws the QueryException but doesnt fall into the catch block.

Negative 834 pIm trying to put a marquee at the bottom of my app of status updates of different users of the app. It must constantly be moving to the left displaying each status one after the other. Users can continuously change update their status which gets stored in a database on a server so basically the marquee needs to be constantly checking for another update and add it to the text view and scroll through it, so the marquee cant just roll over when its finished it must just display the next status. Is this possible to do using a scrollView or listView or something. It needs to scroll horizontally though. You dont have to show me how to parse the strings from the server or database or anything you can just use and arrayList or something.I just need to know how to constantly check for updates and then add it to the marquee without the marquee ever pausing or rolling over unless there are no new status updates. p  pIf you could do this it would be a TREMENDOUS help and in my eyes i would consider you a genius of the free world. Thank you people.p

Negative 834 pIm having lots of trouble building an appointment booking site for personal trainers.  To understand fully why Im having so much trouble please be patient and let me explain.  I wanted to use this free responsive calendar for the look and feel of my calendar because its responsive and I like the way it looks, although Ill make some minor alterations to it like color scheme.  If you go to the link below you will see a demo of itp  pa hrefhttptympanus.netDevelopmentCalendarioindex2.html relnofollowhttptympanus.netDevelopmentCalendarioindex2.htmlap  pIf you click back on the calendar arrow to November 2012, you will see that certain days have circles on them which indicate that there are events on those days.  If you click on the circle a window will come up which is supposed to provide info about the event.  The events are fetched from a JSON file whose format is the date for the keys and the values are URLs.  When a user clicks on an event instead of the window coming up I want them to be taken to a separate page which will list the available time slots for the trainer on that particular day.  Their availability will be based on two thingsp  p1 The schedule that they set for themselves like for instance Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays from 10am5pm.  I would provide a form on the site where they could set their schedule like this and then save it to a MySQL database and query that database to populate the JSON file.  p  p2 What appointment slots are booked on available days.  This is complicated since appointment times can vary.  A session can last 15, 30, 45 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours and 30 minutes, etc.  All in 15 minute chunks.  So for instance if the session that the user selected is a 1 hour session, I would have to query the schedule of the personal trainer and match that against his appointments booked on every single day and try to figure out where he has 1 hour slots available then show them to the user on a separate page after theyve clicked on the calendar date. p  pIm having lots of difficulty figuring this out.  I can populate the JSON file by querying the schedule of the personal trainer and then using a trick similar to the one below to get all the dates for the next year for a certain day that the trainer is available like for instance Saturday below.  Then store that info in the JSON file which will fetch the events for the calendar scriptp  precodeltphp  day    saturday step   1 unit   W  start  new DateTimeNOW end    clone start  startgtmodifyday  Move to first occurence of day endgtaddnew DateIntervalP1Y  Move to 1 year from start  interval  new DateIntervalPstepunit period    new DatePeriodstart, interval, end  foreach period as date  echo dategtformatD, d M Y, PHPEOL echo ltbr gt  gt codepre

Negative 834 pSince a week I cant access files in a WordPress subfolder through a php curl function. Interestingly it works when accessing the file with a browser. When adding a fake user agent header it works with the php curl function too. But I need other users to be able to retrieve the file without this hack. p  pI believe a WordPress update made those subfolders more secure by restricting access to only valid user agents Browsers. Also I believe that a specific htaccess configuration for this subfolder will open it up again for all user agents, but I have no idea how to write such a htaccess config. p  pDoes anyone have a cluep  pThanks Aleksp

I still think the problem is multidimensional, but I guess well just have to wait for the author to clarify  16  47497   Indeed, the only way to do this is get the server to generate your CSS file which can be done in many ways depending on which language you are using. HttpHandlers are common in C.  You could use jQuery or the likes to add styling to every element with the class ourColur and parametrise your JS 18  47513   This advice goes against the spirit of CSS, which is separation of content and presentation. You way requires changing HTML for presentation sake, and stating in content which elements have same color. pre  p...none of which contains the magic link or even the text codedontaskcode.p

Negative 834 pThis is slightly different from the standard a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq572002979202singleton patterna, in that if all external references to an object have released, then the singleton will be released, too. Then, later, when a new object is requested, a new singleton is created. So, something like thisp  precodeMyThing thing1  [MyThing new] MyThing thing2  [MyThing new]  thing1 amp thing2 are the same object.  thing1  nil thing2  nil  thing1  [MyThing new] thing2  [MyThing new]  thing1 and thing2 are a the same objet, but its a different object than above. codepre  pI tried to use a weak static variable to hang on to my scoped singleton, but that didnt work, since I have no way to increment the retain count under ARC. Which leaves me wondering is this even possiblep
Negative 834 h2EDIT based on the the answer, it seems that AngularJS is not faster than jQuery since it also uses a version of jQuery jqLite.h2  pA friend told me that jQuery can be slow because it needs to parse the entire HTML page for strongeachstrong request to be able to find the DOM objects and manipulate them. For a big page, it would get a bad performance.p  pHowever, AngularJS could be faster with big HTML pages because it compiles the HTML and has a faster access to DOM objects.p  pIs it true Could you please give a trustful link that confirms thatp  pIf this not true, please, give me an explanation regarding how jQuery and AngularJS are different regarding accessing DOM objects.p  pIve also seached by performance benchmarks and Ive only found this one a hrefhttpjsperf.comangularvsjqueryvsnative36 relnofollowlinka.p  pIf Angular is not faster than jQuery, why the test is wrongp

Negative 834 pI am trying to wrap my head around this. I have a codeQObjectcode derived class being used in QML, it has a codeint lengthcode member and a corresponding codelengthcode property.p  p90 of the times in QML Id set the property via a binding codelength 50code or codelength someJSExpressioncode, and in both cases the value is being determined by an expression, be that a trivial in the case of code50code.p  pBut what does this mean That the underling codeintcode remains unused and instead of reading the value from it, it is being evaluated from the bound expression, or that the expression is evaluated and the value is stored into the member, and then read from it p  pIn the first case the member would simply take up space without being used producing memory consumption overhead, in the second case the overhead will come from the redundant writeread instead of directly using the value from the expression without caching it in the member.p  pOn a deeper level, the question would extend to how bindings, which are purely QML thing and not used in the C API work, whether they substitute the underlying property member or work in tandem with it and the defined or implicit getter method.p  pAlso, is there a room for eliminating the overhead in the fist case I mean it is possible to implement a readonly property that doesnt use any underlying member and the getter method evaluates an expression to determine it, but in those cases in QML it wont be possible to use the other form, i.e. codelength  50code that imply sets the value rather than binding an expression to itp

Negative 834 pSo while trying to help a friend with there wordpress website I noticed something very strange in regards to the inspect element tool in IE vs other browers. When I inspect the title of his blog post with IEs inspect element tool it proceeds to say that the element Im inspecting is an h1 tag. But when I inspect that same element in other web browsers like firefox and chrome, their inspect element tools say its an h2 tag. What the heck is going on Is it something wrong with IE I dont understand how two different browsers come up with two differents answers for HTML elements. Thanks for any input.p

Negative 834 pI may have a workaround as a temporary fix, but this is going to cause problems if I cant get it fixed for good.p  pI have a query in MS Access that works just fine when its run on its own, but when I run it using the CurrentDb.Execute command, it gives the error Runtime error 3146 ODBCcall failed.p  pI also checked if it fails if its run from the Immediate window, and it does fail then, too.p  pThe query calls from three different tables plus one local table that was designed by the VBA script.  The VBA script works if one particular table is removed.p  pI know this is very generic, but why would the query work everywhere except if its called from VBAp  pUPDATE The original question was poorly worded, and I apologize for that.  It was written onthefly and I was frazzled by the problem I was having.p  pHere, emI thinkem, is the problem in a nutshell  If VBA calls a query that pulls from too many tables 3 or more on my companys server, it gives the call failed error.  If the query is just doubleclicked, it runs fine.p  pNow that Im thinking about it, could it be a serverside issuep  pThe workaround that Ive put in place is multiple queries that create local tables, then running the original query pointing to the local tables instead of the server tables.  It works, but is a very timeconsuming process, both in writing the code and running the code.  For this specific project that Im doing right now, itll work, but it would really be good to be able to get this working properly.p
Negative 834 pI am using ListView to display some data. The data is shown in TextView. String length which is shown can vary. so the textview which is shown changes its positions depending upon the length of the string. The problem I am facing is  Suppose there are 5 rows. For Row 3 if the text is long, the position of textview showing the text adjusts to show the content. However, textview positions of other rows also changes even if the text is smaller. This has something to do with ListView row caching strongI am not able to figure out how to reset the row.strongp  pRow Layoutp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt ltLinearLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid     androidorientationvertical     androidlayoutwidthmatchparent     androidlayoutheight100dpgt       ltLinearLayout         androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent         androidlayoutheightdimentextmarginbottom         androidorientationhorizontalgt          ltTextView             androidlayoutwidthfillparent             androidlayoutheightwrapcontent             androidididid1             androidtextSizedimentextsizecontent3 gt          ltView             androidlayoutwidth0dp             androidlayoutheight0dp             androidlayoutweight1 gt          ltTextView             androidlayoutwidthfillparent             androidlayoutheightwrapcontent             androidididid2             androidtextSizedimentextsizecontent3 gt     ltLinearLayoutgt      ltLinearLayout         androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent         androidlayoutheightdimentextmarginbottom         androidorientationhorizontalgt          ltTextView             androidlayoutwidthfillparent             androidlayoutheightwrapcontent             androidididid3             androidtextSizedimentextsizecontent3 gt          ltView             androidlayoutwidth0dp             androidlayoutheight0dp             androidlayoutweight1 gt          ltTextView             androidlayoutwidthfillparent             androidlayoutheightwrapcontent             androidididid4             androidtextSizedimentextsizecontent3 gt     ltLinearLayoutgt ltLinearLayoutgt codepre  pstrongGetView Codestrongp  precodepublic View getViewint position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent              ViewHolder holder             ShowData metaData  getItemposition              if convertView  null                  convertView  inflater.inflateR.layout.row, parent, false                 holder  new ViewHolder                  holder.id1  TextView convertView                         .findViewByIdR.id.id1                 holder.id2  TextView convertView                         .findViewByIdR.id.id2                 holder.id3  TextView convertView                         .findViewByIdR.id.id3                 holder.id3  TextView convertView                         .findViewByIdR.id.id4                 convertView.setTagholder              else                  holder  ViewHolder convertView.getTag                          convertView.invalidate             holder.id1.setTextmetaData.id1             holder.id2.setTextmetaData.id2             holder.id3.setTextmetaData.id3             holder.id4.setTextmetaData.id4             return convertView          codepre  pHow to reset the listview rowp

As bigint is not good choice for synchronization because of possibility primary key replica on different sites. I can not move on with GUID because for that i need to change my code as well as database which is not possible for me.p  pRight now i have two location only for database, so i think if can make my primary key auto increment to be always even at one location and to be odd at other location. It can solve my issue in quick manner.p  pHow can i do it using computed column specification or by any other way. For synchronization i am using Microsoft sycn framework. p  pIf i use identity1,2 A server or identity2,2 B server after synchronization it disturbs next increment value. For example if at A server max id 3 and at B server current id is 4. After sync max id on A server will be now 4. I want new id on A server should be 5 only but in reality it inserts 6. How can i solve this issuep

Negative 834 pI have a web application that is a single IIS installation This isnt changing, but has a dynamic collection of subdomains. Each subdomain has its own user accounts.p  pThe problem I am running into is that when I run signalR on it, it treats all subdomains as the same domain, so users who just so happen to have the same user name will get each others messages.p  pThis is causing me an security violation issue between domain accounts.p  pSo far my best guess solutions for this have different levels of risks and problems.p  ol liEach user gets their own group, build the group name with the subdomain name  user name. ol liList item this minimizes the risk of collision but doesnt remove it.li liUsing a Guid for the domain name, and reserving the first ncharacters for the guid reduces the risk even further, but now for each user online I now have a group formed.li olli liOn the owin start, spin up a new hub that represents each domain. ol liEach time I add a subdomain, I will have to restart the application to add the new hub. Right now, I dont have to do anything to add subdomains the DNS is supporting the wildcard, and the host header in IIS is blank. All works except for the lack of subdomain awareness in SignalR.li olli liBuild a custom hub class, that makes the client collection domain aware, like the rest of the application. ol liThis seems to be the cleanest, but by far, most time consuming. It also poses the highest risk of bugs, since I will have to compose a larger collection of QA tests beyond the TDD unit testing.li olli liLast option, dont use SignalR, build my own long poll API. ol liThis is the hardest one to accept, since it is the highest bandwidth and most exposed process. A basic survey of our target users shows that they are using websocket supporting browsers, so why would we purposely increase bandwidth or create new latency.li olli ol  pTo see this failure, just grab the simple chat demo at ASP.NETSignalR, and run it on your local computer under two different browsers FF and IE for my core tests, and have one call httplocalhost and the other call httpyourcomputername. You will need IIS not IIS Express for a proper test.p

Negative 834 pMy site has a fairly robust set of facets for our SOLR search. We use heirarchical categories, series, locations, authors, etc.... p  pWe wanted to add, to our top level search, the ability to not just search within the content of our site, but to search within the facets themselves. Meaning, if the user types in Mich they might find results on Michael Jordan or Michael Jackson, but they would also see probably divided into a different section that amongst our contributors are authors strongMichstrongael Thompson and Xavier strongMichstrongaelson and amongst our venues is Battle Creek, strongMichstrongigan.p  pNow, I could certainly just search against all of our database tables to find matches, but I was hoping that SOLR has a way of producing search results where facetsfields are the results.

Negative 834 pFirstly I am new to mongodb. The problem is mainly related to design and implementation. I am using mongoldb with spring data. I had a class named Page. It has an id and name fields. There is another class named Item and it has also an id field and content field. A page can contain many unbounded number of itemsJust like Likes on a Facebook page. Both Page and Item classes have corresponding mongo repositories. Below is the java code which I am using.p  precode    Document     public class Page      Id     private String id     private String name     public Page           public String getId          return id          public void setIdString id          this.id  id          public String getName          return name          public void setNameString name          this.name  name        Document public class Item       Id     private String id     private String content     public Item           public String getId          return id          public void setIdString id          this.id  id          public String getContent          return content          public void setContentString content          this.content  content        public interface PageRepository extends MongoRepositoryltPage, Stringgt   public interface ItemRepository extends MongoRepositoryltItem, Stringgt   codepre  pNow the problem is how do I store these items inside a page and access them. I want pagination access to the items inside a particular page and also be able to access items individuallyas which item corresponds to which page etc. One possible solution is to make an instance variable in Page class like codeListltItemgt itemscode but I think this is not the best approach as a page may contain many thousands of numbers of items.p

Negative 834 pIm using ASP.NET Web API and it conveniently automatically generates documentation for my API, but some of it doesnt make sense.p  pTake the below screenshot as an example.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com2bJD2.png altScreenshotp  pThis is an endpoint to codeGETcode a user by their ID, and in the codeResource Descriptioncode section its showing a table which shows the user models properties because my controller action has the code[ResponseTypetypeofUser]code annotation.p  pFirstly, in my actual controller action, Im stripping out the codePasswordcode property before displaying results to the user in order to not expose sensitive information. So the table given in the codeResource Descriptioncode section is incorrect, its saying my API returns fields that it doesnt.p  pSecondly, under the codeAdditional Informationcode column its showing the validation rules that go along with the codeUsercode model. Handy, but not at all relevant in this case as this endpoint is for codeGETcodeing a user, not codePOSTcodeing one.p  pSo, my question is how can I customize this codeResource Descriptioncode table to specify myself what fields get returned, and hide the EF validationsp  pIve currently commented my controller action like thisp  precode ltsummarygt  Get a single user identified by ID.  ltsummarygt  ltparam nameuserIdgtThe ID of the user.ltparamgt  ltreturnsgtA data collection about the user.ltreturnsgt [ResponseTypetypeofUser] [Routeapiv1usersuserId, NameGetUser] [HttpGet] public IHttpActionResult GetUserint userId       ...  codepre  pand Ive configured the help pages to read the documentation from an XML file which gets built from these codecode comments when I build the project.p  pThanksp

Negative 834 pSorry for the title gore, I did not know how to describe the problem in one line. If you have suggestions, Im open.p  pSuppose you have the following classp  precodepublic class SomeClass       doesnt even need to be final, which is freaky     Runnable memberRunnable  new Runnable          public void run              SomeOtherClass.someMethodmemberRunnable  this works                   public void someMethod          final Runnable varRunnable  new Runnable              public void run                  SomeOtherClass.someMethodvarRunnable  compiler error  varRunnable might not have been initialized                             codepre  pWhy is the codememberRunnablecode able to access itself from inside coderuncode, while codevarRunnablecode is not AFAICS its the exact same construct.p  pYou can obviously use codethiscode instead, I know. Im just wondering why the compiler makes a difference between the two cases, which seem identical. Also why it thinks codevarRunnablecode might not have been initialized, when its obvious that it is at that point.p  pOne could argue that, if codeRunnablecode was a class its an interface, its constructor might be trying to call coderuncode, thus actually running into a scenario where the reference is uninitialized. However, this should also be the case for codememberRunnablecode, but that case works.p  pFunny thing, nothing changes if instead of codeRunnablecode you use a class, in which case the above scenario constructor calling an overridden method can actually happen. This means that, in that case, you can run into a field not initialized at runtime havent tried it though, which is rather dumb since the compiler should guard against that.p

Negative 834 h2use caseh2  pI am creating an OpenGL context of the most recent by Qt supported version. currently 4.3, core profilep  pClasses using OpenGL functions receives a reference to the QOpenGLContext. Also they store a QOpenGLFunctions pointer using the version necessary for the class.p  precodeauto glFuncs  contextgtversionFunctionsltQOpenGLFunctions33Coregt codepre  pUsing this 3.3 core glFuncs pointer in an 3.4 core context leads to memory access violations.p  h2work around 1, showing another bugh2  pI thought than that the major version difference between the core profile context and the version functions is not supported, due to maybe even further deprecated functions. So i tried the followingp  pstrongsetupstrongp  ul lisetup the context as an 4.3 compatibility profile. li liusing functions with auto glFuncs  contextversionFunctionsli ul  pstrongbehaviorstrongp  pWhen the compatiblity flag is used to setup the QOpenGLContext, than the most recent driver supported context version is returned 4.5, compatibility. So the version specified with setMajorVersion and setMinorVersion are completely ignored. That leads to the situation of handling a more recent version than the current stable Qt lib release is able to handle. So the call to contextinitializeOpenGLFunctions crashes with an memory access violation. p  h2workaround 2, restricted behaviorh2  pSo currently i have to create the 4.3 core profile context and have to use for all version functions also the 4.3. core profile.p  precodeauto glFuncs  contextgtversionFunctionsltQOpenGLFunctions43Coregt  codepre  pThis way is very odd, because i have to use all the new 4.3 functions in classes even if they use only 3.3 functionality. It would be nice to see at the requested version function, which OpenGL version is actually necessary for that specific class. This is not a desirable situation, because it unnecessarily restricts the usage of OpenGL 3.3. hardware.p  pSo please correct me, if i misunderstood the usage of requesting different version functions than the context is created for. How do i achieve the situation of requesting the most current context whereas my classes use the version functions only in their needed versionp  pTo clarify it is really undesired behavior i filed a bug report at Qt a hrefhttpsbugreports.qt.iobrowseQTBUG46748 relnofollowhttpsbugreports.qt.iobrowseQTBUG46748ap

Negative 834 pI have two very simple objectsp  precodepublic class CategoryDto      public string Id  get set       public string MyValueProperty  get set    public class Category      public string Id  get set       [MapToMyValueProperty]     public string Key  get set   codepre  pWhen mapping a codeCategorycode to a codeCategoryDtocode with AutoMapper, I would like the following behavior  p  pThe properties should be mapped as usual, except for those that have the codeMapTocode attribute. In this case, I have to read the value of the Attribute to find the target property. The value of the source property is used to find the value to inject in the destination property with the help of a dictionary. An example is always better that 1000 words...p  pExamplep  precodeDictionaryltstring, stringgt keys       new Dictionaryltstring, stringgt   MyKey, MyValue    Category category  new Category category.Id  3 category.Key  MyKey  CategoryDto result  MapltCategory, CategoryDtogtcategory result.Id                Expected  3 result.MyValueProperty   Expected  MyValue codepre  pThe codeKeycode property is mapped to the codeMyValuePropertycode via the codeMapTocode Attribute, and the assigned value is MyValue, because the source property value is MyKey which is mapped via dictionary to MyValue.p  pIs this possible using AutoMapper  I need of course a solution that works on every object, not just on CategoryCategoryDto.p

Negative 834 pI have a database model with a positive integer column named weight. Theres also other columns but theyre not important for this problem. The weight column basically describes how important this row is. The higher the value of weight, the more important. The weight will only range from 0  3. The default is 0 least important.p  pId like to perform a query which selects 50 rows ordered by the weight column, but has been slightly randomised and includes rows with weights lower than whats in the results.p  pFor example, the first 50 rows ordered by weight may all have a weight of 3 and 2. The query needs to include mostly these results, but also include some with a weight of 1 and 0. They need to be slightly randomised as well so the same query wont always return the same results. Also, even though its limiting the results to 50, it needs to do this last, otherwise the same 50 results will be returned just in a different order.p  pThis will be integrated in a Django project, but the DB is MySQL, so raw SQL is OK.p  pPerformance is critical because this will happen on a landing page of a high traffic website.p  pAny ideas would be appreciated.p  pThanksp
Negative 834 pWe have a website running in azure as a Web App. Only 1 instance of the site is running. We are seeing regular downtimes for the site, and wondering why.p  pWe use Elmah to log exceptions, and before a downtime occurs we cant see any relevant or critical errors. What we do see however, is that AFTER the downtime, the site is back up but on another server. We can see this because the hostname of the server changes, and when an exception is thrown we can see in Elmah from which server it originated. Small examplep  precodeServer X Some small Exception thrown on server X, shows up in Elmah site goes down Site comes back up Server Y Some small exception thrown on server Y, shows up in Elmah codepre  pNow I know that azure has Rapid Fail Protection and Auto Healing, strongbut in our scenario, I cant tell the difference between our sitestrongp  pa moving to another server and going down because there is only 1     instance p  pb rapid fail protection or auto healing kicking inp  pIf its option a does anyone know based on what azure moves sitesp  pif its option b does anyone know how I can determine whyhow something triggered a rapid fail protection or auto healing kick in p

Negative 834 pRecently, I started studying SVG to build some Pie Charts. Although Im well aware that the world is full of readytouse libraries, my needs required that I implemented myself the SVG writter to build my graphs. Later on, those graphs are converted to PNG and shipped as email body while most libraries great for this are written in JS and emails cannot run JS for security reasons.p  pAnyway, now that my work is practically done and everything works great, I stumbled upon something I did not test while writing the library When you have only 1 data that takes 100 of the Pie Chart.p  pAs you can see a hrefhttpjsbin.comvivikosagaedithtml,output relnofollowherea, when you have a strongPathstrong defining the starting point and the ending point as the same, the result is just strongnothingstrong, even though I defined the Arc flag that refers to going the long path from start to end. I really dont want to rework my library in order to make a plain strongcirclestrong when the data represents 100 of the total. Do I have any viable solution with strongpathstrong tag onlyp  pThanks in advance.p

Bellow is a demo code, to illustrate my questionp  precodevar restify  requirerestify var Promise  requirebluebird  var server  restify.createServer   name myapp,   version 1.0.0   server.get, function req, res, next      new Promisefunctionresolve, reject         rejectnew Error     .thenfunctionres         res.sendhello     .catchfunctione         throw e        server.onuncaughtException, function req, res, route, error      console.logerror   server.listen7070, function     console.logs listening at s, server.name, server.url  codepre  pI am looking for a way to somehow pass the error to restify, so it will raise the codeuncaughtExceptioncode event and I could handle it like any other uncaught exception. After searching this a bit, I found that I can simply do something like codenextnew InternalServerErrorcode and restify will raise an event for this specific error, but this is look a bit weird to me, so I am looking for a better way. p

See belowp  precodeelse       If no sort description is detected, then make a manual sort for a column which does not have a IValueConverter     var column  dataGrid.Columns[0]      Add the new sort description     dataGrid.Items.SortDescriptions.Addnew SortDescriptioncolumn.SortMemberPath, ListSortDirection.Ascending     column.SortDirection  ListSortDirection.Ascending       Retry now to remove the sorting again     RemoveSortOnDataGriddataGrid            codepre  pNote that after I have added the new SortDescription, the view is not refreshed, so the reset of the sorting is not yet displayed to the user after this step. The user is not aware that a sort is made on the first column before he sees the final result displayed in the DataGrid.p  pThis is not the best solution, but until a more robust solution is provided, this one works.p

Negative 834 pIm writing a program for my TInspire calculator in TIBASIC, an optimised version of BASIC. From what I can tell, TIBASIC is a compiled language. I have had more experience working with scripting languages, where you can define i as i1, where the interpreter adds the previous value of i to 1 and makes that the new value of i. But since BASIC, from my understanding, is compiled, the calculator will set the value of i to the emequationem of i1 and loop.

Negative 834 pWe are experiencing the issue when trying to connect to the cluster after updating the version of Java SDK.p  pThe setup of the system is as followsp  pWe have a web application that is using Java SDK and a Couchbase cluster. In between we have a VIP Virtual IP Address. We realise that isnt ideal but were not able to change that immediately since VIP was mandated by Tech Ops. VIP is basically only there to reroute the initial request on application startup. That way we can make modifications on the cluster and ensure that when application starts it can find the cluster regardless of the actual nodes in the cluster and their IPs.p  pPrior to the issue we used JAVA SDK version 1.4.4. Our application would start and Java SDK would initiate a request on port 8091 to VIP. Please note that port 8091 is the only port open on VIP. VIP would reroute the request to one of the node cluster currently in use the cluster would respond to Java SDK. At that point Java SDK would discover all the nodes in the cluster and application would run fine. During up time if we would add, remove a node from the cluster Java SDK would update automatically and everything would run without the issue.p  pIn the last sprint we updated the Java SDK to version 2.1.3. Our application would start and Java SDK would initiate a request on port 11210 to VIP. Since this port is not open the request would fail and Java SDK would throw an exceptionp  precodeCaused by java.lang.RuntimeException java.util.concurrent.TimeoutException at com.couchbase.client.java.util.Blocking.blockForSingleBlocking.java93 at com.couchbase.client.java.CouchbaseCluster.openBucketCouchbaseCluster.java108 at com.couchbase.client.java.CouchbaseCluster.openBucketCouchbaseCluster.java99 at com.couchbase.client.java.CouchbaseCluster.openBucketCouchbaseCluster.java89 codepre  pNo further request would be made on any port.p  pIt appears the order in which port are being used has been changed between versions. Could somebody please confirm, or dispute, that the order in which ports are being used for cluster discovery has been changed between versions. Also could somebody please provide some advice on how we could resolve the issue. We are trying to understand the clients behavior, if we could open all those ports on the VIP would the client still then function correctly and at full performancep  pThe issue is happening on our production environment which we cannot use for testing out potential solutions since it will interfere with our products.p
Negative 834 pIm having trouble installing WordPress on my localhost development area. Everything is working fine, but when I want to move my site to an online environment problems are showing up with the DB collation.p  pI read about this and it seems that WordPress created tables on my localhost using the utf8mb4unicodeci charsetcollation.

Negative 834 pActiverecord generates parameterized queries for basic types, but, it does parametrize array types.p  pE.g.p  precodeArticle.whereid 1   generates  SELECT articles.
