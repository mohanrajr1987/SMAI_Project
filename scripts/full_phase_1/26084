Positive 26084 pI am trying to load an image 5.4 MB of resolution 4923 x 9405 on an image view. There is a drastic increase in the memory allocation of my app as soon as i load the image. The memory allocation before loading the image was around 17 MB, whereas it reaches 198 MB when i load my image on the image view. I was assuming that my app should consume a memory of 5 MB only while loading the image which proved to be wrong when i analysed the memory allocations of my app. p  pMy Questionsp  ul listrongWhy does my iOS app shows such behaviourstrongli listrongIs there any way to identify, what will be the actual memory allocation of the app when any such large images are loadedstrongli ul  pYou can check the attached screenshots for memory allocations before loading the image and after loading the image.p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comK1GE0.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comK1GE0.png altMemory allocation before loading the imageap  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comPoJZC.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comPoJZC.png altMemory allocation after loading the imageap

Positive 26084 pIve got a set of UIImageViews contained inside of a UIScrollView. For some reason, when I go to have Voice Over read all the elements on the page, it does not read the ImageView like it should.

Positive 26084 pWhen I debug my views in Xcode, my codeUIImageViewcode has the following Auto Layout constraintsp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.com4wd0S.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com4wd0S.png altenter image description hereap  pIm expecting the width and height which are initialised to 6 on the views setter. At the point of debugging these constraints should be 40 instead of 6. But for some reason there are extra constraints for width and height for content size that are actually set to 40.p  pThis is my codeimageViewcodes codedidSetcode method for the codeIBOutletcodep  precodeIBOutlet private weak var imageView UIImageView      didSet          if let widthConstraint  imageView.constraintForLayoutAttribute.Width                      widthConstraint.constant  MinimumImageLength             imageView.layoutIfNeeded                  else                      let widthConstraint  NSLayoutConstraintitem imageView, attribute .Width, relatedBy .Equal, toItem nil, attribute .NotAnAttribute, multiplier 1, constant MinimumImageLength             NSLayoutConstraint.activateConstraints[widthConstraint]                   if let heightConstraint  imageView.constraintForLayoutAttribute.Height                      heightConstraint.constant  MinimumImageLength             imageView.layoutIfNeeded                  else                      let heightConstraint  NSLayoutConstraintitem imageView, attribute .Height, relatedBy .Equal, toItem nil, attribute .NotAnAttribute, multiplier 1, constant MinimumImageLength              NSLayoutConstraint.activateConstraints[heightConstraint]                codepre  pWhich gets a width and height constraint if they exist and set its minimum width. As a note, in my view I have explicitly set these width and height constraints and so my code never enters the codeelsecode in both width and height.p  pTo get the right constraint I use the following functionp  precodeextension UIView      func constraintForLayoutAttributelayoutAttribute NSLayoutAttribute gt NSLayoutConstraint              let filteredArray  constraints.filter  0.firstAttribute  layoutAttribute           return filteredArray.first       codepre  pLater on I use the same function to get the widthheight and change both constants. I call codelayoutIfNeededcode after updating the widthheight constraints. Ive also tried debugging by also calling codesetNeedsUpdateConstraintscode with no luck.p  pInterestingly, constraints work as expected if I test by removing the image from the codeUIImageViewcode and just set a background colour so I can see whats happening.p  pDoes anyone know why this might be happeningp

Positive 26084 pI had the opportunity today to try the caching system of my application and it seems it does not work as expected ...p  pI am using the wellknown setImageWithURL method to display images in every cells of a UITableView as followp  precode reset cell image to make sure reused cell starts fresh [cell.profilePic setImagenil]  profilePic of user [cell.profilePic setImageWithUrl[NSURL ...]] codepre  pThe documentation says the followingp  blockquote   pAsynchronously downloads an image from the specified URL, and sets it   once the request is finished. Any previous image request for the   receiver will be cancelled. If the image is cached locally, the image   is set immediately, otherwise the specified placeholder image will be   set immediately, and then the remote image will be set once the   request is finished. By default, URL requests have a Accept header   field value of image  , a cache policy of NSURLCacheStorageAllowed   and a timeout interval of 30 seconds, and are set not handle cookies.p blockquote  pI turned off wifi on my iphone and rescrolled the UITableView and everything disappears ... I would have expected everything to stay. Do I need to configure something for the cache Or is AFNetworking supposed to handle everything by itself I have nothing else than these two lines of code and did not do any configuration regarding caching system. It is all default.p

Their shape resembles that of a rhombus with rounded edges. p  pAnd after I scroll up and down again so that the top cells become temporarily out of sight, the cells which were out of sight are now perfect circles.p  pHere is my code for the cell classp  precodeclass FavouritesCollectionViewCell UICollectionViewCell      IBOutlet weak var profilePicutreImageView UIImageView     IBOutlet weak var nameLabel UILabel      override var bounds CGRect          didSet              contentView.frame  bounds                    override func layoutSubviews          profilePicutreImageView.layer.borderWidth  2.0         profilePicutreImageView.layer.masksToBounds  false         profilePicutreImageView.layer.cornerRadius  profilePicutreImageView.frame.width2         profilePicutreImageView.layer.borderColor  UIColor.blackColor.CGColor         profilePicutreImageView.clipsToBounds  true        codepre  pAny ideas about what this may be p  pUPDATEHere are the pictures of what is happeningp  pBefore a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comosqNu.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comosqNu.png altenter image description hereap  pAfter a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comensy3.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comensy3.png altenter image description hereap
Positive 26084 pI have a codeUIImageViewcode inside a codeUIScrollViewcode and I would like the user to be able to zoom in on the image. So far, the zooming works, but I began noticing some extra space in the scroll views codecontentSpacecode. Initially, I thought this was due to codecontentOffsetcode issues or the like, but after debugging I discovered that aspect ratio of the image view changes after zooming. Initially, the image view fits the image, but, after zooming, the aspect ratio of the image view becomes square. Since the viewed image is rectangular, there is some extra space in the image view. How can this be fixed p

Negative 26084 pThe using... statement is syntactic sugar for try finally .p  pBut if I then have a using statement like belowp  precodeusing FileStream fs  File.Openpath     codepre  pNow I want to catch the exceptions that opening this file could cause and this is fairly high risk code in that it can fail due to the environment, but if I write trycatch inside would that not be repetition When the code gets compiled to IL, I assume the repetition will get deleted when the code is JITtedp  pHowever, I would want to catch the exceptions opening a file can cause so I should wrap the trycatch outside the using statements scope, and also the exceptions for whatever I do inside the using block so I should add the trycatch inside the block.p  pThis seems like I am adding a lot of repetition to what the CLR probably does inside. Does the CLR add catch clausesp  pMy colleague argued that a using statement is messy but this was because a single line was slightly long due to me hard coding them as I needed to change them very quickly and didnt have access to other parts of the code base. Said colleague doesnt use the using statement but is there ever any functional difference between the using statement and tryfinallytrycatchfinally I did see one case of this where WCF services have a not well known corner case about using finally and returning values something about finally. The solution was to use a check block. Is there anything like this in Cp  pOn another note, are all types which implement IDisposale owners of unmanaged resources A discussion with my friend pointed the answer to being no.

Negative 26084 pI am unclear on how to post to twitter using oauth. Please do not just post a link on this page for me to look at because chances are I have already seen it. I have the section where they go to twitter and approve the app and come back to my site. I then store the information in access key and access secret key in the database from the user. I can then post to twitter using curl but I am using the users username and password to post it which doesnt seem correct. But anyways the main problem with this is that it is not showing the posted from link and I am never using the access key and access secret key because I do not know where or how to use them. Any help is appreciated.p

Negative 26084 pIm developing an application that uses ubiquityxforms. Previously I had been serving the pages up as texthtml with the XHTML 1.0 doctype.p  pIf I switched the mimetype to applicationxhtmlxml, I would see a pretty big performance improvement, because the javascript could use the getNS functions, instead of what its doing now slowly iterating through the entire DOM tree every time it needs to select an element.p  pBut when I tried this, a bunch of my CSS stopped working. I noticed that when I inspected the elements, either in Firebug or in the WebKit Nightly Web Inspector, the point of failure were .classname and id css selectors on elements in the XFORMS namespace. I also noticed that in the listed DOM properties for those elements they were lacking both id and className attributes.p  pMy question is, is there a way that I can get the UA to recognize these as classes and ids p  pThings Ive tried, to no availp  ol lispecifying the id attributes as ID in an inline doctypes ATTLISTli litrying every doctype I could, or no doctype at allli liqualifying the id and class name attributes in the xhtml namespace ie. xhtmlidli ol  pHeres some sample xhtml.

Negative 26084 pIs it possible to create an image gallery in wordpress that is managed by the admin via its own page  panel.  I am not talking about creating a new post and adding custom html for each image.

Negative 26084 pI have two columns the left one is a Canvas containing an mxTree and the right one is a Canvas containing a Canvas to allow for scrolling of some custom Sprites that go along with the tree nodes on the left.

Unfortunately, the customer requires dynamic HTML to overlap the Flash at times and when using wmodeopaque or transparent, there are issues.

Negative 26084 pI am writing a PHPMySQL application using CodeIgniter that uses some jQuery functionality for dragging table rows. I have a table in which the user can drag rows to the desired order kind of a queue for which I need to preserve the rank of each row. Ive been trying to figure out how to and whether I should update the database each time the user drops a row, in order to simplify the UI and avoid a Save button.p  pI have the jQuery working and can send a serialized list back to the server onDrop, but is it good design practice to run an update query this often The table will usually have 3040 rows max, but if the user drags row 1 far down the list, then potentially all the rows would need to be updated to update the rank field. p  pIve been wondering whether to send a giant query to the server, to loop through the rows in PHP and update each row with its own Update query, to send a small serialized list to a stored procedure to let the server do all the work, or perhaps a better method I havent considered. Ive read that stored procedures in MySQL are not very efficient and use a separate process for each call. Any advice as to the right solution here Thanks very much for your helpp
Negative 26084 pFrom the docsp  blockquote   pIf you change the input value in a   validateerror method, you must   ensure that you only change the value   if it is invalid or uncoerced. The   reason is that, since the object and   context are now dirtied, Core Data may   validate that key again later. If you   keep performing a coercion in a   validation method, this can therefore   produce an infinite loop.p blockquote  pSo when I modify a value in a validation method, the context gets dirtied And the next time I save, the validation happens again  and when I change the value even if the validation is OK, then the context is again dirtied, and revalidated again  and I change the value, and Core Data validates, again, because the context is dirtied. And so on...for ever... is that right Or did they try to say something differentp

For TCP, the   SOKEEPALIVE socket option should be   set either before the connect function   connect, ConnectEx, WSAConnect,   WSAConnectByList, or WSAConnectByName   is called, or after the connection   request is actually completed. If the   connect function was called   asynchronously, then this requires   waiting for the connection completion   before trying to set the SOKEEPALIVE   socket option. If an application   attempts to set the SOKEEPALIVE   socket option when a connection   request is still in process, the   setsockopt function will fail and   return WSAEINVAL.p blockquote

Negative 26084 pOn a Ruby on Rails development environment, a page will be shown after 30 seconds on Firefox, but takes 90 seconds on IE 8 with IE 7 Compatibility Mode.p  pFurther investigation shows that it should be Javascript that slowed down the page, because if Javascript is turned off, then the page content will also show in 30 seconds.p  pBecause there are probably 7 or 8 jQuery plugins, Facebook scripts, and Google Analytics script, it would take quite some time to move all the Javascript code to the end of the HTML file, which should speed up the page content view so that content is shown after 30 seconds, just like Firefox, is there a way to force IE to show page content before finish executing all the Javascript codep  pI think IE might be waiting for all Javascript code to finish first, because what if there are codedocument.writecode statements, which should be within the HTML... Firefox or Chrome doesnt wait for that but display the content right away.p  pon the production server, the page will be displayed on Firefox after 5 to 7 seconds, because a lot of the partials HTML subcomponents are cached.  IE 8 takes a lot longer too, about 40 seconds or so.p  pstrongP.S.strong  A strong reason why the Javascript is embedded throughout the HTML may be that, say if there is an Image Carousel, then the HTML code is in a partial, which is an HTML file generated by an HAML file, and all the HTML as well as the Javascript code are in this file, for better encapsulation, instead of having HTML in one file, and the Javascript in another file, but I wonder what if all these Javascript code blocks only use jQuerys codedocument.readyfunction  ... code, then will these code block slow down the page display on IEp

Negative 26084 pIn a nutshell, I need a way to stream or otherwise play a movie along with 3 to 4 other show angles, with the user being able to change the stream theyre viewing. End result should be a video player with linksbuttons for the other angles, allowing the user to switch camera streams angles as they wish.p  pstrongHeres an examplestrong You load a page with a DIY video.. and since it includes a fairly detailed assembly process, there are 4 cameras recording different angles or locations of the work area straight on  aka main camera, one above the work area, one to the left side angle and one to zoom on presenter. p  pThe main video is displayed when the page loads,. but you can switch to the other views at the click of a button.. without waiting for that new angle video to buffer. Since each angle will essentially be a separate streamvideo file, the only thing I have come up with is to stream them simultaneous and when the users click the button for a specific stream, use JS to showhide the corresponding video  which is by far NOT the most efficient for load time or BW usage.. p  pSo, Im hoping to get some feedback and advice on other ways to implement this type of video playback feature on the site. Well can implement this in FlashFlex, PHP or Ruby RoR as far as programming languages, so if you have something specific to those languages that would be especially helpful, but we are open to any suggestionsp  pstrongNOTEstrong Im also interested to hear any suggestions on hardware setup. Since a setup like this can range from the mild to the wild, itll be helpful to know that we plan on starting with a very basic setup  34 high quality web cams fed into a single computer with audio being provided by one of the cams or a lapel mic. Once we get the show going, well progress to a more professional level setup with DV cameras and XLR fed audio... but, not at the start. So, any advice on hardware to pull this off to start is GREATLY appreciated.  Sorry for the novel, I wanted to make sure to clarify this so you guys dont have to ask a bunch of questions about what Im trying to accomplish. p  pstrongP.S.strong We can use PC or Mac, or both for the video CAPTURE implementation and we have linux servers for the STREAMING implementationp

Negative 26084 pIs there a tool which can handle model checking large, realworld, mostlyC, distributed systems, such as KDEp  pKDE is a distributed system in the sense that it uses IPC, although typically all of the processes are on the same machine. Yes, by the way, this is a valid usage of distributed system  check Wikipedia.p  pThe tool would need to be able to deal with intraprocess events and interprocess messages.p  pLets assume that if the tool supports C, but doesnt support other stuff that KDE uses such as moc, we can hack something together to workaround that.p  pI will happily accept less general e.g. static analysers specialised for finding specific classes of bugs or more general static analysis alternatives, in lieu of actual model checkers.

Negative 26084 pWhat I have is a Windows form, in C, with 7 text boxes. Each text box updates 2 or 3 others when its value is changed and accepted. What I want to do is somehow take those text boxes that need to be updated and make them flash with a light back color or something. The purpose is to show the user what is being updated with an added bit of flair.p  pIm not sure if there is an easy way to do this and that is why Im asking here. I can use a timer, a while loop, and a back color with a decreasing alpha channel on the text box control back color, I think, but I want to see if there is a better way.p  pjQuery UI has a Highlight effect that shows what I want to accomplish although I want mine to be a bit slower. Just go here to the a hrefhttpjqueryui.comdemoseffect relnofollowjQuery UI Effects Demo pagea, select highlight from the dropdown box in the window, and click Run Effect.p  pbEditbbr I had to go with my own solution based on my time and resource constraints, but text boxes do not support transparent colors as mentioned by Hans Passant. So, I used a selfstopping timer that increases the R, G, and B values until the control is completely white R255, G255, B255p  pbEdit 2bbr Wound up recoding the flash event as an extension method using a variation of George Johnstons solution after we updated to .NET 4.0. This is a much cleaner solution, I feel, and the extension method makes it automatically available to anyone codeusingcode it.p
Negative 26084 pHeres the situation.  I have a base class which implements a method that accepts a string, and sets a property to the value of that string.  Under that, I have a group of concrete classes that implement the base.  Some of the concrete classes can accept any string value to be stored.  However, some of the classs values are constrained within an Enumerated series of values.  The final value is still a string, but the value must be within that enumerated set of possible values.p  pHeres what Id like to do  For the classes which use an enumrestricted value, I want to implement an overload to the string method that calls the string method with the correct value.  However, I also want to lock the string implementation out so that only the enum implementation can be used to pass a new value in, in order to enforce the enum restriction.p  pI know at this point that this just isnt going to happen through the use of override or new in the method declaration.  I also know that I could create a hierarchy like Base  [BaseStringBaseEnum]  Concrete and use sealing to keep the concrete implementation from allowing the stringbased implementation to be used.  What Id like to know is if theres another way to do this that skips the extra level of hierarchy and allows me to just say If method overload is present in concrete class, lock method.p  precodepublic class Abstract      public virtual string ValueHolder  get privateprotected set      public virtual void DoSomething string s   ...    public class ConcreteEnum  Abstract      public void DoSomething Enum e            base.DoSomething String somehow extracted from enum        public class ConcreteString  Abstract  ...   public class Main      ConcreteString sc  new ConcreteString     ConcreteEnum se  new ConcreteEnum      sc.DoSomething I dont have an overload defined,          so Im using my bases string handler method.           I can be any value, I have no restrictions.       se.DoSomething SomeEnum.MyValueWillBeRunThroughTheBaseStringHandler      se.DoSomething I dont work because theres an         overload defined in my concrete class, and my         value is restricted to a specific set of         possibilities.   codepre  pAs I said, I know that there are other viable ways of doing this, I just want to know if this is possiblemore clean than those alternatives.p

The relationship between the two is a 1 to many.  The EDM generated properties to navigate back and forth between these two entities.  For example, in HeaderTable, I have a property called DetailTables that is a collection of all the DetailTalbe entities for the current HeaderTable entity. p  pKeeping it simple, from the client I want to return ALL of the HeaderTable entities.  I do it like thisp  precodepublic void TestFromClient    if context  null                context  new TestContext     EntityQueryltHeaderTablegt query  context.GetHeaderTablesQuery     context.LoadltHeaderTablegtquery    codepre  pWithin my callback method I do in fact get a collection to all the HeaderTable items.  However, the property DetialTables which should hold all of my detail records is empty.  Since these entities are related, I figured I would get them during the query.  So, once I found I was not getting these entities, I made changes to my GetHeaderTables on the server as followsp  precodepublic IQueryableltHeaderTablegt GetHeaderTables    return this.ObjectContext.HeaderTable   Original   return this.ObjectContext.HeaderTable.IncludeDetailTables  codepre  pThis should now be explicitly bringing back my details within my headers, but just like my first attempt, by the time it gets to the client, the DetailTalbles property within my HeaderTable property is empty. Just as a test, I decided to see what was going on within the server function GetHeaderTables and did this so I could debug the valuep  precodepublic IQueryableltHeaderTablegt GetHeaderTables    return this.ObjectContext.HeaderTable   Original   return this.ObjectContext.HeaderTable.IncludeDetailTables   ListltHeaderTablegt test  this.ObjectContext.HeaderTable.IncludeDetailTables.ToList  codepre  pSure enough, all of my HeaderTable entities had a valid DetailTables property with a collection of all the details.  So, it is working on the server, but it is not working on the client.  I am clearly missing something, but I cant figure out what. If anyone can see what I am doing wrong or have advice for going at this a different way, Im all ears.p  pAs a side note, I also cant figure out why I am not able to specify the Include on the client side context.  Why only the server  Man, Im lostp  pScottp
Negative 26084 pWe have a 32bit ATL outproc COM server. In order to register itself in the registry it calls codeCComModuleUpdateRegistryFromResourcecode and passes an id of a .rgs file compiled into the resources of the same executable.p  pWorks great on 32bit systems, but not on 64bit ones. Obviously when a 32bit .exe runs on a 64bit Windows its registry accesses are redirected and so it registers itself in 32bit HKCR and so 64bit programs dont see its registration.p  pHow do I register the same outproc server in the 64bit HKCR the cheapeast and most reliable wayp
Negative 26084 pWhile revising some old c code, I ran across several a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiBitfieldbitflagsa defined as enums.p  precodeenum FooFlags      FooFlag1  1 ltlt 0,     FooFlag2  1 ltlt 1,     FooFlag3  1 ltlt 2      etc...  codepre  pThis isnt uncommon, but it bothered me that as soon as you start to combine flags, you lose the type information.p  precodeint flags  FooFlag1  FooFlag2    Weve lost the information that this is a set of flags relating to Foo codepre  pSome searching on SO showed that Im not the a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1693579bitflagenumsinconlya a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions199606howshouldcbitflagenumerationsbetranslatedintoconea bothered by this.p  pOne alternative is to declare flags as defines or const integrals, so bitwise operations wouldnt transform the type probably.  The problem with this is it allows our bit set to commingle with unrelated flags, via ints or other enums.p  pIm familiar with a hrefhttpwww.cplusplus.comreferencestlbitsetstdbitseta and a hrefhttpwww.boost.orgdoclibs1360libsdynamicbitsetdynamicbitset.htmlboostdynamicbitseta, but neither are designed to address my issue.  What Im looking for is something like Cs a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.flagsattribute.aspxFlagsAttributea.p  pMy question is, what other solutions are there for a more type safe set of bitflagsp  pIll post my own solution below.p
Negative 26084 pI need to load a dll within another dll Visual C both, so I can use the classes embedded in the first one in the second.

Negative 26084 pI am developing app which has bluetooth communication involved. The bluetooth communication should go on even if the Activity that sets up the connection closes down. First, I have thought of using Service for this and that seemed to be right way. But, in Bluetooth chat example the communication happens in another thread and not in Service. I have used that code in my app and its working properly. Is using Thread for bluetooth communication proper or do I need to make use of Service only The bluetooth communication should be active till my app is in RAM and it should not matter if I switch between activities.p

Negative 26084 pI have a feeling this has already been answered, but I dont know the correct terminology involved and couldnt find anything in my search.p  pIm working on a product recommendation system.  And Ive got a database of items, and Im running through and determining which items are similar. For example ItemID 1 is similar to 5, 7, and 8.  The issue is the data being redundant. As I loop through the whole item set ill wind up with something like this  p  p1 5,7,8br 5 7,8,1br 7 8,5,1br 8 5,1,7  p  pWhat is the best way to store this in MySQL, so I can query it and find the items related to either 1, 5, 7, or 8.  In real life, there will be an uneven number of items in each set.  Im concerned with speed more than storage space, but it seems like there should probably be a happy medium, or if Im lucky one that is fast, and saves space.p
Negative 26084 pI need to create a web app that allows the user to graphically analyze multivariate data. In my vision, the users will select three out of the many available variables that they want to see, and the app will plot them. After that the users will get the opportunity to interactively explore the graphs.p  pThere is a a hrefhttpbiomodel.uah.esJmolplotsphasediagramsinicio.htm relnofollowsitea that demonstrates using a hrefhttpjmol.sourceforge.net relnofollowJMola  an opensource Java viewer for chemical structures in 3D to plot data in 3d. The a hrefhttpbiomodel.uah.esJmolplotsphasediagramsinicio.htm relnofollowresulta is pretty neat, but I would feel more comfortable to use a tool that is dedicated to plotting data, as I suspect such a tool would be more easy to operate and would provide more options. Unfortunately, I  cannot find any alternative that will both work in 3D and will provide interactive access to the plot. Do you have any suggestionsp

Negative 26084 pI am wondering what difference it makes to the debugger Intellij IDEA  Scala plugin when I debug Scala code and not Java code. To my understanding, a debugger is tightly coupled with the language i.e. a Java debugger can not handle Scala code but apparently the JVM is the center of attention here meaning as long as it is bytecode, any debugger would do. right p  pIMPORTANT UPDATE The problem was to give an example of how a bytecode debugger may be limiting for Scala. Assume a break point is reached and I dont want to go to the next line but I want the debugger to evaluate an Scala expression in the context of the application e.g. I like to call an operator method from a singleton object. The debugger is stuck because it can not understand Scala. I have to do the transformation myself and input the resulting Java to the debugger. The problem is that only breakpoint stuff could be handled in bytecode level. What if you want to put an expression under watch Debugger has to understand Scala to evaluate the watched expression,right This time Im sure Im right. Vengeance is mine, Saith the Lord  p

Negative 26084 pIm pretty new to iphone development, so this is more of a highlevel question.

Im trying to figure out if I should progress further down that path or look into things like CALayers, Core Graphics, etc. Any guidance or advice would be greatly appreciated.

Negative 26084 pIm trying to create a sitemap of my website which shows all the pages of my site all at once, with lines showing which pages link to where. p  pI created a sitemap using Microsoft Visio 2010, but the problem is that it shows only 12 pages at first and you have to double click on each page to expand it and see the pages it links to, which continues on and a page can be repeatedly listed by expanding other sites that link to it. p  pDoes anyone know of how I can create a sitemap which shows all pages all at once, without needing to expand any further, and that shows connections between sitesp  pThanksp

Negative 26084 pI have an excel document with 10000 rows of data in two sheets, the thing is one of these sheets have the product costs, and the other has category and other information. These two are imported automatically from the sql server so I dont want to move it to Access but still I want to link the product codes so that when I merge the product tables as product name and cost on the same table, I can be sure that Im getting the right information.p  pFor examplep  precodeCode  name      category   1     mouse     OEM 4     keyboard  OEM 2     monitor   screen  Code  cost         1     123        4     1234       2     1232       7     587       codepre  pLets say my two sheets have tables like these, as you can see the next one has one that doesnt exist on the other I put it there because in reality one has a few more, preventing a perfect match. Therefore I couldnt just sort both tables to AZ and get the costs that way as I said there are more than 10000 products in that database and I wouldnt want to risk a slight shift of costs with those extra entries on the other table that would ruin the whole table. p  pSo what would be a good solution to get the entry from another sheet and inserting it to the right row when merging Linking two tables with field name... checking field and trying to match it with the other sheet... Anything at all.p  pNote When I use Access I would make relationships and when I would run a query it would match them automatically... I was wondering if theres a way to do that in excel too.p

Negative 26084 pWell im currently developping a browser multiplayers game and having some problem about the conception. This is a Ogame like httpwww.ogame.org using PHP  Js  MySql.p  pWhat i want is that players will launch an action cut the wood and this action will be ending in XX minutes. p  pSo basicely my idea was to create an on the fly cron which will launch after XX minutes a SQL query, adding in the DB XX ressources to the player.p  pAnother problem is that players can navigate on the sea with their ship, so if they are moving to a certain destination they will make XX meter each 5 minutes for example.p  pSo the thing is that all the players can see each others on the sea. So basicaly, i cant wait for 10 minutes to add XX meter to the player ship, it have to be done after 5 minutes...p  pEDIT  So basicely i need a MySql job like or a infinite loop whos constantly checking on a table. This table will contain the end time timestamp of all the actions. And so the job have to execute a Sql Query when this time is corresponding to the CURRENTTIME.p  pHope you guys have understood my problem p

I have spotted some example of a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8565521registrycontextmenuextensionofsdffilescomment116709188565521some programmatic modification of the registry herea, but I need to be able to retrieve the location at which the user chooses to install during the install wizard process, so that I can refer to this location to point to my .exe in from the registry key. How can I do that  Where can I plug some code in an install wizard p  pUPDATE  img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comxcpsP.png altenter image description herep

Negative 26084 pIm developing some polyglot Java  Clojure code using the REPL most of the time in Eclipse with CounterClockwise and Maven.

Negative 26084 pIm currently trying to set up an offline symbols server that will serve up symbols much the same as Microsofts own symbol server works.p  pIn essence, I would like to have the ability to use srvCsymbolcachehttpmy.symbol.server as my symbol path in windbg.  I have IIS up and running and added a MIME type for .pdb files.p  pI used symstore to add the symbols from various flavors of Windows and then updated my symbols bath in windbg to no avail.p  pSince Im using several different OSes, the symbols directory just contains .PTR files to the actual location of the .pdb  which I think is my problem.p  pAs an example, in my symbols folder I have a folder called mswrd6.pdb which contains 4 directories that are all 32 character hex, each one of those directories contains a file.ptr file which points to the correct location of the desired .pdb.p  pLong story short, does anyone know of a guide or documentation out there that goes through how to create a symbols server over httpp  pThanksp

Negative 26084 pIve searched around quite a bit for ways to do this and I finally decided to just write text by loading it from a bitmap image. This is my first go at loading separate regions of an image and using a bitmap, so I know I have some mistakes in my algorithm. Some major ones I would bet but I did it the best way I could think of how. IF someone would tell me what Im doing wrong and point me in the right direction to figuring this out that would be great. From what I can tell when I send the information into the render it is correct, I get the right character and the right x,y position to translate it too, and the texture is loading just fine as well.

Negative 26084 h2 Symptom h2  pI think, I messed up something, because both Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome produce the same error they dont receive the whole response the webserver sends them.

Also, the webserver does not emcloseem the socket, just at the end.p  pWhy Im doing this way the program I write is designed for nonlinux system, it will run on an embedded computer. It has not too much memory, which is mostly occupied by emlwIPem stack. So, avoid collecting the  relativelly  huge webpage, I send it in parts. Browsers like it, no broken HTML occurred as under Linux.p  h2 Environment h2  pThe platform is GNULinux Ubuntu 32bit with 3.0 kernel.

Enter new email address into text field and click the save button. The button then calls a method from the singleton class which sends the new email address to the server and via the URL and receives a XML response confirming the change.p  pHere are my problems 1. I start the spinner from the view controller before I make the singleton class method call  but not knowing when the app to server sendreceive is finished, how do I make the spinner stop at the right time I cant of it from the singleton class, I tried that. From what I know, it has to be from within the VC or is there a way to change VC output from my singleton classp  ol lipThe singleton class NSURLConnection is handling ALL of my communication. Everything from a simple, email change all the way to updating transaction tables. This just seems wrong to me and makes it very difficult to keep track on who is calling what. Again, I am going by my interpretation of MVC. I think it would be much easier to have a NSURLConnection for every VC and do some processing in those classes. However that would not be MVCish.pli lipI have close to a 100 variables, arrays, etc in my singleton class which I use to assign values to all my VC. This also seems wrong to me but I cant think of any other way.pli ol

Negative 26084 pIm having some trouble using EF Code First to model a graph structure.

Each Edge has a SourceNode, a DestinationNode and a RelationshipType used for weighting.p  pI know how I would model this as a straight Databasefirst development, with a table for Edge that would have a surrogate key, SourceObjectID and DestinationObjectID fields which would be the PKs from the objects being linked, SourceObjectType and DestinationObjectType fields which are the type of object being related, but the site requires EF Code First implementation.p  pIve got it to a point where Im using TPT inheritance, so Ive got a GraphNode table with a PK thats the GraphNodeID, but its then using this as the PK for each of the tables for the concrete types, in place of their own PKs which is going to cause problems.p  pHas anyone done this, or can anyone point me in the right direction for a way to do this  p

My app tries to authenticate with FB, but doesnt return auth tokens. Something else that I noticed is that...p  ol lipIf I have the facebook app installed... it switches to it, shows a white loading screen for a second, then dismisses it and pops back to my app.pli lipIf the facebook app isnt installed... it will open in safari and actually show the app approval window, let me login and then it pops back to my app.pli ol  pBoth ways fail with getting and storing the auth tokens however.p  pWhat the heck am I doing wrong Would someone mind seeing if this code works for themp  pFull source here Deleted.p  pThanks for looking.p

It contains the      configuration directives that give the server its instructions.      See ltURLhttphttpd.apache.orgdocs2.2gt for detailed information.      In particular, see       ltURLhttphttpd.apache.orgdocs2.2moddirectives.htmlgt      for a discussion of each configuration directive.           Do NOT simply read the instructions in here without understanding      what they do.  Theyre here only as hints or reminders.  If you are unsure      consult the online docs. You have been warned.             Configuration and logfile names If the filenames you specify for many      of the servers control files begin with  or drive for Win32, the      server will use that explicit path.  If the filenames do not begin      with , the value of ServerRoot is prepended  so logsfoo.log      with ServerRoot set to Cxamppapache will be interpreted by the      server as Cxamppapachelogsfoo.log.           NOTE Where filenames are specified, you must use forward slashes      instead of backslashes e.g., capache instead of capache.      If a drive letter is omitted, the drive on which httpd.exe is located      will be used by default.  It is recommended that you always supply      an explicit drive letter in absolute paths to avoid confusion.            ServerRoot The top of the directory tree under which the servers      configuration, error, and log files are kept.           Do not add a slash at the end of the directory path.  If you point      ServerRoot at a nonlocal disk, be sure to point the LockFile directive      at a local disk.  If you wish to share the same ServerRoot for multiple      httpd daemons, you will need to change at least LockFile and PidFile.          ServerRoot Cxamppapache            Listen Allows you to bind Apache to specific IP addresses andor      ports, instead of the default. See also the ltVirtualHostgt      directive.           Change this to Listen on specific IP addresses as shown below to       prevent Apache from glomming onto all bound IP addresses.

UserGroup The name or number of the usergroup to run httpd as.      It is usually good practice to create a dedicated user and group for      running httpd, as with most system services.          User daemon     Group daemon      ltIfModulegt     ltIfModulegt       Main server configuration           The directives in this section set up the values used by the main      server, which responds to any requests that arent handled by a      ltVirtualHostgt definition.  These values also provide defaults for      any ltVirtualHostgt containers you may define later in the file.           All of these directives may appear inside ltVirtualHostgt containers,      in which case these default settings will be overridden for the      virtual host being defined.                 ServerAdmin Your address, where problems with the server should be      emailed.  This address appears on some servergenerated pages, such      as error documents.  e.g. adminyourdomain.com          ServerAdmin postmasterlocalhost            ServerName gives the name and port that the server uses to identify itself.      This can often be determined automatically, but we recommend you specify      it explicitly to prevent problems during startup.           If your host doesnt have a registered DNS name, enter its IP address here.          ServerName localhost80            DocumentRoot The directory out of which you will serve your      documents. By default, all requests are taken from this directory, but      symbolic links and aliases may be used to point to other locations.          DocumentRoot Cxampphtdocs            Each directory to which Apache has access can be configured with respect      to which services and features are allowed andor disabled in that      directory and its subdirectories.            First, we configure the default to be a very restrictive set of       features.            ltDirectory gt         Options FollowSymLinks         AllowOverride None         Order deny,allow         Deny from all     ltDirectorygt        XAMPP We disable operating system specific optimizations for a listening       socket by the http protocol here. IE 64 bit make problems without this.       AcceptFilter http none            Note that from this point forward you must specifically allow      particular features to be enabled  so if somethings not working as      you might expect, make sure that you have specifically enabled it      below.                 This should be changed to whatever you set DocumentRoot to.          ltDirectory Cxampphtdocsgt                   Possible values for the Options directive are None, All,          or any combination of            Indexes Includes FollowSymLinks SymLinksifOwnerMatch ExecCGI MultiViews                   Note that MultiViews must be named explicitly  Options All          doesnt give it to you.                   The Options directive is both complicated and important.  Please see          httphttpd.apache.orgdocs2.2modcore.htmloptions          for more information.                  Options Indexes FollowSymLinks Includes ExecCGI                    AllowOverride controls what directives may be placed in .htaccess files.

If you do not specify an ErrorLog directive within a ltVirtualHostgt      container, error messages relating to that virtual host will be      logged here.  If you do define an error logfile for a ltVirtualHostgt      container, that hosts errors will be logged there and not here.          ErrorLog logserror.log      ScriptLog logscgi.log            LogLevel Control the number of messages logged to the errorlog.      Possible values include debug, info, notice, warn, error, crit,      alert, emerg.          LogLevel warn      ltIfModule logconfigmodulegt                   The following directives define some format nicknames for use with          a CustomLog directive see below.                  LogFormat h l u t r gts b Refereri UserAgenti combined         LogFormat h l u t r gts b common          ltIfModule logiomodulegt            You need to enable modlogio.c to use I and O           LogFormat h l u t r gts b Refereri UserAgenti I O combinedio         ltIfModulegt                    The location and format of the access logfile Common Logfile Format.          If you do not define any access logfiles within a ltVirtualHostgt          container, they will be logged here.  Contrariwise, if you do          define perltVirtualHostgt access logfiles, transactions will be          logged therein and not in this file.                  CustomLog logsaccess.log common                    If you prefer a logfile with access, agent, and referer information          Combined Logfile Format you can use the following directive.                  CustomLog logsaccess.log combined     ltIfModulegt      ltIfModule aliasmodulegt                   Redirect Allows you to tell clients about documents that used to           exist in your servers namespace, but do not anymore. The client           will make a new request for the document at its new location.          Example          Redirect permanent foo httplocalhostbar                    Alias Maps web paths into filesystem paths and is used to          access content that does not live under the DocumentRoot.          Example          Alias webpath fullfilesystempath                   If you include a trailing  on webpath then the server will          require it to be present in the URL.  You will also likely          need to provide a ltDirectorygt section to allow access to          the filesystem path.                    ScriptAlias This controls which directories contain server scripts.           ScriptAliases are essentially the same as Aliases, except that          documents in the target directory are treated as applications and          run by the server when requested rather than as documents sent to the          client.  The same rules about trailing  apply to ScriptAlias          directives as to Alias.                  ScriptAlias cgibin Cxamppcgibin      ltIfModulegt      ltIfModule cgidmodulegt                   ScriptSock On threaded servers, designate the path to the UNIX          socket used to communicate with the CGI daemon of modcgid.                  Scriptsock logscgi.sock     ltIfModulegt            Cxamppcgibin should be changed to whatever your ScriptAliased      CGI directory exists, if you have that configured.          ltDirectory Cxamppcgibingt         AllowOverride None         Options None         Order allow,deny         Allow from all     ltDirectorygt       ltIfModule mimemodulegt                   TypesConfig points to the file containing the list of mappings from          filename extension to MIMEtype.                  TypesConfig confmime.types                    AddType allows you to add to or override the MIME configuration          file specified in TypesConfig for specific file types.                  AddType applicationxgzip .tgz                   AddEncoding allows you to have certain browsers uncompress          information on the fly. Note Not all browsers support this.                  AddEncoding xcompress .Z         AddEncoding xgzip .gz .tgz                   If the AddEncoding directives above are commentedout, then you          probably should define those extensions to indicate media types                  AddType applicationxcompress .Z         AddType applicationxgzip .gz .tgz                    AddHandler allows you to map certain file extensions to handlers          actions unrelated to filetype. These can be either built into the server          or added with the Action directive see below                   To use CGI scripts outside of ScriptAliased directories          You will also need to add ExecCGI to the Options directive.                  AddHandler cgiscript .cgi .pl .asp           For type maps negotiated resources         AddHandler typemap var                    Filters allow you to process content before it is sent to the client.                   To parse .shtml files for serverside includes SSI          You will also need to add Includes to the Options directive.                  AddType texthtml .shtml         AddOutputFilter INCLUDES .shtml     ltIfModulegt      ltIfModule mimemagicmodulegt                   The modmimemagic module allows the server to use various hints from the          contents of the file itself to determine its type.  The MIMEMagicFile          directive tells the module where the hint definitions are located.

Negative 26084 pI have read my book and what my teacher has made slides on the subject of read and write methods using Exceptions like FileNotFoundException. I have written a good bit of the code and got it working to allow me to ask the user for a file path and to read this file and display it on the console. Im struggling as to reverse the file text and to output this new text to a file to savecreate. My book does not explain how to do both a read and write method on the same program. So the code I have written to do output is probably very wrong. I searched some on the internet for help but did not find anything that could help me since I want to allow the user to input what file locations they want to read and write to.p  pI am wanting   1. Create a class that allows the user to selecct a file name and output the contents of the file to the console. Recommend using a text file to display, java files are text files. You may want to put this code in a method to allow you to complete the remainder of this assignment without overwriting your code. a. Asking the user to enter the full path to your file to make certain you are processing the correct file. 2. Modify your codeadd a method to display the contents of the file in reverse order. You do not need to reverse the characters on each line but simply out put the lines of the file in reverse order. a. Read the content of the file into an ArrayList and then traverse the ArrayList. 3. Finally, copy the contents of the file to another file. You will need to loop through the file and write each line to a new file. I also want to create a new exception, FileMissingException which will extend FileNotFoundException. You will need to create a separate class to hold your new exception. Modify your code to catch the FileNotFoundException and throw a FileMissingException. In your main catch the FileMissingException and print the message.from the exception.p  pThe program is becoming a little bit disorganized because of all I have to accomplish.

Negative 26084 pI wonder what the best way is to connect the Datastore and the Search API.p  pWhat Im looking for is whenever I create some entity e.g. a product that this product will be added to a search index. On update the index should be updated as well, and when deleting the product  you guess right  the product should be removed from search index.p  pWhen searching for a product I want to do a fulltext search on the product index, but instead of the documents I need the real entities. Probably I will need to first search using the index, and then do a second call to the datastorep  pWhat worries me most is keeping the datastore and search index in synch. And of course also going through the search index and the datastore will not only be cumbersome but I feel it might also give pains in terms of pagination.p  pI wonder if some people already have connected the datastore and search api this way and what the results have been, and maybe some best practices available. The appengine docs are not telling much is this area.p

Negative 26084 pI feel so stupid... almost immediately after posting this i solved it... Somehow i managed to get the memory address as the value of the texture.

Otherwise, the CustomFormat is yyyMMdd hhmmss tt.p  pProblem  In the DropDown event I check for the minimum datetime.  If the .Value is equal to that then I update the .Value to be DateTime.Now.  When the dropdown calendar is shown the the calendar is set for 17530101, while the textbox .Value shows DateTime.Now.  p  pHow do I get the calendar to show the date that corresponds to the .Value property that was updated in the DropDown event  Even if there were a way to cancel the first DropDown event on of the DateTimePicker when the value is changed from DateTimePicker.MinimumDateTime to DateTime.Now I think that could work, because the 2nd time and subsequent times the dropdown calendar is displayed the calendar correctly matches the date displayed in the textbox DateTimePicker.Value.p  pHere is the code for the events that I have wired up to the DateTimePicker in question  p  precode    private void ValueDatetimePickerOnKeyUpObject sender, KeyEventArgs e              if e.KeyCode  Keys.Delete ampamp e.KeyCode  Keys.Back             return         var dp  DateTimePickersender         if dp  null             return         dp.Value  DateTimePicker.MinimumDateTime           private void ValueDatetimePickerDropDownObject sender, EventArgs e              var dp  DateTimePickersender         if dp  null             return         if dp.Value  DateTimePicker.MinimumDateTime             dp.Value  DateTime.Now           private void ValueDatetimePickerValueChangedObject sender, EventArgs e              var dp  DateTimePickersender         if dp  null             return         dp.CustomFormat  dp.Value  DateTimePicker.MinimumDateTime     yyyyMMdd hhmmss tt      codepre

Negative 26084 pI have a background which cycles through images, these images have no fixed sizes.p  pMy problem is that I cannot find a simple responsive frame for resizing images which are dedicated embackgroundem images. There are plenty of plugins for normal images on websites.p  ol liThe background of my website always has to have the image displayed.li licropping is allowed, is allowed the image must reposition itself in the center of the web browser.li lijQuery or Media is allowed, I dont really mind.li ol  pMy images and div look like thisp  precodeltdiv stylewidth100 height100 backgroundwhite positionabsolute marginleft0px margintop0pxgt     ltimg srcimage1.pnggt     ltimg srcimage2.pnggt     ltimg srcimage3.pnggt ltdivgt codepre  pA lot of the plugins out there set width to 100 and the height to auto. This will not work as if the browser width is, lets say, 200px and browser height 800px. The image will not cover the entire screen and keep its aspect ratio. There will be a gap under and above the image, so in this case, the height should be 100 and width changed to auto. And of course the other way around if the browser height is 200px and browser length is 800pxp  pExample of what I want a hrefhttpwww.martinlogin.se relnofollowhttpwww.martinlogin.seap

Negative 26084 pI basically have 4 days to get something at its basic level working meaning get a graph network object created in NHibernate.  Nothing perfect but just something that can be searched via an HNibernate Graph object model.p  pThat is, we have data fields which are gonna essentially be nodes in my object graph on a web form that when one fieldK for example is updated other fields FieldB, FieldT, etc.  are affected depend on that fieldK  and also need to be updated in a return as a result of updating fieldK.  This is just one example here, fieldK.p  pThis fieldK we updated could also be in other trees of fields what I think are Graphs in this case.  So if we update FieldA, we need to do a search to see in what other graphs FieldA is in and find it, then traverse its subnodes and update those subnode fields.p  pSo you essentially have a Network of Graphs type of structure.  p  pIve been asked to a store it in the DB ..in this case being SQL Server 2008 and b Create an NHibernate objects to represent the graph so we can work with it and search and traverse the nodes bidirectional up and down x trees and find FieldA and do what we neeed to in terms of updating its dependent fields for example.p  pSo my first thoughts arep  p1 Create a table that holds tree structures, for examplep  pTable DataFieldTreesp  precodeDataFieldTreeID     DataFieldID      ParentDataFieldID    Level                        0                 12                 NULL            0    Tree1         1                 232                 12             1        2                 32                  12             1        3                 100                 12             1        4                 210                 100            3        5                 500                 100            3        6                 600                 32             4        7                 800                 600            5        8                 44                 NULL            0     Tree2        9                 400                 44             1        10                55                  44             1        11                111                 55             2        12                211                 55             2        13                600                 111            3        14                43                  600            4        15                15                  600            5     ....more trees and so on codepre  pNotice that 600 and 100 nodes are found in both trees for example.p  pNow I figured ok, I need some way of tying those nodes that are found in multiple trees to their RootTreeIDs so I came up with this bridge tablep  pTable DataFieldRootDataFieldp  pRootFieldID are those fields in the first table that are the tree roots rows with NULL p  precodeDataFieldID   RootDataFieldID          100             0     100             8     600             0     600             8 codepre  pfigured this would allow me to quickly figure out which trees a certain node are in for lookup purposesp  pFinally to mend the graph and make it a graph I created a table to link the graphs trees together relate themp  pTable  DataFieldTreeRelationp  precodeRootDataFieldID    DataFieldTreeID    RelatedDataFieldTreeID                8                   800                 15           ... codepre  pso this would link the first tree to the second since node 800 in the first tree is connected to Node 15.p  pI know Im calling these trees when they are I think sets of graphs but I am new to all this and trying to articulate the requirement and my thinking when starting to think how I might do this.p  pThen theres the whole other issue of creating and parsing this into an NHibernate Network Graph object in C...and then I have to determine the best way to retrieve this stuff create linkedLists of nodes, who knows in C based on what I pull from these tables...no idea yet how Ill do this and form an object that we can search through p  pIm either way off, or have some decent thoughts about maybe how to go about it but not sure if Im even close to thinking right in terms of how people are dealing with this...p  pneed some help here andor guidance or reassurance that my ideas make sense.p

Negative 26084 pTo keep this question simple, consider a scenario where I am creating an Android Activity that simply reads data from an external source and uses that data within a TextView. I am seeing dramatic performance differences with the following two scenariosp  ol liReading the external data and populating the Activitys instance variables to use throughout the Activity. Results in execution time of 2220.479170 ms and the DalvikVM frees memory 12 times.li liReading the external data into local variables each time it needs to be used within class methods. Results in 1150.434916 ms and the DalvikVM frees memory 6 times.li ol  pAs you can see, using instance variables takes more than 1070 milliseconds longer to execute than using local variables and there are double the amount of memory leaks. The reason why I switched from using local to instance variables is because I was using the same data in different methods, therefore using an instance variable makes more sense than using multiple local variables.p  pMy question is why is the performance much more efficient when using local variables rather than instance variables and why does memory need to be freed double the amount of timesp  pA code snippetp  precodepublic class DataActivity extends Activity       Raw value table entries     Table 61     private int nbrchnsset1     private int nbrblksset1     private int nbrblkintsset1     private int maxinttimeset1     Table 62     private int blkendreadflag     private int blkendpulseflag        Table 63     private int lastblockelement     private int nbrvalidint     private int nbrvalidblocks     private int intervalorder     Table 64     ArrayListltStringgt table64Entries      Override     protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState          super.onCreatesavedInstanceState         setContentViewR.layout.activitylpdata          initializeVariables         classMethods                public void initializeVariables           Populate class variables from values in Table 61         TableReader tableReader  new TableReaderthis, R.raw.table61         ArrayListltStringgt table61Entries  tableReader.readTable         nbrchnsset1  table61Entries.get98         nbrblksset1  table61Entries.get90         nbrblkintsset1  table61Entries.get94         maxinttimeset1  table61Entries.get102         blkendreadflag  table61Entries.get22         blkendpulseflag  table61Entries.get26          Populate class variables from values in Table 63         tableReader  new TableReaderthis, R.raw.table63         ArrayListltStringgt table63Entries  tableReader.readTable         lastblockelement  table63Entries.get38         nbrvalidint  table63Entries.get5         nbrvalidblocks  table63Entries.get34         intervalorder  table63Entries.get22          Populate class variables from values in Table 64         tableReader  new TableReaderthis, R.raw.table64         table64Entries  tableReader.readTable            public void classMethods          ...      codepre

Negative 26084 pIs there any way to display an Android live wallpaper in a fragment I have a live wallpaper, and currently if the user wants to change some settings, they need to click settings, make a change, hit the back button, and see if the change is what they want. For certain wallpapers, the user doesnt exactly know what numbers they want, and usually they figure out the settings through experimentation, so the current method of going back and forth between the settings and the preview is a pain.p  pRight now a lot of the settings are in the form of a slider fragment that I wrote. I was wondering if it is possible to include a preview of the wallpaper in the fragment that will change live with the sliderp

Negative 26084 pBased on all of the documentation I have read on CORS support in IE9IE8, it seems quite clear thatp  ol liYou cannot initiate a CORS request in these browsers using codeXMLHttpRequestcode.  You must use IEs proprietary  codeXDomainRequestcode.li licodeXDomainRequestcode does not support preflighting.  My understanding of this limitation suggests that you can only send POST or GET CORS requests and these requests may only contain a hrefhttpwww.w3.orgTRcorssimpleheader relnofollowsimple headersa.  Furthermore, there are other very odd limitations Microsoft has put on XDR requests, but thats not entirely important here.li ol  pSo, what I have is a page at codehttp192.168.1.18080code.  Using codeXMLHttpRequestcode, I was attempting to send a DELETE request to codehttp192.168.1.1.9000code.  I fully expected this to fail.  I was just doing a sanity check before I rethought the associated request to ensure that it would work for CORS requests once I switch to use of XDR.  Again, I am using IE8 here.p  precodevar xhr  new XMLHttpRequest xhr.openDELETE, http192.168.1.19000, true xhr.send codepre  pOddly enough, the request seemed to succeed.

Negative 26084 pI am trying to adapt a piece of middleware I wrote for a home project. The goal of the middleware was to append a comment block to the top of an HTML or XML or other user defined template types that displayed information about that template, such as the view that called it, the template location and so on. It was fantastically useful for debugging, especially when working on a project you are not familiar on as it allows you to quickly identify templates and their locations.p  pThe issue is, in order to get the template name it relies on the use of SimpleTemplateResponse in the view, as that holds the template name, so it can be picked up in the middleware in processtemplateresponse.p  pThis is obviously makes the middleware wildly impractical for porting into existing projects because normally rendertoresponse is used, and that returns an HttpResponse object which longer knows what template was used to render it.p  pThe person that wrote the first instance of a template identifier from which I adapted my version that I came across on a project I used to work on, used threading.currentThread or similar and found the template name that way and passed it to the middleware, but I no longer have access to that code so I cannot check how it was done.p  pDoes anyone know of a way to access the template name that doesnt involve using SimpleTemplateResponse, or ideally patching rendertoresponse though I will accept that if it seems to be the only wayp  pThe middlewarep  precode Base template for the htmlurl locator comment block COMMENTBLOCK   lt [ url      ] gtgt httphostspaths [ referer  ] gtgt referers [ module   ] gtgt modules [ function ] gtgt functions, line lines [ args     ] gtgt argsargss, kwargskwargss, defaultsdefaultss [ template ] gtgt templates gt     Add any additional template types you wish to add the comment block to.

Negative 26084 pI am implementing an edit feature for 3 related models..p  pand to divide the work .. i implemented 3 tabs using bootstrap extensions...now each tab contains textfields, drop downs, etc., now the contents of the text and the dropdowns, radio buttons etc are preloaded for the user since this is an edit feature, it would be convenient for them if their choices were retained, and that they only need to change specific fields that they want to change without really having to redo the entire form.p  pEach form in a tab has its own independent Save button that saves the model and then switches to the next tab after refresh.p  pHeres what im trying to do, and quite having a hard time .. Im sure everybody has a facebook account here.. remember when you try to write a status update, or when you are chatting with somebody and then you click a button that redirects to another pagep  pThen a dialog box or modal will alert you that you havent finished your post yet, and that it gives you an option whether to leave or to stay in the pagep  pSimilar to what im trying to do im trying to alert the user if heshe wants to save or discard his changes if there are changes made before he switches to another tab.. I really have no idea how to do this..p  pon how the widget works..is abstracted or i havent found it yet atleast, and unlike in java where i can easily search for Events onChange or something..im new to php and yii.. any idea ,on how to do it, what to use, or a sample code will be really helpful guys..

The the whole thing gently scrolls down into position. Its as if the tableview becomes fullsize but is of course offscreen then it animates down to fit the view in the correct place. p  pI hope I have described that sufficiently.  Its not easy to describe animations but under springs and struts, I can smoothly animate the table back to original size AND position. Done at normal animation speeds, this problem causes a flicker which is just acceptable but I would rather fix this issue if anyone can help Im pulling my hair outp  pThanksp

We are using REST for the interaction between modules when they are on different servers. Now we need to process streaming data between modules. One module sends a request  another module asynchronously sends back chunks of data objects. We have tried to use KryoNet and Apache Mina.

Negative 26084 pWeve got an API running on Nginx, supposed to return JSON objects. This server has a lot of load so we did a lot of performance improvements. p  pThe API recieves an ID from the client. The server has a bunch of files representing these IDs. So if the ID is found as a file, the contents of that file Which is JSON will be returned by the backend. If the file does not exists, no backend is called, Nginx simple sends a 404 for that, so we save performance No backend system has to run.p  pNow we stumbled upon a problem. Due to old systems we still have to support, we cannot hand out a 404 page for clients as this will cause problems. What I came up with, is to return an empty JSON string instead codecode with a fake 200 status code. This needs to be a highly performant solution to still be able to handle all the load.p  pIs this possible to do, and if so, howp

Negative 26084 pIn Java SE from Oracle, it is required for a provider of cryptographic functions to be signed. This signing needs to occur using a private key belonging to a certificate that has been signed by Oracle. If the code.jarcode of the provider is not signed, then the provider cannot be plugged into the Java Cryptography Architecture JCA as a Java Cryptography Extension JCE.p  pDoes Android 4.04.4 require the providers to be signed as well If so, are there specific regulations to creating a keycertificate pair that is used for signingp

Negative 26084 pNearing completion, InstallShield 2010 running under Vista is failing with the following messagep  pISDEV  error 7132 An error occurred streaming ISSetup.dll support file ..Release..Setup.inxp  pwhere Release is the directory from which InstallShield was launched.  This error is fatal. The InstallShield build aborts, and no installer is created.p  pInsofar as watching Windows Explorer would reveal, I see no evidence of the Setup.inx file being created.  I suspected some kind of Windows file protection problem, but  peculiarly, the larger tree in which this problem occurs has uniform protections, and I  can make other installers within other parts of the tree without any difficulty.  The other installers have been created with more or less the same methodology and deal with similar directory configurations.p  pI would appreciate any thoughts on what might be the nature of this problem, both in general and with regard to any specific theories.  Ive read elsewhere that error 7132 captures a sort of grab bag of possible errors.p  pThanks, all.p

Negative 26084 pI am writing an IOS app. It involves a lot of data downloading which involves images and text in JSON format. I am using NSOperation Queue to make the download process sequential. The entire app works fine in iPhone4 and iPhone4s but in iPhone 5 the app crashes while inserting data in to the database. I have an API call which returns about 350 items back. WHile inserting these records to database the app crashes.p  pI am not getting any crash logs while debugging. The app simply quits. But from device logs within the Organizer it shows Memory warning. strongMyAppstrong is the name of my application.p  precodeDec  3 171421 GavsiPhone MyApp[6673] ltWarninggt Inserted Reward  Dec  3 171421 GavsiPhone MobileMail[6648] ltWarninggt Received memory warning.

I developed the prototype for this app on my Mac using Sublime Text and it works perfectly, all Im trying to do is integrate it into the WebForms project. p  pWhat we did is, creat a new master page called TST.master the name of the new feature inside TST.master is all the webforms code for the header and the footer. in the codeltheadgtcode tag is where all the Angular scripts library scripts live. p  pInside the project there is a TST folder with a index.asp file that references the TST.master page. In the index.asp file is a div with an ngapp. Then nested inside that is an empty div with an ngview. p  pAt the bottom of the index.aspx is all the app.js, controllers.js, services.js etc tags. p  pWith the navigation being done in webforms, header buttons for my section point to index.asp with  after for the routing. so index.aspxsection1 index.aspxsection2 etc etc. p  pWhen I load up the main web forms app it loads fine. But when I navigate to the angular section of the app the browser locks up. I cant load up the console because the browser is frozen. p  pHowever if I comment out the ngview or the script tag with angular.js it freezes up. I have no idea whats happening. p  pAny help is greatly appreciated. p

Negative 26084 pI am using GCC version 4.2.4. The issue explained below cant be reproduced on Gcc 4.6.x and these are the only two versions I tested. p  pI have an header file that defines enumerations, Header abc.hp  precodeenum test      VALUE1  1,     VALUE2  2,      VALUEMAX  0xFFFF,  codepre  pThis header is included in a few source files and each source file creates an object .o at compilation time. And there are few source file that dont reference to any of the enumerations in abc.h. p  pThe issue I am seeing is that if I add a new constant VALUE3 in abc.h, then the binary md5sum of the objects that dont use any enumerations also gets changes. This only happen when i apply optimizaions and not otherwise at compilation. p  pI suspect that it has something to do with flags ftreevrp and ftreedominatoropts that gets enabled with optimizations. using these flags with fno still cause some of the objects to change but prevents other few from changing that gets changes with these flags. p  pAnother interesting obsevation is that the md5sum comes out to be same for even or odd number of enumerations. p  pCan anyone please help me understand that whats going on in the back end and is there any way to avoid binary change to maintain md5sum when there is no actual code change for that specific object. p  pThanks in advance. p  pEdited p  pFor one object, following is the diff. For other objects there are few other changes as well in mov etc instructions . As you can see only the operand registers in some instructions are swapped.

Negative 26084 pI am using the a hrefhttpsgithub.comPrinzhornskrollr relnofollowskrollra framework to animate different parts of a web page I am building.p  pSo far it is working awesome. I highly recommend that framework. I am now investigating the feasibility of making satellite images orbit a globe icon as I scroll. My initial plan was to achieve this effect by animating the top, left, zindex, scale, and opacity attributes of the satellite images as they move around the globe. This is working well.p  pThe difficult part now is the path. How do I calculate the correct positions for each object to follow an elliptical path around the globe Doing it by guessing was very slow and frustrating and turned out badly. p  pIs there an equation I should be using for this Is there a better way than animating the top and left attributes of the image Any thoughts or ideas would be very helpful.p

Negative 26084 pI am using Eclipse Kepler with JBoss 7.1.1 and I use JBoss Tools Central to generate the Java EE Web Project template project.  The project generates successfully and runs fine.  However, after starting the server, when I click on the project and select Run as JUnit Test I have a couple of problemsissuesp  p1 The console shows deployed test.war .  But neither the console nor the Kepler JUnit View show any test information at all.  As a test, I altered the following line in the autogenerated code for MemberRegistrationTest.java assertNotNullnewMember.getId to be assertNullnewMember.getIdp  pto force an assert.  However, I get no output in the console nor in the JUnit view showing this assert.  As far as I can tell, the Run as JUnit Test is either not running at all or it is failing to display any results.p  p2 Each time I Run as Junit Test I get one or more folders added to standalonedatacontent, each of which is named with a two digit hex character e.g., 87 and that folder contains another folder with a 38 hex character name e.g. ed8525e1a637334f002e6c4ebec047445b0ec3.  In that folder is a file named content that is about 750k in size.  Every time I run a test I get more of these folders and they are never cleaned up.  Further, in The JBoss config file standalone.xml I discovered that the following has been addedp  precodeltdeploymentsgt     ltdeployment nametest.war runtimenametest.wargt         ltcontent sha187ed8525e1a637334f002e6c4ebec047445b0ec3gt     ltdeploymentgt ltdeploymentsgt codepre  pwhere the 87ed8525e1a637334f002e6c4ebec047445b0ec3 corresponds to the folder 87 and the subfolder ed8525e1a637334f002e6c4ebec047445b0ec3 for example.  It appears that the 40 char SHA1 hash is used to name these two folders.  If I delete the project and ask for it to be removed from disk I get an error stating that An exception has been caught while processing the refactoring Delete Resource and Details shows that it could not delete the Project folder.  Then, when I restart Kepler and try to recreate the Project with the same name I get the error that it already exists.  If I then shutdown Kelper I get an error that the project cannot be updated.  Also, the  block stays in standalone.xml.p  pCan someone explain why this unaltered project right out of the box is failing to test and is messing up Keplers Project management when I try to delete itp  pThank you.

Negative 26084 pThis seems like a very simple task but I find it extremely hard to accomplish in Moq.  I have a repository that calls a unit of work to query a random picture from a database.  This query has one constraint the random picture from the database cannot be equal to the current picture being displayed.  Im building an NUnit test for the repository and Id like to mock the unit of work like sop  precode[TestFixture] public class WhenthenextrandompictureforTopSlidePictureshowhasbeenrequested      private Guid currentPictureID     private Picture randomPicture     private MockltIUnitOfWorkltGuidgtgt unitOfWorkMock      [SetUp]     public void Context              currentPictureID  Guid.NewGuid         randomPicture  new Picture  ID  Guid.NewGuid          unitOfWorkMock  new MockltIUnitOfWorkltGuidgtgt         TODO  Find out how to setup and verify expression when mocking method with equality comparison in a lambda expression.         unitOfWorkMock.Setupuow gt uow.GetRandomltPicturegtpic gt pic.ID  currentPictureID             .ReturnsrandomPicture           [Test]     public void ThePictureRepositorycanquerynextrandompicture              Arrange         var picRepo  new PictureRepositoryunitOfWorkMock.Object          Act         var randomPicture  picRepo.GetNextRandomPicturecurrentPictureID          Assert         unitOfWorkMock.Verifyuow gt              uow.GetRandomltPicturegtpic gt pic.ID  currentPictureID             , Times.Once          Assert.AreEqualrandomPicture, randomPicture       codepre  pIn the code above, the codeGetRandomltPicturegtExpressionltFuncltPicture, boolgtgtcode in the UnitOfWork is supposed to return any picture in the database whos Guid ID isnt equal to the current pics ID.  However, Setup method called from unitOfWorkMock returns null regardless of randomPictures value.

Negative 26084 pI am in the process of building a packaged chrome application and was wanting to use Angular. Being a local application that has ui behaviors similar to a native application, I wanted to make use of multiple windows for popups and different workflows. This would be more intuitive to the user as opposed to dialog boxes or modals. p  pIs there a good angular way of sharing service instances amongst these windows Is there a different solution that I am not seeingp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pTo be a little more clear, I am wanting to share data between javascript windows. There is the basic codewindow.postMessagecode but I would like to be able to share service instances between these two separate windows. p  pstrongPossible Solutionstrong p  pI have found a hack to share services and posted an answer below. Id love thoughts on it. What might be more ideal is if I could share the codeinjectorcode service itself. That would probably take care of all possible options and make it as if it were in the same app. I believe the codeinjectorcode has reference to the rootElement in the DOM which would of course be different in the new window so that solution may not work.

Negative 26084 pI am using the impressive GPUImage framework for iOS in order to filter the incoming stream of the camera, and save it afterwards. When it is done, I want to close the containing view, and open another that has the playback option, for viewing the movie you just shot. Thing is, when I do nothing fancy, I can finish the recording, save the file to the temp file, and copy that to the camera roll synchronically. But when I use input sound and filters, the GPUImageMovieWriter seems to slow down too much, and produces empty frames to the beginning or ending of the video. p  pTo set up the filters and stuff, and make the preview of the live filtered image I do this p  precodevideoCamera[[GPUImageVideoCamera alloc] initWithSessionPresetAVCaptureSessionPresetiFrame960x540 cameraPositionAVCaptureDevicePositionBack] movieWriter  [[GPUImageMovieWriter alloc] initWithMovieURLoutputURL sizeCGSizeMakeself.view.frame.size.width, self.view.frame.size.height] movieWriter.encodingLiveVideo  YES movieWriter.shouldPassthroughAudio  YES videoCamera.audioEncodingTarget  movieWriter  filteredVideoView  [[GPUImageView alloc]initWithFrameCGRectMake0.0, 0.0, self.view.frame.size.width, self.view.frame.size.height] [self.view addSubviewfilteredVideoView]  blendFilter  [[GPUImageNormalBlendFilter alloc]init] sourcePicture  [[GPUImagePicture alloc] initWithCGImage[mc getImage]] [sourcePicture processImage]  [blendFilter addTargetfilteredVideoView] [videoCamera blendFilter] [videoCamera startCameraCapture] codepre  pwhere all variables like outputURL and mc are all properly set.

Negative 26084 pThere are a lot of questions and documentation about converting HTML entities and special characters to UTF8 text in PHP. And also there is the PHP documentation itself, such as this a hrefhttpphp.netmanualenfunction.htmlspecialcharsdecode.php relnofollowcodehtmlspecialcharsdecodecodea and this a hrefhttpphp.netmanualenfunction.htmlentitydecode.php relnofollowcodehtmlentitydecodecodea. However, I could not find any functionsolution that clearly describes how to convert any HTML charachters and special entities to UTF8 text. All of them state something like if you want to do this, then do that, etc. But no solution ever states strongto have pure UTF8 text that could be read by humans, then do thisstrong. p  pThe reason for me asking, is I really cannot have a test case. I am reading off a database, and it is multylingual. However the only guarantee is that the characters are in HTML, and I need to convert those to UTF8, in a way that can be read by humans who understand those languages. Now, how can I do that What is the proper way to sanitizedecode the input so it is pure textp  pThanks.p  hr  h2Updateh2  pHere is an update, as it is clear from the comments I was not asking the question properly. My DB contains text. I would like to convert that text which contains HTML entities and special characters, to UTF8 text that I can display to the end user on the webpage. This text in the databae is written in multiple languages such as French, Arabic, English ...etc.. All those can contains HTML entities for special characters. So how can I convert all that to UTF8 text that can be read by humans who understand those languages I like to remove those special characters and convert them to something that can be read by humans.p

Negative 26084 pIm currently using the Nape physics engine for a Peggle style game in ActionScript 3.0.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comJHlJZ.jpg altenter image description herep  pIt is very easy to use, and runs smoothly. However, The only difficulty Im running into with Nape is replaying the exact same simulation.p  pEven if I supply it the same timestep value throughout the entire gameplay, it seems to have enough error in the calculations that the ball hits different pegs every once in a while starting the round from scratch, sometimes even resulting more or less lit pegs.p  pSo my question isp  pstrongIs there any other physics engines for Flash that can reproduce a given simulation EXACTLY the same each time it is relaunchedstrongp  pEDIT The idea of recording the data on everyframes and playing it back was tossed around other forums Ive asked this question. But unfortunately, the replay feature is not so much for the same user to view hisher own balldrop scenario. It would be used for sharing between players on different machines ex client reports a bug with ball drop seeded a value 1234, we punch in 1234 and should be able to see the same issue. So if we prerecord a bunch of scenarios and by that, I mean ENOUGH to give the player the illusion they are actually running a physics simulation, randomly pick one, and use that random ID as our way to identify a particular scenario, that means well need to embed tons of data in the game  that could be otherwise saved if the physics engine was deterministic.p  hr  pAnd just to checkoff anything Ive already tried in Napep  ul liThe ball is reset to the same position amp rotation at the beginning of the game.li liThe balls initial velocity is set on user click, therefore this should override any velocity that carriedover from the last round.li liThe pegs dont move they are static, so no point of resetting those.li liThe part that catches the ball consists of only static boxes and sensors, so no point in resetting those either.li ul

Negative 26084 pI am trying to replace a regular image with retina display image 2x using retina.js javascript library. But problem is that the original image is not getting replaced with the retina image. In fact there is no image in high resolution devices and the div containing codeltimggtcode is blank. However when i checked through firebug then src was retina image. But i dont know why it is not loaded on the page. One important thing i want to tell you that this regular image is not loaded by default on page loading. In fact the container of image i.e. parent div is codedisplaynonecode at start and appears only after certain condition becomes true using jQuery code. Then it becomes codedisplayblockcode and image appears. I think this could be the reason why retina.js doesnt load the dynamic image.

Negative 26084 pWhen rendering a chart with JFreeChart, I noticed a layout problem when the charts category labels included Japanese characters. Although the text is rendered with the correct glyphs, the text was positioned in the wrong location, presumably because the font metrics were wrong.p  pThe chart was originally configured to use the a hrefhttpff.static.1001fonts.netsosourcesanspro.regular.ttf relnofollowSource Sans Pro Regulara font for that text, which supports only Latin character sets. The obvious solution is to bundle an actual Japanese .TTF font and ask JFreeChart to use it. This works fine, in that the output text uses the correct glyphs and it is also laid out correctly.p  h2My questionsh2  ul lipHow did java.awt end up rendering the Japanese characters correctly in the first scenario, when using a source font that doesnt actually support anything except Latin characters If it matters, I am testing on OS X 10.9 with JDK 1.7u45.pli lipIs there any way to render the Japanese characters without bundling a separate Japanese font This is my end goal Although the bundling solution works, I dont want to add 6 Mb of bloat to my application if it can be avoided. Java clearly knows how to render the Japanese glyphs somehow even without the font at least in my local environmentits seemingly just the metrics that are busted. I am wondering if this is related to the frankenfont issue below.pli lipAfter the JRE performs an internal transformation, why does the Source Sans Pro font tell the caller via a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase7docsapijavaawtFont.htmlcanDisplayUpTojava.lang.String relnofollowcanDisplayUpToa that it can display Japanese characters even though it cannot See below.pli ul  h2Edited to clarifyh2  ul lipThis is a server app, and the text we are rendering will show up in the clients browser andor in PDF exports. The charts are always rasterized to PNGs on the server.pli lipI have no control over the server OS or environment, and as nice as it would be to use the Javastandard platform fonts, many platforms have poor font choices that are unacceptable in my use case, so I need to bundle my own at least for the Latin fonts. Using a platform font for the Japanese text is acceptable.pli lipThe app can potentially be asked to display a mix of Japanese and Latin text, without no a priori knowledge of the text type. I am ambivalent about what fonts get used if a string contains mixed languages, so long as the glyphs are rendered correctly.pli ul  h2Detailsh2  pI understand that java.awt.FontTextLayout is smart, and that when trying to lay out text, it first asks the underlying fonts whether they can actually render the supplied characters. If not, it presumably swaps in a different font that knows how to render those characters, but this is not happening here, based on my debugging pretty far into the JRE classes. codeTextLayoutsingleFontcode always returns a nonnull value for the font and it proceeds through the codefastInitcode part of the constructor.p  pOne very curious note is that the Source Sans Pro font somehow gets coerced into telling the caller that it emdoesem know how to render Japanese characters after the JRE performs a transformation on the font.p  pFor examplep  precode We load our font here download from the first link above in the question  File fontFile  new Filetmpsourcesanspro.regular.ttf Font font  Font.createFontFont.TRUETYPEFONT, new FileInputStreamfontFile GraphicsEnvironment.getLocalGraphicsEnvironment.registerFontfont   Here is some Japanese text that we want to display String str     Should say that the font cannot display any of these characters return code  0  System.out.printlnFont   font.getName   can display up to   font.canDisplayUpTostr   But after doing this magic manipulation, the font claims that it can display the  entire string return code  1  AttributedString as  new AttributedStringstr, font.getAttributes MapltAttributedCharacterIterator.Attribute,Objectgt attributes  as.getIterator.getAttributes Font newFont  Font.getFontattributes   Eeek, 1     System.out.printlnFont   newFont.getName   can display up to   newFont.canDisplayUpTostr codepre  pThe output of this isp  precodeFont Source Sans Pro can display up to 0 Font Source Sans Pro can display up to 1 codepre  pNote that the three lines of magic manipulation mentioned above are not something of my own doing we pass in the true source font object to JFreeChart, but it gets munged by the JRE when drawing the glyphs, which is what the three lines of magic manipulation code above replicates. The manipulation shown above is the functional equivalent of what happens in the following sequence of callsp  ol liorg.jfree.text.TextUtilitiesdrawRotatedStringli lisun.java2d.SunGraphics2DdrawStringli lijava.awt.font.TextLayoutconstructorli lijava.awt.font.TextLayoutsingleFontli ol  pWhen we call Font.getFont in the last line of the magic manipulation, we still get a Source Sans Pro font back, but the underlying fonts codefont2Dcode field is different than the original font, and this single font now claims that it knows how to render the entire string. Why It appears that Java is giving us back some sort of frankenfont that knows how to render all kinds of glyphs, even though it only understands the metrics for the glyphs that are supplied in the underlying source font.p  pA more complete example showing the JFreeChart rendering example is here, based off one of the JFreeChart examples a hrefhttpsgist.github.comsdudleyb710fd384e495e7f1439 relnofollowhttpsgist.github.comsdudleyb710fd384e495e7f1439a The output from this example is shown below.p  h2Example with the Source Sans Pro font laid out incorrectlyh2  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comADwQ4.png altenter image description herep  h2Example with the IPA Japanese font laid out correctlyh2  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comry0XX.png altenter image description herep

I wish to create horizontal bar charts, and this tutorial is helpful a hrefhttpwww.jqueryflottutorial.comhowtomakejqueryflothorizontalbarchart.html relnofollowhttpwww.jqueryflottutorial.comhowtomakejqueryflothorizontalbarchart.htmlap  pThe following 3 lines of code pass in the data that the chart plugin uses to create the chartp  precodevar rawData  [[1582.3, 0], [28.95, 1], [1603, 2], [774, 3], [1245, 4], [85, 5], [1025, 6]] var dataSet  [ label Precious Metal Price, data rawData, color E8E800 ] var ticks  [[0, Gold], [1, Silver], [2, Platinum], [3, Palldium], [4, Rhodium], [5, Ruthenium], [6, Iridium]] codepre  pMy charts however, can not use hard coded values like this above, and instead the data passed into my chart needs to be dynamic. I can pass data into the coderowDatacode variable using an Ajax call in my MVC Razor View which calls a Controller Action which returns Json see below.p  precode.ajax             type GET,             contentType applicationjson charsetutf8,             dataType json,             url StatisticsGetTestData,             error function                   alertAn error occurred.             ,             success function data               var rawData  [data]                codepre  pMy problem is how can I also pass the data from my Controller Action into the codetickscode variable p  pI suppose what I need to know is, can I return from my Controller Action two sets of data, one for the coderawDatacode variable in the format of p  precode[[1582.3, 0], [28.95, 1], [1603, 2], [774, 3], [1245, 4], [85, 5], [1025, 6]] codepre  pand, secondly for the codetickscode variable in the format ofp  precode[[0, Gold], [1, Silver], [2, Platinum], [3, Palldium], [4, Rhodium], [5, Ruthenium], [6, Iridium]] codepre  pHopefully this makes sense. p  pAny feedback or advice would be greatly appreciated.p  pThanks.p

Negative 26084 pIm really having a hard time devising an algorithm to solve the following problem p  pI will be accepting an array of inputs like below p  precodeinput  array100, 101, 102, 110, 111, 112 codepre  pand the output should be a string containing p  precode100102, 110112. codepre  pBasically what I need to do is to stronggroup numbers in sequence,strong like strong100 to 102strong and form them in a string strong100102strong since all numbers form a sequence. But since the value strong110 is not next to 102strong, values strong110 to 112 should be grouped and the string 110112 will be formed.strongp  pInput is strongnot limited to numbers however,strong they are strings. So I will be expecting inputs like p  precodeinput  arrayN1, N2, N3, GX1, GX2, Z3 codepre  pFollowing the same pattern, the output should bep  precodeN1N3, GX1GX3, Z3 codepre  pMy pseudocode im a newbie to attack the problem for the numbers atleast isp  precodesequenceArr  [] string   foreach...     ifnextValue  prevValue1       sequenceArr[]  nextValue    else       form the string from the sequenceArr       if the preceeding string doesnt conform to the pattern anymore.      codepre  pThe problem I think I will be facing above is if the inputs are not sorted.. I could sort them, but how about for strings with character values in them Im kinda lost, and I dont think Im going anywhere with this solution. p  pstrongUPDATED FURTHER DESCRIPTION strongp  pThis will just be a simple grouping algorithm, only the last number will indicate grouping,p  pAB1DF AB2DF and AB3DF will strongNOTstrong be grouped to AB1DF  AB3DF. That simplifies the problem, also the 0 prefix doesnt matter, 001 and 002 can be grouped as 12.p  pThe simple rule is basically this p  precodecharacter  number   ABC            1  codepre  pA difference in character means an entirely different thing.p

Here is an example of one .slider that may be added to a page using ASP.net, with controls dynamically generated within a repeater.  It uses hidden fields to initialize the slider based on the type of value being manipulated.  Also, it updates labels and other values also dynamically generated on the page inside the slide event.p  pThe current answer shows how to configure multiple sliders, but uses only one slider declaration.  Im really looking for an answer that does the same thing but strongallows for each slider to be independently configuredstrong.  If this can still be accomplished with one slider call then that will work too, although Im not sure if this can be done.  p  precodevar currentSlider  ltpanSlider.ClientIDgt.slider         range min,         max parseIntlthfMaxValue.ClientIDgt.val,         value parseIntlthfInitValue.ClientIDgt.val,         step parseIntlthfStepValue.ClientIDgt.val,         slide function event, ui             set the text to show the current value and update the hidden field for postback           ltlabValue.ClientIDgt.textui.value           lthfValue.ClientIDgt.valui.value            determine the difference from base to current value           var difference  ui.value  lthfBaseValue.ClientIDgt.val           ltlabDifference.ClientIDgt.textdifference             add tooltip to handle            handle.qtipoption, content.text,   ui.value                 codepre

Negative 26084 pI have an Excel file with various market indexes, dates, and values. In this file there is a single column to the left representing the market index names followed by many date columns to the right. I can perform this pivot in Excel, SSIS or SQL Server. I have the most recent versions of each program. I dont want to simply copy and paste special transpose in Excel. I would like the solution to be automated as possible. I suspect loading this data into SSMS and using SQL would be the easiest.

However, had many errors and was not easy to debug.p  pNow I am trying a Tornado approach but AFAIK please correct me if Im wrong integrating async with a regular django app wrapped by WSGIContainer websockets would go through Tornado, regular connections through Django will be a true server killer if a resource is heavy or, somehow, the Django ORM goes slow into heavy operations.p  pI was thinking on moving to TwistedCyclone. Before I move from one architecture with such issue to ANOTHER architecture with such issue, id like to askp  pstrongDoes Tornado andor Twisted have an architecture of scheduling tasks in the same way Gevent doesstrong this means when certain greenlets block, they schedule themselves to other threads, at least until the operation finishes. Im asking this because please correct me if Im wrong a regular django view will not be suitable for stuff like codeinlineCallbackscode, and will cause the whole server to be blocked incl. the websockets.p  pIm new to async programming in python, so theres a huge change I have misinformation about more than one concept. Please help me clarifying this before I switch.p

Negative 26084 pIm trying to think of the best way to import csv data into rethinkdb while avoiding possible duplicates eg importing the same file twice. p  pThe csv data comes from bank statements. There is no real primary key, instead a composite key of date,description and amount can be used. p  pI wanted to use the CLI for imports but I couldnt see how I could do that given I dont have a single primary key. p  pIs the best way to iterate through the csv, first check for the existence and then insert if not found I struggled to create a single query that would insert only if the check for existence was empty. p  pAny guidance  I was assuming this is a somewhat common scenario p  pIm using JavaScript as my language p  pThanks in advancep

It does a center between left and right of the document.p  pElements that are in the left of the page are not shown because are behind the menu. How can I indicate that the menu existsp
Negative 26084 pI tried tesseract with some standard text images. Its great. Now can I teach tesseract to understand the format of a document I mean lets take a wedding invitation of an invitation card. There could be a square box in which the time and place might have been written. If say there are only three formats possible for all wedding invitations I want to process can I teach tesseract to somehow see this Or should I somehow extend the code to do that myselfp

Negative 26084 pIm attempting to update a users secondary information addresses, emails, externalIds, ims, phones, organizations, relationships  the things listed on the a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comadminsdkdirectoryv1referenceuserspatch relnofollowpatcha page that are arrays and such. Im successfully able to authenticate, add new information one or more at a time and remove one as long as it leaves one remaining I update the JArray leaving everything but the one I want.p  pSo, if I have 3 addresses I can remove one or two and it updates appropriately. I can easily use a patch to clear and update normal information like the first and last name, rename users and update passwords.p  pHowever, if I try to remove ALL of one type of information, nothing happens. I have tried setting the user address property to null as well as an empty List or Array. Through debugging I have verified the user patch its sending out is accurate, but nothing seems to happen serverside.p  pI tried using a full Update, as well and again using null or empty lists, but the same issue happens.p  pWhat do I need to do to fully clean out one of these propertiesp  pExample codep  precodeTry both a full user for an update and a blank user for a patch User uRetrieved  directoryServiceDict[Domain].Users.GetfullEmail.Execute User uPatch  new User uPatch.Addresses  null uRetrieved.Addresses  new ListltAddressgt try both a patch and update directoryServiceDict[Domain].Users.PatchuPatch, u.PrimaryEmail.Execute directoryServiceDict[Domain].Users.UpdateuRetrieved, u.PrimaryEmail.Execute codepre  pstrongUpdatestrong I ran a series of tests, trying to pass anything I could but nothing had worked. After digging in the API source code I found that I could call the services Serializer method to see what its piping out, and I found that assigning it an empty string, and empty list, a list with one empty string, a new Address for example object and a list with an new Address object all didnt work. The serializer threw them as expected, however.p  pIf I set it to null, though, it was ignored.p  pUpon reviewing the a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comadminsdkdirectoryv1guidesperformancepatch relnofollowpatch semanticsa page I see the followingp  blockquote   pTo delete a field, specify the field and set it to null. For example, comment null. You can also delete an entire object if it is mutable by setting it to null.p blockquote  pLooking at the given examples, they want the data to show up like codeaddressesnullcode and not like any of the other variations such as codeaddressescode, codeaddresses[]code or codeaddresses[]code.p  pAfter spending some time digging in to the API code I was able to find a hrefhttpscode.google.compgoogleapidotnetclientsourcebrowseSrcGoogleApis.CoreApisJsonNewtonsoftJsonSerializer.csr6e15a96917b603dcf4fecbf5534ef5177fcc3d24 relnofollowline 42 of the Serializer they usea in which they set the serializer settings to ignore null I assume to help keep data amounts lower for patching, for example.p  pThis works for most things, but means when trying to Patch or Update, the serializer is ignoring the values set as null and therefore the server is not seeing that entry and wont delete it.p  pSo, Im working on trying to figure out the best way to fix this. There are some a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions22596472jsonnetpartialupdaterestapiclientother postsa here on StackOverflow Im going to look at, and hopefully Ill be able to work it out unless someone gets to it first. If I do, Ill post an answer.p  pstrongUpdate 2strong I was able to get the code to print out a serialized string including the Null by creating a new Customizer for the String type. Each time the code is run it generates a customized NullToken basically a generated GUID that I tacked a word on to that is set as the string value of the field I want to delete. Then when the serializer hits a string, it checks to see if the string matches the NullToken or not. If it does, I use a jsonWriter method of codeWriteNullcode. Otherwise, I just pass it to the general codeWriteValuecode.p  pI then just had to customize a series of classes the Initializer that gets passed to the Service, the NewtonsoftJsonSerializer that is part of the Initializer and the Customizer that is added to the NJS settings and set those up to be used instead of the defaults when creating the service.p  pNow my code properly pumps out something like codeaddressesnullcode and I am happy about that.p  pUnfortunately it still doesnt work. I did some more testing in the API explorer and realized even though the returned object shows an update of what you put in, nothing actually is happening. I dont think its deleting at all and therefore I have a hrefhttpscode.google.comagoogle.compappsapiissuesissuesdetailid3701 relnofollowopened an issue for the API itselfa. If it turns out to be my own fault, Ill throw an answer here.p  pstrongSummarystrong Im now fairly certain the issue is in the Google API itself.p
Negative 26084 pI have scenario where I have to display a list of questions to the user. I came across observable array and foreach binding in knockout. I could easily display a list of questions with them.p  pHowever, my requirement is the questions are interdependent. say for eg. if the first question has a response of a, then question 2 must be displayed, if question 2 has a response of b then question 4,5 should be displayed. How can I do this with knockout jsp  pI am thinking about using computed field for each question and defining a visible condition based on them. But I am not able to think of a complete solution. Any suggestions would be extremely helpful. Thanks in advancep
Negative 26084 pI have a .jar file which represents a wrapper to launch another .jar file with some arguments for the JVM, as apparently there is no other way to do it. This wrapper builds up the command line arguments codejava jar ltarg1gt ltarg2gt ... MyJarFile.jarcode based on the system architecture invoking the 64 bit JVM coded64code or not and setting the heap size via codeXmx1280Mcode max on a 32 bit system, from what I understood or asking for 4 GB if its a 64 bit architecture. Checking the Java version via codejava versioncode shows me that I have a 64 bit JVM running and checking the PATH in the environment variables confirms it. Now, everything is OK if I launch the wrapper via the command line. The actual .jar file is launched with an allocated 4GB of memory. If I double click the wrapper from Windows explorer, the actual .jar file is launched with the minimum e.g., 247 MB of memory. strongNotestrong that I have also set the codeXms512MBcode in the command arguments, which apparently is ignored if launching the wrapper from the Windows UI. It is true, that on the machines that I experience the problem, both 32 bit and 64 bit versions of Java are installed. Checking the Windows registry regedit under local machinejarFile entry, I see that it is linked to the 32 bit version of the runtime environment. If I change it there, it works, but as soon as a java update is installed, the registry setting is reverted. Any ideas why this is happening I did not test on UNIX systems yet as the application is mainly used on Windows. Thank you.p
Negative 26084 pI am allowing users to create custom forms with any number of inputs and elements of their choosing.

I launched an EC2 Ubuntu instance, and tried it out with EW4, and had no luck. So I tested it on FileZilla using the exact same credentials, and it connected but didnt make any changes when I transferred the file I changed a word in the body, and didnt see it change on my site. Here is how connected to FileZillap  p Uploaded my .pem file location  Used the PublicDNS for my Ubuntu instance as my host  Username ubuntu default  Password emleft blankem from what I understand, FileZilla decrypts it from the .pem file that I uploadedp  pGuessing it has something to do with me configuring my instance incorrectly or missing a step because the FileZilla transfers didnt show up on my site. Do I need to point my instance to the S3 bucket that holds my site files somehow Do I use different credentials for MS EW4 compared to Filezilla p  pIve been searching for days and still havent found a clear answer  any insight would be a huge help. Please let me know if I left any important details out and Id be happy to clarify. Thanks in advancep
Negative 26084 pI have a file that is several G in size and contains a JSON hash on each line.  The document itself is emnotem a valid JSON document, however I have no control over the generation of this data so I cannot change it.p  pThe JSON needs to be read, lookups need to be performed on certain fields in the JSON and then the result of these lookups needs to be inserted into a MySQL database.p  pAt the moment, it is taking hours to process this file and I think that it is because I am inserting and commiting on each row instead of using executemany, however Im struggling to work out how best to approach this because I need to do the lookups as part of the process and then insert into multiple tables.p  pThe process is effectively as followsp  p1 Iterate over the file, reading each line as we gop  p2 For each line, work out if it needs to be inserted into the databasep  p3 If the line does need to be inserted into the database, look up foreign keys for various JSON fields and replace them with the FK idp  p4 Insert the new line into the database.p  pThe issue comes at 3 as there are some cases where the FK id is emcreatedem by an insert of a subset of the data.p  pIn short, I need to do a mass insert of a nested data structure with various parts of the nested data needing to be inserted into different tables whilst maintaining referential integrity.p  pThanks for all and any help,p  pMattp

So both of these rails sounding gems are in the Gemfile.lock.p  pMy assumption is that the attempt to detect Rails happens first, it sees some rails related items in the Gemfile.lock and then treats it as a Rails app from then on.p  pIs there a way to tell Heroku to treat it as a Rack app regardless of what the detection thinksp  pThanks, Gavp

Negative 26084 pI am working on a C project that uses some unmanaged C code encapsulated in a dll. I have to load that dll as a Reference not DllImport, so Im writing a managed C Wrapper as a bridge between C and the dll. p  pI can easily call the dll functions from C, just calling the equivalent functions in the wrapper from C, and then calling the dll functions from the wrapper. However, there are some callback functions in the dll that should call C functions, and that part doesnt work. I have studied several tutorials about this kind of interop stackoverflow, microsoft, codeproject, but they are quite old and I cant make them work.p  pThe idea is that the dll is processing real time data, and everytime the dll generates some results, it should call a function in Program.cs, which uses those results.p  pThe code Im working on is huge, so Ive made a very simple scenario that includes everything that doesnt work.p  pIn Program.cs Im trying to tell the dll take this function Test and call it when you are done. Then, to test it, I force it to run the callback function. But I find several errors.p  pAlthough wrapper compiles and generates wrapper.dll, when I load it in the C project, the function MsetCallback isnt there . p  pI wonder if somebody could give me a hand or show me a tutorial that explains how to do that the tutorials I found dont have the 3 projects I must use, and I cant make them work.

Negative 26084 pI am building an angularjs .net application with WebApi2 and SQL Server 2008.When page loads, it sends multiple ajax calls to WebApi. WebApi then in turn passes on these calls to Sql server, but when I look into sql profiler, all calls to db are executed with same SPID,which I believe is a sequential execution rather than parallel execution of stored procs.            Even after having looking at the network monitor tab on firefox browser, all these calls return one after another and not at the same time.This might create bottleneck in the system , as angular sends parallel request to webapi but sql server is executing each request sequentially rather than parallel. I have used Data Access Application Block v6.0 and have put Connection and Command objects under Using scope. Still it fires all my storedproc with same SPID. Is there anything which I am doing wrong herep

Negative 26084 pIs it possible to create a column on a MySQL table using Sequelize that can be initialized when creating a new row, but never updatedp  pFor example, a REST service allows a user to update his profile. He can change any field except his codeidcode. I can strip the codeidcode from the request on the API route, but thats a little redundant because there are a number of different models that behave similarly. Ideally, Id like to be able to define a constraint in Sequelize that prevents the codeidcode column from being set to anything other than codeDEFAULTcode.p  pCurrently, Im using a codesetterMethodcode for the codeidcode to manually throw a codeValidationErrorcode, but this seems hackish, so I was wondering if theres a cleaner way of doing this. Even worse is that this implementation still allows the codeidcode to be set when creating a new record, but I dont know a way around this as when Sequelize generates the query it calls codesetterMethods.idcode to set the value to codeDEFAULTcode.p  precodereturn sequelize.defineFoo,              title              type DataTypes.STRING,             allowNull false,             unique true,             validate                  notEmpty true                           ,              setterMethods              id function value                  if this.isNewRecord                      throw new sequelize.ValidationErrornull, [                         new sequelize.ValidationErrorItemreadonly, id may not be set, id, value                     ]                                              codepre

Negative 26084 pThis is a mathematical question, but it is tied to the numpy implementation, so I decided to ask it at SO.

For example codeX[0]code is DFT of codexcode at frequency codefreq[0]code, codeX[1]code is DFT of codexcode at frequency codefreq[1]code, and so on.p  pBut when I compute DFT of a simple signal by hand with the formula quoted above, my results indicate that codeX[1]code is DFT of codexcode at frequency code1code, not at codefreq[1]code, codeX[2]code is DFT of codexcode at frequency code2code, etc, not at codefreq[2]code, etc.p  pAs an examplep  precodeIn [32] x Out[32] [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]  In [33] X Out[33]  array[     1.000000000.j,      0.809016990.58778525j,     0.309016990.95105652j,  0.309016990.95105652j,     0.809016990.58778525j]  In [34] freq Out[34] array[ 0. ,  0.2,  0.4, 0.4, 0.2] codepre  pIf I compute DFT of above signal for codek  0.2code or codefreq[1]code, I get codeXcode at codefreq  0.2 0.876  0.482jcode, which isnt codeX[1]code.p  pIf however I compute for codek  1code I get the same results as are in codeX[1]code or code0.809  0.588jcode.p  pSo what am I misunderstanding If codenumpy.fft.fftx[n]code is a DFT of codexcode at frequency codencode, not at frequency codenumpy.fft.fttfreqlenx[n]code, what is the purpose of codenumpy.fft.fttfreqcodep

Is there a simple way to just have the thread wait for the lock to become available  IsWriteLockHeld property says it just tests if the current thread is locked.  WaitingWriteCount says it gives the number of threads waiting to enter but how do you make a thread wait to enter  I could not find that in any samples.  Am I meant to just loop until it does not throw an exception  That does not seem right.p

Negative 26084 pemOther similar questions ask about codeltinput typefile gtcode elements. This question is about the different behaviour of codeltinput typetext gtcode elements in different browsers.emp  pFor a picturestory creation web app, users can drag an image from their desktop to a browser window. In all browsers, on all platforms, JavaScript can read in the file as a dataURL and display the image.p  pIt would be good if the the web app could store the full path to the image file in local storage, along with the rest of the story, so that the complete story can be recreated the next time the app is launched. One alternative is to copy image file in its entirety to local storage, which will soon fill up the available space. Another alternative would be to upload the image file to a server, and download it again so that it is stored in the browsers cache.p  pSaving just the path to the image file seems the most efficient.p  pI have noticed a solution which works on Safari at least. If I create an HTML input element like this...p  precodeltinput typetext placeholderDrag files heregt codepre  p... and then drag files to this input element, on Safari, the full path to the desktop file is displayed in the input element, and is accessible to JavaScript.p  pThe result is different on different browsers that I have testedp  ul liSafari makes full file path accessible to JavaScriptli liChrome and Opera open a new page to display one of the images dropped on the app page, unless JavaScript is used to prevent thisli liFirefox does nothingli ul  pMy questionsp  ol liIs Safaris behaviour a security threat, in any wayli liIf it is not a security threat, is it possible to give users the possibility of providing the full file path on other browsersli ol  pHeres a a hrefhttpsjsfiddle.neta2xtsnzu relnofollowjsFiddleap

Negative 26084 pI may not completely understand mocking as I have a burning question about a very basic scenario. How does one test an instance method of a class OR how does one test a category method for a classp  pConsider a class codePeerMessagecode which defines a few properties, etc. I create my own custom category for codePeerMessagecode called codeTypecode where I define a method, codeisTextMessagecode. codeisTextMessagecode returns a boolean value based on the contents of a codePeerMessagecode. Please not that this is just an sample type.p  pIn a test with OCMock, I configure a mock of type codePeerMessagecode and set its content to some valid value as followsp  precodeid peerMessage  [OCMockObject mockForClass[PeerMessage class]] [[[peerMessage stub] andReturnltvalidgt] content] codepre  pAnd then assert that peerMessage is a text messagep  precodeXCTAssert[peerMessage isTextMessage] codepre  pConsidering how mocking works, this results in Unexpected method invoked. Clearly, as I didnt specify that I was expecting it neither did I stub it. As I just wanted to verify this API.p  pHow does one test these instance methods in this case, category instance methods. One way to do this is to redesign the category as followsp  pInstead ofp  precode BOOLisTextMessage codepre  pdop  precode BOOLisTextMessagePeerMessage message codepre  pBut this is to me is very unnatural and I dont feel like writing this code although I dont see anything wrong with it. It doesnt need to be class method. p  pIf my explanation for the question is a bit ambiguous, Id be happy to update.p

Negative 26084 pIm having a tricky issue with the Web Audio API AudioSourceBufferNode and its onended event.p  pBasically what Id like to do is have two AudioSourceBufferNodes that are each triggered when the other one finishes and keep playing backandforth. I understand that AudioSourceBufferNodes are pretty much done once you call start and theyre designed to be garbagecollected after this. So I tried to work around that like sop  precodevar source1 var source2  source1  getSoundbuffer1 source2  getSoundbuffer2 source1.start  source1.onended  function     source2  getSoundbuffer2     source2.start   source2.onended  function     source1  getSoundbuffer1     source1.start   function getSoundbuffer     var src  context.createBufferSource     src.buffer  buffer     src.connectcontext.destination     return src  codepre  pThis may look pretty cumbersome, but I have pretty specific reasons for doing the whole backandforth playing thing, so Id really like to figure that out. At any rate, the problem seems to be that when I call codesource2.startcode inside the codesource1.onendedcode callback, codesource2.onendedcode doesnt appear to hear when it ends and never gets called. So it also stands to reason that if I ever manage to get inside the codesource2.onendedcode callback, codesource1.onendedcode will not hear the newlyreassigned codesource1code either.p  pSo I guess what I want to know is, what is the scope of the onended event, and is there a better way to accomplish what Im trying to dop

Negative 26084 pThe input file will have the name of a lake on one line, then a comma, then the volume of that lake in units of hundreds of cubic miles. The next line will contain the name of another lake, a comma, then its volume, etc, etc. Each line of the file contains exactly the name of a lake, a comma, and a float value for volume.The name of a lake may contain more than one word for example dead horse lake, but it will be on one formatted line. The volume may have decimals in it, as 16.9. Your program will use a subroutine that takes as arguments the name of a lake and its volume. This subroutine will then print out the name of the lake on one line to the screen, followed by a set of consecutive asterisks denoting the volume in units of hundreds of cubic miles on the next line rounded to the nearest hundred cubic miles. For example, if the lake is 15.6 cubic miles in volume, the subroutine will print out 16 asterisks on the line following the name of the lake.p  pRight now my program only reads the first line and displays the name and asterisk, but any other information in my lakes.txt file is not read and the program terminates. Could someone please tell me what I am doing wrong The original project was one without the comma, but the prof. decided to add a comma in there.

Negative 26084 pI have been handed an existing application that uses Location ServicesGPS to track driving behaviour. I have been reading about the impact Location ServicesGPS  can have on the battery but am coming across some seemingly contradictory information. I would like to know which of the following descriptions is more likely to be correct.p  ol lipHaving Location ServicesGPS enabled and registering for updates is not, in itself, that expensive on the battery and that Location ServicesGPS sucks about 35mAhour. However, if you are doing a lot of processing on the location updates say once a second that is a more significant battery drain  file IO, database IO, processing on the differences between current and previous location update etc. pli lipHaving Location ServicesGPS enabled and registering for updates is keeping the device awake continually. Any additional processing such as that described above that you do while that device is awake will have minimal additional impact on battery drain...the mere fact that the device is continually awake is the main culprit.pli ol  pMost apps aside from audiomovie playback do not do continual IO and processing for minuteshours on end. An app that records driving behaviour could do this so there is a need to determine how battery expensive these operations are compared to the simply adding the updates to an array in memory. p  pI appreciate fully that the situation described in scenario 1 is probably not ideal and that you would probably not design an app to be doing extensive processing and IO with every Location update. If you were designing an app from scratch you would probably hold the updates in memory and do batch updates periodically. p  pSo, given that scenario 1 exists in the app I have been asked to maintain, I wanted to be know if a rewrite to migrate to a batched solution would have any significant impact on battery life.p  pThanksp

The following is an examplep  precodegt f  function i  1 g gt g  function eval.parentsubstitutei gt f [1] 1 codepre  pThis works as expected. The expression codeicode is evaluated in the environment that called codegcode, the body of codefcode, and code1code is the result.p  pHowever, if I define codeicode in the body of codegcode as well, then that value is used instead despite the expression being evaluated in the parent frame.p  precodegt g  function i  2 eval.parentsubstitutei gt f [1] 2 codepre  pWhy is the result code2code in this case The definition of codei  2code should be completely ignored by codeeval.parentcode because the expression is evaluated in the parent frame.

The original purpose was to return latitude and longitude coordinates with 6 decimal places. But RANDMAX in MSVC is 32767, so coderand  360000000  1000000.0code is codeequivalent to rand1000000.0code which returns a value ranging from 1e6 to 0.032767. Therefore a 0.005x0.005 region encloses a lot of points. On the other hand in clang and gcc RANDMAX is 2147483647, which is the largest signed integer representable in 32 bits. The above code will generate uniformly distributed latitude and longitude pairs under clang and gcc. Hence the number of points returned from a intersection query in MSVC is way much more than that from clang or gcc. And thats why it is 10k times slower in MSVC. In VC, I changed coderand  360000000  1000000.0code to coderand  36000  100.0code and coderand  180000000  1000000.0code to coderand  18000  100.0code, the performance is now comparable.p

Negative 26084 pTraditionally in the template method pattern, a base class implements some algorithms and defers to derived classes for specific behavior. This works well in languages like CCJava because you can use protected on those methods to hide them from the callers but keep it visible for derived classes. For example, in the GoF book, you have something likep  precodeclass Application      void CreateDocument  ..., thisgtDoCreateDocument      protected void DoCreateDocument    override for custom behavior  codepre  pThis keeps the public interface for codeApplicationcode clean. In Swift, because you cannot use codeprotectedcode, the public interface is not clean. I do not want users of codeApplicationcode to see codeDoCreateDocumentcode.p  pSo Im trying another method, which instead of using methods for codeDoCreateDocumentcode, Im trying to define a closure and use functor patterns.p  precodeclass Application      typealias ActionFunc   gt      private let doCreateDocument  ActionFunc     inita  ActionFunc  self.doCreateDocument  a      func CreateDocument          self.doCreateDocument       codepre  pSo this class looks good  the public interface is clean. However, its impossible to actually use this.p  pThe obvious approach is using a derived classp  precodeclass DoApplication  Application      init          super.init             a                    This would work, but you cannot use self here                 self.  anything with self. is an error                    codepre  pThe problem with this approach is that in the initializer, you cannot pass a closure to codesuper.initcode that uses codeselfcode. I get the error codeself used before super.initcode.p  pThat basically makes it useless because you cannot access any state variables.p  pHowever, if you dont initialize codedoCreateDocumentcode in the codeinitcode, you need to expose a setter of some sorts  again, the lack of codeprotectedcode means that the setter is on the public API. Yuck.p  pSo is there any way to cleanly implement the template pattern that keeps the interface cleanp

Negative 26084 pCurrently my application has a major bottleneck when it comes to GPU CPU data sharing. p  pBasically I am selecting multiple items, each item becomes a buffer and then becomes a 2D texture of the same size and they all get blended together on the GPU. After which I need to know various things about the blend result. Which is on the GPU as a single channel float texturep  ul liMaximum amp Minimum value in the textureli liAverage valueli liSum Valueli ul  pEffectively I ended up with the very slow round about of p  ul liPut data on the GPU  Nli liRead data from GPUli liCycle data on CPU looking for valuesli ul  pObviously a CPU profile shows the 2 major hot spots as the writes and the read. the textures are in the 100x100s not 1000x1000s but there are a lot of them.p  pThere are 3 things I am currently consideringp  ol liCombine all the data amp find out interesting data before putting on GPU seems pointless putting it on the GPU at all amp some of the blends are complexli liWhen loading the data put it all onto the GPU as texture levels, therefore skipping the lag on item selection in favor of a slower loadli liCalculate the interesting data on the GPU and just have the CPU read back those values li ol  pOn my machine and the data I have worked with, throwing all the data on the GPU would barely use the GPU memory. Highest I have seen so far is 9000 entries of 170 X 90, as its single channel float, by my maths that comes out as 12 GB. Which isnt a problem on my machine, but I could see it being a problem on the average laptop. Can I get a GPU to page from HDD Is this even worth pursuing p  pSorry for asking such a broad question but I am looking for the most fruitful avenue to pursue and each avenue would be new ground to me. Profiling seems to highlight readback as the biggest problem at the moment. Could I improve this by changing FBOTexture settingsp  pAt the moment I am working in SharpGL and preferably need to stick to OpenGL 3.3.

Negative 26084 pIve tried out Bluetooth LE advertising i.e. using an Android phone as a BLE peripheral device.

XT1072 with Android 5.0.2 the cycle only runs for a while and then something goes wrong in the Bluetooth stack and a new advertising can no longer be started.

Negative 26084 pI am trying to configure a security domain for my JBoss EAP 6 application in which the primary means of authentication will be a Smart Card, but in the absence of the card will accept LDAP authentication.

Negative 26084 pSay I have twodimensional grid with evenlyspaced integer coordinates, and each grid position x,y can either be ON or OFF. Is there a way to define what shape is created by the ON positions, as a list of vertices of the polygon With the ON grid positions roughly creating the outline of a rectangles or triangle it isnt too hard. With more complex polygons, and perhaps nonconvex ones or perhaps even two polygons sidebyside I cannot seem to wrap my head around how to approach this.p  pIve seen algorithms for pointinpolygon but Im actually looking for the opposite I guess.p  pIts worth mentioning that no line created by the vertices could overlap a grid point that isnt ON because, well, otherwise it would be on. i.e. if a line overlapped at 2.8, 3.1, this would imply that grid position 2, 3 would have to be on.p

Negative 26084 pIm doing some selenium work at the office and with some recent changes to the pages I was automating Im trying to figure out the best way to do it. Im not exactly sure how to explain everything but Ill give it a try. p  pI have a payment form with different steps. Each step ask you to fill some info and they all have a continue button to go to the next step. Since every pageObject shares the same button I created an abstract class with that logic and made ever page extend from that one. p  pSomething like this removing all the code thats not relevant to the question p  precodepublic abstract class AbstractPaymentPageltT extends AbstractPaymentPagegt extends AbstractPageObject     FindByid  continueBtn   private WebElement continueButton    public AbstractPaymentPageWebDriver driver      superdriver       public T nextStep      continueButton.click     return this.initPageObjectgetNextStepClass       protected abstract ClassltTgt getNextStepClass  codepre  pAnd the child classes are defined like this p  precodepublic class PersonalInfoPage extends AbstractPaymentPageltPaymentCountryPagegt     public PersonalInfoPageWebDriver driver      superdriver       Override   protected ClassltPaymentCountryPagegt getNextStepClass      return PaymentCountryPage.class      codepre  pThe typical usage for this is would be to call codePersonalInfoPage.nextStepcode which will click on the continue button and initialize all the webElements on the next page. p  pNow, this works and Im actually pretty happy with it but it only works if the current page can tell exactly which page is coming up next. In this case PersonalInfoPage knows that the next one is PaymentCountryPage. But with these new changes there are scenarios in which the flow will be PageAPageBPageCPageD, others that can be PageAPageD and others could be PageAPageCPageD. p  pWhat do you guys think would be the best to handle something like this without ending with a ton of code duplication Was thinking that maybe I could use generic variables instead of the actual destination class for the getNextStepClass but Im not sure how that would work. p  pDunno if its clear enough to get some help but feel free to ask anything you guys think needs more explaining and all that. p
