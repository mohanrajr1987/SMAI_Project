The Python a hrefhttpswww.python.orgdevpepspep0249id15 relnofollowDBAPIa seems to imply that database libraries should be implemented using bound variables internally, yet the two Ive checked does not..p  pMySQLdb uses string inerpolation internally from a hrefhttpsgithub.comfarcepestMySQLdb1blobd34fac681487541e4be07e6978e0db233faf8252MySQLdbcursors.pyL187 relnofollowthe implementationa of codecursor.execute..codep  precodequery  query  tuple[db.literalitem for item in args] codepre  pand the codemysql.ccode a hrefhttpsgithub.comfarcepestMySQLdb1blobd34fac681487541e4be07e6978e0db233faf8252mysql.cL2030 relnofollowimplementationa usesp  precoder  mysqlrealqueryampselfgtconnection, query, len codepre  pinstead of the codemysqlstmtcode functions.p  pIn the codepsycopg2code library all execute paths seem to end up in codepsycocursexecutecode, which calls codepsycocursmergequeryargscode, which merges together a query string and its arguments. cf. a hrefhttpsgithub.compsycopgpsycopg2blobmasterpsycopgcursortype.cL307 relnofollowcodea.p  pBound parameters are supposed to be both faster and more secure, so why do these libraries do string formatting instead Since most queries will be unique, the querystatement caches will be of little use, should I dramatically reduce their sizes to prevent the cachemaintenance overheadp

Positive 256 pTogether with my team, I am working on a functionality to generate invoice numbers. The requirements says thatp  ul lithere should be no gaps between invoice numbersli lithe numbers should start from 0 every year the together with the year we will have a unique keyli lithe invoice numbers should grow accordinlgy to the time of the creation of the invoicesli ul  pWe are using php and postgres. We tought to implement this in the following wayp  ul lieach time a new invoice is persisted on the database we use a BEFORE INSERT triggerli lithe trigger executes a function that retrieves a new value from a postgres sequence and writes it on the invoice as its numberli ul  pConsidering that multiple invoices could be created during the same transaction, my question is is this a sufficiently safe approach What are its flaws How would you suggest to improve itp

Positive 256 pI am trying the PostgreSQL database for the first time, after having worked for some time with MySQL. My environment is a shared hosting with cPanel and phpPgAdmin. One thing that puzzles me is the database collation. My hostings cPanel always creates databases with the codeEncodingcode, codeCollationcode, and codeCharacter Typecode set to codeUTF8code, codeenUS.UTF8code, and codeenUS.UTF8code respectively. I dont seem to have any way to change it, because the database is created via cPanel, there are no options there, and according to this answer, these parameters can only be changed by recreating the database with the desired settings.p  pSo I was wondering does it actually matter If the collation is set to enus.UTF8, what will happen with nonEnglish and even nonLatin strings, such as Russian or Hebrew How will they be sorted p

Ive narrowed the issue down to the codeValidateVersioncode function within the a hrefhttpscode.google.comppgprovidersourcebrowsetrunkpgProviderDDLManager.cs relnofollowDDLManager.csa file in pgProvider.p  pEssentially what is happening is pgProvider is trying to check if it should autocreate the membership tables by checking if the tables already exist. However the way in which it does this is by running this queryp  precodeselect count from pgtables where schemaname  public and tablename  versions codepre  pAnd then tries to parse the result into an int, returning the bool from codeint.TryParsecode as the indicator of whether the table exists or not. But because the result that is being returned is 0 instead of NULL which I assume is what pgProvider expects if there is no table, it always evaluates to true...because obviously 0 is an int. Therefore, it thinks all the tables exist and tries to run on a query on the versions table which hasnt been created.p  pSo Im not sure if its an issue with my database returning 0 when it should return NULL or if its an issue with pgProvider not actually looking at what is returned. Where should I go from herep

Positive 256 pThis are simplified models to demonstrate my problemp  precodeclass Usermodels.Model     username  models.CharFieldmaxlength30     totalreaders  models.IntegerFielddefault0  class Bookmodels.Model     author  models.ForeignKeyUser     title  models.CharFieldmaxlength100  class Readermodels.Model     user  models.ForeignKeyUser     book  models.ForeignKeyBook codepre  pSo, we have codeUserscode, codeBookscode and codeReaderscode codeUserscode, who have read a codeBookcode. Thus, codeReadercode is basically a manytomany relationship between codeBookcode and codeUsercode.p  pNow lets say, the current user reads a book. Now, Id like to update the number of total readers for emallem books of this books authorp  precode get the book as an example pk1 book  Book.objects.getpk1   save Reader object for this user and this book Readeruserrequest.user, bookbook.save   count and save the total number of readers for this author in all his books book.author.totalreaders  Reader.objects.filterbookauthorbook.author.count book.author.save codepre  pBy doing so, Django creates a codeLEFT OUTER JOINcode query for PostgreSQL and we get the expected result. However, the database tables are huge and this has become a bottleneck.p  pIn this example, we could simply increase the codetotalreaderscode by one on each view, instead of actually counting the database rows. However, this is just a simplified model structure and we cannot do this in reality here.p  pWhat I can do, is creating another field in the Reader model called codebookauthoridcode. Thus, I denormalize data and can count the Reader objects without having PostgreSQL making the codeLEFT OUTER JOINcode with the User table. Finally, heres my question Is it possible to create some sort of database index, so that PostgreSQL handles this denormalization automatically Or do I really have to create this additional model field and redundantly store the authors PK in therep  pEDIT  to point out the essential question I got several great answers, which work for a lot of scenarios. However, they dont solve this actual problem. The only thing Id like to know, is if its possible to have PostgreSQL handle such a denormalization automatically  e.g. by creating some sort of database index.p

Positive 256 pI have a tricky problem trying to find an efficient way of ordering a set of objects 1000 rows that contain a large 5 million number of indexed data points.

If the query text is too long, I truncate it and show ellipses. Eg My very long query is...p  pCurrently, I truncate after a certain number of characters. Since the font is not monotype, a query of all Is is more narrow than a query of all Ws. Id like them to all be about the same width prior to the ellipses.

Negative 256 pIm developing an application which has a lot of text and also different modules which can be included or not in every build.p  pFor each saved project we generate automatically a report with all the details i.e. description of algorithms used in that project and so on. Currently we embed all text as strings in the source code and we also support different languages through po and mo files.p  pThe good points of the system is that it is very easy to dynamically generate documentation and report files. The bad point is that having a lot of text in source code is ugly and the formatting i.e. with html is not comfortable, editing of the text is difficult, no easy spell check and terrible to translate.p  pSo, the final question is whould you rather embed documentation in code or write external documentation files for example html for different languages and parse them on runtime Obviously the core text of the software, such us message boxes will stay in code anyway.p  pIf it matters, Im working in C with wxWidgets.p
Negative 256 pThis may be a silly question to a graphics guru which I am not, but whats the difference between affine transformations and keyframing Im reading about the former in the iPhone cookbook, and she states that Affine transforms enable you to change an objects geometry by mapping that object from one view coordinate system into another. This reminds me of when I played with Adobe After Effects, and youd set the start, in between, and finishing positions, and would get a nice visual animation. They called it keyframing. So whats the difference this and affine transormations. Is it a 2D vs 3D thing Thanks all.p

Negative 256 pWere having a very strange problem with css in DotNetNuke.p  pIt seems that with any of our custom modules, if a user clicks to postback 9 times the skin css is removed  and the page becomes rather ugly. Looking at the source the tags with the urls to the css files are gone. After one more click making 10 postbacks, any custom css files weve added are removed as well. It seems that sometimes the css will come back after more postbacks but other times it will not.p  pwhat you click on doesnt matter, just the amount of postbacks. However we have another server that on some days will behave fine, and others will have the same behavior.p  pWe cant narrow it down to anything our modules have in common. It happens in modules that do not share any code, but somehow happens in all our modules that weve tried but not in any other modules that come with DNN.p  pThough experimenting weve also found you can postback say 8 times leave the page and come back, you then can postback 9 more times before the css will be gone.p

Negative 256 pI am looking at FILESTREAM attribute in SQL Server to store files in it. I understand it stores the files on hard drive and stores the file pointerpath information in DB.

Negative 256 pIm writing some code to manage a custom on disk file structure and syncronize it to unconnected systems.  One of my requirements is to be able to estimate the size of a sync prior to actually generating the sync content.

Then sometime in the future  .Close codepre  pSo the class using the strongReportFilestrong class will create an instance, call codeWriteInfo..code multiple times until it is finished doing whatever it needs to do, then call codeClosecode at some point in the future.p  pNow I know I need to implement a Dispose pattern on the strongReportFilestrong class to ensure that if anything goes screwey that the handle to the file gets appropriately dealt with.p  pHowever I havent been able to find anything thus far on the interweb showing a good way of keeping the file open and then checking to see if it needs to be closed, most of the examples just open the file do the writing, then close it  all within a codeusingcode construct.p  pIn the strongReportFilestrong class I want to be able to check if the FileStream instance is not  closed so that I can close it and free up resource.p  pAnyone know of a good link to reference or any other advice p  pOhh I should mention that I dont do C full time, its only a hobby thing, so if this is a dumb question, my apologies p

Negative 256 pIm relatively new to clientside programming coming from the PHPMySQL environment.

So why not just use only JavaScript to set element attributesproperties And if so, is this a common practice Im sure CSS is much faster...p

Negative 256 pI am working on a lightweight document management system and am looking for some help with how best to model certain relationships.  Essentially, I am working with two organizational units codeGroupcodes and codeTypecodes.  When a group and a type are combined they form a codeLinkcode with which codeDocumentcodes are then associated.  Note that a codeGroupcode can be combined with more than one type, so for example you can have one codeLinkcode composed of Group 1 and Type A and a second codeLinkcode composed of Group 1 and Type B.  In my opinion this is not really the best way to have structured it but at this point Im unable to alter it so I have to make do with what Im given.p  pA codeDocumentcode can be a member of multiple codeLinkcodes.  So for example, Document A can be a member of Link 10 and Link 13.p  pMy issue is that sometimes I will want to display a single codeDocumentcode and list every codeLinkcode that codeDocumentcode belongs to, and other times I will want to display a single codeLinkcode and list every codeDocumentcode that belongs to that codeLinkcode.p  pIm not sure how to represent the relationship between these classes.  Ive looked into the Composite Pattern but I dont think this will work for me because it seems to require that a child have only one parent, where in my case a child can have multiple parents.  Any help would be appreciated. p

Negative 256 pIm using Qt to connect to a MySQL database through QSqlTableModel  QSqlDatabase  etc although this question is more general.p  pWhats the best way to get a live updating database table view One option would be to constantly poll the entire table repeatedly calling the select method in QSqlTableModel. This seems inefficient though is the entire table passed from MySQL to Qt each timep  pAnother option would be to have another table, which acts as a log table keeps track of all the updates  changes and then you can poll this log table checking only for new entries..which seems more efficient. However, then you lose a lot of the QSql built in functionality.p  pOr should I have a counter variable that I poll, and then if that increases, I know to refresh the entire tablep  pAll these approaches seem a bit messy.. what would you recommend Thanks.p

Negative 256 pI have some question about how GPUs perform synchronizations. As I know, when a warp encounters a barrier assuming it is in OpenCL, and it knows that the other warps of the same group havent been there yet. So it has to wait. But what exactly does that warp do during the waiting time  Is it still an active warp Or will it do some kind of null operations p  pAs I notice, when we have a synchronization in the kernel, the number of instructions increases. I wonder what is the source of this increment. Is the synchronization broken down into that many smaller GPU instructions Or because the idle warps perform some extra instructionsp  pAnd finally, I strongly wonder if the cost added by a synchronization, compared to one without synch, lets say barrierCLKLOCALMEMFENCE is affected by the number of warp in a workgroup or threadblock Thanksp

Negative 256 pI am writing an Android app which submits a username and password to a Java Servlet hosted on Google App Engine. I am writing both the Android app. and Servlet. p  pThe username and password are packaged into a POST request on the device and the servlet doPost method checks the values.  If the username and password are correct I request a session...creating it if it doesnt existp  precodeHttpSession session  request.getSessiontrue codepre  pIn this session I store a name value pair logged and true.p  pBack on the android device a cookie is returned along with an HTTP status of 200 OK.  This all seems fine, since the session on the server is implemented using cookies transparent to me since Im just using the session API.p  pAll subsequent HTTP POSTs made by the android device package up the cookie into the HTTP POST so that it can request .jsp pages or use other servlets which inspect the session for the logged and true value i.e. protected pages.p  pThe problem A cookie is returned even if the following code is NOT runp  precodeHttpSession session  request.getSessiontrue codepre  pi.e. the username and password were false.  This isnt such a security issue since the logged and true name value pair is never set so the application cannot use the .jsp or other servlets. However, I was using the fact that a cookie had been returned from the POST request to the device as a sign that authentication was successful.p  pWhy am I getting a cookie even though I dont use or request the use of a sessionp  pMy current solution is to create an additional cookie in the servlet and check for this cookie on the device. HOWEVER, this cookie is not the one packaged into subsequent POSTS from the device since it is not the cookie associated with the session containing the  logged true value.  This seems hacky. Clearly I ave misunderstood something.p

Negative 256 pok so, i have this dilemma on how i should save login credentials in mvc at the same time avoid as much hit on the database. i know i can easily use codeForms Authenticationcode to save a User instance but is it advisablep  pAt the moment the way I do it is I store the codeUser Idcode in a codecookiecode which i then would access everytime an Action gets called that would require a login access. Before the action gets accessed the User Id will be used to retrieve a New User instance. This will be the same on every Action, I dont store the User in the cookie as I feel like once the cookie is compromised everything about the User shall be available for the hacker Userid, email, roles, etcp  pSo if i have a ton of actions that would require a login that will be difficult on my bandwidth. What do you think of the method Im using Should I change it to have all the User object be stored in the cookie with a short timeout Any ideas are greatly appreciated. thanksp

Negative 256 pI am facing an interesting problem with SVG and iOS.p  pI need to render very long SVG files up to about 5mb large, which hasnt been a problem using UIWebView. I also havent had a problem scrolling them smoothly with JS, but since Im waiting on my developer program application to be approved I havent tested the performance on an actual device.p  pIm now trying to achieve a pageturning effect like how the iBooks app flips pages. It doesnt have to be as elaborate and intricate, the gist of the idea is that the next section of the svg will wipe over the last.p  pReason being, I need both pages of content to remain static to ease the reading of the content during the flipping process. Scrolling very quickly makes the contents of the SVG difficult to read.p  pHere is a graphic representation of what I would like to achievep  precode                                                                                           1                                                                                                                                                                                                      2            1               gt                                                                                                                                                                                   2          1                      gt                                                                                                                                                                            2                                                                                                                      codepre  pLooking forward to some interesting ideas from you veteransp

Negative 256 pIm programming C on an embedded system.  The processor architecture is 32 bits codesizeofintcode is 32 bits, codesizeofshortcode is 16 bits.  There is a 32bit variable that is a memorymapped control register codeCTRLREGcode that is specified as only the bottom 16 bits being used, and they contain a signed 16 bit integer value writing to the higher bits has no effect.  Memory accesses must be 32bit aligned, so I cant just bump the pointer over a couple bytes, and also I cannot assume an endianness.  Im concerned that automatic type promotion is going to mess with whatever Im storing by extending the sign bit out to bit 31 instead of leaving it at bit 15 where I want it.  What is the best way to store something in this locationp  pHere was my original code, which I am nearly certain is wrongp  precodedefine CTRLREG   volatile unsigned int 0x4000D008u short calibrationValue  CTRLREG  2  calibrationValue codepre  pThen I tried this, but I think it still might be subject to integer promotion at the point of the assignmentp  precodeCTRLREG  short2  calibrationValue codepre  pThen finally I thought of thisp  precodeCTRLREG  unsigned shortshort2  calibrationValue codepre  pI cant evaluate these options very well because they all work in my tests because codecalibrationValuecode happens to be negative its a calibration parameter specific to each device, and so could be positive on some devices, so after multiplying by 2, I end up storing a positive value and thus I dont actually run into the problem Im expecting in my tests.p  pYour help is greatly appreciated, even if its just to say youre thinking too much.p

Negative 256 pim developing a simple game, in which there are bricks , ball and a paddle where you should hit the bricks with the ball you all know this game.p  pMy problem is a bit complicated, the ball is moving in constant speed, lets assume 200px per second, and lets assume i have 30 frames per second. this means that each frame the ball moves about 7 pixels.p  pi have 2 things i do each frame   1. draw the game on the screen. 2. move the ball, collision detection etc.. p  pthe problem is that in frame X the ball didnt hit anything yet but in frame X1 he moves 7 pixels and then he is partially inside a brick or partially inside two adjacent bricks which is much worse.p  pthis happens because the movement is discrete and not continuous.p  pI dont really know how should i deal with it, i got this problem in every game i developed not only for android but also in PC. probably im missing something crucial in my understanding of game development.p  pthanks in advance.p

Negative 256 pRequirement The service should monitor 4 different systems and as and when a new file is created on any of these systems, the file should be moved to a server location.  Moving need not be an immediate priority but eventually have to move it. These system generate files in bulk 30 files systemmin, while sometimes the systems are just idle. So there is no fix time for file generation.  Also the service should have a user interface so the configuration would be set by the user.p  pInitial thought The service would be installed on the server location. The service will monitor 4 different folders on these 4 systems. Monitoring will be done by using FileSystemWatcher on these folders. The files will be moved to a folder located on the server.p  pAny suggestion is appreciated or a possible different approach to work on this problemp

Negative 256 pIve inherited a VB.Net application that Im testing and the ItemCommand event is not firing... It is a VB.Net 4.0 application.p  pIve searched the web for this error and doubhle checked the code in the application. p  pI know this event is supposed to fire on a postback after the pageload event.

But, one thing stays aside not explained. p  pThey use visitor like thisp  precodeabstract class Expr    public ltTgt T acceptVisitorltTgt visitor visitor.visitthis   class ExprVisitor extends Visitor   public Integer visitNum num      return num.value       public Integer visitSum sum      return sum.getLeft.acceptthis  sum.getRight.acceptthis       public Integer visitProd prod      return prod.getLeft.acceptthis  prod.getRight.acceptthis    codepre  pInstead of calling visitelement directly, Visitor asks the element to call its visit method. There are few things in the world that are more stupid than this design even if we close our eyes on the fact that it contradicts the declared idea of class unawareness about visitors. p  pPS1 Please explain with your own words or point to exact explanation. Because two responses I got refer to something general and uncertain. p  pPS2 My guess Since getLeft returns the basic Expression, calling visitgetLeft would result in visitExpression, whereas getLeft calling visitthis will result in another, more appropriate, visit invocation. So, accept performs the type conversion aka casting. If that is right, then, why nobody Ive got 4 responses so far can come up this basic and keyimportant thing Why people keep saying that this is a worthless question insteadp  pstrongPS3strong, Those, who think that I am stupid because I cannot appreciate the great need for accept method when read on why visitor pattern is useful, please shut up, especially after a hrefhttpandymaleh.blogspot.com200804scalaspatternmatchingvisitorpattern.htmlScalas Pattern Matching  Visitor Pattern on Steroida shows how much simpler the Visitor pattern is without the accept method. a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiVisitorpatternExternallinksWikipedia adds to this statementa by linking a paper showing that accept methods are unnecessary when reflection is available introduces term Walkabout for the technique. p

Negative 256 pIm trying to stretch the content of a div the height of the page. Ive Googled the problem and so far nothing works. The whole thing is starting to give me a headache. Perhaps someone more experienced could take a look at my code The full stylesheet is 400 lines, so Im including what is hopefully relevant.p  pWrapper takes up 100 of the page height, whereas contentShadow stretches only to the height of the text in the div content.p  pEdit as far as I can tell, every container has its height set to 100, which whould make contentShadow 100 as well.

If the innodblogbuffersize filled up or time has come to flush it to the disc, they will be written onto innodblogfiles which are maintained in a group and committed in the table space at the same time.p  pNow my question is that why we should not have the collective size of innodblogfiles more than the size of the innodbbufferpool and why should we write to these log files though we are flushing it to the disc...p  pI couldnt able to get proper explanation on this over the web at least I could not  able to understand. Please give me some better explanation.p  pReally thanks in advance. Regards, UDAYp

Negative 256 pIm using Batik to work with SVG images. Specifically I have a scene with a number of shapes and I need to be able to convert each shape to a separate BufferedImage. To do this I use the following codep  precodeSVGDocument document  null   Load the document String parser  XMLResourceDescriptor.getXMLParserClassName SAXSVGDocumentFactory f  new SAXSVGDocumentFactoryparser  File file  new FileinPath try      document  SVGDocument f.createDocumentfile.toURL.toString  catch MalformedURLException e      e.printStackTrace  catch IOException e      e.printStackTrace    Build the tree and get the document dimensions UserAgentAdapter userAgentAdapter  new UserAgentAdapter BridgeContext bridgeContext  new BridgeContextuserAgentAdapter  GVTBuilder builder  new GVTBuilder  GraphicsNode graphicsNode  builder.buildbridgeContext, document CanvasGraphicsNode canvasGraphicsNode  CanvasGraphicsNode         graphicsNode.getRoot.getChildren.get0  ifcanvasGraphicsNode.getChildren.geti instanceof ShapeNode     currentNode  ShapeNode canvasGraphicsNode.getChildren.geti     convertNodeToImage currentNode  codepre  pThis is pretty standard. I fire up Batik and get it to parse the SVG file. Heres the convert node to image functionp  precodeRectangle2D bounds BufferedImage bufferedImage Graphics2D g2d   This is supposed to get the bounds of the svg node. i.e. the rectangle which would  fit perfectly around the shape    bounds  sn.getSensitiveBounds   Transform the shape so its in the top left hand corner based on the bounds sn.setTransformAffineTransform.getTranslateInstancebounds.getX, bounds.getY   Create a buffered image of the same size as the svg node          bufferedImage  new BufferedImageint bounds.getWidth, int bounds.getHeight,                 BufferedImage.TYPEINTARGB   Paint the node to the buffered image and convert the buffered image to an input         stream            g2d  Graphics2D bufferedImage.getGraphics sn.paintg2d  ByteArrayOutputStream os  new ByteArrayOutputStream ImageIO.writebufferedImage, png, os InputStream is  new ByteArrayInputStreamos.toByteArray return is codepre  pThis works fine for rectangles and straight line shapes but it doesnt work for splines. For splines the bounds are greater than the rendered spline. I think this is because the getBounds function is including the control points in the bounds calculation. I need to find the bounds of just the spline i.e. if the spline were stroked Id like to find the bounds of that stroke. Ive tried all the getBounds functions getSensativeBounds, getGeometryBounds... and they all give me the same result. So Im wondering if Ive missed something This is a bug in Batik Or if theres a workaroundp  pA workaround I thought of would be to get a list of vertices of the shape and calculate the bounds manually. Ive been unable to find how to get a list of the outline vertices however. p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated. p

However, there is a chance that when I execute the linep  precodeImagePlus image  new ImagePluspath codepre  pwhere path is a user specified path to an image, the image may not be there.  The ImageJ library will not throw an error until methods of codeimagecode are accessed, and at that time, ImageJ will print to the console codeThere are no images open.code and terminate the program.  I believe that ImageJ is actually calling codeSystem.exitcode when it prints that line since my whole application terminates  incuding Deamon threads.p  pIs there a way using ImageJ to check if an image was successfully opened  Or should I just check if the file exists by using Javas File classp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pTo clarify, this is a multithreaded application that may attempt to open and process many images at the same time.  The ImageJ class codeIJcode has functions to open images, but codeIJcode is a singleton class, and thus has odd behavior when multiple calls to codeIJ.openImagestringcode occur at the same time.p

Negative 256 pI am creating one website which uses CSS3 fullscreen gallery. This is my first time i am using CSS3 for fullscreen images, rather than JS. p  pThe thing is that the backgroundsizecover property which i am using is not doing what i think it should be doing.

Negative 256 pI am looking to use the IIS Application Request Routing as a reverse proxy cache. Ive looked at several different options and come to the conclusion that it fits my needs the best. However, Ive run into a sort of a dead end and could really use some input from someone who has more experience with the ARR module.p  pI have the following setupp  ul liIIS ARR cache proxying requests to an internal server farm weighted round robin loadbalancing to use the nearest origin server.li liKeep alive is disabled in the IIS proxies.li liThe server farm consists of nginx webservers.li liThe IIS servers have RAM disk caches.li ul  pThe use case is such that the edge servers will receive byte range requests and as it serves the content to the end user it will cache it first 60 sec in memory cache, then write it to the RAM disk. So far everything is working correctly but when the next end user starts requesting the same byte ranges that are now in the cache Im starting so see some weird behaviour between the IIS edges and the nginx origins Upon the first byte range request by the second end user the IIS server opens a connection to the nginx origin which it does not use because it already has the requested segments in the cache. Since the connection isnt being used its eventually closed by nginx due to a timeout 60 seconds. In the mean time the second end user is still requesting segments of the file that are in the cache. Then, and this is where the issue occurs, the second end user gets to a point in the file which is not in the cache. The behaviour I would expect from IIS here being that keepalive is disabled is that it would open up a new connection to the origin and start fetching the part of the file that isnt in the cache. The behaviour Im seeing however is that IIS tries to reuse the same connection it opened up in the beginning of the request without realizing that its been dropped by the origin. Ive used the Failed request tracing to verify this as well and the result of that is that the IIS doesnt get an expected reply from the origin since the connection no longer exists and then, in turn, returns a 502.3 to the end user.p  pIve verified that increasing the connection timeout on the origins will solve the problem, but that is not really a viable solution as I would basically have to set an infinite timeout which may cause a whole new set of problems on the origin side. Is there any way of controlling how IIS handles this upstream connection i.e. force it to open a new connection when it actually needs data from the origin, or to have it realize that the origin closed the connectionp

Negative 256 pIm working with GWT Java, Im new to jQuery. I dont really know what to search for to clarify this problem. Maybe someone can point me in the right direction. Originally, I wanted a multi file upload form in GWT, but the GWT FormPanel only accepts 1 file at a time.  So Im looking at blueimpjQueryFileUpload.p  pTheres code here a hrefhttpsgithub.comblueimpjQueryFileUploadwikiGoogleAppEngineJava relnofollowhttpsgithub.comblueimpjQueryFileUploadwikiGoogleAppEngineJavaa for using blueimpjQueryFileUpload with App Engine in Java. The server side code seems to make sense, but I cant test it as the front end seems to do absolutely nothing.p  pI include the jQuery code myjqueryfunctions.jsp  pin the HTML head, just after jquery1.8.2.min.js p  pIve read basic stuff about  jQuery which says that typical jQuery syntax is for an event handler selector.actionp  pBut the code here  at code link above starts with function      fileupload.fileupload  p  pI would expect such code to be called by a click of an upload button, but theres no such button, only a browse button, amp this is not referenced in the HTML. Why hasnt  the form got an upload  button p  pIf I add     alertjQ called   near top of the jQuery function there is no alert, confirming that the function never gets called.p  pAm I mising something or is this sample code rubbishp

Negative 256 pemNote Im working with a large complex database, so for claritys sake I have simplified the set up below.emp  pI struggled a bit with how to title the question since its a bit of a complex question. I hope its accurate enough....p  pstrongA bit of background firststrongp  pI have an Access 2010 database that contains a onetomany relationship between a table Called Products and a table called Datasets ie I have a bunch of products, and each product has multiple datasets. Each has an autonumber key field pID and dID respectively as well as numerous other fields.p  pI have a form lets call it frmMain that has two subforms subProducts based on the Products table and subDatasets based on the Datasets table. On the main form I have a control ctrlSelectedProduct which is linked to [subProducts][pID] to see which record in subProducts is selected  has the focus, and the subDatasets subform is linked to this control so that it only displays Datasets records that belong to the selected Products record.p  pOn the main form I also have a number of controls that Im using for filtering the data in the subforms. For example, I have a control ctrlCategory. I have this control coded so that when the user changes the value of the control, a filter is applied that limits the records in subProducts to only those that have a pCategory value equal to whatever is chosen in ctrlCategory. If the control is blank, it will show all records. All this works great when if comes to filtering based on fields in the Products table.p  pstrongNow the problemstrongp  pMy problem is that I also want to be able to filter based on fields in the Datasets table. For example, Datasets has a field called dStatus. I want the user to be able to chose the status in a control ctrlStatus, and based on thisp  pstrong1strong subProducts will be filtered to display only those Products records that have an assotiated Datasets record or records that has dStatus equal to whatever was chosen in ctrlStatusp  pthenp  pstrong2strong when a Products record is selected in this filtered subProducts, subDatasets will only show the Datasets records that has dStatus equal to whatever was chosen in ctrlStatusp  pI know how to do part2. But I have no idea how to get part1 to work. Since subProducts is currently based on the Products table, which does not have the dStatus field, I have no way to filter it based on that field. Thus, Im assuming my first step will be to change my setup so that subProducts is based on a query that combines the two tables or at least adds the dStatus field.p  pIf I do that, however, I get duplicate Product records. I cant use the querys Unique Values property because if I have a product that has two datasets, one with status Current and a one with status Archived, then those arent considered duplicates, and the product info is there twice. If I dont have the status field displayed, it shows only unique products initially, but then I cant subsequently apply a filter based on that nondisplayed field.p  pI also tried basing subProducts on a Totals query in order to utilize the Group By functionality, but I still couldnt get it to work right. Even if I could I dont think thats the best solution, because you can only have 10 fields with Group By, and my Products table has more than 10 fields that I need displayed in subProducts.p  pI feel like Im now just going around in circles and am at a loss of what to try from here. Please help p

Negative 256 pBasis I am using the MVVM pattern or a subset of it. br p  pIn my main window I have a button that opens up a usercontrol with a new DataContext the function looks kinda like this p  precodepublic void SetUserControl       UCDatacontext  new UCViewModelthis      base.OnPropertyChangedUCDatacontext      UCViewVisibilty  Visibility.Visible      UCDatacontext.IniFocus   codepre  pAnd then when I am done I close the usercontrol and Dispose of the DataContext. Now the problem I am having is that I cant seem to get the focus setting to work properly, I have a Textbox in the usercontrol that I want to set focus to when the view becomes Visible. However on the first time that I attempt to set focus it only fills the text box with an unblinking caret, which after investigation leads me to believe that it is because the TB isnt getting the Keyboard focus only logical focus, however even after explicity setting the keyboard focus I still get the unblinking caret, and it is only after clicking in the TB that it is getting focus. The method I am using to set focus is similar to method described a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1356045setfocusontextboxinwpffromviewmodelcwpfherea. br  If in the view I do some writeline debugging by printing out in the FocusSet Event for the textbox it does get set, however only on the first time I call SetUserControl. If I call SetUserControl again it does nothing, except making the View Visible but doesnt trigger the Focus Set Event. br  Below is the lines of code from the MainWindowp  precodeltGrid Grid.ColumnSpan5 Grid.RowSpan5 VisibilityBinding PathUCViewVisibilty  xNameUCGrid   gt     ltGrid.Effectgt         ltDropShadowEffect  gt     ltGrid.Effectgt     ltViewUCView DataContextBinding PathUCDatacontext   gt     ltGridgt codepre  pAnd UserControl Gridbr p  precodeltGrid gt      ltTextBox UidUCTB localExtensionsFocusExtension.IsFocusedBinding PathUCTBFocus Height23 HorizontalAlignmentLeft Margin113,56,0,0 NameUCTB VerticalAlignmentTop Width165 TextBinding PathUCTBContent, UpdateSourceTriggerPropertyChanged GotFocusUCTBGotFocus gt ltGrid gt codepre  pThe Focus is set in the UserControlViewModel, and is set after the Usercontrol is rendered.p
Negative 256 pI am using Entity Framework with Visual Studio 2012 or 2010. I am working together with colleagues who have a different language version German of Visual Studio installed.p  pSome of our models use inheritance. When generating the database from the model using standard values TablePerTypeStrategy.xaml and SSDLToSQL10.tt EF generates inheritance constraints. The names of these constraints are localized xinheritsy vs xerbty. This means, every time someone makes a change to the model and generates the SQL file all the constraint names are updated with the localized version.p  pThis is starting to become a major annoyance as we need to know the names of the constraints. Sometimes we need to update already deployed databases and there is no way to know whether they have been created with the German or English constraint names. This makes writing update scripts impossible without access to the database.p  pIs there some way to prevent Visual Studio from localizing these names other than force all developers to use the same Language versionp
Negative 256 pI made a simple app using backbone.js and require.js. Earlier i used to have just one index.html file and used to dynamically renderhide different views.

Main point is, these four html files dont have the codeltDOCTYPE htmlgtlthtmlgtcode tags, just the codeltdivgtcode tags for the view.p  pIm not sure this is the right way to do it using require.js.

Negative 256 pI have an Order model and orderevent model. Each orderevent has a foreignkey to order. so from an order instance i can get codemyorder.ordereventsetcode. I want to get a list of all orders but i want them to be sorted by the date of the last event. A statement like this works to sort by the latest event datep  precodequeryset  Order.objects.all.annotate     latesteventdateMaxordereventeventdatetime     .orderbylatesteventdate codepre  pHowever, what I really need is a list of all orders sorted by latest date of A SUBSET OF EVENTS. For example my events are categorized into scheduling, processing, etc. So I should be able to get a list of all orders sorted by the latest scheduling event. This django doc httpsdocs.djangoproject.comendevtopicsdbaggregationfilterandexclude shows how I can get the latest schedule event using a filter but this excludes orders without a scheduling event.p  pI thought I could combine the filtered queryset with a queryset that includes back those orders that are missing a scheduling event...but Im not quite sure how to do this. I saw answers related to using python list but it would be much more useful to have a proper django queryset ie for a view with pagination, etc.p  pEDIT re commentssuggestionsp  precodeclass Ordermodels.Model     desc  models.CharFieldmaxlength30  class Ordereventmodels.Model     order  models.ForeignKeyOrder     eventdatetime  models.DateTimeFieldautonowadd  True codepre  pAlso, I dont mind doing it in more than one statement. Also, sorting, etc via python instead of the orm is ok since im not working with huge datasets. If possible I would prefer to stay away from the sql for reasons you mentioned. Combining separate, sorted querysets seems promising, but im getting stuck.p

Negative 256 pI have a Win Metro app that is a XAMLMonoGame hybrid game written in C with a XAML start page that contains a frame that gets loaded with menu buttons. p  pAfter submitting this to the Win Metro store I get a test protocol back basically just containing a screen shot of the start screen of my app and says Feature not functional with the two buttons of the start screen circled in red. There has never been a problem using those buttons on my setup two different Win 8 Machines  simulator.p  pAnother strange thing is that the back button is visible, which should not be possible as I explicitly set IsEnabled of the back button to False if the frame is the start frame originally I had the IsEnabled property binding set in XAML to emCanGoBackem of the content frame, but that did not work either.p  pThis is the code for setting the visibility of the back button when the user navigates.p  precode    public MainPage              this.InitializeComponent          contentFrame.NavigatetypeofMainFrame          Window.Current.SizeChanged  VisualStateChanged         contentFrame.Navigated  contentFrameNavigated           void contentFrameNavigatedobject sender, NavigationEventArgs e              ApplicationViewState visualState  ApplicationView.Value          VisualStateManager.GoToStateControle.Content,                 visualState.ToString, false          if e.Content is MainFrame             backButton.IsEnabled  false         else             backButton.IsEnabled  contentFrame.CanGoBack           private void backButtonClickobject sender, RoutedEventArgs e              contentFrame.GoBack           internal void GoHome              while contentFrame.CanGoBack              contentFrame.GoBack      codepre  pGoHome is called from the game page if a user opts to quit the game there I dont get to see any back button in the start page from there eitherp  precode    private void QuitGameIUICommand command              App.ClearGame          Window.Current.Content  App.MainPage         Window.Current.Activate         App.MainPage.GoHome      codepre  pAnd here is the code for the buttons in the MainFramep  precode    private void onePlayerButtonClickobject sender, RoutedEventArgs e              this.Frame.NavigatetypeofOnePlayerFrame           private void twoPlayersButtonClickobject sender, RoutedEventArgs e              this.Frame.NavigatetypeofTwoPlayersFrame      codepre  pSo my question is can the visibility of the back button be handled differently on a Surface device compared to on a Desktop PC, or how can the tester otherwise get a screen shot where the back button is visible And  do any of you have similar experiences when submitting apps to the Windows Metro storep  pI really wish Microsoft would give more detail in the test protocol, it would save time for everyone in the long run...p

Negative 256 pI just went through our a hrefhttpwww.vbparadise.deprogrammierenhauptforum87169codemodifikationenanframeworkassemblies relnofollowgerman VB.NET forumsa and there was something interesting that gives me some kind of headache.p  pIt is actually possible to emeditem the .NET Framework assemblies using ReflexIL or some other IL editor. The only thing you have to bypass is the Strong Name signature of the assembly. After changing the assembly IL, you have to run codesn.exe Vr [assemblyname]code to kinda skip the strong name validation. After that you have to clear the cached native images. Just go through the codeCWindowsassemblycode directory and delete every image related to your assembly. Then reboot. When you are logged in, run codengen install [assemblyname]code. Now the strongnewstrong native images are generated.p  pThis works. I verified this procedure in my virtual environment Windows XP x86. Now the thing that worries me the most is that you can easily bypass the .NET a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.security.cryptography.rsacryptoserviceprovider.verifyhash.aspx relnofollowcodeVerifyHashcodea or a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary55yk5665.aspx relnofollowcodeVerifyDatacodea methods of the codeRSACryptoServiceProvidercode. This actually works, too. A friend of mine and me tested could verify this issue a hrefhttpwww.vbparadise.deprogrammierenhauptforump718868codemodifikationenanframeworkassembliespost718868 relnofollowsee screenshotsa. That was fairly easy.p  pFor example, if Id create a licensing system built on the .NET Framework cryptography classes, it could be bypassed strongsystemwidestrong for strongeverystrong .NET application on the system using the framework. Also, everybody can emlogem and emchangeem the input of functios that I call just by hooking into the methods.p  pNow my question is Since this can be a huge problem, how can I do something about that Of course a malicious user could just edit emmyem application, but that would not be as bad as doing this systemwide. I was thinking about some framework checksum validation, but since there are alot of different updates for the .NET Framework, this seems to be impossible.p  pAny solutions or suggestions Does Microsoft take care of this problem in some wayp

The issue Im facing is that a hrefhttpcode.google.compsuperobject relnofollowSuperObjecta still isnt crossplatform compatible with Firemonkey. By all means, I used it in the original version of the product, but now I want to create a crossplatform version as opposed to one limited to just Windows, Im finding it to be a hassle.p  pcodeDBXJSONcode is the only crossplatform solution Ive been able to find after extensive hours of research, but thats proving to be frustrating to try and deal with.

Negative 256 pI have a WCF service on .NET 4 with a custom UserNamePasswordValidator, secured with SSL and message security.p  pThe UserNamePasswordValidator receives the user name and password and passes it to a stored procedure that returns the valid account token for that user name and password.p  pMy problem is that I dont understand how to access that account token in the actual web service. I suspect that I must be able to add the token to a header somewhere, but OperationContext does not exist yet in the UserNamePasswordValidator and setting it on HttpContext fails with An error occurred when verifying security for the message.p  pFrom my googling, it appears that I must implement either IAuthorizationPolicy or IIdentity, but neither of those will have access to the password. p  pI would think that many services would take a user name and password and use that to find the relevant account. Am I overcomplicating it, or am I just missing something obviousp

Negative 256 pIm using inproc zmq sockets for multithreaded data sharing.  I have multiple thread clients to one master thread each client has a PUSH socket and the master has a PULL socket acting as a sink for all clients.  For the most part each client is independent, but I do have some modest order requirements since one client thread is rather special.p  pHere is some code that illustrates a variation on my problemp  precodeimport threading import zmq  context  zmq.Context  pull  context.socketzmq.PULL pull.bindinprocmysocket  def slave     global context     push  context.socketzmq.PUSH     push.connectinprocmysocket      for x in one two three.split          push.sendgtgtgt x     push.sendEND     push.close  def master     global context     push  context.socketzmq.PUSH     push.connectinprocmysocket      for x in one two three.split          push.sendx      x  threading.Threadtargetslave     x.start      while x.isalive         pass      push.sendEND     push.close  thread  threading.Threadtargetmaster thread.start  while True     if pull.poll         x  pull.recv         if x  END             print END  exiting             break         print x codepre  pThe fact that the slave thread is started entirely after the master thread has sent its main payload led me to expect all of masters data before slaves data.  However that is not consistently the case.  Consider the following output in reality, the order is not consistent, but I really did get this orderp  precode python zmqthreads.py  one two gtgtgt one three gtgtgt two END  exiting codepre  pI wanted the following order reliably and I believe this order is forced by the masterslave arrangement as far as send goesp  precode python zmqthreads.py  one two three gtgtgt one gtgtgt two gtgtgt three END  exiting codepre  pThinking on it, I can see that multiple socket clients would not promise this sort of synchronization.  However, it feels like I should be able to flush something somehow to force the order of recv especially with the inproc transport.  Any ideasp

Now I am defining in the web config of my webrole. I notice when I set autoflush to true in the webconfig, every thing works but scheduledTransferPeriod is not honored because the flush method pushes to the table storage.  I would like to have scheduleTransferPeriod trigger the flush or trigger flush after a certain number of log entries like the buffer is full.  Then I can also flush on server shutdown.  Is there any method or event on the CustomTraceListener where I can listen to the scheduleTransferPeriodp  precode  ltsystem.diagnosticsgt     lthttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysk36c28tvvs.110.aspx     By default autoflush is false.

Negative 256 pI have made an app, and want to distribute it to other people for testing purpose. I have made the setup using codeInnoSetupcode. The setup is working perfectly fine and creates the required directories and shortcuts perfectly. But the problem is that as soon as I click on the myApp.exe file, instead of opening the file a error message pops up saying that  codemyApp.exe has stopped working. Windows is checking for a solution to the problemcodebr I have made sure that the correct .Net framework is installed on the users computer. I have been trying to get rid of this error from the past 4 days, but couldnt get rid of it. I made the application on windows 7 and tried running it on windows 8, when this error message comes. Earlier I made the setup using the Install Shield project in visual studio 2012 and that setup was working correctly in both windows 7 and 8. Unfortunately, I couldnt get a computer running windows 7 other than my computer, to check whether the codeInnoSetupcode setup is working on windows 7 or not.  There is nothing in the Apps code that will prevent it from running on windows 8.br I had read somewhere that when you run the App as administrator the exact error message pops up. But that is also not happening.  What could be the possible reasons for itbr How can I get the exact error message, so as to know  why this is happeningp

Negative 256 pIm looking for a way to unit test my a C application linked into an executable. Im using googletest and I need to link the test executable to the binary under test in order to test that binary. The binary under test is an executable in my case. On Windows I can create an import library for the tested executable and link the test executable with it. As long as I dont export the main function from the tested binary, it works fine.  However on Linux Im not able to do this. When linking directly with the tested executable, linkage fails since there are two main functions, one in the tested executable and one in the test executable. And Im not aware of any way to create an import library on Linux and to link with it.p  pI understand that I can divide my tested executable into a shared library with all the functionality in it and a small executable with only the main function in it. The test program would link with the shared library. But thats something I would really prefer not doing, since I have more than 20 of these executables that I need to test and dividing each of them into a shared library and an executable would take too long from number of reasons.p  pAnother possibility would be to add the tested source code into the test project, but then the tested source code would be compiled twice, which I cant afford because of long build times.p  pSo Im trying to figure out if it is possible to do on Linux something similar to what Ive done on Windows.p  pThank you in advance.p

Negative 256 pIm trying to create a form that is able to navigate between other forms that will be running in the background upon initializing the parent form one side of the form will contain the buttons, each button leading to a different subform or child form, unlike using nextprevious navigation method. I also want to make it that each window or tab in the main form will be populated with a sub form whose code is written separately from the parent form. Meaning, instead of constructing sub forms inside the parent forms code, Id much prefer to referencecall them to the parent form, each in its respective tab.p  pOperationally speaking, theres a main form, and buttons on one side, and an empty space on the other, that presents sub forms depending on what button you clicked. and those sub forms run in the background already populated as the form initializes. For example, I click Item Management the empty space will show me an already populated ItemFrm. I make a few changes in my item database, confirm them, and proceed to look at my transfers. If I click Transfers the ItemFrm will switch to, lets say, TransFrm. If I want to go back to ItemFrm after Im done with Transfers, it will go back to ItemFrm exactly as I left it. p  pI tried lurking here for a while now, tried using things like TabControl and MDI but I seem to lack the expertise to solve this particular problem. Ive tried making a sub form appear exclusively in the TabControl TabPage, but what happened is that it spawned at the edge of the MDI parent form. I seem to be lost.p  pAny and all help will be appreciatedp

Negative 256 pA need to implement a functionality for addingremoving users and groups on Linux system. I use these POSIX callsp  ul livoid setgrentvoid  for opening group file li listruct group getgrentvoid  for reading group structure li livoid endgrentvoid  for closing fileli ul  pThe idea is to read all user and group structures in a vector, modify them, and then rewrite existing etcpasswd and etcgroup files.

Negative 256 pPlease excuse me if you find this question a bit silly.But I am quite new to MVC.p  pAs far as I know that the actions are designed to work stateless.

Therefore I have created a AddArtistToObject action in ObjectController as belowp  precodepublic ActionResult AddArtistToObjectint ObjectID, int ArtistID    code goes here    codepre  pSo the popup menu opens up and there is a search area to search for artist. you get the list of artist matching.

Negative 256 pstrongSolvedstrongp  pIm working on a 2D procedural island generator. So far Ive used several noise functions and blending to achieve the desired island shapes but currently they are only 300 x 200 pixels in size. What I want to do is scale the image data strongNOT THE IMAGEstrong up to the desired map size of somewhere in the range of 400,000 x 400,000. I considered simply changing the noise functions to a lower frequency resulting in a larger island but Im also blending them with a generated gradient that is already computationally heavy. Increasing the size of my generated gradient would hurt the generation time greatly.p  pMy island shapeimage a hrefhttp4.bp.blogspot.comed7nK7jwcJcUxYjNMxUFIAAAAAAAAAScsGBygA4usAs1600PopulationMap1.png relnofollowhttp4.bp.blogspot.comed7nK7jwcJcUxYjNMxUFIAAAAAAAAAScsGBygA4usAs1600PopulationMap1.pngap  pThe data behind the island is an array of floats ranging from 0  1 that represent the waterbeachland. All I need is to scale strongTHATstrong data to the range I need for continuing with the generation of roads and so on. Basically each pixel is a tile, and I need somewhere around 400k in width from the current 300 in width. I realize that there is probably too little input data to scale it that high but I would still like to attempt it.p  pIve read up on all the image filtering and interpolating methods but I cant get a grasp on any of them. I noticed this question already asked a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9668821arrayinterpolationArray interpolationa but I cant understand how to get it working on a grid larger than 4x4, but the OP describes exactly what Im looking for.p  pBasically linear or bicubic filteringscaling on a large grid of float value. I just need some example code to outline the process..p  pIf all else fails Ill switch my gradient to a more simple approach and just generate the entirety of the map data at the size I want it to begin with. But I really would like to try scaling it. Thanks in advance.p  pstrongEDIT strong  Ive gotten to the point where I have a list of weighted value pairs for each tile surrounding the point Im querying at. So If I was querying for the value at 5.5, 5.5 I would get the value and weight of the tiles surrounding and including 5,5. So I have a list of 9 0.9, 1.27  0.3, 0.77 etc. value pairs where the first is the element in the array and the second is its weight inverse of the distance between it and the queried point. Now Im struggling with a way to add all these weighted value pairs together to reach a final value. Im pretty sure it has to do with some sort of interpolation but I cant quite grasp the way to do it. If I can get past this part then I should be good with the rest.p

Ive added some extra info in the code Here is my highscore classp  precode    public class Highscore   An arraylist of the type score we will use to work with the scores inside the class private ArrayListltScoregt scores   The name of the file where the highscores will be saved private static final String highscorefile  Resourcesscores.dat  Initialising an in and outputStream for working with the file ObjectOutputStream output  null ObjectInputStream input  null  public Highscore      initialising the scoresarraylist     scores  new ArrayListltScoregt  public ArrayListltScoregt getScores      loadScoreFile     sort     return scores  private void sort      ScoreVergelijken comparator  new ScoreVergelijken     Collections.sortscores, comparator  public void addScoreString name, int score      loadScoreFile     scores.addnew Scorename, score     updateScoreFile  public void loadScoreFile      try          input  new ObjectInputStreamnew FileInputStreamhighscorefile         scores  ArrayListltScoregt input.readObject      catch FileNotFoundException e          System.out.println[Laad] FNF Error   e.getMessage      catch IOException e          System.out.println[Laad] IO Error   e.getMessage      catch ClassNotFoundException e          System.out.println[Laad] CNF Error   e.getMessage      finally          try              if output  null                  output.flush                 output.close                       catch IOException e              System.out.println[Laad] IO Error   e.getMessage                public void updateScoreFile      try          output  new ObjectOutputStreamnew FileOutputStreamhighscorefile         output.writeObjectscores      catch FileNotFoundException e          System.out.println[Update] FNF Error   e.getMessage  ,the program will try and make a new file      catch IOException e          System.out.println[Update] IO Error   e.getMessage      finally          try              if output  null                  output.flush                 output.close                       catch IOException e              System.out.println[Update] Error   e.getMessage                public String getHighscoreString      String highscoreString          int max  10      ArrayListltScoregt scores     scores  getScores      int i  0     int x  scores.size     if x gt max          x  max          while i lt x          highscoreString  i  1  .t  scores.geti.getNaam  tt  scores.geti.getScore  n         i          return highscoreString  codepre  pp  pHere is my Main class    p  precode    public class Main      public static void mainString[] args      Highscore hm  new Highscore     hm.addScoreBart,240     hm.addScoreMarge,300     hm.addScoreMaggie,220     hm.addScoreHomer,100     hm.addScoreLisa,270     hm.addScoreLabyrinthProject.View.MainMenu.username,290      System.out.printhm.getHighscoreString   codepre  pScore class p  precodepublic class Score  implements Serializable  private int score private String naam  public Score     public int getScore      return score   public String getNaam      return naam   public ScoreString naam, int score      this.score  score     this.naam  naam  codepre  pp  pScoreVergelijken class which means CompareScorep  precodepublic class ScoreVergelijken implements ComparatorltScoregt  public int compareScore score1, Score score2       int sc1  score1.getScore     int sc2  score2.getScore      if sc1 gt sc2         return 1                    1 means first score is bigger then second score     else if sc1 lt sc2         return 1                    1 means that score is lower     else         return 0                      0 means score is equal          codepre  pIf anyone could explain to me what to use, it would be greatly appreciated Thank you very muchp  pAlso, how to use those highscores and store them encrypted in a text file.

I can chmod this files and the errors will all go away.... until the cron job runs again.p  pI checked around the web a bit and found one post suggesting that I add this to my core.phpp  precodeCacheconfigdefault, array engine gt File, mask gt 0666,   codepre  pI didnt have any effect.  I would really appreciate some advice on how to get the owner of these tmp files to stop changing or how to make cakephp not throw up an error about it.p  pThanks a lotp

Im just wondering what the Angular way of making configurable modules is. Obviously I dont want to have to modify my reusable JS file for each website, as that kind of defeats the purpose of having it.

Negative 256 pSo Ive put a UITextView in a UITableView for the separators and to make it so I dont have to do a bunch of resizing based on the size of the screen and what not. The only problem is that when the user taps on the text view, it scrolls the tableview so that the lowest line with no text is at the top. If there is anything inside it, it scrolls right past it. I havent found any documentation on why this happens or how to stop it. If anyone could provide any input or tips, that would be appreciated. Thanks.p

Negative 256 pI am using the Eclipse Android IDE, downloaded from the Android site ADT v22.6.2, Mac, OS X.  p  pWhen I first launch the program, it is quick to open new files and make modifications, but very rapidly slows down and becomes quite laggy.  Opening project files becomes so slow that one wonders if the IDE crashed or frozeup.  Editing said project files is equally painful...  p  pFor example, clicking into a nonfucused windowtab to insert the cursor takes a solid 510 seconds or more of delay before it appears and modifications can be made, and saving files can take up to 10 seconds or more for a single file.p  pstrongWhy is thisstrong  Why does it start off nice and quick, but so rapidly degrade in performance  Restarting ADT will bring the speed up a bit, but each successive launch of it brings the overall performance down to the point where only restarting the computer can bring it back up.p  pIve had similar issues back when I was coding in MatLab and using their WYSIWYG GUI builder.  Eventually the system got bogged down with all the components being drawn on the screen that it would freeze up and youd have to restart the software and sometimes the computer.p  pEclipse is very powerful, and Id be lost without it, but it would be nice to maintain consistent performance from it without multiple software and system restarts.

Negative 256 pI have written an extensive python package that utilizes excel and pywin32. I am now in the progress of moving this package to a linux environment on a Vagrant machine.p  pI know there are emulatoresque software packages e.g. WINE that can run Windows applications and lookalikes for some Windows applications e.g. Excel to OpenOffice. However, I am not seeing the right path to take in order to get my pywin32Excel dependent code written for Windows running in a Linux environment on a Vagrant machine.  Ideally, I would not have to alter my code at all and just do the appropriate installs on my Vagrant machine.p  pThanksp
Negative 256 pI would like to have a custom thread pool satisfying the following requirementsp  ol liReal threads are preallocated according to the pool capacity. The actual work is free to use the standard .NET thread pool, if needed to spawn concurrent tasks.li liThe pool must be able to return the number of idle threads. The returned number may be less than the actual number of the idle threads, but it must not be greater. Of course, the more accurate the number the better.li liQueuing work to the pool should return a corresponding codeTaskcode, which should place nice with the Task based API.li listrongNEWstrong The max job capacity or degree of parallelism should be adjustable dynamically. Trying to reduce the capacity does not have to take effect immediately, but increasing it should do so immediately.li ol  pThe rationale for the first item is depicted belowp  ul liThe machine is not supposed to be running more than N work items concurrently, where N is relatively small  between 10 and 30.li liThe work is fetched from the database and if K items are fetched then we want to make sure that there are K idle threads to start the work right away. A situation where work is fetched from the database, but remains waiting for the next available thread is unacceptable.li ul  pThe last item also explains the reason for having the idle thread count  I am going to fetch that many work items from the database. It also explains why the reported idle thread count must never be higher than the actual one  otherwise I might fetch more work that can be immediately started.p  pAnyway, here is my implementation along with a small program to test it BJE stands for Background Job Enginep  precodeusing System using System.Collections.Concurrent using System.Collections.Generic using System.Diagnostics using System.Threading using System.Threading.Tasks  namespace TaskStartLatency      public class BJEThreadPool              private sealed class InternalTaskScheduler  TaskScheduler                      private int midleThreadCount             private readonly BlockingCollectionltTaskgt mbus              public InternalTaskSchedulerint threadCount, BlockingCollectionltTaskgt bus                              midleThreadCount  threadCount                 mbus  bus                           public void RunInlineTask task                              Interlocked.Decrementref midleThreadCount                 try                                      TryExecuteTasktask                                  catch                                       The action is responsible itself for the error handling, for the time being...

be working. However, there is a problem  the codeBJEThreadPool.Runcode method does not accept asynchronous methods. I.e. my implementation does not allow me to add the following overloadsp  precodepublic Task RunFuncltCancellationToken, Taskgt action      return Task.Factory.StartNew gt actionmcts.Token, mcts.Token, TaskCreationOptions.DenyChildAttach, mts.Unwrap  public Task RunFuncltTaskgt action      return Task.Factory.StartNewaction, mcts.Token, TaskCreationOptions.DenyChildAttach, mts.Unwrap  codepre  pThe pattern I use in codeInternalTaskScheduler.RunInlinecode does not work in this case.p  pSo, my question is how to add the support for asynchronous work items I am fine with changing the entire design as long as the requirements outlined at the beginning of the post are upheld.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI would like to clarify the intented usage of the desired pool. Please, observe the following codep  precodeif pool.IdleThreadCount  0    return   foreach var jobData in FetchFromDBpool.IdleThreadCount    pool.RunCreateJobActionjobData  codepre  pNotesp  ol liThe code is going to be run periodically, say every 1 minute.li liThe code is going to be run concurrently by multiple machines watching the same database.li licodeFetchFromDBcode is going to use the technique described in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3641703usingsqlserverasadbqueuewithmultipleclientsUsing SQL Server as a DB queue with multiple clientsa to atomically fetch and lock the work from the DB.li licodeCreateJobActioncode is going to invoke the code denoted by codejobDatacode strongthe job codestrong and close the work upon the completion of that code. The job code is out of my control and it could be pretty much anything  heavy CPU bound code or light asynchronous IO bound code, badly written synchronous IO bound code or a mix of all. It could run for minutes and it could run for hours. Closing the work is my code and it would by asynchronous IO bound code. Because of this, the signature of the returned job action is that of an asynchronous method.li ol  pItem 2 underlines the importance of correctly identifying the amount of idle threads. If there are 900 pending work items and 10 agent machines I cannot allow an agent to fetch 300 work items and queue them on the thread pool. Why Because, it is most unlikely that the agent will be able to run 300 work items concurrently. It will run some, sure enough, but others will be waiting in the thread pool work queue. Suppose it will run 100 and let 200 wait even though 100 is probably far fetched. This wields 3 fully loaded agents and 7 idle ones. But only 300 work items out of 900 are actually being processed concurrently p  pMy goal is to maximize the spread of the work amongst the available agents. Ideally, I should evaluate the load of an agent and the heaviness of the pending work, but it is a formidable task and is reserved for the future versions. Right now, I wish to assign each agent the max job capacity with the intention to provide the means to increasedecrease it dynamically without restarting the agents.p  pNext observation. The work can take quite a long time to run and it could be all synchronous code. As far as I understand it is undesirable to utilize thread pool threads for such kind of work.p  pstrongEDIT 2strongp  pThere is a statement that codeTaskSchedulercode is only for the CPU bound work. But what if I do not know the nature of the work I mean it is a general purpose Background Job Engine and it runs thousands of different kinds of jobs. I do not have means to tell that job is CPU bound and that on is synchronous IO bound and yet another one is asynchronous IO bound. I wish I could, but I cannot. p  pstrongEDIT 3strongp  pAt the end, I do not use the codeSemaphoreSlimcode, but neither do I use the codeTaskSchedulercode  it finally trickled down my thick skull that it is unappropriate and plain wrong, plus it makes the code overly complex.p  pStill, I failed to see how codeSemaphoreSlimcode is the way. The proposed patternp  precodepublic async Task EnqueueFuncltTaskgt taskGenerator      await semaphore.WaitAsync     try              await taskGenerator          finally              semaphore.Release       codepre  pExpects taskGenerator either be an asynchronous IO bound code or open a new thread otherwise. However, I have no means to determine whether the work to be executed is one or another. Plus, as I have learned from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions25654498semaphoreslimwaitasynccontinuationcodeSemaphoreSlim.WaitAsync continuation codea if the semaphore is unlocked, the code following the WaitAsync is going to run on the same thread, which is not very good for me.p  pAnyway, below is my implementation, in case anyone fancies. Unfortunately, I am yet to understand how to reduce the pool thread count dynamically, but this is a topic for another question.p  precodeusing System using System.Collections.Concurrent using

Negative 256 pI have a question regarding python scripting in Blender, and Id really appreciate it if someone could give me at least some conceptual guidelines to how I could do thisp  pBasically I have around 100 planes simple primitive planes and each of them has its own material and each material has its own transparency map applied to it.p  pI need a way to snap each of those planes respective pivots to their opaque parts. I.e. if there is a way to tell the following to blender through python language  hey, go over every one of these planes, and do the following for each  snap a 3D cursor to an opaque part of the plane it doesnt matter where exactly, as long as its inside of an opaque part of the plane and then snap planes pivot point to the 3D cursor.p  pOf course I dont expect anyone to write me a full algorithm for this, I am just asking for a little help and a push in the right direction, as I do have experience with python, but not with blender p  pAny help would be appreciated.p

Negative 256 pVirtual pages are mapped to physical pages in the VM mechanism. The physical pages are evicted once a new page must be paged in.br I always assumed that the pageinpageout was either to the swap area or the file region that has been actually mapped to the VM.br I have read that Linux on start up maps all the physical pages to virtual pages and that is why the monitoring tools show much memory kept by the kernel I guess.br So my question is, what is the benefit of this approach A virtual page does not physically exist on disk until a physical page has been evicted and the costly part is to page in and out a page and this is not avoided. Additionally it seems to me it is more complicated to passing all these pages originally reserved for the kernel to the various processes that request them.br What am I misunderstanding herep

Negative 256 pIt is clear that one cannot parametrize a method with abstract type members.

Negative 256 pThis is just bizarre. Yesterday I was debugging a classic asp page in Visual Studio 2008 Ive been working on for about a week. While Im debugging the code seems to stop hitting breakpoints. The page isnt responding at all. I figured there might be a recursive loop in my code so I make some minor changes and try to save before running again. Instead of saving like normal it brings up the save dialog box asking me where I want to save it. I choose the location it should already be in. It does the usual this file already exists would you like to overwrite. I click ok. Im then told that access is denied. I right click the file in windows explorer and navigate to its security settings. Under current owner it reads Unable to display current owner. I then try right clicking and editing in Notepad. It tells me The file does not exist, would you like to create it Visual Studio cant find the file. My version control has the file as checked out but cant locate it. I can see the file in windows explorer until I do an IIS reset. Then it disappears. I then check my Recycle Bin. Its not in there. The file just vanished. After searching for hours and finding nothing remotely close to the subject I decided to get the file again from my source control and start over. After debugging several times IT HAPPENS AGAIN. The file keeps disappearing What is going onp  pEdit I think Ive figured out that this is only happening when I forget to call the MoveNext function on my ADODB.RecordSet when Im transferring the data from the record set to several arrays.p  pThe file seems to vanish when this code is calledp  precodedim myList do while not oRS.EOF             redim preserve myListstatusCount     myListstatusCount  oRS.Fields0 loop codepre  pBut not when this is calledp  precodedim myList do while not oRS.EOF             redim preserve myListstatusCount     myListstatusCount  oRS.Fields0     oRS.MoveNext loop codepre  pMakes since why the code would break.

Negative 256 pAs described here a hrefhttpsflume.apache.orgFlumeDeveloperGuide.html relnofollowhttpsflume.apache.orgFlumeDeveloperGuide.htmlap  pWhen creating Flume components such as sources, its common to extend AbstractSource that spawn a threadexecutor that will run your polling for new events. Putting these events on the defined channel is also quite easy using ChannelProcessor.processEvent.p  pAt any time, this sources stop method may be called, and typically you would terminate the executor. However, assuming that your Flume source is now blocking either in polling events e.g. lets say waiting for a line from BufferedReader or blocking when putting an event on the channel. What is the common way to deal with the errors that might emerge from these two blocking operations as a result of the sysadmin shutting down the executorthreadRunnable And how do you distinguish these from the other exceptions that may be thrown as a result of other issues p

Negative 256 pI am working on a audio real time application and I would like to imrpove the performance of it. I actually already posted a topic but this is about stdthread specificly.p  pThe audio processing ist mostly done by two seperate objects  codeleftProcessorcode track and coderightProcessorcode. Since these objects dont rely on each other, using two threads to process them should realy improve the performance with multi core CPUs. However, I currently get the opposite result. p  pBefore I activated the compiler performance optimization O2, using two threads got me about 50 more performance, but after I switched the optimization on, I got 1020 less performance, while the performance got drasticly better for both versions.p  pI measure the performance by taking the time at two points within the function and bruteforce printing the result to the screen so there could be some problems with this. p  pMy guess would be that creating a codestdthreadcode would take more time than I actually gain from running the processing on the second thread.  In this case, is it possible to improve the performance by using the same thread for every function call and just passing the thread the new arguments I dont realy know if this is possible.p  pThe function currently takes about 0.0005ms to 0.002ms to process.p  pHere is the codep  pre classlangcpp prettyprintoverridecodevoid AudioControllerprocessAudioint frameCount, float output   ifdef AUDIOCONTROLLERMULTITHREADING      CALCULATE RIGHT TRACK     stdthread rightProcessorThread     ifrightLoaded          rightProcessorThread  stdthreadampAudioProcessortick,  function                                            rightProcessor,         object                                            rightFrameBuffer,       arg1                                            frameCount            arg2      else          forint i  0 i lt frameCount i              rightFrameBuffer[i].leftSample   0.0f             rightFrameBuffer[i].rightSample  0.0f                else      CALCULATE RIGHT TRACK     ifrightLoaded          rightProcessorgttickrightFrameBuffer, frameCount           else          forint i  0 i lt frameCount i              rightFrameBuffer[i].leftSample   0.0f             rightFrameBuffer[i].rightSample  0.0f                endif       CALCULATE LEFT TRACK     Frame  leftFrameBuffer  Frame output      ifleftLoaded          leftProcessorgttickleftFrameBuffer, frameCount             else          forint i  0 i lt frameCount i              leftFrameBuffer[i].leftSample   0.0f             leftFrameBuffer[i].rightSample  0.0f                ifdef AUDIOCONTROLLERMULTITHREADING      CALCULATE RIGHT TRACK     ifrightLoaded          rightProcessorThread.join      endif       MIX     forint i  0 i lt frameCount i           leftFrameBuffer[i]  volume  leftRightMix  leftFrameBuffer[i]  1.0  leftRightMix  rightFrameBuffer[i]        codepre

Negative 256 pI have to call a method from an external library. I have no control over it and it blocks the UI for 5 secounds. It is just one method. Because I really like asyncawait, my code looks like thatp  precodeSoundSource  await Task.Run gt CodecFactory.Instance.GetCodecPath codepre  pThe problem is that it can last about 30 secounds and the user wants to cancel it. My first thought Set in the codeGetAwaiter.OnCompletedcode an AutoResetEvent and run a codewhilecode which waits 500 ms for the AutoResetEvent and than checks, if a bool variable codecancelLoadingcode is truep  precode            using var waithandler  new AutoResetEventfalse                              var x  track.GetSoundSource                 x.GetAwaiter.OnCompleted gt  waithandler.Set                  while x.IsCompleted                                      await Task.Run gt waithandler.WaitOne500                     if cancelLoading                                              x.GetAwaiter.OnCompleted gt x.Result.Dispose                         isLoadingSoundSource  false                         cancelLoading  false                         return                                                       isLoadingSoundSource  false                 SoundSource  x.Result              codepre  pBut that is not a good solution because it doesnt know if it can set codeisLoadingSoundSourcecode to true because the new method could be still running the procedure. It could be fixed with another, global AutoResetEvent, but thats really complicated and can end in easily end in a dead look.p  pIs there a good way to cancel the methodTask i dont have to use tasks if they dont support that. I dont need to abort it, it would be nice if it can run until it ends and than just dispose the result.p
Negative 256 pThe problem we encountered with our trunk is at one point someone was moving files and deleted a top level directory, committed that change then restored the directory and committed that change.p  pFrom the outside we thought that was fine... until other branches synced from trunk. Now this meant that when syncing the branch SVN would delete that top level directory and then just readd the trunks state of that dir... causing all changes in that dir to be lost on the branch ouch.p  pHence the need for a way to rewind the SVN head.p  pOur only thought was to make a branch from the previous commit and try to make that trunk but that seems like it may lead to some issues like tree conflicts.p

Negative 256 pIm often working on very large web applications that use springmvc and I find that it becomes increasingly difficult to organize my URL endpoints in a way that keeps them refactorable. By convention, my controllers might look like thisp  precodeController RequestMappingvalue  ProtocolController.ROOTMAPPING public class ProtocolController extends BaseController       public static final String ROOTMAPPING  protocol      RequestMappingvaluemanagement, method  RequestMethod.GET     public ModelAndView management         ...       codepre  pI might have a view somewhere else in the application that has a link back to the management page so that view has to build the URL. In my view I can access the context path via the model context path was injected into model by codeBaseControllercode, I can access the next segment of the URL via codeProtocolController.ROOTMAPPINGcode but then the last part of the URL is just a regular ol String. My choice of view technology is a custom inhouse solution that involves writing raw Java to generate HTMLp  precodeString url  model.getcontextPath  ProtocolController.ROOTMAPPING  management codepre  pThe problem is that if I ever change the management endpoint, I cant find all the places in my code that reference it. I suppose I could replace the string literal with a codestatic finalcode String just like I do with codeROOTMAPPINGcode but is there a cleaner way Are there any known design patterns for organizingreferencing endpointsp

Negative 256 pSince I have very little experience in issues like timing, I would like to ask you guys before taking my next step.br I am currently writing a game engine with SDL and use the function codeSDLGetTickscode to calculate my deltaTime in the GameLoop.br Since I need a timer functionality for controlling the lifetime of assets I want to remove the asset from the cache, when it hasnt been used for a specific amount of time I looked for some ways to implement one.br I found the codeltchronogtcode header suitable for that task, but remembered that I already use codeSDLGetTickscode internally for my deltaTime.  p  pFor me it sounds like using two different timers could cause some problems.br Is there anything I should watch out for, or simply just stick with codeSDLGetTickscode for all timing issuesp  pP.S I apologize if this belongs in the Game Development section, but I thought its kind of a general questionp
Negative 256 pWhen you open the game, you click Go in the tutorial, then an image appears. When one swipes this image, if it does not go to the game over screen, the image should fly off the screen.

However, instead, the time bar at the top, as well as the background, are flying off screen, while that image is not.

Negative 256 pPlease help  does flaskwtforms somehow treat the data property of a field differently after an appendentry call or am I just really doing this wrongp  pI have a form that gets its data from a yaml file.  On the initial GET request, the form populates showing the icons from the code if ifc.poe.data code as expected.  If either button is hit to add a module or interface, the POST rerenders the page, but now ifc.poe.data is empty and thus no icons are rendered.  If you comment out the codeif ifc.xxx.datacode portion and uncomment out the actual fields, the fields are rendered with the proper data every time.

Negative 256 pIve been at this for a while now and just can figure it out... I have a pullup in my app. This pullup has a header that you can click or drag to open it. Inside the pullup is a fragment with a ListView with some clickable items. The pullup is usually partially displayed to show the first 1 or 2 items.p  pThis works fine and well, I can make the ListView nonscrollable when its partially displayed by changing how many items the adapter supplies to the ListView although this is kind of hackish and id like to find a better way. However, i ran into problems, when i wanted to make the entire pullup draggable.p  pSo, if you click on an item, it should send a click event to that item. But if you drag in the area of the ListView, it should send that to the pullup so you can drag it around, the same way you would if youd drag on the header of the pullup.p  pAny ideas how i could achieve this I tried putting the ListView inside a FrameLayout and using onInterceptTouchEvent but I couldnt get it to work...p

Negative 256 pI have an Apache Spark batch job running continuously on AWS EMR.

Negative 256 pFrom what I have read online, any dynamically created views should be saved when the android screen is rotated as long as those views are given an arbitrary id.p  pI am running into a problem, however, where any dynamically created table row that is created is deleted when the screen changes orientation from portrait to landscape or vice versa.p  pI have a TableLayout defined in my main activitys fragment which is modified after an activity where the user defines the data for a new table row finishes.p  pSo far that part works fine.p  pThe table stores an item and a corresponding location. itemInsertResponse is called by onActivityResult, which appends the new row returned by createItemRow to the existing table.p  precodepublic void itemInsertResponseIntent data      String item  data.getStringExtraitem     String location  data.getStringExtralocation      TableLayout itemCatalog  TableLayout findViewByIdR.id.tblcatalog     itemCatalog.addViewcreateItemRowitem, location, new TableLayout.LayoutParamsTableLayout.LayoutParams.MATCHPARENT, TableLayout.LayoutParams.MATCHPARENT     public TableRow createItemRowString item, String location      TableRow itemRow  new TableRowthis     itemRow.setLayoutParamsnew TableLayout.LayoutParamsTableLayout.LayoutParams.MATCHPARENT, TableLayout.LayoutParams.MATCHPARENT     TextView itemText  new TextViewthis     TextView locationText  new TextViewthis     itemText.setTextitem     itemText.setId3     locationText.setId4      locationText.setTextlocation      itemRow.addViewitemText     itemRow.addViewlocationText       setPadding appears to take values in px, need to conver to dp     int paddingindp  5   6 dps     final float scale  getResources.getDisplayMetrics.density     int paddinginpx  int paddingindp  scale  0.5f     itemRow.setPaddingpaddinginpx, paddinginpx, paddinginpx, paddinginpx     itemRow.setId9001      return itemRow   codepre  pI set id values for the table row and the text views which, from what I have read, should mean that the default implementation of OnSavedInstanceState saves them.p  pIs this some kind of bug, or do I actually need to manually save the newly created rows in OnSavedInstanceState in order to maintain the state of the table  If I do need to override that method, how do I save every dynamically created row  p  pThe best solution I can think of is to store a global ArrayList of arrays containing the two strings for each row and then recreate every row in OnCreate using that ArrayListbut thats clearly very inefficient.p

Negative 256 pI have recently switched to emVIMem using emNERDTreeem and empythonmodeem.

Negative 256 pAfter googling it doesnt look promising, but Im wondering if there is some way of aliasing or typedefing when using codeActionltTgtcode or codeFuncltin T, out TResultgtcode in Cp  pIve already seen a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq1614771548472Equivalent of typedef in ca, which says that within one compile scope you can use the codeusingcode construct for some cases, but that doesnt seem to apply to codeActioncodes and codeFunccodes as far as I can tell.p  pThe reason I want to do this is that I want an action to be used as a parameter to several functions, and if I, at some point in time, decide to change the action its a lot of places to change both as parameter types and as variable types.p  precodetypedef MyAction  Actionltint, intgt  public static SomeFuncWindowClass window, int number, MyAction callbackAction     ...    SomeOtherFunccallbackAction    ...

Negative 256 pI am trying to set validation on an input field using AngularJS directive, so that when the user types invalid value, the underlying model value changes to the last valid one. This is the contents of the directivep  precode       returns truefalse       function validateValuevalue                 ngModelCtrl.parsers.pushvalidateValue       ngModelCtrl.formatters.pushvalidateValue        scope.watchattrs.checkValidName, function              ngModelCtrl.setViewValuengModelCtrl.viewValue        codepre  pSo from my understanding, this code will basically run codevalidateValuecode callback on every change of the input value and mark the input field with validinvalid depending of the return value. This works great for basic validation, but the side effect of this in case the value is invalid, model value wont contain anything.  Im not sure how to change the code, so that when the value is invalid, the modal value actually contains the last valid value p

Negative 256 pSo I seem to have spent the last couple of days trying to find various solutions for this and have decided its probably best that I just ask someone. Im using a storyboard and I send an array from one ViewController to another just fine. But once in this SecondViewController im having an issue with it. I would then like to be able to access the array in a subview of this view controller to be able to draw a graph with the data but whenever I try I just always get null from the code in the subview even though its definitely in the ParentViewController. Could someone please have a look at my current code and let me know how I would get this data in my subview.p  pstrongParentViewController.hstrongp  precodeimport ltUIKitUIKit.hgt import GraphView.h import Model.h interface GraphViewController  UIViewController  property strong Model model  property weak GraphView graph  property strong NSArray data end codepre  pstrongParentViewController.mstrongp  precodeimport GraphViewController.h  interface GraphViewController   end  implementation GraphViewController synthesize graph  voidviewDidLoad     [super viewDidLoad]     Do any additional setup after loading the view.

Negative 256 pI have created a custom annotation codeJsonSchemacode where I have implemented the functionality of codeRequestBodycode. My annotation will always be used to read JSON from a web request. But I want to validate the JSON against a schema before letting it be passed further. For that I have a class that implements codeHandlerMethodArgumentResolvercodep  pInitially, my annotation was used only with a codeStringcode, so it was easy for me to get the generic object from codeRequestResponseBodyMethodProcessorresolveArgumentcode, cast it to a string, validate it and then return it. But now I want to use my annotation with custom classes too. p  pSo what I want to understand is how does codeRequestBodycode cast the bind the JSON in the body of web request to compatible class. If I understand how that is happening, I can first extract the body as a string, do my validation and then bind the body to whatever class that has my annotation and return it.p  pMy current implementation of coderesolveArgumentcodep  precodeOverride public Object resolveArgumentMethodParameter parameter,         ModelAndViewContainer mavContainer, NativeWebRequest webRequest,         WebDataBinderFactory binderFactory throws Exception      Object value   getRequestResponseBodyMethodProcessor             .resolveArgumentparameter, mavContainer, webRequest, binderFactory     return value       return validateJsonvalue, parameter I need to pass a String here     Using message converters to read from body of web request.

Negative 256 pRecently due to project requirements, Im evaluating springs websocket module. To my surprise it has very few online tutorial for beginner to write a simple websocket application.

Then repeat for each paragraph.  I have tried just applying one span and also one div at the top of the three paragraphs and then closing it at the end of the third paragraph but it goes wrong.
