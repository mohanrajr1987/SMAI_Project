Positive 5117 pmy app shall connect to a Bluetooth LE device. Usually you perform a device scan using codemBluetoothAdapter.startLeScanmLeScanCallbackcode. The callback provides you information about available devices. p  pIf you want to connect to a dedicated device, you do something like p  precodeBluetoothDevice device  mBluetoothAdapter.getRemoteDeviceaddress codepre  pand thenp  precodemBluetoothGatt  device.connectGattthis, false, mGattCallback codepre  pTo me it looks like the only thing you need to connect to a BLE device, is to know the BLE address and then connect to it with the above two steps. So if I know a BLE address already e.g. it is written on the label of the BLE device I dont need to perform a BLE scan.p  pBut what I have encountered is, that if I have a BLE device which I have never found through a BLE scan before, it is not possible to connect to it directly in using its BLE address. I have to find it through a scan at least one time with my android phone. Afterwards I never need a scan again and I can connect to the BLE device just by using its BLE address.p  pIs it supposed to be like this or did I oversee somethingp  pThanks a lot, Stefanp
Positive 5117 pI have a simple Fragment within my Activity in which I enable and disable Bluetooth adapter and I want to listen to Bluetooth Adapter state changes with a BroadcastReceiver from within the Fragment.

Positive 5117 pI am currently working on a project where im building an app that uses Bluetooth to send commands to my Arduino Uno and everything is working perfectly except for the actual sending of data.p  pWhenever I try to send data it throws a Null Pointer Exception and what I know of these exceptions is that they are thrown when something wasnt initialized or cannot be found Correct me if im wrong. So I think the problem is that my connectedThread wasnt properly initialized but I dont know where to do this and what to do.p  pThere is some other code there for speechtotext so just ignore that.p

Positive 5117 pIm working on university project that consists in audio speaker with bluetooth connected to mobile application.p  pI search a lot possibilities and bluetooth modules that comply my needs, but I have not found any module. I need a Bluetooth module that can receive audio and work in iOS and Android, but I see that a lot of modules with Classic Bluetooth lowe than 3.0 do not work with iOS, but 3.0 and 4.0 version works with both but are not oriented in audio.p  pIm looking for if someone can help me finding one kit with audio receive bluetooth for all plataforms intended for speaker and cheap. Or separately one bluetooth module receiver with 3.0 or upper version because works in iOS, intended for audio streaming to an speaker, and with some UART pins txrx for example that can simplify the connection with a microcontroller. And one basic microcontroller oriented to bluetooth receives with some bluetooth libraries or simply to program with upplevel language. This microcontroller just receive the audio bits and send it to the speaker.p  pI read too that Smart Bluetooth or Bluetooth Low Energy works on iOS, but cant send audio, have small rate, but i think Smart Ready Bluetooth its possible, but not sure, I have just seen that supports Classic Bluetooth oriented to audio and Bluetooth Low Energy, its possible sens audio with itp  pIn short, Im looking for one module Bluetooth 3.o or 4.0  EDR that can send audio for iOS and Android. I find HC05, CC2506X, or HC06 module, but I have read not works in iOS. And a basic microcontroller simply to program to receive this bluetooth audio to send in a speaker.p  pIf someone know one basic kit, or useful information for me I would appreciate. Thanks.p
Positive 5117 pFor a project I need to get some data from a Bluetooth device on windows 10 using C. Im not too familiar with the Bluetooth API and cant figure out why the following is not working p  pUsing the codeBluetoothLEAdvertisementWatchercode I search for advertisements, which works fine. I do receive the advertisement from the device local name fits as well as its codeServiceUuidscode. Next I try to connect to the device using the codeBluetoothAddresscode received together with the advertisementp  precodeprivate async void OnAdvertisementReceivedBluetoothLEAdvertisementWatcher watcher,                      BluetoothLEAdvertisementReceivedEventArgs eventArgs      ulong blAdress  eventArgs.BluetoothAddress     BluetoothLEDevice blDevice  await           Windows.Devices.Bluetooth.BluetoothLEDevice.FromBluetoothAddressAsyncblAdress  codepre  pHowever, doing so results in an exception p  blockquote   pElement not found. Exception from HRESULT 0x80070490.p blockquote  pIs this the correct way to read data from the device Are other options available to read the data from the services Manually pairing the device in windows is not really an option and also seems to fail.p  pEdit 1 I check for the local name of the device to make sure I only try to connect to the right one. So I guess there is a problem with connecting to this specific device, still I have no idea how to work around that. The service data was succesfully read on iOS, so it should be possible.p
Positive 5117 pIm writing an app using Swift on Xcode that connects to a bluetooth BLE peripheral. Ive established a connection to a the device, and want to read some data from a specific characteristic specifically FFF1 in service UUID FFF0.p  pIm able to request a read of characteristics using the following code if the characteristic that I want to find info for is codecharacteristicxcodep  precodeperipheral.readValueForCharacteristiccharactericsx codepre  pWhat I want to know is this How do I check that this read value is what Im looking for. I want to be able to do an if statement to check my value against the discovered value for that characteristic. p  pEg If discovered value is X then do something, else if discovered value is Y then do something else.p  pThats not a very good explanation of what I want to do, but I hope you get the gist. p  pAnyone know how to go about doing thisp
Positive 5117 pI would like to use a chrome extension to fetch some data from my phone by bluetooth. And the data being retrieved depends on the DOM of the current web page. I found that Google has some chrome.bluetooth API, which means that Chrome is able to access the computer bluetooth. However, it seems that the API is only for Chrome apps, which is totally different from an extension. I am wondering if there is a ways for a chrome extension to establish a bluetooth connection If not, is there any workaroundp

Positive 5117 pI have an app, that checks a database of mac addresses against the ones the Bluetooth scanner can find currently in its vicinity, and if there is a match it basically just says it found someone. However this only works 1 out of 10 times. It finds devices fine, but the comparing fails, I think it is because of how java runs the code, and I do not know how to do it differently.

Positive 5117 pI have a main c program running on a raspberry pi using mono, and another program that isnt mine, written in c that gets some Bluetooth info. p  pIve looked at a couple of ways of getting the Bluetooth info from the c program to the main c. Turning the c program into a DLL seemed to be the best option. But I cant get it to compile using visual studio cant get all the Linux .h files or on the pi with gcc. p  pDoes anyone have a good method of creating a dll for the pi, or a better way to pass data between programs or a way for mono to access bluetooth functions. As far as I know it cant do this   p
Positive 5117 pIf my understanding is correct, there is a large range of UUIDs assigned in the a hrefhttpswww.bluetooth.orgenusspecificationassignednumbersservicediscovery relnofollowspecificationa  but then theres also a hrefhttpsdeveloper.bluetooth.orggattservicesPagesServicesHome.aspx relnofollowthisa.p  pSince an iBeacons UUID can be customised, wouldnt the UUID conflict with existing codes and create undesirable outcomesp  pIf my understanding is correct, the service UUIDs are at byte 30 and 31 of the BLE packet, which is overlapped by iBeacons UUIDs. Service UUIDs are only 2 bytes so it cant be hard for collision to occur.p

Positive 5117 pCan any simple embedded device RECEIVE files from mobile phones using bluetooth andor wifi at the same time, from multiple phones without needing too much configuring Will it need bluetooth and wifi modules separately or will it come with these in built  I know that we can plug in an USB stick in few devices and turn it into a file server but I need a device to act as more of a RECEIVER rather than server. Any suggestion or even a small discussion of what anyone knows related to this is most welcome. p

This is causing extra power consumption, and for specific reasons, I cant pull at my own rate I need to pull at the rate of the device is publishing.  p  pThe firmware developer created a Windows Application that doesnt have this problem without having a hard coded Read Rate.  So it is On me to find the issue.br Does anyone have any recommendationsp
Positive 5117 pHi Im working with delphi XE5 IDE, and had a demo source code for bluetooth communication. In the demo app everything is working fine, but when I start a blank project, and add all the uses and initialization needed for the bluetooth, my app sudnely  terminates.

Positive 5117 pI am looking for a fitness band which provides direct realtime sensor data over Bluetooth to a mobile Android app. I want to write a health app that tracks the heart rate continuously. Most of the bands I found, does not provide direct access and the sensor data needs to be synchronized over the web.p  pWhile searching I came across the Microsoft Band. Their website a hrefhttpdeveloper.microsoftband.com relnofollowhttpdeveloper.microsoftband.coma says it provides data directly over Bluetooth.

Negative 5117 pSQL to find duplicate entries within a groupp  pI have a small problem and Im not sure what would be the best way to fix it, as I only have limited access to the database Oracle itself.

We need to filter all the entries of these groups.p  pDue to limited access to the database we can not use a temporary table, nor can we add an index to the GROUPID column to make it faster.p  pWe can get the GROUPIDs with this query, but we would need a second query to get the needed datap  precodeselect A.GROUPID from EVENT A group by A.GROUPID having countA.GROUPID ltgt 5 codepre  pOne solution would be a subselectp  precodeselect  from EVENT A where A.GROUPID IN    select B.GROUPID   from EVENT B   group by B.GROUPID   having countB.GROUPID ltgt 5  codepre  pWithout an index on GROUPID and 160k entries, this takes much too long.

However, simply running through each element of the       Collection may provide much worse performance for large       collections.

Negative 5117 pI suspect this is a maths issue rather than a flash one. In a nutshell, I have two cubes that rotate around their common center point. So far so good. Using the appendTranslation and appendRotation matrix functions, Ive managed to get the two cubes to rotate ok. p  pThe problem is the drawing order seems to have little effect on the Z Buffering. Ive managed to Z Buffer correctly and order the cubes in order of depth. However, despite getting the drawing order right, the cueb is only properly occluded half of the time. p  pImagine two cubes on the xaxis plane, either side at equal spacing rotating around the Y axis. At 90 degrees one cube will occlude the other and viceversa at 270 degrees rotation. My problem is that this occurs correctly only at one of these places. It appears to be a sign issue as rotating backwards so 90 and 270 has the same effect only at the opposite places. p  pHere is the relevant codep  pPixelCubeGroup.as  Rotate is called each cyclep  precodefunction rotateObjrotxNumber,rotyNumber,rotzNumbervoid               var iint              fori0 iltpixelVec.length i                  var vVector3D  centerPos                 v  v.subtractpixelVec[i].getPos                                   pixelVec[i].rotateObjrotx,roty,rotz,v                           codepre  pPixelCube.as The things that are drawn and rotatedp  precodefunction rotateObjxrotNumber,yrotNumber,zrotNumber, pivotVector3D           rotate the cube by changing the values in the matrix 3D around a pivot point         m.identity               m.appendTranslationpivot.x,pivot.y, pivot.z         m.appendRotationxrot, Vector3D.XAXIS         m.appendRotationyrot, Vector3D.YAXIS         m.appendRotationzrot, Vector3D.ZAXIS         m.appendTranslationpivot.x,pivot.y,pivot.z     function drawvoid          var renderVVector.ltNumbergt  new Vector.ltNumbergt        currentV  new Vector.ltVector3Dgt       for eachvar vvVector3D in v                apply the matrix to the vertices in v         vv  m.transformVectorvv          vv.w  400  vv.z  400          vv.project           renderV.pushvv.x, vv.y          currentV.pushvv              draw things out      container.graphics.clear      container.x  xPos      container.y  yPos      container.z  1       var id  0       plane.sortsortByZ       for eachvar pVector.ltintgt in plane               container.graphics.beginFillpalleteColours[id],1.0         var planeVVector.ltNumbergt  new Vector.ltNumbergt          for var iint  0 i lt planeSides i                      planeV.pushrenderV[p[i] 2], renderV[p[i]  2  1]                    container.graphics.drawTrianglesplaneV, indices, null, TriangleCulling.NEGATIVE           container.graphics.endFill         id             codepre  pIve managed to narrow it down to the translation lines.

Of course, I, coming from Haskell, am very tempted to define types like I would in Haskell, which would be for virtually everything short of a throwaway tuple, but I dont think it works like that in Clojure world .

Negative 5117 pWhere or how can I find the correct C headers to include in a C program to obtain the declaration of C functions declared in a POSIX compliant environmentp  pIm asking this because I needed to use the codeopencode system call in my C program for my purposes, so I initially tried to include the headers mentioned in the online documentation about codeopencode in the SYNOPSIS section, which are codesysstat.hcode and codefcntl.hcode.  However when trying to compile, the compiler complained that codeopencode was not declared. After a search on google, I found that another possibility was codeunistd.hcode. I tried using that header and the program compiled. So I went back to the POSIX documentation to read more about codeunistd.hcode to check if codeopencode was mentioned there, but I could not find anything about it.p  pstrongWhat am I doing wrong Why is there this discrepancy between the POSIX documentation and my GCC environmentstrongp

Negative 5117 pThis question is for all NoSQL and specially mongoDB experts out there. I started by designing a relational DB for a project but client wants us to use a DB that can easily scale. To achieve this we have decided to use mongoDB. These days I am having trouble mapping my relational model for NoSQL. I have a users table which has a manytomany relation with a lot of other tables as illustrated belowp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comHpIlr.png altrelational DBp  pI have a few options when converting it for mongoDBp  pstrongOption 1 with complete rows in usersstrongp  precodeusers   idltuseridgt,   battles[battle1, battle2, ...],   items[item1, item2, ...],   locations[location1, location2, ...],   units[unit1, unit2, ...],   battles   ltbattleinfogt   locations   ltlocationinfogt   units   ltunitsinfogt   items   ltitemsinfogt  codepre  pstrongOption2 with only foreign keys in usersstrongp  precodeusers   idltuseridgt,   battles[battle1id, battle2id, ...],   items[item1id, item2id, ...],   locations[location1id, location2id, ...],   units[unit1id, unit2id, ...],   battles   ltbattleinfogt   locations   ltlocationinfogt   units   ltunitsinfogt   items   ltitemsinfogt  codepre  pstrongOption 3 user ids in other tablesstrongp  precodeusers   idltuseridgt,   battles   ltbattleinfogt,   user[user1id, user2id, ...]   locations   ltlocationinfogt,   user[user1id, user2id, ...]   units   ltunitsinfogt,   user[user1id, user2id, ...]   items   ltitemsinfogt,   user[user1id, user2id, ...]  codepre  pOption 1 has a lot of duplication as we are adding complete rows of other tables. One issue I see in this is that if a certain item or battle is updated, we will have to find all occurrences of it in users table and update them as well. But this gives us the advantage of always having a complete users object which can be handed to client application at time of login.p  pOption 2 is more relational where we only have mongoIds of other tables in users table. Advantage of this options is that updating a battle or item doesnt have much cost as rows are referenced not copied. On the other hand, when user logs in we will have to find all referenced units, battles, items, and locations to respond with a complete users object.p  pOption 3 is opposite to option 2 where mongoIds of users table are kept in other tables. This option doesnt appeal much to me.p  pI would really appreciate of someone can guide me or come up with a better model.p  pEditp  pBasically this is an mmorpg game where multiple clients apps will connect to server through webservices. We have got a local db at client to store data. I want a model through which server can respond with a complete user object and then update or insert data changed on client apps.p

Negative 5117 pI am making an android component which allows user to pick date from it. It can be helpful for developer who wants user to select date in his app. In my basic view, I have TextView where date from pop up will be populated into it and I have a button beside TextView. When a User clicks on the button, my component gets popped out and displays Dates. The component gets pops out in a Popup window and shows dates as month view and user also can switch from nextprevious months, nextprevious years just like we do in Calendar. Check the Image. p  pa hrefhttps15.postimage.orgujw8py60bstackoverflow.jpg relnofollowhttps15.postimage.orgujw8py60bstackoverflow.jpga Sorry, I couldnt upload an image here because I am not allowed as I am new User herep  pEach date is a TextView with the width of 35 and height as 30 set by me. DaysDisplayBar is also of some size set by me. So this components whole width is 245 and height is around 200.

Negative 5117 pI would like to know if there is the possibility that my APP can notice when I clicked the red button accidentally or not to end a call. I have an APP running in background that can track the incoming number of the phone at the moment that I receive a call and while doing the call. p  pAs the red button to end a call is not a hardware button in the touch screen phones, Im struggling trying to know how to detect when I pressed that button. And Im starting to think that is not really possible.p  pI have searched and I found that there are ways to know the position that your fingers are touching in the screen while running your APP, I dont know if this is possible when your APP is running in background but as every android phone has a different shape and form of hanging up a phone call this is not a possible solution for my problem.p

ID3 is indicative of a value that was used to determine when a row was stored in the client DB so there may be duplicates in the serverp  precode[ID1]   [ID2]   [index]     [ID3]   [start]         [other1]    [other2] 1   1   1       1   01012000 010000 5       6 1   1   2       2   01012000 010001 4       2 1   1   3       3   01012000 010002 5       2 1   1   4       3   01012000 010003 5       2 1   1   5       4   01012000 010004 4       6 codepre  pWhat I want is a query that will return rows that are unique combinations of [ID3] and the [other1] amp [other2] columns, unique to the [ID1], [ID2] key, with that I would like the emfirstem [start] that fits that criteria, essentially ignoring further occurrences of the same distinct clause.p  pFrom the above table it would return p  precode[ID1]   [ID2]   [index]     [ID3]   [start]         [other1]    [other2] 1   1   1       1   01012000 010000 5       6 1   1   2       2   01012000 010001 4       2 1   1   3       3   01012000 010002 5       2 1   1   5       4   01012000 010004 4       6 codepre  pThe second row with the [ID3] of the value 3 would be ignored, as would any other that had duplicates of [ID3]p  pThe point I cannot seem to get to is the emfirstem value of each distinct combination, because the distinct does not allow me to select the value of the other columns, a group by would require some aggregate function.p

Negative 5117 pI need to log events to the codesyslogcode on the localhost bonlyb. My first trial was with the codelogbackcode codeSyslogAppendercode, but it looks like it writes the logs through UDP. The problem is that the codesyslogcode daemon needs to be configured to access remote logging, which i cant guarantee on all deployment targets. Is there any way to log to codesyslogcode directly  the way codebinloggercode would do it from JAVA  i mean, without needing to go through UDP or TCP p

Negative 5117 pI am creating a fullscreen andengine GLES2 based app.  p  pIn the app there are some settings that the user can select, and Ive used the PreferencesActivity available in android.p  pAll of this works if the device has a physical menu button.  Since this button will be disappearing over time, I have added a ButtonSprite to my screen that I would like to open the preferences activity as if the menu button was pressed.  I am not using an action bar as this is a full screen app and do not want to forfeit any more screen real estate.p  pI have everything wired up so that I know when the button is touched, but am at a loss to determine what I should call to instantiate the preferences activity.p  pI am sure that this is a simple matter, however, the documentation and examples have not provided any clues, at least to me.p  pSo, given that I know where to place the call to get the preferences activity displayed, what do I call to actually get this to happenp  pThanks in advance,p  pB.p

Negative 5117 pIve done a lot of research for Google App engine. I ended up with webapp2. Now we realized that AWS has many advantages over GAE for our project.p  pI feel a little bit overwhelmed because there is so much information about AWS. I ended up with the nosql dynamoDB solution. p  pNow I really love lightweight frameworks like webapp2 , its really simple and easy to use. It also dont hide post and get from you.p  pNow does it makes sense to use webapp2 for AWS  Mabye there other frameworks that would fit better for our project.  emWe want to go in a filehosting directionemp  pI mean there are literally 50 frameworks for python.

Negative 5117 pI have an application that is written in codeMonotouchcode and one function that it offers is taking photos that are then synchronized back to a codeSybase Sql Anywherecode database on our server. This mechanism is working fine on the codeWindowscode version of our application, but on codeiOScode we have hit technical issues pertaining to saving the photos in the codeSybase Ultralitecode database on the iPad or iPhone. Very briefly, the photos are saving correctly if we set the resolution to VERY low on an iPhone, but failing if the resolution is higher. The issue is related to the size of the image data that is being saved. On an codeiPadcode, the photos are generally larger than those taken with an codeiPhonecode, so saving to the database is failing more often on codeiPadcode than codeiPhonecode.p  pAnyway, that is just some background to our situation and the actual codeUltralitecode issue is not the focus of this question. What I am looking for here is emalternative solutionsem codeObjectiveCcode or codeMonotouchcode for providing this functionality. I immediately think about saving to a local database and then replicating the photo data back to the server because I have a lot of experience with database replication. But maybe there is a better way of solving thisp  pThe solution must allow the application top  ul liSave a photo so that it is available locally even after shutdown of the application or restart of the deviceli liMust allow photos to taken and saved offline, because an internet connection is not always available.li liEither synchronize the image data back to the server database or synchronize a URL back that the application in the backoffice can retrieve the photo. Obviously, at the point of synchronization the application must be online.li ul  pCan anyone suggest solutions or APIs that might allow me to provide this functionality without having to synchronize the image data I am thinking along the lines of maybe saving the image to the cloud and then synchronizing only a URL that can be used in the backoffice to retrieve the photo. Any suggestionsp

Found out, that earlier the automaticly generated plistfile contained the bundleversion of the current build.p  pId like to get this bundleversion into my plist automatically, when exporting the archive to my desktop, because thats a main action I do very often.p  pIs there an easy way to add the bundle version to the plist automatically or do I have to write a shell script, which opens the .ipa and reads the information to write it to the plist laterp  pI want to use this, to send my beta testers reminders to update the beta app, when the version differs to the installed bundle version.p  pAny ideas or hintsp

Negative 5117 pIm working on a little game that is uses soundpool to play small soundfiles. However, it now seems that I have too many sound files that I want to add to the soundpool since I get an error saying that the heap has an overflow. So then I tried to load the sound files when they are needed instead of loading them when the class instance is initialized, but the result of that turned out very bad.p  pAre there any other ways I can make it work using soundpool or do I have to use media player instead I already have media player class that is used to play long sound clips like music files and so on. So the backup plan is to make two instances of the media player class that runs on two separate threads where one of them handles the small sound files. Any help and ideas is highly appreciated.p  pGreetingsp

Negative 5117 pIve been working quite som time now to learn how to implement DDD, IoC and ensure there is a separation of concerns in my application. Im also trying to get in to the way of Test First Development.p  pSomehow Entity Framework gives med some trouble. I have a domain project that keeps my domain objects many of them POCO classes now, but with some behavior. Its legacy code, and I try to refactor it, but MVC realies heavily on Dataannotations for validation. p  pThe datavalidationattributes is set on the domain objects, which ties them  to the entity framework. Most instructional videos and documentation on EF also uses a lot of attributes on the domain objects. p  pstrongSo I wonder if this is really a good thingstrongp  pI like the idea of many of the attributes, but the consequence of putting them on the domian objects makes me feel that entity framework is the core of the application and not the domain objects.p  pDo you have any tips on solving this, or is this how it should bep  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pThe suggested answers below led me to this post answered by a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8894367howtomakefluentapiconfigurationworkwithmvcclientsidevalidationLadislav Mrnkaap  pTo me that probably sounds like the best way to go if it solves my problem.

Why not to use SystemClock.uptimeMillis or System.nanoTime Because my system needs to keep working while in sleepscreen is off.p  pAny better approach herep  pAfter that, the most problematic step how to handle the timed events and guarantee they happen at desired time, without lagsdelaysvariationsp  pAfter reading as much as I could I decided to go for the handler approach, having one of them for each class of event so different classes can happen asynchronously.p  pUnfortunately this isnt working as expected  The timming sometimes gets perfectly synchonized and sometimes gets really big constant delays. without changing the code at all, just launching the application minutes after. Any clock synchronization issues between threads event generator and event handler are in different threads  The handler timming isnt constantprecise and I can easely notice event results being displayed out of sync with a variable lag.p  pAny tips about how to handle timed events in a more precise way in Androidp  pThanks, Gabriel Simesp
Negative 5117 pI have three mysql tables that I would like to extract some information from, the tables are p  ul liVideos  represents a video with a score. li liTags  contains a global list of tags.li liVideoTags creates an association between a Video and a Tag.li ul  pWhat I want to do is find the videos with the highest points for each tag. There are many videos with the same tag, but my result set will have the same number of rows as there are tags. The end goal is to have a list of the best video by points for each unique tag tags being a topic prefixed with a hash.p  pMy SQL noob attempt at achieving this is as followsp  precode  SELECT video.id AS videoid, video.ownerid, MAXvideo.points, tag.id AS tagid     FROM Videos video, VideoTags videotag, Tags tag    WHERE video.id  videotag.videoid      AND videotag.tagid  tag.id      AND tag.content LIKE  GROUP BY tag.id codepre  pHeres the schema and sample datap  precodeDROP TABLE IF EXISTS Video CREATE TABLE Video    id varchar24 NOT NULL default ,   ownerid varchar24 NOT NULL default ,   points DOUBLE NOT NULL default 0   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Tags CREATE TABLE Tags    id int11 NOT NULL AUTOINCREMENT,   content varchar32 NOT NULL default  PRIMARY KEY id   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS VideoTags CREATE TABLE VideoTags    videoid varchar24 NOT NULL default ,   tagid int11 NOT NULL   INSERT INTO Videos id,ownerid,points VALUES ownerxvideoa,ownerx, 20 INSERT INTO Videos id,ownerid,points VALUES ownerxvideob,ownerx, 15 INSERT INTO Videos id,ownerid,points VALUES owneryvideok,ownery, 12 INSERT INTO Videos id,ownerid,points VALUES owneryvideol,ownery, 17 INSERT INTO Videos id,ownerid,points VALUES owneryvideom,ownery, 44  INSERT INTO Tags id, content VALUES 111, topic1 INSERT INTO Tags id, content VALUES 222, topic2  INSERT INTO VideoTags videoid,tagid VALUES ownerxvideoa,111 INSERT INTO VideoTags videoid,tagid VALUES ownerxvideob,111 INSERT INTO VideoTags videoid,tagid VALUES owneryvideok,111 INSERT INTO VideoTags videoid,tagid VALUES owneryvideol,222 INSERT INTO VideoTags videoid,tagid VALUES owneryvideom,222 codepre  pWhat I expect to see isp  precodevideoid          ownerid    MAXvideo.points  tagid ownerxvideoa   ownerx     20                 111 owneryvideom   ownery     44                 222 codepre  pbut what I get isp  precodevideoid          ownerid    MAXvideo.points  tagid ownerxvideoa   ownerx     20                 111 owneryvideol   ownery     44                 222 codepre  pUnfortunately the videoid for the second row is not what I expected, as owneryvideol does not have 44 points, rather it has 17 so would not be the highest scoring video for the tag with id 222.p  pAny Masters of the SQL Universe out there that can help me out Thanks a million p

Negative 5117 pIm attempting to build a system where users can easily create various types of tournaments and participate in them with other users.

Negative 5117 pIf I call codetoSeqcode on an immutable codeSetcode collection I get an codeArrayBuffercode.p  precodescalagt Set1,2,3.toSeq  returns Seq[Int]  ArrayBuffer1, 2, 3 codepre  pThis surprises me. Given Scalas emphasis on using immutable data structures, I expect to get back an immutable sequence like a codeVectorcode or codeListcode instead of a mutable codeArrayBuffercode. The returned ordering of the set elements should of course be undefined, but there doesnt seem to be any semantic reason why that ordering should also be mutable.p  pIn general, I expect Scala operations to always produce immutable results unless I explicitly request a mutable one. This has been my assumption all along, but it is an incorrect one here, and I actually just spent an hour debugging a problem where the unexpected presence of an codeArrayBuffercode led to a runtime error in a codematchcode statement. My fix was to change codeSet....toSeqcode to codeSet....toListcode, but this feels like a hack because theres nothing about my application that requires a list in particular at that point.p  pIs having codeSet....toSeqcode return a mutable object a flaw in Scalas implementation, or is there a principle I am misunderstanding herep  pThis is Scala 2.9.2.p

Negative 5117 pMy colleague has a very strange problem on his PC.p  pWhen he runs his application in the debugger Visual Studio 2010 everything runs fine.  But when he sets a breakpoint anywhere, it doesnt matter where, and the breakpoint is hit, the next step will raise an access violation in the application.  We looked at the disassembly, and the address on which he complains is not accessed.  If we step a second time, we see the violated address on top of the call stack, although we dont see a call to it.p  pIt looks like there is something overwriting the call stack, but apparently only after a breakpoint has been hit.p  pThe PC has already been rebooted, but that didnt help.

But how would I set all this up in the column mappings Thanksp  pCurrently, my cell processors have this structure, and I am using a CsvMapReader.p  precodeprivate static final CellProcessor[] CELLPROCESSORS  new CellProcessor[]          new NotNullnew Trimnew StrRegExd10,,   phone1         new Optionalnew Trimnew StrRegExd10,,  phone2         new Optionalnew Trimnew StrRegExd10,,  phone3         new Optionalnew Trim,                            callVar1         new Optionalnew Trim,                            callVar2         new Optionalnew Trim,                            callVar3         new Optionalnew Trim,                            callVar4         new Optionalnew Trim,                            callVar5         new Optionalnew Trim,                            callVar6         new Optionalnew Trim,                            callVar7         new Optionalnew Trim,                            callVar8         new Optionalnew Trim,                            callVar9         new Optionalnew Trim,                            callVar10   private Contact mapRowToContactMapltString, Objectgt row      Contact contact  new Contact      MyPhoneContactMethodData methodData  new MyPhoneContactMethodData      ListltPhonegt phones  new ArrayListltgt     Phone phone  new Phone     phone.setPhoneNumberStringrow.getphone1     phones.addphone     phone  new Phone     phone.setPhoneNumberStringrow.getphone2     if phone.getPhoneNumber  null          phones.addphone          phone  new Phone     phone.setPhoneNumberStringrow.getphone3     if phone.getPhoneNumber  null          phones.addphone          methodData.setPhonesphones      ListltStringgt callVars  new ArrayListltgt     callVars.addStringrow.getcallVar1     callVars.addStringrow.getcallVar2     callVars.addStringrow.getcallVar3     callVars.addStringrow.getcallVar4     callVars.addStringrow.getcallVar5     callVars.addStringrow.getcallVar6     callVars.addStringrow.getcallVar7     callVars.addStringrow.getcallVar8     callVars.addStringrow.getcallVar9     callVars.addStringrow.getcallVar10     methodData.setEnterpriseCallVarDatacallVars      MapltContactMethod, ContactMethodDatagt methodDataMap  new HashMapltgt     methodDataMap.putContactMethod.PHONE, methodData     contact.setContactMethodDatamethodDataMap      return contact  codepre  pA codeContactcode has this structure, with many other unrelated fieldsp  precodepublic class Contact      private Integer id     private MapltContactMethod, ContactMethodDatagt contactMethodData  codepre  pcodeContactMethodcode is an enum, with values codePHONEcode and codeEMAILcode. codeContactMethodDatacode is an interface, of which the superclass of codeMyPhoneContactMethodDatacode implements.p

Negative 5117 pSo I am in the design phase of a project for work software support and would like to gather the communities opinions, ideas, etc. before I get to far into the woods. Ultimately I am building a web page that is very similar to Twitters Trending page. Here is a high level overview of how I will be using itp  pOur support reps will be creating tickets for customers as they call in, the text of the ticket is capture in real time and sent to another server I will refer to as Hoss. Once the data is received by Hoss, we begin to parse the text. The primary interest here is a textarea where the support rep types in a brief summary of the issue the customer is having. I want to take this information, parse it and display it on a webpage that lists trending topics so managers can get a real time idea of what customers are calling in about.p  pNow the fun stuff and where I would like to get some direction...For this example. lets say the summary textarea contained the followingp  blockquote   pCustomer is getting an error when trying to install updates, error   in update.exep blockquote  pNow that the Hoss server has this text it can begin to parse it. I am interested in capturing keywords for the trending feed. In this example, error, install, update.exe. However, it is also important to capturetrack keywords that appear together. Meaning, I can easily capture error and install and basically count how many times those words have appeared in any given time, but they will not give as much insight alone as they would together.p  pAgain, I am at the very early stages of this project which is why I have not attached code examples, etc. Nothing is off limits at this point Thank you in advance After spending many many hours reading through posts, Ive learned the power of this community and it is an invaluable resourcep

Negative 5117 pIm currently using ActiveMQ for my queueing system, and Im wanting to make the transition to RabbitMQ. One feature Ive been using that belongs to ActiveMQ is a redelivery policy, as sometimes our consumer rejects a message because it cannot handle it at this time, but may want to try again later, so it requeues it. p  pRight now in AMQP, when I reject a message, its instantly pulled off the queue again immediately and tried again. p  pIs there a way, in RabbitMQ, to specify a redelivery policy for a queue, consumer, or messagep

If there are multiple global minima then print them all. Please suggest the algorithm with better time and space complexity. We cant go for brute force approach.p
Negative 5117 pIm building a service in which microphone data, recorded in a flash client is sent to a python server where it is processed. I am using a custom protocol for this and everything works beautifully. p  pHowever, in corporate networks firewalls often block the connection from the client to the server, even if it takes place on standard web ports like 80 and 443. I guess this has to do with the fact that these firewalls detect that the data does not follow the HTTP protocol.p  pCan I fix thisp

So I found solution that downloaded entrust certification.cer and did openssl sclient connect gateway.push.apple.com2195 cert xxxx.pem CAfile entrust2048ca.cer, and it returned Verify return code 0. So I added my php code streamcontextsetoptionctx, ssl, CAfile, entrust2048ca.cer, but it didnt work same problem.p

I took a look at the overloading in the method and tried using the SID equivalent of the user.Group instead of the literal String. This seems to work, but now another problem comes up. When the user is not on the network I cant translate the Group Name string from SQL into these SIDs.p  pMy current workaround is that when the user is connected to the domain, I save the SIDs and the groups into a lookup table encrypted, then when the network is not connected, I take the group name from the database and literally lookup the SID string in the table.p  pThe code Im using to convert the group name to SID is the followingp  precode Get all groups available to the user         For i As Integer  0 To WindowsIdentity.GetCurrent.Groups.Count  1             Dim ir As IdentityReference  WindowsIdentity.GetCurrent.Groupsi             sidi  New SecurityIdentifierir.Value             sidNamei  CTypeir.TranslateGetTypeNTAccount, NTAccount.Value               Write to file as csv             writer.WriteLinesidNamei  ,  sidi.ToString         Next codepre  pThen I lookup the group name like sop  precodeIf File.ExistsFILEPATH  True Then         Dim reader As New StreamReaderFILEPATH         While Not reader.EndOfStream             Dim sTemp As String  reader.ReadLine.Split,             If groupName.EqualssTemp0 Then                 Return New SecurityIdentifiersTemp1             End If         End While     End If codepre  pThe reason I cant translate the group name to a SID when not on the network is because the codeIdentityReference.Translatecode throws an exception because it cant see the domain.p  pSo, finally after all this explanation, heres what Im looking for. Im thinking that there must be access somewhere for me to get the SID from a group name, because windows MUST be storing it somewhere, otherwise I wouldnt be able to login to windows when not connected to the network.p  pIve done a lot of searching and I havent been able to figure out where these cached credentials are stored. Any help would be appreciated and if I havent been clear enough let me know and Ill try to explain as best I can.p

Negative 5117 pI am making a tiny game app in my free time, and I have just recently hit a wall.p  pThe idea is that there is a fixed grid of codeBoxcodees available and that many codeJewelcodes as well.p  pBoth boxes and jewels can come in different colors. As with color space, the three basic type of boxes are Red, Yellow and Blue. The other ones available are, of course, Orange, Purple, Green, with a special White box.p  pI also have the Jewels, which correspond to the same colors as boxes.p  pNow, the logic is as followingp  ul liPrimary color boxes will give reward only if they contain a gem whose color is the same as the box color or is made from the box color ul liFor example, red box will give bonus if there is a red, orange or purple jewel inside it because of the following ul liRed is made of Redli liOrange is made of Red and Yellowli liPurple is made of Red and Blueli liWhite is made of Red, Blue and Yellowli ulli liRed box wont give any bonus for Green jewel, because Green is Blue and Yellow and there is no Red in thereli ulli liSecondary color boxes cannot accept any of the primary color jewels because secondary color boxes are made of at least two colors, while primary gems are made of 1 color only. ul liGiven that, secondary color boxes can only accept the corresponding color jewel, plus the white one.li ulli liAnd as an exception to the rules above, white box is like a bonus box, which can accept all jewelsli ul  pIm puzzled with how to make the domain model for this so it doesnt contain or contains as least as possible codeifcodes and codeinstanceofcodes.p  pAlso, if I would like to extend the types of boxes and jewels one day, Id like it to be done in any of the following two ways by adding new classes without having to change old ones.p

Negative 5117 pI need a HTML page to access Google Drive files with codeXMLHttpRequestcode XHR in Javascript without authentication so my users dont have to be signed in with or have a Google account. These files have permission Anyone with link. Since these files are open for the world having the link I dont see why it would be a problem to allow Crossorigin resource sharing CORS for them.p  pThe codedownloadUrlcode requires authentication, so I guess that isnt a viable option. I have also looked at the codewebViewLinkcode, which I guess requires the files to be Public on the web  turning up in search engines, etc, I guess. The is not a viable option for me either. I need the Anyone with link permission for these files. The most promising link is the codewebContentLinkcode, which according to a hrefhttpgoogleappsdeveloper.blogspot.se2012085thingsyoudidntknowyoucoulddo.htmlhttpgoogleappsdeveloper.blogspot.se2012085thingsyoudidntknowyoucoulddo.htmla allow public and unauthenticated access.p  pThe problem I have with codewebContentLinkcode is that it doesnt seem to be CORS friendly. My attempts with XHR in Chrome fail quite silently. I dont add any headers.p  pMy attempts with codecurlcode using codeheader Origin httpwww.hello.secode and both with and without codeheader AccessControlRequestMethod GETcode results in a codeHTTP1.1 302 Moved Temporarilycode redirect to a shortlived content URL. The problem is that the redirect response has no signs of an codeAccessControlAllowOrigincode header, which is needed to enable CORS.p  pIs there anything I can do differently to get this to workp  pOtherwise Google SDK team, can you make make the codewebContentLinkcode CORS friendly for public files which dont need cookie authentication, pleasep
Negative 5117 pJust read on Googles Group for Wallet merchant support that the forum was being moved here, to stack overflow. Anyway, this is really a question for googles engineers. I have updated the postback URL multiple times from our google wallet merchant account, and every time have been greeted with the following message An unexpected error has occurred. Please try again later.p  pLater, when I refresh the page a few minutes following, the new postback url that I entered will appear to have taken. However, our merchant account will still not postback to the right URL. Sometimes this corrects itself 68 hours after entry  other times it does not.p  pWhat gives Im very frustrated with googles inapp digital goods service for the preceding reason and am close to seeking out an alternate solution even after 10 developer hours implementing this with our subscriptions registration systemp

Negative 5117 pI have seen a lot of questions about this lately but I think that there should be something easier than to codeGroup Bycode by one column and making all the other fields of the selected table as codeMincode, codeMaxcode, codeAveragecode functions.

Negative 5117 pi am wondering about the difference between the two mentioned patterns. when you consider, that you need synchronization code in the presentation model pattern and that code is in the presentation model itself, then i think the patterns are quite similar.p  pBoth delegate events to the presentation model  presenter. presentation model and presenter command the domain model and do also observe the domain model. on occuring changes, they both sync with the view since the synchronisation code in the presentation model is in the presentation model. p  pin my opinion the difference is, that presentation model is an abstract form of the view. it describes the state and behavior of the view. so it has properties for all view state information. and this information is synched via sync code.  in passive view, the presenter is not nessessarily seen as an abstract form of the view. so the presenter does not nessessarily have properties representing the view state. so the presenter does not sync the states perperties on controls and the presenter itself. instead he simply copies on changes domain data to the controls.  so the difference is in essence the abstraction of the view, that presentation model provides while in passive view the presenter coud be seen as a data mapper for domain data.p  pis that ok so far or do i miss something importantp  pthanks and best regards patrickp

Negative 5117 pI need some help for the following issue using Webdriver, Java, and Firefox.p  pIn the testing, when clicking on a link,  1 it will often open a new window with a normal web page.  OR 2 occasionally, it will open a new window with aboutblank in address bar after 20 to 60 seconds the new window will disappear and a file download window will appear.p  pBecause the URL is rewritten for SEO, there is no way to check the URL before or after clicking on the link to determine whether the link connects to a normal web page or a downloadable file.p  pIn both cases,      driver.getWindowHandles.size  2, so I can switch to the new window successfully using the following statements in order to check whether a certain WebElement exists in new window.     for String winHandle  driver.getWindowHandles          driver.switchTo.windowwinHandle     p  pBut if the link connects to a downloadable file, the execution will hang for any of the following methods     findElementBy.xpathhtml     findElementsBy.tagNamebody     getCurrentUrl     getPageSource     getTitle     getWindowHandlep  pgetWindowHandles always returns 2 while new window with aboutblank in address bar presents before it is replaced by the file download dialog.

Negative 5117 pIve been researching all day and not gotten very far. Im on windows 7, using directx 11. My final output is to be a frame of video onto a DX11 texture I want to decode some very large H.264 video files, and the CPU using libav doesnt cut it.p  pIve looked at the hwaccel capabilities of libav using DXVA2, but hit a road block when I need to create a IDirectXVideoDecoder, which can only be created with a D3D9 interface. which I dont have using DX11p  pWhenever Ive looked up DXVA documentation, it doesnt reference DX11, was this removed in DX10 or 11 Cant find any confirmation of this, nor anywhere that says DXVA2 is redundant, possibly that its been superceeded by DXVAHDp  pThen Ive looked into the media foundation SDK as that looks like what Im supposed to use for DX11... But none of the types exist in my headers The docs say to just include , but this yields nothing. They also specify a minimum of windows 8 to use it.p  pI believe to use MF I need the windows 8 SDK, which now includes all the directx libsheaders.p  pSo this leaves a gap with windows 7... Is it possible to get hardware accelerated video decoding and if so, which API am I supposed to be usingp

Negative 5117 pI am using maven to run JUnit Selenium tests as part of the build. I get the error shown in the stack trace below.p  pI looked at essentially all other relevant posts out there, but none address the issue of the latest version of Firefox and Selenium 2.4.0 and the issue still happening. Most past posts claim that this issue is fixed with the Selenium 1.0.3 and beyond.  p  pFurthermore, I tried to go to the location of the parent.lock file to delete it as a workaround, but the .lock file was not visible. I tried specifying an alternate firefox profile, but this doesnt seem to matter either.  p  pWhy is it not allowing me to open Firefox when it is specifying a .lock file that does not exist I have

Negative 5117 pFirst of all, I have googled and searched on SO for this question. None of the answers Ive seen are really satisfactory for me. I am aware of resolve amp manually bootstrapping angular and neither are great solutions for us.p  pEssentially our app is constructed such that at the top level, we have a p  precodeltbody ngcontrollerapplicationControllergt codepre  pthat instantiates a bunch of stuff. Part of that is getting some data from our server and setting it so that children controllers have access to it. So the issue is sometimes the children controllers are executed before the server has responded.p  pWe use angular UIs uirouter so we can take advantage of states. However resolve hasnt been a great solution for us because we have a bunch of routes and a user can enter the app from any of them. So far my only solutions are to create a very high level parent state and putting a resolve on that, or putting a resolve a multitude of states. Is there a way to make the ajax call before the angular controllers are runp

Negative 5117 pI am using the GhostPDL pcl6 application to print text files to PDFs. The text files contain captured text from a serial port connected to a PLC controller. Some of the print data is from an older system that used only line feed LF for end of line termination and did not provide the CR carriage return character. The results were the PDF prints had the Stair Stepping problem. A laser printer can be set to AUTO CR to allow the prints to print normally.

Negative 5117 pIm starting the process of converting an app to Core Data.  I built the data model and, at first, got Xcode to successfully create codeNSManagedObjectcode custom classes corresponding to the entities. But then I realized the entity and class names didnt have my application prefix, which I thought would dramatically increase the workload of required coding changes for the conversion to Core Data.  p  pSo I removed the references to the custom classes, renamed my entities in the data model with my prefix, reset the class attribute for each entity to default, and tried to create the custom classes again. I get through the wizard just as before, but now Xcode refuses to create classes for the entities, and instead creates one headerimplementation pair with the application name. The .h and .m files correspond to the entity Im classing or the last entity in the list when I select multiple, but the names and relationships are invalid, of course, and so are useless. Can anyone explain why Xcode is doing this, and how to resolve itp

Negative 5117 pwe have a big problem in our development team. p  pWe are using Hibernate and we have some entities which are related in two transitive onetomany relations. The main object is a Group which has a list of Property instances, and each Property containing a list of Values.p  pThe mappings are down aheadp  pWe have two main problemsp  pA When making a HQL Query, Criteria Query or SQLQuery it doesnt matter the conditions applied in JOINs or WHERE clauses, Hibernate always retrieves for us all the underlying objects. For example, if I make a Criteria or SQL getting only the Group objects, Hibernate comes and lazy or not gets all the Property and Value instances too. We want to control this. We want to do left joins and get only the properties with no values inside Hibernate removes these properties with no valuep  pB When making the Query, for example, a SQL, it shows in the log the SQL code we want. Everything seems perfect. But after that it brings every instance in the list without applying conditions, getting them only by id, and we can assure this because with lazytrue we see the load manytoone queries in the log.p  pIs there something we can do in hibernate config, fetching modestrategy, the mappings configuration or anywhere Im thinking on going on Result transformers now. p  pI would be grateful if someone coud give me a hint or tell me where to find a solution to this problem.

Negative 5117 pI have registered an error handler in my application that shows a user dialog MessageBox when an unhandled exception occurs. Its connected to the Application.DispatcherUnhandledException event and thus happens on the UI thread. Now Ive seen a situation where an exception is thrown regularly, once per second, and new dialogs kept popping up. I was trying to prevent this with a lock, but since its all on the same thread, this doesnt have any effect. An additional sleep lock on the same thread obviously led to a single blocked MessageBox on the screen.p  pThe MessageBox seems to free the UI thread for other MessageBoxes to appear. How can I prevent that without blocking the threadp  pThe user has the choice to continue or exit the application. When continuing, the next queued MessageBox should appear, it should not be discarded. If too many messages show up in a time, the user can still decide to exit the application.p

Negative 5117 pThe idea is quite simple, i.e try to not follow the standard. For example to inject some thing to Firefox, malware need to know that the name of process is firefox.exe or to inject some thing in internet explorer, malware need to know that process is iexplorer.exe. But if  Firefox or internet explorer do not follow that convention then it will be hard. Idea is to put a logic to change the name of process. For this the real firefox.exe is replaced with our firefox.exe file. This duplicate file is just a startup , the real Firefox executable is renamed to some random string.exe. When system triggers firefox.exe, this will open our firefox.exe executable. This executable will inturn open the real Firefox exectable as random string.exe and also set the dummy process information using the SetProcessInformation API. Using SetProcessInformation we will set false location of the executable so malware is not able to find the real process based on the location.p  pCan any body suggest how feasible it is provided SetProcessInformation can set false process locationp

Negative 5117 pIs there an fast and easy way to discover the precedence and associativity a function in GHCIp  pIve found that one straightforward method is to bruteforce combining one operator with another other until you get a precedence parsing error PPE. For example, to discover the precedenceassociativity of codecode, we can define 10 different operators of codeinfix ncode for code0  n lt 10codep  precodegtgtgt let infix 0     gtgtgt undefined  undefined  undefined  Exception Prelude.undefined gtgtgt let infix 1     gtgtgt undefined  undefined  undefined  Exception Prelude.undefined [...] gtgtgt let infix 8     gtgtgt undefined  undefined  undefined  Exception Prelude.undefined gtgtgt let infix 9     gtgtgt undefined  undefined  undefined  ltinteractivegt211     Precedence parsing error         cannot mix  [infix 9] and  [infixl 9] in the same infix expression codepre  pThe error tells you what the predences and fixities are. Since the 10 functions defined are nonassociative, theres no chance of avoiding a PPE when the precedence levels are equal. The nave approach would have been to try 10 functions of each associativity, giving a WCET of 20 because if you start on the same associativity as the target, the 10 with that associativity would pass, but then the failure would happen once you get to the codekthcode precedence of the next associativity, where codekcode is the precedence of the target function.p  pBut is there a faster way I strongthinkstrong you can do bisection to achieve log10 steps on average. For example, if the target was codecode which is defined as codecode, but with codeinfixl 6code, we could make an expression code[]  AB  1code, where codecode is one of the same 10 dummy functions. If the precedence of codecode is too low to cause a PPE, the expression will yield codeBcode because the expression will parse to code[]  AB  1code, while if the precedence is too high, it will yield codecode because the expression will parse to code[]  AB  1code. Examplep  precodegtgtgt let infixl 6     gtgtgt let infix 5     gtgtgt []  AB  1 B gtgtgt too low gtgtgt let infix 7     gtgtgt []  AB  1  Exception Prelude. index too large  gtgtgt too high gtgtgt let infix 6     gtgtgt []  AB  1  ltinteractivegt101     Precedence parsing error         cannot mix  [infix 6] and  [infixl 6] in the same infix expression gtgtgt got it codepre  pHowever, Im not sure about this approach.p  ul liYou have to maintain the mental state of which number to guess next, and do the division etc in your head by papercalculator would probably be slower than just doing the 10 steps in the straightforward methodli liIs it fully general Can you always construct a test expression like thisli liIm not sure if I can always come up with an expression like this faster than I can just do the straightforward method. In this case it was indeed faster, and I actually came up with the bisection method strongbeforestrong I came up with the straightforward methodli liIf the previous concern holds valid, does there exist a fully general way to automatically generate expressions of this kindli ul  pIs anyone aware of an alternative method I can imagine there might be a way to just do this in a single step. But after an hour, the best I could come up with is this bisection method.p

Negative 5117 pI am trying to see if in 2014, were at a place where returning a JSON or XML document via a rest service from say, JAXRS spring implementation will be compatible when used by another library possibly in another language If I write a Windows mobile .net client that consumes my Java JAXRS api, will the way the JAXRS returns the json andor xml convert correctly in the .net client Or are there issues with various languages and librariesp  pI ask this because in one case in particular, we return a collection of items, and in XML it will result in thisp  precodeltitemsgt   ltitem attrvaluegtanother valueltitemgt   ltitem attrvalue2gtanother value2ltitemgt ltitemsgt codepre  pThe resulting JSON looks something likep  precodeitems [    attrvalue,valueanother value,    attrvalue2, valueanother value2   ] codepre  pHowever, in using online xml to json and json to xml.. when I paste the above XML and get the above json conversion.. then past the json above into the json to xml converter.. the xml is different.. it becomesp  precodeltitemsgt   ltitemgt     ltelement attrvaluegtanother valueltelementgt     ltelement attrvalue2gtanother value2ltelementgt   ltitemgt ltitemsgt codepre  pMy concern is that on our service side code.. we use a library to take the incoming xml or json and turn it in to an object. If the above XML were to be sent due to some client side marshalling it like that.. our server side would throw exceptions.. not able to handle the  type. p  pI also see in some cases JSON that converts xml attributes into attrNamevalue.p  pSo.. is there any way to ensure that the json and xml we return is correct and can be readparsed by any client Are there some things we should document with regards to the emtypeem of json being returned that would give hints on how to properly configure a different library to make sure to marshal the same json from the data I see for example in the Eclipse Moxy, there are some configurations that can be set. p  pIn my past, I simply used Jersey with JAXRS and it handled json and xml for me.. I never thought about issues like different consumer libraries converting what my JAXRS sends out into something not compatible, especially in a case where for example they use our XSDs to generate POJOs in their languagelibrary of choice, that may not match with what our XSD to POJO generates.p

If you first click on a node to zoomin, and then trigger the sizecount transition, the nodes that should be shown are not correctly displayed.p  pMy solution to this is to avoid triggering the sizecount transition if the graph has been zoomed in I reset the sunburst by simulating a click on the root node to zoom out and then changing sizecount. This approach does work, but the visual effects are not very pleasing, a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netemiguevara7dr2q relnofollowas you can see in my examplea. This is one of the two ways that I am testing graph reset and sizecount transition triggered by a radio button change event.p  precode Sizecount radiobuttons with reset 1  dispatch both transitions on same event d3.selectAllinputsize1, inputcount1     .onchange, function       reset     var rootnode  d3.selectrootnode     var check  simulateClickrootnode[0][0]      sizecount     if check  true          var changevalue  this.value         path.datapartition.valuefunctiond              if changevaluesize  return d.size              else if changevaluecount  return 1                   .transition         .delay400         .duration600         .attrTweend, arcTweenSwitch       codepre  pLeaving aside implementation choices trigger transitions on same event or on different events and browser issues tried Firefox and Chrome with different results, the problem is that two transitions seem to overlap. Using .delay in the second one does not help.p  pThe visual effect is that the second transition, instead of being a single smooth process, it seems to snap into the final stage at once, to then go back to the initial stage and playing the transition smoothly from the start.p  pAny pointers or advice warmly welcome...

Negative 5117 pI am laying the ground work for a multitennant application. Our strategy on the database side is to have some schemas shared properties, persmissions and other nontenant data and have each tenant have their own schema. This is not a question on the merits of that decision.p  pI am looking for a Connection Pool which like Oracles Universal Connection UCP Pool allows me to set the schema on the connection that I retrieve. For the sake of this discussion, lets assume that we have all schemas stored on one database cluster and are accessible by the same user context. I do not want to use Oracles UCP. It has concurrency issues I am wanting to avoid and I am not using Oracle but PostgreSQL instead.p  pIdeally I want to say Pool.getConnectionforSchema. p  pI can build a wrapper in front of BoneCP to achieve this, but I am hoping to avoid that.p  pBoneCP is currently selected by me because performance is a particular concern with this endeavor, so at this time I am still open to change this decision if some other connection pool natively allows for this behavior.p  pIf I can achieve this with BoneCP so much the better  please illuminate me.p  pThank you in advance.p

Negative 5117 pMy situationp  pI use an codeAsyncTaskcode to prepare data for a google map. Because this task takes some time, Id like to display the objects as they are ready and not all at once when finished. So I use codepublishProgresscodeampcodeonProgressUpdatecode to update the map.br I use the Google Maps Android API utility library to add the markers to the map. I call codeClusterManager.clustercode after data changes to force reloading of the markers.p  pThe problemp  pNothing happens. Updating a codeProgressBarcode from codeonProgressUpdatecode works flawlessly but displaying the markers on the map does not. I can see that all the methods that are supposed to get called do get called and Ive tested that these methods work fine when called not from an codeAsyncTaskcode. emAfterem the AsyncTask finishes, all the markers get magically displayed, even though no further method gets called.br If I use the same method to add markers directly to the map through standard API i.e. instead of adding them to the cluster manager the markers appear as they are supposed to.p  pSo the question is  is there any reason for the cluster manager to wait with the reclustering until the AsyncTask finishes EDIT More precisely, not after codedoInBackgroundcode finishes but after codeonPostExecutecode finishes.p  pIm having trouble understanding and debugging this problem, spent a whole day with it already.br Thanks in advancep

Negative 5117 pI need to select an element in a dropdown window.  Every time I open the dropdown window in the site I am testing, the website randomly generates an id for that dropdown window.  Previous instances of the dropdown window are visible using Firebug but not selectable.  There is a static path but it only works when I test it with ChromeDriver, and not when I use FirefoxDriver.  Locating the dynamically generated elements by class name each instance of the dropdown window has the same class works the first time I try it but I get errors every time after that using both ChromeDriver and FirefoxDriver.

Negative 5117 pIve got some code that had previously apparently needed to have brackets applied to a SQL statement due to a column named Name the fixed code wasp  precodedynSQL  string.FormatDELETE FROM Platypi WHERE duckbill  0 and [Name]  1, tmpType, tmpStr codepre  pUnfortunately, this code was not doing its job  the record was not being deleted. Removing the brackets around the Name columnp  precodedynSQL  string.FormatDELETE FROM Platypi WHERE duckbill  0 and Name  1, tmpType, tmpStr codepre  p...caused it to work. Why would adding the suspenders to the column name cause the column to be unrecognized An answer to a question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions25298045whyisthissqlupdatefailingcolumnnameisnotvalidherea indicates that encasing column names and table names in brackets is a safe way to avoid naming collisions with other objectsdatabase keywords and such.p  pWhen the SQL with the brackets fails, no err msg is displayed, it just doesnt work.p  pNote, though, that this is inconsistent sometimes the SQL which contains the [Name] as opposed to Name works fine  IOW, sometimes the same SQL statement with the same val for duckbill but a different one for Name works with valerie it fails when the column named Name is bracketed.p

Negative 5117 pIm trying to set up a CI build for my Android development Android SDK Tools V23.0.2. This is currently all running on my local machine with Ubuntu 14.04.1. However, I have problems getting the emulator to work properly.p  pFrom within Eclipse, I can launch the emulator, and it works fine and even quite fast. The only minor issue I had was that screenshots taken with Robotium would not work until I switched off the emulators Use Host GPU option.p  pOn Jenkins V1.576, I use the Android Emulator plugin V2.11.1, and here the fun starts. First of all, I can start the emulator, but only with android15  for every version above that one, the emulator doesnt appear to start. Second, the emulator is much slower than when started from within Eclipse  for instance, one of my tests takes 1min on the Eclipse emulator, and about 34mins on the Jenkins emulator. Third, screenshots do not work at all, even without using the Use Host GPU option. Fourth, Im not able to launch the emulator with a window in fact, I do not want to in the long run, but it would be handy to see whats going on while setting up the build.p  pI tried to play with all kinds of plugin configurations including explicitly stating the emulator executable, e.g. emulator64x86, and I have also tried to reuse the AVD specification used by Eclipse, but that all wouldnt help. For the sake of completeness, I have attached my working Eclipse and plugin configurations below, but I guess that my actual question isp  pHow can I make the Android Emulator plugin start the emulator exactly the same way as Eclipse starts itp  pDespite that, I would of course be happy about all kinds of help  this is kind of driving me nuts p  pHeres a screenshot of the AVD configuration I use within Eclipsep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comnJwGF.png altScreenshot of AVD configp  pHeres the Jenkins output of my successfully starting emulatorp  precode[android] Using Android SDK homechrisandroidsdks [android] Creating Android AVD varlibjenkinsjobsPracticingTimer  Large Testsworkspace.androidavdhudsondeDE3201280x768android15x86.avd [android] homechrisandroidsdkstoolsandroid create avd f a c 256M s 1280x768 n hudsondeDE3201280x768android15x86 t android15 abi x86 [android] Setting hardware properties     hw.ramSize 512     vm.heapSize 64  homechrisandroidsdksplatformtoolsadb startserver [android] Starting Android emulator  homechrisandroidsdkstoolsemulator nobootanim ports 5593,5594 prop persist.sys.languagede prop persist.sys.countryDE avd hudsondeDE3201280x768android15x86 nosnapshotload nosnapshotsave nowindow  daemon not running. starting it now on port 5595   daemon started successfully  Failed to Initialize backend EGL display  homechrisandroidsdksplatformtoolsadb connect emulator5593 [android] Waiting for emulator to finish booting...  homechrisandroidsdksplatformtoolsadb s emulator5593 shell getprop dev.bootcomplete error device offline error device offline  homechrisandroidsdksplatformtoolsadb connect emulator5593  homechrisandroidsdksplatformtoolsadb s emulator5593 shell getprop dev.bootcomplete error device offline error device offline  homechrisandroidsdksplatformtoolsadb connect emulator5593  homechrisandroidsdksplatformtoolsadb s emulator5593 shell getprop dev.bootcomplete  homechrisandroidsdksplatformtoolsadb disconnect emulator5593  homechrisandroidsdksplatformtoolsadb connect emulator5593  homechrisandroidsdksplatformtoolsadb s emulator5593 shell getprop dev.bootcomplete  homechrisandroidsdksplatformtoolsadb s emulator5593 logcat v time  homechrisandroidsdksplatformtoolsadb connect emulator5593 [android] Emulator is ready for use took 48 seconds codepre  pHeres some failing Android Emulator plugin settings as text for brevityp  precodeRun emulator with properties   OS android19   Screen density 320   Screen resolution 1280x768   Device locale deDE   SD card size 128M   Target ABI x86   vm.heapSize64   hw.ramSize512   Reset emulator at startup   Show emulator window codepre  pAnd finally, heres the Jenkins output resulting from a failing emulator startp  precode[android] Using Android SDK homechrisandroidsdks [android] Setting hardware properties     vm.heapSize 64     hw.ramSize 512  homechrisandroidsdksplatformtoolsadb startserver [android] Starting Android emulator [android] Erasing existing emulator data...  homechrisandroidsdkstoolsemulator nobootanim ports 5749,5750 prop persist.sys.languagede prop persist.sys.countryDE avd hudsondeDE3201280x768android19x86 nosnapshotload nosnapshotsave wipedata SDL init failure, reason is No available video device  daemon not running. starting it now on port 5751   daemon started successfully  [android] Emulator did not appear to start giving up  homechrisandroidsdksplatformtoolsadb disconnect emulator5749 [android] Stopping Android emulator  homechrisandroidsdksplatformtoolsadb killserver Finished NOTBUILT codepre

I would like to do the most basic thing to start, which is to make a webpage display hello world, using python.  p  pIn Google App Engine this is fairly straightforward and is outlined a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comappenginedocspythongettingstartedpython27helloworld relnofollowherea.  p  pInside helloworld.py, something called webapp2, which has a a hrefhttpwebpython.codepoint.netwsgitutorial relnofollowweb server gateway interfacea.  When there is a request, there is a response with the HTTP header, content type, and the hello world message.p  precodeimport webapp2  class MainPagewebapp2.RequestHandler     def getself         self.response.headers[ContentType]  textplain         self.response.writeHello, World  application  webapp2.WSGIApplication[     , MainPage, ], debugTrue codepre  pIn another file app.yaml, there is a simple configurationp  precodeapplication yourappid version 1 runtime python27 apiversion 1 threadsafe true  handlers  url .   script helloworld.application codepre  pIn this way it is really simple to get up and running.  Is there a way to do an equivalent to this using AWSp  pTo start, needed to set up the instance, which was straightforward.  For my case, I decided to use Amazon Linux because it said python in the description, and used a t1 micro instance that would allow me to take advantage of the free tier services, which is great for my low power low bandwidth learning purposes.p  pThen, I was able to use the keyfile to log in just fine, which left me sitting at the command prompt. p  p[] python v p  precodePython 2.6.9 unknown, Mar 28 2014, 000637  [GCC 4.8.2 20131212 Red Hat 4.8.27] on linux2 Type help, copyright, credits or license for more information. dlopenusrlib64python2.6libdynloadreadline.so, 2 import readline  dynamically loaded from usrlib64python2.6libdynloadreadline.so gtgtgt 11 2 gtgtgt  codepre  pSo, I created the linux instance, was able to fire up python.  Now what are the steps I should take to get to hello world, as I did with Google App Engine  I should also note that webapp2 was not installed, and I suspect that other things I will want such as beautifulsoupbs4 arent either.p  pSo I needed to install some packages, and getting pip worked like a charmp  precodewget httppypi.python.orgpackagessourceppippip1.1.tar.gzmd562a9f08dd5dc69d76734568a6c040508 tar xvf pip.gz cd pip sudo python setup.py install codepre  pwebapp2 seems like it is for Google App Engine  is there something similar I should be usingp

Negative 5117 pIn our project were storing objects in a S3 bucket with versioning enabled. Theres no logic on the server besides creating a signed URI for the client to use. Wed like to keep it this way as we want the client to do all the processing.p  pTo the problem. Were successfully able to generate signed URIs for a GET and PUT object for the whole objects, but were unable to generate a URI for listing all available versions.p  pThis is an example of a GETurl on a object in one of our buckets which works the 992 are folders in the bucket a hrefhttpsbucketname.s3.amazonaws.com992AWSAccessKeyIdourkeyampSignaturesignatureampExpires1410784420 relnofollowhttpsbucketname.s3.amazonaws.com992AWSAccessKeyIdourkeyampSignaturesignatureampExpires1410784420ap  pAccording to the docs a hrefhttpdocs.aws.amazon.comAmazonS3latestAPIRESTBucketGETVersion.html relnofollowGET versionsa were supposed to append versions and the different versions.

If I read a hrefhttpdocs.aws.amazon.comAmazonS3latestdevRESTAuthentication.htmlConstructingTheCanonicalizedResourceElement relnofollowdocsa I interpret it as it shouldnt be included in the signature unless we append a value to it as well, which we arent. The problem is then that it doesnt matter if I then add it to the signature creation as it still fails with the error There is no such thing as the versions subresource for a key.p  pIs there someone who has successfully created a signed uri for object to list its versions Wed really love to get some pointers on what were doing wrong Id also like to point out that were not using the built in URIgenerator as we couldnt get it to fit our needs.p

Negative 5117 pI have a Java Swing interface with multiple codeJTextAreacodes and I am implementing an Edit menu with various different functions like Find, Copy, Paste, etc. When I click on the codeJMenuItemcode I need to know which codeJTextAreacode had the focus which is achievable through a codeTextActioncode I havent gone down the route of a codeFocusListenercode and keeping track of what last had the focusp  precodeJMenuItem miFind  new JMenuItemnew EditHandlerFind  class EditHandler extends TextAction    private String s  null    public EditHandlerString vs      supervs     s  vs       Override   public void actionPerformedActionEvent e      JTextComponent c  getFocusedComponent     if s.equalsFind        showFindDialogc          codepre  pThis works well and good but I want to be able to disable the Find codeJMenuItemcode under certain contexts i.e. if the specific codeJTextAreacode is disabled or is empty.

I need all those cases to come up with the same application. Moreover, all java applications like EditPad point to the JVM.p  pIs there something I can do with PID, like get both the application and company names, as shown in Procecss Explorer, under the Description and Company Name columns That would be perfect.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comjzSHk.png altenter image description herep

Negative 5117 pthis is my first stack post so please be constructive when reviewing my posting techniquep  pBasically, my problem is that I have an array of custom objects that I need to share with a today extension. The objects represent tasks in a todo list, and their properties are used to store info about each task name, location, dueDate, thumbnail, etc. The objects are stored in an array which is used to populate my todo list. All I want to do is pass this array to my widget so that I can populate a second tableview which will act as a condensed version of the first for the widget view. p  pI should point out that my widget is properly set up, as in I have properly linked it and the containing app together in groups. I have also successfully used NSUserDefaults to pass an array of NSStrings to the widget, however, when I try to pass the array of objects to the widget, it crashes and my log reads p  precode Terminating app due to uncaught exception NSInvalidUnarchiveOperationException, reason  [NSKeyedUnarchiver decodeObjectForKey] cannot decode object of class Xitem codepre  pI understand that this crash is related to archiving the object Xitem, which seems to be a necessary step towards saving custom objects in NSUserDefaults. However, I have tested savingloading the array within the same class of the containing app, and that works fine code belowp  precode        NSData encodedObject  [NSKeyedArchiver archivedDataWithRootObjectself.Xitems]         NSUserDefaults defaults  [[NSUserDefaults alloc] initWithSuiteNamegroup.AaronTest]         [defaults setObjectencodedObject forKeymyArray]         [defaults synchronize]           NSUserDefaults defaults2  [[NSUserDefaults alloc] initWithSuiteNamegroup.AaronTest]         NSData encodedObject2  [defaults2 objectForKeymyArray]         NSArray array2  [NSKeyedUnarchiver unarchiveObjectWithDataencodedObject2]          for Xitem t in array2              NSLog, t.itemName          codepre  pOkay so as explained, the above code works as expected. However, when i insert the second unarchiver half of this code into my today widget, i get the aforementioned error. Below is my code to show how I encodedecode the object it may be worth noting that this object was created for the simplicity of my debugging and only contains a NSString propertyp  pXitem.hp  precodeimport ltUIKitUIKit.hgt import ltFoundationFoundation.hgt   interface Xitem  NSObject ltNSCodinggt    NSString itemName   voidencodeWithCoderNSCoderencoder idinitWithCoderNSCoderdecoder  property NSString itemName  end codepre  pXitem.mp  precodeimport Xitem.h  implementation Xitem  synthesize itemName  voidencodeWithCoderNSCoderencoder   [encoder encodeObjectself.itemName forKeyiName]    idinitWithCoderNSCoderdecoder   self  [super init]  self.itemName  [decoder decodeObjectForKeyiName]  return self   end codepre  pI could also post my widget and containing app code, but it doesnt differ from the first set of code i posted apart from the renamed variables such as defaults2. I should point out that I really have exhausted resources while trying to solve this problem, but the fact that using NSKeyedArchiver solely in the containing app works, has left me stumped. p  pI realise that a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions26040261howdoiproperlypassansmutablearraytonsuserdefaultswithacustomdatamodthis posta is very similar to my own problem, but the author decides to opt for a workaround, whereas I would actually like to know why this doesnt work. Im a new developer and Im doing my best to pickup on the best working practices so any advice would be greatly appreciated. p  pI think its also possible to replace my object class with an NSDictionary However I would like to avoid this if possible because it would cause many conflicts in the main app, but obviously if that is the correct method I will tackle that problem. On a side note, if a dictionary would be better than an object for my requirements todo list with properties of UIImage, CLLocation, etc for any other reasons memory or accessibility for example please do elaborate and help me to understand why p  pMany thanks for anyones time p

Negative 5117 pI have a string that a user will type in representing time.  i.e 1005p  pIve been searching for a while, and cannot find a way to search this string to find a specific number.  The reason I need this number is because I need to take each number and use an algorithm to discover how much power it takes to display this number on a digital clock.  To do so, I need the frequency of each number.  For example if the time was 1005, the number 0 would occur 2 times, and I can take that 2 and multiply it by the necessary numbers to discover the power needed.p

Negative 5117 pI have a small Spring MVC project. Im writing MockMvc tests for it. Most of them work, but this one the first one Ive tried with a plain JSON body is giving me trouble. I keep getting a NullPointerException from deep within Spring. I tried debugging through it, but eventually ran out of attached Spring source code without getting any closer to an answer.p  pMy JSON block is captured from a live user test, which works fine. But in the test, it throws NPE. If I modify the JSON block to be malformed IE, add an extra comma somewhere, then it throws a 400 Bad Request, as expected. Remove the extra comma, go back to NPE. Making the block invalid IE, making a field null which is marked NotNull in my domain object does not give the expected 400 Bad Request.

I feel like it was attempting to stay on the index.php page when you clicked a link, but it still showed the dir it was suppose to follow. I am unsure but here the two files.

Negative 5117 pSay that I got a orderedlist with items, each item can be sorted up and down in this list. The first thought would be to have a SortOrder of intex 110.

If I place a new item at position 3 all items  3 would have to change there sortOrder.p  pSo to avoid this I could use larger intervalls for example  p  precodeN1  10 000 N2  20 000 N3  30 000 N4  40 000 N5  50 000 codepre  pIf N4 would be sorted up one level it would look like this  p  precodeN1  10 000 N2  20 000 N4  25 000 N3  30 000 N5  50 000 codepre  pMy question is how to handle this the best way in C What datatype should I use How do I avoid to regenerate the entire listwhen no sorting can be done anymore as often p  pMy own thought are to store it as a Decimal in both code and database.p

Negative 5117 pI am using Visual Studio 2013 to develop some custom components for one of the Windows Server 2012 roles, I also have latest Windws SDK installed. Some time ago, when I was doing the same thing for Windows Server 2008, with VS2010 and apporpriate SDK, I was able to use MGbg.exe debugger to catch some difficult bugs. Now I want to use the tool again, and it seems, that it does not come with eithe VS or SDK. Instead, when you search for the MDbg, you stumble upon this link a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms229861vvs.110.aspx relnofollowhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms229861vvs.110.aspxa, which says, taht it is a package in NuGet, however bottom of the page Remarks refers to MDbg.exe command line debugger. I tried installing the package, according to a hrefhttpwww.nuget.orgpackagesMDbg0.1.0 relnofollowhttpwww.nuget.orgpackagesMDbg0.1.0a, and it only does add some references to the project, also typing MDbg in package manager console just makes it hang there without doing anything or letting you do anything. And there seem to be no documentation whatsoever on how should you proceed if you want to get the same debugging experience as with MDbg.exe. So I guess my questions are 1. What is the way to get the same debudding experience as using MDbg.exe before or where and how do I get the latest MDbg version 2.

Negative 5117 pIt seems to me that Spring Data JPA was created primarily to allow easy query creation with query generation by method name. However, I need to create complex queries, and I cannot take advantage of the query generator. As such, Im stuck with calling findAll on a Specification that behind the scenes is using plain JPA criteria to build my query. Seems like I might as well drop Spring Data, thenp  pAre there any other technical benefits from Spring Data besides automated query generation that I couldnt get if I used, for example, Spring Boot with JPAp  pP.S.  I cannot directly use JPQL because my queries are dynamically created and must be typesafep

Negative 5117 pAs the title suggests, I want to know if Im doing things right or perhaps Ive dag myself a hole. p  pI have a large Winforms app in which Im using codeWindowsFormsSynchronizationContextcode class to execute code in a UI main thread regardless of what the current thread is. It is used whenever I need to access some part of the UI in the middle of another thread. You probably want to suggest just using BackgroundWorker but its only practical in most basic scenarios, bear with mep  pHeres how Im using the class in question code from Program.csp  precodestatic SynchronizationContext uiSyncCtx  [STAThread] static void Main      try               Store the class to a static variable         uiSyncCtx  new WindowsFormsSynchronizationContext       codepre  pAnd then I have this helper method also in Program.csp  precodepublic static void InvokeUiAsyncAction callback                 uiSyncCtx.Poststate gt              try                      callback.Invoke                  catch TargetInvocationException tiex                      HandleExceptiontiex.InnerException                  catch Exception ex                      HandleExceptionex                             , null  codepre  pThis helper method will enable me to run codecallbackcode delegate inside the Main thread. p  pI would typically use it like this code taken from some form or control classp  precodethis.Enabled  false this.ExecuteWithProgress gt      try              ...          catch BackendException bex               Some nonfatal exception happened, report to end user         MessageBox.Showbex.Message, Properties.Resources.SomeErrorResource, MessageBoxButtons.OK, MessageBoxIcon.Exclamation          catch Exception ex               Fatal exception, handle it         Program.HandleExceptionex          finally               Whatever happens, make sure UI is updated         Program.InvokeUiAsync gt                                                 this.Enabled  true                 ReflectChangesOnRestOfTheUI                    codepre  pNote that codeExecuteWithProgresscode is simply an extension method on codeControlcode class which enables me to execute a delegate strongin a new threadstrong while displaying animated progress somewhere on the Control itself until the Thread is gone.p  pAs you can see, codeInvokeUiAsynccode is a key player here, it enables me to update the UI from another thread. Above example is very simple demo, there are a lot more complex instances where codeInvokeUiAsynccode is called more often to update the UI.p  pAnd this works quite flawlessly so far, Ive never had problems with it. My concern is, Ive been doing things like this for a while now and Im also sure I found out about codeWindowsFormsSynchronizationContextcode from Stackoverflow long ago. p  pWhat bothers me now is, if this works so darn well, strongwhystrong would anyone ever want to use codeControl.BeginInvokecode approach instead Ive noticed people very often use it even though it relies on one or few controls where as with above approach you can update any part of the UI perfectly safely i.e. update a floating toolbar, properties window, enabledisable another window etc..p  pAre there any potential pitfalls in doing things this way that I may be missingp  pI have read up on this stuff on MSDN but Im still not smarter about it. Of course, I am aware of new parallel features in .Net 4.5 but Im still very interested in above questions.p  pThanks for taking time to read this and sorry for bad Englishp
Negative 5117 pGood afternoon,p  pThere is an error that has been occasionally occurring right after my project successfully builds. This error states Errors exist int he active configuration, proceed with Launch This error usually occurs after I get some errors in the build previously, fixclean them, and rebuild again. It occurs between the build and launching the debugger, because if I am disconnected from the remote system, it pops up before it attempts connecting to GDB.p  pThe project builds without issues, and if I restart eclipse, I am able to build and debug without a problem. The issue is that I end up losing all of my undo states and the general discomfort of having to restart eclipse all the time.p  pThis seems like strictly an eclipse issue, p  pThings Ive tried that have made no difference Cleaning the project, deleting files, etc. This seems to be a bug in eclispe,p  pIf anyone has any knowledge on how to get rid of this prompts, please advise,p  pThank you,p

Negative 5117 pDDD exposes bounded contexts, domain models, aggregates... but I often miss the keypoint of business rules. I would like to know how business rules integrate into this approach. Here is an example p  pImagine you have 2 bounded contexts in a credit company. One for debt recovery, the other for early refunds. These contexts embed real business specificities. In a conceptual point of view, I think these bounded contexts should separately embed common model parts, and similar domain model entities graph of 3 or 4 accountancy entities. Even if their respective models embed a common submodel we do not plan it can change, business rules that apply to these submodels are different. A DebtRecoveryService ensures rules are correctly applied, and another EarlyFundsService does the same, with specific accountancy rules. p  ul liShould this submodel be embedded and served to others by another dedicated bounded context if different business rules apply to them in terms of maths and respective behaviours .li liWhat defines an aggregate, is it only a part of a model li liDo specific business rules define specific aggregates  li ul  pemDo you think an aggregate should be considered only for the entity graph it represents, and be reused by other bounded contexts. Is it a good case for CQRS emp  pThanks,p

Negative 5117 hr  pTLDRp  pI need an Angular linking function to occur before a jQuery click event that is triggered on page redirect.p  hr  pI have an Angular directive that waits for a jQuery click event in its linking functionp  precode something like this link functionscope       angular.elementparentselector.onclick, buttonId            force digest since looking outside of Angular         scope.applyfunction                do some stuff that looks outside of Angular                  codepre  pMy goal is to make that stuff happen.  When I click the button, it does happen, and it makes me happy.  I can click it again and again and again, and the stuff happens I can reload the page and then click the button, and stuff still happens, and I am sufficiently satisfied.p  pWell, I also have a different button in a different view with a different URL than where the one that triggers the click event lives.  When this button is clicked, it redirects to the view with the Angular directive and the jQuery click event.  Upon redirect, it calls the jQuery click event to trigger the functionality that I so desire, but to no avail.  Now I am sad.p  precode something along these lines buttonId.triggerclick codepre  pUsing debugger and looking in Chrome dev tools I have been able to ascertain the followingp  ol lipWhen it works, and I am happy, it is because the Angular directives linking function loads first.  This makes sense, since the directive can set up the listener before the event triggers.pli lipWhen it doesnt work, and I am sad, it is because the Angular directives linking function loads after the jQuery click event triggers.  Note that it is still listening for the event, as any subsequent clicks of the button do trigger the stuff, as expected.pli ol  pBut that first trigger, the forced click on page redirect, is occurring before the linking function has an opportunity to listen for it.p  pAny thoughts, suggestions, questions  I know that this is a bit vague, and I apologize for that.  I would be happy to provide more details.  The key is to note that everything is working, with the exception of the timing of events.  I fully expect the stuff to happen as I desire if only, after the redirect, the Angular linking function can load before the click trigger.p

Negative 5117 pI am trying to implement a binary search tree in C, and following Cormen et al chapter 12 to do it.

An explicit conversion exists are you missing a castp blockquote  pFor this codeif newNode.key lt this.tree[x]code  line.br Is it illegal to use nullable types to acces an array indexbr Can I initialize the array maybe in a different way to allow itbr Or should I forget about null and use 1 for instancep

Negative 5117 pIm doing a final year project and it involves a MVC4 intranet application to be used for a real production company.p  pI have it working perfectly on the IIS express used in VS2012 and well tested. Now i have to do a demonstration of the application to the markers, would there be much difference from keeping it on localhost IIS express or would i be better to create a VM web server for the application. I dont want to be the latter if its practically the same as IIS express, so is there any advantages of one over the other i also thought about web hosting but that defeats the intranet purpose.p  pthanksp

For speed I dont mind preloading duplicate entries.pli lipThere are maybe 3x or more more associated codeCarocode in the list than there are codeEvaluatorscode, if that factors into things. pli lipPerformance is crucial, as mentioned above pli lipFor embonus pointsem, each cargo evaluator may have an additional codepenaltycode value associated with it, that is not dependent on how many codeAssociatescode a codeCargocode has. In other words if a row in the table above is looked up, I want to call codedouble EvaluatorgtAddPenalitycode strongonce and only oncestrong each time codeEvaluateCargocode is called.

Negative 5117 pI have an array codebetSlipcode, where I am doing some validation, lets say that the array has 4 indexes right now, every index has an codeinputcode so I have 4 inputs, one per index.p  pExample Values I type in the inputsp  blockquote   p1 input 10p      p2 input 10p      p3 input 10p      p4 input 10p blockquote  pThe next input can not be greater than the previous.

Negative 5117 pI have a somewhat intricate project setup consisting of several components that work together. Each component is a separate Python project that is hosted as a uWSGI application behind an Nginx proxy. The components interact with each other and with the outside world through the proxy.p  pI noticed myself about to cutandpaste some code from one component to another, as they perform similar functions, but interact with different services. Obviously, I want to avoid this, so I am going to pull out common functionality and put it into a separate library project, to be referenced by the different components.p  pI am running these apps in a virtual environment using virtualenv, so it should theoretically be easy to simple drop the library project into .envincludes.p  pHowever, I have a bit of a strange setup. First of all, I am running the project from varwww i.e. uWSGI hosts the apps from here, but the projects actually are present in another source controlled directory. For various reasons, I dont want to move them, so I created symlinks for the project directories in varwww. This works fine. However, now I have a potential problem, namely, where do I put the library project which is currently in the same directory as the other components, which I also want to symlinkp  pDo I symlink it in .envincludes And if so, how should I reference the library from my other components Do I reference it from sys.path or as a sibling directory Is NginxuWSGI with virtualenv following the symlinks and taking into account the actual directory or is it blindly assuming that everything is in varwwwp  pI have not tried either approach because there seems to be a massive scope for problems, so I wanted to get some input first. Needless to say, I am more than a little confused.p
