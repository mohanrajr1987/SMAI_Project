Positive 10393 pI fill a RecyclerView with a custom cursor adapter, which loads data from a database and works very well. Anyway, with user interaction, the database can become of some thousands of entries and the process of data load becomes very slow.

All the examples Ive found are based on Lists, but I think it would be an heavier solution to implement it too.p

Positive 10393 pIm using .Net c winforms. I want to move my mouse over another application and see the cusor X,Y position as I move the mouse over its interface. Displaying the X,Y on my forms title bar is ok. I want to see the X,Y location for a specific spot on this apps form.p  pThe reason I want to do this is because there are controls on this apps interface that I can mouse click on to turn a knob, one mouse click per knob turn. I want to write an app that I can position the mouse cursor to that specific X,Y position on this app form and then do a software mouse click to turn that same knob one turn. But I want to do this from my app, kind of like remote control I guess you could say. The other app knobs responds to mouse clicks when you are over the correct X,Y location.p  pThanks for any pointers in the right direction.p

Positive 10393 pAs far as I understand it you need to change the cursor in the codecallcode method of a codeTaskcode to be able to change the cursor properly. But in my application, I press a button and do something. And I do not want the application do to anything before this is done. I just want to inform the user that the the application is loading by changing the cursor.p  pProblem is that if I start a separate thread for the task, the rest of the program doesnt wait for that task to succeed. And if I put it in the same thread as the application I guess thats what Im doing, by doing codePlatform.runLatertaskcode, the cursor doesnt change.p  pThe method that is called when I press the button is a void method, so that prevents me from putting the return statement inside the tasks codesetOnSucceededcode method.p  pThe optimal scenario would be if I could just do thisp  precodeapp.getPrimaryStage returns the application stage.  void method  throws InterruptedException      app.getPrimaryStage.getScene.setCursorCursor.WAIT       Simulate execution of code that takes some time     Thread.sleep3000      app.getPrimaryStage.getScene.setCursorCursor.DEFAULT   codepre  pOr just create a task and execute it in the current thread, like this p  precodeapp.getPrimaryStage returns the application stage.  void method  throws InterruptedException      TaskltVoidgt task  new TaskltVoidgt          protected Void call              app.getPrimaryStage.getScene.setCursorCursor.WAIT               Simulate execution of code that takes some time             Thread.sleep3000              app.getPrimaryStage.getScene.setCursorCursor.DEFAULT              return null                     Platform.runLatertask    codepre  pBut none of these methods work. I can see that the cursor is changing underneath by doing this codeapp.getPrimaryStage.getScene.cursorProperty.addListenerobs, oldValue, newValue gt  System.out.printlnnewValue code But the change isnt showing unless I run the task in a separate thread. Why is this And what is the best way to force the program to wait for a task that is run by a separate threadp

Positive 10393 pIm Working with SQL Server and try to build a nested cursor. I know cursors arent the best way to do things, but I cant come up with any other solution.p  pSo the first Cursor is going through a temporary Table Flanschbreite an catches FlanschMin into a variable.

Negative 10393 pIve recently pushed a Django app live. We built the app in a staging subdomain on the server.

This is on modpython under Apache.p  pIve created unique SESSIONCOOKIENAME settings for both sites and Ive set SESSIONCOOKIEDOMAIN to .sitename.com for the live site and None for the staging site.p  pThe problem were seeing is users in the live admin are making edits that it appears are being saved to the staging site.

Negative 10393 pIm trying to build a sequence that determines the order to destroy objects. We can assume there are no cycles. If an object A uses an object B during its As construction, then object B should still be available during object As destruction. Thus the desired order of destruction is A, B. If another object C uses object B during its Cs construction as well, then the desired order is A, C, B. In general, as long as an object X is only destroyed after all other objects that used that object during their construction, the destruction is safe.p  pIf our destruction order so far is AECDBF, and we now are given an X we never know before hand what order the construction will initially happen in, its discovered on the fly, that uses C and F during its construction, then we can get a new safe order by putting X before whichever is currently earlier in the list, C or F happens to be C. So the new order would be ABXCDEF.p  pIn the context of the X example, a linked list seems unsuitable because a lot of linear scanning would be involved to determine which is earlier, C or F. An array will mean slow insertions which is going to be one of the more common operations. A priority queue doesnt really have a suitable interface, theres no, Insert this item before whichever one of these items is earliest we dont know the right priority before hand to make sure its inserted before the lower priority element and without disturbing other entries.p  pAll objects are constructed, desired order is computed, and the sequence will be iterated once and destructed in order. No other operations need to be done in fact, after using whatever data structure to determine the order, it could be copied into a flat array and discarded.p  pEdit Just to clarify, the first time an object is used is when it is constructed. So if A uses B, then E uses B, when E tries to use B it has already been created. This means a stack wont give the desired order. AB will become ABE when we want AEB.p  pEdit2 Im trying to build the order as I go to keep the algorithm in place. I would prefer to avoid building up a large intermediate structure and then converting that to a final structure. p  pEdit3 I made this too complicated pp

Negative 10393 pIm currently working on a legacy system using Oracles ADF Faces JSF implementation for the presentation layer.  The system relies on a rules engine to make certain form elements required, disabled, or even highlighted depending on the users interaction with them or values entered.p  pAt its current stage the application is working, sort of.  The current implementation handling the rules engine and the front end updates isnt very elegant and consists of a large set of if statements similar top  precodeifscreenObj instanceof CoreInputText      CoreInputText screenObj.setDisabledtrue  codepre  pTo complicate the mix we also have our own objects mixed in so the set as a whole does not share a common ancestor thus eliminating our option of doing something likep  precodeCommonAncestor screenObj.setDisabledtrue codepre  pThe question is whether or not it would be worth reworking this portion of the code to be cleaner and clearer.  Because the majority of the screen elements are ADF Faces elements were not ableallowed to change their ancestry to add additional methods.p  pThe goal of the code change would be two fold clean up older code and improve the code base so that the addition of new elements or controls wont result in a large code change specifically to the if statements which exist in numerous places.p  pSo if we go forward with this change which would be the better choice of achieving what were looking for  Subclassing all of the elements requiring a new class each time we utilize another preexisting control or implementing the decorator pattern  My only concern with the decorator is that it would still require a code change for each additional element.  Both options would appear to reduce the code changes since multiple methods containing these if blocks wouldnt need updating.p  pAny input on methods for handling such situations beyond subclassing and decorators is welcomep

Negative 10393 pI have a use case where I am serializing objects over the wire via MSMQ mostly strings. When I read the object off the queue I want to be able to tell if the user meant for the object to be a XML or a string.  I was thinking a good way to do this would just be to check the type.  If its XmlElement than it becomes XML data otherwise it becomes string or CDATA.  The reason I dont want to just check to see if the data is valid XML is that sometimes data will be provided that is supposed to be serialized as a string but is in fact valid XML.  I want the caller to be able to control the deserialization into string or XML.p  pAre there any types that are marked as serializable in the .NET Framework like XElement or XmlElement both which are not marked serializablep
Negative 10393 pWe have a need for multiple programs to call functions in a common library. The library functions access and update a common global memory. Each programs function calls need to see this common global memory. That is one function call needs to see the updates of any prior function call even if called from another program. For compatibility reasons we have several design constraints on how the functions exposed by the shared library must operatep  ul liAny data items both standard data types and objects that are declared globally must be visible to all callers regardless of the thread in which the code is running. li liAny data items that are declared locally in a function are only visible inside that function.li liAny standard data type or an instance of any class may appear either locally or globally or both. li ul  pOne solution is to put the librarys common global memory in named shared memory. The first library call would create the named shared memory and initialize it. Subsequent program calls would get the address of the shared memory and use it as a pointer to the global data structure. Object instances declared globally would need to be dynamically allocated in shared memory while object instances declared locally could be placed on the stack or in the local heap of the caller thread. Problems arise because initialized objects in the global memory can create and point to subobjects which allocate new additional memory. These new allocations also need to be in the shared memory and seen by all library callers. Another complication is these objects, which contain strings, files, etc., can also be used in the calling program. When declared in the calling program, the objects memory is local to the calling program, not shared. So the objects code needs to handle either case. It appears to us that the solution will require that we override the global placement new, regular new and delete operators. We found a design for a memory management system that looks like it will work but we havent found any actual implementations. If anyone knows of an implementation of Nathan Myers memory management design httpwww.cantrip.orgwave12.htmlseenIEPage1 I would appreciate a link to it. Alternatively if anyone knows of another shared memory manager that accommodates dynamically allocating objects I would love to know about it as well. Ive checked the Boost libraries and all the other sources I can find but nothing seems to do what we need. We prefer not to have to write one ourselves. Since performance and robustness are important it would be nice to use proven code. Thanks in advance for any ideashelp. p  pThanks for the suggestions about the ATL and OSSP libraries.  I am checking them out now although Im afraid ATL is too Wincentric if are target turns out to be Unix.p  pOne other thing now seems clear to us.  Since objects can be dynamically created during execution, the memory management scheme must be able to allocate additional pages of shared memory.  This is now starting to look like a fullblown heap replacement memory manager.p

Got me quite confused, but managed to narrow it down to a certain test class that was a partial class.p  pThe reason it was a partial class was that I had split a test class in two, just to make it a bit more clean. The class under test had a certain method that required a long range of tests and I thought it would be cleaner to have those in a separate file. But since there was one or two helper methods used I figured I could just make the class partial so both files still had access to those methods.p  pThe test framework is NUnit and the tests was run by using TestDriven.Net. Ran the tests both from inside a single test method reported two tests passed instead of one, on the class got twice the number of tests passed and on the whole test project.p  pManaged to fix the issue by making the classes not partial and just duplicating those tiny helper methods might move those to a separate helper class or something later.p  pNow... why on earth is this happening I thought partial classes were compiled into a single class Is this an issue with partial classes in general, NUnit, TestDriven.net or something completely differentp

Negative 10393 pI have a web app which loads an arbitrary page or file into an iFrame.p  pUnder some browsers, when pointing the iFrames src to a css file, instead of displaying the css text, a downloadopen file prompt appears.p  pIs there any way to prevent this I understand the valid security reasons for not downloading or opening a nontext file by default, but a css file or any text filetype should be safe enough safer than HTML in factp  pThe css files response header looks like the followingp  precodeContentType textcss charsetutf8 Status 304 Not Modified XPoweredBy Phusion Passenger modrailsmodrack 2.2.4 Etag 34b924980254e212b651bcae25da011e LastModified Thu, 04 Feb 2010 110159 GMT XRuntime 0.11366 Server nginx0.7.62  Phusion Passenger 2.2.4 modrailsmodrack ContentEncoding gzip  200 OK codepre  pNow I know I could use XHR instead of an iFrame to get the text and then display it, but in this application the content could conceivably be anything, determined by the user, at runtime, rather than a predefined set of pagesfiles. And it needs to be in an iFrame rather than loading an XHR response into a div in the parent window as the loaded page may have some javascript which relies on the correct location string such as analytics, ads, javascriptbased blogcomment systems, etc.p  pAnother other option would be XHR to work out the file type, then p  ul liset src attribute for iFrame if its HTML, orli licopy the response content into the iFrame if its plain textli lido nothing if binary fileli ul  pThe problem with that solution is that in the first case, Id end up needing to send two requests rather than just one. The advantage is that I can ignore binary files outright, though in this application it is doubtful that the user will try to load anything other than a HTML or other plain text page into the frame.p  pIm pretty sure theres not going to be a simple solution if any at all, but theres no better place to ask than here, so.....p  pstrongEdit 12Feb2010strongp  pBy the lack of answers, Im assuming my original assumption is correct no way to do this, if at all, thus the only solutions are either to ignore the problem altogether not ideal, or use my suggested method of XHR to determine response type and only load into frame if HTML. Again, this is not ideal, but if the browser cached the XHR response, this would make things a little better, sop  pDoes anyone know whether a browser would usually cache an XHR response so if the same url was subsequently loaded into an IFRAME the cached version would be used I realise this is browser and settings dependent, but would for example IE and Firefox with outofthebox settings do thisp

Negative 10393 pIm working on implementing different APIs in C and C and wondered what techniques are available for avoiding that clients get the encoding wrong when receiving strings from the framework or passing them back.

Also, I see the danger that codeWordcode gets extended with more and more utility functions like codelengthcode or codefromLatin1code or codesubstrcode etc. and Id rather not write Yet Another String Class. I just want a little container which avoids accidental encoding mixups.p  pI wonder whether anybody else has some experience with this and can share some useful techniques.p  pbEDITb In my particular case, the API is used on Windows and Linux using MSVC 6  MSVC 10 on Windows and gcc 3 amp 4 on Linux.p

Negative 10393 pI would like to implement a custom WindowsForms based control similar to the Visual Studio property grid. For this, albeit much simpler. I would ideally like to replicate the behavior of the IWindowsFormsEditorService interface, that is used to trigger inplace editing in the property grid by calling clientspecified UITypeEditor implementations.p  pAs a simpler exemple, I only need to implement editing a value via a simulated ComboBox or dropdown list in a cell. The way Visual Studio does it does involve a real ComboBox control. Rather, Visual Studio displays a little dropdown button on the right of the cell which, when pressed, triggers the display and operations of a simple ListBox control, positioned in such a way as to simulate the ComboBox being dropped down.p  pI understand that for this to happen, I somehow need to implement my own modal message loop when editing is taking place. However, I have some trouble understanding how and where to put this message loop. I also have issues with the dropdown list expanding past the boundaries of my custom control.p  pIm very proficient in COM and C but I would like to implement a pure Cbased solution for this.p  pWhat would be a good way to implement a simple simulated CombBox InPlace editing in a custom gridlike controlp

Negative 10393 pI know codestaticcode is an overloaded keyword in C.  Here, Im only interested in its use as a keyword to enforce internal linkage. p  pIf you have a global variable declared in a code.ccode file, what is the difference between using codestaticcode and not using codestaticcode  Either way, no other code.ccode file has access to the variable, so the variable is basically private to the file, with or without the static keyword. p  pFor example, if I have a file codefoo.ccode, and I declare a global variablep  pcodeint x  5codep  pThat variable codexcode is only available to code inside codefoo.ccode unless of course I declare it in some shared header file with the codeexterncode keyword.  But if I dont declare it in a header file, what would be the difference if I were to typep  pcodestatic int x  5code.p  pEither way, it seems codexcode has internal linkage here.  So Im confused as to the purpose of codestaticcode in this regard.p

Negative 10393 pAgain, asking MVC noob questions.  Forgive my lack of experience.p  pI have a situation where I am using an MVC route to return a large XML file.  Sometimes it can be very large.  Currently, Im using a StringBuilder to build the XML output I want, and then returning it like thisp  precodevar sb  new StringBuilder XmlObject.WriteXmlsb return Contentsb.ToString, textxml, Encoding.UTF8 codepre  pWhat Im running into is that for various reasons the XML blog can take quite a long time to generate.p  pWithin the XmlObject.WriteXml method are calls to tons of other little methods that output bits and pieces of XML as they are called, so I START building an XML string right away, it just takes a while to finish.  Each of these methods accepts a StringBuilder as an argument, so can created one and then pass it all over the place, using sb.Append within each little method to build the final XML blob.p  pOK, so what Id LIKE to do is start returning something to the client as soon as the string begins to build.  In Webforms, I would have replaced all the StringBuilder paramaters with HttpResponse and used HttpResponse.Write instead of StringBuilder.Append, in a fashion similar to thisp  precodethis.Response.BufferOutput  false XmlObject.WriteXmlResponse codepre  pThen as each little piece of XML got written to the Reponse, the text would be sent to the client.p  pThe problem Im having is that the ActionResult has to have a return statement.  I dont know how to treat in a similar fasion using an MVC route and ActionResult.  Perhaps I need to be using something other than an ActionResultp  pThanks everybodyp

Negative 10393 pAfter debugging a particularly tricky issue in VB.NET involving the order in which instance variables are initialized, I discovered that there is a breaking discrepancy between the behavior that I expected from C and the actual behavior in VB.NET.p  psupstrongNota benestrong This question concerns a slight discrepancy in the behaviors of VB.NET and C. If youre a language bigot that is unable to provide an answer other than emthats why you should use C, noobem, there is nothing for you to see here kindly move along.supp  pSpecifically, I expected the behavior outlined by the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryaa645605.aspxC Language Specificationa emphasis addedp  blockquote   pWhen an instance constructor has no constructor initializer, or it has a constructor initializer of the form codebase...code, that constructor implicitly performs the initializations specified by the variableinitializers of the instance fields declared in its class. strongThis corresponds to a sequence of assignments that are executed immediately upon entry to the constructor and before the implicit invocation of the direct base class constructor.strong The variable initializers are executed in the textual order in which they appear in the class declaration.p blockquote  pContrast that with the portion of the VB.NET Language Specification concerning a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryAa711964Instance Constructorsa, which says emphasis addedp  blockquote   pWhen a constructors first statement is of the form codeMyBase.New...code, the constructor implicitly performs the initializations specified by the variable initializers of the instance variables declared in the type. strongThis corresponds to a sequence of assignments that are executed immediately after invoking the direct base type constructor.strong Such ordering ensures that all base instance variables are initialized by their variable initializers before any statements that have access to the instance are executed.p blockquote  pstrongThe discrepancy here is immediately obvious.strong C initializes classlevel variables embeforeem calling the base constructor. VB.NET does exactly the reverse, apparently preferring to call the base constructor embeforeem setting the values of instance fields.p  pIf you want to see some code, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions711586whycisalwayswinningovervbnetthis related questiona provides a more concrete example of the divergent behavior. Unfortunately, it does not provide any hints as to how one might coerce VB.NET into following the model established by C.p  pIm less interested in why the designers of the two languages chose such divergent approaches than I am in possible workarounds for the problem. Ultimately, my question is as follows strongIs there any way that I can write or structure my code in VB.NET to force instance variables to be initialized embeforeem the base types constructor is calledstrong, as is the standard behavior in Cp

Negative 10393 pHeres the thingp  pI have a simple WPF Windows application, in which Ive included a codeTreeViewcode, which is being constructed with the help of codeHierarchicalDataTemplatecode and fed with some hierarchical data.p  pThe hierarchical data structure is made of FakeRec class, which contains child items in a codeListltFakeRecgtcode. Each item contains a Title string property. So in my XAML, I havep  precode... ltHierarchicalDataTemplate ItemsSourceBinding Items DataTypexType localFakeRecgt ...      ltTextBlock Grid.Column0 TextBinding PathTitlegt ... ltHierarchicalDataTemplategt ... codepre  pThis works fine, and in the generated codeTreeViewcode I see the title of each node.p  pNow I want to make this whole tree localizable. I have my resources in FakeDirResources.Resx in a separate assembly, but that does not matter. If I do thisp  precode... ltHierarchicalDataTemplate ItemsSourceBinding Items DataTypexType localFakeRecgt ...     ltTextBlock Grid.Column0 TextBinding PathTitle, SourceStaticResource FakeDirResourcesgt ... ltHierarchicalDataTemplategt ... codepre  pMy tree is blank obviously, because in my codeFakeDirResources.resxcode file I dont have a resource with key codeTitlecode, but I need to use the codeTitlecode of the other binding, resolve it through the resources, and then somehow bind the result to the tree.p  pNote that if i just place a codeTextBlockcode on the window, without relation to the tree or to the codeHierarchicalDataTemplatecode, I can bind it without problem to the resources, like sop  precodeltTextBlock TextBinding Pathgames, SourceStaticResource FakeDirResourcesgt codepre  pThis works great, fetching the string, and if I change the codeSystem.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulturecode and refresh my provider, this string gets changed to to the new language.p  pThe question is how do I combine the two What am I missing I guess there has to be some trick and with my short experience with WPF its probably not a straightforward trick.p  pCheersp  pAlon.p

Negative 10393 pI have an app that is working, but Im not happy that Ive got the best or simplest solution in place. The app has a single database with a number of tables with typical onetomany references. So far so good and nothing unusual.p  pThe app has 3 tabs, each one can display a list of records from one of the tables. If a user touches a table row the navigation view on the tab then pushes a new table view showing the details. Think of you address book and you get the idea.p  pOn the details view of a record Ive got sections containing the links to records in the other tables. So touching one will navigate to that record, changing to the appropriate tab. p  pThe tricky bit is when editing a record, because it can affect the data displayed on another tab. Originally I looked into performing updates to table views based on the core data changes sent through from the core data saved notifications. However I found that working out what changes needed to be made to a table view based on that was too difficult and unreliable. mainly because I dont have a before and after data graph to compare. So currently when a core data save happens, the table views just remember that their backing data may have been affected and they do a full reload on next display. p  pWhilst my system works for keeping the data in sync across the table views, Im sure there must be a better way. Im considering whether KVO might be the better option with table view controllers tracking individual fields and objects within the data graph so they can respond to precise changes triggered by other table views. The core data notifications approach feels a bit like a hammer approach to a problem that needs a subtle tap. p  pHow have others dealt with this sort of issuep

Negative 10393 pmy question is probably again pretty simple, but I did not find anything. I am writing a Linux Security Module. As you might know the struct inode in the kernel contains one field isecurity to save security relevant information for the LSM. Now just to make sure Is it safe to assume that no user not even root will be able to read or write this value, i.e. can this value really be accessed only from kernel spacep  pThe reason for my question is, that it is obvious that some inode data can be accessed from userspace through systemcalls I guess, but still using chmod etc. you are able to change some values in an inode and now I wonder if that doesnt mean, that all inode data also the isecurity can be accessed from user space somehow.p  pCheersp

Negative 10393 pI am building a small application in Flash CS5, and I have run into a problem. I have imported a rather complex Adobe Illustrator file, created by a designer, into my application. This file is full of all kinds of images, text, and other components which I can manipulate inside of Flash.p  pThere is one component in my application, consisting of a group containing a basic square with text on top of it, that I would like to make into a hotspot, which a user can mouse over and trigger a tooltip to display. I have converted this entire group into a MovieClip, which will trigger the tooltip to display on MOUSEOVER. Its only choking point is when the user triggers it.p  pFor some reason, whenever I move my pointer over different areas of the MovieClip, the MOUSEOVER event is called several times. For example, mousing over the background fires it once, then mousing over different areas of the text will fire it several times, even though all of these components are grouped together inside of one MovieClip.p  pHow can I cause these objects to behave as one MovieClip, so that mousing over any area of the MovieClip will only fire the MOUSEOVER event listener oncep

Negative 10393 pMy program involves a number of JAVA threads calling a KornShell ksh script file with different parameters. This script file in turn calls some SQL commands  which return some status. I store this status in a variable as a part of the script and check the value returned from SQL and take appropriate actions.  The problem is that all scripts are being executed in the same session and thereby the variable name gets shared across all threads. Since these threads are working asynchronously, I want this link to be broken. The easiest solution that I could come up with was to have a different variable for each thread use some input parameter to the script as an identifier but this would mean that the name of that variable needs to be dynamic. That is, I should be able to use the value of a variable in the name of another variable. Is this even possible If it is then how do I do it p  pJava Thread           Same session                             Java Thread          Same Script                              Java Thread         Same var name                           br Java Thread          This same var                  name can cause   Java Thread           Inconsistenciesp  pIf not, then can anyone suggest an alternative approach An important aspect of this is the far that the JAVA part is a server program and will be running for extended durations so I will need to unset these variables manually.

Editing it is generally OK.p  pIm happy that it takes a while to load the xaml when debugging. However when I remove the debug point I expect it to run fast again. This is not happening.

As soon as I add a debug point, even though I later remove it, it runs unbelievably slow.p  pI am part of a development team and I have a slow running Master.xaml and a teammate has a slow running GeneralLedger.xaml.

However, if I delete any files and then add new ones, things get strange.  Heres an example...p  pImagine that Ive started with an empty directory, and added four files to it.  The array returned by listFiles will bep  pPosition 0  File 4 fourth to be addedbr P 1  File 3br P 2  File 2br P 3  File 1brp  pThen, Ill delete Files 2 and 3.

Negative 10393 pIn my project I am building a Java execution framework that receives work requests from a client. The work varying size is broken down in to a set of tasks and then queued up for processing. There are separate queues to process each type of task and each queue is associated with a ThreadPool. The ThreadPools are configured in a way such that the overall performance of the engine is optimal.p  pThis design helps us load balance the requests effectively and large requests dont end up hogging the system resources. However at times the solution becomes ineffective when some of the queues are empty and their respective thread pools sitting idle.p  pTo make this better I was thinking of implementing a worktask stealing technique so that the heavily loaded queue can get help from the other ThreadPools. However this may require implementing my own Executor as Java doesnt allow multiple queues to be associated with a ThreadPool and doesnt support the work stealing concept.p  pRead about ForkJoin but that doesnt seem like a fit for my needs. Any suggestions or alternative way to build this solution could be very helpful. p  pThanks Andyp

Negative 10393 pHow quickly does Android go to sleep after emwakelockem is releasedp  pI am working on an app which uses the accelerometer in the background, and because of its high power consumption I am investigating how best to allow the device to go to sleep, at least for every other minute or so.p  pI cannot let the device go to sleep for as long as an hour, or even 10 minutes  that would be only possible in the case where I would develop some kind of intelligent scheduler based its predictions of user behavior.  I do not have enough time for this.p  pstrongThus I am asking if when I let my app go to sleep, and actually unregister the sensor update listener, would the device even go to sleep in such a small time intervalstrong  I would think that there would be some timeout to prevent runnning all that stuff that is necessary when device goes out of standby mode.p  pI am using the slowest accelerometer mode codeSENSORDELAYNORMALcode. Right now, my service holds the device on emwakelockem all the time. This only lasts for about 12 hours of standby  getting twice as much would be sufficient.p

Negative 10393 pIm building a MVC3 EF Code First application on an SQLExpress DB. It is very important to me that databases are autogenerated whenever the schema changes or something like that.  Now I am adding authentication to my application, and I looked into the Authentication framework that comes with MVC. However, as it appears it requires me to run aspnetregsql.exe every time a new database is generated. I really need the Authentication tables to be in the same database as my application database. p  pIm basically wondering what my options arep  ul liIs it possible to use the authentication framework and have it auto generated in the same way as the Entity framework generates my other datali liIf not it would be ok for me to write my own authentication, however are there still parts that I can use in other words, do I need to write a custom membership provider or anything like that I would like to keep using the attributes [authenticate] etc.li ul  pI could use some pointers in the right direction.p

Additionally confusing is during restart, apache complains if httpd.conf has syntax errors but then doesnt seem to be acting on the contents.p  pAm I wrong to think that httpd.conf will be reread upon server restart Is there a harder restart A few times I executed apachectl without sudo  is it possible that this put apache to an inconsistent statep  pHave spent time with apache and modrewrite docs. Im guessing Im using apache badly somehow, but have no guess as to how that might be.p  pAll comments greatly appreciated.p

The scenario is if administrator wants to change the password it will not check any old password, while for user it will check old password, if it is correct then set the new password. I have taken two requiredfiledvalidator controls for old password and new password field and comparevalidator control to check confirm password. p  pI have assigned groupA for old password required field validator, and groupB for new and confirm password. The scenario is for admin login I hides old password as it is not required and for user login I makes it visible. p  pSo problem here is that for user login submit event I want to validate both groupA and groupB. Any Idea p

Negative 10393 pright now I am trying to make a website a hrefhttptaylortomasini.meprojects relnofollowPortfolioa and I am running into a problem.  On the page in the link there is going to be quite a lot of content so I researched and made the side tabs which combine anchors and javascript to show only the selected section.  The problem I am now running into is that this method works when the content is small, but in the coding section I was experimenting and noticed that the content did not cause the parent div to expand when the content was more then 100. I know this is due to the displaynone usability.  I have tried to use visibilityhidden and toggle that, but the problem is that then the height of the total content is calculated for each page which I do not want.  Any help would be amazing D ps. i do not wish to use jQuery if possible This is my first post ever so I am sorry if this is too much information I just wanted to give as much as I could.p  pHTML

Negative 10393 pMaybe I should have asked this way earlier...p  pI have a DIV that loads all items from a sql table. Then I have some checkboxes that will be used to filter by color, so if a user picks BLUE the DIV will be reloaded passing BLUE as the color and showing only BLUE items.p  pOnce the user clicks, I would like to show a loading .gif during the time elapsed while loading the BLUE items. Maybe its super short or maybe it takes 3 seconds or so...p  pMy options arep  ul lipHaving another DIV inside my main DIV that contains the .gif and is CSS non displayed. Then with a JQUERY I would have to display it and then hide it... If this option is good, what kind of JQUERY could i usepli lipUsing a JQUERY to .load the Loading DIV before I load the results after filteringpli ul  pThanksp

Negative 10393 pIm trying to load an image asynchronously using jquery javascript framework. The loaded image should be faded in when its completely downloaded to local page. By now Im able to asynchronously load an image and fade it in after a constant time not when its completely downloaded. This produces some graphical errors while fading if image is tall and download takes a moment of time because of image size. Also the memory allocated by the browser is increasing step by step when a image is loaded asynchronously. Even the same images shown before allocates new memory.p  pHow can I load an image  asynchronously and do some fading when its completely downloaded. And how do I have to load the image to get no memory leak in my browser.p  precodeltDOCTYPE html PUBLIC W3CDTD XHTML 1.0 TransitionalEN httpwww.w3.orgTRxhtml1DTDxhtml1transitional.dtdgt lthtml xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtmlgt  ltheadgt    ltmeta charsetutf8gt    lttitlegtjQuery demolttitlegt  ltheadgt  ltbodygt    ltscript srcjquery1.8.0.min.jsgtltscriptgt    ltscript srcjquery.timer.jsgtltscriptgt     ltscript srcjquery.center.jsgtltscriptgt     ltlink relstylesheet typetextcss hrefstyle.css mediascreen gt    ltdiv classhidegt        ltimg idbild height100 srclogo.jpg altLogo gt    ltdivgt    ltscriptgt     var timer  .timerfunction               var img  bild.attrsrc,httplocalhosttest.phpnew Date.getTime.loadfunction                               if this.complete  typeof this.naturalWidth  undefined  this.naturalWidth  0                      bild.attrsrc,logo.jpg Show logo in error case                  else                      div.hide.appendimg                             .stoptrue,true.fadeIn1000.delay3000.fadeOut1000           bild.errorfunction                  bild.attrsrc,logo.jpg          timer.set time  5000, autostart  true     ltscriptgt    ltbodygt  lthtmlgt codepre

Negative 10393 pI have specific need for settings setup, where I have list with 4 options Age, Height, Weight and Gender.

When item 1 is selecte, it would display layout1.xml and call function1 from Settings class.p  pItem2 calls layout2.xml and calls function2 from Settings class.p  pIs this good approach, or should I create class for every frame, and have small GenderSelector class that actually does nothing but handles radio buttonp

If there is a way to tell windows XP and later to start a service emafterem network driver is loaded, my problem is solved. Any hint is really appreciated.p

Negative 10393 pIve been developing a PHP application using the Zend framework for awhile on a Linuxbased hosting provider, and its gone along more or less swimmingly.p  pThe time has come to be able to develop locally on my Mac, so I configured Apache to run PHP, grabbed the source code, and symlinked LibraryWebServerDocuments to the public folder in my Zend web app.p  pThat was fine. The controllers were executing and loading the correct scripts, which seemed to parse and render correctly. Except, I wasnt able to connect to my local MySQL database. I realized that I hadnt copied etcphp.ini.default to etcphp.ini, so I went ahead and did that. I then updated this line     pdomysql.defaultsockettmpmysql.sock and restarted Apache. Now, suddenly, none of the PHP executes. Instead, the raw PHP is sent back to the browser.p  pThe effect is more or less the same as if I was trying to load a .php file directly with an Apache instance that didnt recognize the .php file extension. Based on what Ive experienced, Im guessing that maybe somewhere in php.ini there is a setting that is causing this to happen when I rename php.ini and restart Apache, the scripts once again parse and render correctly, but again I cant hit the database but Im not sure where to look. Does anyone have any thoughtsp

Negative 10393 pWe have an issue with the field readonly behaviour in Orbeon Forms. We usually write conditions in the bind definitions to tell when a field should be readonly, so when the condition is met, the field on the formHTML browser will not be editable. p  pHowever, in the HTML Page source of the field we see that the field holds up the property disableddisabled but not readonlyreadonly. Because of the property disableddisabled the data in the input field will be shown in grey colorstrongIE Browser, windows default appearancestrong and it looks blurreddull and hence is not viewable correctly.  Also we cannot change the color of the input data by css properties for disabled fields, but we can do for fields having property readonlyreadonly.p  pSo the question is when we say readonlytrue in bind definition in Orbeon code, is it possible to get property as readonlyreadonly instead of disableddisabled for a field on the HTML browserp  pSample Orbeon Code and HTML page source snapshot is belowp  precodeltxhtmlhtml xmlnsxformshttpwww.w3.org2002xforms     xmlnsfhttporbeon.orgoxfxmlformatting     xmlnsxhtmlhttpwww.w3.org1999xhtml     xmlnsxxformshttporbeon.orgoxfxmlxforms     xmlnsevhttpwww.w3.org2001xmlevents     xmlnsxsdhttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchema     gt      ltxhtmlheadgt         ltxformsmodel xmlnsxformshttpwww.w3.org2002xforms                 xmlnsxshttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchema idmainmodelgt            ltxformsinstance idforminstancegt             ltformgt               ltfield1gtltfield1gt               ltfield2gtltfield2gt               ltfield3gtltfield3gt             ltformgt           ltxformsinstancegt            ltxformsinstance idformattributesgt             ltattributesgt                 ltsummarygtfalseltsummarygt             ltattributesgt           ltxformsinstancegt            ltxformsbind idsummary nodesetinstanceformattributessummary gt           ltxxformsvariable namesummary selectinstanceformattributessummary gt            ltxformsbind nodesetinstanceforminstance readonlysummarytrue gt            ltxformsbind idfield1 nodesetinstanceforminstancefield1 gt           ltxformsbind idfield2 nodesetinstanceforminstancefield2 gt           ltxformsbind idfield3 nodesetinstanceforminstancefield3 gt          ltxformsmodelgt     ltxhtmlheadgt      ltxhtmlbodygt        lttablegt         lttrgt             lttdgt                 ltxformstrigger appearanceminimal idreadonlyviewgt                     ltxformslabelgtReadonly Viewltxformslabelgt                     ltxformsaction eveventDOMActivategt                         ltxformssetvalue bindsummary valuetrue gt                     ltxformsactiongt                 ltxformstriggergt             lttdgt             lttdgt                 ltxformstrigger appearanceminimal ideditableviewgt                     ltxformslabelgtEditable Viewltxformslabelgt                     ltxformsaction eveventDOMActivategt                         ltxformssetvalue bindsummary valuefalse gt                     ltxformsactiongt                 ltxformstriggergt             lttdgt         lttrgt         lttrgt             lttdgt                 Field 1              lttdgt             lttdgt                 ltxformsinput bindfield1 idfield1id xxformsmaxlength10 gt              lttdgt         lttrgt         lttrgt             lttdgt                 Field 2              lttdgt             lttdgt                 ltxformsinput bindfield2 idfield2id xxformsmaxlength10 gt              lttdgt         lttrgt         lttrgt             lttdgt                 Field 3              lttdgt             lttdgt                 ltxformsinput bindfield3 idfield3id xxformsmaxlength10 gt              lttdgt         lttrgt       lttablegt      ltxhtmlbodygt ltxhtmlhtmlgt codepre  pSnap shot of the HTML page sourcep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com8PA80.png altenter image description herep

Negative 10393 pI have a UITableView with a navigation bar on top. I have several text fields in the cells and if i click in the cell at the bottom the keyboard hides the text field. So I googled and found this link a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationStringsTextFontsConceptualTextAndWebiPhoneOSKeyboardManagementKeyboardManagement.htmlapplerefdocuidTP40009542CH5SW7 relnofollowhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationStringsTextFontsConceptualTextAndWebiPhoneOSKeyboardManagementKeyboardManagement.htmlapplerefdocuidTP40009542CH5SW7ap  pI used exactly that code and run my app again. Now it scrolls up about the height of the keyboard instead of scrolling down. Also it scrolls in every cell, even the cells at the top which will not get hided by the keyboard. Does anyone have a solution for this I tried to log out some coordinates inside the keyWasShown method but its very complex for me to figure it out.p
Negative 10393 pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pWe have a CVB.net client application consuming a WCF service which connects to an Oracle database. The web service connects to the database using the .NET frameworks data provider for Oracle not to be confused with ODP. Our testers have experienced sporadic Oracle account locking which seems to happen shortly after changing the users Oracle password. The dbaaudittrail logs have revealed what seem to be automated connection attempts at very regular intervals i.e. every two minutes on the dot without any user or client activity. Numerous logs IIS, WCF tracing, message logging, etc. have confirmed these connection attempts are not initiated directly by the client application they must be coming independently from the web service or from inside the System.Data.OracleClient library. The automatic attempts continue forever until the web services worker process single worker dies from inactivity.p  pIn some instances, these automatic attempts get started before the password change, and they connect successfully to the database, but as soon as the password changes, the next attempt fails for invalid usernamepassword. After three attempts, the account gets locked. We are trying to find the source of these periodic connection attempts.p  pI found a very similar, but unanswered, problem on Oracles forum a hrefhttpsforums.oracle.comforumsthread.jspathreadID1114009 relnofollowherea.p  pstrongCurrent Thoughtsstrongp  pOur latest investigations have led us to believe it is an unexpected behavior from connection pooling. If the user connected to the web service before the password change, a connection pool would be created for the original connection string. After changing the password and logging back into the web service, the data provider would create a new connection pool based on the new connection string.p  pCould something inside the data provider be trying to keep the old connection alive from the first connection pool Perhaps the first connection pool is discarding the old connection and attempting to replenish it with a new one with the now invalid connection string. What could cause this Note we are using the default settings for minmax pool size 0100.p  pWe do not believe our code is directly attempting to access a connection from the first connection pool. The users session does not have any memory of the previous sessions password, and therefore would not be using the old connection string to reference the first connection pool. Additionally, nothing in our code would explain the very precise connection intervals we are seeing.p

Negative 10393 pMy app needs floating palette windows. Ive already implemented this behavior on my own and it worked great for when it was a single document app, but now my app requires multiple document windows.

Negative 10393 pCan someone help me with a big question When doing webbased application development, why does everyone insist upon creating local versions of the server environment for development Why not just develop on a hosted server It seems like a serious pain to try to recreate and keep synchronized the entire server environment locally  especially on a variety of boxes and platforms that dont match the hosted environment anyway. It seems much simpler to create a testing environment remotely and work with files in that environment via FTP.p  pAnd yet all the SVN services and tools Ive found are designed to pull copies onto a given local machine, treating the remote server as a deployment.p  pI want to set up a remote development environment  so developers can check out their own version of the files they need into their personal file tree on the emserverem. When theyre done testing in their own little environment they can commit via SVN to a single staging environment, test again there, and then copy the files from development to production. Where can I find the tool to help me set up and manage something like thisp

In essence which JavaScript engine to use is just an implementation detail and any JSengine couldve been used, or even an abstraction to work with various JSengines.p  pa hrefhttpjoyent.com relnofollowJoyenta probably chose V8 because its open source, has favourable licensing terms, and is usually the fastest JS engine out there but I believe its been overtaken at times by other engines.p  pGiven that its a good thing to have multiple different but compatible implementations of many things that might be called open standards, such as JS engines, web browsers, compilers for programming languages, etc surely its also good to have multiple implementations of a serverside platform like node.jsp  pFor example there are JavaScript engines that run on just about every operating system and hardware, but V8 only exists for a couple of them. It even turns out that Microsoft is promoting node.js for Windows Azure even though it depends on a major rivals work and even though they have their own JS engine which can compete with V8 for speed.p  pIf any such ports have begun I would be very interested in following their progress to monitor whether node.js might become an open standard.p  hr  psupbull I realize node is not standardized like JS and browsers are and that its evolving very rapidly, but that never stopped anyone scratching an itch. bull If there are more than one port Im not asking for opinions on which you think is better or which is more popular, this is not a poll question. bull Im also not shopping for a node.js implementation, Im interested in whether node.js or something like it might be universally adopted as a platform, or whether it will remain in the hands of a single company.supp

Negative 10393 pWhat is the proper way to transform surface normals defined in world space to normals in screen space I dont think they can simply be multiplied by the projection matrix, because perspective division transforms things into clip space and as far as I understand, in this space planes that are coplanar to the image plane remain coplanar.p  pBut the transformation Im looking for should result in transformed normals such that the blue world normals depicted in graphic A should result in differing screenspace normals because, even though their planes are coplanar to the image plane, they do not face the camera  on the other hand the depicted normals in graphic B should after the transformation be more or less equal, since their surfaces face the camera.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comdfXZk.gif altenter image description herep  pWhat transformation am I looking for how to calculate itp  pI need this for some screenspace effects.p

Negative 10393 pWhere I currently work we are considering upgrading from TFS 2010 to TFS 2012. One feature that I quite like is Gated Checkins, as this ensures that the branch you are developing in remains pristine in terms of there being no checkinschangesets that cause the build to break  due to compilation errors or failed unit tests.p  pHowever in TFS 2010 many of the developers and I found this feature a bit cumbersome to use. One usability problem was in regards to the need to reconcile your workspace after the CI build has successfully validated that your checkin does not break the build. Another issue was if your changeset did break the build the developers did not find it intuitive to unshelve the broken changeset.p  pHas the Gated CheckIn experience been improved in TFS 2012 The one improvement that I have found by researching on the Internet is the ability to queue up a number of checkins prior to invoking a CI build. Apart from that I have not found any further information, especially in regards to the developeruser experience of this feature.p

Negative 10393 pI have an application that wants to keep open many files periodically it receives a client request saying add some data to file X, and it would be ideal to have that file already opened, and the files header section already parsed, so that this write is fast. However, keeping open this many files is not very nice to the operating system, and could become impossible if our datastorage needs grow.p  pSo I would like a give me this file handle, opening if its not cached function, and some process for automatically closing files which have not been written to for, say, five minutes. For the specific case of caching file handles which are written to in short spurts, this is probably enough, but this seems a general enough problem that there ought to be functions like give me the object named X, from cache if possible and Im now done with object X, so make it eligible for eviction five minutes from now. p  pa hrefhttpsgithub.comclojurecore.cachecore.cachea looks like it might be suitable for this purpose, but the a hrefhttpclojure.github.comcore.cachedocumentationa is quite lacking and the a hrefhttpsgithub.comclojurecore.cacheblobmastersrcmainclojureclojurecorecache.cljsourcea provides no particular clues about how to use it. Its TTLCache looks promising, but as well as being unclear how to use it relies on garbage collection to evict items, so I cant cleanly close a resource when Im ready to expire it. p  pI could roll my own, of course, but there are a number of tricky spots and Im sure I would get some things subtly wrong, so Im hoping someone out there can point me to an implementation of this functionality. My code is in clojure, but of course using a java library would be perfectly fine if thats where the best implementation can be found.p

Rather, Im saving a reference to arg2 and assigning the value indirectly later on.p  pThe trick is ... I dont want to have to do any additional annotations of the output parameters in abc....p  pIn C, you can declare a parameter as a reference by prepending it with amp.  So in C terms this might be defined roughly asp  precodeprocedure abc arg1  TValue amparg2  TValue  codepre  pLater, you can refer to amparg2 and its using a POINTER to the object.  But in calling the function, you just sayp  precodeabc somevar1, somevar2  codepre  psomevar1 is passed by value, and somevar2 is passed by reference. Inside the function, I can save somevar2 in a reference var, then later on assign a value to it via the pointer if its a string by saying amparg2ref  abc.p  pIm guessing theres a way to do this in Delphi, either with a Variant as the oVar type, or using RTTI, or something else.  I just havent figured out the magic combination of pieces yet.  I just dont use pointers very often in Delphi.p  pMaybe I need to save a raw pointer in oVar along with the type say, oType, and cast a value through the pointer to save the propertys valuep  pIm hoping someone here might have some clear ideas.p  pBTW, Im using Delphi XE3.p

I want this to only show in the homepage therefore this is how I am doing itp  pStatement 2 p  precodeltphp ifishomegt ltdiv idportraitimagegt ltdiv classcontainergt ltcanvas idpanel width370 height175gtltcanvasgt ltdivgt ltdivgt ltphp endifgt codepre  pThis also works fine EXCEPT that when I added the first codeifishomecode statement above, it seems to disable the second codeifishomecode statement for some reason. I scratched my head for hours on the issue, also noting that if I place the second statement above the first one it suddenly works. p  pBut then I discovered something even weirder. If I remove codecat6,9ampampcode from statement 1, then 2 works. I see no logic as to how calling different posts categories would have in obstructing a conditional statement which simply calls a canvas if you are in the homepage inside the sidebar.php template.p  pHas anyone come across this weird issue, is my syntax wrong or could point me in the direction to resolving itp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 10393 pI have been doing a project with jQuery recently and I have hit an issue. The basic idea is to create some JS code so that as you enter content into a text box on a tab, the text inside a div changes as you type, and when you move to a new tab it changes to the text inside the text box there. It is quite hard to explain so there is a fiddle at a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netBenedictLewisbNnpT relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netBenedictLewisbNnpTap  pstrongEDITstrong Apologies, I was quite unclear in my question. I have the modal working fine, my problem is as follows When a user creates a tab they are presented with three text boxes. As they enter text into the text boxes on one tab the text inside  updates live with what they entered into Title, Subtitle and Content, similar to how text entered into the Page Title text box renames the tab live. When the user changes tab, the text should update to what is in the text boxes in the currently active tab.p  pWhat I have Triedp  precode.modalbody pageTitle.htmllth1gt  pageTitle  lth1gt .modalbody pageSubtitle.htmllth2gt  pageSubtitle  lth2gt .modalbody pageContent.htmlltpgt  pageContent  ltpgt codepre

No problems here, but problem arises because I must first check if the location is writable. Im testing this with [ w target ] command but it doesnt work because w is always false if folder doesnt exist. And in my case, it doesnt.p  pSolution Yes I could check the parent folder if its writable but you cannot know if  youre going to get for instance Desktopfolder1  or something like this Desktopfolder1folder2folder3folder4folder5 so i cant check the parent folder for rights as easily as I want.

Negative 10393 pI have a program written in VB.NET that as part of its function requires the use of a number of database classes. p  pAt the moment the classes are programmed specifically to use objects originating from  strongSystem.Data.SqlClientstrong and classes such as SqlConnection, SqlCommand, SqlParameter and SqlDataAdapter are used. p  pMy aim is to use the analogous classes from strongMysql.Data.MySqlClientstrong obtained via the ConnectorNet download on the MySQL site. These for example would be MySqlConnection, MySqlCommand, MySqlParameter and MySqlDataAdapter.p  pIs there some way in the code that I could maybe specify an abstract version of the classes something like AbstractSqlCommand, AbstractSqlParameter and be able to pick the correct implementation between SqlCommand and MySqlCommand based on the use of some other config variable. p  precode        Dim command As New AbsSqlCommandsql, connection         For Each p As AbsSqlParameter In param             command.Parameters.Addp         Next         Dim timeout As Integer  3000         command.CommandTimeout  timeout         Try             connection.Open         Catch             Throw New ExceptionConnection failed         End Try         Dim Adapter As New AbsSqlDataAdaptercommand         Adapter.Filltable         Return table codepre  pSo in the case above some kind of global or configuration variable could be ussed to differentiate between whether AbsSqlCommand is actually used as a MySqlCommand or a SqlCommand [MSSQL] without the need for having to recode every instantiation of these objects to suit the particular database platform.p

In this a hrefhttpsealedabstract.comcodensincrementalstorethefutureofwebservicesiniosmacosx relnofollow titletitlestrongpoststronga we can read thatp  blockquote   pEssentially you can now create a custom subclass of codeNSPersistentStorecode,   so that instead of your codeNSFetchRequestcode hitting a local SQLite   database, it runs a method you define that can do something arbitrary   to return results like make a network request.p blockquote  pUp to this point I thought that NSIncrementalStore was stronga perfect solution for accessing remote data and savingcaching it locallystrong. Now, I deduce that its a solution only for accessing remote data.p  pIf I am right I will be thankful for any piece of advice on some workaround. If I am wrong, where is the magic and how to implement it  Every postarticletutorial on NSIncrementalStore shows how easily it is to pull data from server but none of them has given even a single clue about caching things for offline viewing.p  pAnswering, lets consider a common scenario that an app is supposed to download some data from the Internet, display it and save locally so that users may use the app offline.p  pAlso, I am not committed to use NSIncrementalStore or something.

Negative 10393 pIm creating an application that downloads an attachment from an email thats automatically generated at midnight every night. The attachment is downloaded into a directory and from there is then parsed into a database.p  pThe main problem with this is that the email generation takes time, so the actually delivery time is unknown. Instead of having a program running the entire time, waiting on it to arrive, it would be far more elegant to have it automatically run the service to download the attachment when the email drops in the inbox, much in the same way as a FileSystemWatcher works on local directories. p  pThe email server runs Exchange 2003p  pIs there a way, programmatically or otherwise, to cause a service to run on receiving a new email p

Negative 10393 pBefore answer me, I am learning C currently and only have some knowledge about C.p  pHeres an example, the user will see a selection of language and the user must type the numbers at the left of languages to choose it, otherwise it will go back to the selection again.p  pSo I have an idea Put the strongmainstrong function at first and the stronglanguagestrong function at last. But the problem is because the strongmainstrong function is before the stronglanguagestrong function, so the strongmainstrong function cannot find the stronglanguagestrong function and end the program Of course because of this problem, I cant compile the source code.p  pHeres the example codep  precodeint main      language                      The main function redirect user to the language function   int language                      The language function      stdcout ltlt 1 for cookie             stdcin gtgt choice              Ask user for choice     if choice  1          choice1                   If the choice is 1, user will be redirected to choice1 function      else          main                       Otherwise user will be redirected to main and of course, redirect to language function again       codepre  pBecause of the problem described above, I got a warning from the CodeBlocks IDE when rebuilt the project p  blockquote   perror language was not declared in this scopep blockquote  pIs there is other ways to redirect a user to another function from a functionp  pstrongEDITstrong The current answers led me to infinite loop and this is not the result that I want to see. The result that I wish to see is if a user typed an invalid value, it will redirect the user to the function that the user is currently at again, and strongthe code must be only run ONCEstrong.

Negative 10393 pIm trying to find a way to take a wordpress page and display which other pages on the wordpress site like to it. p  pThe reason I need to do this Im putting together a site for employees to use to reference guidelines and procedures for our businesses operations.p  pIn the course of doing that, I might have a set of guidelines on page x. Then, on page y, I refer to the guidelines that were on page x and link to page x.p  pIf down the road we change the guidelines on page x, I want to be able to see all of the pages that cite and link to the guidelines on page x so I can go and update them accordingly.p  pSo if I change the guidelines on page x, I want to be able to see that page y cites and links to page x, so I should probably go to page y and update any references to the guidelines on page x. This would be much easier than going p  ol liDoes that make sense andli liAnyone have any idea how to do this or something similar My guess is the only way to do it is maybe pingbackrelated.li ol  pBack when I used to use Expressions Web, you could click on a page, you could click the Hyperlinks tab and see a list of all other pages linking to that specific page.

The last field is a memo field.  The result set is so large in SSMS 2012 that I cannot select them all with headers.  So I have to save to Excel csv format.

Negative 10393 pI have been working on an app which displays all the notifications in the phones status bar like a new msg or a missed call. By researching I found out that the only way to do that in android is to create an accessibility service. So I did the same by getting  AccessibilityEvent.TYPENOTIFICATIONSTATECHANGED in my accessibility service.br Here is my onServiceConnected method  p  precodepublic void onServiceConnected     if isInit          return          AccessibilityServiceInfo info  new AccessibilityServiceInfo     info.eventTypes  AccessibilityEvent.TYPENOTIFICATIONSTATECHANGED     info.feedbackType  AccessibilityServiceInfo.FEEDBACKSPOKEN     setServiceInfoinfo     isInit  true  codepre  pThis is working but not exactly I wish. Its actually showing many notifications which are not there in status bar and are being probably generated by background apps which i don want. Also its not real time. It updates only when I reopen the app and not while the app is open. Furthermore, as soon as I start the service in settings, my phonegalaxy note starts talking everything. Not sure if its a bug or some problem in the code.br I cant figure out where exactly the problem is but I think it can be the feedback type. I tried a lot but couldnt find out the meaning of different feedback types for the service anywhere.  p  precodeFEEDBACKAUDIBLE FEEDBACKHAPTIC FEEDBACKAUDIBLE FEEDBACKVISUAL FEEDBACKGENERIC codepre  pCan someone please tell me what does these feedback types imply And would I get different notifications if I change the feedback type And if you believe Im heading in the wrong direction then please guide me to what I can do to solve these problems. Lemme know if I forgot to provide some essential info.  p  pAny kind of help would be really appreciated.p

Negative 10393 pIt looks like if a background thread is running when you hit the home button, things are suspended and then resumed when reopening the app. I simply want things to stop when the home button is pressed so that on resume, the user can start things from the beginning. After doing some research, it looks like a simple bool flag to periodically check is the way to go. My question, is the part after that. I have the flag part working using some of the notifications like UIApplicationWillResignActiveNotification, but my question is what action to take to actually stop things. I can do a simple return to stop things, but how does that affect the thread itself As a general question, if nothing is running, or it gets to the end of the code, will the thread close itself Or is some sort of explicit exit call needed In my rough testing, that thread seems to go away, but I wasnt sure. p
Negative 10393 pEDIT I was able to figure something out, this fiddle reflects the change a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netKw27r5 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netKw27r5ap  pI have a div codegallerycode which contains a set of draggable tiles. They are to be dropped into another div codeimageDropContainercode which contains several drop zones. Here is the issue I am havingp  pWhen codegallerycodes codeoverflowycode property is set to visible, everything works fine. However, codegallerycode must have a fixed height, meaning it can only display 2 rows of tiles at once. So if the overflow is set to visible, you cant see anything in the 3rd row because it is hiding behind the codeimageDropContainercode which is immediately below codegallerycode. If you set the div to scrollable, then you can scroll to the other elements in the div but the tiles are hidden behind the drop zone while you are dragging them.p  pstrongHow can I allow the div to remain scrollable, but have draggable tiles not hide behind the drop zone while they are being draggedstrong in other words, strongHow can I circumvent the standard behavior of the emOverflowem propertystrongp  pHere is a fiddle to demonstratep  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netKw27r4 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netKw27r4ap  pWhat I have considered pertinant JS and CSS is shown in the fiddle.

Depending on what Field Names I send in my request to bloomberg, the returned Dictionary could have different key values.

Negative 10393 pI want some views bounce back at the edge of the screen. Therefore i already implemented a viewcontroller and some subviews for the bouncing. Its already known, when the view reaches the edge, all the Framecomparsion methods and exit angle methods are already known. But what is the best way for updating the views position. In the future, the rectangles should also bounce, when they reach eachother.p  pI tried to use [UIView animation..] methods and it pretty much worked but the viewlayer position calculation was pretty hard to handle because its a timing calculation, when a view reaches the edge of the screen.p  pThan I tried to update the screen with a scheduled timer just like this [NSTimer scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval130 targetself selectorselectorrender userInfonil repeatsYES] 30 fps if possible b But i just dont know if its a good approach for this, because I think, the battery gets drained too much, rightp  pDidnt get to learn OpenGL so far, but i might be pretty close, am i rightp  pWhat do you think, is the best way to solve this problem If OpenGl is the best approach, is there a good tutorial you could suggest i know, there are many, goolge is my friend, but id like to know from you.p

Negative 10393 pThis is just curiosity, I read on some posts that is not a recommended practice create constructors on Servlets, but to be honest I have no idea why they say that, there must be a reason because I know theres an codeinitcode method to initialize things, but why cant I use the constructor to do thisp  pAlso the Eclipse Servlet wizard generated a constructor calling codesupercode in it, and Im not why is this super doing there p  pThanksp

Negative 10393 pstrongModelstrong Users have expenses.  Expense has a status.p  pstrongViewstrong As users add their expenses, they are shown in a list.  Each expense row has a form button on the end, which is used to submit the expense changing the status of the expense.  This allows users to add expenses they have not completely filled out, and submit them when they are ready.  There is no parent form on this page, just the form buttons which submit the expense to a method which changes the status, and then reloads the page.p  pCurrently it works great, but users have asked to be able to submit all the expenses that are showing on the view with a single button.p  pstrongQuestionstrong What is the proper way to handle this in rails  Should I find a way to gather the array of expense ids and then submit a separate form  Is there a way to ask for a set of records present in a view with a certain statusp  pThanksp

Negative 10393 pIs it possible to use the python reload command or similar on a single module in a standalone cherrypy web app  I have a CherryPy based web application that often is under continual usage. From time to time Ill make an important change that only affects one module. I would like to be able to reload just that module immediately, without affecting the rest of the web application. A full restart is, admittedly, fast, however there are still several seconds of downtime that I would prefer to avoid if possible.p

Negative 10393 pI know its easy to make a memory pool for single objects, however I need to make a memory pool for arrays. The memory pool I have currently has a vector of addresses to contiguous memory blocks and a stack that points to each object from these blocks, so when you allocate from the pool you just pop the stack and when you free, you just push an objects address back to it. However I also need an array equivalent. Something like thisp  precodetemplatelttypename Tgt class ArrayPool  public ArrayPool ArrayPool  T AllocateArrayint x Returns a pointer to a T array that contains x elements. void FreeArrayT arr, int x Returns the array to the free address liststackwhatever  codepre  pHas such a thing been implemented I imagine a big problem from having such a pool  if make sure arrays returned by ALlocateArray are contiguous in memory, Im basically doing the same as if not having a memorypool. Just allocating arrays on the spot. With the normal object pool every time I just allocate 1 object. With the arrays I may allocate a different sized array every time, so once an array is freed, it wont be compatible with a new one of different size, unless I stich arrays together with some linkedlistlike structure, but then they wont be contiguous.p

I want to be able to run N number of workers across X number of machines and each one of these works will have Y numbers of tasks registered such as a.handleeventtypeA, b.handleeventtypeA, etc... and I want to be able to insert a task into a queue and have one worker pick up the task and route it to more than one task in the worker i.e. to both a.handleeventtypeA and b.handleeventtypeA.p  pI have read over the documentation of Kombu a hrefhttpkombu.readthedocs.orgenlatest relnofollowherea and Celerys routing documentation a hrefhttpcelery.readthedocs.orgenlatestuserguiderouting.html relnofollowherea and I cant seem to figure out how to configure this correctly.p  pI have been using Celery for some time now for more traditional workflows and I am very happy with its feature set, performance, and stability. I would implement what I need using Kombu directly or some homebrew solution, but I would like to use Celery if at all possible.p  pThanks guys I hope I dont waste anyones time with this question.p  h3Edit 1h3  pAfter some more time thinking about this issue I have come up with a workaround to implement what I want with Celery. Its not the emmostem elegant solution, but its working well. I am using django and its caching abstraction you can use something like memcached or redis directly instead. Heres the snippet I came up withp  precodefrom django.core.cache import cache from celery.execute import sendtask  SUBSCRIBERSKEY  tasksubscribers.0  def subscribetaskkey, task      get current list of subscribers     cachekey  SUBSCRIBERSKEY.formatkey     subscribers  cache.getcachekey or []      get task name     if hasattrtask, delay         name  task.name     else         name  task      add to list     if not name in subscribers         subscribers.appendname      set cache     cache.setcachekey, subscribers  def publishtaskkey, kargs      get current list of subscribers     cachekey  SUBSCRIBERSKEY.formatkey     subscribers  cache.getcachekey or []      iterate through all subscribers and execute task     for task in subscribers          send celery task         sendtasktask, argskargs, kwargs codepre  pWhat I then do is subscribe to tasks in different modules by doing the followingp  precodesubscribetasktypeA, some.lib.b.tasks.handleeventtypeA codepre  pThen I can call the publish task method when handling the REST events.p

Negative 10393 pSo I was trying to set a column as the primary key and was getting some errors as I tried to set it as NOT NULL in the import wizard.

Negative 10393 pWell, this might be a bit hard to explain but here is the deal I have a custom view which has a background image and some other smaller images drawn above it. The whole view, when the user selects the option to save it, will be scaled to a certain resolution, lets say 900x900px. So if the phone is 720p the image will be scaled up, while if the screen is 1080p will be scaled down.p  pHow is scaling donep  ul liI take the views layout params and change the width to 900px.li liThe background stored image is exactly at 900px, so when the view is prepared to be saved, I simply reload the background image at full quality.li liAll the other small images, get scaled as well, both their size and their position on screen.li ul  pSo, if initially if the screen size is 720px width, when the size is changed to 900px, I calculate a scale factor, within codeonMeasurecodep  precodeOverride protected void onMeasureint widthMeasureSpec, int heightMeasureSpec           super.onMeasurewidthMeasureSpec, widthMeasureSpec          if MeasureSpec.getSizewidthMeasureSpec  900                  scale  900  viewWidth  100.2f  viewWidth                 prepareSaving           codepre  pThen I use this scale number when drawingp  precodecanvas.drawBitmapmyCachedImage, x  addScalex, y  addScaley, imagePaint codepre  pwherep  precodeprivate float addScalefloat value          if scale  0              return 0          else              return value  scale  100.2f               codepre  pThis allows me to draw the bitmap at scaled coordinates, and this works as expected. The problem appears when the user rotates the image. On rotate I dop  precodepublic void rotateStickerfloat degrees       imageMatrix.setRotatedegrees, imageCenterX  addScaleimageCenterX, imageCenterY imageCenterY   codepre  pWithin onDraw I dop  precodeif angle0    canvas.saveCanvas.MATRIXSAVEFLAG    canvas.setMatriximageMatrix    canvas.drawBitmapmyCachedImage, x  addScalex, y  addScaley, imagePaint    canvas.retore else     canvas.drawBitmapmyCachedImage, x  addScalex, y  addScaley, imagePaint  codepre  pHere is my problem if the user does not rotate, all scaling is done correctly and the saved image looks good. If there is an angle, on scaling, the image is not drawn in the right coordinates, it is moved, just like in the image bellow a hrefhttpi.imgur.combFBHVF1.png relnofollowhttpi.imgur.combFBHVF1.pngap

What is happening Does the JVM optimize code for predefined variables Can I reasonably solve this problem without defining my arrays contents in code which Im sure will solve this issue p  pIf I can solve this, the optimization will produce a new sorting algorithm that will run much faster than Java 7s implementation of the emQuickSort algorithmem.

I have tracked the slowdown to 2 incidences of this line of code in 2 for loops and I need help.p

Negative 10393 pMy company wants to minimize number of connection to a database. For this reason, they want to develop a smart server which will handle smart clients. Now I have to come up with such an application which can connect to a database and then it will read data from database and give it back to the client Hence the applications will connect to a web service, not directly to the database.p  pI want to make the existing huge applications currently using ADO.net classes to use this smart client application.

Negative 10393 pI have no background in programming whatsoever, so I would appreciate it if you would explain how and why any code you recommend should be written the way it is.p  pI have a data matrix 2,000 samples, and need to do the following manipulate the format in one column.p  pI would also like to manipulate the format of one of the columns so that it is easier to merge with my other matrix. For example, one column is known as sample number column 16. The format is currently similar to codeABCDA1A0SD01A11DA10Y09code, yet I would like to change it to be formatted to the following codeABCDA1A0SD01Acode. This will allow me to have it in the right format so that I can merge it with another matrix. I seem to not be able to find any information on how to proceed with this step.p  pThe sample input should look like this p  precodeABCDA1A0SD01A11DA10Y09 ABCDA1A0SD01A11DA10Y09 ABCDA1A0SE01A11DA10Y09 ABCDA1A0SE01A11DA10Y09 ABCDA1A0SF01A11DA10Y09 ABCDA1A0SH01A11DA10Y09 ABCDA1A0SI01A11DA10Y09 codepre  pI want the last three extensions removed.

This is a issue when I tackle the next step which is merging the two matrices together. The original matrix has about 52 columns and 2,000 rows, whereas the merging matrix only has 15 column and 467 rows.p  pEach row of the original matrix has mutational information for a patient. This means that the same patient with the same ID might appear many times. The second matrix contains the patient information, so no patients are repeated in that matrix. When merging the matrix, I want to make sure that every patient mutation each row is matched with its corresponding information from the merging matrix.p  pMy sample codep  precodeusrbinperl   use strict use warnings  my file  sortedsamples2.txt  openINFILE, file or die Cant open file n openmy outfile, gt, sortedsampleschanged.txt  foreach my line ltINFILEgt      print The input line is linen     my columns  splitt, line      columns[15]  columns[15]wwwwwdwwwddw      printf  outfile columnsn  codepre  pIssues The code deletes the header and deleted the string in column 16.p

As far as radeontop is concerned at this point there is nothing going on on the GPU, 0 for all statistics.p  pThe problem seems to be that the call to oclgqueue.enqueueWriteImageimgepi, CLTRUE, origin, region, 0, 0, epi.data, 0, NULL never finishes. If I change the call to nonblocking, the program continues running, untill the next blocking call which wont return either. p  pI tried flushing didnt help much either.

Negative 10393 pI was not sure how to title this question, and I am having difficulty trying to describe the problem well. I have been struggling on how to setup my database for a site I am working on.p  pMy problem is that I cant figure out how to properly setup items table. I have a company table which links to an items table which links to an itemSizePrice table. Since the system has multiple companies, which can all have multiple items, I cant figure out how to get at a specific itemID.p  pDatabase layout can be seen in this image img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com1BLnk.jpg altDatabasep  pSince each company can have multiple items, a select statement using companyID, for instance, would return many many lines. I thought about using something else that would be unique, such as the imagePath, since it is date and time stamped in the filename, but I need to get the ItemID in order to get the proper imagePath, to then get the itemID. Basically its a circle. p  pIs there a better way to setup this database Can anyone help me out and give me an idea as to have to get at a single itemIDp  pEdit I omitted the pieces of the database that are not relevant.p
Negative 10393 pIve started using the Apache web server that comes with OS X 10.9.4 for testing. When I copy files to its web root LibraryWebServerDocuments or delete from the same, I get prompted for the admin password. I have this password, so thats not a problem. Its just inefficient. I havent had this issue when using other installs of Apache generally via MAMP. So Im sure its just a config issue. Any help is appreciated.  p

Negative 10393 pI am using an ARM cortex A9 platfrom to measure the performance of some algorithms.

Object file n returns 0,12sec while Object file nn returns 0.1sec. I compared the two binaries files and they dont differences. I noticed that if I give a name to the object file larger than 1 letter then I always have less execution time for my algorithm.

Negative 10393 pI have the following problem and I am struggling to find if a solution exists for it, or what the best practice is here.p  pI have a site example.com, and multiple servers with different IP addresses around the world.  I am seeing the following behaviour in my browser Chrome  for simplicity lets say I only have 2 IP addresses for now.p  pI connect to example.com and data is served from IP address A.B.C.D server 1.  After 40 seconds or, any subsequent request GETPOST to example.com then resolves to W.X.Y.Z server 2.  My issue is that I have a cookie based web session on server 1, and server 2 knows nothing about that session.  There is no kind of backend replication I can do to sync state between both servers.p  pIs there any way I can force the browser to only connect to a single server once a server has served the first page  I am using RR DNS with multiple A records at the moment. Would switching to CNAME solve this problemp  pOne solution I was thinking of was having each server reply with a configured domain in the http headers e.g. server1 would reply with XHEADER server1.example.com, server2 would reply with XHEADER server2.example.com and then force the browser to make requests to these.  I would then have a single IP address for server1.example.com, and another for server2.example.com.  Does this break sameorigin policy though If I am on example.com can I send GETPOSTPUT etc. to server1.example.comp  pId really appreciate any advice on this  Im so confusedp

This works fine if I do not have a edge body around the screen, but behaves very strangely when I add the edge loop comment out the edge loop and it works again.p  precodeself.physicsBody [SKPhysicsBody bodyWithEdgeLoopFromRectself.frame]  codepre  pNOTE I have added an update at the end which explains the behaviour but not the cause.p  hr  pNSLog shows the edge loop being created with the expected frame 0, 0, 768, 1024, and the sprite being added with the correct position and velocity. p  pBy the time codedidSimulatePhysicscode is called the first time through the rendering loop, the sprites position has moved to a point a quarter of the way up the screen in landscape and the dx component of the velocity has become zero. The sprite then travels vertically, bouncing up and down over a distance of 512 points centered within the screen.p  pIn other words, the sprite seems to move up and down along a vertical line between 384, 384 and 384, 896, as though the edge loop is positioned at 384, 384, 0, 512 instead of 0, 0, 768, 1024.p  pIf I change the starting position of the sprite to be on this line, it starts at the correct position, but still loses its x velocity component and remains constrained to this line. If I start the sprite within the y range of this line but with an x coordinate off the line, it immediately moves to the nearest point on the line and the same behaviour continues.p  pAs suggested in other questions I have tried presenting the codeSKScenecode from the view controllers codeviewWillAppearcode and codeviewWillLayoutSubviewscode but the behaviour is the same.p  pI have tried hard coding the edge loop frame  no change. The behaviour is also the same on the simulator and a device.p  pI have another toy app with seemingly identical code for presenting the codeSKScenecode, setting up the edge loop and spawning sprites which works fine.p  pThe following code is from the SKScene subclassp  precode idinitWithSizeCGSizesize      if self [super initWithSizesize] return nil      self.physicsWorld.contactDelegate self     self.physicsWorld.gravity CGVectorMake0.0, 0.0      self.spriteAtlas [SKTextureAtlas atlasNamedsprites]      srandomunsigned inttimeNULL      return self      voiddidMoveToViewSKView view      if self.contentCreated              [self createTestSceneContent]         self.contentCreated YES           voidcreateTestSceneContent      self.backgroundColor [SKColor whiteColor]     self.scaleMode SKSceneScaleModeAspectFit     self.name scene      CGRect fr self.frame      NSLogbodyWithEdgeLoopFromRect , NSStringFromCGRectfr       commenting out the following line resolves the issue     self.physicsBody [SKPhysicsBody bodyWithEdgeLoopFromRectfr]      self.physicsBody.friction 0.0     self.physicsBody.restitution 1.0     self.physicsBody.linearDamping 0.0     self.physicsBody.angularDamping 0.0      SKSpriteNode ball [[SKSpriteNode alloc] initWithTexture[self.spriteAtlas textureNamedball]]      ball.name ball     ball.physicsBody [SKPhysicsBody bodyWithCircleOfRadiusself.size.width  2.0]     ball.physicsBody.dynamic YES     ball.physicsBody.mass 1.0     ball.physicsBody.restitution 1.0     ball.physicsBody.friction 0.0     ball.physicsBody.linearDamping 0.0     ball.physicsBody.angularDamping 0.0     ball.physicsBody.affectedByGravity NO     ball.physicsBody.contactTestBitMask 1      ball.position CGPointMakeself.size.width  2.0, ball.size.height  2.0     ball.physicsBody.velocity CGVectorMake75.0, 75.0      [self addChildball]      NSLogcreateTestSceneContent  p , v , NSStringFromCGPointball.position, NSStringFromCGVectorball.physicsBody.velocity      voiddidSimulatePhysics      SKNode ball [self childNodeWithNameball]      NSLogdidSimulatePhysics      p , v , NSStringFromCGPointball.position, NSStringFromCGVectorball.physicsBody.velocity  codepre  pand produces the following log outputp  blockquote   pbodyWithEdgeLoopFromRect 0, 0, 768, 1024p      pcreateTestSceneContent  p 384, 15, v 75, 75p      pdidSimulatePhysics      p 383.90228, 389.04977, v 0, 75 p      pdidSimulatePhysics      p 383.91571, 390.29974, v 0, 75 p      pdidSimulatePhysics      p 383.92258, 392.17471, v 0, 75 p      p... p      pdidSimulatePhysics      p 383.92499, 637.17346, v 0, 75 p      pdidSimulatePhysics      p 383.92499, 638.42346, v 0, 75 p      pdidSimulatePhysics      p 383.92499, 638.42346, v 0, 75p      pdidSimulatePhysics      p 383.92499, 637.17346, v 0, 75p blockquote  hr  pUPDATEp  pAfter a lot of experimenting with adding different edge bodies I can explain what is happening, but not why.p  pAny edge body I add seems to take effect 384 points from the position where the body is. 384 is half the width of the landscape iPad screen.p  pFor example if I add an edge along the left hand side of the screenp  precodeself.physicsBody [SKPhysicsBody bodyWithEdgeFromPointCGPointMake0.0, 0.0 toPointCGPointMake0.0, self.size.height] codepre  pthe sprite will bounce of it at x  384.p  pSo with an edge loop sized for the frame, the ball gets confined into an area inset 384 points from the edges of the screen, which is a line 256 points long in the centre of the screen. Setting the edge loop with a rectangle 384 points outside each edge of the screen results in the correct behaviour i.e. the sprite bounces at the screen edgesp  precodeself.physicsBody [SKPhysicsBody bodyWithEdgeLoopFromRectCGRectInsetself.frame, 384.0, 384.0] codepre  pWhile this kludge fixes the immediate problem, I still want to understand why this is happening as I assume it is a symptom of an underlying problem that will show up in other places in the app as well.p  pAny thoughts would be much appreciated.

Negative 10393 pIs it possible to disable run time and compile time checks on a class using a method call or similar I am having trouble with my classes with invariants and using them with external libraries that construct instances dynamically. I would like to wrap those calls inside my own calls, which take a potentially partially constructed object, and returns one that is always valid.p  pEg consider this codep  precodeusing System using System.Collections.Generic using System.Diagnostics.Contracts  namespace ConsoleApp      class Person              public string Name  get set          public string Email  get set          public string JobTitle  get set           public Personstring name, string email, string title                      Name  name             Email  email             JobTitle  title                   [ContractInvariantMethod]         private void ObjectInvariant                      Contract.InvariantName  null             Contract.InvariantJobTitle  null                     public static class ObjectBuilder               Just a sample method for building an object dynamically. In my actual code, code using           elastic search, NEST, serializion or entity framework has similar problems.         public static T BuildFromDictionaryltTgtDictionaryltstring, objectgt dict                      Contract.Requiresdict  null             T result  TSystem.Runtime.Serialization.FormatterServices.GetUninitializedObjecttypeof T             foreach var pair in dict                              string propName  pair.Key                 var property  typeof T.GetPropertypropName                 property.SetValueresult, pair.Value                          return result                   class Program              public static Person CreatePerson                      Dictionaryltstring, objectgt personData  new Dictionaryltstring, objectgt             personData[Name]  Fred             personData[Email]  emailexample.com             Person person  ObjectBuilder.BuildFromDictionaryltPersongtpersonData             person.JobTitle  Programmer             return person                  static void Mainstring[] args                      Person person1  new PersonBob, Bobexample.com, Hacker              Person person  CreatePerson             Console.WriteLineperson.Name                  codepre  pThis compiles correctly, however will throw an exception on the codeproperty.SetValueresult, pair.Valuecode line. This is because it will call the Name setter, and at that stage codeEmailcode and codeJobTitlecode are null.p  pWhat I would like to do is to disable contracts within a code section. Eg, replacing the codeCreatePersoncode method with something like thisp  precode    public static Person CreatePerson              Dictionaryltstring, objectgt personData  new Dictionaryltstring, objectgt         personData[Name]  Fred         personData[Email]  emailexample.com         Person person         Contract.DisableRunTimeChecks gt                      person  ObjectBuilder.BuildFromDictionaryltPersongtpersonData             person.JobTitle  Programmer                   Contract.CheckInvariantsperson         return person      codepre  pWhere codeContract.DisableRunTimeCheckscode disables run time checks for all code within that code block and any calls made within, and codeContract.CheckInvariantscode runs the codeContractInvariantMethodcode for the given object.p  pIs this possible to implement somehow, or is there another solutionp  pOne solution I have seen which I dont want to do is to introduce an codeinitializedcode field on codePersoncode, and making the invariant method check if that is true before doing any checks. This is because the object should always be valid except for one or two of these constructor methods.p

Negative 10393 pIm currently interested in using Cross Entropy Error when performing the BackPropagation algorithm for classification, where I use the Softmax Activation Function in my output layer.p  pFrom what I gather, you can drop the derivative to look like this with Cross Entropy and Softmax p  precodeError  targetOutput[i]  layerOutput[i] codepre  pThis differs from the Mean Squared Error ofp  precodeError  DerivativelayerOutput[i]  targetOutput[i]  layerOutput[i] codepre  pSo, can you only drop the derivative term when your output layer is using the Softmax Activation Function for classification with Cross Entropy For instance, if I were to do Regression using the Cross Entropy Error with say TANH activation function I would still need to keep the derivative term, correctp  pI havent been able to find an explicit answer on this and I havent attempted to work out the math on this either as I am rusty.p

Can you give me a stepbystep answer of what to do to implement the answer from the question in the link I gave p  pFrom extracting the feature points to training the KD tree and using it for every frame from the camera.p  pBonus questions  Can you give a definition of feature point Its something I couldnt exactly understand.

Negative 10393 pI have a situation where Id like to use a UISearchController to allow searchingfiltering the contents of a UITableView. The behavior I want is IDENTICAL to what Apple does in the Contacts app where the search bar stays pinned to the top of the table view, content scrolling underneath. When the search bar is tapped, I want the default behavior of the bar animating to cover the navigation bar with results below, again just like Apple contacts. p  pIve made a sample app to isolate things and have paired it down to the following search controller init code. This VC is the root view controller of a UINavigationController with a translucent nav bar. p  precodeself.navigationItem.title  Title self.edgesForExtendedLayout  UIRectEdgeNone  self.searchController  [[UISearchController alloc] initWithSearchResultsControllernil] self.searchController.searchBar.frame  CGRectMake0.0f, 0.0f, 320.0f, 44.0f self.searchController.hidesNavigationBarDuringPresentation  YES self.searchController.dimsBackgroundDuringPresentation  NO [self.view addSubviewself.searchController.searchBar] self.definesPresentationContext  YES codepre  pThis results in two issues 1 The search bar does not expand height to 64px so you still see whats behind the status bar and 2 whenever you push an item onto the navigation stack and then go back, the content in the parent view table view jumps.p  pIve seen a ton of confusion around UISearchcontroller, so Im not terribly optimistic that someone has a good solution, but trying anyway. p
Negative 10393 pThis past week Ive inundated myself with links and led myself in too many circles to count, so I thought Id pose the question here.  I have an Android app that displays webviews pointing to urls which the user must be signed in with their Google account to see the backend is built in Google App Engine.  Since the end user is likely to be signed into their Google account on their Android anyway, Id like the signin process to be automatic.  Currently, on the first webview the user opens up they are presented with the Google signin form and a really ugly subsequent page asking would you like to allow example.appspot.com to use your Google account  p  pThat process is dreadful for user experience.  Ive seen precious few resources here and there concerning autologin, but Im frankly lost in the sea of almostwhatIwantbutnotquite to be able to discern the direction I ought to be going.  p  pI read through a hrefhttpblog.notdot.net201005AuthenticatingagainstAppEnginefromanAndroidapp relnofollowNicksa tutorial on authenticating an app with App Engine, but just having the token doesnt get me the uniquelyassigned user ID associated with every Google account on the backend.  On top of that, prior experience has taught me the hard way that an apps webview session is incongruous with the apps HTTPClient session.  So even if I could log in with Nicks method it wouldnt help me sign into the webviews.p  pThen I came across a hrefhttpeatdev.tumblr.compost40358289314googleautologininanandroidwebview relnofollowthis tutoriala, which actually seems really promising, but so far I havent been able to adapt his code to work with my own.p  pI also found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions25804725androidwebviewautologintohttpswebsitebysettingtokencookiethis SO linka which suggests that all I need to do is pass the auth token which I could presumably obtain via Nicks method into every webview I load as a cookie.  p  pAnd thats about it.  They are all rather different approaches, so Im wondering if any of them are actually what I want.  Or, if somewhere out there a reasonably simple approach actually exists.  Id really appreciate it if someone knows of a straightforward answer on this one.  Thank youp

Negative 10393 pAt my company we use SVN for version control, making a tag every time we release a software version, and our internal policy states that whatever we release must have gone through a code review process. Code reviews are differential and based on revisions, that is, somebody checks all the commits from a certain revision to another one. Then, our QA department must check that, for example, the new tag doesnt contain any file which was changed after the last revision that was reviewed.p  pIll make an example. We have 2 files, A.txt and B.txt. They were both committed at revision 50. Then, a tag is made, and the revision of the tag is 100. Then somebody changes A.txt at revision 120, and B.txt at 140 and then again at 150. A second tag is made, which gets revision 200. This means that the first tag 100 includes A50 and B50, but the second tag 200 includes A120 and B150. These data A changed from 50 to 120, B from 50 to 150 are what our QA department needs. Suppose that, due to some error, whoever made the code review started at revision 60 and stopped at 130, checking all what was changed in the middle. This would mean that there are gaps nobody reviewed the changes between 50 and 60, and nobody reviewed the changes after 130. Our QA must detect these gaps and block the release until all the code has been reviewed properly.p  pMy task is to start from the 2 tags previous version and current release candidate and extract the list of changes, including the Last Changed Revision of each file. In my example, the tag 100 includes A and B, but the Last Changed Revision of A and B isnt 100, its 50, and thats what I have to find out.p  pCurrently, I have found this approach First, get the list of changedaddeddeleted files, with this commandp  precodesvn diff summarize oldprevioustag100 newcurrenttag200 codepre  pThen, process the output for each changed file callp  precodesvn info file100 codepre  pandp  precodesvn info file200 codepre  pand for both parse the output and extract the Last Changed Rev, which is what I need for A it would be 50 and 120. For added files theres only the second revision it didnt exist yet when the first tag was made, and for deleted ones theres only the first one, but the concept is the same.p  pThen I have my final output, which is a .csv file like thisp  precodeA.txt, changed, 50, 120 B.txt, changed, 50, 150 codepre  pSo far so good. The point is, its really slow, as I need to call SVN twice for each changed file. Sometimes this translates to hundreds, or even thousands, of calls. The SVN server is on my LAN, and each call takes around one second, so generating the full list can take some hours. This is slow but still acceptable. But we also have a second team which is like 6000 km from here and which accesses the server via a VPN. Its terribly slow what takes 10 minutes from my pc can take 5 hours from theirs, and I have been asked to speed everything up. The point is, I have no idea how. The best way would be to get all these info with the first call to svn, the svn diff. My question is is it possible to do it Or is my current approach the only one I feel SVN, internally, can access the Last Changed Revision very quickly, and uses it to calculate the list of differences. But it isnt shown normally, and in order to get it I have to call SVN info twice. Is there a way to avoid that I checked the options of the svn diff command and I havent found anything.p

Negative 10393 pOkay this is a first question so I dont know if I can word it properly. I will give a hypothetical situation at the end.p  pSo basically what I am looking to do is When a client registers on whmcs and their order is accepted, specific details of their account are sent and inputted into other tables in the database. There is one main database containing all the relative fields for each service with a prefix of the service name.p  pI also want it so that if they cancel their account, or their account is suspended because they havent payed, basically that their main service goes off, it will also decline access to all the other services. When they change their details from the main WHMCS database, like their email and password, it will update on all other services.p  pSo now for the hypothetical situation.p  pJoe signs up and buys a package from COMPANY. Joes order is accepted and his web hosting service is online. COMPANY also wants to offer Joe additional services from his same account, without the need for him to resign up on the other services hosted by COMPANY. Joe now has access to all services under one account. Joe is behind on his payment and his services are cancelled, so he cannot access the other services. Joe forgot his password so he needs to change it, it updates on the other services simultaneously. Joe cancels his account, all details are deleted from all services.p  pSorry if it is badly worded, I cant really grasp an explanation for the problem.p  pHere is a snippet of code from a test hook.p  precode    ltphp  if definedWHMCS     dieThis file cannot be accessed directly  function createudriveaccountvars       firstname  vars[firstname]     lastname  vars[lastname]     email  vars[email]     password  vars[password]     username  email     title  Mr    set POST variables url  httpsCOMPANY.comWHCMSDIRSERVICEDIRregister.html fields  array                         lname gt urlencodelastname,                         fname gt urlencodefirstname,                         title gt urlencodetitle,                         company gt urlencodeinstitution,                         age gt urlencodeage,                         email gt urlencodeemail,                         phone gt urlencodephone                   urlify the data for the POST foreachfields as keygtvalue  fieldsstring . key..value.amp  rtrimfieldsstring, amp  open connection ch  curlinit  set the url, number of POST vars, POST data curlsetoptch,CURLOPTURL, url curlsetoptch,CURLOPTPOST, countfields curlsetoptch,CURLOPTPOSTFIELDS, fieldsstring  execute post result  curlexecch  close connection curlclosech          addhookClientAdd,1,createudriveaccount codepre

Negative 10393 pHey Guys ,               I am new to Node.js and have a doubt to clear ...p  pMy question is when node js is single threaded and non blocking tel me about this scenario.  Like When client1  sends a request to get the data from DB to the main thread of Node , Node assigns the task to the thread pool and say the T1 thread from the thread pool will be executing that task by accessing the data from DB.... Lets at the same time another client say client2  requests some data from DB to the main thread and node assigns that task also to the thread pool so say T2 also goes to the same DB  to get  the  data but still T1 has not finished accessing data from DB .. So  T2 is basically WAITING right   N guys also share some good videos and documents on Node.js and basic programming examples..p  pThanks p

Negative 10393 pSimple question here with a potentially tricky answer  I am looking for a strongportablestrong and stronglocalization friendlystrong way to remove trailing newlines in C, preferably something standardsbased.p  pI am already aware of the following solutionsp  ul lipParsing for some combination of codercode and codencode.  Really not pretty when dealing with Windows, nix and Mac, all which use different sequences to represent a new line.  Also, do other languages even use the same escape sequence for a new line  I expect this will blow up in languages that use different glyphs from English say, Japanese or the like.pli lipRemoving trailing codencode bytes and replacing final code0code.  Seems like a more brittle way of doing the above.pli lipcodeisspacecode looks tempting but I need to only match newlines.  Other whitespace is considered valid token text.pli lipC has a class to do this but it is of little help to me in a pureC world.pli lipcodelocale.hcode seems like what I am after but I cannot see anything pertinent to extracting newline tokens.pli ul  pSo, with that, is this an instance that I will have to roll my own functionality or is there something that I have missed  Thanksp  hr  pstrongSolutionstrongp  pI ended up combining both answers from codeWeather Vanecode and codeLoiccode, respectively, for my final solution.  What worked was to use the handy codestrcspncode function to break on the first newline character as selected from Loics provided links.  Thus, I can select delimiters based on a number of supported locales.  Is a good point that there are too many to support generically at this level I didnt even know that there were several competing encodings for the Cyrillic.p  pIn this way, I can achieve good enough multinational support while still using standard library functions.p  pSince I can only accept one answer, I am selecting Weather Vanes as his was the final invocation I used.  That being said, it was really the two answers together that worked for me.p

Negative 10393 pI have an Ember 1.10 application with api support for 2 models, Students and Parents, and basic CRUD setup for each model, as well as the ability to read and write messages tofrom Students and Parents when visiting their respective show pages. p  pI must create an Inbox in which the messages as well as all the other data on Students and Parents is available and must do so without the ability to change or add to the api i.e. I can create a Messages endpoint.p  pBasically, I need to keep the Student and Parent models and controllers as they are, but need to be able to access them from routes namespaced under the Inbox like sop  precodeStudents   inbox   index   edit   show Parents   inbox Inbox   StudentInbox  lt should use StudentsRoute and StudentsController     index     show     edit   ParentInbox     index     show     edit codepre  pSo that visiting inboxstudents123 will be using the model defined in the StudentRoute and the actions and properties defined on the StudentController. The InboxStudentsShowRoute should similarly have access to the StudentsShowRoute and Controller.p  pInstead of copying and pasting the existing code from the Student and Parent routes and controllers, is there a way to proxy actions fired from templates under the Inbox namespace to the relevant models and controllers and maintain the ability to pass in params. p  pFor example, passing in params like codeunreadtruecode while on the InboxStudentsShow route would pass these to the StudentsShowRoute and Controller and bubble appropriately to its parent route and controller or editing a Student from studentinbox123edit template would work just as it does on the student123edit templatep  pNew to Ember and know there has to be a better way to reuse existing code and proxy actions from a namespace. Any advice would be greatly appreciatedp

Each point and name was given an class namenumber using d3 so I can target each specific element.p  pI then added a mouseover and mouseout function, using jQuery, to the city points so I can display that points latitude lat and Longitude lon, information written in the json file.  Everything works great, when I mouseover the different points the correct information displays and when I mouseout it disappears.

Thanks in advance.  TonyTp

Negative 10393 pSo i am Using AVFoundation to capture video and audio from an external device and to write to a ProRes encoded .mov file. I started with an application that only writes video buffers to a file, and this works fine, producing a ProRes encoded .mov as expected.p  pHowever when i add the Audio AssetWriterInput to the AssetWriter, the file that gets created appears to be invalid. I have checked all the return values for each step of the operation, and everything appears to be ok, its not until i call finishWriting on the assetWriter at the very end of things that i get an error.   Sadly checking this error reveals the 11800 AVErrorUnkown error, which isnt much help.p  pNow, a few things to note  I am trying to create a file with multiple tracks of uncompressed audio. Eg 48Khz, 16bit,      however for the sake of simplicity currently my sample only uses 1 track, which means only 1 AVAssetWriterIput for the audio.      I am 95 sure i have specified the dictionary settings correctly, but if your confident with that topic plz have a quick look to confirm.p  ul lipAm a bit unsure of the correct CMTime value to use when i create my audio CMSampleBuffer, with video i am adding 1 frame at a time, with a fps of 25,  my CMTime values are created as such  CMTimeMakeframeNo, 25.00  but for the Audio buffers i am using CMTimeMakeframeNo  1920, 48000  because the CMSampleBuf contains 1920 smples, at an overall rate of 48khz.  Do the CMTime values need to match across the 2 different AVAssetInputWriter instances  ie. video and audio  1920 because there are 1920 unique audio samples for a single frame of Video  ie. PAL  1080i50pli lipThe resulting mov file that is created appears to be the correct size, ie. it is slightly bigger than the same file but with Video only.pli lipIf I comment out ONLY the Audio AVAssetWriterInput appendSampleBuffer  call, the resulting file is readable, and fine,  though it shows no audio tracks, despite me adding, starting and stopping the inputWriter, but obviously not writing any actual samples.pli ul  pOK so here is the Code, just ignore the stuff about decoding hanc buffers and geting the video thats all relevant to getting the data form the device in Question.p  precodeint mainint argc, const char  argv[]   autoreleasepool      NSLogHello, World   Welcome to the ProResCapture With Audio sample app.      OSStatus status     AudioStreamBasicDescription audioFormat     CMAudioFormatDescriptionRef audioFormatDesc       OK so lets include the BVC stuff first and then we can see about doing some actual capture  and compress stuff     BLUEVELVETCHANDLE pBVC  bfcFactory     if pBVC              BLUEUINT32 inputVidMode  VIDFMTINVALID         BLUEUINT32 memFmt  MEMFMTARGB         BLUEUINT32 height  0         BLUEUINT32 width  0         BLUEUINT32 fpsRate  0         BLUEUINT32 bIs1001  false         BLUEUINT32 bIsProgressive  false         unsigned long ulUpdateType  UPDFMTFRAME         unsigned long ulFieldCount  0         unsigned int numAudioChannels  1 4         int numFramesToCapture  200          bfcAttachpBVC, 1  just use the first card for this demo  sample         bfcSetCardProperty32pBVC, DEFAULTVIDEOINPUTCHANNEL, BLUEVIDEOINPUTCHANNELA  use input channel A           check for a Valid input video signal.         bfcQueryCardProperty32pBVC, VIDEOINPUTSIGNALVIDEOMODE, inputVidMode         if inputVidMode lt VIDFMTINVALID                       Configure the card for basic RGBA capture.

I can make video only work. I can do all the setup and configuration for the audio but not add the buffers and it works. When i DO add the audio samples the appendSampleBuffer call complets without error.p  pBut when i try and finishcomplete the file i get an error from the [assetWriter finishWriting] call Of course looking into the rror is no help p  pSo what am i doing wrong anyone got any suggestions on how i can examine or diagnose the broken mov file that is createdp  pI haved used Atom Inspector to examine 3 different files,p  pA. The working file ie. video only no audio, written via my application using AVFoundation.p  pB. The broken file ie video and audio, written via my applpication using AVFoundation.p  pC. A working file created with FinalCutPro legacy and exported using the same settings i am tryint to use for my application.p  pI should also mention that i have tried to use the old dumpster toolapp to open the file but since it is looking at the moov Atom directly it fails to open my broken file at all.p  pOK so my results... File C appears to be quite different so it has not provided much help, as a comparison tool. not surprising since it was created differently BUT, When i examine the broken video file  ie file B  it ONLY has the following Atoms ftyp  File Type wide  Wide Atom Header mdat  Media Headerp  pwhereas file A, has many many more, including the moov  Movie Atom which in turn contains all the useful information.p  pSO, something about the way i am closing the file or adding the audio is causing the moov Atom to not be written properly, or at all, to the file upon close.p  pAny comments would be most appreciated,p  pThanks,      Jamesp

Only XmlElement, XmlArray, XmlArrayItem, XmlAnyAttribute and   XmlAnyElement attributes are supported when IsWrapped is true.p blockquote  pIve seen posts that suggest using codesvcutil wrapped serializerXmlSerializercode might do the trick, but that seems to have issues with namespaces and not finding codeany valid contracts or services, or because all contractsservices were discovered to exist in reference assemblies.codep  pSince the Add Service Reference command from VS2015 uses svcutil, Id like to see what options that uses, and modify that to add the wrapped option.p  pAdditionally, if I generate a Web Reference, that works, but Im not happy with having to write a bunch of extra code to load the certificate used for the web service authentication. Id rather use the web.config  app.config to define the bindings and end points.p

Negative 10393 pThis is the part of C that things looks confusing to me.  Consider this basic of example of inheritance and polymorphism. Each class below has virtual functions  and called in the main function, but the output puzzles me a bit. p  pFirst, I understand that codeAamp r1  bcodeis a reference to the B object that was created before, and it should call the test function in B because both are virtual. From what Ive learned the mostderivedlatest function will be called.  Yes, it calls the lastest function but what I am concerned is the argument, in the output says code10code, but the default argument in test function in class B is code50code. Same goes for codeAamp r2  ccode , the test function in C has no default argument but gets the argument in test function from class B instead. p  pAlso the test function in C are private, Isnt that if private you can only call them inside the class p  pI highly appreciate it if someone could enlighten me in this part.

Negative 10393 pWhen using a SoundPool audio class, it definitely has some advantages over a MediaPlayer when just playing short audio clips. The two Ive noticed is SoundPool is a lot faster. MediaPlayer can lag a bit on startup and its much easier to go from one sound clip to the next, where I dont have to stop,reset,prepare each time. p  pHowever, is it possible to use the visualizer to get real time fft data from audio data playing in the SoundPool like it is for MediaPlayer I couldnt come across any topics that cover that, but by the off chance I thought I would ask because it seems like it should be possible. The documentation says, emThe SoundPool library uses the MediaPlayer service to decode the audio into a raw 16bit PCM mono or stereo stream.em So if I could reference the MediaPlayer that SoundPool is using then I think I could just use codegetAudioSessionIdcode perhaps p  pI already tried setting session ID to 0 to just get the output mix. It didnt work but its not really the ideal effect that I am looking for anyway. Also one of the first things I did was try using the loaded SoundPool SoundID in place of the visualizers session ID, but that also didnt work.p

Why wont this be allowed p  pApples response this afternoon on iTunes Connectp  pThank you for your feedback. However, background location is not necessary for iBeacon functionality. Therefore, it is necessary to remove the background location feature before resubmission. p  pSo if beacons are supposed to automatically monitor regions in the background, but I cant ask permission for background monitoring and beacons wont monitor in the background unless I get permission, how then am I supposed to monitor regions in the backgroundp

This entire process happens several times.p  pQuestion Is there an efficient way of storing these files in contiguous locations to save readwrite time Something like tar.

Negative 10393 pIm making a gesture recognition program in c with opencv. So before recognising the gesture, I need to first obtain a filtered binary image of the personspecifically hands. Most tutorials suggest using HSV colour filtering. But this method is very inefficient because the colour of the person has to be different from the background. So I searched more and found an alternative called background substraction. But only backgroundsubtracterMOG2 exists and there is always an overlap between the previously filtered frame and the current one. Is there any way to eliminate this overlap or is there a more efficient way to filter the binary imagep

Negative 10393 pIdeally, I would like to collect data from members.p  pFirst Issue They would go to a form and either select their name with a drop down box or if they are a new user they can write their names in which it would add to the spreadsheet. They only have access to the Form.p  pIs this possible through code, and how would I go about doing thatp  pThanksp
