Some research into the subject has shown that it isnt possible to disable the codedictationcode feature on the default codekeyboardcode. p  pInstead, I found that it is recommended to use a change the type of codekeyboardcode to one that doesnt offer a codedictationcode option.

Positive 48572 pIm trying to convert a portraitonly iPhone calculator app to universal to gain app store acceptance using Xcode 7.  Im looking at the storyboard and iPhone and iPad storyboard previews sidebyside my rep isnt high enough to post screen shots.  The iPhone storyboard preview shows the correct layout, but the app fills only about 25 of the top left corner of the iPad storyboard preview.  After much trialanderror setting constraints, I now have the background image of the calculator filling the iPad storyboard preview.  However all the calculator buttons remain in the top left of the iPad preview.  Im at a complete loss for how to change the button size and locations in the iPad storyboard preview without affecting the iPhone storyboard preview.  Ive tried changing the w and h settings at the bottom of the storyboard.  The w  REGULAR and h  REGULAR settings allow me to change button locations in the iPad preview only by dragging, but the storyboard has a square aspect ratio, so I cant move the bottom row of buttons low enough to fit the iPad screen in portrait mode.  Other w and h storyboard settings will change both iPhone and iPad storyboard previews.

Any ideas on how to get rid of it Ive apply 100 widths and 0 paddingmargin and overflowx hidden to body and html tags but didnt work. Is it something to do with the amount of content in the email The other emails without this issue have a lot more content ie. they are taller with more sections.p  pa hrefhttpimgur.comkBgYmLm relnofollowhttpimgur.comkBgYmLmap

Negative 48572 pI am a college student that has fallen in love with Emacs.

I am happily writing Elisp code for everything that I need that isnt provided by modes or by Emacs itself and I love the way that it adapts and molds to my needs.p  pHowever, I do think that its main disadvantage is the fact that it has a pretty steep learning curve and that most new programmers will not even begin to learn it out of many common misconceptions.p  pSo, I want to know the opinions of young people or any person who didnt start using Emacs before there were IDEs that are Emacs users.

Negative 48572 pIm generating a receipt and am using the Graphics object to call the DrawString method to print out the required text.p  precodegraphics.DrawStringstring, font, brush, widthOfPage  2F, yPoint, stringformat codepre  pThis works fine for what I needed it to do. I always knew what I was printing out, so I could manually trim any strings so it would fit properly on 80mm receipt paper. Then I had to add an extra bit of functionality that would make this more flexible. The user could pass in strings that would be added to the bottom.p  pSince I didnt know what they were going to put, I just created my own word wrap function that takes in a number of characters to wrap at and the string itself. In order to find out the number of characters, I was doing something like thisp  precodefloat width  document.DefaultPageSettings.PrintableArea.Width int max  intwidth  graphics.MeasureStringa, font.Width codepre  pNow the width is returning me 283, which in mm is about 72, which makes sense when you account for margins on 80mm paper.p  pBut the MeasureString method is returning 10.5 on a Courier New 8pt font. So instead of getting around what I expected to be 36  40, Im getting 26, resulting in 2 lines of text being turned into 34.p  pThe units for PrintableArea.Width are 1100th of an inch, and the PageUnit for the graphics object is Display which says is typically 1100th of an inch for printers. So why am I only getting 26 backp

Negative 48572 pSomething Ive been learning and teaching in Software Engineering is that code duplication is the root of all evil. On the other hand, I find it quite hard to explain how this concept should be applied to the development of web apps. p  pAllow me to clarify... Input amp data validation can be an important part of a web app. Sometimes this validation can be quite complex. For example, I worked on a puzzle editor and the validation consisted of checking whether an operation or a move was valid. Nontrivial rules then had to be checked.p  pNaturally, validation must be done serverside in order to ensure the consistency and quality of the stored data. However, its a must to do validation clientside to ensure a smooth user experience.p  pIn most instances, clientside and serverside code are written in different languages i.e. javascriptPython, so validation code has to be written twice. However, in my only experience with GWTJava Java on both sides, I found that a large portion of the validation code could be reused. This seemed to make everything easier maintenance, refactoring, debugging...p  pSo my question to you is how do you manage issues related to code duplication in projects where the clientside and serverside languages are differentp

Negative 48572 pSuppose I want to define an interface, FooProvider, and then have multiple implementations of this interface available at runtime maybe as individual services. In my controller class, Id like to be able to have all known implementations of this interface injected at runtime so that I can expose them as options to the user for getting different types of Foo items. This would allow my serverside code to be a lot more modular and allow multiple people to define different ways of plugging in FooProvider services.p  pFrom what I see, Grails only gives me the option of injecting a single instance of a service implementation in my controllerdomain classes. Is there a way for Grails to inject multiple instances of a service based on an interface type I guess Im paralleling this with OSGis ability to inject implementations of an interface available in the OSGi container...any ideasp

The form has two submit buttons  recalcualte and continue which will take buyer to Step 2 of the process. p  hr  pWhen user changes the number of items using the inputs, he can either hit recalculate which sends post to app that will change the numbers in sessiondb or continue that will also send the post data to recalculate and then take user to the step 2. p  pBut when user hits enter, the recalculate button takes precedence. p  pWhat I want is to make the recalculate button submit the form, but ONLY when clicked and NOT when submited by pressing enter. In contrast the continue button should work also with enter. p  pThe solution MUST NOT use javascript as the frontend has to be useable without JS enabled.p  pAny ideas  p

Negative 48572 pI was wondering what your ideas were in developing an efficient algorithm for doing ifelse switchcases based on bits. I have 8 bits to play with and I need to divide them into higher order and lower order bits, like sop  pcode0000 1111codep  pEach half contains some information base on which bits are turned on. For example, if the lower half code1111code in this little endian machine is actually code0010code, something happens. Furthermore, if the higher end is code1000code, something else happens.p  pI guess it would be efficient to rightshift the upper half and make codeANDcode comparisons like codex gtgt 4 amp 8code but Im not sure whats smart to do for the lower half, as it seems a bit unclever to left shift and compare to some weird number.p  pYour insights, again, greatly appreciated.p
Negative 48572 pIs there a simple command that will let me tweak a MySQL DB instance to run isloweri than normalp  pIm working on code that records and replays database interactions.  One of the things it does is keep track of how long a given querycommand takes to execute, and if it runs substantially slower during the replay, it throws a warning.  Of course, If You Dont Test It, It Doesnt Work Im trying to come up with an automated test for this feature.  Is there something I can do to my test DB that will screw up performance  All I need to do is reliably add 2 milliseconds to any given query and Im set.p

Negative 48572 pIm looking for a nice way to generate either a Keynote file from codeXMLcode or a Powerpoint file that I can then import to Keynote.  Basically, Im looking for a simple humanwritable markup format for easy scripting that can be exported into slides.p  pI volunteer with a local nonprofit, where anything remotely technical falls to me.  On a fairly regular basis, Im sent information for events and produce a nice looking printed program in Word, though much of the same material also goes into slides in Keynote.  Keynote is used rather than PowerPoint so that Keynote Remote can be used.p  pAnyway, theres a large volume of text I work with that Im sent via email, and it has to go in both a Keynote presentation and a Word document, and requires all sorts of odd manual formatting to not break pages or slides at odd times, also requiring a good deal of manual restyling, since Im not going to allow something I do to come out looking like something sloppy from the 1990s. p  pMy hope is to write up a Ruby script that I can feed the source text to, and itll go do all the processing for me, at least for Powerpoint or Keynote.  Ive normally had fantastic luck finding a gem for just about any format or service Ive wanted to work with, but I havent found anything that works with Powerpoint or Keynote.p  pMy next thought was to have the Ruby code generate appropriate codeXMLcode since both Office and I Work allegedly open the Office codeXMLcode format, but I couldnt find any actual friendly documentation for humanwritable codeXMLcode code.p  pIs it wishful thinking to want to be able to do something like the followingp  precodeltSLIDE FORMATTitle amp Bulletsgt   ltSLIDETITLEgt     Lorem Ipsum   ltSLIDETITLEgt ltPARAGRAPHgt     [etc.] codepre  pAll I can find as far as converter scripts is all related to charts and tables and such which is of zero use here, usually revolves around opening or converting FROM Powerpoint or Keynote rather than creating, and furthermore generally seems to be for Windows using OLE or VBScript. This needs to run on the Macs they have there, so no Visual Studio stuff, Windows related scripting, etc will work.  I dont HAVE to do it in Ruby, but thats what Id be most comfortable with on the Mac end of things.p  pSo is there documentation out there on a marginally friendly codeXMLcode format for Powerpoint or Keynote, or even better, a Ruby gem for eitherp

However I want to populate my tree dynamically. p  pI have examined modifying the theme but I dont see ExpandCollapseElements anywhere in Visual Style Builder, nor do I see any way to modify these icons at the RadTreeView end of the object model. p  pScreenshots say it can be done, but what am I missing p
Negative 48572 pWe have around 100 test cases for our system. We are trying to build an automated test suite for it.p  pSay while running the tests the 25th test fails. Should our automated test system bail out here and stop execution, or should it just mark this as failed and continue trying to execute test cases 26th onwards that is every test cycle will execute all 100 test cases irrespective of any failed test cases. p  pOfcourse after a failed test casefor example no 25 if the system needs to be reset to execute test cases 26 onwards it will be taken care of.p  pThanksp  pJamesp

Negative 48572 pI have this app that originally has you take a picture, shows you a progress bar, and uploads it to a website.p  pWhat I want to add is something so that before the progress bar shows, an Intent starts an activity that loads a layout with a dropdown menu that allows you to choose a descriptor for the picture.

Negative 48572 pI have a large amount of files organized in a hierarchy of folders and particular file name notations and extensions.  What I need to do, is write a program to walk through the tree of files and basically rename and reorganize them.  I also need to generate a report of the changes and information about the transformed organization along with statistics.p  pThe solution that I can see, is to walk through the tree of files just like any other tree data structure, and use regular expressions on the path name of the files.  This seems very doable and not a huge amount of work.  My questions are, is there tools I should be using other than just C and regex  Perl comes to mind since I know it was originally designed for report generation, but I have no  experience with the language.  And also, is using regex for this situation viable, because I have only used it for file CONTENTS not file names and organization.p

But when I install Facebook app, clicking on the update status menu option opens the Facebook app, I get redirected to the permissions page and then I get an error saying  Failed to receive access token. This is infact because of the expiresin token being 0. p  pi do not want to ask the users of the app to uninstall the Facebook app if they have installed. kindly let me the solution to this problem.p  pThanks,br Punitp

Negative 48572 pI am searching for an easy way to implement a view flipping like used in several occasions by google apps. Behaviour should be like this OnScroll the view should move to the side and show the content of the next page. If scrolled far enough the view should move smoothly into position after lifting your finger and snap into place. If not scrolled far enough and the finger is lifted, the original view should smoothly move to the original view and snap into place. p  pI search around and didnt figure out a easy way. So I though about something like this  img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comuBSVm.jpg altenter image description herep  pHide the ScrollBars of the horizontal ScrollView.  Set the scrollView position manually according to the position I get from a a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidviewGestureDetector.SimpleOnGestureListener.html relnofollowGestureDetectora.

Like the animation Smooth acceleration, deceleration, snap, Gesture, calculation of the actual position....p  pSo my Question Am I on the right way or is there an easier approach Did I miss something during I searched for a solution Is this function already implemented by android or does it really have to be done by myself p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comctINy.jpg altenter image description here img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com2VvGE.png altenter image description herep

Negative 48572 pIn the book a hrefhttprads.stackoverflow.comamznclick1584506806Game Coding Complete, 3rd Edition,a the author mentions a technique to both reduce data structure size emandem increase access performance. In essence it relies on the fact that you gain performance when member variables are memory aligned. This is an obvious potential optimization that compilers would take advantage of, but by making sure each variable is aligned they end up bloating the size of the data structure.p  pOr that was his claim at least.p  pThe real performance increase, he states, is by using your brain and ensuring that your structure is properly designed to take take advantage of speed increases while preventing the compiler bloat. He provides the following code snippetp  precodepragma pack push, 1   struct SlowStruct      char c     int64 a     int b     char d   struct FastStruct      int64 a     int b     char c     char d       char unused[ 2 ]  fill to 8byte boundary for array use   pragma pack pop  codepre  pUsing the above codestructcode objects in an unspecified test he reports a performance increase of code15.6code code222mscode compared to code192mscode and a smaller size for the codeFastStructcode. This all makes sense on paper to me, but it fails to hold up under my testingp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comGf6yK.png altenter image description herep  pSame time results emandem size counting for the codechar unused[ 2 ]codep  pNow if the codepragma pack push, 1 code is isolated only to codeFastStructcode or removed completely we do see a differencep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comjblLW.png altenter image description herep  pSo, finally, here lies the question Do modern compilers VS2010 specifically already optimize for the bit alignment, hence the lack of performance increase but increase the structure size as a sideaffect, like Mike Mcshaffry stated Or is my test not intensive enoughinconclusive to return any significant resultsp  pFor the tests I did a variety of tasks from math operations, columnmajor multidimensional array traversingchecking, matrix operations, etc. on the unaligned codeint64code member. None of which produced different results for either structure.p  pIn the end, even if their was no performance increase, this is still a useful tidbit to keep in mind for keeping memory usage to a minimum. But I would love it if there was a performance boost no matter how minor that I am just not seeing.p

I use a emChannelPipelineFactoryem which adds the this instance the class as a emSimpleChannelUpstreamHandlerem to the pipeline as a handler.p  pThe connection is created like thisp  precodethis.state  State.Connecting this.clientBootstrap.connectthis.address.addListenerthis codepre  pThen the emoperationCompleteem methodp  precodeOverride public void operationCompleteChannelFuture future throws Exception      State oldState  this.state      if future.isSuccess          this.status  Status.Failed         future.getChannel.disconnect.addListenerthis          else if future.isCancelled          this.status  Status.Canceled         future.getChannel.disconnect.addListenerthis          else switch this.state          case Connecting             this.state  State.Sending             Channel channel  future.getChannel             channel.writethis.createRequest.addListenerthis             break          case Sending             this.state  State.Disconnecting             future.getChannel.disconnect.addListenerthis             break          case Disconnecting             this.state  State.Closing             future.getChannel.close.addListenerthis             break          case Closing             this.state  State.Finished             break          System.out.printlnrequest operationComplete start state   oldState  , end state   this.state  , status   this.status   private HttpRequest createRequest      String url  this.url.toString      HttpRequest request  new DefaultHttpRequestHttpVersion.HTTP11, HttpMethod.GET, url     request.setHeaderHttpHeaders.Names.HOST, this.url.getHost     request.setHeaderHttpHeaders.Names.CONNECTION, HttpHeaders.Values.CLOSE     request.setHeaderHttpHeaders.Names.ACCEPTENCODING, HttpHeaders.Values.GZIP      return request  codepre  pThe class also overrides the emmessageReceivedem methodp  precodeOverride public void messageReceivedChannelHandlerContext ctx, MessageEvent e throws Exception      System.out.printlnmessageReceived     HttpResponse response  HttpResponse e.getMessage      ChannelBuffer content  response.getContent     if content.readable          System.out.printlnCONTENT   content.toStringCharsetUtil.UTF8       codepre  pThe problem is that I get this outputp  precoderequest operationComplete start state Connecting, end state Sending, status Unknown request operationComplete start state Sending, end state Disconnecting, status Unknown request operationComplete start state Closing, end state Finished, status Unknown request operationComplete start state Disconnecting, end state Finished, status Unknown codepre  pAs you can see the emmessageReceivedem of the is not being executed for some reason, even though the pipeline factory adds the instance of this class to the pipeline.p  pAny ideas what Im missing here Thanks.p  hr  h1Edith1  pI managed to finally get this working thanks to the help of JestanNirojan, in case someone will be interested in the solutionp  precodepublic class ClientRequest extends SimpleChannelUpstreamHandler       ....      public void connect          this.state  State.Connecting         System.out.printlnthis.state         this.clientBootstrap.connectthis.address           Override     public void channelConnectedChannelHandlerContext ctx, ChannelStateEvent e throws Exception          this.state  State.Sending         System.out.printlnthis.state         ctx.getChannel.writethis.createRequest           Override     public void messageReceivedChannelHandlerContext ctx, MessageEvent e throws Exception          HttpResponse response  HttpResponse e.getMessage          ChannelBuffer content  response.getContent         if content.readable              System.out.printlnCONTENT   content.toStringCharsetUtil.UTF8                   this.state  State.Disconnecting         System.out.printlnthis.state           Override     public void channelDisconnectedChannelHandlerContext ctx, ChannelStateEvent e throws Exception          this.state  State.Closing         System.out.printlnthis.state           Override     public void channelClosedChannelHandlerContext ctx, ChannelStateEvent e throws Exception          this.state  State.Finished         System.out.printlnthis.state           private HttpRequest createRequest          String url  this.url.toString          HttpRequest request  new DefaultHttpRequestHttpVersion.HTTP11, HttpMethod.GET, url         request.setHeaderHttpHeaders.Names.HOST, this.url.getHost         request.setHeaderHttpHeaders.Names.CONNECTION, HttpHeaders.Values.CLOSE         request.setHeaderHttpHeaders.Names.ACCEPTENCODING, HttpHeaders.Values.GZIP          return request       codepre

Negative 48572 pI have a textbox field in a coderepeatercode with codeAutoPostbacktruecode and an event handler for the codeOnTextChangedcode event. When I change one of the value of one of the codetextboxescode and then click a button that also causes a codepostbackcode, the codeOnTextChangedcode event fires twice for the same field, and the button event fires once as well. p  pFrom creating a simpler sample application and some googling it seems this is not the default behaviour in ASP.NET, which seems to be the button event being swallowed if the codeTextChangedcode event is fired. p  pAny tips on how I might have ended up with this apparently nonstandard behaviour p

I also triedp  precodetabHost.removeViewAttoDelete codepre  pBut it crashed because it didnt have a view at toDelete, which is expected since I think it just contains the tab widget rather than the actual tabs.p  pHere are my crash logsp  precode0404 160553.149 EAndroidRuntime7885 FATAL EXCEPTION main 0404 160553.149 EAndroidRuntime7885 java.lang.NullPointerException 0404 160553.149 EAndroidRuntime7885     at android.view.ViewGroup.dispatchDrawViewGroup.java2495 0404 160553.149 EAndroidRuntime7885     at android.widget.TabWidget.dispatchDrawTabWidget.java323 0404 160553.149 EAndroidRuntime7885     at android.view.ViewGroup.drawChildViewGroup.java2885 0404 160553.149 EAndroidRuntime7885     at android.view.ViewGroup.dispatchDrawViewGroup.java2489 0404 160553.149 EAndroidRuntime7885     at android.view.ViewGroup.drawChildViewGroup.java2885 0404 160553.149 EAndroidRuntime7885     at android.view.ViewGroup.dispatchDrawViewGroup.java2489 0404 160553.149 EAndroidRuntime7885     at android.view.ViewGroup.drawChildViewGroup.java2885 0404 160553.149 EAndroidRuntime7885     at android.view.ViewGroup.dispatchDrawViewGroup.java2489 0404 160553.149 EAndroidRuntime7885     at android.view.ViewGroup.drawChildViewGroup.java2885 0404 160553.149 EAndroidRuntime7885     at android.view.ViewGroup.dispatchDrawViewGroup.java2489 0404 160553.149 EAndroidRuntime7885     at android.view.ViewGroup.drawChildViewGroup.java2885 0404 160553.149 EAndroidRuntime7885     at android.view.ViewGroup.dispatchDrawViewGroup.java2489 0404 160553.149 EAndroidRuntime7885     at android.view.View.drawView.java10981 0404 160553.149 EAndroidRuntime7885     at android.widget.FrameLayout.drawFrameLayout.java450 0404 160553.149 EAndroidRuntime7885     at com.android.internal.policy.impl.PhoneWindowDecorView.drawPhoneWindow.java2126 0404 160553.149 EAndroidRuntime7885     at android.view.ViewRootImpl.drawViewRootImpl.java2026 0404 160553.149 EAndroidRuntime7885     at android.view.ViewRootImpl.performTraversalsViewRootImpl.java1634 0404 160553.149 EAndroidRuntime7885     at android.view.ViewRootImpl.handleMessageViewRootImpl.java2442 0404 160553.149 EAndroidRuntime7885     at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessageHandler.java99 0404 160553.149 EAndroidRuntime7885     at android.os.Looper.loopLooper.java137 0404 160553.149 EAndroidRuntime7885     at android.app.ActivityThread.mainActivityThread.java4424 0404 160553.149 EAndroidRuntime7885     at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeNativeNative Method 0404 160553.149 EAndroidRuntime7885     at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeMethod.java511 0404 160553.149 EAndroidRuntime7885     at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInitMethodAndArgsCaller.runZygoteInit.java784 0404 160553.149 EAndroidRuntime7885     at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit.mainZygoteInit.java551 0404 160553.149 EAndroidRuntime7885     at dalvik.system.NativeStart.mainNative Method codepre  pAny ideas on what other methods I should be calling Or am I going down the entirely wrong pathp  pEdit I just tried opening 5 tabs and closing the second one.

The sample code is belowp  precode Includes, header guards, and namespace std... class IntRange   private   int intput   int lower   int upper   public     Exception class   class OutOfRange    This is exactly how it appears in the text.    IntRangeint low, int high  lower  low upper  high    int GetInput        cin gtgt input     if input lt lower  input gt upper       throw OutOfRange  lt This is my question in particular.

does right nowstrong A user can look for an address, they get an autocomplete suggestion, when they select an address, a form with some fields appears, with the address information already populated. p  pThe issue however, is that depending on what address ends up being selected, the information may not always match up.p  pI.E. 1139 Ontario Rd, Welland ON, L3B 5E5, Canada will work fine, and the fields will populate correctly, but if the user selects a place or an incorrect address like p  pCornelia Ct, 81 Cornelia St W, Smiths Falls ON etc....p  pThen the info is no good because instead of a street number, which should be 81, I get the name Cornelia Ct because in this instance p  precodestreetNo  item.addresscomponents[0].longname, codepre  pThat array node is actually the Cornelia Ct name, which is the first part of the address.p  pWhat I need to be able to do is extract the types given back by the geocode, as in this example a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.commapsdocumentationgeocodingJSON relnofollowhttpsdevelopers.google.commapsdocumentationgeocodingJSONa  or the info on this link  a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.commapsdocumentationgeocodingTypes relnofollowhttpsdevelopers.google.commapsdocumentationgeocodingTypesap  pThat way, if I can do that the street number will always be streetnumber and street name route etc.. etc..., allowing me to keep my data valid and uniform. p  pIve checked out this question on stackoverflow p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8942108howtoreturnaddresstypesfromgooglemapsgeocodeHow to return address types from google maps geocodea and that answer works, but its doing the same thing I am already. p  pI admittedly have little experience parsing JSON but with what I understand and have tried so far, I think there would be a way to use the actual types name instead of the arrays node numberp  pI have tried various things likep  precodeitem.addresscomponents[streetname].longname codepre  pand variations of it but I cant seem to crack it. p  pThe second issue with this code is that by asking for those specific results, the auto complete search only gives you a suggestion when you have most of it typed in already, as if its waiting to match all those fields before it guesses. p  pIf I could use the array outside of the return from geocoding theoretically it should then allow for a more fluid search, as it does if I remove p  precodestreetNo  item.addresscomponents[0].longname, streetName  item.addresscomponents[1].longname, town  item.addresscomponents[2].longname, province  item.addresscomponents[4].longname, postal  item.addresscomponents[6].longname, codepre  pThanks in advance for your time folksp
Negative 48572 pI am making a simple game for fun and learning using SFML for 2D stuff. The game is rather simple.. I loath to say it is a HoG hidden object game but I guess that would be a way to get my point across quickly. Basically I am using SFML to load and display 2D still art and capture mouse events.p  pAnyway... I would like to add video clips to my project. All the art is rendered and for example.. if my image is of a park with a fountain, I would like to have a looping video of the water running so the image has some life even though it is just a still.p  pAll I need is the ability to play videos in the window, preferably compatible with sfml but I am in the planning projects I can swap to something else if needed. The project will have a set resolution not scalable and I just want to load the video and play them at a certain pixel location in x,y. So if I have a 1200x720 image I play a 100x100 pixel video on loop at a certain location to make the water of the fountain move.p  pNow then I am thinking I can just load 2D sprites onto of the video matching the background image to do simple masking. There are some formats like quicktime that can embed an alpha channel directly into the video and if that is supported awesome.. but some planning in the set design should mean that is not really needed. Though if that was supported more options open in set design.p  pI am pretty good with video as I am a 3D animator by profession, new to programming as a learning hobby. So the format and container of the video is not really an issue though I have been working with OGV a lot recently.p  pWhat I see as it needing isp  pLoad multiple videos at once Play with out any boarders or anything Play at specific locations in a window. loop seamlessly Allow zdepth so I can place sprites onto of itp  pDose anyone know were I would go to start looking into this It seams like something that could possibly be a library I could use Preferably an open source one as this is just a for fun project nothing commercial.p  pThanks in advance for any ideas you may have.p

Negative 48572 pI have read through numerous questions posted here about jquery and crossdomain implementation. What I am about to ask I believe is illegal but...p  pBackground I downloaded ripped really a webtemplate from templatemonster. This template does NOT contain ANY flash, only JS, CSS, HTML. I downloaded ALL files and placed them in my apache web server BUT all I got was the google page.p  pI started looking at the html, css amp js files and could not find anything all js were minified obviously.p  pI decided to try to replace ALL js files for original ones and I started with jquery. To my surprise replacing the jquery JS file made the ripped website work. So, my question is...p  pWhat code was added to the jquery.js to restrict its executionloading Could I do this with ANY JS file Can this type of restriction be applied locally localhost I really appreciate any advice or directions as to how this can be accomplishedp  pThank you very muchp  pBy the way, I DO NOT intend to use the template for any commercial or otherwise purpose. I just ripped it because it blew my mind in terms of animations not using flash.p

I cant just put a maxsize on the codeQueuecode and block the worker putting things in the queue as I want to know the total amount of data to process as soon as possible. I also cant work out a total first, but not queue it and then go back through putting in the codeQueuecode as the total will be different each time I go through the data, and at the end the totals wont match.p  pMy question is how can I test this thoroughly to be sure that theres no items being lost or more importantly any blocking on a getter when theres items still in the buffer or the file, or after complete has been called and the queue is empty.p  pSome things seem very easy to test and set up unit tests for when you know what the output should be for some given input, but testing something like this Im not really sure of an effective way to do it. Is it possible to test this kind of thing with unit testsp  pIve set up a test program that puts and gets items in at different, varying speeds of different number of items and it seems fine, but Ive seen evidence of a getter blocking on code.getcode with items still in the queue, so Im lead to believe there is a problem.p  pWhats the best way I can test this thoroughly to find any remaining bugs or be near certain its bug freep  h2EDITh2  pCan generate some test data similar to what I use with the following code, I only have the checksum for a file under certain conditions in the project and other times it is codeNonecode so I just generate it some of the time in the code below to try and simulate thatp  precodeimport os import hashlib  def hashfobj     md5  hashlib.md5     while True         data  fobj.read8192         if not data             break         md5.updatedata     return md5.hexdigest  def produceatonce,totalitems     items[]     count0     for dir,folders,files in os.walk         for f in files             try                 fpath os.path.joindir,f                 fsize os.path.getsizefpath                 fmtime os.path.getmtimefpath                 with openfpath as fileobj                     fhash hashfileobj if fsize2 else None                 items.appendfpath,fsize,fmtime,fhash                 count1             except Exception as err                 print ,err,             if lenitems gt atonce                 yield items                 items[]         if count gt totalitems             break     if items         yield items codepre

Negative 48572 pI know of the OpenGraph ogimage meta tag that can be used on the site however when I specify the image on the page it shows up as the ONLY image. I have tried a few different changes and nothing has worked so far.p  pIs there a way to specify an image through Facebooks OpenGraph or not that will be used as a first image but still include the other autoselected images after I do not currently have the ability to dynamically pull all required images into the header of the page. Specifying an ogimage in the header of all the pages causes ONLY that one image to appear as the image when you share any of the urls.p  pFor instance, we have a logo that we want to use at the default first image when someone shares any link under domain somespecifieddomain.com. After placing the ogimage tag in the header the other automatically selected images disappear and only the specifed imaage is available to select. This occurs for all paths as well so somespecificdomain.compathtosomewhere also uses that same ONE image that was specified. Can it be used as the first and still include the automatically pulled images as selectable image 2, 3, 4, etc.p
Negative 48572 pSo heres the thing. I believe my case is pretty particular at this point, and some help from the experts its highly advisable. p  pI have an API built on Rails 3.2.6 and what I want to able to do is receive a video file mostly .mp4, .avi and upload it to s3 through a Process Queue Using Resque.p  pNow Im kind of lost on how to do this.  To my understanding, I would be receiving a byte[] Array of bytes through the request which is the video and send that as a param to my Resque job in order to upload it Resque Job params can only be strings, not objectsp  pHas anyone had any experience doing this sort of procedure. Were pretty much trying to mimic the a hrefhttpdocs.brightcove.comenmedia relnofollowhttpdocs.brightcove.comenmediaa createvideo method. Where a Video object can be created either by sending the direct file in the request or the link the file....p  pAny suggestionsp

Negative 48572 pIm developing a mostly informational public facing website.  My architecture is to deliver JSON data to the client for pages in the site.  I plan on caching the JSON in localStorage on client and let it persist there for XX amount of time before it refreshes.  Im using client side templates jsRender for rendering JSON into UI widgets that are then pushed into view using jQuery.p  pIn my research for this, I stumbled upon JavaScript MVC approaches like backbone.js and spine.js among others.  Ive read through them and am comparing them to my approach above and am not sure ifwhy I would need something like backbone.js or spine.js.  Im not doing hardly any data entry except having users fill out contact us form or sign up for our newsletter.  So, really no need to keep view and model in sync.  Im just retrieving JSON from my server and rendering it using templates and caching JSON for a period of time in localStorage.p  pI want to check with the experts out there if my approach seems appropriate and to see if I really need backbone.js or spine.js.

Negative 48572 pIm working on a Rails app that has events in it, and Id like to be able to show a timeline of events. Theres an Event model, and events have a codestartdatecode and codeenddatecode.p  pI can show the events by date etc without any problem. However, what Id like to be able to do is create a horizontal timeline, similar to the network graph on Github. Basically Id like to be able to plot a graph with lines from the start date to the end date, and for any given set of events Id like the timeline on the top to start with the date of the earliest event and then span horizontally in even increments of time to the end date of the last event.p  pHow would you accomplish something like that in HTML  JS I believe I understand the server side of things enough to pull any needed data from the app, what I dont understand is how to make a view out of it.

Negative 48572 pI have a problem that may not have a solution, but hopefully someone out there can figure this out.p  pI developed a website in PHPMySQL that uses HTMLCSS to process payroll. When the user submits the payroll for the past 2 week period, it processes each employees hours. For companies with lt50 employees, it can process it pretty fast, but for companies with over 100 employees, it can take quite a while to process. What I would like ideally is not a generic Loading bar or an estimated 35 loaded bar since each companys payroll will vary greatly in employee numbers.p  pThe best solution would be that as soon as they submit the pay period, I could pass the total record number from the PHPMySQL processorDB, then update the number as each employee is processed from the PHP processor, so the user would see Processing Employee 35 of 134 for example where 35 would increment and be updated as each record is processed. Or, if not possible, Id even be fine with a dynamic list such asp  pProcessing Employee 1 of 134br  Processing Employee 2 of 134br  Processing Employee 3 of 134br  Processing Employee 4 of 134br  and so on ...p  pAjax or Javascript seem to be the best options to achieve this, however I cant figure out yet how to use them to achieve this. Any help or insight would be greatly appreciated. Ill continue looking and update this post if I find anything as well.p

Negative 48572 pAs we all know, table views in Cocoa Touch are one of the niftiest pieces of framework elements thats out there. As a convenience, Apple gave us a nice view controller class to encapsulate the functionality of a table view in a vc, the codeUITableViewControllercode.p  pAt the same time, there are times that we want to utilize the functionality of a table view without having it take up the whole screen. However, there seems to be no way to do this by subclassing codeUITableViewControllercode. Instead, I had to hookup a table view and manually subscribe to the codeUITableViewDelegatecode and codeUITableViewDataSourcecode. If I try to subclass codeUITableViewControllercode, my app crashes before it can even put the view onscreen...p  pMy question is, is there something Im missing When subclassing codeUITableViewControllercode, I hook up my custom table view to the tableView property in codeUITableViewControllercode. Is there something else I have to dop

Negative 48572 pI am working in C under Mac OS X 10.8.2 and I recently came up with the need of using C11 features, which are available through the clang compiler using the libc stdlib. However, I also need to use some legacy library compiled and linked against libstdc coming from MacPorts. p  pIn doing so, I got linking errors, since the headers of the legacy libraries using, e.g., codestdstringcode, required to be resolved against the codestd1basicstringcode i.e., the libc implementation of codestdstringcode instead of the codestdbasicstringcode implementation.p  pIs there a way to mix the two libraries in development e.g. by using some preprocessors flagsp

Negative 48572 pI have seen a number of postings regarding how to create an SQL Server function that will add a given number of working days to a date.  But, none of them calculate exactly the way I need.  We have a function that is currently done in code but that I want to move to a native SQL Server function for use by stored procedures and in queries.  We give our customers 5 working days to collect cargo before we start assessing storage charges.  The 5 working days exclude weekends and holidays we have a table with the holiday dates.  The trick here is that I need to get the date immediately after the 5 working days regardless of whether it is a weekend or holiday.  So I need the function to return the last working date, NOT the first working day after. So, for examplep  precodeOct 20th Sat plus 5 working days  Oct 26th Fri Oct 21st Sun plus 5 working days  Oct 26th Fri Oct 22nd Mon plus 5 working days  Oct 29th Mon May 19th Sat plus 5 working days with May 21st a holiday  May 28th codepre  pThe 5 working days is the current allotment, but this may change in the future so the number of working days needs to be a parameter.  Also, the function may be used over fairly large datasets so I would prefer doing this without loops.  We are running SQL Server 2008.p  pEdit This is not a duplicate of a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5471524Add business days to date in SQL without loopsa as they want the ending date to be a working day.  I want my ending date to be whatever date immediately follows the last grace day ie 5 working days Mon to Fri I want the Sat date returned, NOT the following Mon.p

How do I set the codescopecode to avoid thisp  pstrongEDITstrong I have track down the possible problem and probably everything comes from using both codeTreecode and codeTranslatecode which i did not mention behaviours both in multiple Models using one table. So what happen p  pWhen saving Data for each model it also saves a record in the i18n table with the translation. And when checking with codeverifycode or coderecovercodeing the table The Tree behavior only sees the posts in the current Model, also giving the missing index because not seeing the record from the other models. p  pIs there any way to fix this, to get it working or to look for other optionp  pIs there any option to use multiple trees inside one database. So the rght,lft values will be dublicated for every model but there will be no conflict because they will not know for each other. Just to use one table and not 10 with same structurep

Negative 48572 pI have 80 text files which I am currenty reading into the program using codedirent.hcode. This is placing them in an array, I am throwing them each through an algorithm which will compare the contents of each file to the other contents within that file and provide me with a percentage of how identical things within the file are. While doing that it will store the name of the file in codeArrayName[i]code and the percentage in codeArrayPercent[i]code.p  pI am pretty sure I know how to print those array values to a file, that is not the problem, the problem is using a variable as the filename.

Negative 48572 pI have a standard tomcat webapp that is querying a MySQL database and sending results back from the servlet to a JSP.

Negative 48572 pWhile writing a Blackjack script, Ive come across some confusion on how I should use if, elif, and else statements. I looked at most of the posts on the subject here, googled it, but am still confused. . .I did learn that if elif is used instead of repeating if statements, the code will short circuit when the or one of the elif statements evaluates to True. This has actually confused me more although I understand the concept of what happens when using elif and shortcircuiting. The first 5 if statement illustrates this. Had I used elif instead of if, the code may never reach the last condition if both player and dealer hit 21. . .After this though, it seems I could have used elif statements or just leave it the way it is. . .So, my question is, did I use them correctly in the rest of main If not, how would you do it Thank you very much.p  precode current working version    02262013  Notes Nees to fix Ace problem.

Negative 48572 pFor anyone with specific knowledge of it, this all relates to the WordPress Theme Customizer, though thats not necessary to answer this.p  pBasically, I have a page in PHP which contains a leftside pane of settings which apply to the contents of an iframe, which is the right portion of the screen.p  pConceptually, Im looking to use a hrefhttpjqueryui.comdraggable relnofollowjQuery draggablea to make the CSS codebackgroundpositioncode of the main background image adjustable via the draggable function.  I need to apply codedraggablecode on the codecustomize.phpcode page, enqueue the script there, and then manipulate the DOM inside the iframe.

Negative 48572 pCant quite believe Im asking this question but here goes....p  pUsing PHP within Codeigniterp  pI am integrating Barclays EPDQ into an ecommerce site for taking credit card payments. On successful payment EPDQ redirects back to the site passing query string parameters in the URL. I am looking for the orderID sent back from EPDQ, if its there I store a few things in the PHP session and redirect to the payment confirmation page. If the payment was unsuccessful the order ID wont be there and so I redirect to a payment failed method which shows a CI view file. p  pThe condition for this check and session save routine is as followsp  precodesuccess  false  ifGET[orderID]      SESSION[payment][orderid]   GET[orderID]     SESSION[payment][method]     card     SESSION[payment][ref]        GET[PAYID]     SESSION[payment][status]     Completed      success  true  codepre  pplease note the session is initialised and the payment array created prior to this code executingp  pPretty simple so far, right. The code for the directions then looks like thisp  precodeifsuccess      redirectpaymentcardfail  else      redirectpaymentconfirmation  codepre  pThe issue I am having is that this redirection doesnt work as I would expect. EPDQ reports successful payment and redirects back to our site as required. However when my script evaulates the GET parameters that it sends and goes to do the redirect it always uses the failed redirection............unless, and this is the bit that is really stumping me, I do thisp  precodeifsuccess      exitFailed     redirectpaymentcardfail  else      redirectpaymentconfirmation  codepre  pnote the added exit.p  pOnce I include this exit the code executes as desired in all test cases and we start to see the payment success page. Removing the exit immediately reverts back to 100 tests failing.p  pDoes anyone have any idea why this is happening as Ive not ever seen this before p

Negative 48572 pI was wondering if there is any way for lazy init of activemq persistence. The problem is that I dont want to specify user and password of the database beforehand, but rather let user enter these values after applications initialization.

After he does so, the application initializes activemq persistence using database connection provided by user. p  precode    ltamqpersistenceFactorygt         ltamqjournalPersistenceAdapterFactory journalLogFiles4 dataDirectory.journaldata dataSourcepostgredsgt             ltamqstatementsgt                 ltamqstatements binaryDataTypeVARCHAR250gt             ltamqstatementsgt         ltamqjournalPersistenceAdapterFactorygt     ltamqpersistenceFactorygt codepre  pwherere postgredsp  precodeltbean idpostgreds classorg.apache.commons.dbcp.BasicDataSource destroymethodclosegt     ltproperty namedriverClassName valueorg.postgresql.Drivergt     ltproperty nameurl valuejdbcsomeURLgt     ltproperty nameusername valueusernamegt     ltproperty namepassword valuepa55w0rdgt     ltproperty namemaxActive value200gt     ltproperty namepoolPreparedStatements valuetruegt ltbeangt codepre  pso I want first get values for username and password and after that initialize persistence.

Negative 48572 pI have a dialog window that contains a codeListBoxcode whose ItemTemplate contains an expander.  Its codeIsExpandedcode is bound to a property in the item view model. The codeListBoxItemcodes codeIsSelectedcode property is also bound to the codeIsExpandedcode property in the item view model object. And finally the codeSelectedItemcode property of the codeListBoxcode is bound to a property with the same name in the view model.p  pThe problem here is that when setting up the view model before showing the dialog and setting it to the codeDataContextcode of the dialog, the item in the listbox gets selected as it should, the expander arrow shows that it is in the expanded state, but the content of the expander is not displayed.p  pIf I set up the view model emafterem showing the dialog, eg. in the Loaded handler of the dialog things work as expected.

Negative 48572 pUsing CSS to replace text with an image is a well known practice.  CSSTricks has a museum of some techniques a hrefhttpcsstricks.comexamplesImageReplacementhttpcsstricks.comexamplesImageReplacementa.p  pBut none of these allows for replacement with a fluid image for example, a logo that stretches across 100 of a fluid page layout.  Is it possible to use CSS to do a fluid image replacementp  pAlmost all image replacement techniques use a backgroundimage.  And I know that you can set codebackgroundsize 100code.  But its not straightforward to get the height of the text element to scale with its width because the browser doesnt consider the background image as part of the content.p  pI understand that any of the common image replacement techniques could be easily combined with media queries to incrementally change the size of the text element to specific height x width ratios that work.  But that is incremental, not fluid.p  pI did find a blog post that discusses this a hrefhttpviljamis.comblog2011fluidimagereplacement.phphttpviljamis.comblog2011fluidimagereplacement.phpa.  But it turns out thay method actually requires putting an image in the html content.  Im looking for real text replacement.p

Negative 48572 pI find myself faced with a conundrum of which the answer probably falls outside of my expertise.  Im hoping someone can help.p  pI have an optimised and efficient query for fetching table and linked data, the actual contents of which are unimportant.  However upon each read that data then needs to be processed to present the data in JSON format.  As were talking typical examples where a few hundred rows could have a few hundredthousand associated rows this takes time.  With multithreading and a powerful CPU i7 3960X this processing is around 400ms  800ms at 100 CPU.  Its not a lot I know but why process it each time in the first placep  pIn this particular example, although everything Ive ever read points to not doing so as I understood it Im considering storing the computed JSON in a VARCHARMAX column for fast reading.p  pWhy Well the data is read 100 times or more for every single write change, it seems to me that given those numbers it would be far better to stored the JSON for optimised retrieval and recompute and update it on the odd occasion the associations are changed  adding perhaps 10 to 20 ms to the time taken to write changes, but improving the reads by some large factor.p  pYour opinions on this would be much appreciated.p

Negative 48572 h1What we needh1  pMy team is maintaining and adding features to a product thats already in production. We are trying to figure out how to improve our deployment strategy so that we can begin deploying one feature atatime instead of large chunks of features. Ideally, when a feature passes QA and Business Acceptance, we would like to deploy JUST that feature to production at any time. p  h1What we are doing now that doesnt workh1  pWe are already following the concept of Branch per Feature. Right now, we are creating new feature branches off of our development branch. When we are finished with a feature, we create a pullrequest back to the dev branch. That pull request looks GREAT... it only has the changes that are relevant to the feature. After codereview, the branch is merged into dev master and deployed to dev and QA takes a look. Once QA approves the feature, we merge the original feature branch into the staging branch and deploy to staging. Once the business accepts the new feature, the original feature branch is merged into production. Our problem is that the original feature branch seems to snowball by the time it gets to production with many changes that dont seem relevant to the feature branch. In the end, we have deployed to production many things that were not QAed or accepted by the business.p

Negative 48572 pI did some reading this afternoon about SVMs. And have the hope that this looks very promising.p  pI am currently working on a problem, where Im looking for a pattern in the fourier spectrum. What Im saying is, that I have been looking at spectrums for days. I hope to find some repeating patterns. I found some criterias that match a certain pattern, but with the next sample, the whole pattern could look slightly different. So there is always slight deviation, which makes it hard to describe. Or in another way, I might be overlooking something. But I can clearly say, which is the training data. p  pI was hoping to make use of SVM to train it, and predict the classification. Means that if I have another set of new data, that it would tell me, that it matches the training data or it goes into the other group, which could be anything no need to know.p  pIs that something a SVM is able to do, or am I completly off I couldnt find any good examples of input data to see if my problem is something I could feed to SVM.p  pCurrently using Matlab.p

Negative 48572 pI am developing a client  server web service. The emfront endem is build with codehtmljavascriptjqueryjqmcode and the emback endem with codephpmysqlcode.p  pWhen the client starts it has a codestatic idcodenever changes and a codedynamictokencodethat means it may or may not change. For this reason every time the client starts we register him to our server we make a codePOSTcode request to our server where in the body we have a JSON file with the codeid and tokencode. The post request is made to a php script that looks like this  codemyserver.comregister.phpcode , The php script takes the codeid and tokencode and makes a query to the database to see if they exist. If the codeidcode doesnt exist it codecreatescode a new record. If it exists , it checks if the codetokencode has been changed so it codeupdatescode.p  pFrom the client the user can subscribe to a number of events lets say 10. The events are presented in a list with checkboxes. The user checks the events that he wishes to subscribe and presses a subscribe button. When the subscribe button is hit , a codePOSTcode request is made to a php script that in the body has a json file with the codeidcode of the user and all the names of the events with a boolean subscribe or not subsribe egp  precodeid xxxxxx event1 1 event2 0 event3 0 event4 1 ... codepre  pThe php script looks like this  codemyServersubscribe.phpcode. When the the request arrives the php file reads the JSON that was received. He searches for the codeidcode in the database and then he checks the names of the events and the booleans that were sent. If it is 1 he subscribes the user. If is 0 he unsubscribe the user. If the user was already subscribed and he subscribes again nothing happens. Same for the unsubscription.p  pFinally , when the user enters the subscription page , a codePOSTcode request is made to the server with a JSON file in the body that has the codeidcode of the user. The request is made on a php file that looks like codemyServerwhereSubsribed.phpcode. This php file , gets the codeidcode and looks in the database in which events this codeidcode is subscribed to. When it finishes it respondsmakes an echo to the client with a codejsoncode file that has all the events that the user is already subscribed , so that when the checkboxes are loaded , the events in which the user is already subscribed can seem checked.p  pIs the above service Rest  I have a really really hard time to understand what is Rest and what is not. What i understandp  pI know that i should use POST PUT DELELE GET but i can do everything with just POST as u saw. Then why use them I know that Rest is about nouns and not verbs , is about resources and not actions. I have NO idea what this means IN PRACTICE. p  pCan someone please , in this specific case that i describe ,  give a description of how a Rest web service would look like How is it possible that i dont have actions like subscribeunsubscriberegister p  pI hope that by giving me an example i can finally understand what is Rest. At this point maybe i should say that i dont know what is SOAP either. When i started developing my service i just made it like this because thats what i thought is the correct way. Then i learned about the RestSoap thing. So is Rest another way that my service could be done and if yes please take some time and explain me howp  pThank you very very much for reading this long post.p  pIf you are kind enough to give me an answer , please dont give me a definiton or a theorytical approach on the subject.

I have done a lot of manual testing in calculator with different values but I have yet to have it display this same behavior.p  pI was wondering if someone would take a look at see if I am missing something.p  precodefloat calcPopint popRand1, int popRand2, int popRand3, float pERand, float pSRand      return 23000  popRand1  popRand2  pERand  pSRand  popRand3  8  codepre  pThe variables are all contain randomly generated valuesp  ppopRand1 between 1 and 30p  ppopRand2 between 10 and 30p  ppopRand3 between 50 and 100p  ppSRand between 1 and 1000p  ppERand between 1.0f and 5500.0f which is then multiplied by 0.001f before being passed to the function abovep  pEditp  pAlright so after following the execution a bit more closely it is not the fault of this function directly.  It produces an infinitely positive float which then flips negative when I use this code later onp  ppPMax  intpPStorep  ppPStore is a float that holds popCalcs return.p  pSo the question now is, how do I stop the formula from doing this  Testing even with very high values in Calculator has never displayed this behavior.  Is there something in how the compiler processes the order of operations that is causing this or are my values simply just going too highp
Negative 48572 pIm working on two different LCD initializations. One is from the Professors hardware and the other one is mine. I want to switch between two functions using macro definitionsp  precodeifndef LCDProfessor  void InitLCD uint8t N, uint8t F, uint8t D, uint8t C, uint8t B, uint8t ID, uint8t SH   ...   endif  ifndef LCDGroup3  void InitLCD uint8t N, uint8t F, uint8t D, uint8t C, uint8t B, uint8t ID, uint8t SH   ...   endif codepre  pI was hoping that if I used define LCDGroup3 in the beginning of the file, I could choose between both functions. Truth is, I never really worked with these macros. Should this work or rather, is there any other way to do this p  pThanksp

Negative 48572 pI work on some hotel application. I have one ListView with some columns and one column is CheckBox column. When I click on that CheckBox the selected item is removed from ListView. Also when I click on that CheckBox i call a method from WCF service which doesnt work quite well. In database I have a table tblStay with a boolean column named IsFinished. I need that column to be set as True after CheckBox is clicked. Now this is strange after i put on breakpoint and checked if everything works well, it actually do works well. The field IsFinished has the value of True, but in my db it is still set as false. Then I restart the application and do the same thing again, and then it is saved as True in my db. Also this is not always the case. Sometimes its saved correctly but in most cases it does not work propertly.

Negative 48572 pI am developing a Javabased RESTful web application intended to be a centerpiece for its various client apps. Those clientapps can operate on the same assets in the main system e.g. clientapp A creates assets in main system, and clientapp B fetches them from the system. Weve rolled out the emv1em API version and develop new features in emv2em. The requirement is to release v2, while still supporting backwards compatibility for v1 for some period of time, until all clientapps are ported to v2. The idea behind this requirement is that clientapps potentially written against different API versions should still be able to cooperate on the same assets.p  pCurrently, we cover both API versions within a single instance of the system. While for some minor changes in HTTP API, it usually suffices to provide a new controller sth like a bridge pattern, for slightly bigger changes it seems best to write a new controller amp service layer and hopefully both versions will meet at some level, reusing a common set of functionalities.p  pHowever, there are much broader changes to come. Whats more, the main system is not just a dumb CRUD, its rather a complex multicomponent network, integrated with a handful of external services, involving some async jobs processing, etc. Certainly its all but a convenient place for keeping backward compatibility behaviorwise.p  pstrongAre there any best practises to keep backwards compatibility of API amp behavior behind it, while not turning the code into a messstrongp  pWe do care about the quality of code, and hate polluting it with copypasteadjust classes and maintaining duplicateparallel feature implementations. And yes, we have already divided the java packages for v1 and v2.p  pAlso, wed like to avoid the situation where the old versions code ties our hands and keeps us from redesigning the new versions architecture, just for the sake of simplicity of keeping this back compatibility.p

Negative 48572 pI am working on an app called TobaccoRoad that uses a library project called BestApproach. It uses a Parse backend to display custom generated content and handle push notifications. Everything was working pretty alright until a few days ago, when I must have messed up some settings somewhere and it no longer seems to be making the connection to the parse systems. Im quite sure its a local issue, because my second tester phone, which has not had updated code pushed to it in a few days, is still receiving notifications and can view that custom content.p  pThe weird thing is, even after clearing my workspace and starting fresh from the definitely good code my employer gave me, and following all the tutorials and troubleshooting guides on Parse.com see a hrefhttpsparse.comdocspushguideinstallationsAndroid relnofollowhttpsparse.comdocspushguideinstallationsAndroida a hrefhttpsparse.comtutorialsandroidpushnotifications relnofollowhttpsparse.comtutorialsandroidpushnotificationsa Im still not connecting to Parse. I havent made any significant changes that I can recall, so Im at a loss as to what might be causing this. p  pI know its not an issue of a bad applicationID or clientKey, because even substituting random strings into the Parse.initialize call gave the same results, and a logcat error about not being able to authenticate.p  pHere are the relevant bits from my manifest files, first for the library project...p  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt ltmanifest xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid       packagecom.bestapproach.lib       androidversionCode8       androidversionName1.6.1gt     ltusessdk androidminSdkVersion7 gt      ltusespermission androidnameandroid.permission.WRITEEXTERNALSTORAGEgtltusespermissiongt     ltusespermission androidnameandroid.permission.INTERNETgtltusespermissiongt     ltusespermission androidnameandroid.permission.ACCESSNETWORKSTATEgt     ltusespermission androidnameandroid.permission.CALLPHONEgtltusespermissiongt     ltusespermission androidnameandroid.permission.ACCESSFINELOCATIONgtltusespermissiongt     ltusespermission androidnameandroid.permission.VIBRATE gt     ltusespermission androidnameandroid.permission.RECEIVEBOOTCOMPLETED gt      ltapplication androidicondrawableappicon androidlabelstringappname         androidthemestyleTheme.BA gt         ltactivity androidnamecom.bestapproach.lib.SplashActivity                   androidlabelstringappname                   androidscreenOrientationportrait                   androidconfigChangesorientation                   androidthemestyleTheme.BA.Splashgt             ltintentfiltergt                 ltaction androidnameandroid.intent.action.MAIN gt                 ltcategory androidnameandroid.intent.category.LAUNCHER gt             ltintentfiltergt         ltactivitygt      ltDeclarations for all of my Activities...gt         ltservice androidnamecom.parse.PushService gt         ltreceiver androidnamecom.parse.ParseBroadcastReceivergt           ltintentfiltergt             ltaction androidnameandroid.intent.action.BOOTCOMPLETED gt             ltaction androidnameandroid.intent.action.USERPRESENT gt           ltintentfiltergt         ltreceivergt     ltapplicationgt             ltmanifestgt codepre  pAnd the manifest is exactly the same for my dependent project, with the exception of where I define a custom receiver at the endp  precodeltservice androidnamecom.parse.PushService gt ltreceiver androidnamecom.parse.ParseBroadcastReceivergt   ltintentfiltergt     ltaction androidnameandroid.intent.action.BOOTCOMPLETED gt     ltaction androidnameandroid.intent.action.USERPRESENT gt   ltintentfiltergt ltreceivergt ltreceiver androidnamecom.bestapproach.lib.MyCustomReceivergt     ltintentfiltergt       ltaction androidnamecom.bestapproach.lib.UPDATESTATUS gt     ltintentfiltergt ltreceivergt codepre  p p  pAnd heres the code for the onCreate method in my main activity SplashActivity where the Parse service is initializedp  precodeOverride protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState  super.onCreatesavedInstanceState setContentViewR.layout.activitysplash  String parseClientId  getStringR.string.parseclientid String parseAppId  getStringR.string.parseappid  debug output Log.vparse should be initializing..., parseAppId parseClientId  if .equalsparseClientId  .equalsparseAppId      Parse.initializethis, parseAppId, parseClientId     PushService.subscribethis, , MenuActivity.class     PushService.setDefaultPushCallbackthis, SplashActivity.class     ParseInstallation.getCurrentInstallation.saveInBackground     ParseAnalytics.trackAppOpenedgetIntent      final Activity a  this        Fetches content if it doesnt exist.

Here is example codep  precodesection .bss     PORT resw 1  section .data     port db 256,0x0  section .text     global start start     pusha     reset eax,ebx,edx to 0     xor eax, eax     xor ebx, ebx     xor edx, edx     .loop         compare portedx against 0x0 pointer arithmetic         cmp BYTE [port  edx], 0x0         je .exit         copy port[edx] to bl         mov bl, BYTE [port  edx]         substract 0 48 to get real integer         sub bl, 0         each cycle multiply by 10         imul eax, 10         add ebx not bl as eax is 32bit to eax         add eax, ebx         inc edx         jmp .loop     .exit         convert port value to bigendian value         shl eax, 8          mov [PORT], eax     popa     mov eax, 1     int 0x80 codepre  pAs I mentioned above, the value stored in [PORT] is truncated.  Now value in [PORT] is 0... Without applying shift instruction shl eax, 8, value will be 1.p  pI might miss something stupid or I lack knowledge. Please can someone explain what is wrong with this codep  pThanksp
Negative 48572 pI was wondering if anyone has implemented a PHP application level access to cPanel on a shared hosting provider  in my case  Siteground .

Negative 48572 pI have a site with a bunch of objects DIVs, and Im using Isotope and the codefitColumnscode mode to fit them on the page. Id like to have Isotope fit as many objects as it can in the height of the container as it always does, and then shrink the container height down to the bottom of the tallest column.p  pFor example if I have a bunch of objects that are each 400px tall and my container is set at 1000px tall, Isotope will only be able to put two objects in each column which is fine. But the container height will be set at 1000px, which leaves me with 200px of extra space at the bottom that I dont want. Instead, I want Isotope to shrink the container height down to 800px. It should do the best job it can fitting the objects in the columns, and then bring the overall container height up to hug the bottom of the objects. Make sensep  pI cant figure out a way to do this, since the codefitColumnscode layout method requires that I specify the height of the enclosing container thus setting a fixed height. How can I accomplish thisp

And as the file format will include a data table that can be big, I would need a method with a good compression rate.p  pCan you please help me to find the best solution for my needsp  pThanks in advancep

But i want it to sort on the latest date of the files in the directory like in the php file. so actualy i want to combine those to codes to one. so i have a php file called test. and i want the date of the latest file in the directory also called test. Those have always the same name.p  pWhat i thought was to use the output of the second code and then get rid of the sites and the .php. Those names must be in a array i think. and then for each name get the newestfile and sort them from newest to oldest.p  pi think like this i get the sites on which i was working recently at the top and the older ones at the bottom of the page. Maybe my aproach is totaly wrong but i have no idea how to do that in code. I hope you guys could help me with this.p

Negative 48572 pall. I had some questions about the Perl module HTTPCookies. The example on CPAN is like belowp  precodecookiejar  HTTPCookiesgtnew file gt ENVHOMElwpcookies.dat, autosave gt 1 codepre  pThe lwpcookies.dat file is used to save cookie data on my local machine as I understand. On my machine, ENVHOME is an empty path. The script runs good, even after execution I cant find any file named lwpcookies.dat on my machine. I changed ENVHOME to ENVTMP, which is a path really exists after I verified by Perl print. Still I cant find the lwpcookies.dat in my TEMP folder. My first question is how the HTTPCookies is working with the lwpcookies.dat file.p  pOn the other hand, on one of my systemsallre Windows system as mentioned here, the same code produce error message below  Cant open ENVHOMElwpcookies.dat No such file or directoryp  pSo its strange to me. On my good system, even file or path not exists, the script runs well, which I suppose the file is created on some temp memory instead on bad system, the code example doesnt work at all.p

The error I get is that this is not valid in the context... but why Why does one method signature compile but the other does not Can I achieve lambda format here I would really like to achieve the lambda format because I believe it is more readable even if it is a variable.

But I dont get the logic. strongFor one,strong I feel if they all failed or if they all succeeded, it made more sense to developers. strongTwo,strong even the successful casts look a little odd. I mean since a value type can be implicitly cast to its nullable equivalent and not the other way around, a cast to nullable should anyway succeed, but with the current implementation a nullable type is being successfully cast to nonnullable which can even fail if the former had a null value. Had this whole thing been other way around, it would have been easier comprehending.

I already implemented entropy technique on it which make it better but still am getting too much frames of same vehicle . I want to know the technique in which i can extract the only frame which contain the whole vehicle and ignore all other frames which contain that vehicle same vehiclep

Negative 48572 pIn many cases using one of the 4 UITableViewCell of the shelf styles is enough for what I need, except for one little annoying thing The cell.imageView.contentMode property is always set to Scale to Fill. If images have different ratios, it causes the cells labels to be pushed with different x per each Row. It looks ugly...p  pIf I try to fix it in code, lets say in the cellForRowAtIndexPath method, by addressing the property and assigning it to Aspect Fit, I get no warning or error, but it simply does nothing  i.e. it remains with Scale to Fill.p  pThat means, that if I have an app where Im not responsible for all the images presented in the table view and therefore cannot cut them in the same size  for example, if I wish to allow the user to select images from library or download etc...  I have to use a Custom Cell, even if all it has to have is an Image and a Label.p  pDoes anyone know how to solve this using the default styles, without subclassing UITableViewCellp

Negative 48572 pThis is an offshoot of my question found at a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions21080839pullingobjectsfrombinaryfileandputtinginlisttPulling objects from binary file and putting in ListltTgta and the question posed by David Torrey at a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16416423serializinganddeserializingmultipleobjectsSerializing and Deserializing Multiple Objectsa.p  pI dont know if this is even possible or not.  Say that I have an application that uses five different classes to contain the necessary information to do whatever it is that the application does.  The classes do not refer to each other and have various numbers of internal variables and the like.  I would want to save the collection of objects spawned from these classes into a single save file and then be able to read them back out.  Since the objects are created from different classes they cant go into a list to be sent to disc.  I originally thought that using something like sizeofthis to record the size of the object to record in a table that is saved at the beginning of a file and then have a common GetObjectType that returns an actionable value as the kind of object it is would have worked, but apparently sizeof doesnt work the way I thought it would and so now Im back at square 1.p

Only when I stress it for minutes on end from multiple threads, in tight loops.p  pI cannot have hidden bugs in my code, so I need more advice than to ask a specific question to get this running 100 errorfree, 247. Does the code above look fine for a lockfree threadsafe stack What else can I look at This is impossible to debug normally as the errors occur at various places, telling me there is a pointer or RAM corruption happening somewhere. I also get duplicate entries, meaning that a node that was popped of one stack, then later returned to that same stack, is still on top of the old stack... Impossible to happen according to my algorithm This lead me to believe its possible to violate DelphiWindows InterlockedCompareExchange Methods or there is some hidden knowledge I have yet to be revealed.  I also tried TInterlockedp  pI have made a complete test case that can be copied from ftp.true.co.za. In there I run 8 threads doing 400 000 pushpops each and it usually crashes safely due to checksraised exceptions after a few cycles of these tests, sometimes many many test cycles complete before one suddenly crash.p  pAny advice would be appreciated.p  pRegards Anton Ep

Negative 48572 pBelow, please find a screenshot that will provide some context for my question.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com4fLbG.png altenter image description herep  pThe above is a modified version of output from a reporting tool used by my company.  This report is spit out in Excel 2003 format and I will be manipulating it in Excel2010.  I cannot change the format of the output.  p  pMy issues with the above are twofold.  First, as far as I can tell, the app that generates the report uses nonbreaking spaces everywhere.  So simple MATCH statements on something like Not Blue will oftentimes return an NA because Im searching using a normal space between Not and Blue.  The other issue is that I cannot figure out how to do a SUMIFS using criteria from the first three columns to total all Data 1 values where I have Level 1BlueGreen as my criteria, for example.  The cells in columns 1 and 2 are coming over as merged cells and Id have to manually unmerge them and then copy down the appropriate cell value.  This would be painful.p  pI am hoping there is some way to get around these limitations so that I can write SUMIF formulas or INDEXMATCH or SUMPRODUCT or any other summingmatching formulas relatively easily against the format being spit out by the report, without having to majorly modify the output format.  My goal is to set up a standard calculations page which would do lookups against the report spit out by my companys application.  To simplify enduser interaction, I want to be able to have them just copypaste the output from the application into a sheet of my processing tool, which would then figure out the various totals I need.p  pI am perfectly willing to explore VBA as well as formulabased solutions.p
Negative 48572 pWhat is the best practice to keep database integrity while using laravels polymorphic relations p  pIm using Model Observers to updatedelete related models. So for example I delete related Documents on deleted event while deleting a Customer.  That means if an error occurs while deleting first document the rest will stay in the database... Or if I wrap documents deleting in a transaction all of them will stay in the database while parent object is deleted...p
Negative 48572 h2Backgroundh2  pI currently have a linear physics engine but this question does not require physics engine knowledge, parts of which Im experimenting with multithreading with the hope of increasing efficiency.p  pOne such section is the broad phase, in this case this involves moving through all the objects along all 3 axes to check which overlap any which occur on all axes are considered to have collided in broad phase. The 3 axis sweeps are, apart from using common objects, completely independent and so seemed a good place for multithreading.p  pIn order to avoid the possibility of blocking between threads each of these 3 processes takes a local copy of all data it wants to use before if applicable going multithreadedp  pWhile these sweeps are a significant bottle neck they are very short lived, a sweep typically lasts 14ms. This is a real time application where the code is run 60 times a second so total tick time is at maximum 17ms so 14ms is a long time for me. Because these sweeps are short lived I have used a thread pool. Specifically a codeExecutors.newFixedThreadPool3code, 3 for the 3 axes.p  pMy test computer was a dual core with hyper threading, so up to 4 threads should be comfortable. sub Checked using codeRuntime.getRuntime.availableProcessorscode subp  h2Questionh2  pWhen running the following test code, in which numerous short lived tasks were run either single threaded or multithreaded using a threadpool the multithreaded version was much slower see profile data. This was the case even when the multithreaded parts had no objects in common. Why was this and is there any way to run many short lived 14ms tasks concurrentlyp  pEven making the tasks much much larger only makes the multithreaded version approach the single threaded in performance not exceed it as I had expected, which makes me think im doing something seriously wrong. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comirUXp.png altenter image description herep  h2Test codeh2

Negative 48572 pI came accross a problem while using SockJS on a specific access network. It think it is related to the way SockJS chooses the best transport protocol websocket, long polling, ... according to the state of the network.p  pUsing a web browser, my SockJS client is connected with the websocket transport protocol to my node SockJS server. I even see the on connection event on node. However, when I send data, nothing passes through it. To be exhaustive, it works perfectly well from some other access networks.p  pAccording to the results of the website a hrefhttpwebsocketstest.com relnofollowhttpwebsocketstest.coma the state of this access network is a bit special for WebSockets Port 80, it is stucked top  precodeConnected       Yes Data Receive    Yes codepre  pTo be sure websocket works well, it should also have a Server time line updated every seconds by the test server. Since it is not the case, I am pretty sure I have a transparent HTTP proxy which breaks the websocket connection.p  pHowever, SockJS does not discover that, and it does not switch to a fallback protocol. I thought it was designed to do so.p  pAm I mistaken about the transport negotiation capabilities of SockJSp  pIs codeSocket.IOcode more robust in this kind of scenario or for this kind of access networks with transparent HTTP proxiesp  pI know I could use SockJS with SSL, but I think it is rather a fallback, not really a solution.p

Negative 48572 pI understand the basics concerns of shared state in a multithreaded environment  even when using MRI with the GILGVL.  But Im curious if there are different concerns when considering MRI  Puma vs jruby  Puma assuming Puma is configured to use multiple threads in both cases.p  pAlso, what are the critical sections involving shared state in the aforementioned cases and how would this differ in programs that arent fundamentally requestdriven like ones that would leverage a web server like Pumap  pThanks for your time and consideration any recommendations regarding good resources on these topics would also be much appreciated.p

Negative 48572 pSo I currently have a codeListViewcode that has many list items. Each list item for example has two views, codeView1code and codeView2code, inside of it and has a long press listener. By default, codeView2code is hidden until a long press is detected on the list item. The catch is that I would like only one list item to be showing both codeView1code and codeView2code at the same time. The rest of the list items should only be showing codeView1code. How would I implement thisp  pI was thinking of keeping track of the id of ListItem that should be showing both views in the codeListFragmentcode and inside the codegetViewcode method of the adapter, I would check whether the item Im loading should show codeView2code. Is this a good way to do it In addition, once the long press is detected, should I be grabbing all visible cells and update the visibility of codeView2code for each onep  pIs there a better solution to thisp

Negative 48572 pThere are many Android Permissions and generally each permission is mapped to a linux group id in AOSP and that is how the access control mechanism works. The mapping can be seen from the a hrefhttpsandroid.googlesource.complatformframeworksbasecd92588dataetcplatform.xml relnofollowplatform.xmla file. However all the permissions are not mapped to a group id, there are many permissions whose mapping is missing from platform.xml file. p  pLike FLASHLIGHT, SETORIENTATION, SETWALLPAPER, READSMS, SENDSMS and so on. Im curious to know how the systems works for these permissions. p  pThanks in advancep

And I got this issue  the id in the response doesnt match that was sent. E.g. request localhost8090test100 will get a 87 in the response.

Negative 48572 pCannot Close Workbook From User Form Hello everyone. This is my first post, and I could use a little help.p  pI have a workbook that contains sales data that I want to filter and then populate a form list that can be accesses from any sheet. I have created the form and the listbox, and it all works wellp  precodePrivate Sub UserFormInitialize Customer  SheetsReport.RangeA3 ActiveSheet.RangeA2AB2000.AutoFilter Field2, Criteria1Customer ActiveSheet.Cells.CurrentRegion.Copy Workbooks.Add RangeA1.PasteSpecial xlPasteAll ListBox.List  Workbooks2.SheetsSheet1.Cells.CurrentRegion.Value Workbooks2.Close False End Sub codepre  pThe variable Customer is loaded from the open workbook. The code filters all the sales for that customer, opens a new sheet, performs numerous formatting manipulations left out of the above code for brevity and then provides the source for the listbox on the user form. Works every time without any problems.p  pOn the form is ComboBox menu that contains all the customer names, the purpose of which is to reset the Customer variable and run the code again to generate a different report for a different customer. It is running the exact same code as above, and is initiated by clicking a button named Gop  precodePrivate Sub GoClick Customer  Dealers.Value ActiveSheet.RangeA2AB2000.AutoFilter Field2, Criteria1Town Appliance ActiveSheet.Cells.CurrentRegion.Copy Workbooks.Add RangeA1.PasteSpecial xlPasteAll ListBox.List  Workbooks2.SheetsSheet1.Cells.CurrentRegion.Value Workbooks2.Close False End Sub codepre  pThe problem is, that when this code runs, it generated a RunTime 1004 Error method close of object workbook failed. It refuses to close the temp workbook and forces a VB error every time. I have looked around to see what I could find online about this, but havent been able to make any sense of it. There was someone who wrote about putting the code in a separate module and only calling it from the form button, but that too has the same problem. What stumps me is that the process of running the code is identical to the one above it that works fine. The only difference is that the code in the first instance is run from a button in the main workbook, and the second code is run from the form itself. I cant see any way to get this to work, and obviously, unloading the form before closing the workbook wont work either.p  pThanks for any help on this.p

Negative 48572 pWhen I double click the card the dialog pops up, and it is then possible to create dynamic checkBoxes. So far so good.  When creating the checkBoxes it is possible to edit or delete the checkBoxes. The problem is that the delete image and edit paragraph dont get placed in a straight vertical line. Instead they get placed in a staggered  way by moving towards the left side.  You can see the problem in the image below.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com9qFKS.png altImagep  pHow to avoid this  p  pJQueryp  precodefunction addCheckboxname, status          status  status  false          var container  divboxs         var inputs  container.findinput         var id  inputs.length  1         var data               status status,             name name                   var div  ltdiv gt,  class allcheckbox          ltinput gt,              type checkbox,             id cb  id,             value name         .propchecked, status.onchange, function               data.status  this.propchecked             data.name  this.val         .appendTodiv  set checkbox status and monitor changes           ltlabel gt,              for cb  id,             text name         .appendTodiv          var trashImage  ltimg gt,              src httpwww.seniorclassaward.comsystemadminextensionsfieldtypesngenfilefieldimagestrashicon.gif,             class removeCheckBoxDialog,             for cb  id         .appendTodiv          var editCheckBox  ltp gt,              class editCheckBox,             text Edit         .appendTodiv          div.appendTocontainer          container.datacheckboxes.pushdata      codepre  pCSSp  precode.removeCheckBoxDialog, .editCheckBox      margintop3px     display inline     float right  .editCheckBox      cursor pointer     color GrayText     fontsize small     marginright8px  codepre  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.net62QY8134 relnofollowLive Demoap

Negative 48572 pI was just doing a small test to see how Javascript would respond to changing a child objects value within a parent object.

Negative 48572 pI have a package in SSIS and i need to retrieve some data from a web service. I can not use the web service task because the name of the service has spaces and then I dont know why its not possible with this kind of web services. So I went with the script component as source. My idea is to consume the web service from that script using c sharp. I add the web reference and the script compiles fine.  The problem is that after I close the script editor, the script component throws an error. When I try to execute the package shows as the image below. p  pimg srchttpi61.tinypic.com2u8uzpd.png alterror codep  pI am using Visual studio 2010.

Negative 48572 pI want to have the option to either write the results to a file or not, so I would have a file name fnm, and if its blank codecode I wont createwrite to the file. So basically I havep  precodeFILE f  iffnm open file for writing     f  fopenfnm.cstr, a   do some other stuff  forint idx0idxltnidx     printfdttdttdn, k, idx, A[idx]     iffNULL         fprintff,dttdttdn, k, idx, A[idx]        iffNULL     close the file     fclosef  codepre  pNow, codefcode doesnt actually get initialized to codeNULLcode upon declaring codeFILE fcode. It works fine if I initialize it manually codeFILE fNULLcode, so this is mostly me being curious as to the default initialization. I googled it before but the answers were for C and they said that it emisem initialized to codeNULLcode.p
Negative 48572 pI use a class called Year to return a very distant from now year. In case 1. I keep the class together with the main routine in the same file called YearAllTogether.cpp and in case 2. I place the class in a Year.cpp along with its corresponding header, Year.h. When I run the 1st case where everything is together YearAllTogether.cpp, I get a runtime of 7.4e05 sec whereas when I run the code where the class is in its own file and header, the runtime gets up to a huge 1.84526 sec. What is happeningwhat am I missing here To get some measurable runtime, I use a forloop to use the class 109 times. I post below the code for the two casesp  pCase 1.

Negative 48572 pGood Afternoon,p  pI have exhausted my googling and bestguess ideas, so I hope someone here has an idea of whether this is possible or not. p  pI am using Exchange Server 2010 vanilla in a test environment and trying to create a Hub Transport Rule using the Exchange Management Console. The requirements of the rules filtering are similar to the following scenariop  precode1. If a recipients address matches ends with testdomain.com AND begins with john  2. If the senders address matches ends with testdomain.com  3. Copy the message to the SupervisorOfJohnstestdomain.com mailbox codepre  pI have no problems doing items 2 and 3, but I cannot figure out how to get item 1 in the same condition. I have come across some threads that simply concluded that MS goofed on this, but I am hesitant to fault them for something which seems like it should be really straightforward. I must be missing something. Expressions I have tried so far...p  precode1. johntestdomain.com  2. johntestdomain.com  3. johntestdomain.com  4. john testdomain.com  5. johntestdomain.com codepre  pIf you use the interface and Add them as two separate entries, it treats them as an OR clause if a recipient address begins with john, OR it ends with testdomain.com. As you can see from my simplistic attempts, I have barely any clue what canshould work in this case. Any suggestions or ideas would be appreciated.p  pRespectfully,p  pB. Whitmanp

Otherwise, if . has already been   accumulated, the character is discarded and Stage 2 terminates. If it is not discarded, then a   check is made to determine if codeccode is allowed as the next character of an input field of the conversion specifier returned by Stage 1. If so, it is accumulated.p      pIf the character is either discarded or accumulated then in is advanced by in and processing   returns to the beginning of stage 2.p blockquote  pSo, Stage 2 can terminate if the character is in the list of allowed characters, but is not a valid character for codegcode.

Negative 48572 pThe question might sound a little bit odd.

Negative 48572 pIm wondering what the difference is between a normal variable and a collection. Heres an example for a normal variable.p  precodea  something b  a a  else p b  gt something codepre  pAs far as I know, codebcode holds a reference to the same object as codeacode, the string object codesomethingcode. Therefore its value changes when codeacode changes. Or to be more specific, when the referenced object changes. Why is this behavior different from the following array examplep  precodestring  hello array  [string] p array  gt [hello]  string  something else p array  gt [hello] codepre  pClose as I can figure the array doesnt hold the variable codeacode, but takes over the reference from codeacode and dumps the variable holding the reference codeacode. So when codeacode is changed, it has no impact on the array, as it has no underlying variable being changed.p  pIs this how this worksp  pstrongUpdatestrong To be more clear of what I meanp  precodea  hello array  [a] p a.objectid  2168500580 p array[0].objectid  2168500580 codepre  pOk, this means that the pointers codeacode and codearray[0]code point to the same object in memory. What I thought is that the pointer codearray[0]code IS the pointer codeacode, like literally the same, not a copy or something else. So when I change a, it gets changed everywhere. Like when I write codea.upcasecode. But when I just write codea.upcasecode, its like codeacode and codearray[0]code arent the same pointers anymore.p

Negative 48572 h2Backgroundh2  pI am working on a game analysis software where I have to convert sentences into what I call sentence templates and match those sentence templates with standard templates which are stored in an Excel sheet. Based on whether a match is found or not found there are some actions to be taken. The whole program is in an ExcelVBA.  p  pFor example, if the sentence isp  pPass thrown left flat T.Harry closest defenderp  pThe corresponding sentence template is p  pPass thrown DIR flat NAME closest defenderp  pThus the sentence template replaces variable words in a sentence with what I call Masks. Thus DIR could represent either of left, right or center and it will still represent the same sentence template. Similarly G.Jones could replace T.Harry and it would still be the same template. p  pOther than DIR and NAME there are about half a dozen different types of masks that are used. There are about 1200 standard templates.p  h2Problemh2  pThe masking is done through a program that cannot be 100  foolproof because the words masked, particularly the names, have many variations. For Example, T.Harry can be referred to simply as Harry or T. Harrywith space in between or Tom Harry. I need to have some way of determining that if all the other words in the sentence match the words of any of the 1200 templates except for the masks. If this LIKE match occurs, it is most likely the same sentence template and provided certain other filter conditions are met, it can be taken as the same sentence template with high degree of confidence.p  pThe Masks can appear at any position in the sentence and do not have any fixed places.p  pMy Approach which I think is inefficient and is brute forcep  pa Split each of the 1200 standard sentence templates into words using Split function p  pb Split the sentence to be compared also into words using Split functionp  pc Match the words in b with each of the 1200 templates in a loop by using following logicp  pd Keep matching words in the sentence template with the words from the standard sentence templates till one word does not match. If a word does not match, skip that and proceed to the next word. Keep matching till the non matching words exceed the number of masks. p  pe If non matching words exceed the number of masks it is most likely not same sentence.p  pf If non matching words are equal to or less than the number of masks and except for the masks, all other words match, then with a high degree of confidence it is the same sentence template.p  pIs there a better way to do this Are there ways we can find which is the first character where two strings do not match or show divergence. p  pHelp appreciated. As of now I have sought manual intervention when sentences do not match but if the above logic works, it would be great. Thanks in advance.p
Negative 48572 pId like to learn more about how the MySQL command line tool works.p  pSuppose I would like to be able to script multiple SQL statements and use shell scripting to output a description of the statements as they are processed.

Negative 48572 pIm looking for a way to protect some static content hosted on Apache.

But again, its not working.p  pThe solutions I want to avoid is to redirect to the static content and then expose the actual URL of the resource on Apache which can then be access without any authorization. I also dont want to use Tomcat to serve the static content with a servlet reading it blocks by blocks.p

E.g. lets say a user some time ago selected as sorting option Price from lowest to highest, meaning he will never get results sorted by relevance anymore until he will explicitly choose Relevance sorting option.p  pQuestion is  if it is still OK to test variations of the page in total as it is, or I need to setuplimit AB test only for the case where users have selected Relevance as a sorting option comparing in this way only user conversion via variations of this particular optionp  pThank you for any hints.p

Negative 48572 pThere are many questions of the converse, inserting a JTextPane into a JPanel. This is not my question. I need to be able to insert a custom JPanel with drag and drop, drag, and mouse click listeners into a JTextPane, which is then put into a JScrollPane, and finally put into a JFrame for displaying. The reason is because I need to have an image with support for resizing by dragging it within a chat client, which is itself primarily text. p  pConveniently enough, there is a relevant method in JTextPane insertComponentComponent c, but whenever I use it, my components end up being squished to exactly one line of text worth of space even though they report having a larger size. This is perfect for plain buttons, but if I need anything larger, Im out of luck. I can insert images by themselves just fine, with ImageIcons, but images wrapped inside a JPanel dont work at all plus I cant add any listeners to ImageIcons, since theyre not GUI elements overriding one isnt an option.p  pWhenever a user drags an image into the chat client, this bit of code inserts the custom JPanelp  precodeprivate void sendImageBufferedImage im, int cl throws IOException      ifoutput  null return      Send the image itself over to your friend     byte[] toSend  toBytesim, cl     sendStringnickname.hashCode  image Header for image     output.writeInttoSend.length Tells how many bytes to read.     output.writetoSend      Let the user know that the image was sent     float linmb  floattoSend.length  1048576.0 Size of file sent     addTextn  nickname   sent an image   linmb   MBn, Color.RED.darker      Show the image itself     DraggerPanel d  new DraggerPanelim, true     text.insertComponentd     d.repaint      Spacer     addTextn  codepre  pThis is the source for DraggerPanel, the custom JPanel that holds an imagep  precodepublic class DraggerPanel extends JPanel  private BufferedImage image The image were drawing private Point startingPoint  null Starting point for resizing private boolean first  true Is this the first drag private boolean lockedDrag If true, then lock x and y to be proportionally dragged.  public DraggerPanelBufferedImage image, boolean lockedDrag      super     this.image  image     this.lockedDrag  lockedDrag      The listener for dragging events.     addMouseMotionListenernew MouseMotionListener              private int inWidth  0, inHeight  0 Initial height and width values             private double ratio  0 Ratio of height to width for locked drag.              public void mouseDraggedMouseEvent m                  if first  If were first, record initial position.                     startingPoint  m.getPoint                     first  false                     inWidth  getWidth                     inHeight  getHeight                     ratio  doubleinHeight  inWidth                  else  Otherwise, change the size of the window.                     if lockedDrag                          int w  intstartingPoint.getX  m.getX                         int h  intstartingPoint.getY  m.getY                         setSizeMath.absinWidth  w, Math.absinHeight  h                      else                          int w  intstartingPoint.getX  m.getX                         int h  intdoubleratio  w                         setSizeMath.absinWidth  w, Math.absinHeight  h                                                       repaint                           public void mouseMovedMouseEvent m                            Lets us know when youre not dragging anymore.     addMouseListenernew MouseAdapterpublic void mouseReleasedMouseEvent mfirst  true      Set appropriate size.     ifimage  null setSizeimage.getWidth, image.getHeight     else setSize200,200      Were live, baby.     setVisibletrue   public void paintGraphics g      if image  null super.paintg     else g.drawImageimage, 0, 0, getWidth, getHeight, null   codepre  pUpdate 1 I followed camickr s advice, and updated the DraggerPanel to use setPreferredSize instead of setSize, as well as overrode paintComponent instead of paint. Now, the image has the proper height, but is stretched to the width of the JTextPane which seems like what it was doing before. Furthermore, resizing doesnt seem to matter the image doesnt change its size at all. Mouse events are definitely going through, but not affecting the size. It seems as though the original problem isnt fully resolved, since the JPanels size isnt what I need it to be, and the solution to that will also lead to a solution to the resizing issue.p  pUpdate 2 I did it I finally did it. To the future time travelers who have this issue, I basically yelled at the JTextPane by not only using setSize in my overridden JPanel, but also setPreferredSize and setMaximumSize. The preferred one works well with height, and the maximum sets the width God knows why. Thanks for your tips, camickrp

Negative 48572 pHi I have a method in which I use the Promise class provided by bluebird to either resolve or reject based on the result of a third party function. My concern is that the third party function is synchronous and hence could throw an error. Below is my codep  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodejs langjs prettyprintoverridecodeAuthenticator.prototype.createJWTResponse  functionuser, secret    if user ampamp user.ID      var expires  moment.add7, days.valueOf     encode is third party and synchronous that can throw error     var token  jwt.encode       iss user.ID,       exp expires     , secret      throw new Errorthrown by a promise method      return Promise.resolve       token token,       expires expires,       user           else      return Promise.rejectnew ErrorAuthenticatorcreateJWTResponse user object missing or doesnt have ID    codepre div div p  pOne option is that I do not use reject and response in the method and make it a normal callback method which is then promisified by Promise.promisify. However my question is if there is a way to use resolve and reject and create a promise in case the third party method throws an exception. Another question that I have is it is not stated in bluebird documentation that if one is using resolve and reject in a method can such a method be promisified I tried to promisify the above method but it fails to return for some reason amp doesnt throw an error which makes me suspect that if one is using resolve, reject in a method then such a method cannot be promisifed.p  pCan someone clarify this for me Thanks in advance.p  pUpdatep  pIf I wrap the method in Promise.method bluebird throws a very clear error as followsp  pPossibly unhandled Error Synchronous Error in otherwise promise returning methodp  pReturning a Promise.try from inside this method also throws the same error as in case of Promise.method.p  pWrapping the code in the method in a try catch and rejecting on error also throwsp  pPossibly unhandled Errorp  pSolutionp  pAs suggested by Benjamin taking away all resolve and reject calls from within the method and wrapping it in Promise.method gives the expected result.

The WHERE clause will put a AND operator between all NON NULL fields and compare with the passed parameters. As per the given table data, the nonnull field in first row is Field1. So the WHERE clause will be p  precodeField1  Parameter1 codepre  pAs per the given table data, the nonnull fields in the second row is Field1 and Field2.

I was struggling with making it feel clean and it was generally pretty buggy. p  pAfter investigating solutions Ive rebuilt most of my methods using Gson. Im dealing with a lot of nested objects with more nested arrays and further nested objects. p  pIve got a top level container class which looks likep  precodepublic class MovieContainer implements Serializable   private ListltMoviegt movies  public ListltMoviegt getMovies      return movies      codepre  pThe movie class containsp  precodepublic class Movie implements Serializable      private static final long serialVersionUID  1L      SerializedNamerating     private Rating ratings      SerializedNametmdbid     private int tmdbID      SerializedNameactorroles     private Actor actors       ...20 or so items and getterssetters removed for brevity codepre  pIve then got another class to deal with the Actors, which might have its own class for its own objects, likewise for the Ratings class and so on.p  pTo parse my JSON Ive currently got 12 different classes. p  pWhen I need to access something from a nested object my java ends up looking likep  precodemovieItem.getImages.getBackdrop.getURL codepre  pWhich doesnt really feel very clean for a start. p  pIve used a few custom Deserializer methods to deal with dynamic objects and I feel like Ive just replicated my messy bloated code to solve this issue in the first place. I have added a large number of classes and complexity and Im struggling to see what I gained from it. p  pAm I just using GSON completely wrong have I missed the point all together Is there some standardized patterns I should be using but just cant find examples of p  pAny direction on how I should correctly be dealing with this would be much appreciated. p  pA snippit of input might look like a hrefhttpsgist.github.comanonymous5c5413c80bcbe7c3d25a relnofollowhttpsgist.github.comanonymous5c5413c80bcbe7c3d25aa Its pretty long so wont post it herep

Negative 48572 pI have a Django application using a database with approximately 1.8 million rows in the primary table. This table is readonly in the application.p  pOnce per day I need to perform updateorcreate on the entire database to refresh the data with an updated file from an external source. I imagine the fastest way to do this would be to load the table into a RAMbased table, perform all the updates, and then flush it back to the SQLite3 file. Alternately, I could create a new table, bulkload everything, and then swap the new table into place of the original table. Either approach works conceptually.p  pWhat I am wondering is how do I go about doing either of these Which is preferred from a performance perspective Which will have the least disk IOp  pAny suggestions or links on either approach are appreciated.p

Is there any way I can make it return only 1 most recent, or like 100 posts.  What is the minimum and maximum amount I can return.  And what is the syntax for it.  This is the default request I havep  precodehttpthisismywebsitewherewordpresslives.comwpjsonpostsfiter[categoryname]Some Category Name I want to queryampfilter[order]ASC codepre

Negative 48572 pOur employees are doing work for clients, and the clients send us files which contain information that we turn into performance metrics we do not have direct access to this information  it needs to be sent from the clients. These files are normally .csv or .xlsx so typically I read them with pandas and output a much cleaner, smaller file. p  p1 Some files contain call drivers or other categorical information which repeats constantly for example, Issue Driver 1 with like 20 possibilities and Issue Driver 2 with 100 possibilities  these files are about 100 million records per year so they become pretty large if I consolidate them. Is it better to create a dictionary and map each driver out to an integer I read a bit about the category dtype in pandas  does this make output file sizes smaller too or just inmemoryp  p2 I store the output as .csv which means that I lose the dtypes if I ever read the file again. How do I maintain dtypes and should I save the files to sqlite instead perhaps instead of massive .csv files My issue now is that I literally create codes to break the files up into separate .csvs per month and then maintain a massive file which I use for analysis dump it into Tableau normally. If I need to to make changes to the monthly files I have to rewrite them all which is slow on my laptops nonSSD hard drive.p  p3 I normally only need to share data with one or two people. And most analysis requests are adhoc but involve like one  three years worth of very granular data individual surveys or interactions each represented by a single row in separate files. In other words I do not need a system with high concurrency of readwrite. Just want something fast, efficient, and consolidated. p

In my proof of concept I am trying to breakup an AngularJS 1.3 App into 2 modules bob and joe. Each module should share a Provider that should have a configurable variable called food. I am trying to define a reusable service and create a separate instance for each module.p  pI have read the Angular documentation about Providers, and from what I understand providers allow you to extract the configurable part into the .config. What am I doing wrong I would expect Bobs Food to be Banana, but Joes Food which is configured second is overwriting Bobs Food. This leads me to believe the Food provider is not creating a new instance for each of the bob and joe modules.p  pIm on AngularJS v1.3.15p  pindex.htmlp  precodeltdiv ngcontrollerBobCtrlgtBobs Food  providerInstance.get ltdivgt ltdiv ngcontrollerJoeCtrlgtJoes Food  providerInstance.get ltdivgt codepre  papp.jsp  precodeangular.moduleshared.providerFood, function    var food  Default     this.set  functionfood  food  food     this.get  function      return        get function           return food                  angular.modulebob.configfunctionFoodProvider     FoodProvider.setBanana  angular.modulebob.controllerBobCtrl, functionscope, Food    scope.providerInstance  Food   angular.modulejoe.configfunctionFoodProvider    FoodProvider.setApple  angular.modulejoe.controllerJoeCtrl, functionscope, Food    scope.providerInstance  Food  codepre

Negative 48572 pThis question is particular to the FastSerialization library. a hrefhttpsgithub.comRuedigerMoellerfastserialization relnofollowhttpsgithub.comRuedigerMoellerfastserializationap  pI am using FSTLongOffheapMap version 2.29 on windows 7, jdk 1.7 to store some objects. I tested the latency of storing an object and the 99.99 percentile comes to about 100 micros. This is strongexcellentstrong considering I ran it on windows  didnt write a custom serializer  didnt tune the GC too much.p  pHowever, the performance drops sharply if I change the setup as followsp  pa Create a producer thread and a consumer thread piped by an ArrayBlockingQueue.p  pb Let the producer produce 50,000 objects and stuff them in the queue as quickly as possible.p  pc The consumer thread pulls out the object, dispatch it to a listener and then store it in the offheapmap.p  pIn this setup, the 99.99th percentile latency comes to strong135 millisstrong But the biggest surprise is that if I just comment out the line which performs the put, the latency drops to 400 micros. This seems illogical to me as I know from the previous test that the latency of a put in the map is only 100 micros.p  pBelow is a test to reproduce my finding, I will appreciate any suggestionshintsideas.

Negative 48572 pMy app at googleappengine uses a yaml settings file. Ive used the same approach in several similar app engine apps for a couple of years. App settings that do not have to change unless at deployment time go into that yaml file.p  pNow opening and loading from that yaml file turned out to be a big source of problem if I had a bunch of users going at the API at the same time. So I quickly fixed the issue some year or two ago by memcaching the contents of the yaml. That worked well for a long time.p  pI realized recently that I still get occasional DeadlineExceededErrors errors when trying to open that file. The number of open attempts should be very few when I manually change the key used for the memcache really, which should be even less than amount of deployments. What really happens, sometimes, is that it times out after 60 seconds, failing to open that file  this happens when the memcache for some reason has lost the content pertaining to that key. Thats okay because thats how Memcache works, it still keep the memcached stuff around most of the time. I just use it for that yaml file and never felt a need to use it for anything else. Still, the open often fails out after 60 seconds, with a DeadlineExceededErrors. p  pAny leadsp  pThe error log goes like thisp  precodeFile basedatahomeappssmjpuroland1.385586677613659867mjconfig.py, line 81, in loadversionsettings     versionsettings  yaml.loadopenversionsettingsfile.read   File basedatahomeruntimespython27python27libversionsthirdpartyyaml3.10yamlinit.py, line 71, in load     return loader.getsingledata   File basedatahomeruntimespython27python27libversionsthirdpartyyaml3.10yamlconstructor.py, line 37, in getsingledata     node  self.getsinglenode   File basedatahomeruntimespython27python27libversionsthirdpartyyaml3.10yamlcomposer.py, line 36, in getsinglenode     document  self.composedocument   File basedatahomeruntimespython27python27libversionsthirdpartyyaml3.10yamlcomposer.py, line 55, in composedocument     node  self.composenodeNone, None   File basedatahomeruntimespython27python27libversionsthirdpartyyaml3.10yamlcomposer.py, line 84, in composenode     node  self.composemappingnodeanchor   File basedatahomeruntimespython27python27libversionsthirdpartyyaml3.10yamlcomposer.py, line 133, in composemappingnode     itemvalue  self.composenodenode, itemkey   File basedatahomeruntimespython27python27libversionsthirdpartyyaml3.10yamlcomposer.py, line 84, in composenode     node  self.composemappingnodeanchor   File basedatahomeruntimespython27python27libversionsthirdpartyyaml3.10yamlcomposer.py, line 133, in composemappingnode     itemvalue  self.composenodenode, itemkey   File basedatahomeruntimespython27python27libversionsthirdpartyyaml3.10yamlcomposer.py, line 82, in composenode     node  self.composesequencenodeanchor   File basedatahomeruntimespython27python27libversionsthirdpartyyaml3.10yamlcomposer.py, line 111, in composesequencenode     node.value.appendself.composenodenode, index   File basedatahomeruntimespython27python27libversionsthirdpartyyaml3.10yamlcomposer.py, line 84, in composenode     node  self.composemappingnodeanchor   File basedatahomeruntimespython27python27libversionsthirdpartyyaml3.10yamlcomposer.py, line 127, in composemappingnode     while not self.checkeventMappingEndEvent   File basedatahomeruntimespython27python27libversionsthirdpartyyaml3.10yamlparser.py, line 98, in checkevent     self.currentevent  self.state   File basedatahomeruntimespython27python27libversionsthirdpartyyaml3.10yamlparser.py, line 428, in parseblockmappingkey     if self.checktokenKeyToken   File basedatahomeruntimespython27python27libversionsthirdpartyyaml3.10yamlscanner.py, line 116, in checktoken     self.fetchmoretokens   File basedatahomeruntimespython27python27libversionsthirdpartyyaml3.10yamlscanner.py, line 159, in fetchmoretokens     self.stalepossiblesimplekeys   File basedatahomeruntimespython27python27libversionsthirdpartyyaml3.10yamlscanner.py, line 283, in stalepossiblesimplekeys     for level in self.possiblesimplekeys.keys DeadlineExceededError codepre  pUpdate Looking at the log again, I realized that what is timing out is the emyaml.loadem part, emnotem open.

Negative 48572 pThis topic has been discussed before, however I was unable to find anything applicable.p  pI have a large number of datasets numbering in the thousands, which Id like to display and then run through a JS pagination.p  pThat obviously requires me to fetch all the results, which just takes a few milliseconds and is barely noticeable.p  pHowever upon constructing the actual page, the images, which are largely recurring, lead to a page loading time of 10 seconds, which is decidedly too long.p  pMy question is fairly simple Is there some way to tell the browser to download each picture just once and reuse that instead of apparently downloading the same pictures over and over againp  pOr do you know any other tricks to speed up page loading for many datasets with recurring picturesp  pId like to avoid having to do the pagination via AJAX if possible.p  pMy table structure looks like thisp  precodelttablegt     lttrgt         lttdgtNumberlttdgt         lttdgtImagelttdgt         lttdgtImagelttdgt         lttdgtTextlttdgt         lttdgtTextlttdgt         lttdgtTextlttdgt         lttdgtTextlttdgt         lttdgtImagelttdgt         lttdgtTextlttdgt         lttdgtImagelttdgt         lttdgtImagelttdgt     lttrgt lttablegt codepre  pThe last image is the same for all rows, for images one and two its always one of two different images, four is one of 13 different images.p  pI hope you can help me out a little.p  pEdit Thanks to the previous replies, I managed to get rid of the image loading times, which is per definition great, however it didnt really reduce my loading times all that much.p  pFirebug tells me, that it wastes most of the time on codeWaitingcode, which gives me an entirely new angle on the problem I can explore.p  pThanks for helping out so far, if I get stuck again, Ill open a new question. p  pOn a final note, it appears the problem wasnt the serverclient transfer connection, but much rather my Firefox is having issues rendering the large block.

Negative 48572 pI have an Android application with a map at the moment.p  pThe native Google Maps application has a button that appears in street view, and when double tapped, it converts street view to VR mode. More specifically, it splits the street view in two for a separate image for each eye, to be used with Google cardboard. It then also tracks device movements and adjusts the FOV accordingly.p  pIm building my own app, and would like to use this VR feature of maps in my own application. p  pOne thought I have is to load two street view images immediately adjacent to each other, and then update the FOV by reading the device sensors.p  pI can see this being slow as my implementation is not likely to be as snappy as Googles.p  pIs there a way to use Googles own VR mode in a native appp  pIf not, what would you suggest doing to achieve the same effectp

I figured out why and changed FFA.csv  to FFA.xlsx  and it worked error free. Then I started doing other things and debugging. Got up this morning and now  i get the following Error  line contains NULL byte. weird because the code started out good. Now  it cant read.

Ive made sure to profile and catch memory leaks ie. missing CGContextRelease as well as using codeautoreleasepoolcode etcp  pDuring unzipping, in xcode I see the memory usage shooting up fast, neverending until the unzipping finishes, and I cannot explain this because there are no objects in Instruments that I can see being held onto.

If I use Instruments allocation tool, I see 50.2MB of heap and anonymous VM used. Thats a huge differencep  pThe first thing I did was assume that code[UIImage imageNamedcodewas to blame caching etc because I have quite a few animated UIImageViews, so I spent time removing all imageNamed from my code, and using codeimageWithContentsOfFilecode instead.
