Positive 4088 pI have a question about the number of cycles needed for bitwise operation, or more precisely, the XOR operation. In my program, I have two 1D arrays of uint8t variable with a fixed size of 8. I want to XOR both arrays and I was wondering what was the most effective way to do so. This is a code summarizing the options I have found p  precodeint main      uint8t tab[4]  1,0,0,2     uint8t tab2[4]  2,3,4,1       First option       uint8t tab3[4]  tab[0]tab2[0], tab[1]tab2[1], tab[2]tab2[2], tab[3]tab2[3]       Second option       uint32t t  tab      uint32t t2  tab2      uint32t t3  t  t2     uint8t tab4  ampt3       Comparison        printfd amp dn, tab3[0], tab4[0]     printfd amp dn, tab3[1], tab4[1]     printfd amp dn, tab3[2], tab4[2]     printfd amp dn, tab3[3], tab4[3]      return 0  codepre  pWhat is the best option from a cyclebyte point of viewp
Positive 4088 pMy professor assigned this task for the next week. You have to create variables and within one expression make an algorithm that gives 1 true when the given x, y, z are calculated and in each other state of x, y, z the result is 0.

For example, if my bitstring is 14 bits, then 2 bytes 16 bits are needed to store the bitstring, with byte zero being most significant and byte 1 being least. We lose bits 0 and 1 the two least significant bits from the least significant byte, namely byte 1.

Positive 4088 pI am writing a simple BigInteger type in Delphi. This type consist of an array of unsigned 32 bit integers I call them limbs, a count or size and a sign bit. The value in the array is interpreted as absolute value, so this is a signmagnitude representation. This has several advantages, but one disadvantage.p  pThe bitwise operations like codeandcode, codeorcode, codexorcode and codenotcode have twos complement semantics. This is no problem if both codeBigIntegercodes have positive values, but the magnitudes of negative codeBigIntegercodes must be converted to twos complement by negation. This can be a performance problem, since if we do, sayp  precodeC  A and B codepre  pthen I must negate the magnitudes of codeAcode and codeBcode before the codeandcode operation can be performed. Since the result is supposed to be negative too, I must negate the result too to get a positive magnitude again. For large codeBigIntegercodes, negating up to three values can be a considerable performance cost.p  pMind you, I know how to do this and the results are correct, but I want to avoid the slowness caused by the necessary negations of large arrays.p  pI know of a few shortcuts, for instancep  precodeC  not A codepre  pcan be achieved by calculatingp  precodeC  1  A codepre  pwhich is what I do, and the result is fine. This makes codenotcode as performant as addition or subtraction, since it avoids the negation before and after the operation. p  h2Questionh2  pMy question is are there similar laws I can use to avoid negating the magnitudes of negative codeBigIntegercodes I mean something like the calculation of codenotcode by using subtractionp  pI mean simple or notsosimple laws likep  precodenot A and not B  not A or B   is Pascal for  not A or not B  not A and B codepre  pbut then for A andor B, etc. I do know thatp  precodeA and B ltgt A or B  ltgt is Pascal for  codepre  pstrongemis not trueemstrong, but perhaps there is something similarp  pstrongI simply cant find any such laws that relate to emnegativeem values and bitwise operations, if they exist at all.

Negative 4088 pI am currently writing a simple, timer based mini app in C that performs an action n times every k seconds.br I am trying to adopt a test driven development style, so my goal is to unit test all parts of the app.p  pSo, my question is Is there a good way to unit test a timer based classp  pThe problem, as I see it, is that there is a big risk that the tests will take uncomfortably long to execute, since they must wait so and so long for the desired actions to happen.br Especially if one wants realistic data seconds, instead of using the minimal time resolution allowed by the framework 1 ms.br I am using a mock object for the action, to register the number of times the action was called, and so that the action takes practically no time.p
Negative 4088 pI have been used to working with VS2005 and 2008  using msbuild, etc, but I have inherited a set of projects that have to remain in vc6.0 for now.

Is this possiblep  pI have tried the nmake utility, but I still need to open up the projects and saveexport the make file.  This is tedious if the project changes  each time I have to save the make file.  nmake seems to work, but it had a problem when I changed the location of the project in my directory tree I checked out of svn into a new clean dir to try the build.

Negative 4088 pIm using php for my site and was wondeirng if it would be a good idea to use the SERVER md5SERVER[remoteaddr]  SERVER[httpuseragent] into a cookieauth field in the user table. p  pWhen the user logs in, php will use the above key to recheck the current user and compare it to the stored key  and if matched get credintials for the user. p  pThe problems are, the user agent can change and IP can change. I guess my main concern is the user user agent.   IP addresses typically stay around for a month or two and my primary user base has static ip addresses companies so this shouldnt be issue. p  pAre there any other php SERVER variablies that I could concatinate that would be less volitile... but still dynamic p  pI have the php manual infront of me but I dont see any usefull...

Negative 4088 pWe are using Oracle Weblogic 10.3 as our application server.  We have multiple modules that need to access an Object contains some HashMaps that is common for the managed server.  This object will be populated via some other process on a daily basis.  We do not want to have copies of this in each application, due to the large number of applications and limited memory.  We cannot combine these into one ear since the individual wars would need to be updated on differing schedules.p  pI have tried creating an optional package and referencing it in two modules.  The class being access just wraps calls to a singleton of the object.  But what happens a separate singleton is created for each application, defeating the purpose.p  pIt appears startup classes were deprecated sometime around or after 8.1, and now gone in 10.3.p  pIs there any way to have this object and other code live above the applicationmodule level, have only one copy per jvm  managed server, and be accessible by all modules deployed to the same managed serverp  pBonus points if the solution would also work in Tomcat.p
Negative 4088 pI have a jar file say app.jar in a certain location available as a filestream from an http server.  The problem is that app.jar is itself a frequently updated jar file being updated regularly at the server. I have another jar file say load.jar which is simply downloadable by any user. At runtime, the user runs the load.jar, which is required to load the app.jar in a separate process keeping the app.jar in memory no cacheing to disk, then execute the app.jar and terminate itself load.jar. Is it possible to be done  Any help is highly appreciated. Thanks in advance. Regards, KTp  pUpdate.p  pHi,p  pThanks all for the reply.  However, I guess I have not given a complete picture. An image strongema hrefhttpwww.freeimagehosting.netimage.php1ec6fd4363.jpg relnofollowlink textaemstrong is attached depicting the scenario. 4 jars the actual common executors are hosted on a central server.  These are updated frequently probably 34 times a day initially down to once a day eventually. A local server at one of the member is hosted which is initialised. The launcher on the local server downloads all the 4 binaries and keeps it in memory  no cacheing to disk.  These jar files are selfsufficient and are not dependent on any library on the Local Server  they in fact invoke jars from the Local Server. The client jar eventually is hosted with the Local Server and forwarded to its clients on demand via webapp by the Local Server. Also, the Launcher needs to exit by invoking the downloaded Main jar from the server in a separate JVM.p  pRegards, KTp

Negative 4088 pI have a project that shows a UI when no proper command line arguments are passed. Its is a simple utility built to dynamically update a desktop wallpaper. When its done with its update I call p  precodethis.Dispose codepre  pbut this causes an issue if command line arguments are passed. The form actually ends up getting the Dispose method call before it has been shown to the user. The result is a nasty error saying that the program failed to run properly even though it did just as I wanted.p  pI can respect the that that Im not being very logical about this but I havent a clue another way to look at a solution. Is there another way to call the Dispose method cleanly before an application has loaded without causing an errorp  pstrongAdditional Infostrongp  pThe above is evidentially not clear and I apologize for that. My program is started from a Program.cs filep  precodeApplication.Runnew MainForm codepre  pIn the constructor I check if command line arguments exists and if so call a routine called SilentRun. This private method checks if the arguments are valid and if so passes them to a method to commit actions called BrandSystem.p  pAfter BrandSystem is complete, with its work, the last statement isp  precodethis.Dispose codepre  pas there is nothing else for the application to actually do. This same method is called if no command arguments are passed and the user uses the GUI to apply the changes. Essentially once the process of updating the wallpaper is complete I want the application to terminate itself.p  pThe reason for the command line arguments are so this utility of sorts can be added to an installation package and run silently in the background. My installation process does not have the native ability to update a wallpaper and this is a twobirdonestone utility for me.p  pThe issue comes when the program runs in command line mode and calls Dispose before everything is actually loaded. Im open to suggestions even if they prove my logic completely unsound.p

Negative 4088 pJust started using GIMP today. When I resize the canvas manually in GIMP so that its smaller than the image size it lets me move the image around so that I can change the viewable area. How do I replicate this in a script In other words, I want the script to pause at the canvas resizing step and let me position the image correctly.p  pThe reason Im asking Ive written a small script that will create square thumbnails of images. The way Im doing this is by resizing the canvas so that the height and width are the same. If the height and width are different I change the higher of the two so that it is the same as the lower e.g. 600x500 becomes 500x500. I then flatten the image and scale it to whatever I need.p  precodeif gt width height     begin         gimpimageresize image height height 0 0          begin         gimpimageresize image width width 0 0       codepre  pThe code Im using to resize the canvas is above.  I know the last two values in the gimpimageresize command refer to the offsets. This is what I want to manually modify when the script reaches this step. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

After searching here in Stack Overflow and another site I found that I can respectively use Regexs codepPcode for punctuation and codepZcode for whitespace, and it works when reading from a text file. The question is that in the final program it will be needed to read records from an SQL database and process them using this lexical analiser, and I dont know what is the encoding of the records in the DB. Can this be a problem in this situation Can the mentioned Regexes match every punctuation and whitespace character of an input no matter what their encoding isp  pThank you very much.p

Negative 4088 pI delved into MySQLi last night only used normal mysql before that to call MySQL stored procedures as part of a calendar script on my site. The SP that loads calendar events and hyperlinks the days works perfectly each time by using mysqliquerycall SP. This SP takes no parameters and returns a set of rows.br I want to add, in the same script, the option to click on one of the days and show details of the event that day. As this is the same script, I want to use the same MySQLi connection, but each time I try, the return value of the query is a Booleanfalse. The second SP takes the date as a parameter, and Ive constructed it before the query call. Printing it to the web page, and running it from the MySQL CLI yields the expected data, so the SP works, and the user is authorised to execute SPs.br Out of interest, I tried replacing the SP call with the SP contents in query, and again received a false return, so it seems to me that MySQLi is not allowing me to perform two queries on the same connection. Ive done some tinkering and tried free on the first result set, to no avail. As I expected, if I closed and reopened the MySQLi connection, I could call the SP, but this seems to be very inefficient. Is there a specific sequence to perform multiple MySQL calls not simultaneously on the same connection Ive searched but only vaguely, as I dont really know what to search for. Thanks.p

Heres what Id like p  ol liUser clicks a link on my Drupal website, a video box player pops up as a minibox player for the user to watch in a PC or Mac.li liFor iphone users, want the ability for them to view video on iPhone which means it cant be flash.li ol  pHeres where I am so far. I recorded a screencast using both Camtasia for Mac and Screenflow. But I dont know which format to encode the video or how to.p  pIve read that JW player long tail video is a good player because it will play both flash and HTML good for iPhone, but then also read that Drupal and JWplayer does do a popup video window from a link. Is that truep  pSo before embarking further, Id love some input on how to proceed Which encoding format, how to achieve popup video player, and have ability to play on iPhone. Of course all through a Drupal site. Btw I would be hosting the video on Vimeo, or Amazons cloudfront.p  pThanksp

Negative 4088 pHey there, lets assume I have a code which lets the user pass the codethreadsperblockcode to call the kernel. than I want to check, if the input is valid e.g. lt512 for compute capability CC lt2.0 and 1024 for CC 2.0. now I wonder what happens when I compile the code with codenvcc archsm13code while having a graphics card in my computer with CC2.0 what happens when a user passes threadsperblock 1024 Is this a valid input since the card I run has CC2.0 or is this input invalid since I compiled it for CC1.3 or does the codenvcc archsm13code just mean that CC1.3 is at least necessary but when running it on higher CC, those higher features can although be used thanksp

Negative 4088 pThis has me stumped. But Im new at this. The generic view objectdetail is called with a queryset and the id field of interest. When objectdetail then renders the template it is done with the templateobjectname. When I write the template I use the templateobjectname and can display all the fields. OK, thats nice, but I have a form I made with ModelForm.p  pSo how do I get the form to show up Ive looked around for this. I tried passing the form in extracontext so that the form could accept the data in the object that is used to render the template, but no go.p  pThe workaround is just writing a view. The problem with objectdetail is that the SQL that pull out the row by specified id is done inside objectdetail and then the object goes to the view. If Im interested in using the form that I created with ModelForm then I want to set a formmymodelFormobject and pass form to the template for rendering. Another way to ask my question is where is the hook in objectdetail that specifies what kind of object is specifiedp

Negative 4088 pIm developing a web application that has a certain layout.br Im mainly using CSS for styling the buttons and using divs and styling them for other layout items.br The problem is that sometimes I need a layout item to be nonrectangular.br Also designing SVG is easeer and sometimes may produce better results.br My question is should I use CSS always for the layout, and for instance combine divs to achieve the nonrectangular effect or should I use SVG for some of the layout itemsbr Also what about the buttons CSS or SVGbr Thanksp
Negative 4088 pAfter spawning a subprocess using the Python codesubprocesscode library, Im using codestderrcode to pass a message from the child process to the parent process containing some serialized data.

Negative 4088 pIm totally confused and have no idea how to do this, so please forgive me if my descriptioninformation is bad.p  pSo I want say to do a notification via djangonotification or simply send an email to one of my user when a post of his had ended like on ebay.  In my database I have a model which stores the datetime of when the post is going to end, but Im not sure how to effectively check or store a signal or something which would alert the system to alert the user when the current time is  than the end datetime.p  pthanksp  pSince I want to send an emailnotification the second a post ends, I dont think I can use a scheduler to check if any post had ended, I believe this would be too inefficient, because I would have to check like every second, but like I said above, Im not sure about anything...p

Negative 4088 pi am trying to put a headtag and a foot tag inside struct mallocchunk, like thisp  precode  struct mallocshunk         INTERNALSIZE prevsize        INTERNALSIZE size         codepre  pHere is what i didp  p1.p  precode  struct mallocshunk         INTERNALSIZE foottag        INTERNALSIZE prevsize        INTERNALSIZE size         codepre  pbefore putting the headtag inside mallocchunk, i just added foottag only and compiled glibc. I made a small test program that mallocs 60 bytes from the system and then frees it. Thou i can see that the malloc returned properly, free complained, saying invalid pointer. The pointer malloc returned was 0x9313010. That makes the pointer to the start of mallocchunk to be 0x9313004.  So when the free is passed 0x9313010, it converts it to 0x9313004 through mem2chunk and the check it for alignment. Since my wordsize is 4, alignment check with 0x9313010 is where i am getting problems. Can you please tell me if the Mem pointer returned by malloc needs to be absolutely doubleword aligned. as here it may not satisfy that criterion, as difference betwwen the pointer returned by malloc and start of chunk will be 12 bytes here and not 8.p  ol lipTo ever come 1. issue , i just added 1 headtag to the structure so that it becomesp  pstruct mallocshunk         INTERNALSIZE foottag        INTERNALSIZE prevsize        INTERNALSIZE size        INTERNALSIZE headtag         Now the difference betwwen the pointer returned by malloc and start of chunk will be 16 which will always be double word aligned. But Here i am facing a bigger problem as the time when first malloc is called the arena is setup and bins are initallised. The size of the victim here is not coming out to be zero as it should be in normal cases. The problem is that the victimsize is actually comes out to be the place where top is stored rather than lastremainder. id like to ask for you opinion if there is any other wayworkaroundsolution, so that i can over come this initialization of arena issue i am currently facing.pli ol  pThanks and Regards, Kapilp
Negative 4088 pI am embarking on creating a Yii project that basically has a shared data model lets say codeCerealStuffcode with a frontend web site call it codesitecode, admin site codeadmincode, and web service codewscode. I am new to the whole MVC thing and I wanted to know how I should design this project to stay consistent with YiiMVC best practices. So far I have identified two basic optionsp  ol liCreate models codeCerealStuffcode at root, create three modules codesitecode, codeadmincode, and codewscode each with their own controllersli liCreate models codeCerealStuffcode at root, create two modules codeadmincode and codepubliccode with codepubliccode containing controllers that handle Site and have soap declarations to handle ws stuff.li ol  pI know that option 2 reduces the total amount of reproduced coding but it does not feel as clean quite honestly. Also I feel like maybe a modern web app should be such that even the site view uses the web service to access the database.p  pTell me what to thinkp

Negative 4088 pI have implemented the Huffman Encoding Algorithm in Java using Priority Queues where I traverse the Tree from Root to Leaf and get encoding example as 000011 based on the number of times the symbol appears in the input. Everything is fine, the tree is being built fine, encoding is just as expected But the output file I am getting is bigger size than the original file. I am currently appending 0 amp 1 to a String on traversing left node and right node of the tree. Probably what I end up with uses all 8 bits for each characters and it does not help in compression. I am guessing there is some conversion of these bits into character values which is required. So that these characters use fewer bits than 8 and hence I get a compressed version of the original file. Could you please let me know how to achieve a compression by manipulating characters and reducing bits in Java Thanks  p

Now I understand I need to manipulate the alpha properties of the logo but not sure how I would run the code once the button is clicked.

Since Im retrieving the files from the server anyways, I am considering rewriting it in PHP to shave off a few seconds.

Negative 4088 pIm currently taking a beginning class on C. The professor is all gungho about IDEs I am not. Fine and well. The problem is that he wants all assignments turned in using the Solutions that MS Visual Studio 2010 creates. I only have Ubuntu at home.p  pNow, there are two things I can do already First, I can just do my homework at my schools computer lab. Or, second, since the assignments are simple, I could just make my .cpp and header files on a text editor at home, bring them to the computer lab, and make the Solutions there.p  pWhat I am wondering is there a way I can not only read the solution folders which there seem to be some complicated methods for but also store them in the format that Visual Studio likes If there is, would it save me the 20  30 minutes per class period that going to the computer lab would cost mep  pThanks.p

It works well.    With Firefox, those information is stored in the prefs.js file. I can   read or write information requisite to this file easily. With Chrome,   those information is stored in two files in user profile folder   Preferences and Web Data files. The Preferences file is a JSON file. I   get those information easily by parsing this JSON file. But to set   search engine provider information for Chrome. We need to change those   information in Web Data file. Web Data file is a SQLite file. I use   SQLite library to access this.p      pWith Internet Explorer, I can get those information in that registry   path. But I cant set those information with that registry path. So, I   think, like Chrome, IE or registry needs to change those information   somewhere. But I dont know where.p blockquote

Negative 4088 pIm trying to add an array into an SQLite Database on an iPhone.  The thing is, I do not know how many array objects the user will want to use.  It may be 1, it may be 10.  If I allocated 10 fields in a SQLite Table, that would be 9 wastes if the user was to use one, and it would put an upper bound to 10 entries.p  pThus I thought of using a single VARCHAR type field, and adding each object of the array with a special character between each objects. How would this be performance wise Any better ideasp
Negative 4088 pOkay so Im having an issue with a current assignment trust me this is a minuscule part of it as we are required to write in C code and not C, and we are not allowed to change certain parts of code. So I have a struct definedp  precode    typedef struct someStruct      int what     int something[MAX]     int another[MAX]  someType codepre  pin main I initialize all the values in a defined structp  precodesomeType whatever, whatptr codepre  pEDITof course set the pointer to the struct, trying to simplify the code for the example It is present in my code alreadyp  precodewhatptr  ampwhatever whatever.what  0  initialize both arrays to hold 0 at all indexes  Then I must call a function progRun progRun  I need to pass struct whatever in some way codepre  pNow progRun looks like thisp  precodevoid progRun printWhatampwhatever      if whatever.what  0      do stuff        codepre  pI cant change anything inside this code except what parameters to pass inside the progRun function and I can add stuff before printWhat. Ive tried changing progRun top  precodevoid progRunsomeType stptr codepre  pthen calling it in main asp  precodeprogRunwhatptr codepre  pbut this causes a stack overflow issue for some reason, Ive tried stepping through with a debugger and it only occurs when the function is called. Is there a better way to pass the whatever struct to the function so it can be passed into progRun and printWhat and can access whatever.whatp  pAny help would be greatly appreciated in the meantime Ill try to figure it myself if I can.p  pEDIT Something else must be wrong in the code even though everything else has compiled and ran perfectly fine until this code was added. If I can break down the code and find out whats wrong Ill update the question. And no I cannot post the whole code as it is an assignment this isnt the goal of the assignment trust me it focuses on data forwarding and more, just need to get this basic thing working Thank you for help everyone.p  pEDIT the MAX number used in the struct for something[MAX] and another[MAX] was extremely large  I left my desktop that I started this project with back home, Im currently using an old laptop that cant handle large arrays. All the answers below, and some of the stuff I used before now works fine.p

Negative 4088 pWhile working on a Spring 3 MVC project using Hibernate, we encountered an annoying error. We are creating a carpool application. People can add routes using the Gmap 3 plugin for jQuery and can add waypoints to their route. In the database, a waypoint has a foreign key to a route. When trying to update a route addingremoving waypoints and resaving the route, we get the found two representations of the same collection error. Weve researched the Internet but mostly the topics talk about the Play framework we dont use that and furthermore they talk about annotations as mapping method while we use XML mappings.

Parameter zFilename points to a nulterminated string containing the  name of the database file on disk to load from or save to. If parameter  isSave is nonzero, then the contents of the file zFilename are   overwritten with the contents of the database opened by pInMemory. If  parameter isSave is zero, then the contents of the database opened by  pInMemory are replaced by data loaded from the file zFilename.   If the operation is successful, SQLITEOK is returned. Otherwise, if  an error occurs, an SQLite error code is returned.  int loadOrSaveDbsqlite3 pInMemory, const char zFilename, int isSave   int rc                    Function return code    sqlite3 pFile            Database connection opened on zFilename    sqlite3backup pBackup   Backup object used to copy data    sqlite3 pTo              Database to copy to pFile or pInMemory    sqlite3 pFrom            Database to copy from pFile or pInMemory      Open the database file identified by zFilename.

Otherwise, if this is a save operation isSave1, then data      is copied from pInMemory to pFile.  Set the variables pFrom and      pTo accordingly.      pFrom  isSave  pInMemory  pFile     pTo    isSave  pFile      pInMemory       Set up the backup procedure to copy from the main database of       connection pFile to the main database of connection pInMemory.

If the backup object is successfully created, call backupstep      to copy data from pFile to pInMemory. Then call backupfinish      to release resources associated with the pBackup object.  If an      error occurred, then  an error code and message will be left in      connection pTo.

Negative 4088 pThought Id try to hack the NCAA bracket this year by creating a model that would just use simple probability to help determine a final bracket for instance, how likely is it for a 1 seed to win their first game, how likely is it for a 2 seed to win their first game etc.p  pThis is how I think Im going to set up each mongo document each document corresponds to a year.p  precode   year 1999,   round1 [1,2,3,5,6,7,9,13,17,18...],  32 entries   round2 [1,3,5,7,17,18...],           16 entries   round3 [1,7,17,19,33,34,49,51],      8 entries   round4 [7,17,34,49],                 4 entries   round5 [7,34],                       2 entries   round6 [7]                           1 entry  codepre  pHowever, I want to make this easy, and this would still be annoying in terms of data entry having to enter this for 30 different years would be really annoying. What this would be good for, would be tracking. First it would be easy if team won its first game by checking to see if 17 is in the array in round1. Secondly, you could do easy calculations on which seed the team was by looking at their number mod 16 so team 17 is really a one seed 171mod 16. But maybe theres an easier way to set up this database and manipulate it. Any ideasp

Negative 4088 pIm new to stackoverflow, but was hoping for a little insight from more advanced programmers. I am switching majors to Computer Science next semester and am taking an intro class learning some beginners Python programming. I have already finished the program below the assignment was to make a program that draws ovals on the window surface by filling in some of the professors code, not too bad at all but I wanted to add a little something extra As you can see, I have the color of the ovals set to be random, but it stays the same until the program is restarted entirely i.e. all of the ovals are that particular color for the length of the program. With the code written the way it is, I cant figure out a way to get the color to change for each oval. Keep in mind, this is all for kicks, but if anyones feeling especially helpful or creative, Im curious to see what you have to say. Let me know if I can expound on anything.

Negative 4088 pI am currently starting the development of a new website using ASP.Net Webforms. To give this project a proper start I am investigating a visual studio solution setup for the application, where I want my application to consist of easily recognizable components that are equal in size lines of code.p  pSince the project is hasnt actually started yet I have structured the solution in a standard three tier setup data, business logic and presentation. This setup is fine at the start of the project but as the project grows the three tiers will soon start to become big and navigating and finding code will become harder which will hurt maintainability and overall feel of quality.p  pSo during the project I want to convert to a new setup where I form functional components that each has their own three tier setup. For example the website has a shopping cart and options to create and manage a user account. There should also be component for stull used across multiple components, which I will call common for this example. That would lead to the following setupp  pThe common filesp  ul liProject.Common.Datali liProject.Common.Businessli liProject.Common.Presentationsli ul  pThe shopping cartp  ul liProject.Shoppingcart.Datali liProject.Shoppingcart.Businessli liProject.Shoppingcart.Presentationsli ul  pThe account managementp  ul liProject.Account.Datali liProject.Account.Businessli liProject.Account.Presentationsli ul  pThe websitep  ul liProject.Website.Datali liProject.Website.Businessli liProject.Website.Presentationsli ul  pThe sample above has three components that each contains three projects. Each component has one web application project that contains web files pages, controls, frontend code. All my previous .Net project all had a simple web application project, so this setup is a new experience for me. p  pI still want the solution to feel as one application, being able to debug the website and the components with ease. To achieve this I assume the Project.Web.Presentation web application project should be the main web application project. I am currently investigating if it is possible to setup a solution this way, I have tried several approaches but none have worked well so farp  ul lipRunning all the web application project separately, this worked fine but I have to run all the application separately and I cannot run them under the same port which is terrible when debugging.pli lipAdding files from other presentation projects as links to the Project.Web.Presentation project and set that project as startup project. This doesnt work as the files arent present at debug time, seems to work fine when building a deployment package. I do not want to copy the files since I have to somehow prevent those duplicate files from ending up in version control.pli ul  pSo far I havent found a good way to work with setup I have in mind.  I am open to suggestions, thanks in advance for the tipsp

Negative 4088 pWe used to have SSRS 2005 and were using ReportViewer v9 in our asp.net environment. In order to implement the height of the control correctly 100 I went through a whole bunch of resizing javascript functions and other hacks. My understanding was that the v9 of the control could not render the height as 100 because of the IFRAME it was using.    Right now we upgraded to SSRS 2008 and I am implementing ReportViewer v10 control. Unfortunately, even though this version does not use the IFRAME anymore it seems like the height issue is still here.    Has anyone implemented the asp.net ReportViewer v10 control with width100, height100 and  AsyncRenderingtrue correctly I want to get rid of all the extra javascripthacks from previous version, but I am not sure I can, since it seems like the height issue is still there.

Negative 4088 pIve tried to insert BLOB data with SQL developer. But I cant find the insert statements which are actually used to insert BLOB data. p  pApart from that, the database speed is really slow. For small files, it executes fine. But when I tried to import 50 mb avi file into BLOB, it took 34 minutes amp still it was not completed. When I tried to export the BLOB data to a file, exporting process was also slow. I was using Oracle 10g Express Edition. If the database speed is slower than even filesystem speed, then why database are used for storing BLOB data Is there any other way to optimize the performance  p

Negative 4088 pWith the iPhone 5 and other armv7s devices now appearing, there are compatibility problems with existing closedsource 3rdparty frameworks such as Flurry which are built without this newer architecture.p  pOne option is to wait until they release a new build, but I was hoping there might be a compiler flag or something I can use in my Xcode project that would let the linker know not to expect armv7s architecture from this framework, and use the armv7 instead. Does anything like this existp
Negative 4088 pMy iOS app recognises pan gestures and I want to save the results of the pan moving an object onscreen to NSUserDefaults.p  pMy gesture recogniser method works on both StateChanged and StateEnded messages and its in here that I write the new position of the objectas moved by the pan to NSUserDefaults.p  phowever, I understand that writing to NSUserDefaults may be quite expensive, and Im really only interested in saving the new position when the user has finished the pan, so should I only save synchronise NSUserDefaults when I get a StateEnded message from the gesture recogniserp  pThanks,p  pStevep

For Eclipse, it is pretty much like that. But I could not find similar functionality in Xcode not expert as you can tell.p  pReally appreciate your help.p

However, I get the Creating default object from empty value warning which comes from the line in the included file where Ive noted above.p  pIn the posts that Ive seen regarding this kind of warning, the solution always seems to be that you must set a class or something to the variable name in this case clsLayoutDefinition prior to assigning items to it.  Unfortunately, I seem to be doing that here yet I am still receiving that warning.p  pPlease keep in mind that Im working with code that was originally written by someone else and Im not yet too familiar with how classesobjects work.p  pI omitted some of the code for readability and relevance purposes, but if you think that theres something else at play here and need to see more of the code I can post some more.  Just try to be specific if theres a particular part you need to see, if possible.p  pAnyway, this is work related so I hope I can find a solution quickly.p  pOn a side note, when I originally encountered this issue days ago I solved it by setting codeglobal clsLayoutDefinitioncode at the beginning of the GetLayout function.  However, tonight while working on the site I had encountered a really confusing problem and narrowed it down to that global declaration.  When I remove the global declaration, the other more serious problem goes away, but then I get the warning.p  pThanks in advance for any helpp

Negative 4088 pLet me explain a little about us. We are a group of developers who have a dedicated server for our team, but it is still administered by another group that enforces organization wide policy.

My implementation as of now is as followsp  pMainPage.xaml.csp  precodeprotected override void OnNavigatedToNavigationEventArgs e              base.OnNavigatedToe          string title  null         NavigationContext.QueryString.TryGetValueParam, out title          if title  null                      ConnectionSettingsTask connectionSettingsTask  new ConnectionSettingsTask                              switch title                              case WiFi                                             connectionSettingsTask.ConnectionSettingsType  ConnectionSettingsType.WiFi                     connectionSettingsTask.Show                     break                  ...                           try                                                   NavigationService.RemoveBackEntry                 title  null                 NavigationContext.QueryString.Removetitle                          catchInvalidOperationException ex                              MessageBox.Showex.Message                             private void CreateLiveTileTileItem item              var title  item.Title.ToString         string tileParameter  Param  item.Title.ToString                      ShellTile Tile  CheckIfTileExisttileParameter   Check if Tiles title has been used                       if Tile  null                      choose which original background tile image to use             switch title                              case WiFi                                                 background  new UriImagesModeModeWiFi.png, UriKind.Relative                      break                 ...                           try                              var LiveTile  new StandardTileData                                      Title  item.TileName,                     BackgroundImage  background,                     BackTitle  item.TileName,                     BackBackgroundImage  new Uribackground.png, UriKind.Relative,                     BackContent  item.Message,                                   ShellTile.Createnew UriViewMainPage.xaml  tileParameter, UriKind.Relative, LiveTile  pass the tile parameter as the QueryString                                             catch Exception                              MessageBox.ShowThis tile could not be pinned, Warning, MessageBoxButton.OK                               else                      MessageBox.ShowThis tile has already been pinned, Notice, MessageBoxButton.OK                private ShellTile CheckIfTileExiststring tileUri              ShellTile shellTile  ShellTile.ActiveTiles.FirstOrDefaulttile gt tile.NavigationUri.ToString.ContainstileUri         return shellTile      codepre  pSo, essentially the creation of the tile and pinning the secondary tile to the start screen works, as well as loading the WiFI ConnectionSettingsTask from the secondary tile. But when I try to navigate back from the ConnectionSettingsTask page, it just keeps reloading that page. How might I fix this issue according to the Windows Phone hardware back button certification requirements must return to start screen in this scenariop

you can see I have 3 image buttons.Under them a table layout with 6 rows.After that another table layout which is populated dynamically and under that a horizontal scroll view which is populated dynamically with pictures,and an image button for adding new pictures.p  pNow,my problem is that every time i open the activity,after the pictures are loaded in the horizontal scroll view, the last row from my first table layout is disappearingis not disappearing completely  but its width is getting very small and it only fits one letter per row. I think that after the pictures are loaded the entire layout is redrawing itself and the first table doesnt maintain his propertiesthe weight property also doest apply anymore after the pictures are loaded.I could really use some help.  Any suggestions will be appreciated. Thx.p

Negative 4088 pWhat Im developing is a web page that allows the user to enter math equations and phrases into a visual space, without the use of an actual keyboard. So far what I have is the visual space, which is a contenteditable div tag, as well as an area underneath with input buttons for placing numbers and mathematical symbols into said div. Now what I need is some way of allowing the user to enter fractions into the div. I thought of maybe somehow using Javascript to go into and out of subscriptsuperscript mode and stacking numbers on top of each other separated by a line, and then have a button signifying that the user has finished entering numbers into the fraction, but my knowledge of JS is very limited at this point. How would I go about doing thisp

Negative 4088 pI started going through the Core Data Tutorial for iOS at developer.apple.com but am stuck just a few paragraphs in.  It says to create a new project using the WindowBased Application template which doesnt seem to exist in my version of xcode 4.5.1 so I used Single View Application instead.  The problem then is theres no xcdatamodeld file that should have been provided by the template, and the app delegate properties like NSManagedObjectContext that it discusses are also missing.p  pIs there an updated tutorial for 4.5.1 from Apple that covers this materialp  pThanks a lot.p
Negative 4088 pIve been suffering from severe performance problems rendering a regularly updated image to the iphone.  After trying it on the iPad 3 today I found out that I was only getting 2fps.  This was WAAAY too slow.  As such I decided to profile and found that nearly all the time was spent converting the image into a 32bit ARGB image after the UIImage drawInRect.  Im seriously shocked at how awful the performance is given everyone says UIKit renders using OpenGLES.p  pSo I converted the rendering code to GLES1 I cant be bothered to set up a GLES2 renderer at the mo .  The performance has shot up.  Im now getting 20fps.  In fact the performance is so good Im beginning to wonder whether I can perform full retina renderingp  pAnyway I am creating the texture as followsp  precodeglTexImage2D GLTEXTURE2D, 0, GLRGBA, width, height, 0, GLRGBA, GLUNSIGNEDSHORT5551, ampcolours.front  codepre  pUnfortunately this reverses the component order.  I have fixed it by reversing the bit order fromp  precodeval      rgba.a gtgt 7 ltlt 15  rgba.b gtgt 3 ltlt 10  rgba.g gtgt 3 ltlt 5  rgba.r gtgt 3 ltlt 0 codepre  ptop  precodeval      rgba.r gtgt 3 ltlt 11  rgba.g gtgt 3 ltlt 6  rgba.b gtgt 3 ltlt 1  rgba.a gtgt 7 ltlt 0 codepre  pSo this confirms that the component order is reversed over CGImage.  However this code is used in multiple products so I need to come up with a way of loading the component reversed image.p  pAs such I found the flag GLUNSIGNEDSHORT1555REV but I cant get it to work.p  pIve tried the following codep  precodeglTexImage2D GLTEXTURE2D, 0, GLRGBA, width, height, 0, GLRGBA, GLUNSIGNEDSHORT1555REV, ampcolours.front  codepre  pandp  precodeglTexImage2D GLTEXTURE2D, 0, GLBGRA, width, height, 0, GLBGRA, GLUNSIGNEDSHORT1555REV, ampcolours.front  codepre  pbut both return me GLINVALIDENUM.

Negative 4088 pI would like to know if it is possible to write a FF plugin which will, once a certain page is loaded, produce a listing of all the JS functions and give the user the option to disable or keep enabled a certain function.p  pI got the idea for this from FB.  I have been getting quite irate by the FB news feed self refreshing while I am in the middle of reading or commenting on something and then it gets pushed down the screen and I cant find it cause my feed is like 2 mi long.p  pHowever, I do not want to completely turn JS off.  I want to be able to set which are welcome functions and which are not.  Self refresh and disabling back action are, in my book, the rudest JS functions for any site that irritate the cp out of me.p  pSuch envisioned plugin would then save the preferences for the particular URL so they would be loaded upon revisit, much like a cookie.p  pHowever, if there is something like this already, that would be awesome and I wouldnt have to reinvent the wheel.p

Negative 4088 pIm trying to develop a plugin for Rhino which generates architectural floor plans based on Shape Grammars. The plugin is written in C using the RhinoCommon API. Using different rules, represented as genes in a chromosome, I transform a starting geometry. Using GA, a fitness function determines the optimum sequence of transformation rules to generate a geometry that matches parametric criteria area, views, minimal construction, etc..p  pAs the geometry represents architecture, there are some constructive rules to adhere to. My question is about the general approach of Genetic Algorithms strongWhen do I check the validity of the geometry created by the chromosomestrong At the gene insertion point or do I just give invalid geometries a bad fitness valuep  pWhen I add a gene representing a geometric transformation operation to the chromosome, I can check if this leads to invalid geometry. For example My starting shape is a rectanglep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comaCRAb.jpg altrectanglep  pOne transformation option is to divide one rectangle side in two parts. The gene would look something like this [DIVIDETOP0.25]. This will create a side containing of two segments, split at the quarter markp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comZLZ2x.jpg altsplit rectanglep  pIf I already know that a segment has to be of a certain length, this gene could be creating invalid geometry. In the example above the red segment on the top is too short. Do I implement this geometry check which could potentially be more complex for other rules than in the shown example at the geneinsertion point, or do I wait until the fitness function to validate it In this example a check would be that when I add a segmentsplit gene, I check if the resulting segments are within an allowed range Not checking could lead to a population consisting of chromosomes that generate invalid geometry, or individuals with a very bad fitness. Checking could guarantee a population with valid chromosomes, but the generation of the chromosomes could possibly take much longer.p  pstrongWhat would be a better strategystrong p

Negative 4088 pPlease bear in mind that I have never used Web Workers before and Im having some trouble wrapping my head around them.p  pHeres an explanation of a simplified version of what Im doing.p  pMy page has links to various files  some are text, some are images, etc. Each file has an image showing a generic file icon.p  pI want the script to replace each generic icon with a preview of the files contents.p  pThe script will request the file from the server thereby adding it to the cache, like a preloader, then create a canvas and draw the preview onto it a thumbnail for images, an excerpt of text for text files, a more specific icon for media files... and finally replace the generic icons source with the canvas using a data URL.p  pI can do this quite easily. However, I would prefer to have it in the background so that it doesnt interfere with the UI while its working.p  pBefore I dive right in to this, I need to know can Workers work with a canvas, and if so how would I create one I dont think codedocument.createElementcanvascode would work because Workers cant access the DOM, or am I misunderstanding when all the references Ive found say they cant access the DOMp

Negative 4088 pI am reading a bunch of binary files one at a time into memory to perform some operations on them and then saving them back to the disk. With small files, it works perfectly fine, however, with larger files there is quite a bit of concern that I have.p  pNow, assuming that the file I am reading is 25Mb large  this is what my code looks likep  precodepublic static byte[] returnEncryptedFileDataFile fileObj  byte[] fileData  FileUtils.readFileToByteArrayfileObj now performing some operations on fileData  return fileData      codepre  pRight after this code executes, I see 50Mb  MISC of extra space consumption which is fine because there would be 2 byte arrays  one is fileData as Ive defined and another one used by readFileToByteArray to perform the operation, each holding 25Mb of datap  pHowever, even after this method returns and is called again for the next file to be read, the memory held previously isnt released If the next file being read is 30Mb large, I see a memory consumption of 50Mb  60Mb  MISCp  pHow do I cleanup after reading the file to a byte array, performing some operations on it and then return it from a method. System.gc doesnt help as it does not execute the GC right away.. no way that I believe exists to deallocate memory p  pWhat am I doing wrong herep
Negative 4088 pBit of a thought exercise regarding seeding databases of rails apps across several services.p  h1Setuph1  pFor example, consider a super simplified example consisting of 4 services rails apps which communicate via client gems and each expose a basic API.p  precodeAuthService  userid, password  PropertyService userid, propertyid, address  UserService userid, userinfo  MortgageService  propertyid, mortgageid, currentcostofmortgage codepre  pBasically a user has many properties and each has a mortgage.

Hence it isnt very feasible as a mechanism for populating its service unless you disaggree.p  h1Questionh1  pWhen seeding this as a whole, you obviously want any user you refer to in the property service to also exist in the auth service and similarly for the other service relationships.p  pWhat would be the best way of seeding these services with sample data such that they all matched upp  h1Potential Methods Consideredh1  ol liCreate hard fixtures for each serviceli liCreate a database dump for each service and just directly import itli liUse Factory Girl and somehow figure out how to sync the idsli ol  pFactory girl would be nicest as it would let me change the data which is seeded fairly easily and add moreless data without issue.

Negative 4088 pI have a page with two datagrids. One reads the value from a database and allows selection. When the user selects a grid it adds the data to the second datagrid. This is the code I am using for thisp  precode    Protected Sub PageLoadByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs Handles Me.Load      Dim dc1 As New DataColumnNAME     Dim dc2 As New DataColumnPRICE     dt.Columns.Adddc1     dt.Columns.Adddc2     Dim dr1 As DataRow  dt.NewRow     GridView2.DataSource  dt     GridView2.DataBind End Sub codepre  pandp  precodeProtected Sub GridView1SelectedIndexChangedsender As Object, e As EventArgs Handles GridView1.SelectedIndexChanged         Dim dr1 As DataRow  dt.NewRow          dr10  Name.ToString         dr11  Price.ToString         dt.Rows.Adddr1         GridView2.DataSource  dt         GridView2.DataBind codepre  pNow, this works perfectly.... but this obviously would work under a forms service. In a web based enviroment whenever a user selects a value in Grid 1 it resets the values in Grid 2 and I need that multiple rows are added to the 2nd Datagrid every time the user selects a value.  The data adding is fired when the selectedindexchanged event takes place in GridView1. I think I need to save the data to a sessioncookie but I have no idea how would I do this in the case of a datagrid. Like, what should I save and how Id read it. Both Gridviews are under an Update Panel control so Postback should be instantaneous if needed. p  pSightly updated code...p  precodeProtected Sub PageLoadByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs Handles Me.Load     If Not IsPostBack Then         dt  DirectCastSessionPurchase, DataTable     Else         Dim dc1 As New DataColumnNAME         Dim dc2 As New DataColumnPRICE         dt.Columns.Adddc1         dt.Columns.Adddc2         Dim dr1 As DataRow  dt.NewRow         GridView2.DataSource  dt         GridView2.DataBind     End If End Sub codepre  pandp  precode            Dim dr1 As DataRow  dt.NewRow         Session.AddPurchase, dt         dr10  Name.ToString         dr11  Price.ToString         dt.Rows.Adddr1         dt  DirectCastSessionPurchase, DataTable         GridView2.DataSource  dt         GridView2.DataBind codepre

Negative 4088 pI recently installed Linux Mint Debian Edition  it was installed into a logical partition formatted to ext4 under a 40 GB extended partition that was previously used as a backuprecovery disk in Windows 7. It works quite well  the only problem is when I boot to Windows, then next time, Linux wont boot. I then need to use a recovery distro and run fsck.ext4 which detects some problems with group descriptors, fixes them and its all good again. My feeling is that Windows tries to mount and fix  defrag  whatever that partition which messes it up  I suspect that, because 1 it only happens after I boot to Windows, 2 Windows still displays the old recoverybackup disk D although you cannot access it and it doesnt show a freetotal space etc.. Any idea how to fix itp

Negative 4088 pI cant find a definitive answer to this question What is the actual, real, native, nowrapper gui toolkit of Ubuntup  pI may fundamentally misunderstand something about the way that it works in linux, but I know that in Windows, for example, there are the lowlevel C APIs that comprise Windowss native windowing tooklit, and then various wrappers such as that C library I cant remember the name of at the moment. But the actual native API is the C one.p  pOn linux, there is no native gui its just a kernel. But in Ubuntu theres X11, GTK, Qt, and others, and I dont know what the REAL native toolkit is. I know that at least for Ubuntu Touch Canonical is moving to Qt as the native toolkit, but even in that case, will Qt be the REAL native toolkit, or is it just going to be a wrapper around X11, Mir, or something elsep

Negative 4088 pA couple years ago I saw a fantastic presentation on machine learning based on using Google as the data source.  The idea was to leverage Google and Ruby to get more people involved in the concepts of machine learning since massive amounts of data are now readily accessible.

I realize that this wouldnt normally be a very good format to ask this question, however the content was so valuable and well presented that I felt we would all be enriched by having another pointer to this information.p  pAlthough I realize this is somewhat vague, Can anyone refer us to this original video presentation  p  pIf not, could you share some useful links that would get one started down this road of machine learning leveraging massive data sources that now exist and are generally availablep

Currently, there are several Github projects with similar implementations, but they are all written in Php.p  pstrongWhat is BigPipestrongp  pBigPipe is a system that Facebook has come up with that makes it seem that pages load faster.

Negative 4088 pSo, we all know recursive functions, right But what exactly is it, that makes a function recursive I had a small discussion in the comment section of another question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17680224lighteningeffectwithjavascriptcomment2575679117680224Lightening effect with javascripta that kind of challenged my view of recursive functions but it also left me with a quite unsatisfying lack of proper definition.p  pMy personal definition of recursive functions so far was the followingp  blockquote   pA function is recursive if it directly or indirectly invokes itselfp blockquote  pstrongNotestrong I will provide JavaScript code for the following examples, but Im sure they are pretty universal.p  pA simple example for such a recursive function could be thisp  precodefunction a      a  codepre  pbut also thisp  precodefunction a      b   function b      a  codepre  por even thisp  precodefunction a      setTimeouta, 1000  codepre  pNone of those functions computes anything but I would have still considered them recursive just because they invoke themselves.p  pOne thing that came up was, that the third example is not recursive because it uses codesetTimeoutcode and therefor the stack is unwound. It also isnt recursive because after returning from the codencodeth invocation it doesnt give back control to the coden1codeth invocation.p  pAnother point, that was raised, was that none of those functions were recursive because they all dont compute an actual problem in a recursive way. Meaning that a problem has to be solved by dividing it in smaller and smaller instances. Here the quoted Wikipedia articlep  blockquote   pRecursion in computer programming is exemplified when a function is   defined in terms of simpler, often smaller versions of itself. The   solution to the problem is then devised by combining the solutions   obtained from the simpler versions of the problem.p blockquote  pSo this is recursivep  precodefunction facn      if n lt 0          return 1          return n  facn  1  codepre  pBut this wouldnt bep  precodefunction facn      if n lt 0          return 1          console.logn     facn  1  codepre  pSo what is the proper definition of a recursive function Is there any at all or is it really just a philosophical question What features must a function have, in order to be classified recursivep

Negative 4088 pIm using a web service to query a ticketing interface and pull back all support tickets that are open at any point in time, displaying them in a nice neat table within an iframe as part of our web application. My application is written in PLSQL however I use this to construct my HTML pages and the content that is displayed within my iframe. My main issue is that because the tickets are made up of Email content, there is a lot of useless rubbish mostly  tags and irrelevant text that is included at the top of the Email content which causes my interface to look trashy. p  pWithin my code I am wrapping the main areas of content that I require in a table with an ID of ticketsTable and would like to remove any elements or content within the iframe only that occurs before this tickets table.p  pUsually I would use jQuery for this taskp  precodeearliercontent.nextUntilticketsTable.andSelf.remove codepre  phowever, our system is built using ExtJS so we wish to avoid any potential conflict the jQuery library could cause with this environment. I therefore need a way to process and loop through the contents of the iframe, removing all elements and text that occur before the ticketTable id therefore eradicating all of the unnecessary content.p  pIve already tried this  p  precodevar last  null var curr  page1 while curr.attrid  ticketsTable      if last  null          last.remove          last  curr     curr  curr.next  if last  null      last.remove  codepre  pSource a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5756159jqueryremoveallelementsuntilidwhateverfoundjQuery remove all elements until id39whatever39 foundap  phowever, as the Email content is variable, there is no specific ID tag I can specify for the script to start at. Therefore, is there an alternative method I can use without a library, just pure JavaScript to remove all elements and content before the ticketsTablep  pI must stress that the contents of the ticketsTable must remain intact. It is only the content that occur before this within the body that I wish to remove.p

So I added a column codeCostCentercode. If its codeNULLcode then it means the user can view all cost centers. The problem now some other permissions, for example codeViewThatcode needs to be customized as well, the problem is the customization or limitation does not target a certain cost center, it does target other factors, for example a contract type. So users with the permission codeViewThatcode should be limited to employees with certain contract type. So I added another column codeContractTypeIDcode. This column should be ignored in permissions where this field is not required. Sometimes a certain permission requires two or more of the customizationlimitation fields.p  pThe problem now, the table is growing horizontally whenever I need to add a customizationlimitation to a permission. Is there a better way or best practice in dealing with such dilemma p

Negative 4088 pI have an Nginx reverse proxy on the same machine as my origin server. I want the proxy to cache dynamic content from the origin, but when a client revalidates a resource, I want the proxy to revalidate with the origin too, and not just return a 304 to the client without checking the origin.p  pFor example if I set maxage to 60 seconds, the proxy will happily return 304 for that period without ever checking the origin. Ive set up a test where the origin generates a new etag every second, like this using node.js expressp  precodeapp.getdynamicfile, functionreq, res   var filename  req.params.file   var filepath  path.joindirname, files, filename   res.setHeaderCacheControl, public, mustrevalidate, proxyrevalidate, maxage60, smaxage60   res.setHeaderETag, filenameetagCounter   res.sendfilefilepath   console.logrequest, requestCounter   console.logetag, etagCounter   console.logdate, new Date.toISOString  codepre  pAnd in Nginx the route that passes this request is configured like thisp  precodelocation cache    accesslog on    addheader Vary AcceptEncoding    addheader XAppServer upstreamaddr            Backend Server  Port   addheader XAppServerStatus upstreamstatus   Backend HTTP Status   addheader XCache upstreamcachestatus        HIT  MISS  BYPASS  EXPIRED    proxyredirect      off   proxysetheader    XRealIP            remoteaddr   proxysetheader    XForwardedFor      proxyaddxforwardedfor   proxysetheader    XForwardedProto    scheme   proxysetheader    Host                 httphost   proxysetheader    XNginXProxy        true   proxysetheader    Connection               proxycache         one   proxycachekey     schemeproxyhosturiisargsargs    proxypass httplocalhost4444  codepre  pWhen the client talks directly to Express, I see 304s returned by Express, but when there is the proxy in between Express never returns a 304 to Nginx. Nginx serves from cache and only just gets the resource from the origin when maxage has passed.p  pTo be sure I put the etag refresh interval at 60 seconds and the maxage at 1. As a result Nginx will get a new resource every second from the origin without revalidating, so a 200 response, and will then return a 304 to the client until the etag changes after 60 seconds.p  pMy conclusion is that Nginx never revalidates with the origin server. It just gets a new copy of the resource whenever it thinks it needs one according to maxage.p  pIs there a way to do what I want Does it not respect the proxyrevalidate header, or am I not taking the right approachp  p[EDIT]p  pIve since found an answer a hrefhttpodino.orgrestbetterhttpcache relnofollowherea. From this article I make up 2 solutions. p  p1 The mustrevalidateproxyrevalidate in the cached response should be enough for nginx to trigger a revalidate when receiving maxage0 in a request.p  p2 When a client sends nocache in a CC header, the proxy should definitely do a revalidation with the origin. p  pFrom my tests both dont seem to work. For example Im doing a request like thisp  precodecurl httplocalhost9088cachedynamicimage.jpg H IfNoneMatch image.jpg0 H AcceptEncoding gzip,deflate,sdch H Host localhost9088 H AcceptLanguage enUS,enq0.8 H UserAgent Mozilla5.0 Macintosh Intel Mac OS X 1085 AppleWebKit537.36 KHTML, like Gecko Chrome29.0.1547.76 Safari537.36 H Accept texthtml,applicationxhtmlxml,applicationxmlq0.9,q0.8 H CacheControl nocache, maxage0 H Cookie octane.sids3AUa64F6fk2Pw0uwZ28e7OICyv.z2FNPYjQ72Fn2F3vZGXV7B3QBYtqN2FHzjV1e3XTuZcnmwduE4SBFEPDv3zE3zRuA4Ae705RtI6Z2BBrqJyMveSjNA H Connection keepalive H IfModifiedSince Thu, 06 Sep 2012 092153 GMT compressed I codepre  pIt contains codeH CacheControl nocache, maxage0code, but I still get served content from the nginx cache without it checking the origin. p  pIs Nginx behaving bad in this regard Im using version 1.5.4p

Negative 4088 pIm reviewing some legacy code and came across a snippet which seems like it will throw unwanted exceptions.  In essence the code an EntityFramework query looks like the followingp  precodevar serviceId  Guid person.Services.FirstOrDefaults gt s.Name  foo.Id bool inService  serviceId.HasValue codepre  pThat is, a codepersoncode has multiple services assigned to them, and were returning the first service whose codeNamecode is codefoocode.  Then, we get the Id property a Guid on that codeServicecode instance, and cast it to a nullable Guid.  Finally, if that nullable Guid has a value, then the person must be in that service.p  pNote this is not how I would choose to write the above, its just what Im working withp  pI have a feeling that this code simply throws exceptions when the person does not belong to a service with the name foo or really, any service at all, because the codeFirstOrDefaultcode invocation will return a codenullcode codeServicecode instance, and accessing the codeIdcode property will just throw an NPE.p  pI asked the original developer about this snippet, and I was told that doing the followingp  precodeT entity.ltnonexistent entitygt.SomeProperty codepre  pWill simply return a null object, instead of throwing an NPE.  Also, this type of safe null handling occurs with Entity Framework queries.p  pThis seems incredibly counterintuitive, and doesnt even feel like it should be possible.  I tried researching this, but I havent found anything along those lines.  Does anyone have any experience with this  Im 100 happy to find out that Im wrong and to learn something new, but it does not feel correct to me.p  pemAs an addendum, I did try running the query above in Linqpad by using the EntityFramework connection, and I did indeed generate an NPE when trying to access the null objects propertyem p

Negative 4088 h2The motivationh2  pLets say Im writing a codeTreecode class. I will represent nodes of the tree by a codeTreeNodecode class. Methods of the class might return codeTreeNodecode objects and take them as arguments, such as a method which gets the parent of a node codeNode getParentNodecode.p  pIll also want a codeSpecialTreecode class. codeSpecialTreecode should extend the interface of a codeTreecode and be usable anywhere a codeTreecode is.p  pBehind the scenes, codeTreecode and codeSpecialTreecode might have totally different implementations. For example, I might use a librarys codeGraphAcode class to implement a codeTreecode, so that codeTreeNodecode is a thin wrapper or a typedef for a codeGraphANodecode. On the other hand, codeSpecialTreecode might be implemented in terms of a codeGraphBcode object, and a codeTreeNodecode wraps a codeGraphBNodecode.p  pIll later have functions which deal with trees, like a depthfirst search function. This function should accept both codeTreecode and codeSpecialTreecode objects interchangeably.p  h2The patternh2  pI will use a templated interface class to define the interface for a tree and a special tree. The template argument will be the implementation class. For examplep  precodetemplate lttypename Implementationgt class TreeInterface      public     typedef typename ImplementationNode Node      virtual Node addNode  0     virtual Node getParentNode  0    class TreeImplementation      GraphA graph         public     typedef GraphANode Node      Node addNode  return graph.addNode      Node getParent   ...return the parent...     class Tree  public TreeInterfaceltTreeImplementationgt      TreeImplementation impl      public     Tree  implnew TreeImplementation     Tree  delete impl       virtual Node addNode  return implgtaddNode      virtual Node getParent  return implgtgetParent    codepre  pI could then derive codeSpecialTreeInterfacecode from codeTreeInterfacecodep  precodetemplate lttypename Implementationgt class SpecialTreeInterface  public TreeInterfaceltImplementationgt      virtual void specialTreeFunction  0  codepre  pAnd define codeSpecialTreecode and codeSpecialTreeImplementationcode analogously to codeTreecode and codeTreeImplementationcode.p  pMy depthfirst search function might look like thisp  precodetemplate lttypename Tgt void depthFirstSearchTreeInterfaceltTgtamp tree codepre  pand since codeSpecialTreecode derives from codeTreeInterfacecode, this will work for codeTreecode objects and codeSpecialTreecode objects.p  h2Alternativesh2  pAn alternative is to rely more heavily on templates so that codeSpecialTreecode isnt a descendent of codeTreeInterfacecode in the type hierarchy at all. In this case, my DFS function will look like codetemplate lttypename Tgt depthFirstSearchTamp treecode. This also throws out the rigidly defined interface describing exactly what methods a codeTreecode or its descendents should have. Since a codeSpecialTreecode should emalwaysem act like a codeTreecode, but provide some additional methods, I like the use of an interface.p  pInstead of the codeTreeInterfacecode template parameter being the implementation, I could make it take a representation class that defines what a codeNodecode looks like it will also have to define what an codeArccode looks like, and so on. But since Ill potentially need one of these for each of the implementations, I think Id like to keep this together with the implementation class itself.p  pWhat do I gain by using this pattern Mostly, a looser coupling. If Id like to change the implementation behind codeTreecode, codeSpecialTreecode doesnt mind at all because it only inherits the interface.p  h2The questionsh2  pSo, does this pattern have a name Im using the handlebody pattern by storing a pointer to codeContourTreeImplementationcode in codeContourTreecode. But what about the approach of having a templateized interface Does this have a namep  pIs there a better way to do this It does seem that I am repeating myself a lot, and writing a lot of boilerplate code, but those nested codeNodecode classes give me trouble. If codeTreeNodecode and codeSpecialTreeNodecode had reasonably similar implementations, I could define a codeNodeInterfacecode interface for a codeNodecode in codeTreeInterfacecode, and override the implementation of the node class in codeTreecode and codeSpecialTreecode. But as it is, I cant guarantee that this is true. codeTreeNodecode may wrap a codeGraphANodecode, and codeSpecialTreeNodecode may wrap an integer. So this method wont quite work, but it seems like there might still be room for improvement. Any thoughtsp

When I enable my face culling, I have unexpected results.

As an example, the box in the middle of the plane need only have a top face and a bottom face.  All other faces can be discarded because they simply wont ever be seen anywhere.p  pI checked each box within the code to determine if they had the correct faces culled, and I believe they do.

Negative 4088 pToday, HTML  tags support title attributes on all major browsers.  When you hover over an option in a drop down list, the title will appear as a tooltip.  What event allows the title to displayp  pI should state that this is my first time asking a question.  In keeping with the guidelines, I have researched this quite thoroughly to the best of my ability but I am not an expert in this area.  This topic has been covered repeatedly but there has never been a definitive answer at least I cant find one.  I have coded many approaches and all of them work in Firefox but not in any other commonly used browser.  I have seen many dated suggestions but almost nothing after about 2007 and none of them work not even the ones specific to IE.  Either I am missing something or I still have a lot to learn both are likely.p  pObviously, I am looking for something beyond a simple text tooltip.  What I would like to do is display a small image nearby as the user moves the cursor over the various options in a select list.  Piece of cake in Firefox I can do it several ways but no other browser seems to support this.  Apparently, the other browsers do not support mouseover or hover on option tags yet, that title will appear.  There must be an event that triggers it.  Why cant it be usedp  pAny and all ideas and suggestions gratefully accepted.  Thank you.p

I found node.js with its Websocket and socket.io setup but I have not been able to get this working.p  pAll the examples and introductory information I can find starts with a chat room and gets more complicated from there. Even the chat room is beyond me because I am trying to filter out things that need human input and interfaces versus just the meat and bones of how to receive and send messages.p  pAll I need is for one app to transmit a number and the other app to receive it and react to it. I dont need chat I dont need much other than just a simple pass a variable but I cant get it to work.p  pCan someone point me to a good place to start All these tutorials about creating chat rooms assume I am serving up web pages and thats not at all my goal... I need a simpler tutorialp  pApp1 connects to server and sends a message of 1234 when the user hits a button. App2 connects and when it receives a message from the server it sets a variable to the text in the message and then responds to it.p  pIt doesnt seem like this should be so hard but I am failing miserably trying to simplify what seems to be overly complex chat room applications into a super simple basic message relay system. Both apps are running on the LocalHost on the same machine.p  pI am programming, if you want to call it that, with Construct 2 because I dont know what Im doing and I can stumble around in Construct 2 and get decent results...p  pThanksp

I was trying to eliminate it by passing an optional function and process selecting elements only when the pointer is not NULL.p  pThe problem with overloading is a lot of duplicated code, assume that someFun consists of 20 lines of code, overloading it just to add that functionality would double it.p  hr  pEdit 2 I found the solution, if someone would have a similar problem then theres explainationp  pThank you guys for the help, sorry for not making myself clear in the beginning, it probably would have saved me lots of time. But anyway  the problem was a little bit more sophisticated, the container wasnt just a mere value container but a container of keys to a dictionary from which the values could be obtained, therefore the type T is actually the type of keys. The compiler couldnt infer the Val type because it simply wasnt explicitly passed when calling the function which seems pretty obvious now....p  pThe following obviously works p  precodesomeFunltint, myClassgtsomeVector, 1, 2, 3 someFunltint, myClassgtsomeVector, 1, 2, 3, someSelector codepre  pThere is even no need to overload anything , thanks.p

Problem is with mongo db connection. When meteor tries to connect with mongo, the connection fails because meteor tries to write on mydb.system.dummy and db user doesnt have permission to do so, although db user have full readwrite access on mydb.

Negative 4088 pIn a d3 program, I have a many codecirclecode elements with data bound to them. In a callback to an event, I want to filter out most of them and place a larger red circle on top of those that are left. It looks something like thisp  precodesvg.selectAllcircle   .filter filter function not important    .appendcircle   .attrclass, extra   .attrcx, functionreturn d3.selectthis.attrcx   .attrcy, functionreturn d3.selectthis.attrcy   .attrr, 5 codepre  pAnd the result is this the first line is the original circlep  precodeltcircle cx55.41208075590415 cy279.3650793650794 r1gt   ltcircle classextra r5gtltcirclegt ltcirclegt codepre  pSo I have two problems. One, its inserting as a child of the old element, rather than a sibling. Ideally it would be inserted as the last child of codesvgcode. Second, codecxcode and codecycode arent getting copied over. What magic do I have to utter to make this workp  hr  pIf you are okay overwriting existing elements, see the answer below. To create new ones, heres how.p  precodesvg.selectAllcircle   .filter filter function not important    .eachfunctiond       svg.appendcircle          .attrclass, extra          .attrcx, function  return xd.fop           .attrcy, function  return yd.bar           .attrr, 5     codepre  pNotice two things. One, the inner functions do not take parameters, because there is no data bound to the extra circle. Use the codedcode from the existing circle instead. Two, I couldnt figure out how to access the codecxcode and codecycode of the existing circle, so I had to recompute them instead, which means the scales codexcode and codeycode must remain unchanged. Ill change the accepted answer if anyone can improve on this.p

Negative 4088 pthis is my first question here, but very often Ive been saved by this website on my programming issues. This time Im trying to do something that Im a total newbie in...p  pI need to Install PhP on a IBM iSeries i5os V6R1. I dont know much about AS400iSeries... right now I only managed to run the http server. We have never used this machine for webserving purposes, we normally use another webserver connected through an ODBC to query the iSeries tables...p  pSearching the net, Ive found the Bringing PHP to Your IBM eServer iSeries Server redpaper, but its a very old 2003 paper, its for php 4.3 and includes a patch to be able to compile Php for iseries... so i suppose that if I download a newer version of php this wont work because I dont have a patch that does the same for php 5.x...p  pThen I found information about a web that had binaries for php on iseries, i5php.net but it seems this web is no longer working... THEN... I found information about Zend, I found another IBM paper in in which they talked about installing Zend Server I dont know if by just installing that it would include Php but it seems this is not a free app anymore, or its divided now between something called Zend Framework and Zend Server...p  pAs you can see, Im a total newbie here and Im really lost... p  pIt would be great to have a step by step explanation and commands to use, but I know that would be too much to ask so if at least you could help me understand what Im getting into and give me a hint on how to get php running, I would be really grateful...p  pAnd sorry for my probably awful english.p  pThanks in advance.p
Negative 4088 pI have a desktop app that Im in the process of porting to a Django webapp. The app has some quite computationally intensive parts using numpy, scipy and pandas, among other libraries. Obviously importing the computationally intensive code into the webapp and running it isnt a great idea, as this will force the client to wait for a response. p  pTherefore, youd have to farm these tasks out to a background process that notifies the client via AJAX, I guess andor stores the results in the database when its complete. p  pYou also dont want all these tasks running in simultaneously in the case of multiple concurrent users, since that is a great way to bring your server to its knees even with a small number of concurrent requests. Ideally, you want each instance of your webapp to put its tasks into a job queue, that then automagically runs them in an optimal way based on number of cores, available memory, etc..p  pAre there any good Python libraries to help resolve this sort of an issue Are there general strategies that people use in these kinds of situations Or is this just a matter of choosing a good batch scheduler and spawning a new Python interpreter for each processp

Negative 4088 pFor updating a field called lastmodified Im trying to update this field automatically using a trigger, in stead of changing all updatestatements. The field should only be updated when a field value has changed. Problem here is that you have to maintain the triggers if a table field is added, removed or renamed. The fields are stored in rdbrelationfields, no problem. But building a query comparing the old and new value dynamically is.p  precodecreate trigger test for testtable active before update position 0 as declare variable fn char31 begin   for select rdbfieldname from rdbrelationfields where rdbrelationname  testtable into fn       do   begin     if old.fn ltgt new.fn then     begin       new.lastmodified  currenttimestamp       break     end   end end codepre  pProblem here is that old.fn and new.fn not really are comparing values, but literal strings, so the value of the fields cannot be compared. Ive seen over here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions19157376firebirdgetallmodifiedfieldsinsideatriggerFirebird  get all modified fields inside a triggera that a trigger is attached to a system table, something I dont want to. p  pIs this fullyautomated way of updating the lastmodified field not possible in this way Or do I have to create a stored procedure that deletes al triggers and then recreates them with new fields, once I perform a update on the database using this code a hrefhttpwww.firebirdfaq.orgfaq133 relnofollowhttpwww.firebirdfaq.orgfaq133a.p

Negative 4088 pIm new to MPI programming. Still dont understand few things. Using ,CC, MPICH  NT Dont ask why not MPICH2, long storyp  pSo I am solving a MPI problem where Im asked to add a string of input with several processes. suppose there are 100 inputs. strongMasterstrong processmyid0 is assigning the jobs. I have strong5 processstrong codempirun np 5 testcode  each allowed to add strong5 character at a timestrong. So master read 5 input and assigned to 4 strongslavesstrong one by one.p  precodeifmyid0      forint i  1 i lt numprocs  1 i               MPISendampread, 1, MPIINT, i, ARRSIZETAG, MPICOMMWORLD    send array size         MPISendampbuf, read, MPIINT, i, DEFAULTTAG, MPICOMMWORLD   send array          myjobs             whilemyjobs                  receive from slave and print            for example MPIRecvampreceive, 1, MPIINT, myjobs, DEFAULTTAG, MPICOMMWORLD, ampstatus            myjobs        else         slave process , Ill receive input from master, add them and send back to master  codepre  pSo this is pretty much the architecture. Now this works fine with strong20 inputsstrong. 4 slaves add and send results.p  pstrongBut Ive 100 inputstrong. So master will read next 5 input and assign to processes that are already completed first job. So I modified the portion likep  precode whilemyjobs         receive from slave and print       for example MPIRecvampreceive, 1, MPIINT, myjobs, DEFAULTTAG, MPICOMMWORLD, ampstatus       currentprocessstatus.MPISOURCE       myjobs        ifreadnext5                   MPISendampread, 1, MPIINT, i, ARRSIZETAG, MPICOMMWORLD    send array size            MPISendampbuf, read, MPIINT, i, DEFAULTTAG, MPICOMMWORLD   send array            myjobs              else                  codepre  pNow what Ive understand so far is that myid is already 4myid4 by the time it hit first receive in master process. So problem is how can I reassign a process to slavemyid1,2,3,4 to add next 5. How can I start the loop again to receive and calculate by the slaves. First 4 results are received and printed successfully by the master but then no other results came to master. I tried to print different things and saw slaves never catch the 5th input segment.p  pstrongProblemstrong How can I reassign job to myid1234 and get result in master It has to be blocking process. What Im missing Ive searched a lot. All materials point me to basic MPI. Any of them doesnt match with my kinda problem. If you know please share goof tutorial or material which will help me to understand this master slave parallelism.p

Negative 4088 pI have always wanted to learning computer programming since I was very young. I have dabbled in the past made a few full games using XNA and a few little demos using JAVA.. I always knew C was the one, it appears from what I read this is still the case   I have spent several dozen hours over many many days reading the CPPReference and guides online for C and I feel I have got to the stage where the theorylearning has run its course. But I cant dont want to make the full game myself every letter of code, so I think I will use SFML2.2.p  pMy goal at this stage is to be able to create from scratch using all my own art a 2D side scrolling space shooter. From this I will next made a scrolling fighter eg Final Fight. I want to spend as little time as possible creatingtinkering with the enginep  pMy question, is CSFML actually overkill for this above goal. Is there a more simple solution I know XNA was very simple and I am total ANNOYED that it suddenly gone  nb I work 2 fulltime jobs so it very rare I get to spend a full day doing any studying and it sometimes goes many weeks without me touching any code  sorry for the dumb question but I am REALLY hoping for some guidance towards a simpler way  or maybe just reassurance that SFMLC is a good focus. The main part pssing me off about C is the Headers thing. seems to me just doubling work for nothing  surely the PC should find way of making header itself as it just seems so productionline style repetitivenessp

The installer is getting created but innosetup automatically tries to run the installer for which admin permissions are required. Since these permissions are not given hence the installer fails.

Negative 4088 pI am in charge of a big mobilefocused web site for my company. At the beginning of the project we decided to put all the CSS code into a single .css file and load it within codeltheadgtcode.p  precodeltheadgt    ltlink relstylesheet typetextcss hrefstyles.cssgt ltheadgt codepre  pSame with JavaScriptcode but we load at the bottom of codeltbodygtcode.p  precode   ltscript srcscripts.jsgtltscriptgt ltbodygt codepre  pI always believed that this is a simple and well maintainable approach and once the files are loaded, theyre in the browsers cache for the rest of the time the visitor surfs across the sites. However, after maintaining the site for a while now the amount of CSS and JS transferred became more and more so my supervisor complained that were loading to much CSS and JS during initial page load. He wants to reduce traffic in order to improve page loading speed and reduce traffic costs.p  pNow, for the JavaScript part I am pretty confident that we can refactor our code by using requireJS and only load the JS modules that we need during runtime. So far, so good.p  pNow I am asking myself what to do with our giant CSS file which blocks initial rendering of the site because its referenced in codeltheadgtcode. What would be a good practice to reduce the amount of css Its already minified and gzip compressed.p  pMy first thought was to split the css into a base.css file which contains styles that are required on all sites like header, navigation, footer and so on... and another additional sitespecific file lets call is site.css which contains all the other styles that are required just for the currently viewed site. This way we could reduce overhead by loading only the styles needed. After thinking about it for a while I pretty quickly realized that this would be difficult and probably not that much more efficient as I hoped.p  pThen I thought, what if it would be possible to put each set of css styles into its own file lets say 1 file for each GUI component and then define dependencies between HTML components and the styles that are required to render, similar to the RequireJS approach. Then, theoretically, we would be able to only load the css files needed during runtime.p  pWould this be possible If yes, how Is there a library that does the job If no, whats a good alternate solution for reducing the CSS file sizep

The problem is about the drawable codeseekbarbgfullcode  its a 9patch png. And all need is to obtain a not NinePatchDrawablelinked resulting Bitmap. Assume I have a 460x30px view with 9patch image set as src or background and the 9patch image is stretched just like it should to. So I need to get a Bitmap this view contains and this Bitmap should not be linked somehow to a 9patch.

Negative 4088 pMy question is Why would an SQL server have a low amount of memory allocated to Plan Cache  And, if a correction is needed, what might be done to correct thisp  pWe have an SQL server with an issue of Compilations per second being high indicating not enough of the execution plans are cached for use first detected when we ran spAskBrent ExpertMode1, Seconds30 [from brentozar.comaskbrent].p  pWe have run the SQL Live Monitor application a hrefhttpssqlmonitor.codeplex.com relnofollowhttpssqlmonitor.codeplex.coma on the server and the Plan Cache results show a very low amount of memory 355.27 MB allocated to caching execution plans and therefore a low Plan Cache Hit Ratio varying between 5 and 50 percent.p  pMy research shows that memory allocated to Plan Cache is not a configurable amount, but a calculation based on the memory allocated to the SQL instance.  So, for this server, which has 48GB total and 40GB allocated to SQL, the calculation of .75  4GB  .1  36GB should allocate 6.6GB for Plan Cache.  Did I calculate correctlyp  pOf note, this server has only one production database and that database is 50GB in size.  We have Optimize for Ad hoc Workloads set to True and just set Parameterization at the database level to Forced. Compared to another SQL server that has 32GB total and 26GB allocated the Plan Cache numbers look more reasonable 4GB in size and a Hit Ratio of above 80 percent.p  pAlso, running the script below against both SQL servers consistently shows the problem server having a hit percentage in the mid 70 range and the other server showing a hit percentage in the high 90 range.p  precodeWITH    cte1            AS  SELECT [dopc].[objectname] ,                      [dopc].[instancename] ,                      [dopc].[countername] ,                      [dopc].[cntrvalue] ,                      [dopc].[cntrtype] ,                      ROWNUMBER OVER  PARTITION BY [dopc].[objectname], [dopc].[instancename] ORDER BY [dopc].[countername]  AS rn                  FROM [sys].[dmosperformancecounters] AS dopc                  WHERE [dopc].[countername] LIKE Cache Hit Ratio                      AND  [dopc].[objectname] LIKE Plan Cache                            OR [dopc].[objectname] LIKE Buffer Cache                                                AND [dopc].[instancename] LIKE Total                     SELECT CONVERTDECIMAL16, 2,  [c].[cntrvalue]  1.0  [c1].[cntrvalue]   100.0 AS [hitpct]          FROM [cte1] AS c               INNER JOIN [cte1] AS c1                  ON c.[objectname]  c1.[objectname]                     AND c.[instancename]  c1.[instancename]          WHERE [c].[rn]  1              AND [c1].[rn]  2 codepre

Negative 4088 pMy application Win Phone 8.1, C assumes a workflow during which user may want to change certain metadata of previously recorded video rotation. The use case is as followsp  ol liUser shots video using e.g. Lumia Camerali liUser opens my applicationli liUser selects video file .mp4 using open file picker and adjusts settingsli liUser clicks Save and the metadata is updated in original fileli ol  pAfter file is changed, OneDrive and Windows Media Player PC both see the change. Even if I copy a file from phone to PC and then back to phone with different name  phone sees the change. However the emoriginalem file is treated by phone as if no change was applied, even after reboot i.e. the video is rotated incorrectly on thumbnail and preview used by Photos app Videos app just ignores that. strongLooks like theres some cache to invalidate.strong Any guess which one and how top

xsdate20150520code and later the part of codeQuestion1Answer2code in the OR operator, when codeQuestion1code has selected the codeAnswer2code, Question4 is not shown. That means that the right part of the OR operator is ignored. But if I change the relevant rule as code Question1Answer2 or xsdateQuestion2 ampgt xsdate20150520code the behaviour works perfect in both cases Question4 is shown if Question1  answer or the date field has a correct value.p  pSeems that having the date at the first place is giving me some problems. Probably because if Question3 is not fill up due to the flow, strongdate has an empty value and the relevant rule is not run correctlystrong. p  pI have tried also some alternatives as checking the length of the field adding codestringlengthformatdateQuestion3, [MNn,3][D01][Y] gt 0code or codeifnotnormalizespaceQuestion2   then  xsdateQuestion2 ampgt xsdate20150520 else falsecode both with the scope of ignoring the processing of the date field operator if it is empty. But no luck at all. p  pWith other different types of date, the relevant rule works normally, and therefore I think that the issue is with my date field. p  pIf this is the expected behaviour, the question is How can I use the date field in a correct way to have a relevant rule working correctlyp

Negative 4088 pWe are currently implementing a shinobi chart but for some reason the panGesture that is associated set to the shinobi chart SChartGesturePanTypePanPinch doesnt recognize any pan gestures to the left ie. that would move the chart forward on the xAxis. I checked in sChartDidStartPanning and sChartIsPanning and neither are called when the gesture is the to left but work perfectly fine when they are to the right. p  pSo for now, if I want to perform a left panGesture I must first perform a right panGesture and then before lifting my finger, move to the opposite direction.p  pThe code for the chart is fairly substantial and broken up so I dont know what I would include here specifically, however I can answer questions if required. Are there any areas that could be causing this behaviour to occur I have these set up too for the xAxisp  precodexAxis.enableGesturePanning  YES xAxis.allowPanningOutOfMaxRange  YES xAxis.allowPanningOutOfDefaultRange  YES codepre  pWhyhow would it be disabled for one direction onlyp  pEDIT Something interested I just found was if you keep doing a left gesture over and over again it will sporadically work and sometimes recognize it. This however makes me even more confused.p

After I debugged and hooked into WordPress coderedirectcanonicalcode, it shows nothing related to codesomepage.code. Instead it only shows that it is redirecting codehttpsexample.comindex.phpcode to codehttpsexample.comcode.

It all works fine, but for some reason the one where codesomepage.code should be redirected to nonHTTPS, the server value codeHTTPScode is codeoffcode on all rewrite attempts even when loading the page with HTTPS, essentially making the rule useless. If I remove the HTTPS check, I get a rewrite loop from HTTPS to HTTP and so on when on codesomepage.code URLs..p  pSame result with codeSERVERPORTcode rewrite conditional.

Negative 4088 pIm newbie in Android. I am using a webview to load some MathML content. I want to make the webview act like a button, so that I can put three or four webviews and the user can select one of them by clicking on it. I want to make  the  webview as a whole, clickable, like a button. My idea is to put a transparent button over the webview, so that the user can still view the content in the webview and when he tries to click the webview, it would actually trigger the OnClickListener of the transparent button on top of the webview. Once the webview finishes loading with the content, I am getting the dimensions of the webview and setting the button on top with the same dimensions.p  pMy problem is that the webview is always getting displayed on top of the button.

Next, I tried importing the codeMessageWebApplicationInitializer.javacode and codeRootConfiguration.javacode classes from the codemessagesjccode sample mentioned in the Verify SecurityConfig is loaded section, but this caused a failure of the app to get launched when tomcat was restarted, with errors about beans of specific names not being resolved.  p  p4. So I started importing the classes for each of the named beans from the codemessagesjccode project and resolving one error after another, but the number of these tells me that the author could not possibly have meant for readers to manually import so many classes that are not described in the tutorial.p  pstrongCan someone please give simple instructions for getting the tutorial in the link above to workstrongp  pI really just want to add a custom login form, but I have to start with something simpler and build up with a tutorial.  p  pA major problem with the spring example projects is that they are rarely selfcontained, so that a project never contains all the required code.

In my controller I set it to only take 10 records codeiDisplayLengthcodep  precode        var displayedProviders  filteredProviders             .Skipparam.iDisplayStart             .Takeparam.iDisplayLength codepre  pSo when I first navigate to the page with the table or I use pagination it should only load 10 records at a time. p  pCan anyone guide me to why the first load is taking such a long time My fear is that its loading the entire table into the Json Request which is slowing it down at first. This wasnt what I had in mind when implementing server side processing.
