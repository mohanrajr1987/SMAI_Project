Positive 87 pI need to come up with a form in SSRS 2008 that prints labels based on information stored in a table or tables. So far I have been unsuccessful in my online searching. How do I tell SSRS that I want the KitOrder.QuantityCommitted quantity of labels to print for each item each item has its own quantity I will likely be printing labels for 2030 items at a time. In case its helpful to know, there are 18 blank labels per sheet.p  pedited 100115 Sorry, I played around with with the example you gave and wasnt able to get my report to work. I am not an expert with SSRS.  I have 2 tables I am using to get the info I need for the labels and only need the columns listed below the table names at this point.p  precodeKitOrder        INNER JOIN      Item KitOrderNumber                ItemNumber Quantity                      ItemDescription codepre  pI am using KitOrderNumber from a dropdown box  INKitOrderNumber  as my Parameter. The ItemNumber and ItemDescription print on the label. Would there be some custom code I could use that would return 3 labels when KitOrder.Quantity  3 instead of just 1 labelp

Positive 87 pI am currently developing an a Windows Form application that will print to a Zebra Printer. Using a barcode scanner for input, the application receives a unique identifier and then pings our database to gather information pertaining to the identifier. p  pThe current setup includes a barcode scanner connected via USB to a PC. A Zebra ZT410 Printer on the network via wired connection. PC on the network via wireless connection. p  pThe PC is running the Windows Form Application. When a barcode is scanned, the application queries a database, returns pertinent information, and then sends ZPL to the printer containing the information to be printed. It works perfectly.p  pThe current hurdle we are trying to overcome is completing this process without the need for a PC intermediary. The scanner plugs directly into the printer but Im unaware of how to read scans from the scanner through the printer and ultimately over the network and into the application. Is this possible If so, how might I go about itp  pI didnt include any code because I didnt believe it was needed but I can provide what I have if necessary.p  pThanks.p

Positive 87 pI have an application where I will need to print labels from the browser. I have done this before when printing a sheet of labels i.e. Avery 5160. This is fairly straightforward as it just requires a combination of html and css and your content and you can print the page from a normal 8.5x11 printer.p  pMy dilemma, however, is that I need to print labels from a label printer, the kind where it prints one at a time from a roll. The specific model that will be used is a Brother QL500. The part I am struggling with is that the number of labels to be printed will not always be the same. It could be 1, could be 4, could be 15. How can I style a page where the printer will know that each label needs to be printed individually, rather than just printing out all of the content on one long label. Does anyone know if this is actually possible  has done this before successfullyp

Negative 87 pSuppose someone worked for a company that put up an HTTP proxy preventing internet access without password authentication NTLM, I think. Also suppose that this password rotated on a daily basis, which added very little security, but mostly served to annoy the employees. How would one get started writing a Firefox addon that automatically entered these rotating passwordsp  pemTo clarify This addon would not just submit the password the addon would programmatically generate it with some knowledge of the password rotation scheme.emp
Negative 87 pWe have project PrjDb.dll in vb 6.0 that has a reference to ado 2.5. The project is built on Machine A. Now when we generate an interop for PrjDb.dll on another machine B, we end up with a new ADODB.dll with ver 2.5 in version field instead of linking it with the Primary Interop Assembly adodb.dll  found under Program FilesMicrosoft.NETPrimary Interop Assemblies. The problem is that when i deploy my application, it now asks for this newly generated adodb.dll. And i dont want to ship it.p  pEven if I provide the adodb.dll path in the command line, it still generates the new interop for AdoDB. I tried using the switch strict then it says the it can not resolve references using the AdoDB.dll that i want it to use. p  pThis doesnt happen if we generate interop on the same machine where we built PrjDb.dll. Rather on any machine other than machine B, it automatically picks the PIA for AdoDB.p  pAny idea whats going on machine B when we generate the interop for PrjDb.dllp
Negative 87 pGoogle results on this one are a bit thin, but suggest that it is not easily possible.p  pMy specific problem is that I need to renumber the IDs in two tables that are related to each other such that table B has an tableaid column in it. I cant renumber table A first because then its children in B point to the old IDs. I cant renumber table B first because then they would point to the new IDs before they were created. Now repeat for three or four tables.p  pI dont really want to have to fiddle around with individual relationships when I could just start transaction disable ref integrity sort IDs out reenable ref integrity commit transaction.

Negative 87 pI am using the Windows Update API to update a bunch of VMs. With Windows Update comes the inevitable reboots. Can anyone think of a way that I could tell from a remote server if the windows box has indeed finished its reboot All ideas or thoughts would appreciated.p  pEDIT Because the VMs are in Lab Manager and using a fenced configuration, WMI will not work, and although I thought about using the VM to send a signal when it was back up. There would have been no way to reliably know who to notify as the app waiting for the machine could be on any number of machines so it just didnt seem reasonable. However time is not essential and even though I know this will bite me sometime when a Service Pack comes down I have had good success with the PING and then wait 5 minutes so far, so I am going to use that for now. If I run into exceptions I will then try to implement the VM notfiying the world when it comes back up. Thanks to all.p

Negative 87 pIm writing applications that interoperate with a thirdparty application.  This application exposes an API to developers via methods in a DLL.  Some time ago, the vendor of this app started integrating their own .NET components into their program, and when they did, they decided that their components should use the codeConfigurationManagercode to get settings at runtime.p  pWhat this means  their program, codefoo.execode, calls codefooengine.dllcode, and it reads its settings from codefoo.exe.configcode.  My program, codebar.execode, also calls codefooengine.dllcode, and it reads its settings from codebar.exe.configcode.p  pWell, thats just plain wrong.  But how do I fix itp  pThe simple workaround is to replicate codefoo.exe.configcodes settings in codebar.exe.configcode.  Thatll work, but its emstupidem.  It means that from an administrative standpoint, a given setting has to be maintained in N different files.  Thats going to fail sooner or later.p  pI tried putting a codeconfigSourcecode attribute on the codeappSettingscode section in my config file.  As it happens, Im using the codeapplicationSettingscode section for my settings, and theyre using the codeappSettingscode section for theirs, so I can live with simply getting that section from a different file.

Work can be done on the object and this builds up the object to be expensive to copy.  The work to build up the data is not exactly trivial either.  Currently, I will pass this object into a function that will modify the state of the object.  This to me is preferable to newing the object internal to the worker function and returning it back, as it allows me to keep things on the stack.p  precodeclass ExpensiveCopy Defines some interface I cant change.  public     ExpensiveCopyconst ExpensiveCopy toCopy Ouch This hurts.

Negative 87 pIn IPv6 networking, the IPV6V6ONLY flag is used to ensure that a socket will only use IPv6, and in particular that IPv4toIPv6 mapping wont be used for that socket.  On many OSs, the IPV6V6ONLY is not set by default, but on some OSs e.g. Windows 7, it is set by default.p  pMy question is  What was the motivation for introducing this flag  Is there something about IPv4toIPv6 mapping that was causing problems, and thus people needed a way to disable it  It would seem to me that if someone didnt want to use IPv4toIPv6 mapping, they could simply not specify a IPv4mapped IPv6 address.

Negative 87 pI would like to remove the resizing border from my WPF custom window. I already found that I have to handle the WMNCCALCSIZE message and return 0. That removes the border and aligns the window to the top left corner of the window. The problem is that by doing so, the client area increases and the WPF root control doesnt. That creates black edges on the left and bottom sides of the window that I would like to get rid of.p  pIm using VS2010 C Windows XP and would like this to work under both Windows XP and Windows 7.p  pThanks in Advance.p  pEDIT I found out what is causing the black edges, they are the window behind. Now it seems that the problem is with the root element of the window not occupying the whole window. When I set its margin to negative values it draws over the black area. Apparently the layout pass is ok and the desired size is the same as the window but the render size is different.p  pI also found out that the whole problem could be solved by removing WSTHICKFRAME from the window style. The problem with that is the resizing functionality that is enabled only when WSTHICKFRAME is used. Im using WMNCHITTEST to do the resizing and if the window knows it doesnt have a resizing border, it will shutdown its resizing functionality.p  pI would like to make the root element occupy the whole window to eliminate the black window background or alternatively enable the native resizing functionality without the thick frame.p  pThanks.p

Negative 87 pSometimes Id like to know the reasoning of certain API changes. Since Google hasnt helped me with this question, maybe StackOverflow can. Why did Microsoft choose to remove the codeGetAttributecode helper method on XML elements In the codeSystem.Xmlcode world there was codeXmlElement.GetAttributexcode like codegetAttributecode in MSXML before it, both of which return either the attribute value or an empty string when missing. With codeXElementcode theres codeSetAttributeValuecode but codeGetAttributeValuecode wasnt implemented.p  pCertainly its not too much work to modify logic to test and use the codeXElement.Attributex.Valuecode property but its not as convenient and providing the utility function one way codeSetAttributeValuecode but not the other seems weird. Does anyone out there know the reasons behind the decision so that I can rest easily and maybe learn something from itp

Negative 87 pOk, so heres my problem. I have several SWFs pulled in at runtime from different domains were using a CDN. There are some shared fonts within the SWFs.p  pIm trying to minimize file sizes as much as possible, so that means either not embedding the fonts in any of those SWFs and setting all their TextFormats at runtime. Thats very impractical, and it would be easy to miss some of them.p  pThe other, better option is to use runtime shared libraries to pull in the fonts, but that requires either an absolute URL goes against the concept of using a CDN, or a relative URL defeats the purpose of using RSLs in the first place since those resources would be downloaded several times anyway. p  pIdeally id like to be able to tell each SWF at runtime where to pull in the fonts, and give them all the same, dynamic URL.p  pI cant find anyone whos encountered a similar situation, so im not sure if this can or cant be done, but most AS3 problems i find are solved here, so im hoping someone knows a good solution for this.p  pOr is there a 3rd option im not consideringp

Negative 87 pIm trying to create a C serial port class for a project that im working on. Unfortunately Im stuck. I need the user to be able to specify if the port read function is blocking or nonblocking. So when the user creates a port object they specify a flags variable.

However when run from the code I get back all of the items in the database, even those which fall outside the date range I am searching for.p  pI was wondering if the issue was because the parameter names are the same as the column names in the table, so I changed the parameter names codeStartDatecode and codeEndDatecode to be codeFromDatecode and codeToDatecode and this fixed the problem, if the parameter names are different I get the right result set back. This concerns me because in the project that I am working on this pattern is duplicated all over the place.

Negative 87 pIm diving into iOS development and I created a universal app that turned into an iPhoneonly app.  When it runs on the iPad, it just loads a white screen since theres no iPad code written yet.

I have the Targeted Device Family property set to iPhone, so that should prevent it from showing up in the App Store as an iPad app, but if anyone owns both an iPad and an iPhone, then the app could end up synced to the iPad, at which point it will just load the white screen because it will try to run the app in iPad mode, which it doesnt have any code to support.

Negative 87 pJust wondering, is there an easier way to remove control objects completely from a project p  pLets say I put a button on a form and write some code to make the button do something. A few days later I decide I dont want this button anymore. I would just click delete on the form designer, but it leaves the variable name and onclick function in the .h and .cpp files when programming in C or the onclick method in C. I would then have to go and find all traces of the button and delete the code manually. I want to know if there is a oneclick solution for removing the button like the oneclick method for creating well, its not exactly one click to generate the variable and method, but its not having to visit more than one different place to make it work either.p

Negative 87 pGood morning everyone,p  pI currently have a robot with some sensors, like a GPS, an accelerometer and a compass. The thing I would like to do is my robot to reach a GPS coordinate that I enter. I wondered if any algorithm to do that already existed. I dont want a source code, which wouldnt have any point, just the procedure to follow for my robot to do so, for me to be able to understand what I do... At the moment, lets imagine that I can access the GPS coordinate everytime, so no need of a Kalman filter. I know its unrealistic, but I would like to programm it step by step, and Kalman is the next step.p  pIf anyone has an idea...p  pHave a nice dayp  pThank youp

Negative 87 pI am having great success getting the look I want using a custom header view and the delegate method tableView viewForHeaderInSection.

It gets called multiple times when a new section is added, even for the other sections although I may have some control over that, and Im going to look into it.p  pI am wondering if there is something like tableViewdequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier that can manage section header views, or a way to know when a section header view is in need of a release. I am not sure if the autorelease is sufficient to avoid a leak.p  pAt the same time, my understanding is that creating cells is costly, and thats why they get reused with the dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier process. I have to imagine this would be the same with section headers. p  pWould anyone who has come across this issue before commentp

Negative 87 pI have searched for answers until I have become crossedeyed and confused.p  pI have a Windows XP environment with Visual Studios 2010. I have downloaded and extracted CppUnit 1.12.1 from Sourceforge to CCppUnit. I understand I must use Visual Studio to open srcCppUnitLibraries.dsw and Batch Build all of the projects it opens to populate the lib directory with libraries. This is essentially the extent of the CppUnit installation process.p  pHowever when I try to open CppUnitLibraries.dsw, Visual Studio says the project must be converted to the current Visual C project format. If I click yes to convert and open the project, it says the project file cannot be loaded and it asks if I want to remove the unloadable project from the solution, to which I say No since Im certain this is not what I want to have happen. It does this for many projects in the CppUnitLibraries.dsw solution and Im assuming this is unwanted behavior.p  pA few of my search results indicated that I should open srcmsvc6testrunnerMsDevCallerListCtrl.cpp, find the line that says...p  pcodeimport libid80cc9f66e7d84ddd85b6d9e6cd0e93e2 version7.0 lcid0 rawinterfacesonly namedguidscodep  p...and replace the 7.0 with 10.0. But this does not help.p  pAm I doing something wrong What must I do to get started with CppUnit Im sorry if this is a very noobish question. Im stuck, frustrated, and very confused.p

Negative 87 phave created a dynamic python file pyd using VC. Using cxfreeze, I have created an exe. In order for this program to work on other computers, I need to have a file msvcr100.dll in the applications folder.

The sub folder should be named Microsoft.VC100.CRT. I have tried playing around with the settings in MS VC by changing the project properties.

Negative 87 pHello I have an android application. In my app I have a SQLite database stored on the device that should be synchronized with a MySQL database stored on the server.p  pNow I have to retrieve a list of IDs. I can do it querying the SQLite database or the MySQL database. I chose to use the SQLite database because itd be much faster and easier considering what I have to do. But now I was thinking about it and I have a question emAre the android SQLite database files safeem I mean is there a possibility that someone access these files and modify information inside them or are they hidden to usersp  pBecause if I ask information from the server Im sure that it is safe, instead I dont know the security level of android databases.p  pLets suppose that each ID corresponds to an application ID I paid for for example application 3 and 5. When I find a way to modify the android database and so adding also application 7 and 8 it would seem to the device that Ive paid also for these applications instead I didnt and I cant use them. Thats why I was thinking to query the MySQL database, because the user cant modify it, but this way its gonna be slower. What do you thinkp

However, new points wont be inserted anymore after the initial filling of the data structure.pli lipThe strongquery triangles are already knownstrong when the rasterized edges arrive.pli lipThere are strongmore query triangles than data edgesstrong.pli ul  pThere are many a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiSpatialindexSpatialIndex relnofollowspatial data structuresa available. However Im wondering, which one is the best one for my problem. Im willing to implement a highly optimized data structure to solve this problem, as it will be a core element of the project. Therefore, also mixes or abbreviations of data structures are welcomep  ul lipa hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiHilbertRtree relnofollowRtreesa seem to be the best data structure which I found for this problem until now as they provide support for rectanglebased queries. I would check for all white pixels within an AABB of the query triangle, then would check for each returned pixel if it lies within the query rectangle.p  pHowever, Im not sure how well Rtrees will behave since edgebased data will not be easily groupable into rectangles, as the points are clumped together on narrow lines and not pread out.p  pIm alo not sure if it would make sense to prebuild the structure of the Rtree using information about the query triangles which will be made as soon as the structure is filled as mentioned before, the query triangles are already known when the data arrives.pli lipReversing the problem seems also to be a valid solution, where I use a a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiSegmenttreeGeneralizationforhigherdimensions relnofollow2dimensional intervala tree to get for each white pixel a list of all triangles which contain it. Then, it can already be stored within all those result sets and be returned instantly when the query arrives. However, Im not sure how this performs a the number of triangles is higher than the number of edges, but still lower than the number of white pixels as an edge is mostly split up into 2050 pixels.pli lipA data structure which would exploit that white pixels have most often white pixels as neighbors would seem to be most efficient. However, I could not find anything about such a thing until now.pli ul
Negative 87 pI have been working around extracting the time series from shapes based on distances to center of mass clockwise starting from angle 0 to 360.p  pMy Implementation that arranges contour points based on their angle to the  [1,0], vector might be good for some shapes but is not useful for shapes that has much articulation.

When i try to make them required the EF does not generate the database.p  pCan someone tell me what is wrong with my model that it is causing the EF to not create a required relationsship between Client amp Inruiry  Is this due to cascade delete  As I read some where the mssql can only have one cascade delete path between Client, Product and Inquiry.

The request had 0.0.0.03000getjson1 whereas the requesting URL was localhost3000getjson1.  Very hard to spot and the lack of return  status info with getJSON made it more difficult.

Only integral seconds are stored in the   java.util.Date component. The fractional seconds  the nanos  are   separate. The Timestamp.equalsObject method never returns true when   passed a value of type java.util.Date because the nanos component of a   date is unknown. As a result, the Timestamp.equalsObject method is   not symmetric with respect to the java.util.Date.equalsObject   method. Also, the hashcode method uses the underlying java.util.Date   implementation and therefore does not include nanos in its   computation.p      pDue to the differences between the Timestamp class and the   java.util.Date class mentioned above, it is recommended that code not   view Timestamp values generically as an instance of java.util.Date.

Negative 87 pI have a process wherein a program running in an application server must access a table in an Oracle database server whenever at least one row exists in this table. Each row of data relates to a client requesting some number crunching performed by the program. The program can only perform this number crunching serially that is, for one client at a time rather than multiple clients in parallel.p  pThus, the program needs to be informed of when data is available in the database for it to process. I could eitherp  ol lihave the program poll the database, or li lihave the database trigger the program. li ol  pQUESTION 1 Is there any conventional wisdom why one approach might be better than the other p  pQUESTION 2 I wonder if programs have any issues running for months at a time would any processes in the server stop or disrupt the program from running  if so I dont know how Id learn there was a problem unless from angry customers.

Negative 87 pI am trying to think of a good way to define baseitems for a small game I am creating in C using DirectX. Right now the structure would look something likep  precodestruct itemdef      string name     ID3DXMesh mesh     vectorltIDirect3DTexture9gt textures     vectorltshortgt abilities  codepre  pThe problem I am having is I essentially want to make an array of these base properties without creating an upper limit for textures or abilities.p  pEssentially imagine it as having another array of itemdefp  precodevectorltitemdefgt itemDefs codepre  pand then wanting to add items to this array, either hardcoded or from a filep  precodeitemDefs.pushbackNewItemWall, Assets.GetMeshMeshWall, ,  codepre  pBasically, I have no idea how to put multiple single items into a parameter list for a vector array. The second problem being the need to create two lists in one set of arguments.p  pSo my question is What should replace the  fields in that statement above Or, failing that, what embetterem method should I use to store these basic definitionsp  pfor clarity Pointers for textures are obtained virtually the same way as the mesh above was and the abilities are just short ints. Although it should be noted that for these definitions both meshes and textures could just be replaced with their enumerations rather than pointersp

If you refresh the app pool the web app will no longer be in list of apps asociated to that pool.  p  pIf someone decides to delete the web application through the file system, IIS isnt able to update the metabase, so now you cant see the web app in the default web site, but it still appears under the app pool.  Is there any way to refresh the metabase to remove old configuration that is orphanedp
Negative 87 pI have created a simple webpage that launches a widget after a button is pressed.  The button press adds an element to the DOM treep  precodevar div  document.getElementByIdloginWidget var loginWidget  document.createElementscript loginWidget.setAttributetype, textjavascript loginWidget.setAttributesrc, httpwidgetstore.etc.etc  div.appendChildloginWidget codepre  pThis launches the login widget in the webpage.  How do I get it to open in a new window preferably resized to the size of the widget  If I do it like this will my original window be able to access values from the login widget  If this is a bad idea whats the best way to style the widget so it stands out more from the original size.p  pForgive my n00bness.

Negative 87 pIm currently working on a Twitter app for Windows Phone, in which  via a custom codeDependencyPropertycode  the codeXamlcode property of each a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.controls.richtextbox28vvs.9529.aspx relnofollowcodeRichTextBoxcodea is bound to the text of a tweet which includes programmatically generated codeRuncode elements with all the text. This works good enough until there are curly braces codecode and codecode in the text. I tried replacing them with codeamp123code and escaping with codecode but to no avail.p  pThe weird thing is, if the curly braces show up in the middle of the text more specifically, in the codeTextcode property of a codeRuncode element everythings fine, its only when an opening curly brace is at the beginning emorem a closing curly brace is at the end that the codeRichTextBoxcode crashes. I was able to work around this by inserting zerowidth spaces with codeamp8203code at the beginning and end of each codeRuncode.p  pHowever, this issue gets more complicated if there is both an opening curly brace at the beginning emandem a closing curly brace at the end. In that case, the zerowidth spaces dont seem to work anymore, so the only workaround would be to insert additional real characters at either the beginning or end of the text, which I obviously cant do.p  pThis does seem to be a bug with codeRichTextBoxcode, as acknowledged in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2999782silverlight4richtextboxcantrestorexamlwithtextcontainingcurlybraces29998642999864this answera over two years ago. Apparently, it hasnt been fixed yet. So, does anyone know of any further workarounds I could tryp  p can also be preceeded only by whitespace or followed only by whitespacep

Negative 87 pI have written some c 3.5 batch processing code that can optionally override the thread pool maxthreads. It uses some pretty heavy resources that are not threadsafe, requiring a resource pool to be maintained with an item for each active thread. The consuming application can set a limit on how many threads the batch processor will use, which in turn calls codeThreadPool.SetMaxThreadscode. Im doing this to test if manually setting a limit averages better performance than leaving it at the default setting.p  pMy question is, should I reset the maxthreads back to the previous value for the application after each use of the batch processing code It will be called intermittently throughout the day, possibly thousands of times. Will the MaxThreads limit persist forever until the application is restarted  it is set to a different value, or will it automatically reset p  pWhile this isnt really a concern in my test harness, Im wondering if I should update the code to reset the threadpool when the other resources are disposed after a batch completes for use in a production environment. Are there any implications to just leaving it overriddenp  pFinally, does setting the threadpool in one .net application set it for ALL applications on the box, or only for the context of that single appp

How could I Skip over this second Item in the Main Array, so that the second .each Function continues to parse the Main Array until the end of the JSON Message.p  precodeFunction  .eachresponse.friends.data, functioni, friend     .eachfriend.statuses, functionj, status         alertstatus.message          JSON Message          id idValue,     friends        data [                  name NameValue,          id idValue,          statuses             data [                              message Msg1,                updatedtime Date,              ,                              message Msg2,                updatedtime Date,              ,            ],                   ,                   name NameValue,          id idValue,                           name NameValue,          id idValue,          statuses             data [                              message Msg1,                updatedtime Date,              ,                          message Msg2,                updatedtime Date,              ,            ],                        ],         codepre

Negative 87 pi need a conversion code on c to convert ASCII to Binary..p  pIm doing a project on serial port and  i need to display the received data in hex.. i have declared the received data as string. I used this codep  precodepublic static byte[] ConvertToBinarystring Rxstring                      System.Text.ASCIIEncoding encoding  new System.Text.ASCIIEncoding             return encoding.GetBytesRxstring          codepre  pps Rxstring is the string variable that i declared for received data.p  pAnd when on the serial port testing, when i send  for eg 41  and my display must also be displaying 41.

Negative 87 pI run Haar training in openCV 2.4.3.p  ol liI have 10 negative images and about 30 positive I know that it is small amount.li lipositive samples are organized in vec file and negative background  images are described by text file which stores the paths of the images. li liWith such a small amount of images a perfect solution exists all of the background images classified as false and the real samples as true. li ol  pWhen this perfect solution found, openCV enters an infinite loop inside codeicvGetHaarTrainingDatacode function.p  pIt wants to find background images on which the cascade fails but there are no more such images so this function is stuck in codeforcode loop forever.p  pcodeicvGetBackgroundImagecode function, called in this loop, just keeps loading the same images from harddisk which are rejected by the cascade.p  pDoes someone know of a patch, or a bug fix I can apply to solve this problemp  pOne possible fix, I came up with, is to let codeicvGetBackgroundImagecode load each file only once since if it was rejected by the cascade once it would be rejected always. But this is a wrong tweak since this same function is used for generating vec files in codecvCreateSamplescode and in this scenario we do want it to load the same file few times.p  pSecond possible fix  use negative examples in vec file like positive examples instead of info path format. This is a way to overcome infinite loop by not activating the problematic callback, but the result is an openCV error that causes a crash. It happens when negative vec file reaches EOF. p  pMeanwhile I solved those 2 bugs infinite loop and crash by changing directly the source code of openCV and recompiling the binaries. I will submit my changes to openCV committee soon. But I cant believe that I am the only one who bumped into such problem...p

Luckily it provides clients to detect, download and setup the related prerequisite components.   p  pMy question is I started to develop this app with .NET 4.0 and then upgraded it to .NET 4.5 now on the prerequisites list both 4.5 and 4 is checked. i am wondering if i uncheck the .NET 4.0 component would it be alright p  pdoes .NET 4.5 include .NET 4.0p
Negative 87 pI am building a PHP shopping cart that pulls the item info and price from a mySQL database. This is actually functioning perfectly. The issue is I now need to add the functionality of adding an item to the cart using form data, instead of from the database. The reason I need to do this is that it is a buildyourown kind of thing with multiple options. So I created a form with radio buttons. I have successfully accomplished being able to add items from the db as well as add multiple version of the form supplied purchase. My only problem comes to the total price. I am getting strange results on the total. If I add multiple items from the db, the total calculates perfectly. If I add multiple items from the form, the total calculates perfectly. If I mix the two, strange things happen. Ive only been coding PHP for 5 months or so, so still pretty new. Have searched forums and YouTube repeatedly with no luck.

Negative 87 pIm designing a small app which would have a couple of independent pages. Im planning to use angular for the front end and I need an SQL database on the backend.p  pIm not really designing a web application, but a inhouse systeme, using cheap mobile phone for operators tasks a kind of todo list for each operator and supervisor page on a desktop which is used to assigned tasks to operators.br There is at the moment 3 different pages 1 the mobile todo list 2 the administrator scheduling page  3 administrator report and stats.p  pOnly the first one needs angular, the 2 other could be done as a standard web app, but Ill prefer to use angular if possible.p  pIm thinking of either using Rails only because I know it to readwrite from the database and exportimport json to the angular pages. However it doesnt solve the problem of how to do a multiple pages angular application   All the pages even though different angular views will probably share the same components. I would like to avoid using angular routing because Im using cheap and slow mobile for the todolike, so I dont want it to be overloaded with things it doesnt need.p  h2Updateh2  pIm also using yeoman, not sure is the best choice as it seems to manage single page application.  Maybe I need to have one yeoman project per view p  pSo what is the best practice to have a rail application to host different angular pages p  pAlso if there is an easier way to serve sql directly to angular, I can use something different that rail. p

Negative 87 pI have a project under test in Jenkins test installation it does some regression tests ti verify that the installer works.  This project has a soft dependency on stuff outside of Jenkins control if the latest installer isnt available, then we cant test it.  We can always retest an old installer, though, and that seems worth doing weve got the CPU cycles, so we may as well burn em.p  pWhat Id like is produce a loud warning if the installer isnt current, but then continue with the tests.p  pThe first thing I tried was making a test that failed when the installer was out of date.  That was prominent, but confusing because the installation tests werent actually the thing that was failing.  p  pNow I have the same test, but it uses a JUnit assumption instead of an assertion, which means that the test either skips or passes.  This is also lessthanperfect, because Jenkins reports 9 tests, 0 failures on the front page, and its only when I drill down multiple layers into the test results that I see that 1 of the 9 tests was skipped.p  pCan I get Jenkins to report skipped tests on the front page  I didnt find an appropriatelooking plugin for it.  Is there a better method I should use to warn about the installer being out of datep

I got this code running in R, and I was trying to literally translate this from R to Python.p  pI want to approximate the value for Theta when the grensscore equals 50.  I have a starting value of theta  0.5, and then it iterates through in R. It only takes around 11 iterations in R to get to the point.p  pSadfully, this is not working in Python, and I isolated it this much for some reason the values can only go below the 0.5, but they cannot go above. Using a print at those places even shows that it is not running the codeacode part in the code, while the codebcode part runs. This shows that the value can never go up, and thus I can never find a value like 0.4 because it would have to go 0.5, 0.25, 0.37.5, 0.4375 etc, but it can only go down 0.5, 0.25, 0.125 and then stops sooner or laterp  pI can see it run the b. part many times when it has to go down, but it never goes up. I switched them around as well, to see if there is an order effect but there isnt it simply does not evaluate it to be true ever even when I know it is Can anyone see what is going wrong, as this is working in R p  precodedef CalcThetagrensscore, alpha, beta     theta  0.5     estimate  [10000]    I just set this to not error on the check     up  1     down  0      whilemath.fabssumestimate  grensscore gt 0.00001          if estimate  [10000]      I set it like this,              estimate  [grensscore]  so it will skip the first run           a.         if sumestimate  grensscore lt 0             down  theta             printdown             theta  theta  up  2             printtheta          b.         if sumestimate  grensscore gt 0             printup, down, theta             up  theta             theta  theta  down  2             printup, down, theta          for x in rangelenbeta             if x  0                 estimate  []              estimate.appendmath.expalpha[x]  theta  beta[x]   1  math.expalpha[x]  theta  beta[x]      returntheta  CalcTheta50, data[,1], data[,2] codepre

I also start a codeMediaPlayercode to play a instrumental.  To get the vocals and the instrumental to mix at the right positions on the server, I send the instrumental delay to pad the instrumental at the beginning with silence beatDelayInSeconds  codeMediaPlayercode delay from when start is called to it actually being played since there is latency when starting media player.p  pMy logic must be wrong because the timing on the playback of the vocals and the instrumental is off on the device. Some times the recording will be too fast, sometimes it will be too slow in comparison to when the instrumental is playing. Any suggestions. Any help would be greatly appreciated.p  pFor better explanationp  pVoice Recording Startedp  pp  pBeatInstrumental Starts playing afterwardsp  p[X]p  pI am trying to find X so I can send that to startPlayback method as beatDelayInSeconds and to the server.

Negative 87 pI tried putting all I could into the question but heres the flesh of it,p  pWould it be practical to make a deferred renderer which instead of having a Diffuse  Specular Buffer it had a Material  UV Buffer, The Materials would be handled similar to tiled light culling, the shader would be passed the required textures specular, diffuse, glow, decal, etc. etc. and sample them using the UVs in the UV buffer.p  pI was just trying to think of a way to get the benefits of deferred rendering and the flexibility of forward rendering, I couldnt think of a reason why this would get the worst of both, but Im not able to find any information on anything similar so I dont know what its pros and cons are in practicality.p

Negative 87 pI have an interesting dilemma to which I didnt find a solution yet...  Hope someone can point me into the right direction.p  pIm working with knockout  MVVM and I was kinda fed up of making ajax request about anywhere in my solution for the same data...  So I decided to create a small library to load and manage the common data and start using it from there.  This works and its fine.p  pBased on this, i have a lot of views where i would need to be able to select multiple options and have the server notify of them.  ive written some logic to do this, and in essence this works to fine now through checkboxes  and checked and having iselected on the object , ... and when finished looping through the array , checking the isselected and returning a new array with the ids of the selected objects...p  pheres the thing, although, this works fine.  i have to do it per entity over and over again... so, in my optimizing mood i thought... p  pinstead of having e.g. p  ul liCountry base functionobject with the definition for Language  isselectedli liCountryList containing the array and the logic to return the selected idsli liLanguage base functionobject with the definition for Language  isselectedli liLanguageList containing the array and the logic to return the selected idsli li..... li ul  pI thought I could try to make a generic solution like...     Base functionobject  could be anything generic  country, language, ...    Selector Function which holds an array of Base objects with addition isselected on itp  pso i could do something like    incoming JSON  foreach create BASE objects and put into BASE arrayp  pCreateObservableArrayFunction Base array which adds isselected logic and can return the id of any generic object as long as they have the id property.p  pit should be also possible to use this function to use it in the MVC views itself...p  pA note... the same could be used also for filtering etc.p  pMaybe a explained it badly, but i think this could be useful for other too instead of having to duplicate code all the time.p  pThanks for your comments.p  pJ.p

If anyone has a better idea I would be really happy.p  pEdit Also posted this in the Hibernate Forums now p  h2emstrongUpdate 2emstrongh2  pSo I managed to get around this issue by setting the autodetectDataSource property in the TransactionManager to falsep  precodeltproperty nameautodetectDataSource valuefalsegt codepre  pI got this hint from the following post a hrefhttpforum.springsource.orgshowthread.php123478SessionFactoryconfiguredformultitenancybutnotenantidentifierspecifiedhttpforum.springsource.orgshowthread.php123478SessionFactoryconfiguredformultitenancybutnotenantidentifierspecifieda. Unfortunately I am now stuck at exactly that issue.  But this is a problem for another topic. Edit Turns out this was only misconfiguration from earlier testing  one old dependencyp  pAs for this topic the problem remains that I want to somehow be able to reuse the DataSource, which I already have in the configuration for the use of Spring Security anyway, for Hibernate to avoid the need for having to configure the DataSource in two places.   So the question still stands how to integrate the use of the DataSource in my MultiTenantConnectionProvider. Does anyone have an idea on where to find any hints on thatp

Negative 87 pI am writing a code in Processing 2.0 and have embedded it in Java environment using Eclipse. The code has many parameters which I frequently need to access in all classes. Below is the example of parameters I work with in the program.p  precodeimgPath  dataimgA.svg dataFile  datalog.csv N  64.4 S  52.0 codepre  pMost of the parameters are file directory paths or few global parameters. I want to create a config file that can hold all the above parameters which I can included in my Java program.

Negative 87 pOur app is moving from paid to free, and in the process, moving a key functionality from being included to activating via InApp purchase.  Obviously, we dont want current users who paid for the app functionality to be charged again in the InApp purchase for functionality they already had.  So on the update by the user, we want to 1 identify current users and 2 make it so they dont see the InApp purchase in the first place, sort of faking the InApp purchase so that the app will appear to them exactly as it did before.p  pThe app does not have a backend, so we have to determine current users from new by examining the saved user data fields for certain values.  I do understand that if a previous user has deleted the app from their device that nothing can be done, and I dont mind charging them for the InApp purchase, since they never used the app anyway.p  pBut for those current users who update and assuming we can examine the saved user data and determine that they are current users, what would be a good way to bypass the InApp purchase and make the app look like they already got it, when in fact they never paid for it  Thanks p

Negative 87 pI am currently thinking which implementation of PagerAdapter should I use. Ive got dilemmas connected to both of them. Let me show you what are these.p  p1 FragmentPagerAdapterp  pWorks fine, It creates new instances of fragments when none previous instances are available and retrieves previously fragments when theres such opportunity.p  pIve read recently on StackOverflow that, method codePagerAdapterscode codegetItemcode method is called ONLY when it need to create fragment, but  it is called over and over and I had to handle creating new instances and retrieving old ones inside this methods body.p  pBUT  Only few callback and lifecycle methods are called. For example I cant manage to codeonSaveInstanceStatecode to be called. So theres no way to save fragments state  of course I can use codeSharedPreferencescode or something else, but I wanted to use callback methods. Is there any way to accomplish thatp  p2 FragmentStatePagerAdapterp  pWorks perfectly, saves state of every fragment that codeViewPagercode holds.p  psBUT  this codePagerAdaptercode ALWAYS creates new fragment. I checked it inside constructor.p  pIsnt that inefficient I saw Romain Guy on Google IO materials saying that creating new codeViewscode is not efficient, especially when we creating lots of codeViewscode like in codeListViewcode so we use codeconvertViewcode to retrieve existing codeViewcode and change it for our purposes as many times as we want to. So fliping between pages is quite similar  many new codeViewscode  because fragment is a some kind of codeViewcodep  pIn both codePagerAdapterscode I tried trick with Overriding codedestroyItemcode method but It didnt work at all.sp  pAnd heres my question.p  pWhat should I dop  pShould I use codeSharedPreferencescode and option 1 with codeFragmentPagerAdaptercode or option 2 with codeFragmentStatePagerAdaptercodep  pIs there any possibility, that I do something wrong within these adapters, to they behave not as we expect top  pBelow is my code divided into readable partsp  pPagerAdapter part 1p  precode   Adapter class to link WizardPager   public static class WizardCrazyAdapter extends FragmentStatePagerAdapter     implements OnPageChangeListener      public static final String tag  androidswitcherR.id.pagerw             Refernece to root activity           WizardActivity wizardActivity             list of fragments           private final ArrayListltFragmentInfogt fInfos  new ArrayListltFragmentInfogt      private short prevPageNumber  0             Constructor of adapter       param wizardActivity                  link WizardActivity as reference to activity root           public WizardCrazyAdapterWizardActivity wizardActivity          superwizardActivity.getSupportFragmentManager         this.wizardActivity  wizardActivity                      static final class FragmentInfo          private final Classltgt clss         private Bundle args          public FragmentInfoClassltgt clss, Bundle args              clss   clss             args   args                    public void addPageClassltgt clss, Bundle args         FragmentInfo fi  new FragmentInfoclss, args                  fInfos.addfi                  Return number of pages           public int getCount          return fInfos.size      codepre  pPagerAdapter part 2p  precode           Searches in link FragmentManager for link Fragment at specified position       param position       return           private AbstractWizardFragment getFragmentAtint position         FragmentManager fm  wizardActivity.getSupportFragmentManager          AbstractWizardFragment awf  AbstractWizardFragment fm.findFragmentByTagtagposition          return awf                           Return page of view pager           Override     public Fragment getItemint position          finding existing instance of fragment         AbstractWizardFragment awf  getFragmentAtposition          ifawf  null             creating new instance if no instance exist             Log.vWizardActivity, creating new Fragment             FragmentInfo fi  fInfos.getposition             awf  AbstractWizardFragment Fragment.instantiatewizardActivity, fi.clss.getName         else             Log.vWizardActivity, found existing Fragment                   return awf      codepre  pPagerAdapter part 3p  precode    Override     public void onPageSelectedint pageNumber          wizardActivity.stepFragment.setCurrentStepAndChangeTextpageNumber          ifpageNumber  prevPageNumber             AbstractWizardFragment prevFragment  AbstractWizardFragment getItemprevPageNumberTODO change if any problems             prevFragment.onDetachedFromViewPagerwizardActivity.mForm                   AbstractWizardFragment currFragment  AbstractWizardFragment getItempageNumberTODO change if any problems         currFragment.onAttachedToViewPagerwizardActivity.mForm          prevPageNumber  short pageNumber           Log.dWizardActivity, onPageSelected           Override     public Object instantiateItemViewGroup arg0, int arg1          Log.dWizardActivity, instantiateItem arg1         return super.instantiateItemarg0, arg1           Override     public void destroyItemViewGroup container, int position, Object object                super.destroyItemcontainer, position, object          Log.vWizardActivity, that would be destroy       codepre  pViewPager codep  precodepublic class WizardPager extends ViewPager     Flag to check if view pager must be scrolled    protected boolean isScrollable     Default constructor   param context link Context   public WizardPagerContext context      supercontext     isScrollable  true      Standard constructor   param context link Context   param attrs link AttributeSet   public WizardPagerContext context, AttributeSet attrs      supercontext, attrs     isScrollable  true   Override public boolean onTouchEventMotionEvent event      if this.isScrollable          return super.onTouchEventevent           return false   Override public boolean onInterceptTouchEventMotionEvent event      if this.isScrollable          return super.onInterceptTouchEventevent           return false      Enable scroll of pages   public void enableScroll     this.isScrollable  true      Disable scroll of pages   public void disableScroll     this.isScrollable  false      Check if pages can be scrolled   return   public boolean isScrollable     return isScrollable   codepre

Im doing this by calculating the width of the text like sop  precodeint textWidth  0 String[] lines  string.splitn for String line  lines      int lineWidth  int tv.getPaint.measureTextline     if lineWidth gt textWidth          textWidth  lineWidth       int width  m.getPaddingLeft  tv.getPaddingLeft  textWidth              tv.getPaddingRight  m.getPaddingRight codepre  pThen I Override the onMeasure method of the ViewGroup to force the width to be at least as long as the textp  precodeOverride protected void onMeasureint widthMeasureSpec, int heightMeasureSpec      super.onMeasurewidthMeasureSpec, heightMeasureSpec     int newWidth  Math.maxgetMeasuredWidth, width     setMeasuredDimensionnewWidth, getMeasuredHeight  codepre  pAll of this is working as expected, but it allows the text to get really big  too big apparently.p  pstrongAttempted Solutionsstrong I guessed that the problem was with OpenGL being unable to render something that long, so I queried the codeGLMAXTEXTURESIZEcode OpenGL parameter and compared it to the codewidthcode. Sure enough, the problem occurs when codewidth gt GLMAXTEXTURESIZEcode.p  pTo solve this problem, I wrote some code to a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidetopicsgraphicshardwareaccel.htmlcontrolling relnofollowdisable hardware acceleration on the viewa when the text is too longp  precodeint[] maxGlTexSize  new int[1] GLES20.glGetIntegervGLES20.GLMAXTEXTURESIZE, maxGlTexSize, 0 if width gt maxGlTexSize[0]      Log.eDebug, Too big for GL     tv.setLayerTypeView.LAYERTYPESOFTWARE, null  else      Log.iDebug, Small enough for GL     tv.setLayerTypeView.LAYERTYPENONE, null  codepre  pHowever, strongthis code doesnt workstrong for me. When the condition is met the text is too long, strongthe textview becomes invisiblestrong. This also happens if I try to use codeLAYERTYPEHARDWAREcode. I tried that because a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidetopicsgraphicshardwareaccel.htmltips relnofollowthe Hardware Acceleration guidea says to set the layer type to HARDWARE for large views with alpha.p  pAlso, I did try permanently setting the view layer type. The results were slightly different for the two typesp  ul lipcodeLAYERTYPESOFTWAREcode When the activity is created with text smaller than the limit, it renders fine. When text is added to surpass the limit, the view disappears. When the text is shortened to be within the limit again, it reappears.pli lipcodeLAYERTYPEHARDWAREcode Identical to codeLAYERTYPESOFTWAREcode except that the text does not reappear when shortened after being too long. The activity must be recreated in order for the text to reappear.pli ul  h1TLDRh1  pIm having a view rendering problem caused by OpenGL limitations, but codeview.setLayerTypeView.LAYERTYPESOFTWARE, nullcode is making the view disappear rather than fixing the problem.p

Negative 87 pIm using OpenCVs codefindContourscode for blobfinding, by floodfilling at an arbitrary seed point in the contour and taking the bounding rectangle of the floodfill.

I use LaTeX, and I need my figures to be prepared as highquality Encapsulated PostScript EPS images. The work order is as follows. First, I plot parts of my figure using matplotlib and save them in EPS format. Second, I launch Inkscape and import the EPS files. Using Inkscape I compose a figure, leaving needed objects, killing unneeded, and adding some markups. So I used to do when I worked with CorelDraw in Windows, but now I work in Linux. p  pUnfortunately, Inkscape damages EPS files it changes the colors and does not save all the objects. Over last years I tried to search for a solution, but I cannot find that people complained. The complaints found on the Web are related to something like incorrect font rendering when exporting from svg to eps or back. For me this is not a problem  the text always can be represented as curves.p  pI currently work in Mandriva Linux 2010 and use Inkscape version 0.47 r22583 Jan 14 2010.

Negative 87 pI am applying binding validation to a few WPF controls in .NET 4.0. Currently, my controls turn red and display a little warning message when they fail a certain set of ValidationRules. The problem is that, they still fail their respective validations even though they are disabled.

I am not exactly sure how to implement this functionality.p  pI validate through Binding.ValidationRule which connects through a specific validation class.p  pstrongEDITstrong The reason that the errors are showing is because my validation checks if the field is empty.

Negative 87 pWe have an app running on 8.5.3 servers windows with a field set as Dateonly in the Notes backend. No time component gets saved. There is a list style Xpage with a ViewPanel that displays these dates from a Notes view data source, and a form that opens from a link in that view that also shows the same field in the linked record. We are in North America.p  pAfter UTC midnight, which is 7 pm Eastern, all of the date column values shown in the view will roll back to the previous day. The linked document in the formoriented Xpage still shows the proper date as can be seen in a Notes client, and in a Notes info box showing hidden field values. p  pThe XSP application property setting for Time Zone has no effect on this behavior. I added time zone to the display format pattern MMddYYYY vv in the viewPanel and also to the field in the forms panel, and both are showing the same time zone, GMT 4. So the date displayed in the viewPanel is in error, as far as I can tell. p  pI also have verified the same behavior on a Domino 9 server. Is there a workaround for the view list or should we try it on 8.5.2p

Negative 87 pin my website i have a simple navigation bar where clicking on the different items causes the main content to change. Technically, all is done in a single file main.html, which contains everything and i use the jquery function load to dynamically load other html files to place it inside the main.html. This works just fine as long as there is no javascript in these html files i embedded. But there is one file i want to embedd, which has also javascript code in it, which should get executed on document.ready. But this never happens  there is no error in the javascript, it just never gets executed. I suppose its because i only change the DOM of the main.html and then there will be no onReady event fired. Can someone give me some idea of what would be the best way to get the desired behaviour Placing the javascript in the main.html would cause things to work, but this is no option for me.p  pThanks in advancep  pstrongupdate problem solvedstrong Problem is solved.

Negative 87 pI have a model Laps, which belongs to Carp  pSo each car has many laps, but I need to do a query where i pull in the top 10 fastest Laps, but only pull in the fastest lap per each car. In other words, I do not want one car to be allowed to have 5 of the top 10 fastest laps in the list.p  pEach lap has a carid field. I want to group on this column, and then pull out the lap with the minLap.time row from the grouping. AKA fastest lap time from that unique carid.p  pSo with Postgres, what is my best approach to this Can I order all laps first, then group, and then pull the first from the group. Or will grouping not keep the sort orderp  pHere is my schema for the Lap Modelp  precode  createtable laps, force true do t     t.decimal  time     t.string   videourl     t.integer  carid     t.datetime createdat     t.datetime updatedat     t.integer  userid     t.boolean  approved   end codepre  pDo I have to use two combined queries for thisp  pI can get a unique car ids lap by doing thisp  precodeselectDISTINCT ON carid  codepre  pbut, I need to order the laps so that it gets the minlap.time per that carid. So when i throw on an order like thisp  precodeselectDISTINCT ON carid .ordercarid, time ASC.sortby ts ts.time codepre  pThis works, but seems like an odd way to go about it. As soon as i try and change around the order, like removing the carid from the order, i get postgres errors.p
Negative 87 pIve inherited a project that somehow ended up with random rows in the application settings table getting duplicated. I got the duplicate rows removed successfully, but then I noticed that the actual values, of type nvarchar, for said rows are also duplicated.p  pFor instance, one row has Key column codeError Email Addresscode and Value column codewebsupportmycompany.com,websupportmycompany.comcode. The Value column should just contain codewebsupportmycompany.comcode. There are numerous records like this, all following the same pattern of codeThe value,The valuecode. p  pHow can I detect when the Value column contains this kind of duplicated data and correct itp  pNote that the comma alone is not enough to say the row is invalid, because things like Key codeDefault Error Messagecode Value codeOops, something went wrongcode are correct and also contain a comma. p

Negative 87 pI have a customized Grid control that is inherited from Gridview that has search and pagination. Everything works great except this one little thing. Whenever I use the pager to go to the next page, then I use the search, the event that handles the search does not fire on the first click, it takes a second click to get it to fire. Any ideasp  pThe code for the control is herep  pa hrefhttpssites.google.comsitejoecdevelopment relnofollowGrid.csap  pbImportant Notebp  pI am aware that it is frowned upon to post large blocks of code... But, the entire controls code is posted to give the whole picture of how it is built. The control itself is a bit on the complex side as it performs searching, sorting, and pagination all serverside and this code is a completely custom control that just INHERITS the GridView.p  pI AM NOT looking for someone to write a fix for me, just an idea of why this one situation may be happeningp  pWith that said, to break things down a little more with the code... The search form text box and buttons are created dynamically and added in the CreateChildControls method. The search form works perfectly when the Grid is initially loaded, but after using the pagination, the first click of the Search button does not fire the method assigned to the Search buttons command event, but the second click does. It seems as though something in the postback is not recognizing the buttons command event has been triggered... p  pA trace of the calls to the methods showp  p1st Click  Everything from ViewState is loaded, no postback events are called.p  p2nd Click  Everything from ViewState is loaded, postback events called.p  pIm looking for ideas on where to go from here, as Ive been trying everything I can think of page lifecycle wise to see if I can get this functioning properly. The only thing that has worked is setting EnableEventValidation to false on the page that implements the Grid control, and performing the initial data bind on every PageLoad not just if IsPostback. But, for obvious reasons, that is not an acceptable solution.p
Negative 87 pIve inherited a solution to support based on .NET and SQL Server 2008 R2.p  pThe architecture is such that all clients must be kept in step with each other, and this is handled by a winsock hub to which each client sends and receives notifications of changes made. These notifications are in the form of a type of update and a key field.p  pOn receipt of a notification, client windows inspect the type of update and if they think they are interested then issue a database command Stored procedure to retrieve the latest data for that key value. The stored procedure typically invoked links a number of tables to return a rather large object.p  pMy problem is that when many clients are active, they are calling the same stored procedure at the same time and dragging perforamnce down e.g. a lt 1 second query, when called in isolation can take c20 seconds as it presumably waits for other clients to complete.p  pIs there anything out of the box in SQL server that can help me with this  Im thinking of caching of results or ways in which I can stop one query blocking another  p  pI appreciate that I should probably make some changes on the client code and notification process to pass around fully populated objects so removing the need to interrogate the database multiple times. However this is a legacy application with a limited lifespan, which would be a headache to upgrade in such a significant way. If there were a nice simple switch in SQL server I could use, that would buy me the time I needp  pThanks, Andrewp

Negative 87 pWe are thinking about detecting the hand, user is holding his mobile device, right or left hand or both. As far as our knowledge we think this is not possible with 100 accuracy with the current hardware, we even dont think it would have an accuracy over 90 but if you try to achieve this with the available sensor data which most of the smartphones have today. How would you process those sensor data and how would you decide p  pOur initial thoughts are,p  ul liChecking horizontal angle via gyroscope,li liDeciding based on face recognition and the angle with eyes using camera,li ul  pIf you ask why would you do such thing, p  pAs devices get larger such as samsung note2, note3, touching every side of the screen is getting harder which causes user experienceergonomy problems. We think if we can detect this automatically with a reasonable accuracy we may adjust our layouts to serve better user experience. p  pThanks everyone sharing your thoughts,p

BUT if the product meets the criteria to have an overview tab the code above I want that tab to be active. p  pNow, you may ask, why dont you just use the code.Addtabcode and then have the codeActiveTabIndexcode be where you inserted the new tab. Well, I tried that and for some reason when I would do the check or just add it in directly in the code above the whole codeTabContainercode would not display, at all. p  pSo in about half of the products I am working with I have the problem of this text showing in the wrong tab, the other half doesnt have the problem because there is no overview tab or the other 2 dynamically loaded tabs present.p

Negative 87 pI am in the very early phases of a WinForms product rewrite, and I am trying to determine the best strategy for implementing a new solution structure. The current solution contains 50 projects, and for the most part it contains all of the logic required to run the application.  Several of the projects do have dependencies to projects that exist in a separate Framework solution, but that is being replaced  modified as well. p  pAs I said, the current solution produces a WinForms product furthermore everything is tightly coupled together, front to back.  Additionally, we want to start offering a Web  Mobile solution in addition toalongside our WinForms product.  Because of the desired changes, I am considering breaking this out into several separate solutions. Details follow.p  ul liProduct.Framework Solution becomes Product.Core  A shared set of assemblies containing common interfaces, enums, structs, helpers, etc. li liProduct.Windows  MVC pattern. Contains all views and business logic necessary to run the WinForms product.li liProduct.Web  MVC Pattern. Contains all views and business logic necessary to run the Web product.li liProduct.Services  Hostable WCF services.  Contains the public service layer that WebWinMobile call into with the underlying DAL.li ul  pThis is where I am looking for a sanity check  I am planning on implementing DIIoC in both the WinForms and Web project I am not so much worried about injecting into the WCF services in my mind it makes sense to have interfaces of all the concrete entities representation of database tables and services in the Product.Core solution. The only reference I would possibly need to Product.Services in the Web and Winforms solutions would be to register the concrete types with the container.    p  pDoes this make sense  Is there something glaring that I have overlooked  Thank you for any and all feedbackp

Negative 87 pI am writing an IOS SDK and allow users to implement Oauth2.0 flow in their ios app using my SDK.p  pI ask developers to create a custom url scheme that they pass in as a callback url to my webview controller.p  pthe webview loads my sites oauth2.0 flow url. When the user finishes authenticating, mysite redirects to the developers custom url scheme and closes itself after sending the authorization  code to the developers success callback function after detecting that the current url matches the callback url the developer passed in.p  pThen from their server, the developer uses their application key and secret to exchange that authorization code for an access token. p  pIs that the right way to approach such a project p

Negative 87 pI have an app with multiple views that uses a navigation controller. On some of the views, I need a toolbar with buttons that pertain to that view. While I have successfully added custom buttons to certain views tool bars, I am having a big problem maintaining the state of those tool bars. For example, when navigating to a view that has a custom toolbar, all of the other views in the app seem to inherit that toolbars state. For example, view A needs a toolbar with button X. This works as planned. However, when navigating to view B, view As toolbar is loaded into view B.p  pI have tried deconfiguring the toolbar on viewDidDisappear with limited results. When using this method, there is latency in removing the custom items. For example, when navigating to another view, the buttons dont disappear until the next view has loaded. p  pReally, all I need is a toolbar that stays at the bottom of the view and does not scroll away when the user scrolls the view. It seems the only way to achieve this is to lock it into a navigation controllers toolbar. However, this approach creates numerous other issues including those mentioned above. p  pAgain, the behavior I am looking for is to have a toolbar that is always at the bottom of the view and is independent from the scrolling of the viewtableview. Is there a way to achieve this without using a navigation controller Thanksp

Negative 87 pIm having a super simple problem, but I also had a question, so I figured Id post both.  p  pFirst of all, Im not sure whats not working about this program cycling through an array and out putting the values.  Whats happening now, is that it just outputs the last value in the array.p  precodeint myArray[10]  0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34  int i  0  for i  0 i lt 9 i      cout ltlt i  1 ltlt t ltlt myArray[i] ltlt endl  codepre  pthats not working for some reason, but I also wanted to know why, if I initialize the i variable inside the for loop, it says myArray[i] inside of the for loops, at the cout, isnt initialized at all.  Peculiar to me.p

Negative 87 pIm working on a third person character control for a game im developing. Im happy with the results so far. The character controls have a lot of neat features like if an object is in front of the camera it will move forward so you can still see the character, however the camera stutters horribly when I rotate it to the side and then turn my player away from it. I uploaded a test on JSFiddle a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netnA8SV relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netnA8SVa I have only tested this in chrome, and for some reason the results part doesnt get the keypresses until you click on the white space bordering the canvas on that frame.p  pstrong[also i started chrome with disablewebsecurity to ignore the cross origin]strongp  pBut once you click the page the key presses work. The controls are a modified version of the orbital controls. So you can left click and rotate the view. Additionally you can use the wasd keys to move around and the camera view should return behind the player when you are movingrotating.p  pI apologize for the buggyness this was very difficult to get working on JSFiddle. But the rotation bug is happening so it at least reproduces that.p  pBasically Im trying to get my camera rotation back behind my character, so i have some code that fixes the rotation on line 250, but the camera stutters as the character moves.p  pHere are my theories I think the camera overall jerkyness has something to do with the physics simulation bouncing the player around slightly, but Im not sure what to do to solve this, any help would be appreciated.p  phere is the code for completeness but I would recommend the JSFiddle link, Its much easier to see it work.p

Negative 87 pIn MATLAB, I did lossless predictive coding of standard images by predicting the next sample from previous samples, subtracting the predicted value from the actual one, and encoding the error using Huffman coding. I decoded the errors as well, but now I have an array of errors without knowing how to go back to the original image. How do I predict the values of the original image matrix from these errorsp  pJust in case this helps, my predictor is of different types to see which one gives the best result, with X being the actual value of a sample  1 I take three neighboring values of X, find their average, and subtract them from X to obtain the error. 2 I used the predictor AB2, where A and B are neighboring values of X, and subtract from X.p  pAnd others like that. Theres a pretty comprehensive list out there.p  pAny advice on how to predict the original values at the decoderp

Therefore, I expected for the labels to never exceed 600 because the max is set to 600. However, it is doing this if the label has enough text.

Without that constraint, my label was running off the frame.p  pIs there a way to do this so I dont have to add wmax 600 to each label that I add. It seems to defeat the purpose of the 600 constraint for the column.p

Negative 87 pIm using a DB First implementation of Entity Framework and Ive run into an issue with a need for a computed column and the interaction with a view...p  pScenariop  pUser has FirstName and LastName.  In a listbox I want to use a display name generated from FirstName and LastName.  Generally, simple enough.  The issue comes from when either the first name or last name gets edited.  Ive extended my entities with INotifyPropertyChanged and implemented that in the T4 template.  I extended the User entity to create a DisplayName property.  In the View I use a CollectionViewSouorce based on the DisplayName.p  pThe issue comes in when a users name is edited, but no notification occurs because the change is made to either FirstName or LastName, not DisplayName.  So the CollectionViewSource is never getting a change notification for DisplayName.p  pI could, manually, add an OnPropertyChangedDisplayName to the User entity in the FirstName and LastName properties, but that would be overwritten next time I update my model from the DB.p  pAny ideas on how to make this workp  pThanks.p  pJp

Negative 87 pIm working on abstracting out any sort of messaging framework for some code Im working on. Basically, Im using a combination of Spring AOP and Spring Integration to generate messages without the Java code knowing anything about RabbitMQ, JMS, or even Spring Integration. That said, what Im using to generate the messages is contained in its own .jar, and it reused by several other areas of the application. I currently have the messaging system set up such that the channels on which messages are sent are specified by the code that calls the system i.e., channels are generated automatically based on the external method invocation by specifying the channel name in the message header and using a headervalue router to create the channels if they dont exist. My issue comes in on the endpoint of these channels  the intention of the current structure is to allow Spring to change to any messaging structure as requirements specify or change. I know how to take a static channel and use outbound channel convertersgateways to send it to a prespecified RabbitMQJMS queue and process from there what Im struggling with is how to tell Spring that I need emeveryem channel created by the router to have a RabbitMQ or whatever other messaging system gets implemented outbound channel adapter thats dynamically generated based on the channel name since we dont know channel names beforehand.p  pIs this possible And if not, would you mind providing input as to what could perhaps be a better wayp  pThanks ahead of timep  pHeres a basic template of what my config file looks like  I have an initial channel messageChannel which gets sent to a publishsubscribechannel and queuing channel depending on one of the message headers and is routed from there.p  precodeltHeader value based channel configurationsgt ltintchannel idmessageChannel gt ltintchannel idqueue gt ltintpublishsubscribechannel idtopic gt  ltHeaderbased router to route to queue or topic channelsgt ltintheadervaluerouter inputchannelmessageChannel                          headername Tsome.class.with.StringConstants.CHANNELTYPE gt     ltReroutes messages according to their destination and messaging typegt ltintheadervaluerouter inputchannelqueue                          headername Tsome.class.with.StringConstants.MESSAGEDESTINATION gt  ltintheadervaluerouter inputchanneltopic                          headername Tsome.class.with.StringConstants.MESSAGEDESTINATION gt  ltAOP configuration  picks up on any invocation of some.class.which.generates.Messages.generateMessage from a Springmanaged context.gt ltaopconfiggt     ltaoppointcut ideventPointcut                   expressionexecution some.class.which.generates.Messages.generateMessage.. gt      ltaopadvisor advicerefinterceptor pointcutrefeventPointcutgt ltaopconfiggt  ltintpublishinginterceptor idinterceptor defaultchannelmessageChannelgt     ltintmethod patterngenerateMessage payloadreturn channelmessageChannel gt ltintpublishinginterceptorgt codepre

Negative 87 pWell I am on my last day of school trying to finish a program and I cant for the life of me get past this null reference exception. My code is supposed to average together [count] numbers entered by the user using a stack of Integers.

Negative 87 pIve read the NSXPC docs, which advise making the vended service as stateless as possible.  Its a good idea, at least to the docs and examples Ive read, since the service and the calling app see each other as singletons and only one instance of the service runs at a time.  This means that the methods are essentially nonmember functions to use a C term.p  pWhy do I want to get around this  I want to put the network code into a XPC.  Since the XPC will be working with a GUI app, which will have multiple windows, I need to support multiple simultaneous connections.  That doesnt work with singletons, at least directly.p  pThe network API is Cbased, with the main state type a pointer to a custom codestructcode.  So why dont we do something similarp  ol liHave the creation function return a value type, like codeNSUUIDcode or something.  Passing a pointer across processes would be a bad idea.li liIn the service, create a codeNSDictionarycode or codestdmapcode or whatever mapping between the codeNSUUIDcode and the API Cpointer.li liThe various service APIs take the codeUUIDcode and convert it to the Cpointer to use the network API.li ol  pstrongAsidestrong Since the token is random, if the XPC service crashes, the main app will have a token thats useless after the XPC is restarted.  Maybe I should a URL which would have all the information to restart instead.  But then we get potential conflicts if two connections happen to be to the same server.  Maybe I can combine the ideas with the token being a URLUUID pair.  The UUID value would move from being returned by the service to supplied by the main app.p  pWould this be a good way to implement statefull XPCsp
Negative 87 h1strongtldrstrongh1  pCalling the asynchronous codefs.writeFilecode from asynchronous events and perhaps even from just a plain old loop and then calling codeprocess.exitcode successfully opens the files but fails to flush the data into the files. The callbacks given to codewriteFilecode do not get a chance to run before the process exits. emIs this expected behavioremp  pRegardless of whether codeprocess.exitcode is failing to perform this cleanup, I call into question whether it should be nodes duty to at least attempt to work the file writes into the schedule, because it may very well be the case that the deallocation of huge buffers depends on writing them out to disk.p  h1detailsh1  pI have a conceptually basic piece of node.js code which performs a transformation on a large data file. This happens to be a LiDAR sensors data file, which should not be relevant. It is simply a dataset that is quite large owing to the nature of its existence. It is structurally simple. The sensor sends its data over the network. My task for this script is to produce a separate file for each rotating scan. The details of this logic is irrelevant as well.p  pThe basic idea is I use nodepcap to read a huge code.pcapcode file using the method given to do this task by nodepcap, which is offline mode. p  pWhat this means is that instead of asynchronously catching the network packets as they appear, what appears to be a rather dense stream of asynchronous events representing the packets are generated. p  pSo, the main structure of the program consists of a few global state variables, and a single callback to the pcap session. I initialize globals, then assign the callback function to the pcap session. This callback to the codepacketcode event does all the work.p  pPart of this work is writing out a large array of data files. Once in a while a packet will indicate some condition that means I should move on to writing into the next data file. I increment the data filename index, and call codefs.writeFilecode again to begin writing the new file. Since I am writing only, it seems natural to let node decide when a good time is to begin writing. p  pBasically, both codefs.writeFileSynccode and codefs.writeFilecode should end up calling the OSs codewritecode system call on their respective files in an asynchronous fashion. This does not bother me because I am only writing, so the asynchronous nature of the write which can affect certain access patterns does not matter to me since I do not do any access. The only difference is in that codewriteFileSynccode forces the node event loop to block until such time as the codewritecode syscall completes.p  pAs the program progresses, when I use codewriteFilecode the jsasynchronous version, hundreds of my output files are created, but no data is written to them. Not one. The very first data file is still open when the hundredth data file is created.p  pThis is conceptually fine. The reason is that node is busy crunching new data, and is happily holding on to the increasing number of file descriptors that it will eventually get to in order to write the files data in. Meanwhile it also has to keep inside of memory all the eventual contents of the files. This will eventually run out, but lets ignore the RAM size limitation for a moment. Obviously a bad thing to happen here would be running out of RAM and crashing the program. Hopefully node will be smart and realize it just needs to schedule some file writes and then it can free a bunch of buffers...p  pIf I stick a statement in the middle of all this to call codeprocess.exitcode, I would expect that node will emclean up and flush the pending codewriteFilecode writesem before exiting. p  pBut node does not do this. p  pChanging to codewriteFileSynccode fixes the problem obviously.  Changing and truncating my input data such that codeprocess.exitcode is not explicitly called also results in the files eventually getting written and the completion callback given to codewriteFilecode to run at the very end when the input events are done pumping.p  pThis seems to indicate for me that the cleanup is being improperly performed by codeprocess.exitcode.p  pstrongQuestionstrong Is there some alternative to exiting the event loop cleanly in the middle Note I had to manually truncate my large input file, because terminating with codeprocess.exitcode caused all the file writes to not complete.p  pThis is node codev0.10.26code installed a while ago on OS X with Homebrew.p  pContinuing with my thought process, the behavior that I am seeing here calls into question the fundamental purpose of using codewriteFilecode. Its supposed to improve things to be able to flexibly write my file whenever node deems it fit. However, apparently if nodes event loop is pumped hard enough, then it will basically get behind on its workload. p  pIt is like the event loop has an inbox and an outbox. In this analogy, the outbox represents the temp variables containing the data I am writing to the files. The assumption that a lazy productive programmer like me wants to make is that the inbox and outbox are interfaces that I can use and that they are flexible and that the system will manage for me. However if I feed the inbox at too high a rate, then node actually cant keep up, and it will just start piling the data into the outbox without having any time to flush it because for one reason or another, the scheduling is such that all the incoming events have to get processed first. This in turn defers all garbage collection of the outboxs contents, and quite quickly we deplete the systems RAM. This is quite easily a hardtofind bug when this pattern is used in a complex system. I am glad I took a modular approach to this project.p  pI mean, yes, clearly, obviously, beyond all doubt the answer is to use codewriteFileSynccode as I do almost every single time that I write files with node. p  pWhat, then, is the value in even emhavingem codewriteFilecode At this point I am trading a potential small increase in parallel processing for the increased possibility that if for some reason the machines processing capability drops whether its thermal throttling or OS level scheduling or I dont pay my IaaS bills on time, or any other reason, that it can potentially lead to a snowballing memory explosionp  pPerhaps this is getting at the core of solving the truly rather complex problems inherent in streaming data processing systems, and that I cannot realistically expect this eventbased processing model to step up and elegantly solve these problems automatically. Maybe I should be satisfied that it only gets me about half of the way to something robust. Maybe I am just projecting my wishes onto it and that it is unreasonable for me to assume that node needs to less deterministically improve the scheduling of its event loop. p
Negative 87 pI generated a group of nelement arrays that consist of alternating 1 and 1 followed by zeros, all starting with 1.p  pFor example, for n5, the arrays are 10000, 11000, 11100, 11110, 11111,p  pI need to insert the zeros between the nonzero numbers for each array For 11100 in the above example, the enumeration isp  p1 1 1 0 0,allow some 1 and 1 to have no 0 between them.p  p1 1 0 1 0,p  p1 0 1 1 0,p  p1 0 1 0 1,p  p1 0 0 1 1,p  p1 1 0 0 1 the first element still needs to be 1p  pIs there a good algorithm to generate such enumeration for an given array with the above formatp  pI think the problem is like putting identical apples into different platesbecause putting zeros into different gaps gives different enumeration and allowing some plates to remain empty.p  pI need to print out all the possibilities, not just count them.

Negative 87 pI am using ImageLoader in my app to load images for tableview. It works perfect for small images as it was designed for. But in my app I load some images that are nearly 3MB and when I load in a tableview45 cells my app crashes after couple of refreshes. I understand that the ImageLoader is not the right API for this, but how do I download or infact load a scaled down version of the image so that there is no memory hog. The tableview does not need a high resolution image and since its showing a small thumbnail size, I would like to know what is the best option to load in IOS and if there are any predefined API available. For Android I use the android developer recommended bitmap sizing functions to scale down the image.p

Negative 87 pI have a space themed game with a spaceship that moves around with the camera and rotates using the SINampCOS functions, to a 1 degree accuracy. The spaceship moves and rotates correctly. I am now looking into firing shots from said spaceship. p  pSo far I can create a shot going right from the spaceship no matter which direction it may be facing. However I was wondering if there is a way for me to spawn in a shot based on where the spaceship is facing I can handle all angles of the shot after I have it spawned. I cannot yet figure out how to get it to spawn in front of the spaceship based on its rotation. p  pI am using SDL2 with C 11.p  pI do not want you to directly tell me the code if possible, because I will not learn anything from that. I am using this as a learning experience. Would I need to state points of the spawn location for each 1 degree angle of the spaceships 360 degree turning cycle Or is their a more dynamic way of doing such a thingp

Negative 87 pId like to be able to do an asynchronous wait on a specific event.  There are a lot of similar questions and answers on here and all compile and work for me but none with my specific scenario.  Basically, what I need to be able to do is an asyncwait, passing a yield context as the handler, to a timer that waits indefinitely, and is then canceled by another thread.p  pFor example, there is a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17005258whydoesboostasionotsupportaneventbasedinterfaceforexamplesomething titlethis questionthis questiona which does something very similar, but instead of using a yield context, it uses a separate, standalone handler.  There is also something like a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions21771639caniuseastackfulcoroutineasthewaithandlerofasteadytimerwhichisde titlethis questionthis questiona which uses a yield context, but waits for a specified amount of time.p  pI can change my code to look like either of the two examples above and things work fine.  But for someone reason when I combine a yieldcontext handler and a cancelled timer, I get the following exceptionp  precodelibcabi.dylib terminating with uncaught exception of type boostexceptiondetailcloneimplltboostexceptiondetailcurrentexceptionstdexceptionwrapperltstdruntimeerrorgt gt  Program ended with exit code 9 codepre  pFrom what I can tell, it looks like things choke when trying to invoke the completion handler which in this case is the yield context.p  pAlright, enough babbling, heres the code.

Negative 87 pThis question has been asked before but not under the context of a multithreaded application.  p  pSo given a single threaded application, a dictionary will find the value given a key in O1 time.  Given a table from a database which has a primary key cluster index on column X, a search for the associated tuple with a key on column X will be found the tuple in Olog n time.  Add the inmemory benefit of the dictionary, the dictionary wins hands down.  p  pGiven a highly parallel e.g. async socket server application that relies on a common datastructure i.e., Dictionary vs Database to maintain application wide state information e.g. connected users where say 50 of the accesses are reads and about 50 of the accesses are updatesdeletesinserts, it does not seem so obvious to me that Dictionary is better.  For the following reasonsp  p1 to make the dictionary threadsafe for concurrent access, a locking mechanism must be used.  lock will lock the entire dictionary and effectively only allowing one thread to access the datastructure at a time.  Even using readerWriterLockSlim will lock the entire dictionary when elevated to writeLock.br 2 Databases give the benefit of rowlevel locking when updatingdeletinginserting on a primary key.br 3 Dictionaries are inmemory faster while database connection use sockets slowerp  pSo the question is, does the inherit rowlevel locking features of a relational database out weigh the benefits of inmemory Dictionary accesses p

The models attributes are the image urls to use when rendering the portrait.p  pThe picture model is passed to the ejs results page as codethisimgcode, where I store the urls like thisp  precodelt var background  thisimg.background gt lt var animal  thisimg.animal gt lt var itemone  thisimg.itemone gt lt var itemtwo  thisimg.itemtwo gt lt var img  thisimg.img gt codepre  pAnd the portrait is created like sop  precodeltdiv idresult stylebackgroundimageurllt background gtgt     ltdiv idmainImg stylebackgroundimageurllt img gtgtltdivgt     ltdiv idanimal stylebackgroundimageurllt animal gtgtltdivgt     ltdiv iditemone stylebackgroundimageurllt itemone gtgtltdivgt     ltdiv iditemtwo stylebackgroundimageurllt itemtwo gtgtltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pIt looks awesome.p  pMy challenge is to take this portrait and create a single image so that I can upload it to imgur, Facebook, allow the user to save it, etc.p  pGiven that Im using ejs to pass the photo object through, Im not sure what the best way to do this is. All I can think of is getting each div by id and creating a canvas within script.js, but not sure if this would work. Ideally the image would remain fairly highquality. Is there a good solution for thisp

Negative 87 pWhen attempting to use Chrome in application mode as a host for an HTML5 application, there seem to be some severe limitations.p  pFor example, if the user hits codeCTRLTcode it will open up a new Chrome browser window, and allow them to start typing in the address bar. Ditto for codeCTRLWcode. This is disconcerting, as it directly contradicts the intention of application mode to make a web page feel like a normal application thats not in Chrome.p  pIs there some mechanism through which one may disable this functionalityp  pAlternatively, are there forks of the Chrome project which are better suited to wrappingup HTML5 applicationsp

Negative 87 pI am running into an issue with 4.5 and Sitecore 6.5. We are currently using Sitecore.NET 6.5.0 rev. 120706 on  .NET Framework 3.5 along with relevant Telerik controls and AJAXToolkit.p  pWe are trying to migrate the .NET Framework to 4.5.2 now and plan Sitecore migration little later. Along with 4.5.2 Framework, we also tried to use latest versions of AjaxToolKit and Telerik.p  pWhile testing, we observed an issue that is affecting two behaviors. 1. The PageMethods to WebScript Methods on serverside are failing.    On research, we found out that the GetTestMethod call on page www.MYWEBSITE.comFeaturePage1.aspx is going to FeaturePage1.aspxGetTestMethod instead of layoutsWebSite1GeneralBasePage.aspxGetTestMethod.p  pBasePage.aspx is the base page. PageMethods.getpage is returning BasePage.aspx instead of layoutsWebSite1GeneralBasePage.aspxp  ol start2 liThe Telerik controls like RadTreeView on WEBSITEFeaturePage1.aspx are throwing scripting errors saying Telerik is not defined. Page1.aspx is a page inside Features Item under the home page in Sitecore. But if we use a classic asp.net page TestTelerik.aspx under the web sites main folder not in sitecore, the telerik control works normally.li ol  pSo, it looks like ItemResolver, IgnoreURlPrefixes, or something else in the configs is causing this issue.p  pDo I need to change something in the configs for Sitecore to handle this correctly.p  pMy web.config is like belowp  pltsetting

Since Im focusing on learning Python, I figured it would be good practice to convert the tutorial into Python. I figured at the same time, this would teach me something about Rust, and about reading code in general.

For examplep  precodeenum Selector      SimpleSimpleSelector,   struct SimpleSelector      tagname OptionltStringgt,     id OptionltStringgt,     class VecltStringgt,  codepre  pI gather that an enum is a way of storing data that may be exactly one of several possible types, but I dont see what this means here.p  pAnother thing that shows up in the authors code is for examplep  precodematch self.nextchar       gt          self.consumechar         selector.id  Someself.parseidentifier      codepre  pwhere in this case I have no idea what the term Some does. I have tried looking through the official Rust documentation found at a hrefhttpwww.rustlang.org relnofollowhttpwww.rustlang.orga however, at no point in that documentation can I find a description of these terms, even though Some is used in the documentationp  pSo what do these terms do More generally, where exactly is there a list of Rust keywords, since no google searching of rust programming language keywords seems to be helpingp

Negative 87 pIm rewriting a C code to python but it seems Ive stuck.p  pI have the function in Cp  precode  double GetArrival        generate the next arrival time, with rate 12              static double arrival  START    SelectStream0    arrival  Exponential2.0   return arrival    codepre  pThis function is called from a codemaincode function. As you can see every time it is called, an exponential random rate of 2.0 is added to arrival. All you have to know is that its a custom function that returns a random variable.p  pAfter consulting ddd on the C file which works as it should, I realized that in the following python equivalent the variable codearrivalcode gets initialized to START  0 everytime the function GetArrival is called. This for some reason doesnt happen in the C, except the first time the function is called.p  precodedef GetArrival      arrival  START      SelectStream0      arrival  Exponential2.0      return arrival codepre  pSo I thought I should omit this evil initialization and that should do it. Did not, because in that case I get the following errorp  precodeUnboundLocalError local variable arrival referenced before assignment codepre  pWhich kinda makes sense.p  pSo my question is how can I make the python code work like the one in C, without having the variable codearrivalcode initialize to zero every timep  pThanks.p

Negative 87 pIve been thrown a can it be done in Doctrine type question by my supervisor, and while Ive been able to do some of it with external Mapper objects, Im wondering if there might be any way to fakeout the ORM to do it within Doctrine itself.p  pEssentially, the thing we are interested in doing is cutting down database clutter. We have a number of tables containing distinct properties or item sets in various categories and then a whole bunch of linktables tying them to other properties or item sets. For examplep  pWe have a couple of tables such as Materials and PaperTypes which describe various Material and Paper options for our products. We then group these into MaterialCollections and PaperFamilies respectively. Then there has to be a onetomany link table between MaterialCollectionMaterials and PaperFamiliesPaperTypes respectively. Repeat these types of relationships a couple dozen more times and you see where our DB is starting to clutter up.p  pThe link tables themselves are nothing more than a number of entries including multiple records with the PrimaryId from the parent table collectionsfamilies and uniqueperparent PrimaryIds from the subtable materialspapertypes. Link tables could be named something like MaterialCollectionsMaterials and PaperFamilyPaperTypes for example.p  pThe idea was to get rid of this slew of link tables by using an abstract 3table structure as followsp  pLists consisting of a unique ListId, a ListName and a TypeId Types consisting of a unique TypeId, a TypeName and an EntityName ListXref consisting of ListIds and memberId which points to the primaryId from the Entity designated in the list typep  pMultiple lists can exist for a given type, but the Xref pairs are unique. Different Types can also point to the same Entity. e.g. there may be more than one type of Material list definedp  pThe ListName would be the equivalent of the parent TableNames above and would allow for eliminating two of the tables in those relationships. So the records in MaterialCollections would now instead be records in the List table of TypeName MaterialCollection. The records that would have been in a link table such as MaterialCollectionsMaterials would now instead be pointed to from ListXRef.p  pAs stated, Ive gotten a basic mapper to make this work for rather basic list creation. But what Im wondering is if there is any way to create Entities or things that behave like Doctrine Entities to establish the abstract relationships between a given listlisttype and the table referenced by EntityName and the corresponding memberIdsp  pIn other words, it would be really nice if I had some means by which I could produce something that had the bulk of functionality of a Doctrine Entity which could be retrieved from the Service Manager or something like it that would behave have similar propertiesfunctions like a Doctrine Entity.p  pI tried adding a wrapper object in the Entity tree that my mappers could try to retrieve which was basically an inherited version of the Xref entity with a few alias functions, but it cant be retrieved with the Entity manager.p  pAny help is appreciated.p  pP.S. While it is not a priority at the moment, longer term I also want to really throw a wrench into the works by trying to have some lists be capable of pointing back to the records produced by other lists. So, for example, a List ProductXMaterials of type ProductMaterials might point to some but not all results of MaterialCollections. But Ill worry about this one later.p

Negative 87 pI understand that segment trees can be used to find the sum of sub array of A. And that this can done in Ologn time according to the tutorial a hrefhttpwww.geeksforgeeks.orgsegmenttreeset1sumofgivenrange relnofollowherea.p  pHowever Im not able to prove that the querying time is indeed Ologn. This link and many others say that we can prove that at each level, the maximum number of nodes processed is 4 and so O4logn  Ologn. But how do we prove this, perhaps by contradictionp  pAnd if so, if we were to use segment trees for ranged sum of higher dimensional arrays, how would the proof be extendedp  pFor example, I can think of finding a sub matrix sum by dividing the original matrix into 4 quadrants similar to halving intervals in linear arrays building a quadrant segment tree but the proof eludes me.p

Negative 87 pI have been using SI outbound gateway to call a REST endpoint protected using NTLM Microsoft Dynamics backend. It was simple enough, just configure the HttpComponentsMessageSender credentials to use Apache HttpClients NTCredentials, and it works transparently.p  pNow however theyve gone and protected it with ADFS, which requires oAuth 2.0 authentication. I know Apache HttpClient which is what SI  Rest Template uses at a lower level doesnt support oAuth out of the box, there is no oAuth AuthScheme. There emisem an oAuth 1.0 AuthScheme implemented on oauth.net, but as I said, I need oAuth 2.0.p  pSo I guess what Im asking is, does anyone know of an oAuth 2,0 AuthScheme that can be plugged into Apache HttpClient, for use with SI Or alternatively, would it be possible to somehow plug in a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comapiclientlibraryjavagoogleoauthjavaclient relnofollowGoogles oAuth clientap
Negative 87 pAs per my previous 2 threads  Im new to Jmeter and need to performance test a new web app  I am making progress, but I need a couple of pointers if thats ok.p  pMy Environment JMeter v2.11, JDK 7, Remote Oracle 12 RDBMSp  pThere is a system A that will send 2000 SOAPXML submissions per hour into a receiving system B.  System B will insert a new row to the database table for each new submission, process the requests and populate a status column with a random numeric value once the processing is completesubmissions are approved.  There is no datetimestamp column in the table.p  pI have a requirement that states these A to B submissions need to be approved within 60 seconds.p  pI found another thread couple of threads that were very helpful and Ive taken bits and pieces of these other threads to come up with the followingp  ul liTHREAD GROUP  Threads Count1, Loop Count 2000, Duration3600li liJDBC CONNECTION CONFIGURATIONli liJDBC PREPROCESSOR  select maxrecordid1 from table Variable Name as maxrecordidvar to identify the next submissions record in databaseli liBEANSHELL SAMPLERS  To generate XML submissionli liWHILE Controller   javaScriptstatus1  null li liJDBC SAMPLER  select status from table where recordid  maxrecordidvar Variable Name as statusli ul  pIm hoping the above will be able allow me to be able to determine the response times, however, Im a little lost on how to verify the response times. I submitted a previous thread here for response times, but Dmitri T thanks Dmitri pointed out that for that scenario what I was actually was throughput not response times.br I understand a while controller will execute until found to be false so for my example above, it will run until the status column is not null, but if the above thread objects in my example hierarchy are correct I dont know how to assert the response times  what listeners would I use  I can see a Response Times graph and I can see a Duration Assertion which specifies a time limit for the assertion  but I dont know how to map this to when the status column for the particular row becomes populated and how I can use the time the row is inserted for a start time to compare the two.p  pEssentially  I need to prove all responses are handled within 60 seconds for each XML submission.p  pI hope Ive been clear and concise with my request  many thanks to anyone that can helpp

Negative 87 pIm drawing a curve on an HTML5 canvas and am using alpha transparency to create a glow effect, by drawing a thicker version of the curve underneath with an alpha of less than 1, then drawing a thinner version of the curve on top and Im doing this with several levels of recursion.p  pOkay heres the problem. It works exactly the way I want it to in Chrome, giving a beautiful glow effect. But in Firefox, the alpha doesnt render properly if my browser dimensions are bigger than around 300px in height yes that sounds crazy but it is actually what it is doing for some reason. If I resize my browser to be extremely tiny, then all the sudden the alpha works and I get my awesome glow. Once I make the window a reasonable size, the alpha no longer works so instead of a glowing line I just get a really thick line.

Negative 87 pThere are a couple of posts quoting Microsoft sayingp  blockquote   pThe app must first describe the notifications to be provided and   obtain the users express permission optin, and must provide a   mechanism through which the user can opt out of receiving push   notifications.p blockquote  pI have searched the net for this and cant find this anywhere on the Microsoft site.  All I have found is the followingp  blockquote   pYour app must respect system settings for notifications and remain   functional when they are disabled. This includes the presentation of   ads and notifications to the customer, which must also be consistent   with the customers preferences, whether the notifications are   provided by the Microsoft Push Notification Service MPNS, Windows   Push Notification Service WNS or any other service. If the customer   disables notifications, either on an appspecific or systemwide   basis, your app must remain functional.p blockquote  pSo it seems the may have relaxed the requirement.  Currently the first thing our app asks when its first launched is Would you like to received push notifications  in an message box.  This hurts user experience so we were wondering if we can just leave the optout on the settings page.p  pDoes anybody know if this requirement has been relaxed so that we dont have to explicitly ask it up frontp

Negative 87 pI have a client that is sending params such as age, gender, name and so on. I need to retrieve data from the table based on the params, but first I need to check for the presence of the paramto avoid a null param and therefore an empty result. The params are working as filters, so they can be triggered or they can be left blanck. What I am doing right now isp  precoderetieve  Student.all   unless params[age].nil     retrieve  retrieve.whereage params[age] end    unless params[gender].nil     retrieve  retrieve.wheregender params[gender] end codepre  pand so on for every param I receive. This way I check if the filter has been selected, and if it has I use the selection as a parameter for the query It works, but as Ruby is known for the DRY statement, I am pretty sure someone out there knows a better way for putting this and to make this flexible.

To emphasize, in this situation I am just loading the nodes relations are the next step.p  pBasically there are three methodsp  pi Set a uniqueness constraint for a property, and create all nodes.

Negative 87 pLet us say an Interface MyInterface is present in jar A. jar B implements the interface . Now if I have to use this interface I need to take a dependency on jar A and B . What is the best way to avoid this double dependency  The problem is if you are using gradle you need to specify a version for jar A and jar B. Updating at 2 places is tricky and half of the times I see one of them is updated but not the other. One way I am thinking is implement MyInterface2 on jarB and ask to modify the downstream consumers to use MyInterface2 they can declare dependency only on Jar B. But gradle will do the transitive dependency walk so that they can declare only one version. Any thoughtscomments p  precodegt Jar A lt  public interface MyInterface    public void doSoemthing    gt Jar B lt  public class Impl1 implements MyInterface     public void doSomething    codepre  pThe gradle file for Jar B will look something likep  precodecompilepackagejarAltVersiongt codepre  p Project 1 ltp  precodeMyInterface foo  new Impl1 codepre  pThe gradle file will look something like p  precodecompilepackagejarAltVersiongt  compilepackagejarBltVersiongt codepre  pThe problem I have is I want the gradle to pull in jarA from transitive dependency, but if it is not there I get an compilation error saying that it could not find MyInterface.

I have also managed to move 5 servos sequential and with different speed, but now I want to move them synchronous.p  pMy biggest problem is that I dont get how I should make it happen I have looked around on other servo codes including servo8bit library and tried to find a way. It seems that most of the examples uses compare match ISR to move the servos at the same time, my problem is that I have a 16bit integer that I want to compare.  p  pIs there a way to do some magic so I can use the 8bit compare match ISR with my 16bit integer Or does anyone of you have some other suggestions on how I can move my servos synchronous without using compare match ISRp  pI hope my questions make sensep  pSince I dont really have any code to show yet only flawed attempts without compar match ISR that makes no sense I post the link to my a hrefhttpsgithub.comCrowStudioTinyServoblobmasterTinyServo.c relnofollowTinyServoa code if it helps.p  pEDIT 1p  pHere is the part of the code I mentioned and didnt post the first timep  precodevoid servoMovevoid     uint16t nextPulse  hPulse[0]  timerSetup       16bit setup for counter  for i  0 i lt sizeofservosizeofservo[0] i      if  oTime gt nextPulse ampamp channel lt sizeofservosizeofservo[0]         check if HIGH pulse pos is done              PORTB amp 1 ltlt servo[channel]          if i1 lt sizeofhPulsesizeofhPulse[0]                      nextPulse  hPulse[i1]                   channel           else              channel  0          oTime  0      resets 16bit variable         totoverflow  0       resets totoverflow variable           TIFR  1 ltlt TOV1         clear counter1 overflowflag         TCNT1  0      resets TimerCounter1          for i  0 i lt sizeofservosizeofservo[0] i      if  oTime gt tPulse  nextPulse ampamp channel lt sizeofservosizeofservo[0]            check if LOW pulse period is done                  PORTB  1 ltlt servo[channel]         nextPulse  hPulse[i]         channel              void servoPosSetvolatile uint16t pos[], uint8t size       for i  0 i lt size i               hPulse[i]  pos[i]           int mainvoid         TCCR1  1 ltlt CS12   set TimerCounter1 prescaler to increment every 1 s PCK8  for channel  0 channel lt size channel      DDRB  1 ltlt servo[channel]  sets PB0PB4 as output pins   channel  0  uint16t pos[]  2000, 1500, 1900, 1300, 1700 uint8t size  5  while1                  servoPosSetpos          servoMove    codepre  pEDIT 2p  pThis is an illustration of how I think the code should work img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comTABDp.jpg altenter image description herep  p...but it does notp
Negative 87 pI have created a matrix with row 1 full of strings and 4 other rows with numbers. They are created in a handle class with the object Projekter.p  pSo in the object Projekter row 1, the first value is blank, but the second value is Ole.

Negative 87 pI have a jQuery Mobile App that relies on a popup to run a Time amp Attendance system.

Negative 87 pI am trying to extract data from a binary table in a FITS file using Python and astropy.io. The table contains an events array with over 2 million events. What I want to do is store the TIME values of certain events in an array, so I can then do analysis on that array. The problem I have is that, whereas in fortran using FITSIO the same operation takes maybe a couple of seconds on a much slower processor, the exact same operation in Python using astropy.io is taking several minutes. I would like to know where exactly the bottleneck is, and if there is a more efficient way to access the individual elements in order to determine whether or not to store each time value in the new array. Here is the code I have so farp  precodefrom astropy.io import fits  minenergy0.3 maxenergy0.4 xcen20000 ycen20000 radius50  datafilefits.opendatafile.fits eventsdatafile[EVENTS].data   datafile.close  times[]  for i in rangelenevents     energyevents[PI][i]     if energyltmaxenergy1000         if energygtminenergy1000             xevents[X][i]             yevents[Y][i]             radius2xxcenxxcenyycenyycen             if radius2ltradiusradius                 times.appendevents[TIME][i]  print times codepre  pAny help would be appreciated. I am an ok programmer in other languages, but I have not really had to worry about efficiency in Python before. The reason I have chosen to do this in Python now is that I was using fortran with both FITSIO and PGPLOT, as well as some routines from Numerical Recipes, but the newish fortran compiler I have on this machine cannot be persuaded to produce a properly working program there are some issues of 32 vs. 64bit, etc.. Python seems to have all the functionality I need FITS IO, plotting, etc, but if it takes forever to access the individual elements in a list, I will have to find another solution.p  pThanks very much.p

Negative 87 pWe are implementing PostgreSQL and have also decided to use NodaTime instead of standard .NET DateTime.  PostgreSQL has a timestamp with time zone type, and NodaTime returns a Date and time value with a time zone via the SystemClock.Instance.Now method.  However, the value returned by SystemClock.Instance.Now 20150717T132252Z is not directly writable to the PostgreSQL field.  Is there a best practice for dealing with NodaTimePostgreSQL implementationsp
Negative 87 pI am writing some code right now and I have a placeholder with codematmulcode that seems to be working pretty well, but Id like to use a codeLAPACKcode codedgemmcode implementation. I am only using codegfortrancode right now and getting very good speeds with codematmulcode, but I wonder if I can get better.p  pThe current call isp  precodeC  transposematmul transposeA, B codepre  pwhere codeAcode, codeBcode, and codeCcode are nonsquare, codedouble precisioncode matrices. I can easily write a wrapper for codedgemmcode with the current codegfortrancode implementation of codeLAPACKcode, but I like that I can do this all as a function rather than worrying about codecallcode for a surbroutine and having to deal with the codetransposecode.p  pI am wondering if I compile with codeifortcode and include the codeMKLcode, will this codematmulcode magically change to a codeMKLcode codedgemmcode function for me with no wrapperp

But it doubles work if I wish to change something and it doubles work to test app.p  pThere must be some solution to handle multiple resolutions. But I cant find anything simple that will just selects folder with textures at startup.p

Negative 87 pHow can I determine actual physical RAM used by some processp  pI can look into codeprocPIDstatuscode on codeVmRSScode or into codetopcodes codeREScode column. However, this number is incorrect for the processes which use multiple mappings backed by the same file. For example, the following piece of code maps several areas into a small physical memory window.p  precodesizet windowsize  ...  e.g. 128 MiB sizet totalsize  ...   e.g. 4 TiB  char path[]  devshmwindowXXXXXX  int fd  mkstemppath  ftruncatefd, offtwindowsize  void data  mmapNULL, totalsize, PROTREADPROTWRITE, MAPPRIVATEMAPANONYMOUSMAPNORESERVE, 1, 0  forptrdifft offset  0 offset lt ptrdiffttotalsize offset  windowsize      mmap void  uintptrtdata  offset , windowsize, PROTREADPROTWRITE, MAPFIXEDMAPSHAREDMAPNORESERVE, fd, 0  codepre  pNow, if I look into codeprocPIDstatuscode, the kernel reports codeVmRSScode as a sum of all the windows above. Although this number is even higher than the total physical memory size.p

Negative 87 pI have a couple of divs Id like to either scale down on move the padding up using Javascript and jQuery and this does work....except it doesnt perform the transitionp  precodejQuerywindow.scrollfunction      if jQuerythis.scrollTop gt 200              jQuery.sitetitle.csswidth, 80px, height, 80px         jQuery.mainnavigation.csspadding, 2.25rem 0 0 0         jQuery.searchboxwrapper.csspadding, 2.2rem 0 0 0           ifjQuerythis.scrollTop lt 200             jQuery.sitetitle.csswidth, 160px, height, 160px        jQuery.mainnavigation.csspadding, 4.55rem 0 0 0        jQuery.searchboxwrapper.csspadding, 4.4rem 0 0 0        codepre  pSo Ive added things like transition padding .5s easeinout to the original styles but no animation  transition takes place.

Negative 87 pIm having trouble getting the main feature of my iOS application to work. Im trying to create an app that measure tiny amounts of movement over a period of a few hours using CoreMotion. Now because the iPhone will auto lock after a minute or so I have had to use the M7  M8 motion coprocessors, which if I understand correctly measure a users movement for the last 7 days whether the app is open or not and then can be queried once the app is awake to retrieve and display that data. The issue is that the M7  M8 only seem to gather data for selected movements such as walking, running, cycling etc and I cant figure out how to retrieve much smaller movements from the M7  M8. I know that using a CoreMotion motion manager can check if the device has moved a tiny amount, however I dont know if the M7  M8 record this and can be queried. p  pDoes anyone know how I could retrieve such tiny movements from the M7  M8 motion coprocessorsp

Negative 87 pWhen calling a recursive function with kwargs multiple times, previous values of the kwargs are retained even though they are local variables. p  pThe following code snippet demonstrates the problem. p  precodeusrbinenv python  def countfunccount, messagelist[]     count  1     if count gt 0         messagelist.appendcount         countfunccount, messagelistmessagelist     else         print messagelist         del messagelist         returncount  if name  main     printCall 1     countfunc5     printCall 2     countfunc5     printCall 3     countfunc5     printCall 4     countfunc5 codepre  pThe output is p  pCall 1 [4, 3, 2, 1] p  pCall 2 [4, 3, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1] p  pCall 3 [4, 3, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1] p  pCall 4 [4, 3, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1]p  pI would expect the output for all for calls to bep  p[4, 3, 2, 1]p  pI call countfunc 4 times, each passing no kwargs. The function definition is set to provide an empty list as a default for messagelist if the kwarg is omitted. However, messagelist seems to retain its previous value across all 4 calls of countfunc.  p  pI would expect that local variables in prior calls of countfunc should not influence local variables in subsequent calls. p  pI suspect this has to do with the way Python handles recursion. Passing in an empty list each time I call the function gives the desired result, so I already have a work around.  I would like to understand why this is happening.  Does anyone have insightp

Negative 87 pIm trying to adjust the origin.y value of a UIViews frame.  The problem that Im running into is that the elements arent moving with the frame with negative offsets.  When I give the origin.y a positive value, it works perfectly the view drops down, leaving black above, and the elements shift down as well.  With a negative value, on the other hand, the view moves correctly, leaving black below, but the elements dont change position.  I feel like the problem might be with autolayout, and the elements remaining trapped by the top of the screen, not the top of the UIView.p  pAny ideas on how to fix thisp
