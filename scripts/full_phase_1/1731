Negative 1731 pWe use EJB2.x entity beans with BMP bean managed persistence.  It appears BMP is not supported in EJB3.  We had wanted to stay current and upgrade to EJB3.  Does anyone know if there are in fact any BMP options available in 3.0p  pFrom what I can tell, using 3.0, all entity beans have to use JPA and by definition ORM.  There are some options to use native SQL but that is still just a way to use JPA to implement ORM.p  pI wasnt sure if there is another EJB3 approach to achieve the same functionality as with EJB2.x BMP entity beans.  We currently use the standard ejbStore method to update the DB through native SQL and the ejbLoad method to lookup all beans and to refresh the bean in the event of a transaction rollback.  I thought you might be able to do this with EJB3 session beans but I wasnt sure.p  pPerhaps instead of migrating to EJB3 beans we should migrate to Spring.p

Negative 1731 pIn my continuing journey through ASP.NET MVC, I am now at the point where I need to render an editcreate form for an entity.p  pMy entity consists of enums and a few other models, created in a repository via LINQtoSQL.p  pWhat I am struggling with right now is finding a decent way to render the editcreate forms which will contain a few dropdown lists and a number of text fields.  I realize this may not be the most userfriendly approach, but it is what I am going with right now .p  pI have a repository layer and a business layer.  The controllers interface with the service layer.  p  pIs it best to simply create a viewmodel like sop  precodepublic class EventFormViewModel      IEventService eventService      public IEvent Event  get private set       public IEnumerableltEventCampaigngt Campaigns  get private set      public IEnumerableltSelectListItemgt Statuses  get private set       Other tablesdropdowns go here       Constructor     public EventFormViewModelIEventService eventService, IEvent ev              eventService  eventService         Event  ev           Initialize Collections         Campaigns  eventService.getCampaigns.ToSelectList extn method maybe         Statuses  eventService.getStatus.ToSelectList  extn for each table type      codepre  pSo this will give me a new EventFormViewModel which Ill bind to a view.  But is this the best way  Id essentially be pulling all data back from the database for a few different tables and converting them to an IEnumerable.  This doesnt seem overly efficient, but I suppose I could cache the contents of the dropdowns.p  pAlso, if all I have is methods that get data for a dropdown, should I just skip the service layer and go right to the repositoryp  pThe last part of my question  For the ToSelectList extension method, would it be possible to write one method for each table and use it generically even if some tables have different columns Id and Name versus Id and CampaignName.p  pForgive me if this is too general, Im just trying to avoid going down a deadend road  or one that will have a lot of potholes.p

Negative 1731 pI have a form with a textarea that can contain large amounts of content say, articles for a blog edited using one of a number of third party rich text editors. Im trying to implement something like an autosave feature, which should submit the content through ajax if its changed. However, I have to work around the fact that some of the editors I have as options dont support an isdirty flag, or an onchange event which I can use to see if the content has changed since the last save.p  pSo, as a workaround, what Id like to do is keep a copy of the content in a variable lets call it lastSaveContent, as of the last save, and compare it with the current text when the autosave function fires on a timer to see if its different. However, Im worried about how much memory that could take up with very large documents.p  pWould it be more efficient to store some sort of hash in the lastSaveContent variable, instead of the entire string, and then compare the hash values If so, can you recommend a good javascript libraryjquery plugin that implements an appropriate hash for this requirementp

Negative 1731 pIm using PHPs SwiftMailer library to bulk send emails following CANSPAM and RFCs.p  pEverything works fine until I run across a domain that does not have a corresponding MX entry in the DNS.  At that point, my script just hangs  Im assuming its because sendmail hasnt returned.  This can last just a few minutes, or it can last many hours.p  pI have confirmed that the addresses my script slash sendmail hang on are those without a DNS MX entry.  Everything else sends fine.p  pIs there a way I can check if the DNS MX exists inside of PHP before I attempt to send the message  Is this scalable i.e., will that extra lookup on the DNS really slow me down, or will it be fine bc then the MX is cached locally for sendmail to use in delivering the messagep  pThanks for your helpp  p UPDATE  I tried the solutions below, which helped me narrow down what the problem is.  It seems its not a question of whether or not the MX entry exists.  The problem is that the DNS lookup is taking forever to return.

I attempted to solve this by setting the textFormat combobox to RichText and then set the textFormat field to be msuper 2 however, when previewing my dialog, the text is taken literally and not as RichText and thus there is no superscript 2 but instead the super 2 with the backslash removed.  I also tried escaping the backslash with super 2 but I then the literal super 2 when previewing the dialog.p  pHow can I specify the superscript to Qt Creator so that my dialog preview shows the superscripted 2p  pHere is how I want it to look msup2supp

Negative 1731 pIn Native API Microsoft exports two versions of each api call, one prefixed with Zw and one with Nt, for eg.

Negative 1731 pHi weve been getting an issue in which WCM references are being generated  towards protected content for anonymousunauthenticated users. In WCM this  basically means that the links have a myconnect protected context instead of a connect unprotected context in their URL.p  pNow WAS has a functionality in which if a user generates a request towards a protected resource while being unauthenticated WAS places the URL to that  resource in a cookie called WASReqURL, and when the user authenticates it  redirects the user to that URL. In my case our users are getting redirected  to an image resource or a file resource, etc. This changes depending what is the last requested protected item and whats in the cache, etc.p  pNow Ive checked permissions on the libraries, sites, content items, components,  etc, but that still doesnt help. And the worst thing is that this issue is  intermittent almost as if it was tied to some sort of performance issue.p  pThank youp

I plan on using the directional keys leftright to follow the puck from zone to each.  Each time the puck changes to a zone, I want to close the active record and start a new one.  The start and end times will let me calculate how long the puck was in the zone.  I also need a way to stop the creation of a new record for things like faceoffs, tv time outs, and end of period.  I was planning on using the spacebar.  My thought is that if I do this correctly, when I follow along, the times recorded should match up with what is posted on the game clock found on tv.

Negative 1731 pIm just starting out learning about TCPIP.  p  pI have written a simple TCPIP server which listens on port 3000 and spawns a thread when a connection is received.  That new thread sits and reads data.  My client application creates 100 connections to this server, and, using the tread pool, each connection gets a chance to send a unique message to the server.  p  pThe server doesnt respond to the message  it only prints it to the screen.  So, the thing I am seeing is the listening thread in the server will sometimes read messages from several different clients in the same read.  p  pI was under the impression that TCP would separate each message to allow each thread in the server to read the message sent to it, not to all others as well.  Am I mistaken in my understanding, or do I have something else going on in my codep

Negative 1731 pstrongSummary tldrstrong Were trying to set up a queue with codePeekcode access but not codeReceivecode access for testing purposes so a codeReceivecode request will fail but a codePeekcode will succeed, but it seems MSFT has made that more difficult than anticipated.p  pstrongBackgroundstrong We have a local private MSMQ queue from which one process receives and processes consumes messages. In some situations the processing cant be completed and the message stays in the queue e.g. forwarding destination temporarily offline. A monitor was therefore added to peek at the queue every 10 minutes and see if the message at the top is the same or not  if the consumer is stalled the same message is at the top, the monitor triggers an alarm to indicate that somethings wrong.p  pTo force the queues to stall for testing purposes to make sure the monitor function works, we thought wed just remove but not emdenyem codeReceivecode permissions from the queue itself but still emallowem codePeekcode restarting MSMQ and everything to enforce new permissions, which would ideally allow the monitor to codePeekcode the messages without allowing anyone to codeReceivecode remove the messages, stalling the queue and generating an alarm.p  pWhile testing this scenario out, however, I ran into an exception that seems to foil this approachp  precodeSystem.Messaging.MessageQueueException Access to Message Queuing system is denied.    at System.Messaging.MessageQueue.MQCacheableInfo.getReadHandle    at System.Messaging.MessageQueue.StaleSafeReceiveMessageUInt32 timeout, Int32 action, MQPROPS properties, NativeOverlapped overlapped, ReceiveCallback receiveCallback, CursorHandle cursorHandle, IntPtr transaction    at System.Messaging.MessageQueue.ReceiveCurrentTimeSpan timeout, Int32 action, CursorHandle cursor, MessagePropertyFilter filter, MessageQueueTransaction internalTransaction, MessageQueueTransactionType transactionType    at System.Messaging.MessageQueue.PeekTimeSpan timeout codepre  pThis indicates to me at least that codePeekcode internally calls codeReceiveCurrentcode and must try a transactional codeReceivecode that it will then roll back abort after its done getting the message. Firing up .NET Reflector, I found that all instances of codePeekcode call some variant of codeReceivecode, so a different codePeekcode wont help.  So it seems like codeReceivecode permissions are emrequiredem in order to codePeekcode as well, which seems kind of dumb as far as queue design goes.p  pNote that both the consumer and monitor use the same account permissions and changing the monitoring emmethodem using codePeekcode isnt a viable option at this point as that would require significant changes to requirements, specifications, and production code that would cost more than its worth though I guess you could propose monitoring methodology changes anyways if you really have to as they might be useful to others if they run into the same thing.p  pstrongFinally, the Questionstrong Is there a better or even just different p way to codePeekcode at the top of the queue without needing codeReceivecode permissions Or a different way to set the permissions via permissions interface, via code, etc. such that codeReceivecode itself fails but codeReceiveCurrentcode and other methods required to codePeekcode workp
Negative 1731 pI am new to MVC so this question may be naivep  pI know you can add validation attributes to model properties and the framework will provide appropriate server side and client side validation.However I am forced to use a legacy database structure where one of the properties in the model is either int or string  and the other propertyValue data type is determined by the first property.This means that I cannot use Annotations for validation. But is there any simple way of programatically annotating the properties after values are fetched from the database and the model class is constructed.If this can be done then it will do effective client Side validation without much hassle. thanksp

Negative 1731 pI want to set a class attribute when my Rails app starts up. It requires inspecting some routes, so the routes need to be loaded before my custom code runs.

Unfortunately using codetopreparecode alone doesnt seem to work in test mode, hence the duplication.p  pIm curious why the routes are loaded before afterinitialize in test mode, but not in development mode.

I guess I could do the same thing with code in lib but Im not sure if thats right either.p  pAnother option is to just apply mus suggestion on toprepare. That works but there seems to be a noticeable delay reloading the routes on every request in my dev environment, so Im not sure if this is a good call, although its DRY, at least.p  precodeconfig.toprepare do   Rails.application.reloadroutes   User.invalidusernames  Rails.application.routes.routes.mapamppath.joinn.scansw.flatten.compact.uniq end codepre

Negative 1731 pI have a Seam 2.2 based Java EE 5 web application with a bunch of tables mapped to JPA 1.0 Entities via Hibernate 3.3.3.

So I did the followingp  ul licreate schema codemyschemaappcodeli ligrant object rights on all necessary tables from codemyschemacode both regular ones and nm intermediate tables and sequences depending on the usage one or more of codeselectcode, codeinsertcode, codeupdatecode, codedeletecode to codemyschemaappcodeli lideclare private synonyms in codemyschemaappcode in order to use the same names than before and hiding the other schemas name prefixli lichange property codehibernate.defaultschemacode to new schema name in codepersistence.xmlcodeli lichange userpassword in Tomcats datasource definition in codecontext.xmlcodeli ul  pWhen I start the application while having codehibernate.hbm2ddl.autocodeset to codevalidatecode, I get an exception when the framework tries to create the codeEntityManagerFactorycode telling me that a table is missing. When I execute a select statement directly in an sql tool with codemyschemaappcode connected, everything works fine.p  pI understood that using a synonym going on another table is transparent for the application.

Negative 1731 pAs you know codemmapcode and codemalloccode are nondeterministic on a system with Address Space Layout Randomization. To make my memory allocation deterministic, I use codemmapcode to reserve a very large address space on a 64 bit system with no swap space, that is, using MAPNORESERVE. Then as I require memory, I assign 10 MB of space by doing codemmapcode with MAXFIXED within that address space range. Therefore, the memory allocated grows linearly. p  pWhen I need to codefreecode memory, I just unmap it using use codemunmapcode. Moreover, I dont reutilize the address space which has been unmapped, but keep on allocating ahead. I guess this doesnt really affect anything as my address space allocated with codemmapcode with MAPNORESERVE is very large anyway.p  pNow, the question is, how good a memory allocator is this. It ofcourse isnt a very smart one, as it cannot allocate small chunks of memories, as through codemmapcode you allocate at least 4096 bytes of memory, but I guess its still quite a workable solution. What do you thinkp  pAlso, what for the case where a process allocates memory of factor 4096 only. In that scenario, I think this approach wouldnt be inferior to codemalloccode.p  h2EDITh2  pNote that Im talking about determinism with respect of two identical redundant processes. One is forked from another, so it gets the initial address of the mmaped region with MAPNORESERVE, as I do codeforkcode afterwards.p
Negative 1731 pIm pulling my hair trying to figure out when a serial port finishes closing so I can reopen it. It turns out that codeCloseHandlecode returns before the port is actually unlocked.p  pI am opening a serial port using codeCreateFileFILEFLAGOVERLAPPEDcode, associating it with a CompletionPort using codeCreateIoCompletionPortcode, readingwriting to it using codeReadFilecode, codeWriteFilecode and closing it using codeCloseHandlecode.p  pIve noticed that if I close and reopen a serial port quickly enough, I get an codeERRORACCESSDENIEDcode back from codeCreateFilecode. This is happening in spite of the fact that Im waiting for codeCloseHandlecode to return, then waiting for all outstanding readwrite operations associated with that handle to come back from the completion port. Surely there is a better way p  pstrongHow do I close a serial port synchronouslystrong Please no retry loops, sleep or some other cheap hacks.p  pstrongEDITstrong Maybe this has something to do with my use of completion ports and FILEFLAGOVERLAPPED. I get a callback when the readwrite operations complete. Is there some sort of callback for the port closingp

MBR mbr     BuildMBR mbr       ... here I loop all the partitions found...     for each partition               IPartition part  mpFactories[ mbr.GetPartType ]gtBuild mbr.PartPosition          ..and store each partition somewhere       codepre  pThe point is I have lots of partition types  100, and in most of cases, the user will only have two or three different types of partitions in the HD. So it seems like a waste of time and memory to allocate all the factories and not using most of them. I think that a lazy initialization would be much better here, but then I would need somewhere a code likep  precode    switch mbr.GetPartType           case PARTNTFS         if  mpFactories[ PARTNTFS ]  NULL              mpFactories[PARTNTFS]  new FactoryNTFS         break             case PARTFAT32         if  mpFactories[ PART32 ]  NULL              mpFactories[PART32]  new Factory32         break             ...      codepre  pp  pAnd that very long switchcase would add too much ciclomatic complexity to the code even the code being easy to understand.p  pSo, is there a better solution for the problem, that can avoid the very long switchcase and that does not waste resourcesp

The virtual attribute would provide the strongmember status historystrong object that I wanted to display, and then when the user submitted the updated strongmemberstrong and strongmember status historystrong, I could run some business logic on the virtual attribute using beforesave and update the memberstatushistories field as needed.p  pAgain, I have been unable to get any approach to work so I am open to suggestions on how to accomplish this.

Now Firearms and Bullets are both resources.  Firearms can use many kinds of bullets, FMJ,HP,P,Explosive... Bullets can also be used in a variety of firearms AK,M60,M14.  So I would also like to ensure that if a Bullet is no longer available, the aforementioned Firearm relationship would no longer exists, and viceversa.p  pHopefully my fantasy example of perk earning Warlords paints a clear picture.p  pResources are abstract. Though they exist in the datastore for constraint purposes, I would never instantiate a generic resource. And I could have many more types henchmen, helicopters, werewolves,... each with quite different attributes. They exist in the first case to avoid a polymorphic foreign key situation with the ChoicesEarned. p  pYou will notice that Resource Type 2 does not contain a codeSetltType1gtcode, but merely the reference to the codeLongResourceIdcode of some Firearm. Bullets cannot hold firearms, even if the reverse is true, and for sake of argument, yes these magical guns can shoot many types of bullets. p  pWhy do I have collections of IDs, not objects Well If I add a type of bullet, it seems more efficient to add an Id reference to an association table than to retrieve the firearm and add a bullet object to it. That way too, when I retrieve a firearm object, I dont also retrieve all of the bullets it could possibly use. Less memory overhead for all those objects, instead just a bunch of Ids.p  pemstrongSo what was the questionemstrongp  p1. This doesnt seem like an uncommon pattern.

Negative 1731 pI was trying to do a Vigenere cipher program in java, and I encountered some problem with the encryptiondecryption part of the code. I know how I should go about approaching the encryptiondecryption, but I am having trouble putting that into code. p  pLet me start off by explaining the projectp  pFor this project, I am creating a cipher program Vigenere cipher is different than caesar cipher in that Vigenere allows the key to be a word rather than just a letter or number that first prompt the user if heshe wants to encrypt or decrypt a message. Once the user makes the selection, the program prompts the user for a key. the key has to be lower case, and a word, not symbols or numbers. Then the program will ask the user for an input file that contains the message the user wants to decrypt or encrypt. Afterward, the program prompts the user for an output file name and store the decryptedencrypted message in that file. p  pSo lets say the message is Meet at 567 and the key is cats,  and the user want to encrypt the message, the output should end up like Oexl ct 567p  pThe encryptLinedecryptLine method of my code only needs to encryptdecrypt one line of text. the other parts of my code will take care of other lines.  For the code that I have done so far, the decryptLine is completely wrong, right now, I just want to focus on the encryptLine. Once I figure that out, figuring out the decryptLine shouldnt be so hard. In the following, I have post comments in my encryptLine method as to what I am trying to do. The encryption works, it just has trouble when it encounter a space or symbols such as amp. I know it has a lot of redundant code, but it is the best things I could come up with since I am new at this. p  pThank you in advance for your helpp

Negative 1731 pWe are moving a web app over to Azure and would like some feedback on our strategy. Azure is new to us and so we want to make sure that we are going down the right path.  Note that were using VS 2010.p  pOur current app has two parts  1 a standard web app for the user interface and 2 a windows app that runs on the server.  The windows app wakes up every 2 minutes, looks for any new records in a SQL table, processes them and then sleeps.  The windows app also tells us the number of records processed, processing time, etc so that we can see the general health of the system.  Both apps readwrite files stored on the server.  Yes, this should probably be a service but we wanted the interface so we can quickly see overall health.  We have a service that checks to make sure the interface is running and restarts it if theres a failure.p  pPorting the web app to Azure is straight forward and weve done some testing on it within VS without any problems.  We need some advice on the windows app and setting upaccessing the files.p  pHeres our strategy.  All advice is appreciated.p  p1  Create a worker role for the windows app.  2  Set this worker role as the startup project. 3  The worker role will create the Azure cloud drive for file access and pass the drive letter to the web app.  Well establish the connection within onstart. 4  Make certain that the worker role is persistent so that we dont lose the cloud drive.  p  pTwo additional questions  p  p1  It appears that a worker role can have a user interface but perhaps were misreading something.  If we attempt to add the windows app to the solution we receive a number of errors.  We also tried to create a worker role and set it as a Windows Form Application but that immediately produced an error about their being no Main method which was a warning flag to us that we shouldnt be doing this.  What are we missing herep  p2  If the worker role is set as the startup project, will it need to start the web app or will that start automatically once the worker role has completed its startup processingp

Negative 1731 pI have a problem with a jQuery Mobile listview not refreshing, however only in one extremely particular instance. The issue occurs when Im testing my app on an android phone specifically a Google Nexus. The issue occurs after my listview loads properly from view 1 to view 2. I then go to view 3. When I go from view 3 to view 2 the listview does not entirely load. What I mean by this is that it does actually load my code properly, however it is never displayed until I attempt to select one of the rows. Once I select one of the rows they all suddenly appear. I am creating my listview by appending html with javascript in codedocument.readycode. I know this is said to be bad practice currently, however when I use the jQuery suggested method of codedocument.bindpageinitcode it will work from 3 to 2 however everytime I leave view 2 codedocument.bindpageinitcode is fired again. Is there anyway around this Thanksp

Negative 1731 pI am in a pretty uncommon situation. I am residing in one of the most undeveloped parts of the world, and I need to have some people fill out a form.

I would have liked to have the results send to a .php page, which would then insert the results in a MySQL database, but that is simply not possible.p  pSo I chose to use a LibreOffice database. Does anyone know how of a simple way to convert these email form results into the LibreOffice databasep  pMy email client automatically puts the results in a seperate mailboxfolder. I am using Thunderbird on Linux.p  pI think I can write a script to extract the results from the email bodies, but I do not know how to insert them into the LibreOffice Base via a BashPythonPerl.. script.p  pAny help or ideas would be greatly appreciated. If you have a totally different idea for a setup of this questionairesurvey, ideas are also welcome but remember, no www, no phpserver, no web server, no MySQL server, everything is email here.p

Negative 1731 pMy question concerns modern browser optimization through function inlining. I think I really need someone who is familiar with the V8, JavaScriptCore, andor SpiderMonkey codebase to answer this question or at least someone knowledgeable in modern browser approaches to optimization.p  pBasically I want to know if theres any way to predict when function inlining will be used and how to leverage it for optimizing performance with minimal code duplication.p  pLets take the following simple function from a hrefhttpjoijs.com relnofollowjoia tempo as an examplep  precodefunction limitf, max      var count  0, isFunction  typeof max  function     ifisFunction max  max gtgtgt 0  1     return function limitedFunction          ifisFunction  maxcount  count gt max return         count         return f.applythis, arguments       codepre  pThis function takes a function codefcode and returns a wrapper function which limits the number of times the original function can be called through the wrapper. Examplep  precodevar foo  limitfunction  console.logfoo , 3 foo  logs foo foo  logs foo foo  logs foo foo  doesnt log anything foo  doesnt log anything codepre  pIt also accepts a function which returns codetruecode or codefalsecode as its second argument instead of a numberp  precodevar bar  limit     function  console.logbar ,     function  return Math.random gt 0.5  true  false   bar  randomly logs bar or doesnt log anything bar  randomly logs bar or doesnt log anything bar  randomly logs bar or doesnt log anything codepre  pThis is an overly simplistic, trivial example, so bear with me. I think there are real applications for this in nontrivial cases, but I want to use an easy case to get to the root of how the browser does or can do inlining.p  pOne way to rewrite this function which could probably be very slightly improved for performance I imagine would be to separate the returned codefunctioncode into two cases, one where codemaxcode is a function and the other where codemaxcode is a numberp  precodefunction limitf, max      var count  0, isFunction  typeof max  function     ifisFunction max  max gtgtgt 0  1     return isFunction          function limitedFunctionA              ifmaxcount return             count             return f.applythis, arguments                   function limitedFunctionB              ifcount gt max return             count             return f.applythis, arguments           codepre  pThis way the check to see if codeisFunctioncode is codetruecode or codefalsecode doesnt have to occur emevery timeem codelimitedFunctioncode is called but only once when it is determined whether to return codelimitedFunctionAcode or codelimitedFunctionBcode.  However, this is not ideal because there is some redundant code.p  pMy question concerns the following rewritep  precodefunction limitf, max      var count  0, isFunction  typeof max  function,         check  isFunction              function  return maxcount               function  return count gt max      ifisFunction max  max gtgtgt 0  1     return function limitedFunction          ifcheck return         count         return f.applythis, arguments       codepre  pSo heres my question... strongWill modern browsers be smart enough to turnstrongp  precodeifcheck return codepre  pstrongintostrongp  precodeifmaxcount return codepre  pstrongwhen codeisFunctioncode is true, andstrongp  precodeifcount gt max return codepre  pstrongwhen codeisFunctioncode is falsestrong ... preventing the need to call the extra codecheckcode function, throwing an extra function onto the stack unnecessarily each time.p

Negative 1731 pMy thinking was that Symfony2 would extend the codeExpireAtcode on each page request made during the authenticated session. So if the timeout was 100 seconds and you made a page request, the new codeExpireAtcode would be codetime  100code. This use it or lose it authentication functionality is similar to what you get on a banking website.  p  pThe default functionality seems to be when the session timeout is set to code100code in the codeconfig.ymlcode, the user only has 100 seconds to do what they can.  p  pI dont think this will be to hard to implement but where should it be done My first guess is in the codeisEqualTocode method. Once you can determine the user is authentic you can reup their codeexpireAtcode. Or does the cookie need to be modifiedp

Negative 1731 pI have trouble to solve a scope issue. Actually Im working on a project for an HMI browser frontend. Its should visualise variables from an automation system. For the HMI its required that the user can switch between different pages. To solve the general process flow I have created a state machine function, which coordinates loading, drawing and interaction with user. My problem now is that I use setTimeout to call the run function which is actually my state machine and now run in trouble with varscope.p  pLook at following codep  precodefunction frontend      Public properties   this.soundEnable  true     Private Properties   var p1  0   var p2  [1,2,3]   var p3  a1, b2, c3   var runState  1   var runWait  false     Public Methods     stops the state machine until mcontinue is called   this.mwait  function      runWait  true        continues the state machine   this.mcontinue  function      if runWait        runWait  false       setTimeoutrun, 100             Private Methods    function drawFramefinishcallback      ...ltDrawing of HMIObjects on the canvasgt...     finishcallback       function run      switch runState      case 1       this.mstop       drawFramethis.mcontinue     case 2       fori0 iltp3.length i          p2.pushexternalObjectCreatorp3[i]                 if runWait        runState       setTimeoutrun, 100             Constructor   ...ltcode to assign public and private propertiesgt...     Finally call the state machine to activate the frontend   runState  1   run  codepre  pProblem is scope in runFunction. In case of the first call from end of constructor everything is ok. run can access all the private properties and manipulate them. But when it is called later on via setTimeout from mcontinue or by itself I cant access the private properties. In firebug I can just see the public properties and functions and none of the private properties I need.p  pUsing of global variables will help, but is not possible, because on multi monitor solution I have 2 separated canvas objects which need to show a separated version of the HMI  for that case I need 2 instances of frontend running parallel in one browser window.p  pDoes anyone know a solution for that problem  Im on the end of my knowledge and totally confused.p

That seems quite inefficient. Im not sure about Pouchdbs view technology. The view is created and used at query time so I guess that Pouchdb isnt really applying the map to create an index. I suppose this is like a temp view in Couchdb so the efficiency isnt there perhaps. p  pSome expert opinion would be greatly appreciated.p  pThanks, Mattp
Negative 1731 pI am creating web scraping with php and curl. I look that if the status code of http respond is 3xx, curl still download the body content. If the body content is small I think this is no problem, but In my case there are pages with 3xx and huge body content. I just want to redirect immediately if it got 3xx without getting the body content. How to do thatp

Negative 1731 pThis question has been asked previously but not recently and not with a clear answer.p  pUsing Socket.io, is there a maximum number of concurrent connections that one can maintain before you need to add another server p  pDoes anyone know of any active production environments that are using websockets particularly socket.io on a massive scale Id really like to know what sort of setup is best for maximum connectionsp  pBecause Websockets are built on top of TCP, my understanding is that unless ports are shared between connections you are going to be bound by the 64K port limit.

Negative 1731 pSo i dont have any idea about how I can scrape the underlying text of a paragraph from a website page, Which does not have any id or class using php. One of the way is to count and iterate through the p tags in a , but the div itself gets closed before any p tags are encountered. I intend to scrape wikitravel.org info in order to learn scraping. Here is one of the example of the page source of wikitravel.orgp  precode   lth2gtltspan classeditsectiongt[lta hrefwikienindex.phptitleKanniyakumariamp    ampactioneditampampsection18 titleEdit section Sleepgteditltagt][lta hrefSleep titleclick to add a sleep listing onclickaddListingthis, 18, sleep, Kanniyakumarigtadd listingltagt]ltspangt ltspan classmwheadline idSleepgtSleepltspangtlth2gt     ltpgtThere are numerous hotels, residencies etc. in and around Kanyakumari and therefore, staying over is not be a problem. But there are agents, touts and brokers in every nook and corner looking for unsuspecting tourists. Eschew buying or booking rooms from them, as many a time you end up paying a lot more than the actual price. Vivekananda Kendra can be a good option for people looking for a decent, yet cheap accommodation, but its around 3 km from Kanyakumari. Prefer hotels near the beach especially if you want to watch the sunrise right out of your bed Note that, you should quote this preference when booking the room or else, youll always be given a room without a window opening out to the sea. Moreover many a times, these rooms are in great demand and youll find yourself shelling a extra 400  500 Rs 10 USfor such a room. Hotel Sea View, Hotel Sangam and a couple of other hotels offer such rooms and the rent is about Rs. 1100  25 US for 12 hrs. Note that many rooms are priced for 12 hrs  and not per day especially during the peak season. ltpgt  ltpgtATMs in Kanyakumariltpgt   ltpgtCanara Bank   Main Road, Kanyakumari 629702, ,  ltpgt  ltpgtIndian Bank    S No 658  1, National High Way Opp St AntonyS Higher Secondary Sckanyakumari 629702  ltpgt ltpgtState Bank Of Travancore  P.B.No.1, 117 Amman Sannathi Street, Kanyakumari, Tamil Nadu, 629702 ltpgt codepre  pcan anybody help thanks in advance p

Negative 1731 pIm working on a Windows Form Application in which I have embedded a Windows Media Player that lets you play video files. The unique thing is that I have changed the extension of the media files for reasons which I cant get into here.  For instance, xyz.wmv might be called xyz.ext.  They play just fine, but before they play, I get the messagep  pThe file you are attempting to play has an extension that does not match the file format. Playing the file may result in unexpected behaviour. Do you want the Player to try to play the filep  pYou can click yes and you can even check the box to not show that message again, but I dont want that for all the obvious reasons including the fact that it confuses users.  I have looked into the .settings properties but I cannot find a way to suppress this message and more importantly other messages that might come up.p

Negative 1731 pSo, Ive been working on this .OBJ.MTL mesh parser for the past week and a half.

After some unit tests, it appears to be working fine. p  pSo, I thought it may be a Linux nVidia driver issue. I updated the driver to the next version, restarted, and still no dice.p  pAfter some heavy thinking, Ive been trying to find errors in the following code.p  precode             every 3 vertices should represent a triangle, therefore well want to              use the indices to grab their corresponding vertices.

Negative 1731 pI want to have a persistent button in the bottom right corner of my app.  During all view transitions, the button should remain static.  Im having trouble deciding what view to add the button to.  I know the button ought to be stored in the AppDelegate, but I dont know what other view it would be sense to add it to except the window.  One downside of adding it to the window is that when theres an app running in the background ie Phone, the added status bar padding will push down the window.  In general, adding it to the window seems to be a hacky solution  any thoughtsp

Negative 1731 pHi I am new to iphone Application Development, but this question is more of coding related.I am using a tableview to display users nametextLabel with phoneNumbersdetailtextLabel using Addressbook of course. I have stored both of them in separate arrays. Also, I have an email addresses stored in a separate array. and using all this I am successfully able to display the contacts in sorted order in the table view created. The problem comes in the implementation of searchDisplayController. Here I want to be able to search by users name and emailideither. p  pSo, I am using an NSDictionary to store nameemail as a value NSString format with keys as the index of the row on which it is displaying that contact. Now I am successfully getting an array of all the matching contacts using the following code.p  precode voidfilterContentForSearchTextNSStringsearchText scopeNSStringscope  NSPredicate resultPredicate  [NSPredicate                                 predicateWithFormatSELF contains[cd] ,                                 searchText]  searchResults   nil matchingContacts  nil NSArray allContactValues  [allContactNamesWithEmailIDs allValues] searchResults  bridge CFArrayRef[[allContactValues sortedArrayUsingSelectorselectorcaseInsensitiveCompare] filteredArrayUsingPredicateresultPredicate] matchingContacts   [[NSMutableArray alloc] initWithArraybridge NSMutableArraysearchResults] codepre  pThe matchingContacts gives back the array of all the matching contact Names. all But using this has a drawback when there are two users with same namesame value bt different keys, I could not trace it back to different keys. It is display the same names with same phoneNumbers twice which would be a problem.p  pThe code creating the cells is as followsp  precode UITableViewCell tableViewUITableView tableView cellForRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath     static NSString CellIdentifier  Cell  UITableViewCell cell  [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifierCellIdentifier] if cell  nil      cell  [[UITableViewCell alloc] initWithStyleUITableViewCellStyleSubtitle reuseIdentifierCellIdentifier]       iftableView  self.searchDisplayController.searchResultsTableView          if farmMarkets.countgt0              destIndex  [[[allContactNamesWithEmailID allValues] sortedArrayUsingSelectorselectorcaseInsensitiveCompare] indexOfObjectmatchingContacts[indexPath.row]]   I believe this is what needs to be modified to display multiple contacts. Just dont know how.              [cell.textLabel setTextfarmMarkets[destIndex]]              if destIndexlt0                  [cell.detailTextLabel setText]                          else                 [cell.detailTextLabel setTextphoneNumbersArray[destIndex]]                             codepre  pp  pCan someone give me an example with code, explaining how this should be better implemented All ideas will be helpful. In an all I will summarise it now. I want to implement a tableView displaying contacts with Name and phone Number and a search bar at the top. And when i search using either name or email ID it should display the names with corresponding phone Number.p

Negative 1731 pI am working on a webapp with two input fields in the lower half of the screen.  The parent view is positioned absolutely to the screen.

This small library lets you save a HTML5 canvas element as an image file. This code is working on my page and I am able to save the canvas element.  p  pThe problem I was having was that the axis labels were not part of the canvas, and were therefore not being saved as part of the image.

Negative 1731 pokay. Im reading through C for dummies, and Im at the point where theyre discussing Object Orientation. Ive all but copied the code from the book after trying, and failing, to write the code from concepts Ive learned.

Ive created the enumerated variables called Color and Pentype, and have put separate options for each. This seems to be the problem. I assign the values for the objects, but for some reason when I cout the assigned values, they are returning the numerical array locations of each of the values, instead of their actual values. here is the codep  ppen.h header filep  precodeifndef PENHINCLUDED define PENHINCLUDED  using namespace std  enum Color      red,     blue,     yellow,     green,     black,     gray   enum PenType      ballpoint,     fountain,     felttip,     flammable   class Pen  public     Color InkColor     Color ShellColor     Color CapColor     PenType PenType     double length     double inklevel     string brand      void writestring words         ifinklevel lt 0             cout ltlt UhOh, youre out of ink ltlt endl          else              cout ltlt words ltlt endl             inklevel  words.length                     void explode         cout ltlt You used explosive ink, the tip became heated via friction with the paper ltlt endl ltlt  and the pen exploded, killing you and your family... ltlt endl         inklevel  0         endif  PENHINCLUDED codepre  pmain.cpp file p  precodeincludeltiostreamgt includeltstringgt include pen.h  using namespace std  extern void explode  int main      string inpt     Pen GoodPen     Pen BadPen         GoodPen.brand  OfficeDepot     GoodPen.CapColor  black     GoodPen.InkColor  gray     GoodPen.ShellColor  gray     GoodPen.PenType  ballpoint     GoodPen.length  6             inches     GoodPen.inklevel  100         percent      BadPen.brand  Staples     BadPen.CapColor  red     BadPen.InkColor  red     BadPen.ShellColor  red     BadPen.PenType  flammable     BadPen.length  6.66           inches     BadPen.inklevel  100          percent      cout ltlt You have a choice black pen or red pen.

Negative 1731 pI am a complete newbie to programming and Java.

Negative 1731 pIm trying to create a pintrestlike layout of images. The general idea is to use columncount in css to achieve this a hrefhttpcssdeck.comlabscssonlypintereststylecolumnslayout relnofollowlike in this examplea.p  pI have three columns with a bunch of images, the css and html is identical to that in the link. The problem is that the columns wont align properly. The rightmost column is often much shorter than the others. Obviously the columns will never align perfectly unless the images are the same size, but the difference is much larger than that. Sometimes the first two column will hold ten images each but the third column is holding only two with the images being similar sizes, meaning you could easily have moved a few image from the first and second column to the third to get a better alignment. This result seems to go against the idea of columncount.p  pThis also happens in the link above if you change some of the images to much smaller images. Is it simply columncount that is still buggy and shouldnt be used, or is there some trick to stop this from happeningp  pEdit Here is the basic css minus lots of basic styling like transitions and stuff, which I have tried to remove to see if they where the culprit.p  precodewrapper      width 90     maxwidth 1100px     minwidth 800px     margin 50px auto   columns      webkitcolumncount 4     webkitcolumngap 10px     webkitcolumnfill auto     mozcolumncount 4     mozcolumngap 10px     mozcolumnfill auto     columncount 4     columngap 15px     columnfill auto   .pin      display inlineblock     background FEFEFE     border 2px solid FAFAFA     boxshadow 0 1px 2px rgba34, 25, 25, 0.4     margin 0 2px 15px     webkitcolumnbreakinside avoid     mozcolumnbreakinside avoid     columnbreakinside avoid     padding 15px     paddingbottom 5px  codepre  pAnd a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netbXSqt3 relnofollowhere is a jsfiddlea showing the problem. There are four columns but in Chrome the third column is shorter than it needs to be, an image could have been moved from the fourth column to make them more even.

Negative 1731 pSo, I want my app to create a Service that will initially run in the background and do some stuff. This background process will never stop. It will constantly keep running. The ONLY way the background process can be created or destroyed would be through the app. I understand that there are endless possibilities to kill a process. I guess I want my app to be able to tell me whether or not the process is running and retrieve real time information from that process. Along with that, be able to start andor destroy the background process.p  pSo, lets say that you were to open the app and startcreate the service. Even when you closeterminalcall onDestroy for the app, I still want the background process to be running.

Negative 1731 pI have one table A with a phrase, and the other B is a phrase that I want to find WITHIN table As phrase. So Im joining them as followsp  pre classlangsql prettyprintoverridecodeCreate table C as SELECT A. FROM A JOIN B where A.phrase LIKE concat,B.phrase, codepre  pIt is taking a long time because its only using one reducer, and I believe this has to do with the nature of the query Is there a way of speeding this up I dont think a mapjoin or bucketjoin would help, because Im not equating two columns, but rather, searching within one table for words from another table...p
Negative 1731 pId like to use openoffice to programmatically convert docx to pdf. I know unoconv can do this, and indeed unoconv will do this for me, even if I run a separate listener using codeunoconv lcode and invoke codeunoconv ncode so that it will die if it cant connect to the listener. Accordingly, I assume that my openofficepyuno environment is sane.p  pHowever, when I run an unoconv listener or manually invoke openoffice as an acceptor, and try to connect with my own python code derived from unoconv, and crosschecked with another openoffice library, the listener dies, and the uno bridge dies.p  pThe error I get from the listener isp  precodeterminate called after throwing an instance of comsunstarunoRuntimeException codepre  pThe error I get on the python end isp  precodeunoconv RuntimeException during import phase Office probably died. Binary URP bridge disposed during call codepre  pI really have no idea how to go about diagnosing the problem here.

Negative 1731 pSee this fiddle a hrefhttpjsfiddle.net5vTc7 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.net5vTc7ap  pIf you open the console, you can see that the regular expression in the pattern attribute code[09].[09].[19]code works as expected from JS, but when you enter anything in the input and try to submit, it fails.p  pIn case theres something wrong with my regular expression, Im simply trying to limit it to numbers greater than 0. Id like to use the number input i.e., codeltinput typenumbergtcode, but I cant, because it doesnt allow you to format the values e.g., it will display 0.00000001 as 1e8, which is undesirable.p  pI am clueless here.

Negative 1731 pIve rewritten this question now as I dont think the problem is to do with the URL rewrite.p  pIm building a site with PHP and Smarty and using fairly common url rewriting using apaches mod rewrite.p  pLocally, if I visit strongexample.comsearchqteststrong, I get search results for test. strongsearchstrong is not a real directory, its forwarding to strongsearch.phpqstrongp  pWhen I upload, its not working. Ive enabled rewrite with codesudo a2enmod rewritecode and the url is updating, the browser shows strongexample.comsearchqteststrong in the address bar, doesnt throw a 404, but just serves up my index.php page instead.p  pIve realised the problem is probably to do with my Smarty caching. Ive got a URL variable that triggers the cache to be rebuilt, emrebuildCacheNowem.p  pIf I go to emaccountem, I get the index page, but if I go to emaccountrebuildCacheNowem the account page shows up.p  pIf I then go back to the index, emem, it still shows the account page. Going to emrebuildCacheNowem shows me the home page.p  pThis is my main Smarty templatep  precode Smarty   ltDOCTYPE htmlgt lt[if lt IE 7 ]gtlthtml classie ie6 langengtlt[endif]gt lt[if IE 7 ]gtlthtml classie ie7 langengtlt[endif]gt lt[if IE 8 ]gtlthtml classie ie8 langengtlt[endif]gt lt[if gt IE 8]gtltgtlthtml langengtltlt[endif]gt  include head.tpl  ltbody idtopgt  include header.tpl  ltdiv classcontentcontainergt     ltdiv classcontainer contentgt       include page.content     ltdivgt ltdivgt  include footer.tpl  ltscript srcJQUERYCDNgtltscriptgt ltscript srcBOOTSTRAPJSCDNgtltscriptgt ltscript srcjsmain.jsgtltscriptgt page.scripts  ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pEvery page serves up this template, but Im using PHP to assign codepage.contentcode.

This may end up being a bug but it makes me wonder if the compiler allowed that same leeway in the context of a codeconstexprcode as well or does the compiler have to strictly adhere to what the standard says is undefined behavior herep  pBUpdateBp  pAs Alan mentions, it is indeed true that the diagnostic of an emillformedem program can be either an error or a warning but in this case codegcccode does not seem to consider the program emillformedem. Unlike other instances such as in the case of a hrefhttpcoliru.stackedcrooked.coma6050b54d92e88270 relnofollowoverflowa, codegcccode does not complain about an invalid constexpr but warns about the shifts. So then it would seem that either it is a bug or codegcccode does not consider these cases to be emundefinedem and hence my question.p

Negative 1731 pI have a directive that uses the parent scope in that view. This directive has a child directive that uses an isolated scope. I am trying to get the parent directive to watch any changes done to the ngModel of the child directive and update its own modal if changes were made.

If you type inside each of them, the other model gets updated since they are binded by codengmodelcode. However, the child directives text input gets updated after a server connection. When that happens, the text input in the parent directive doesnt get updated. So I think I need to watch the ngModel inside the child directive for any changes. strongHow can I do that Does it make sensestrong p

As people enter data into the form and click the button, the form data is added to the grid below.p  pMy plan is to use a BeginForm and send the form to an HttpPost controller method for processing and then bounce back to the view.  Currently, I am using this for the form on the viewp  precodeusing Html.BeginFormAddRefund, Refund, FormMethod.Post codepre  pIn the controller, I have this p  precode[HttpPost] public ActionResult AddRefundRefundModel refund       if ModelState.IsValid            etc... codepre  pMy problem is that the refund object in controller always arrives from the view empty.  From my research, it seems that the model reference in the controller is just there to provide model structure, and NOT to receive the actual model from the view.  I dont understand why this is, however, as it would seem very valuable to be able to send a populated viewmodel from the view to a controller.p  pAlso, how would you guys handle the code for this problem  How would you collect all of these form submissions from the user, present them to the user in the grid below the form, and then ultimately submit the page and insert all of the items in the grid into the databasep  hr  pedit here is my viewp  precodemodel RefundsProject.Models.RefundModel  using Html.BeginFormAddRefund, Refund, FormMethod.Post      all of the form elements are here      ltinput idbuttonadd typesubmit value Add Refund to List  gt  codepre  pEventually, there will be another button at the very bottom of the view that will submit all of the items the user entered into the grid to the database.p

Negative 1731 pOn occasion it is required that a DIV is a specific size so to ensure that the layout lines up but often it seems impossible to fine the CSS to ensure that it sits correctly in all of the major browsers.p  pFor example this simple a hrefhttpjsfiddle.net5P53V relnofollow titleJSFiddle example of issueJSFiddlea shows a few tabs that select the div that is shown below the tabs. To make it look more like you are pulling the section to the surface using the tab it overlaps the section slightly with no lower border so it appears the tab and section are one and the same.p  pThe issue is that the height of the tab must be exact or the illusion is destroyed. With this example the tabs are the correct size in the latest Firefox, Safari last PC version amp Chrome but a pixel to short in Opera so it doesnt overwrite the top border of the text section details div and two pixels to small in IE 10 so there is actually a gap between the tabs and main section.p  pI know I could create a separate style sheet that only loads for IE and Opera etc but I would rather avoid it if possible as it will increase the work for maintaining the site.p  h3HTML from JSFiddleh3  pre classlanghtml prettyprintoverridecodeltdiv classproductdetailspagegt     ltdiv classdetailstabsgt         ltdiv classtabsgt             ltdiv classdescription selectedgtDescriptionltdivgt             ltdiv classdeliveryOptionsgtDelivery Optionsltdivgt         ltdivgt         ltdiv classdetailsgt             ltdiv classdescription showgtA big description of a product.

Negative 1731 pA developer solved an issue with Hibernate 3 and WAS 7.5, wherein evidently WAS uses an old version of the hibernate jpa bridge.  The developer put the jpa 2.0 jar in the ext folder to get WAS to load it in the bootstrap classloader, and so use the more recent version.  This in fact works, but feels wrong.p  pWe recently upgraded to Hibernate 4 on some apps and did the same with 2.1.  Now we are migrating to WAS 8.5.5, and it evidently needs the same treatment.  It seems to have updated to use 2.0 because those apps run, but the Hibernate 4 apps need 2.1, and the ext folder trick suddenly stopped working.p  pSo this is a perfect time to revisit this and ask, what is the right way to solve this problem  Or, if you dont know the right way, how can I do the equivalent of the ext folder trick in WAS 8.5.5  p  pIn case youre curious, the exact error isp  pjava.lang.NoClassDefFoundError javax.persistence.AttributeConverterp

Negative 1731 pI am trying to do something specific using the DirectX 9 APIs in my application. p  pWhen I setup the directx device it requires a window handle HWND which ultimately the graphics driver ends up knowing about and using. What I am trying to do is inside the given window handle just have the graphics driver render to ONLY a specific portion of the window and leave the rest of the window untouched. For example. Lets say my window size is 1280x720 and I only want the video frame to render and present to a location inside the window of say 300x200. What is the best way using the directx 9 API to do this. I have the device all setup and I can already render video just fine to the entire window, but I am trying now to render to a window handle that already contains contents and specifies to me where I should render my video frame on the same window. I notice that event if I specify to present to that location it blacks out the entire window along with displaying my frame when I make the call to PresentEx.p  pI am wondering if there is a way to tell the graphics driver NOT to black out everything else in that window Initially this window has some HTML elements created and I am trying to not have the driver clobber the rest of the window. p  pI thought about somehow having the entire back buffer present to the window but somehow making a portion of the buffer where I dont want to draw to transparent, but I do not konw how to achieve this either.

To that End I created a variable  called mostRecentCoord that I maintain on load that holds initial location p  precode  voidmapViewGMSMapView mapView idleAtCameraPositionGMSCameraPosition position           Here mostRecentCoord is self descriptive, latest entry before this move occured.   ifposition.target.latitude  mostRecentCoord.latitude ampamp position.target.longitude      mostRecentCoord.longitude      return    codepre  pI thought that I can put a limit on the change in lngtitude or latitude , and based on that decide whether to load new data or not, but then I have to take into account zoom level, scope of coverage.  Anyone has ideas on this would appreciate itp
Negative 1731 pIm working on an application that interfaces with a slightly odd database. The design of this database is pretty bad there are basically no foreign keys although there are columns that reference other tables, theyre not set as keys, columns are named very ambiguously, and the structure does not lend itself to the kind of logic Im aiming to do mostly, it forces joins for operations that should be simple, and leaves you trawling through needlessly massive tables for things that could have been split.p  pUnfortunately, Im stuck with this database. Its being replicated off a thirdparty system, so I cant change the table structure or anything. I can add stored procedures and views, though.p  pIn the application, Ive come up with a set of classes that I can work with much more easily. Ive got quite a bit of experience with Entity Framework, so Im planning to use that. My initial hunch is that I can add views to the database that return things in the format of my classes, and then from there on out just pretend that theyre tables. Ive never tried anything like this before, though, and Im not entirely sure how to proceed.p  pHow can I use Entity Framework to map my classes to these views Note that it kinda needs to be my POCO classes, rather than anything EF autogenerates  is there a way to tell EF to map existing classesp

Negative 1731 pI am exporting UML diagrams in Open Office Draw using Java UNO Runtime Reference Api in Open Office. Initially I tried to connect Open Office using Bootstrap.bootstrap method but it resulted in No office executable found exception. Then according to the post a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14157644noofficeexecutablefoundexceptionwhileconnectingtoopenofficethroughjavaNo office executable found exception while connecting to OpenOffice through Javaa , I downloaded bootstrapconnector.jar and it worked fine for me. But in this case the user has to provide the path of the of the Open Office installation and my requirement is to connect to the Open Office instance by programmatically finding the installation path. One method I know is by means of working with WinRegistry but in this case I think that the registry key may change with underlying OS. Therefore it would be a great help if someone can suggest me some other method of achieving this. p

I only added a toggleable show resolved comments link to this version.  Even though I initialized every variable to nonnull values the problem still happens.p  pstrongFull description of the actual problemstrongp  pI have two controllers nested into each other. The outer controller showshides the inner controller by using an ngswitch directive.p  pThe outer controller also contains a checkbox. If this checkbox gets checked then the inner controller is made visible via the above ngswitch directive. This checkbox works as intended.p  pTheres also an open link outside the controllers. Its onclick handler calls into the outer controller and is supposed to check the checkbox via the model.

Negative 1731 pI have been digging through IBM knowledge center and have returned frustrated at the lack of definition to some of their scripting interfaces.p  pIBM keeps talking about a ema hrefhttpwww01.ibm.comsupportknowledgecenterSSEQTP8.0.0com.ibm.websphere.base.docinfoaesaetxmlspecifyconfig.htmllangen relnofollowcontainment pathaem used in their id definitions and I am only assuming that it corresponds to an xml element within file in the websphere config folder hierachy, but thats only from observation.

Object attributes and this is not attributes in the strict xml sense as attributes could be nested nodes with a simple structure within the parent node may be queried using codeAdminConfig.showAttributeltelementidgt, ltattributenamegtcode. This function will either return the string value of the inline attribute of the element itself or a string list representation of the ids of the nested attribute nodes.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong I have discovered the codeAdminConfig.typescode function that will display a list of all manipulatible object types in the configuration files and the codeAdminConfig.parentcode function that displays what nodes are considered parents of the specified node.p  blockquote   pemNoteem The codeAdminConfig.parentcode function does not reveal the parents in order of their hierachy, rather it seems to just present a list of parents. e.g. codeAdminConfig.parentJDBCProvidercode gives us this exact list codeCellnDeploymentnNodenServernServerClustercode and even though codeServercode comes before codeServerClustercode , running codeAdminConfig.parentServercode reveals its parents as codeNodenServerClustercode. Although some elements can have no parents  e.g. codeCellcode  Some elements produce an error when running the codeparentcode function  e.g. codeDeploymentcode.p      pDue to the apparent lack of a reciprocal codeAdminConfig.childrencode function, It appears as though obtaining a full hierachical tree of parentschildren lies in calling this function on each of the elements returned from the codeAdminConfig.parentltgtcode call and combining the results. That being said, a trial and error approach is mostly fruitful due to the sometimes obvious ordering.p blockquote

Negative 1731 pI am baffled by this exercise.p  blockquote   pExercise 9.22 Assuming iv is a vector of ints, what is wrong with the following program How might you correct the problemsp blockquote  precodevectorltintgtiterator iter  iv.begin,                       mid   iv.begin  iv.size2  whileiter  mid          ifiter  someval         iv.insertiter, 2  someval codepre  pThe first thing I would do is go and ask what the intent of this program was. Since I am not sure who wrote this section of the book and dont want to bother the authors for something probably trivial I started guessing.p  pI assume they want to insert the double of the first value in the vector until the value is in the middle. since they point iter to the beginning and never move through the vector to look for an actual value then again they named it someval, to look for a value not at the beginning is a trivial fix, but then one would have to validate that the value actually is in the first half of the containerp  pso a vector would grow like thisp  precode1,2,3,4,5 2,1,2,3,4,5 2,2,1,2,3,4,5 2,2,2,1,2,3,4,5 codepre  pThe first problem in that case, inserting in a vector most likely instantly invalidates the iterators. We could use a list instead, but then we cant use iterator arithmetic to calculate the mid. Calculating the mid only once like in the example is not enough, since in a list like a. it would point to the 3 and keep pointing to the 3, just because we called the iterator mid and initialized him with the element in the mid doesnt mean it still points to the mid after all those inserts.p  pSo here is what I didp  precodevectorltintgtiterator iteriv.begin  whileiteriv.beginiv.size2    calculating mid each time     ifitersomeval         iv.insertiter,2someval      iteriv.begin                        revalidate iter     whileitersomeval                  find the original first element         iter  codepre  pI see how the exercise forces you to think about which sequential container to use and how iterators behave in a growing container, but the way the exercise is presented, still baffles me. Did I miss some obvious pointp  pPS Since the whole chapter deals with sequential containers I did not focus on the problems that arise with the condition in the while loop it is like they forgot everything they taught just a few chapters ago.p

Negative 1731 pIm building an app part in sharepoint o365 using angularjs, which displays a list of items im following docs, sites. I display the items as tiles in rows of 4 below each other, and to fit the app part nicely on any page, I calculate the height of the most outer div topContainer which contains all items. I calculate the height when the ngrepeat finishes rendering with a custom directive. The resizing is done with a postmessagep  precodevar resizeAppPart  function width, height       if senderId ampamp hostweburl          var message  ltMessage senderId  senderId   gt                  resize  width  ,  height  ltMessagegt         window.parent.postMessagemessage, hostweburl       codepre  pThe height and width are provided by p  precode var heightDoc  topContainer.height  var widthDoc  topContainer.width  myUtils.resizeAppPartwidthDoc, heightDoc codepre  pIf I usep  precodedocument.heightwidth codepre  pit delivers the same result.p  pThis works perfectly when loading the page. However I also provide a button which allows a user to unfollow any of the displayed items. Then the item disappears splice from the array, the repeat gets updated nicely, and I try to recalculate the height of the app part so no gap remains when unfollowing an item. I can successfully call the recalculate size function for the app part thats not the problem however I just cant get the right height of the app part.. The height remains the same as before unfollowing an item, even though theres now a gap where the unfollowed item was..p  pSo Im trying to find a method to get the right height of the app part after removing the item from the array.

Negative 1731 pThis is quite a general computer science question  and not specific to any OS or framework. p  pSo I am a little confused by the overhead associated with switching tasks on a thread pool. In many cases it doesnt make sense to give every job its own specific thread we dont want to create too many hardware threads, so instead we put these jobs into tasks which can be scheduled to run on a thread. We setup up a pool of threads and then dynamically allocate the tasks to run on a thread taken from the thread pool. p  pI am just a little confused cant find a in depth answer on the overhead associated  with switching tasks on a specific thread in the thread pool. A DrDobbs article sourced below states it does but I need a more in depth answer to what is actually happening a citeable source would be fantastic .p  pQuotep  precodeBy definition, SomeWork must be queued up in the pool and then run on a different thread than the original thread. This means we necessarily incur queuing overhead plus a context switch just to move the work to the pool. If we need to communicate an answer back to the original thread, such as through a message or Future or similar, we will incur another context switch for that. codepre  pWhat components of the thread are actually switching The thread itself isnt actually switching, just the data that is specific to the thread.

Negative 1731 pI have a bit of an interesting question here about performance and was wondering if there was any way to do what I want to dop  pIm dealing with a large codebase 10,000 lines, I want to run the code and get a visual analysis of what lines takes up the most time in the code. Like for example, is there anything that can highlight the lines of code that take up the longest amounts of time in .NET andor give you a time spent on each line In my mind, Im visualizing something simple, like a green, yellow, and red highlight for each line of code and perhaps an amount of time that tells you how long each line took to run.p  pOne way to get times would be through the codeStopwatchcode, but its such a pain to have to have to add Stopwatches over and over again. How could I go about profiling my codebase like this Does Visual Studio or .NET have anything out of the box for thisp  pstrongEditstrong Thanks to Patrick, I found out about ANTS, which does exactly what I wanted above also shows codeHOTcode lines in red in another window  lines that take up the most time...FYI this isnt a profiler advertisement I just required a linebyline profiler for my needs and this does the trick so take it or leave itp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comMthrF.png altenter image description herep

Negative 1731 pIve got a ViewController which contains a vertical UIScrollView. To said UIScrollView I add multiple subviews, each of which contains a horizontal UIScrollView which contains some images and is paged.p  pWhen creating these subviews, I add a UITapGestureRecognizer to their UIScrollViews to detect single taps on them and perform an action depending on which image was being displayed.p  pThe problem Ive got is that if I have 2 such subviews and tap the first one in line, it picks up the wrong subview and tries to fire the method on the second one. So, say I tapped the 3rd image of the 1st subview, and the 2nd subview only has 1 page, then the app crashes.p  pHeres the constructor for my subviewp  precode idinit       NSArray arrayOfViews  [[NSBundle mainBundle] loadNibNamedGalleryLeafView                                                       ownernil                                                     optionsnil]     GalleryLeafView galleryLeafView  [arrayOfViews objectAtIndex0]     self  galleryLeafView      if self            Set up tap gesture recognizers on the ScrollView         UITapGestureRecognizer tapGestureRecognizer  [[UITapGestureRecognizer alloc] initWithTargetself actionselectorimageTapped]         tapGestureRecognizer.numberOfTapsRequired  1         [self.scrollView addGestureRecognizertapGestureRecognizer]           return self  codepre  pHeres the selector method, just in casep  precode voidimageTapped       NSString filename  [imageFilenames objectAtIndex[self getCurrentPage]]     NSString caption  [captions objectAtIndex[self getCurrentPage]]      [self.galleryLeafViewDelegate galleryLeafViewPressedWithFilenamefilename captioncaption]  codepre  pAny ideas as to why this happens Or how I can work around thisp

Negative 1731 pRs abbreviate is useful for truncating, among other things, the column names of a data frame to a set length, with nice checks to ensure uniqueness, etc.p  precodeabbreviatenamesdframe, minlength2 codepre  pOne could, of course, use this function to abbreviate the column names inplace and then print out the altered data framep  precodegtgtnamesdframe lt abbreviatenamesdframe, minlength2 gtgtdframe codepre  pBut I would like to print out the data frame with abbreviated column names emwithoutem altering the data frame in the process. Hopefully this can be done through a simple format option in the print call, though my search through the help pages of print and format methods like print.data.frame didnt turn up any obvious solution the available options seem more for formatting the column values, not their names.p  pSo, does print or format have any options that call abbreviate on the column names If not, is there a way to apply abbreviate to the column names of a data frame before passing it to print, again without altering the passed data frame p  pThe more I think about it, the more I think that the only way would be to pass print a copy of the data frame with already abbreviated column names. But this is not a solution for me, because I dont want to constantly be updating this copy as I update the original during an interactive session. The original column names must remain unaltered, because I use  whichcolnamesdframenameofcolumn to interface with the data.p  pMy ultimate goal is to work better remotely on the small screen of my mobile device when working in ssh apps like Server Auditor. If the the column names are abbreviated to only 23 characters I can still recognize them but can fit much more data on the screen. Perhaps there even are R packages that are better suited for condensed printingp

My database is supposed to be for a BorrowingLendingNetwork where users can borrow products from other users.

The only exception should be that a user cannot borrow products that were offered by himself.p  pSo my question is which of these two options is the better onep  pHaving one entity for user which can borrow and lend. Entity name USER. Having two different entities for both borrowers and givers in order to prevent a user from borrowing his own productsp
Negative 1731 pIve asked AtTask support and havent gotten a reply in a couple weeks. There appears to be a difference between AtTask Sandbox and AtTask OnDemand.  I have a script PHP developed to extract timeoff from a SharePoint list and update the TimeOff calendar in AtTask.  It works perfectly in the Sandbox, but not at all in OnDemand.  p  pOur Sandbox refreshes from production every weekend.  The users are identical and have identical permissions.  However, when I point my script at OnDemand, I cant even get the thing to log in.  Consequently, the rest of the process fails. p  pThe URL Im using to login to Sandbox  which works isp  pa hrefhttpsCOMPANY.attasksandbox.comattaskapiv4.0loginusernameUSERNAMECOMPANY.COMamppasswordPASSWORD relnofollowhttpsCOMPANY.attasksandbox.comattaskapiv4.0loginusernameUSERNAMECOMPANY.COMamppasswordPASSWORDap  pThe URL which Im using for OnDemand, which doesnt work isp  pa hrefhttpsCOMPANY.attaskondemand.comattaskapiv4.0loginusernameUSERNAMECOMPANY.COMamppasswordPASSWORD relnofollowhttpsCOMPANY.attaskondemand.comattaskapiv4.0loginusernameUSERNAMECOMPANY.COMamppasswordPASSWORDap  pThe login credentials work on both sites when entered from the login form, and provide the same exact user rights.  Ive tested multiple sets of credentials with the same results. p  pOne other thing that is strange is that the command to login to the OnDemand server works when submitted trough Chromes Advanced RESTful Client, but fails when submitted from a PHP script.p  pMy guess is that there is something different in the server configuration between Sandbox and OnDemand SSL, but have not been able to get any confirmation from AtTask.p  pThanks in advance for any insight. p  pMarkp

Negative 1731 pI am somewhat new to the smart pointer world of C 11. I have been doing memory management manually and decided to dive into smart pointers. However, there is somewhat of a confusion though when it comes to codemanagerscodep  pI define a manager asp  blockquote   pAn object that owns and manages a set of objects. The objects are exclusively owned by the manager and its the managers responsibly to control their life cycle ie. delete them. It dispenses the objects for use in other parts of the program, but does not give away ownership.p blockquote  pIn other words, it lets other parts of the program borrow the resources it manages.p  pWhat I am a little bit confused about, is how to ensure ownership is preserved by the managerp  pFor instance, in a videogame, a Sprite might request a Texture from a texture manager. The sprite doesnt own the texture, it simply wants to use it. One way to do this, is to utilize a list of codeuniqueptrcodes. So I havep  precode    stdlistltstduniqueptrltSpriteTexturegtgt spriteTextureList codepre  pThis however doesnt work, because I cannot establish a codeweakptrcode to a codeuniqueptrcode. On the other hand, I can create a list of sharedpointersp  precode   stdlistltstdsharedptrltSpriteTexturegtgt spriteTextureList codepre  pThis will allow me to dispense codeweakptrcode to other parts of the program. However, the issue is that a sharedpointer can be duplicated, breaking ownership apart to multiple pointers. This of course can be controlled if I never pass back a shared pointer, but doing this seems to be counterintuitive for what a codesharedptrcode is meant to represent.p  pThe third alternative would be to simply dispense codesharedptrcode. However, this is not useful because then the manager doesnt technically own the objects. If the manager removes a codeTexturecode out of its list and something else has a codesharedptrcode to the codeTexturecode, then the texture wont be deleted. p  pIn the ideal situation this should be just fine, because there should be no existing pointers to the codeTexturecode before the manager deletes it, but I can see this becoming a debugging hassle.p  pI definitely have a weak understanding of smart pointers. Maybe I am miss understanding how smart pointers are supposed to be implementedp  pAny help is greatly appreciatedp

Negative 1731 pSo I have a codeUIViewControllercode that Im presenting over the current view modally. This view controller consists only of a codeUITableViewcode for selecting items, and a navigation bar at the top which has a Cancel button in case you dont want to select anything.p  pThe whole thing works just fine in almost any situation. Selecting an item works, pressing the cancel button dismisses the view, everything is fine. However, theres one case that causes the app to crash when you swipe left on an item in the table view to reveal the delete button, then press the cancel button at the top to dismiss the view, the app crashes and it doesnt say anything about the cause of the crash in the console output. Heres the code for the view controller Im presenting modallyp  p.hp  precodeimport ltUIKitUIKit.hgt import common.h  interface LoadViewController  UIViewController ltUITableViewDataSource, UITableViewDelegategt   IBActionlCancelButtonidsender property weak, nonatomic IBOutlet UITableView lTableView  end codepre  p.mp  precodeimport LoadViewController.h  interface LoadViewController       NSMutableArray sampleCounts     NSArray tableData  end  implementation LoadViewController  synthesize lTableView  lTableView   This is the table view itself   BOOLtableViewUITableView tableView canEditRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath      return YES    voidtableViewUITableView tableView commitEditingStyleUITableViewCellEditingStyleeditingStyle forRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath      if editingStyle  UITableViewCellEditingStyleDelete            Deleting an item when the delete button is pressed          [self.lTableView beginUpdates]           Deleting it from the table view first         [self.lTableView deleteRowsAtIndexPaths[NSArray arrayWithObjectindexPath] withRowAnimationUITableViewRowAnimationAutomatic]           ... then from the arrays as well         [sampleCounts removeObjectAtIndexindexPath.item]          making a mutable copy here so I can delete stuff from it         NSMutableArray tmp  [tableData mutableCopy]         [tmp removeObjectAtIndexindexPath.item]         tableData  tmp          [self.lTableView endUpdates]         voidviewDidLoad      [super viewDidLoad]     self.lTableView.allowsMultipleSelectionDuringEditing  NO     sampleCounts  [NSMutableArray array]     tableData  [NSMutableArray array]       Im filling up both arrays with the appropriate data here...     voiddidReceiveMemoryWarning      [super didReceiveMemoryWarning]    IBActionlCancelButtonidsender       Dismiss the view controller when Cancel is pressed     [self dismissViewControllerAnimatedYES completionnil]   NSInteger tableViewUITableView tableView numberOfRowsInSectionNSIntegersection      return self.tableData.count   void tableViewUITableView tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath       If an item gets selected, store the name of it I use a class called common for storing data like this, then dismiss the view     [common setItemName[tableData objectAtIndexindexPath.item]]     [self dismissViewControllerAnimatedYES completionnil]   UITableViewCell tableViewUITableView tableView cellForRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath      NSString ID  ID     UITableViewCell cell  [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifierID]      if cell  nil          cell  [[UITableViewCell alloc] initWithStyleUITableViewCellStyleSubtitle reuseIdentifierID]           cell.textLabel.text  [self.tableData objectAtIndex[indexPath row]]     cell.detailTextLabel.text  [sampleCounts objectAtIndex[indexPath row]]      return cell   end codepre  pSo as you can see, its very simple.

It only crashes when I press Cancel whenever a delete button is visible.p

Negative 1731 pWeve just upgraded to using TeamCity 9.0.1 and are looking to move towards Perforce Streams. We have a sample depot called Project containing streams forp  precodeProjectMain  ProjectSprint1  ProjectSprint2 codepre  pI would like to be able to configure TeamCity so we have a build capable of building all of these branches from one configuration.p  pI initially tried setting up a Perforce Stream VCS root in TeamCityp  precodeProjectteamcity.build.branch codepre  pand giving the variable a default value of Main. This works fine from within TeamCity  when I click Run... and change the variable name to Sprint1 it creates a new branch. However, if Im working in Sprint1 and want to do a remote build from Visual Studio it tells me there are no configurations which can build this change even though the branch has already been created.p  pIve tried switching to specifying client mapping, but Im unable to get the VS plugin to identify the configuration is valid. I guess the problem is that you cant customise the build parameters in the Visual Studio solution until it has worked out which configurations are valid and in this case the validity is impacted by the variable value. How do you setup Perforce Streams in TeamCity so that you can do personal builds to branchesp

I use the same code to present themp  precodeself.presentViewControllervc, animated true, completion nil codepre  pI also use the same code to dismiss them from a navigation bar buttonp  precodeself.dismissViewControllerAnimatedtrue, completion nil codepre  pWhen FilterViewController is dismissed, everything works like normal, but when DetailViewController is dismissed, navigation bar is removed from MainViewController.p  pWhile I can add a block of code to add new navigation bar to MainViewController when DetailViewController is dismissed, Id very much like to know what could be causing this unusual behaviourp  pI know I provided little information to aid in answering this question, but I dont know which parts of code could be relevant for this issue.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pThis is the only viewDid method in MainViewControllerp  precodeoverride func viewDidLoad      self.navigationController.navigationBar.opaque  true     self.navigationController.navigationBar.barTintColor  UIColorred 0.0745, green 0.2667, blue 0.4471, alpha 1     self.navigationItem.titleView  UIImageViewimage UIImagenamed HeadLogo      super.viewDidLoad  codepre  pThere are no warnings in the code, only few from ambiguous positions of Storyboard elements.p  pI dont understand why does dismissal of only DetailViewController remove navigation bar from MainViewController.

Negative 1731 pIm implementing a Snake game in javascript for fun, I have successfully implemented the snake, its movements and the emsnakegrowthem thing as it eats an apple.p  pTo calculate the apple position Im currently following these stepsp  ol licreate a new apple objectli licreate random coordinates X and Y, between gamecontainer boundaries for the appleli licheck if the coordinates of the apple are equal to one of the snakeblocks coordinatesli liif step 3 is TRUE, recalculate the position of the apple, else draw the apple in the gamecontainerli ol  pUnfortunately I found out that this algorithm is very weak.. lets say I have a 10 x 10 game container, the red square is the apple, the green square is my snake head initial game statep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comE5a9A.png altenter image description herep  pas the game progresses the snake eats more and more apples, increasing its length and leaving less and less empty cells to place an applep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comhUXxu.png altenter image description herep  pNow suppose that the snake reaches a length equals to 99 while eating an apple. This means that theres strongonly onestrong square left to place the next apple. My algorithm this is the worst case obviously could take forever in order to randomize the correct value, as it discards any randomized position that its already taken by the snakes head or tail, not caring at all to randomize the new position in a range of empty cells only but instead randomizing on the whole 10 x 10 game canvas.p  pHow should I proceed to solve my busillis Can you give me any advice on a good algorithm that I can usep  pThank youp

Negative 1731 pIm trying to populate a meteor template based on a parameter I send in through the address bar.p  pIm using Iron router and when I looked in its documentation I found this examplep  precodeRouter.routepostid, function     this.renderPost,      data function         return Posts.findOneid this.params.id          codepre  pI tried something similar but Im struggling to find how I actually use that data property in the template. Previously Ive used a template helper to do a find on the db which has worked perfectly as long as its always the same find command. Now that I want to customise that find based on what I pass in through the address bar Im struggling to do that.p  pUsing the Iron router example above I tried something like thisp  precodeRouter.routefruitcolour, function     this.renderfruitTemplate,      data function         return FruidDb.findcolour this.params.colour          codepre  pThis is where I get stuck. Normally to populate my template I would use a helper like belowp  precodeTemplate.fruitTemplate.helpers   fruitByColour function        return FruidDb.findcolour green     codepre  pthen just foreach through each fruitByColourp  pBut now that Im dynamically getting that data Im not sure how to get the data that is returned from the Route to the helper.p  pMaybe Im doing this completely wrong. If there is a better way to just pass the param to the helper and do the db.find from there that would probably be best but Im finding it hard to see the best way to do this and would greatly appreciate any helpp

Negative 1731 pCan springrabbit be made to support multiple concurrent consumers on a single topicp  pHere are the detailsp  pMy system uses manual ack mode with a topic exchange via springrabbit Spring 4.0.6.  The pattern is as follows p  ul liMessage comes into ChannelAwareMessageListenerli liA factory method generates an appropriate worker and passes in a reference to the channelli liIf the worker successfully processes the message, the message is Ackdli liIf the worker is unsuccessful or an exception happens, the message is Nackd and sent into a dead letter queue for later processingli ul  pSince some of these workers can take a fair bit of time to complete their IObound processing, I need to be able to set a higher number of concurrent consumers.  p  pAfter some testing, however, Ive noticed that there are times when several consumers are receiving the same message.  Sure enough, a look at the documentation a hrefhttpdocs.spring.iospringframeworkdocs4.0.6.RELEASEjavadocapiorgspringframeworkjmslistenerDefaultMessageListenerContainer.htmlsetConcurrentConsumersint relnofollowhttpdocs.spring.iospringframeworkdocs4.0.6.RELEASEjavadocapiorgspringframeworkjmslistenerDefaultMessageListenerContainer.htmlsetConcurrentConsumersinta, confirms my findingp  blockquote   pDo not raise the number of concurrent consumers for a topic, unless vendorspecific setup measures clearly allow for it. With regular setup, this would lead to concurrent consumption of the same message, which is hardly ever desirable.p blockquote  pMy questions are as followsp  ol liWhat the heck does unless vendorspecific setup measures clearly allow for it mean  Is there a patchversionconfiguration or Rabbit that supports thisli liI can easily write code on the client that prevents a message from being processed if its already being processed by another worker.  What, then, do I do with this message  Send nack  Ignore it  What happens if I nack and then the worker which is actually processing the message sends an ack some time later  Will an exception be thrownli ol  pThanks in advance...p

Negative 1731 pIm having some problems with my socket connection, I can leave the app running on background and go back in and everything works fine. When I open multiple apps to drain the device memory, my app and its service get killed and when I return to it everything gets recreated as expected. Nothing wrong so far. The problem arises when I DONT do that, when I leave my app running on the background and just turn off the screen for a long period of time 15 minutes. I have a live socket connection living on a service that apparently gets disconneted. The service itself does NOT get killed. Im sure of that, but the connection stops responding some how.p  pIm suspicions that deep sleep is to blame for two reasons. 1. This never happens on the emulator. 2. This never happens on my device when plugged in via USB.p  pI might be wrong, but Id like to know how this work. I coundt find much documentation about this. I would like a way to know when the device is about to enter sleep mode so I can kill the service myself so when it gets recreated also will the socketp  pIm using firebase btw. p

Negative 1731 pOnce upon a time, in a SQL server deep in the forest, there was a lovely little agent job that passed a few parameters to an SSIS package and ran it.  It worked smoothly as clockwork every day.p  pHowever, this job had an evil twin, living in the same server, using the same SSIS package and identical to the working job in every way except the parameter values. iThisi job failed with the error The command line parameters are invalid.p  pThe really confusing thing about the evil job was this when a kindhearted DBA came skipping by one day, he took its command line ran it in the Execute Package Utility, and it ran just fine.  Hmm, thought the DBA.  There might be a problem other than the parameter values.p  pThe evil job fails in both 32 and 64bit modes, with the same error.  The only differences between the parameters arep  ol liTwo of them contain underscores that arent present in the working job all the parameters are surrounded with double quotesli liTwo of them are folder paths, one of which goes a level deeper than its equivalent in the working jobli ol  pIm reluctant to post the full command line, as it contains sensitive information, but will censor and post it if needed.p  pAre there any fundamental differences between the ways in which agent jobs and the Execute Package Utility run SSIS packages  Anything else that might explain thisp

Negative 1731 pIm adapting an existing Tumblr theme and am having a few problems. When the user creates a custom page and uses the standard layout the text they put in doesnt show up anywhere on the page. Ive trawled through docs and tutorials to try and find out how the text from custom pages is rendered but there doesnt appear to be any information on the topic. All I can find is a few hacky ways for displaying something only on a custom page, but I cant figure out how to get the actual text or title that the user enters. Any ideasp

Negative 1731 pIm writing a Java library, actually, a Clojure library, but for this question, what matters is that it runs on the JVM. This library needs to execute some JavaScript. a hrefhttpscarouselapps.com20150911isomorphicclojurescriptjavascriptforprerenderingsinglepageapplicationspart1I tried with Nashorna but I encounter some limitations that might be too hard to overcome. As an alternative, I want to try NodeJS.p  pI want my library to be self contained, to not depend on the system running NodeJS independently and thus requiring a particular deployment mechanism to place the Java and NodeJS artifacts in the right places to be picked up by the two different network servers. This approach, though, brings some issues.p  pI will be talking to NodeJS over HTTP but I dont want NodeJS to open a specific port. I want to find a random unused one so theres no collisions. I also want to control where the logs from NodeJS go, as to keep them with the rest of my application. Lastly, my app should be able to detect when NodeJS crashed and rerun it or report an error with information.p  pWhats the best way to approach this Are there any Java libraries to help manage child process in this fashion Anything in particular I should do from the NodeJS side Im very new to NodeJS, I never used it before.p

But, when I try to add filter on the specific column of the data in Tableau, it keep running... for ever.
