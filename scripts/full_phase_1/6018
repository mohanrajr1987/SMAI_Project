Positive 6018 pIm wondering whats the most efficient way of repainting in my case, and how to go about it.p  pIve got a codeJFramecode, containing a codeJPanelcode. This codeJPanelcode contains a some AWT graphics. Some of these graphics are fixed, they dont move. Some other graphics on top of the fixed graphics in this panel do move. The layout is updated every 3 seconds. The fixed graphics require quite a bit of math to draw, so I probably dont want to repaint all graphics, but only the moving ones. p  pThis is the possibilities I came up withp  ol liTo put the fixed graphics and the moving graphics in two separate panels and only repaint one panel, which are layed over each other.li liTo add two different codeGraphicscode objects to the panel one for fixed graphics and one for the moving and only repaint one graphics object. is this even possibleli liPerhaps some other way I dont knowli ol

Positive 6018 pI have an old library technical debt that needs to stay in place for now, and it uses the AWT AffineTransform. Our new graphics code uses the JavaFX Affine. Is there a clear 11 mapping between the twop  pIf there is an existing FLOSS library providing this mapping as a utility, I would appreciate that reference. If not, please describe how to convert an instance of java.awt.geom.AffineTransform to an instance of javafx.scene.transform.Affine.p  pIn lieu of a clear conversion path, I will accept a description of the compatibilities between the two classes and the challenges of working with both.p

How can I write a new method to move the shapes Here is what I have so farp  precodepublic class SwingBot   public static void mainString[] args       JFrame frame  new JFrame      frame.setSize400,400     frame.setTitleSwingBot      frame.setDefaultCloseOperationJFrame.EXITONCLOSE      Robot r  new Robot      frame.addr      frame.setVisibletrue      Scanner in  new ScannerSystem.in     boolean repeat  true     System.out.println     while repeat              String str  in.next         String direc  str.toLowerCase         if direc.equalsright                      r.moveBot10,0                  else if direc.equalsleft                      r.moveBot10,0                  else if direc.equalsup                      r.moveBot0,10                  else if direc.equalsdown                      r.moveBot0,10                  else if direc.equalsexit                      repeat  false                   public static class Robot extends JComponent      private Ellipse2D e  new Ellipse2D.Double20,20,100,50      public void paintComponentGraphics g              Graphics2D g2  Graphics2D g          g2.setColorColor.BLACK         g2.fillOval45,60,50,50         g2.fille          g2.setColorColor.RED         g2.fillOval40,40,20,20         g2.fillOval80,40,20,20             public void moveBotint x, int y               repaint        codepre  pp  pThe moveBot method at the bottom is empty because it originally had the translate method called on some rectangle objects, but I changed those to ellipses and ovals. Now I dont know how to move these without the translate method.p

But many a times, in graphics and user interface part, the awt section is skipped or omitted and swing is placed instead and said that awt is of no use or less important. I wish to make android applications in studio.....so is learning and studying awt important in respect to android app development or should i jump over to swing and advance java sectionp

Positive 6018 pin my project i have a scrollpane which can contains various panel, depending by user action. By the way, id like to have each panel of a fixed height, and on add, they should be shown one below the previous. Instead they change their height depending to the number of existing panels. I wrote a main class with the goal of reproducing current behaviour, and an image which should explain what am I aiming for.p  pimagep  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comH1EgH.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comH1EgH.png altenter image description hereap  pcodep  precodeimport java.awt.BorderLayout import java.awt.Color import java.awt.Dimension import java.awt.event.MouseEvent import java.awt.event.MouseListener  import javax.swing.Box import javax.swing.JButton import javax.swing.JFrame import javax.swing.JLabel import javax.swing.JPanel import javax.swing.JScrollPane import javax.swing.ScrollPaneConstants import javax.swing.SwingUtilities   public class MyClass       static JScrollPane myScrollPaneContent     static Box panelContainer     static int i0      public static void mainString[] args                  SwingUtilities.invokeLaternew Runnable              public void run                    int i0                 mainWindow                     JFrame mainWindow  new JFrameMyFrame                     mainWindow.setLayoutnew BorderLayout                     mainWindow.setMinimumSizenew Dimension1050,300                  panel to be placed in mainwindow borderlayout.Center                 contains a menu  scrollpane                     JPanel centerPanel  new JPanel                  Box for myScrollPaneContent                 panelContainer  Box.createVerticalBox                       button for centerPanel                     JButton button  new JButtonaddPanel                     button.setBackgroundColor.green                     button.addMouseListenernew MouseListener                          Override                         public void mouseReleasedMouseEvent e                              nothing                                                  Override                         public void mousePressedMouseEvent e                              nothing                                                   Override                         public void mouseExitedMouseEvent e                              nothing                                                   Override                         public void mouseEnteredMouseEvent e                              nothing                                                   Override                         public void mouseClickedMouseEvent e                              addPanel                                                                    centerPanel.addbutton                       myScrollPaneContent  new JScrollPanepanelContainer                     myScrollPaneContent.setPreferredSizenew Dimension600,250                     myScrollPaneContent.setVerticalScrollBarPolicyScrollPaneConstants.VERTICALSCROLLBARALWAYS                      all panels are added to the Box                       the box do not need to be added to scroll pane since it has been given into it s constructor                      the scrollpane is added to the centralpanel                     centerPanel.addmyScrollPaneContent                      mainWindow.addcenterPanel,BorderLayout.CENTER                     mainWindow.addBox.createVerticalGlue,BorderLayout.SOUTH                       mainWindow.setVisibletrue                                    public static void addPanel         switchi         case 0             panel 1 for Box             JPanel one  new JPanel             JLabel labOne  new JLabelhello             one.addlabOne             one.setPreferredSizenew Dimension1000,25             one.setBackgroundColor.white             panelContainer.addone              break         case 1             panel 2 for Box             JPanel two  new JPanel             JLabel labTwo  new JLabeli am a label             two.addlabTwo             two.setPreferredSizenew Dimension1000,30             two.setBackgroundColor.yellow             panelContainer.addtwo             break         case 2             panel 3 for Box             JPanel three  new JPanel             JLabel labThree  new JLabelBye bye             three.addlabThree             three.setPreferredSizenew Dimension1000,30             three.setBackgroundColor.gray             panelContainer.addthree             break         case 3             panel 4 for Box             JPanel four  new JPanel             JLabel labFour  new JLabelboyz             four.addlabFour             four.setPreferredSizenew Dimension1000,30             four.setBackgroundColor.blue             panelContainer.addfour             break         default              i0             break                  myScrollPaneContent.revalidate         myScrollPaneContent.repaint       codepre
Positive 6018 pI made an applet that displays a picture, and want to load that applet inside a Frame.  I have been unable to figure out or find online the correct way to implement the AppletStub interface so the Frame and access the applets getDocumentBase and getCodeBase methods.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Here are the three classes  the MyGame applet, the Frame Im trying to put the applet into, and the AppletStub interface.  I think the problem lies in the AppletStub interfaces methods where it returns the applets getDocumentBase and getCodeBase, but Im not entirely sure.

I am new to codeAWTcode, Swing and such and dont know what layout should I use, I know a bit of codeGridLayoutcode and codeBorderLayoutcode which are obviously not suitable in this case. p  pAny ideas p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.commko4A.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.commko4A.png altenter image description hereap
Positive 6018 pI use a codeGridBagLayoutcode and place a codeJLabelcode on it as the picture shows. I managed to set the size of the codeJLabelcode to the desired one via codeipadxcode and codeipadycode but I dont seem to work with the position of it. It seems it is always centered on the middle while Id like to start from the red dot and dont reposition itself as I resize the window. What should I dop  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comFB6I6.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comFB6I6.png altenter image description hereap  pThanks.

Positive 6018 pI am developing a lightweight graphics API for different needs where I want to render the image before it gets displayed. I have overriden the AWTs Component in order to have the highest perfomance. However, if I render the image draw lines, rectangles amp stuff in the codepaintcode method the process of painting becomes visible to the user if the method is being called frequently e.g. the window is being resized, or an animation is being played, and it is quite a perfomanceheavy solution.p  pI decided to cache and render the image separatly and simply copy the pixels to the Graphics object in the codepaintcode method. But now I dont know how to draw a single pixel to the Graphics object. I suppose the underlaying Sun implementation has such method but I should not address that class. I know that Graphics class declares several methods codedrawLinecode, codedrawRectcode, codefillRectcode, etc. that seem lightweight and can be used to only paint one pixel but I dont know which one will be the quickest.p  pI do not want to use BufferedImage due to some memory issues and thus codedrawImagecode is not a solution in this case. It is also not the case asked in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13638793whatisthefastestwaytodrawpixelsinjavathis questiona because, again, I do not use Images and I do not create new instances in the codepaintcode method the rendered image data class only changes when the component is resized.p  pstrongtldrstrong the quickest method in java.awt.Graphics to set the color of some pixel by its coordinates to a specified color java.awt.Color or RGB, last preferred.p  pThank you in advance.p

Positive 6018 pWhat I am wanting to is draw some Shape could be any type of Shape in Java2d such that inside of its border it is all one color, but at the Shapes edge, the color fades to whatever color was behind the Shape over the thickness of the border that I want to apply to it.p  pThe only way I can come up with to do this is to repeatedly draw the border with increasing transparency values starting at width 0 and fully opaque and going to however wide I want the border to be and fully transparent in increments of 1 unit of width.  This is a less than ideal solution, however, because it has rapidly deteriorating performance as the scale is increased and the border needs to be thicker. What I am ideally after is a solution where performance does not degrade linearly with the width of the intended rendered border, as my current naive approach does.p

Positive 6018 pSo I am still quite a newbie when it comes to creating codeJFramecode apps. I have decided to learn a bit more about it by creating a hobby of a project, all has been going pretty well, and I have learnt a lot, but now Im trying to learn how to use codesetIconImagecode for, ya know, the icon in the top left hand corner of the window in Windows, not sure in which corner it is shown on Mac OSX and Linux. I have Googled far and wide, however could not really find anything that worked 100, either it worked in Eclipse, or I got codeNullPointerExceptionscode. From what I understand is that when running the code.jarcode file from your desktop, it would do a search for the icon image by starting at your PCs root directory, and not the code.jarcodes root directory. Anyone got some tips on this that might help I have pasted my source code for the class that handles the codemaincode method for me below, the other classes deal with creating the codeJFramecode, and in this case do the password generation this is part of the tiny password generator app I made for my officep  pSource Codep  precode    public class ShowWindowDemo              private static final String ICONPATH  srcimagespgen.png          public static void mainString[] args                      WindowDemo gui  new WindowDemo             gui.setVisibletrue             gui.setResizablefalse             gui.setIconImageToolkit.getDefaultToolkit.getImage                 ShowWindowDemo.class.getResourceICONPATH             gui.setLocationRelativeTonull             gui.setTitlePassGen v1.0.6               codepre  pMy folder structure for getting to the code.pngcode images is codesrcimagescode. Whenever I try to run my app in Eclipse using the above mentioned source code, it opens fine, but in my console I get a codeNullPointerExceptioncode. I have run the app by usingp  precode    gui.setIconImageToolkit.getDefaultToolkit.getImageICONPATH codepre  pand it works 100 fine.p  pAny assistance on this would be GREATLY appreciated, I am a bit stuck on this one it seems.p
Positive 6018 pI was programming up a nice little utility and all was going well, but then I tried to add some labels.  They showed up.  Then I made them longer and they disappeared. I tried many experiments repositioning, changing font, changing the order but nothing was consistent other than the longer strings were problematic.  Thinking that I was using Swing incorrectly, I tried to simplify by moving back to AWT, but I see almost identical problems.  I have even stepped through the code using jdb and, again, sometimes the g.drawString works on the longer strings and other times it does not. I tried catching any errors and did not see anything as well.p  pClearly, I am missing something fundamental.  Can someone explain  1 why do the shorter strings e.g. label seem to always work 2 why do the longer strings sometimes not show at all 3 are the failures due to the sting not being rendered at all or are they getting overwritten by some other image 4 if 3 is overwritten, how does one control the order of these other unknown imagesp  pI have stripped the code down. I am compiling with javac 1.7.079p  precodeimport java.awt.  public class GraphicsQuestion extends Frame     public GraphicsQuestion            superQuestion  call to Frame        setFocusabletrue        public void DrawLabelsGraphics g            g.setFontnew FontCourier, Font.PLAIN, 16        g.setColorColor.BLACK         g.drawStringlabel, 0, 100        String ss  new Stringlabel1234567890123456789        g.drawStringss, 100, 150         g.drawStringlabel12345, 100, 170 does not print        g.drawStringlabel1, 10, 170         public void paintGraphics g           super.paintg       DrawLabelsg        public static void mainString args[]        GraphicsQuestion gq  new GraphicsQuestion       gq.setBackgroundColor.WHITE       gq.setSize800, 200       gq.setVisibletrue      codepre  pAs the comment in the code suggests, the output is missing one of the labels. At times, it is missing both of the longer labels.  And if I comment out the printing of the label12345, the first time I execute, I am missing the label1234567890123456789 label.  And if I make the label12345 string shorter, like label123 strongeverything is printedstrong.p  pI am used to consistent behavior in my programming. If I am having trouble understanding what is going on with this simple example, I am hesitant to build anything more complicated. Can anyone explain the inconsistent behaviorp  p original question above, what follows is based on answers received p  pThanks to VGR for the quick response. I had been trying to not mix Swing with AWT but I tried the code. It seemed to improve things.  Unfortunately, I have taken it to the next level and added KeyListener functionality and I see the instabilities again.p  pNow I wonder if I have something deeper than a Java error.  Maybe I have some hardware or graphics driver failure because the font can be distorted.  I can compile the code and it will be missing the labels 20 out of 20 times and then recompile strongthe same code the same waystrong and get this distorted output.p  pa hrefhttpwww.screencast.comtrsBjRZlXlWu relnofollowhttpwww.screencast.comtrsBjRZlXlWuap  pI will include my new code below, but this is looking less and less like a Java programming issue and more like an environment issue.

Positive 6018 pI want to save not only Red, Green, Blue and Alpha in my Image. Every pixel also needs ZDepth information, like, how far it was away from the camera. Furthermore, I need to display the Image in a JFrame,  so I cant use my custom Image class, but instead I need a BufferedImage or a subclass of it. The ZDepth shouldnt be visible in the JFrame. I just want to store it.p  pIve read much about the BufferedImage class.  I assume that I will have to extend classes like SampleModel or ColorModel, but I cant figure out how that should be done.

Positive 6018 pIn order to understand my question Ill give you a brief description of my project. Im working on a project that involves an external test bench which has an interface made on the PC in Java AWT. The interface has a main window  HMI with scenarios class therefore a class  that manages the serial connection with the test bench and data reception  transmission by using RXTX library. From the main window the user can select from a list of scenarios to be performed by the test bench.p  pEach scenario has its own class and application window where the user has to enter some timing parameters or press the random generate button. Every time the user presses the random button or enters new values to the fields , The duration of the test is calculated automatically therefore Event listeners with action events are attached to each text box.p  pAfter each test is finished , the test bench signals to the application with a message which  starts a thread in the main window which makes a log with the test resultsbr The problem  p  pAll the actions are performed as a result of Action events  button press  field modification  and the main method has only a thread running in the background and doing nothing.p  pFor each scenarios I create an object whenever the random button is pressed and all its fields are set by the random generate function or timing calculation function. And when I start the thread that performs the log in my main windows class I have to create a new object to start it and therefore al its fields are reinitialized and the data is lost. p  precode    public class Scenario3 extends SerialClass implements Runnable         public JFrame frame         private JTextField accSTARTmin         private JTextField accSTARTsec            public int AccSTARTmin            public int AccSTARTsec             public String accstartmin              public String accstartsec          public volatile boolean suspendFlag false         public Thread S3Thread           public static  void mainString[] args                 EventQueue.invokeLaternew Runnable                  public void run                      try                    catch Exception e                              e.printStackTrace                                                                                      public Scenario3                  initialize                                 Initialize the contents of the frame.                   private void initialize              frame  new JFrameNormal Operation Scenario 3             frame.setBounds100, 100, 928, 591             frame.setDefaultCloseOperationJFrame.DISPOSEONCLOSE             frame.getContentPane.setLayoutnull              accSTARTmin  new JTextField             accSTARTmin.addMouseListenernew MouseAdapter                  Override                 public void mouseClickedMouseEvent arg0                      timingcalculation                                           accSTARTmin.setBounds115, 73, 86, 20             frame.getContentPane.addaccSTARTmin             accSTARTmin.setColumns10              accSTARTsec  new JTextField               accSTARTsec.addMouseListenernew MouseAdapter                  Override                 public void mouseClickedMouseEvent arg0                      timingcalculation                                              accSTARTsec.setColumns10             accSTARTsec.setBounds226, 73, 86, 20             frame.getContentPane.addaccSTARTsec                   .....  other fields               void random              Random randomtimings  new Random              S3 new Scenario3                              S3.AccSTARTminrandomtimings.nextInt1  30     accSTARTmin.setTextString.valueOf S3.AccSTARTmin        S3.AccSTARTsecrandomtimings.nextInt59         accSTARTsec.setTextString.valueOf S3.

Negative 6018 pIm not quite sure if this is possible, or falls into the category of Pivot tables, but I figured Id go to the pros to see.p  pI have three basic tables Card, Property, and CardProperty. Since cards do not have the same properties, and often multiple values for the same property, I decided to use the union table approach to store data instead of having a really big column structure in my card table.p  pThe property table is a basic keywordvalue type table. So you have the keyword ATK and the value assigned to it. There is another property called SpecialType which a card can have multiple values for, such as Sycnro and DARKp  pWhat Id like to do is create a view or stored procedure that gives me the Card Id, Card Name, and all the property keywords assigned to the card as columns and their values in the ResultSet for a card specified.

Negative 6018 pIve got two tables that need to be joined via LINQ, but they live in different databases.

Negative 6018 pso Im writing a VS2008 C AddIn to automate AspectC weaving in C projects.  Im generating the C source files now woven with aspects, but I cant figure out how to compile them as part of the prebuild step.  Is there a convenient way to specify new source within the IDTExtensibility2, EnvDTE90, or VslangProj90 namespaces  Ive tried using the VCProject and VCProjectEngine interfaces as well as marking the files for inclusion programmatically via the ExcludedFromBuild  false flag.  No luck.  p  pI noticed that the commercial AspectC AddIn bypasses cl.exe by putting a wrapper around it and the ac.exe aspect compiler.  So they must call their own cl.exe which then calls ac.exe before preparing the generated source files for the real compiler.  That seems like a hack to me, is there not a better way  Im really stumped on this one, any help would be appreciated.p

Negative 6018 pI have a line in a javascript function that sort an array of objects based on the order of another array of strings.  This is working in firefox but not in IE and i dont know why.  Heres what my data looks like going into the sort call, in IE7.  Im using an array of three items just to illustrate the point here.p  precodecherry first then the rest in alphabetical order originalData  [cherry,apple,banana,clementine,nectarine,plum]  data before sorting  note how clementine is second item  we wan to to to be after apple and banana csub  [   valuecherry,data[cherry],resultcherry,   valueclementine,data[clementine],resultclementine,   valueapple,data[apple],resultapple,   valuebanana,data[banana],resultbanana,   valuenectarine,data[nectarine],resultnectarine,   valueplum,data[plum],resultplum ]  after sorting, csub has been rearranged but still isnt right clementine is before banana. in FF its in the right place. csubSorted  [   valuecherry,data[cherry],resultcherry,   valueapple,data[apple],resultapple,   valueclementine,data[clementine],resultclementine,   valuebanana,data[banana],resultbanana,   valuenectarine,data[nectarine],resultnectarine,   valueplum,data[plum],resultplum ] codepre  pHeres the actual sort codep  precode csubSorted  csub.sortfunctiona,b return originalData.indexOfa.value gt originalData.indexOfb.value  codepre  pCan anyone see why this wouldnt work  Is the basic javascript sort function not crossbrowser compatible  Can i do this a different way eg with jquery that would be crossbrowserp  pgrateful for any advice  maxp  pEDIT  this also fails to work in safari and chrome  in other words, it only seems to work in firefox.p  pSOLVED  thanks to Tim Down. Id actually made my code simpler because i realised that the order that i needed was always the first item in the returned array followed by the rest of the array sorted using .value.  So, i changed my code thusp  precode  first  csub.shift   csubSorted  csub.sortfunctiona,b      return a.value gt b.value       csubSorted.unshiftfirst codepre  pBut, it still wasnt working.  Then Tim below pointed out that sort expects to get a 1, 0 or 1 back from the function, NOT true or false which is what my code was returning.  Obviously firefox lets you get away with this, but the other browsers dont.  All that was required was to translate true or false into 1 and 1 i dont worry about the case where both strings are the samae, effectively that will get returned as 1 which wouldnt make any difference to the sort order anywayp  precode  first  csub.shift   csubSorted  csub.sortfunctiona,b      return a.value gt b.value  1  1       csubSorted.unshiftfirst codepre  pTim also told me that array.indexOf isnt supported in IE which is annoying as even though im not using it here any more i am using it in other bits of code.  Goddamit.  Is there an API page somewhere which definitively lists only the crossbrowser compatible javscript APIp
Negative 6018 pHello ladies and gents, Im having a bit of problem with codeacceptcode. I have a multiple clients and one server. The clients can connect and communicate just fine with server.

The clients have bunch of threads going on, where one of them is codehandleconnectioncode and it has a codewhile1code, looping forever to codelistencode and codeacceptcode whatever incoming connections.

Negative 6018 pI have an application into which I wish to allow users to enter login details for their own websites. One of authentication methods is forms. The way I had envisaged it working, is the users entering the method amp action of their login form, and the namevalue for each credential item, e.g. one for username, one for password. My application would then post this data in order to simulate a login, get the returned authentication cookie and be able to work on their site as if logged in.p  pIn principle, this sounded like a reasonable kind of thing to do. However, as Im sure youre aware, ASP.NET has a lot of inputs, and also hidden ones, e.g. VIEWSTATE, which are all always posted back to the server whenever the ASP.NET form is submitted e.g. when a emrealem user logs in. When my app tries to login however, it doesnt have the full list of inputs on that page, and their values, e.g. the always changing VIEWSTATE.p  pMy question is there a way to post data to an ASPX page, posting emonlyem certain inputs, and excluding others, e.g. VIEWSTATEp  pIf the page were, say, PHP it would probably look like thisp  pEx. 1p  precode... ltdiv idheadergt     ltform actionsearch.php actionPOSTgt         ltdiv idsearchgt             ltinput typetext namequery idSearchQueryText valueSearch query gt             ltinput typebutton namesubmit idSearchSubmitButton valueSearch gt         ltdivgt     ltformgt     ltform actionlogin.php actionPOSTgt         ltinput typetext nameuname idUsername valueUsername gt         ltinput typetext namepasswd idPassword valuePassword gt         ltinput typebutton namesubmit idLoginSubmitButton valueLogin gt     ltformgt     ... ltdivgt ... codepre  pin ASP.NET Web Forms, however, through the use of server controls, itd probably look likep  pEx. 2p  precode... ltbodygt         ltform nameAspNetForm methodpost actionProductsSomethingOrOther.aspx idForm enctypemultipartformdatagt         ltdiv idheadergt             ltdiv idsearchgt                 ltinput typetext idctl00SearchComponentSearchBox namectl00SearchComponentSearchBox valueSearch query gt                 ltinput typesubmit idctl00SearchComponentSearchSubmit namectl00SearchComponentSearchSubmit valueSearchgt             ltdivgt             ltdiv idlogingt                 ltinput typetext idctl00LoginComponentUsername namectl00LoginComponentUsername valueUsername gt                 ltinput typetext idctl00LoginComponentPassword namectl00LoginComponentPassword valuePasswordgt                 ltinput typesubmit idctl00LoginComponentLoginSubmit namectl00LoginComponentLoginSubmit valueLogingt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt         ...     ltformgt ltbodygt ... codepre  pWith example 1, submitting the login form is a simple case of POSTing unamesomethingamppasswdsomethingelse to login.php, however, in ASP.NET, because all inputs are wrapped in a global codeltformgtcode, to submit the login inputs, you have to submit the global form, and therefore all the inputs.p  pSo what Im after, is a way to submit emonlyem certain inputs in that global form, e.g. not VIEWSTATE, which we cant know without probing the page beforehand.p

Negative 6018 pOk.  Please bear with me, I suck at explaining things.p  pI have a database of contact information that is gathered through a form on a website.  Obviously, people press submit more than once accidentally or on purpose, but fixing is a different issue so there are a LOT of duplicate rows in this database.p  pSo, table1 holds contact information as suchp  precodeID    date    unique ID code    first name, blah blah 1      stuff    20110101ba78b      joe codepre  pAnd table2 holds related data joined by the unique ID code field, as suchp  precodeID    data    unique ID code 1      a        20110101ba78b 2      b        20110101ba78b codepre  pSo, table2 holds multiple values for each person.  Thats the structure of the table and there are about a million rows in table2, so Id rather not change the structure right now.p  pSo my dilemma is this  I know its easy to make a temporary table and SELECT DISTINCTall fields, but I want to keep the unique ID field for at least 1 of the duplicate rows.  If I keep the unique ID field though, it is unique for each row, even if the other data is exactly the same so SELECT DISTINCTall fields will not work, it will keep every row.  Hopefully I explained this thoroughly.  Please ask me for more information if needed.p  pEDIT  Im sure I could get rid of the ID field for each table, but as far as Im concerned its just .... there to be there.p

Negative 6018 pI have a CakePHP app which needs to take data from Drupal 6.  Specifically, there is one custom content type and one webform that need to be shared with CakePHP  so when a new node for that content type is added, or a webform submitted, Cake knows about it.  Im not sure the best way to do this, Ive come up with two approachesp  ol liHaving an alternative datasource for the models in question, and read directly from the Drupal database.  However, the Drupal tables are in a Drupally format, which Id rather not write lots of thisModelfinds for  it will be a bit of a pain.  I dont totally understand where Drupal stores everything, either.li liWriting some code in Drupal to save the data in a different format in the CakePHP database.  I dont know how easy this would be  Im more up to speed with Cake than Drupal.  I guess Id use hookformalter and add a function to the form[submit] arrayli ol  pDoes anyone have advice about which of these two would be better, or if theres another option  Im leaning towards the second idea.p  pHelp greatly appreciated, thanksp

Here it isp  precodechar x  charmallocsizeofchar char y  charmallocsizeofchar y  x codepre  pThe problem is when I do it, if X points to a char named HELLO, when i print y it only prints H letter. p  pI want to copy the whole word that char has into a char variable. Also I dont know the sizes of the chars, because they are given by the user. So the length could be anything. I tried strcpy but couldnt managed to solve the problem.p  pAny help appreciated.p  pThanks for all the comments. Now I decided to use stdstring according to your comments. And I guess Im never gonna use malloc again. Now I have to go back to code and change everything according to string and check if everything works.p

I have a complicated objective to minimize subject to complicated nonlinear constraints, all of which are functions of my 3 choice variables, and a wide variety of parameters.

Complicatedconstaints returns a vector of nonlinear inequality constraints for its first argument, and a vector of nonlinear equality constraints for its second.p  pThe reason to do this is so that I can use the objective and nonlin syntax for fmincon objective and nonlin are only functions of x, not of the parameters, because they are subfunctions of a function that has been passed the parameters already.  I believe this is the form I should use in order to pass the gradient and the nonlinear constraints on to fmincon.  My problem is that when I run this code, I get the following errorp  blockquote   pWarning Trustregionreflective algorithm does not solve this type of problem,   using activeset algorithm. You could also try the interiorpoint or sqp   algorithms set the Algorithm option to interiorpoint or sqp and rerun.

Negative 6018 pThis is the scenariop  ol liUser opens a remote desktop session on a server running Windows 2008 Server R2. li liThe remote desktop session does not use mapped drives but clipboard sharing is enabled.li liUser launches MyApplication in the remote desktop session.li liUser opens Windows Explorer on client machine and copies a file to the clipboard.li liIn MyApplication in the remote desktop session user clicks a Save File button. li liMyApplication gets the file from the clipboard and saves it to some directory on the server.li ol  pMyApplication is an old vb6 application, but it is okay to implement this in .Net and use it through com interop. We have tried both the Clipboard class in vb6 and the Systems.Windows.Forms.Clipboard class in .Net.  In either case the only thing that seems to be on the clipboard is the file path on the client machine. This is of no use since the code is running on the server and we need to get the file from the server.p  pWe have also confirmed that this does work when we manually paste the file into Windows Explorer on the server through remote desktop. We did find some examples that show how to do this by running another program on the client, but that is not an option for us. This has to work over just remote  desktop.

Negative 6018 pI have a comboBox jComboBox1 that contains names of all countries in the world...Upon selection of one of the countries a second combobox jComboBox2 is populated with all the states in the country selected in jComboBox1.

Note that Country is a different class and I pass this label to its method populateStates where I use label.setTextLoading details of statestate and do frame.repaint. Thats why I pass the frame object this.  Even then, label does not change.p  pBut the only change that appears in the labels initial text after selection of a country is the last text that it is set to, once countrys selection is over.  Intermediate changes in the label do not appear in the GUI. Whys this happening and whats wrong with my approach  Do I have to use another approach using threads If so, howp

Negative 6018 pI have Serialized Instance Data from a 3rd party application, it is in XML and I want to load it into an object and work with it.p  pI generated a XSD off the the XML and it works great. The XML represents the state of a form the user filled out. The first time I generated the XSD, I hadnt filled out the whole form the form instance being what is serialized. I went back and filled out the whole form, so that all the controls I need are present, and created a new XSD, and used XSD2Code to generate a new class.p  pQuestion is, if I dont know what all of the serialization looks like for the form itself  is my approach flawed from the beginning or is it the best that I can dop  pIs sticking interfaces on the Controls I need on the generated classes a good way to mitigate changes in the characteristics of the underlying instance datap  pI know now that I at least need to be able to work with certain things in the form and they are all present. If in the future more stuff is added to the form, I can regenerate the XSD and build on already present implementation.p  pIs this a sound approach, in that I will create a partial class which specifies on the generated classes that they at least implement the things I needp  pIs there anything you can foresee that will challenge the code that I write that works with these interfaced types in the instance classp  pIs there a way to have my deserialization methods, not break if theres stuff that it isnt expectingp

Negative 6018 pI need to construct a fast lookup table with 8byte integer keys. The table construction is done during initialization and the data is not updated after that. The number of data items is under 100K so I can afford using extra space to make the hash table sparse. However the data lookup has to be as efficient as possible. As far as I understand, Cuckoo Hashing seems like a good fit for this kind of scenario. However, I am not very clear about a few thingsp  ol lipWhat family of hash functions should be used in this case Some papers suggest that the standard ax  b mod p mod m function family is not a good choice. Moreover, p has to be a prime  UInt64.MaxValue, which makes it difficult to compute the function. The multiplyshift ax  w  logm family is not considered a good choice either. I couldnt find a definitive answer on what function to use. pli lipThe insert operation can trigger rehashing. So in theory the insertion time is unbounded in the worst case you just keep choosing a bad function which results in rehashing. I understand, that the probability of this is close to zero but I have hard time simply ignoring this issue in production.pli lipAre there any better data structures for the problem described The a hrefhttpciteseerx.ist.psu.eduviewdocsummarydoi10.1.1.25.4189 relnofolloworiginal Cuckoo Hash papera suggests that a simple linear probing hash can be more efficient when you have enough extra space twothree times the number of items. Also, during the construction phase, I can check if there are more than two keys that collide and choose a different hashing function I can afford doing it a few times and choosing the best one.pli ol  pThanks a lot for your responses.p

Negative 6018 pIm doing a mini project  student database using linked list, part of my first semester. The specification is that, user should be able to search a record using name initials, which is a char[4] in the structure.p  pNow there are two ways to search the initials, one by linear search which is indeed inefficient I dont care actually about that, because this is not going to be some firms basic stuff, etc. or by binary search.p  pBinary search requires sorted arrays, so I was thinking if searching using the ASCII sum of the string would make any sensep  pFor example, record 1 has initial  AB and record 2 has CD. ASCII sums of both are 6566  131 amp 6768  135 and the list is sorted using initials using strcmp.p  pSo when the user inputs AB, Ill just look for the number 131 and if present, show the recordp  pThis might be a very bad idea, please dont flame on me and explain why it is a bad one.p

Negative 6018 pHi I have a viewcontroller in a tabview controller. I decided to use NSNotification to flag when views in the tabview controller need to update their data. Previously each had logic to tred to decided the state of the data model and update accordingly. p  pMy update code calls some stuff that in turn call delegate methods. These were all working when not using notification.p  pMy first attempt at notifying seemed to call the selector before the view controller had initialised before viewDidload at least. Among other thing the delegate methods were never called when the update in the notification selector was run and the view controller didnt get updated. Seems like the viewcontroller is in some unknown state.p  pI ran a test and put the same update code in the viewDidLoad and only called the notification code after the viewDidLoad had been called. This works. p  pMy question is  ,is there another way of preventing the notification selector method being called before viewDidLoad or the object is otherwise correctly initialised.p  pI am using  storyboard so I am not programming the creation of views etc.p  pI hope this is clear  posting a whole bunch of code would not had been any easier.p
Negative 6018 pI have an Android activity that is largely transparent, much like a toast. However it is different from a toast in that while shown, it can be interacted with, e.g. it offers a button you can press.p  pWhat I would like to do is catch amp consume touchscreen input within the display area of my UI, and pass everything else to whatever activity happens to be beneath which may not be my app.p  pIts obviously possible to have one or the other, but is this selective model possiblep  pThis is common in other UI languages but I suspect that this, in particular the selective accept of an event to avoid further processing, is not permitted by the model.p  pSo far Ive had a look at WindowManager.LayoutParams flags amp types, but I cant even get into a state where all input is sent to underlying activities as per a toast.p  pAny thoughts would be appreciated.p

Negative 6018 pIm trying to implement an inapp purchase functionality with the help of the net.robotmedia.billing library.p  pThe purchase of an inapp item managed works the purchase is made, theres an order in google checkout, and later when I restart the device for example, when restoring the transactions the purchase state can be retrieved.p  pWhen I uninstall and reinstall the app, after restoring the transactions the purchase state can be detected. However, this time something probably the Market app sends a Purchase failednotification. The transaction history after a purchase always is 8x codeTransaction.PurchaseState.CANCELLEDcode followed by one codeTransaction.PurchaseState.PURCHASEDcode.p  pThe Purchase failed.notification is sent even though no purchase has been made.

How do I get rid of this notification Or is there perhaps something I might have missed p  pstrongUPDATEstrong The above mentioned cancelled transactions are just the history which is correct. Still the market app I assume sends a Purchase failednotification on RESTORETRANSACTIONS I assume when I receive these cancelled transactions.p  pPerhaps this is not important since a user does not cancel, repurchase, cancel, repurchase, etc. But once a transaction is cancelled, the user will receive this notification whenever the restoring is processed which is annoying and confusing for the user.p

Negative 6018 pI am building a simple WebApplication using servlets. I am a beginner but have tried to learn the most of this technology. There is something I cannot figure out. One of my servlets is the useful BalusC FileServletp  precodehttpbalusc.blogspot.mx200707fileservlet.html codepre  pIt responds to GET requests with the required file, nice and clean.p  pI use this FileServlet to serve CSV files for a Dygraphp  precodehttpdygraphs.com codepre  pI have two types of users guests and admins. Guests should be able to SEE the graph BUT NOT be able to DOWNLOAD the CSV file. Admins should be able to do both.p  pThe fileServlet responds to URLpatterns as file  is the filename, and it is VERY convenient as the Dygraph reads for a file as specified in an URL.p  pThere is a loginServlet built within this webapp, and I want to be able to avoid the fileservlet to GIVE the file if the user just copypastes the URL that is given for the Dygraph. The FileServlet is already capable of getting the session and loggeduser from that session, but I dont know how to detect what was the page that called the GET method. I want the fileservlet to serve the file ONLY when called from within the JSP code, and not from the browsers address bar.p  pLet me explain a bitp  pI mean as a guest user the following Javascript code should display the graph the FileServlet serves the filep  precodeltdiv idgraphdiv2 stylewidth640px height480pxgt ltscript typetextjavascriptgt g2  new Dygraph document.getElementByIdgraphdiv2, messages.rutacsv,  path to CSV file  rollPeriod 10, showRoller true   ltscriptgt             ltdivgt codepre  pThe variable messages.rutacsv gets replaced by the servlet for something that looks like thisp  pfile201204201.csvp  pSo the Dygraph loads the file nicely and plots the lines.p  pBUT, I want the FileServlet to be able to detect when the user copypastes this URL after the ContextName and block it, so only the Dygraph can download the file.p  pFor example, if the user types in his browserp  precodehttplocalhost8080MyWebAppfile201204201.csv codepre  pIt shouldnt be able to download it. Only admins should be able to.p  pNOW, I am thinking that maybe I should implement the FileServlet so it has to be called with another URL pattern or with a POST method so a simple user copypasta cant get past the originingJSP check.p  pBTW, Im coming back from trying with Struts2, which is by far too complicated for this application. I abandoned it for convenience and ease of development with simple servlets and JSPs.p

Negative 6018 pCurrently I am writing a class that will handle animations without the use of actionscript in the timeline for both the main timeline of a symbol and any childrens timeline within that symbol. Each child has an instance name and this all works just fine for anything on the main timeline but the added frame script methods are not being called when the are inserted into any children of the symbol on the main timeline. Here is what my code sort of looks likep  precodeprivate function defaultPlayptargetString, pindexint, pobjMovieClipFunction         return function funcvoid             pobj.gotoAndPlaycommand.actionParameters                   codepre  pthis function is being added to a symbol on the main timeline and each child when a specific label syntax is placed on the frame to insert. Each command has actionProperties which tell it what frame to play.p  pI think the problem is that all the functions are names the same Or i might be wrong about that. please help i can not figure out why that method is not being executed on a child while the parent on the main timeline its working finep  pThanks.p

Negative 6018 pIn my Rails app, I have a codeFoocode model that codehasmanycode codeBarcodes. I want to edit the codeBarcodes inside the codeshowcode view of codeFoocodes controller. Also, I dont want to reload the entire page each time I edit a codeBarcode.p  pTo do this, Im using AJAX. The codeBarcode controller has two views  codeshowcode and codeeditcode. codebarshowcode has an edit button, and both the codeBarcode views, instead of reloading the entire page, use AJAX to perform the HTTP request and then replace the content of the HTML tag that contains that represents that specific codeBarcode object in the codeFoocodes codeshowcode view.p  pWhen rendering codefooshowcode, I dont want to perform an HTTP request for each codeBarcode object. Also, codeBarcodes controller method need to fetch the codeBarcode record from the database  something I dont want to do in codefooshowcode, because I can load all of them with a single query, which is much faster than loading each one separately.p  pSo, what I did is to make codeBarcodes views partials instead of normal views. That way, I can render them both from the controller and from another view.p  pNow, the problem is that those views need more preparation beside loading the codeBarcode record from the database, and unlike loading the record  those preparations need to be done whether the partial is rendered from the controller or from another view.p  pWhat Im doing now is having a ruby block of about 10 lines in the beginning of the partials codeerbcode, and do the preparation there. While that works, I realize its a bad design  that kind of preparation should be done in controllers, not in views. And to make things worse  sometimes, that preparation code of the codeshowcode partial can decide that the codeeditcode partial needs to be rendered instead, so I need to call another partial render from the codeshowcode partial  again, something that should have been done in another place.p  pHowever, I just dont know where to put that code. I thought about putting it a view helper, but view helpers are supposed to be called from views, and I also need to call this one from a controller.p  pSo, whats the RoR way to solve this problemp

Negative 6018 pI have a jQuery Cycle slideshow, consisting of images with additional text used as headline style text. The images fade in, with the text placed in divs animating in and out, roughly at the same time as the images using the before callback method. I am trying to now add previous and next controls. They work, but they immediately advance to the nextprevious slide, because the before callback is on a delay, they dont seem to be triggering the before callback. I am wondering how to get this whole system working, and have the animated text fade in at the same time as the image if I click the previous and next controls.p  pWhat is the best way to tackle this setup Am I on the right path or is there a more efficient and proper way to go about this Code below, thanks in advancep  precodeltdiv idsliderContgt     lta href idprev1 nameprev1gtPREVltagt lta href idnext1 name     next1gtNEXTltagt      ltul idslidergt       ltligt         lta hrefgtltimg srclibraryimagescartarp.jpg gtltagt          ltdiv classcaptionHiddengt           ltdiv classcaptionInnergt             lth2 idslide1headline1gtUnveiling a Revolutionlth2gt              lth3 idslide1headline2gtin Automotive Hospitalitylth3gt              lth4 idslide1headline3gtWhat Makes Us Differentlth4gt           ltdivgt         ltdivgt       ltligt        ltligt         lta hrefgtltimg srclibraryimagespassion.jpg gtltagt          ltdiv classcaptionHiddengt           ltdiv classcaptionInnergt             lth2 idslide2headline1gtProviding the Blueprint Forlth2gt              lth3 idslide2headline2gtPerformance withltbr gt             Passionlth3gt           ltdivgt         ltdivgt       ltligt     ltulgt ltdivgt codepre  pNext, CSSp  precode, html, body  margin0padding 0  sliderCont  height 512px width1200px overflow hidden position relative margintop 30px webkitboxshadow 0 0 7px rgba0, 0, 0, 0.35, inset 0 1px 0 rgba0, 0, 0, 0.2 mozboxshadow 0 0 7px rgba0, 0, 0, 0.35, inset 0 1px 0 rgba0, 0, 0, 0.2 boxshadow 0 0 7px rgba0, 0, 0, 0.35, inset 0 1px 0 rgba0, 0, 0, 0.2  slider  width 1200px height 512px zindex 1 margin 0 padding 0 background ccc overflow hidden  slider li  margin 0  div.caption  display none position absolute top 60px left 60px zindex 2 fontweight lighter   div.captionHidden  display block position absolute top 60px left 60px zindex 2 width1080px  div.captionInner position relative width1080px div.caption span.item  display inlineblock padding 10px fontsize 20px backgroundcolor 2C2C2C webkitboxshadow 0 1px 3px rgba0, 0, 0, 0.25, inset 0 1px 0 rgba0, 0, 0,    0.2 mozboxshadow 0 1px 3px rgba0, 0, 0, 0.25, inset 0 1px 0 rgba0, 0, 0, 0.2 boxshadow 0 1px 3px rgba0, 0, 0, 0.25, inset 0 1px 0 rgba0, 0, 0, 0.2 color E7E7E7  div.caption span.item.second  marginleft 15px margintop 5px  span.sliderhighlight  color 59b5e2   h2slide1headline1  fontsize 79pxtextalign rightfontweight normal color  353534 h3slide1headline2  fontfamily Arial Black, Arial fontsize 32pxtextalign rightfontweight bold color353534 h4slide1headline3  fontsize 18pxtextalign rightfontweight normal color 353534   h2slide2headline1  fontfamily Arial Black, Arialfontweight bold fontsize  32pxtextalignleft color ffffff h3slide2headline2  fontsize 79pxtextalign leftfontweight  normalcolorffffff codepre  pThen our jQuery for the cyclep  precodefunction      slider.cycle         fx fade,         speed 800,         prev prev1,         next next1,         easing easeOutCubic,         timeout 5000,         before onBefore           function onBeforecurr, next, opts          this.children.captionHidden.css             opacity 0,             top 0px                  this.children.captionHidden.animate             opacity 1,             top 60px         , 600, easeOutCubic.delay5000.animate             opacity 0,             top 5px         , 500, easeOutCubic       codepre

Negative 6018 pClearly, frames and frames have some serious problems when used without discretion however, they allow for a certain ability to divide a webpage into essentially two different, nonoverlapping areas. If I were to use p  precode   ltframeset rows40,gt          ltframe srcpage1gtltframegt       ltframe srcpage2gtltframegt    ltframesetgt  codepre  pI could divide my one page between the two framed pages without having to worry about conflicting styles, html tags, etc. p  pI was hired to write an inbrowser server, one which has a small tool bar at the top of the page, and then under it, the proxied webpage. I hate most all things about frames however, I am having trouble replicating their ability to cleanly differentiate between two areas. If I use codeposition fixedcode on my top bar, I then have the problem of interfering with any proxied page below. And likewise, if I attempt to shift the entire proxied page down to make room for the bar, it ends up distorting the style of the proxied page, which is quite unacceptable. p  pSo my question is How can I best manage this situation in terms of either modifying the proxy code to incorporate a top bar, modifying the top bar to not interfere with the proxied page below, or using a feature I am not yet aware of that produces the same effects as the coderows40,code Javascript, PHP, HTML, CSS, etc. are all potential tools to fix this. Also, crossbrowser compatibility is very important. I apologize for not posting code to my proxy, but truncating it would be very difficult. Thank youp

Negative 6018 pI have an assignment where I basically have to write a small botnet. We have been given a list of usernames and encrypted passwords. We have also been given the code to decrypt these passwords. The assignment is to use TCP to crack the passwords in a MasterSlave relationship. The password cracking is like a Dictionary attack in which you compare the encrypted passwords to a dictionary.p  pThis means that a Master Server have to send instructions out to Slaves Clients. These instructions are encrypted passwords, and where in the diciontary to start looking so that different slaves can check different parts of the dicionary at the same time, speeding up the process of decrypting.p  pPersonally I have to take care of the Master. The process works as suchp  pA Master Class starts a Session Class implementing Runnable in a new Thread. The Session makes individual InputStreamListeners Class implementing Runnable for each Slave so that input can be handled on separate threads. When the Slave is done, all the decrypted passwords are sent to the InputStreamListener and added to an ArrayList of strings. This list will then be sent to the Session, and hopefully added to a list of ArrayLists so ArrayList. The Session do receive all the passwords. The Socket gets closed in the InputStreamListener and the Slave shuts down. This to me, would mean that the task for that listener should now be shutdown, and not be in the ExecutorService thread pool any more.p  pWe have only been working with 1 slave at a time, so far. When the InputStreamListener close ends, the code looks like thisp  precodetry          writer.printlnDisconnecting Slave...         scanner.close         writer.close         slave.getSocket.close         Master.messageServerSlave Socket Close      catch IOException ex          Master.messageServer[  ip  ] Problem closing Socket for Slave          Master.messageServer[  ip  ]  ex.getMessage          whiletrue          Master.messageServerTrying Lock         ifsession.lock.tryLock              try                  session.addResultsresults                 Master.messageServerAdded Results to Session.                 break              finally                  session.lock.unlock                            codepre  pThe InputStreamListener reaches the while loop but only prints Trying Lock once. If it was locked this means that the Console should now be spammed with Trying Lock until it can actually reach the method and then print Added results to Session.p  pThe code in the session looks like thisp  precodepublic void addResultsArrayListltStringgt list      lock.lock     try          results.addlist      finally          lock.unlock       codepre  pThe lock is a ReentrantLock.p  pThis is of course done, so that 2 or more InputStreamListeners dont access the method at the same time.p  pI simply cant find out why this happens, and why the program wont work. Logically it seems to be working. Other than this, it just puts the information into a new method to create a txt file. Helpp

Negative 6018 pThe following program will call emfunem 2  MAXD  1 times. The maximum recursion depth should never go above MAXD, though if my thinking is correct. Thus it may take some time to compile, but it should not eat my RAM.p  precodeincludeltiostreamgt  const int MAXD  20  constexpr int funint x, int depth0   return depth  MAXD  x  funfunx  1, depth  1  1, depth  1   int main   constexpr int i  fun1   stdcout ltlt i ltlt stdendl  codepre  pThe problem is that eating my RAM is exactly what it does. When I turn MAXD up to 30, my laptop starts to swap after GCC 4.7.2 quickly allocates 3 gb or so. I have not yet tried it with clang 3.1, as I dont have access to it right now.p  pMy only guess is that this has something to do with GCC trying to be too clever and memoize the function calls, like it does with templates. If this is so, does it not seem strange that they dont have a limit on how much memoization they do, like the size of a MRU cache table or something I have not found a switch to disable it.p  pWhy would I do this I am toying with the idea of making an advanced compile time library, like genetic programming or something. Since the compilers do not have compile time tail call optimization, I am worried that anything that loops will need recursion and even if I turn up the maximum recursion depth parameter, which seems slightly ugly to require will quickly allocate all my RAM and fill it with pointless stack frames. Thus I came up with the above solution for getting arbitrarily many function calls without a deep stack. Such a function could be used for foldinglooping or trampolining.p  pEDIT Now I have tried it in clang 3.1, and it will not leak memory at all, no matter how long I make it work i.e how high I make MAXD. CPU usage is almost 100 and memory usage is almost 0, just like expected. Perhaps this is just a bug in GCC then.p

Negative 6018 pBefore I go asking more questions about the coding, Id like to first figure out the best method for me to follow for making my database.  Im running into a problem with how I should go about structuring it to keep everything minimized and due to its nature I have lots of reoccurring data that I have to represent.p  pI design custom shirts and have a variety of different types of shirts for people to choose from that are available in both adult and child sizes of both genders.  For example, I have crewneck shirts, raglan sleeves, ringer sleeves and hoodies which are available for men, women, boys, girls and toddlers.  The prices are the same for each shirt from the toddler sizes up to 1x in the adult sizes, then 2x, 3x, 4x and 5x are each different prices.  Then theres the color options for each kind of shirt which varies, some may have 4 color options, some have 32.p  pSo lets take just the crewneck shirts for an example.  Men s1x, Women s1x, Boys xs1x, girls xs1x and toddlers NB18months is a total of 22 rows that will be represented in the table and are all the same price.  2X and up only apply to men and women so thats 8 more rows which makes 30 rows total for just the crewneck shirts.  When it gets into the color options, theres 32 different colors available for them.  If I were to do each and every size for all of them that would be 960 total rows just for the crewneck shirts alone with mainly HIGHLY repeated data for just one minor change.p  pI thought about it and figured Its best to treat these items on the table as actual items in a stock room because THEYRE REALLY THERE in the stock room... you dont have just one box of shirts that you can punch a button on the side to turn to any size of color, you have to deal with the actual shirt and tedious task of putting them somewhere, so I deciding against trying to get outrageous with a bunch of foreign keys and indexes, besides that it gets just as tedious and you wind up having to represent just as much but with a lot more tables when you couldve just put the data its linking to in the first table.p  pIf we take just the other 3 kinds of shirts and apply that same logic with all the colors and sizes just for those 4 shirts alone there will be 3,840 rows, with the other shirts left Im not counting in you could say Im looking at roughly 10,000 rows of data all in one table.  This data will be growing over time and Im wondering what it might turn into trying to keep it all organized. So I figured maybe the best logic to go with would be to break it down like the do in an actual retail store, which is to separate the departments into men, women, boys, girls and babies. so that way I have 5 separate tables that are only called when the user decides to go to that department so if theres a man who wants the men shirts he doesnt have 7,000 rows of extra data present that doesnt even apply to what hes looking for.p  pWould this be a better way of setting it up or would it be better to keep it all as one gigantic table and just query the men shirts in the php from the table in the section for men and the same with women and kidsp  pMy next issue is all the color options that may be available, as I said before some shirts will have as few as 4 some will have as many as 32, so some of those are enough data to form a table all on their own, so I could really have a separate table for every kind of shirt.  Ill be using a query in php to populate my items from the tables so I dont have to code so much in the html and javascript.  That way I can set it to codeSELECT ALL  table WHERE typemencode and it will take all the men shirts and auto populate the coding for each one.  That way as I add and take things to and from the tables itll automatically be updated.  I already have an idea for HOW Im going to do that, but I can only think so far into it because I havent decided on a good way to set the tables up which is what Id have to structure it to call from.p  pFor example, if I have all the color options of each shirt all on the same table versus having it broken down and foreign keys linking to other tables to represent them.  that would be two totally different ways of having to call it forth, so Im stuck on this and dont really know where to go with it.  any suggestionsp
Negative 6018 pWhen there is no sorting of subitems selected, what is the default sorting method According to the sitecore documentationp  pIf you do not specify a child sorting rule for an item, Sitecore applies the Default child sorting  rule, and users can sort items manually.p  pand it defines default asp  pDefault Sort items alphabetically by name, not interpreting leading  digits as numbers. Leading underscores sort last. This is  the default child sorting rule.p  pHowever, I have a script that enters a bunch of items, and I just want them to show in the order I entered them in which is essentially the created option  and then I want the user to have control over how they order it after that. Unfortunately, it doesnt preserve the order I entered them in and doesnt seem to be the default either.p  pIf I choose any of the subitems sorting option, then the user cant order it anymore...  how can I do this Is there someway to set the starting sortorder, and then still have the user order the itemsp

Negative 6018 pAn ASP.NET application was developed outside of Visual Studio and contains one aspx pv.aspx file which has both the ASP.NET code as well as the Visual Basic code.  Originally, we compiled the aspx file using a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms22986328vvs.8029.aspx relnofollowthisa method.

Negative 6018 pIve been battling with an issue when playing certain sources of uncompressed YUV 420 planar video data with codeSDLOverlaycode SDL 1.2.5.p  pI have no problems playing, say, strong640x480strong video. But I have just attempted playing a video with the resolution strong854x480strong, and I get a strange effect. The line wraps 12 pixels too late causing a shearlike transformation and the chroma disappears, to be replaced with alternating R, G or B on each line. See a hrefhttpi.imgur.com3OX9bun.jpg1 relnofollowthis screenshotap  pThe YUV data itself is correct, as I can save it to a file and play it in another player. It is not padded at this point  emthe pitch matches the line length.emp  pMy suspicion is that some issue occurs when the resolution is not a multiple of 4. Perhaps codeSDLSurfacecode expects an codeSDLOverlaycode to have a chroma resolution as a multiple of 2p  pAdding to my suspicion, I note that the RGB codeSDLSurfacecode that I create at a size of strong854480strong has a pitch of strong2564strong, not the strong3854  2562strong I would expect.p  pIf I add 1 or 2 pixels to the width of the codeSDLSurfacecode but keep the overlay and rectangle the same, it works fine, albeit with a black border to the right.

Negative 6018 pIve a homework of a code which searches for four numbers in an array whose sum equals to k in this example, k  10. The same array elements can be used more than once. In other words, it sums four elements of the array, compares the sums to value k, and returns true if they are equal, or moves on to other elements if not. So far the code sums four distinct elements of the array but I would need to alter it so that it works also when any single element is used in the sum of four elements more than once, for example if array[2]  4  k or array[0]  2  array[1]  2  k, it returns true. p  pstatic int[][] esim in the code are example inputs. For instance, 1, 2, 3, 4 returns true, because 1  2  3  4  k when k  10. 4, 3, 1, 5, 5, 6, 6 returns false when true is expected, because the code does not take into account duplicated elements and therefore ignores that 2  4  2  1  k. Similarly 2, 3 returns false when true is expected, although 2  2  2  3  k.p  pAnyone could give me a hint how to achieve what I wantp  precodeimport java.util.Arrays  public class Etsinta2       public static boolean etsiint[] tl, int k          Arrays.sorttl         for int i  0 i lt tl.length i              int b  i  1             int c  i  2             int d  tl.length  1             while b lt d                  if tl[i]  tl[b]  tl[c]  tl[d]  k                      return true                  else if tl[i]  tl[b]  tl[c]  tl[d] lt k                      b                     c                  else                      d                                                return false           static int[][] esim  new int[][]5,         2, 3,         1, 1, 1, 1,         1, 2, 3, 4,         4, 2, 3, 1,         4, 6, 5, 5,         6, 4, 5, 5,         6, 6, 6, 4,         4, 4, 1, 1, 1, 6, 6,         9, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 6,         4, 3, 1, 5, 5, 6, 6      public static void mainString[] args          for int[] taulu  esim              System.out.printlnArrays.toStringtaulu   10    etsitaulu, 10              codepre

Negative 6018 pIve trawled the globe for an answer to this, but cannot find anything.p  pI am in the process of rewriting an ASP WebForms application to ASP MVC. Ive been using nInject and for most of the objects this is fine. What Im struggling with is how to surface global application settings for use in every view.p  pThe WebForms app uses a static class with a static constructor that, using an EF context converts the settings table name, value to a dictionary, that the properties then read from.p  pWhat is the best way to do this in MVC Clearly I could still use the static class, but how would I inject the ISettingRepository, as a static constructor has to be parameterlessp  pSorry if this isnt very clear, its kind of difficult to explain p

Negative 6018 pI just deployed an instance of OpenMary TTS server on my Windows 2012 Azure VM and configured ttp endpoints for both port 80 and the default 59125 ports. Ive tried launching mary server using both ports and I cant access it externally using either the DNS name or the external IP. I installed IIS on the same host and I am able to access the default page remotely so I know it is not an Azure configuration issue, rather something in OpenMary causing it to only accept requests coming from the loopback IP or localhost. Is there a hostname setting I can supply on the cmd line via java property I can change its port name via Dsocket.port setting but how do I tweak the host name it listens on Does it make sense to set the server up behind IISp

Negative 6018 pI like to develop business components independent from the application.

This component is responsible for creating, storing, deleting and querying bookmarks. p  pBut there is an important constraint Each user can see his own bookmarks, but he must not see any other users bookmarks.p  ul liThis is confusing me. On one side this is about access control and authorization which are crosscutting concerns, because many components needs them. li liOn the other side this constraint is closely related to bookmarks. Hence it is specific to this component. Maybe its something like a business rule. li ul  pAnyway I am not sure which part of the application is responsible for this.

The information which bookmarks are accessible for a user is stored in my database.p  ol liIs JAAS able to solve this kind of access control  authorization and if yes howli liAre there any patterns that might help meli ol

Negative 6018 pI have an iOS app using a tabBarController.  Each tabs root view is a navigation controller.  In one of the tabs I use a button on the navigation bar to push me to UIViewController that contains a UITextView.  p  pThe problem I am struggling with is that any content added to the UITextView is lost when back button on the navigation bar is pushed.  I have found a few similar questions all with drastically different solutions.  I am not sure how to proceed from here.p  pTo be clear on what I would like to do.  The user can input some text into the UITextView and navigate back to the first view without losing it.

Im just not sure what the appropriatebesteasiest way is.p  pWhat is the best way to accomplish what I am trying to do  I am kind of new to this so Snippets really help p  pstrongUPDATEstrong More pertinent informationp  pThe text in the UITextView is meant to ultimately be posted to a server.

Negative 6018 pFrom information on ensuring data is on disk a hrefhttpwinntfs.com20121129windowswritecachingpart2anoverviewforapplicationdevelopers relnofollowhttpwinntfs.com20121129windowswritecachingpart2anoverviewforapplicationdevelopersa, even in the case of e.g. a power outage, it appears that on Windows platforms you need to rely on its fsync version codeFlushFileBufferscode to have the best guarantee that buffers are actually flushed from disk device caches onto the storage medium itself. The combination of codeFILEFLAGNOBUFFERINGcode with codeFILEFLAGWRITETHROUGHcode does not ensure flushing the device cache, but merely have an effect on the file system cache, if this information is correct.p  pGiven the fact that I will be working with rather large files, that need to be updated transactionally, this means performing an fsync at the end of a transaction commit. So I created a tiny app to test the performance in doing so. It basically performs sequential writes of a batch of 8 memory page sized random bytes using 8 writes and then flushes. The batch is repeated in a loop, and after every so many written pages it records the performance. Additionally it has two configurable options to fsync on a flush and whether to write a byte to the last position of the file, before beginning the page writes.p  precode Code updated to reflect new

results I am obtaining 64 bit Win 7, slow spindle disk are not very encouraging. It appears that fsync performance depends very much on the size of the file being flushed, such that this dominates the time, and not the amount of dirty data to be flushed. The graph below shows the results for the 4 different settings options of the little benchmark app.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.come4aPH.png altBenchmark timing for 4 the scenariosp  pAs you can see, performance of fsync exponentially decreases as the file grows until at a few GB it really grinds to a halt. Also, the disk itself does not seem to be doing a whole lot i.e. resource monitor shows its active time as just around a few percent, and its disk queue mostly empty for most of the time.p  pI had obviously expected fsync performance to be quite a bit worse than doing normal buffered flushes, but I had expected it to be more or less constant and independent of file size. Like this it would seem to suggest that it is not usable in combination with a single large file.p  pDoes somebody have an explanation, different experiences or a different solution that allows ensuring data is on disk and that has a more or less constant, predictable performancep  pstrongUPDATEDstrong See new information in answer below.p
Negative 6018 pIve been trying to increase the performance of my OpenMP solution which often has to deal with nested loops on arrays. Although Ive managed to bring it down to 37 from 59 seconds of the serial implementation on an ageing dualcore Intel T6600 Im worried that cache synch gets lots of CPU attention when the CPU should be solving my problem.

According to a hrefhttpwww.cs.uaf.edu2011springcs641lecture0407loadbalance.html relnofollowthis lecturea on load balancingp  blockquote   pInstead of doing work, the CPUs are busy fighting over the only used cache line in the program.  You can fix this with a very strange technique move the CPUs data apart in memory further than one cache line.

There is also an another issue, when the camera gets very close to a particle, it just starts to move out of the screen in a very strange manner.p  pI believe this could be a bug Or am I just missing something herep

Negative 6018 pI want to prototype a new type of audio filter. At the moment I use GStreamer to return a buffer of my audio, and Cython to apply the filter to it. Then I send the result back to GStreamer.p  pEverything is wrapped in a python main code, the GStreamer accesses are done using a hrefhttppygstdocs.berlios.depygsttutorialpygsta. Using Cython to prototype is great because it automatically recompiles when the code is run, and it very efficient.p  pHowever I feel this would be even better if I could use my Cython files to produce a GStreamer native plugin those are written in C.p  pDo you have an idea on how that could be achievedp

Negative 6018 pI realize variations of this question have been asked and Ive dutifully researched dozens them here and elsewhere, but so far I cant come to a solution. Hopefully Im just missing something and someone in this fine community can help me out. Ive read and tried the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms366709.aspx2022Handling20Null20Data20Using20Data20Source20Controls relnofollowHandling Null Data in Data Source Controlsa MSDN article, but also no luck.p  pHeres my situation. Im using EntityDataSource and a SQL Server database if that matters and I have a main table lets call it Shipments which references various child tables via foreign key. For example, the Shipment table points has a Truck column which references the Truck table.p  pA Truck is not required at the time a Shipment is created. If a user later edits a Shipment to add a Truck, everything works fine. This is done via a DropDownList within a GridView template field, like so Im sorry, I dont know how to format this prettily  Ill edit the post later if I canp  precodeltaspDropDownList IDddlTrucks runatserver AutoPostBackfalse  AppendDataBoundItemstrue                         DataTextFieldNumber DataValueFieldTruckID DataSourceIDesrcTrucks                         SelectedValuelt BindTruckID gtgt                     ltaspListItem Value1 TextSelectgtltaspListItemgt                 ltaspDropDownListgt codepre  pOkay, so in the case where a Truck was not entered during Shipment creation common, the DropDownList populates nicely with Select as the selected item.p  pHOWEVER, if a Shipment references a Truck, and that Truck is later deleted lets say it wrecked and is no longer part of the fleet, thats where I run into issues and get a ddlTruck has a SelectedValue which is invalid because it does not exist in the list of items. Parameter name value error message.p  pPreferably, Id like to head off this exception so it doesnt happen at all. If I must, though, is there a way of catching this exception and fixing the DDL so the page can be displayed and the user can go about their way Howwhere would I catch this So, I suppose my questions arep  ul liIs this a database design issue Should a Delete of a referencedbr entity be handled in some way that Im not doing currentlyli liIs there    a way of preventing this exception from happening at all, like it does when no Truck has ever been entered DDL just displays Selectli liIf I need to catch and handle this exception, how or where would I do soli ul  pJust to clarify, it is strongnotstrong a requirement for the DDL to retain data from the deleted truck. Simply displaying Select, an empty string, or any default value would be fine. The intent is that this should not crash the page, and a user should be able to go about editing other details of the shipment if needed.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated. Ive spent a couple days on this and havent been able to get anything to work If I can provide more information or if I have been unclear in my post, please let me know.p  pThanks so muchp

None of the a hrefhttpconfluence.jetbrains.comdisplayTCD8PredefinedBuildParameterspredefined build parametersa seem to have a local repository path, although Im emhopingem Ive missed one.p  pMy current workaround is to fetch the source emagainem as part of the build just the default branch, of course and then use that to get the log. It works, but it feels insanely wasteful.p  pIts not clear to me how or where TeamCity actually performs the source checkout  Im really hoping theres a local repo emsomewhereem that I can use to get the log.p

Negative 6018 pIn short, the algorithm takes three images source1, source2, hidden. Then it hides the hidden image within source1 and source2 producing output1 and output2. If you place output1 on output2 the hidden image can be seen.

Scroll down to How does this magic work to skip the introduction.p  pEDIT Turns out that setTwo method somehow gains identical blanks. Enforcing and rerandomizing blank2 fixes the problem. However, I still have no idea how do identical data get in there... After all, before calling the setTwo algorithm I always randomize two different numbers.. Anyone sees the reason for it p  pEDIT2 Added checks before every call to setTwo to test if the arguments are equal. The check failed everytime, while the check within setTwo catches the problem.

In this way, when the two are combined, four black subpixels are displayed.                             int randomized  r.nextInt4                             randomized  0 top left                             randomized  1 top right                             randomized  2 bottom left                             randomized  3 bottom right                             this.setThreewidth, height, randomized, outputOne                             int random1  r.nextInt4                             while random1  randomized                                  random1  r.nextInt4                                                          int random2  r.nextInt4                             while random2  randomized  random1  random2                                  random2  r.nextInt4                                                          this.setTwowidth, height, random1, random2, outputTwo                          else                              if sourceOne.getRGBwidth, height  white ampamp sourceTwo.getRGBwidth, height  white                                  the opposite happens when the first layer is white, and the second layer is black                                 int randomized  r.nextInt4                                 randomized  0 top left                                 randomized  1 top right                                 randomized  2 bottom left                                 randomized  3 bottom right                                 this.setThreewidth, height, randomized, outputTwo                                 int random1  r.nextInt4                                 while random1  randomized                                      random1  r.nextInt4                                                                  int random2  r.nextInt4                                 while random2  randomized  random1  random2                                      random2  r.nextInt4                                                                  this.setTwowidth, height, random1, random2, outputOne                              else                                  if sourceOne.getRGBwidth, height  white ampamp sourceTwo.getRGBwidth, height  white                                      int randomized  r.nextInt4                                     int randomized1  r.nextInt4                                     while randomized  randomized1                                          randomized1  r.nextInt4                                                                          this.setTwowidth, height, randomized, randomized1, outputOne                                     int[] remaining  new int[2]                                     int counter  0                                     int number  0                                     while counter  2                                          if number  randomized ampamp number  randomized1                                              remaining[counter]  number                                             counter                                                                                  number                                                                          this.setTwowidth, height, remaining[0], remaining[1], outputTwo                                                                                                                              else                      when the hidden image pixel is WHITE                     the combined two cypher images OR have to have any three subpixels set                     if sourceOne.getRGBwidth, height  white ampamp sourceTwo.getRGBwidth, height  white                          When both source images have a black pixel, this is easy.

Negative 6018 pIm trying to load a model into my project and I get an exception at codeglDrawElementscode.

codeGLvoidoffsetVertex, attributecode, but didnt do anything in the link, the problem was that he was sending memory address in the 4th parameter, and I thought maybe I was sending the wrong parameter

Negative 6018 prails beginner herep  pI am trying to set an app to production but having big issues with the asset pipeline. Under development every asset is generated under codeassetsblabla.extensioncodep  pHowever, I am running nginx and when running rake assetsprecompile it creates assets under codepublicassetscode as it should. But when I visit my app it generates urls like codeapplication.csscode and not codeassetsapplicationdigestq12343.csscode as it should.p  pI think there is an easy fix to this problem.. but I cannot find it. Please help mep  pstrongUpdatestrong From the documentation I read that Sprockets default is assets but it certainly isnt in my application. I use the latest version of rails. Can the documentation be outdated a hrefhttpedgeguides.rubyonrails.orgassetpipeline.html relnofollowhttpedgeguides.rubyonrails.orgassetpipeline.htmlap  pEven if I add codeconfig.assets.prefix  assetscode to my production it would still mean that I would not load the assets since the digest would be missing.p
Negative 6018 pI have a binary script along with a key file and required libs in a folder on my shell. There are 3 users on the shell currently whom I want to allow to run the binary script. Each user who runs it runs it as a separate instanceprocess. In order to start, the script is run by using an .sh file which specifies the location of the binary and its libs. For example, .script.sh is the command.p  pI have the script currently in homescriptuser will create also dir called user2 for other user where script is a new user I created for it. User runs the .sh from their homedir and then it automatically writes a config file in homescriptuser. I have been playing around with chmod because I dont want anyone to be allowed to steal the script or any of its contents inside the directory. To summarize, I only want users to be able to execute the binary and read the libs and key file as well as write their config to respective user directory in homescript. I dont want to allow them to delete, edit, copy, or download anything inside the script directory. Currently only the binary cant be altered in anyway, but the key file and libs are able to be copied or downloaded. I couldnt figure out how to chmod the key and libs so that they cant be copied etc, only read to run binary successfully.p  pPlease let me know how I can accomplish my permission goals andor if there is another or easier way to do this. Thanks.p

Negative 6018 pI have a winforms application in which I have used many Custom Controls like buttons, panels and tabs. And the panels will be used almost for every layout in the Application.

However there is no crash of the application. But the application freezes a lot in XP. The framework version Im using is .Net 3.5 and Im installing .Net 3.5 framework on the machine when the application installsusing NSIS.p  pThe application I have compiled for x86 so that it can run on any bit machine. As far as I know I have covered every possible thing. But still Im facing this issue. Is there something obvious that Im missingp  pIs there any issue with my Application regarding XPp  pPS Eventhough Microsoft has terminated support for Windows XP I still have to launch the application for XP users.p  pThanks in Advancep

Negative 6018 pI want to use spring 4 with minimal xml configuration for the now new project I am about to develop. I will be using Spring in this project for dependencyinjection, mvc, security and jdbc. I will use JOOQ for query generation. Yes, I need to project to support Postgresql and oracle maybe, in future, this app will extended support for REST too. The problem I face now is my production application server is JBoss5.1.0.GA, which obviously does not support servlet 3.0. Now I have a working spring 4 mvc code base with servlet 2.5, but I could not figure out how to configure the security with java config. Because I see most of the examples on spring 4 on servlet 3.0 versions, and very less not good examples on 2.5. Though I read the spring security from the spring website, it made little difference on implementing it. Have anyone implemented security dbldap on servlet 2.5 Share with me your wisdom and experiences.p

Negative 6018 pOk, how do I deploy a Rails app with Capistrano to a production or staging server which has strongno access to an external networkstrong or repository p  pIm more or less of a newbie in Rails, so please dont downvote this question if the answer is obvious. p  pIve managed to get half way through the deployment and realised that capistrano doesnt download the git repo on my stronglocal machinestrong, but it first connects to the strongremote serverstrong and it tries to download the git repo there. p  pI would have expected a javaeelike build system in which a deliverable is created and that deliverable is sent to the server. Just like you would build the .ear file and deploy it on whatever server you want to. Apparently in RoR you are forced  as far asa I can see  to build the app on that server, create a gem repository there, clone the latest branch there and so on. p  pIs there any way to send an readytorun package to the remote server p

Negative 6018 pI am supporting a solution which acts as an IDP and STS in one. Think of it as a MVC app with simple authentication against locally stored profiles. I would like to put a link on one of my pages that, when clicked, builds a SAML payload and ships it through ACS and then on to a partners site which in turn uses WIF to read incoming SAML2 payloads from ACS. I dont want to show another login page such as ACSs home realm discovery page during the journey because by the time they are clicking my link they have already been authenticated. I just want to send claims to the destination Relying Party url and I want to pass through ACS on the way there.p  pACS supports something close to this with custom login pages. You can download an HTML page that you would presumably customize and host at an IDP and have users click through when heading to the  Relying Party. The HTML file sources an ACShosted Javascript file IdentityProviders.js that provides a LoginUrl as one of the JSON parameters it sucks down. LoginUrl contains a wctx parameter that looks to be encrypted or something that I copy and then use like thisp  precodeprivate SignInRequestMessage GetSignInRequestMessage      SignInRequestMessage aMessage  new SignInRequestMessagenew Urihttpssomething.accesscontrol.windows.net, httpaccesscontrol.windows.net     aMessage.Reply  httplocohost65447HomeSAML     aMessage.Realm  httpssomething.accesscontrol.windows.netv2wsfederation     aMessage.Context  THEWCTXPARAMIGRABBED      return aMessage  codepre  pThe end result is that my link click carries me all the way through to the landing page within the Relying Party codehttplocohost65447HomeSAMLcode in this case, passing through ACS which allows for claim mapping and filtering and signature and encryption support.p  pI notice that when I change the Return URL in the corresponding Relying Party the wctx value is changed just slightly. My guess is that it contains the realm and return urls, though I dont understand why it needs that because I can provide those data bits programmatically as seen above. My goal is to be able to build that wctx parameter programmatically without having to grab a magic string or a hrefhttpwww.cloudidentity.comblog20120621takingcontrolofthehrdexperiencewiththenewwif45toolswithalittlehelpfromjquery2 relnofollowmakea an a hrefhttpleastprivilege.com20120622takingcontroloverazureaccesscontrolservicehrdwithoutthehelpfromjquery relnofollowHTTP calla at a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma1707945331299runtimea.

Negative 6018 pIve been looking at the documentation for spark and it mentions thisp  blockquote   pSparks API relies heavily on passing functions in the driver program   to run on the cluster. There are two recommended ways to do thisp      pAnonymous function syntax, which can be used for short pieces of code.   Static methods in a global singleton object. For example, you can   define object MyFunctions and then pass MyFunctions.func1, as followsp blockquote  precodeobject MyFunctions    def func1s String String   ...    myRdd.mapMyFunctions.func1  codepre  blockquote   pNote that while it is also possible to   pass a reference to a method in a class instance as opposed to a   singleton object, this requires sending the object that contains that   class along with the method. For example, consider p blockquote  precodeclass MyClass       def func1s String String   ...       def doStuffrdd RDD[String] RDD[String]   rdd.mapfunc1     codepre  blockquote   pHere, if we create a new MyClass and call doStuff on it, the map inside there   references the func1 method of that MyClass instance, so the whole   object needs to be sent to the cluster. It is similar to writing   coderdd.mapx gt this.func1xcode.p blockquote  pNow my doubt is what happens if you have attributes on the singleton object which are supposed to be equivalent to static. Same example with a small alterationp  precodeobject MyClass       val value  1      def func1s String String   s  value        myRdd.mapMyClass.func1  codepre  pSo the function is still referenced statically, but how far does Spark goes by trying to serialize all referenced variables Will it serialize codevaluecode or will it be initialized again in the remote workersp  pAdditionally, this is all in the context that I have some heavy models inside a singleton object and I would like to find the correct way to serialize them to workers while keeping the ability to reference them from the singleton everywhere, instead of passing them around as function parameters across a pretty deep function call stack.p  pAny indepth information on whathowwhen does Spark serialize things would be appreciated.p

Negative 6018 pRecent bug report states that a method being called is crashing the service causing it to restart.  After troubleshooting, the cause was found to be an obnoxious Oracle SQL call with thousands of strings passed.  There is a collection of strings being passed to a method from an external service which often is more than 10,000 records.  The original code used a where clause on the passed collection using the LIKE keyword, which I think is really, really bad. p  precodepublic IListltContainerStategt GetContainerStatesIListltstringgt containerNumbers      string sql       String.FormatSelect CTNRNO, CNTRSTATE FROM CONTAINERS WHERE CTRNSEQ  0 AND 0,          string.JoinOR, containerNumbers                 .Selectitem gt string.Concat cntrno LIKE , item.SliceLeft10,            return DataBase.SelectQuerysql, MapRecordToContainerState, new  .ToList  codepre  hr  pClarification of in house methods used which may be confusingp  pDataBase.SelectQuery is an internal library method using generics which gets passed the sql string, a function to map the records to .NET objects, and the parameters being passed and returns an IEnumerable of Objects of type retuned by the Mapping function.  p  pSliceLeft is an extension method from another internal helper library that just returns the first part of a string up to the number of characters specified by the parameter.  p  hr  pThe reason that the LIKE statement was apparently used, is that the strings being passed and the strings in the database only are guaranteed to match the first 10 characters.  Example XXXX0000001 in the strings being passed should match a database record like XXXX0000008. p  pI believed that the IN clause using the SUBSTR would be more efficent than using multiple LIKE clauses and replaced the code withp  precodepublic IListltContainerRecordgt GetContainerStatesIListltstringgt containerNumbers      string sql   String.FormatSelect CTNRNO, CNTRSTATE FROM CONTAINERS WHERE CTRNSEQ  0 AND 0,                string.FormatSUBSTRCNTRNO, 1, 10 IN 0 ,                              string.Join,, containerNumbers.Selectitem gt string.Format0,  item.SliceLeft10                                                    return DataBase.SelectQuerysql, MapRecordToContainerState, new  .ToList  codepre  pThis helped slightly, and there were fewer issues in my tests, but when there are huge amounts of records passed, there is still an exception thrown and core dumps occur, as the SQL is longer than the server can parse during these times.  The DBA suggests saving all the strings being passed to a temporary table, and then joining against that temp table. p  pGiven that advice, I changed the function top  precodepublic IListltContainerRecordgt GetContainerStatesIListltstringgt containerNumbers      string sql             CREATE TABLE T1cntrnum VARCHAR210         DECLARE GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE SESSION.T1 NOT LOGGED         INSERT INTO SESSION.T1 VALUES containerNumbers          SELECT                  DISTINCT    cntrno,                              IT cntrstate          FROM                  tbmaster          WHERE                  cntrseq  0              AND cntrstate IN 0             AND adjustment ltgt adjustment             AND SUBSTRCTNRNO, 1, 10 IN SELECT CNTRNUM FROM SESSION.T1           var parameters  new                      containerNumbers  containerNumbers.Select item gt item.SliceLeft10.ToList              return DataBase.SelectQuerysql, MapRecordToContainerState, parameters.ToList  codepre  pNow Im getting a ORA00900 invalid SQL statement.

Negative 6018 pI posted this in a different question several weeks ago and did not receive any response that would help me resolve it.p  pI have an iOS application where I receive push notifications through APNS.p  pWhen the app is in the foreground, push notifications triggered to APNS work 100 correctly.  The correct delegate method is fired, and everything works as expected.p  pNow, if the user presses the home screen and goes to the iOS home screen or goes into any other app, the push notifications for my app stop working.  Upon triggering a push notification, nothing happens on the device.  If the user returns to the app app in the foreground, push notifications start working again.p  pMy understanding when my app is in the background, no application logic actually executes on receiving a push notification.  Therefore, I am beat in terms of how I should solve this.  It obviously cannot be a code issue.  If it was a code problem, the app would be failing to register for push notifications.  However, thats not the case since push notifications do work when my app is in the foreground.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 6018 pIm using a C program to send OSPF packets over to a router in GNS3. Im using a socket raw to communicate with the router. The problme Im having is, even though I can receive the packets generated by the router, the packets my program sends, do not seem to reach the router. Ive tried using a tap interface, which made it possible to ping the router but my packets still didnt seem to be received by the router. p  pI then proceeded to try to create two routers, and compare their packets to mine, and verify whether the one I was generating had something wrong, but I couldnt have two routers using the same tap interface. So I had one connected to the tap interface, and the other to my eth0 interface, and only the packet in the eth0 interface received the packets, the other one did not. p  pIm using Ubuntu 14.04, and GNS3 to simulate the routers, which are directly connected to a cloud, on which I configured the tap and eth0 interfaces.p  pCan someone please help me understand how to set up this p

Furthermore, the before blocks in the outermost nesting get run more times than then inner codebeforecode blocks, unnecessarily slowing down the test suite.p  pstrongSo, is there perhaps a more elegant way to handle thisstrong Im able to clean things up slightly by using codesharedexamplesforcode, codeitbehaveslikecode, codesharedcontextcode, codebeforeallcode, helper methods, etc. But it seems rather awkward when all I want to do is run the tests procedurally without each test needing to run in isolation. In other words, Im looking for a test DSL like thisp  precode Step 1 test Sign in do    visit signin    fillin whatever      ... end   Step 2 test Update profile, after Sign in do     Runs after Sign in sharing same context so variables and object states arent reset end codepre  pAnd yes I know in principle tests run in isolation, but lets be fair, doing so isnt always practical when each step in the test may rely on the outcome of a prior test. p

Negative 6018 pI am making a proof of concept for an app, using Rails 4 and Postgresql. I am thinking on the best way to handle the relation between Products and SubProducts.  A Product have a name, a description... and a SubProduct could have multiple fields too. A Product have many SubProduct, a SubProduct belongs to one Product.p  pI have some Products and SubProducts with hundreds of fields. So I think it is best to not use STI to avoid thousands of null value.p  pAlso I am working with remote designers, I would like to keep it simple for them. So when they want to display the value of a field from a sub product, they would write something like product.name from Product table or product.whatever field from SubProduct table.p  pMy question is how to handle this  For the moment, I was thinking to delete the Products table and to make multiple SELECT to db, one for each SubProducts table. But maybe there is a solution to keep the Products table  Or maybe I can take advantage of table inheritance from Postgresql p  pThank you p

Negative 6018 pUsing ALAsset, I get a nil answer for a lot of pictures fetched from iCloud in my app when calling the method  defaultRepresentation. However, when I call thumbnail I get the associated small picture.p  pIt mostly happens when the picture has just been added on iCloud from another device. My assumption was that the picture was not fully synchronised yet.p  pIve read that in this case, I need to subscribe to the ALAsset notifications, thus I could know when the picture is downloaded and update my UI. But some of them are never correctly downloaded, even if I relaunch my app, still nothing.p  pThe strange workaround that I found is going in iPhoto and open the pictures in full screen on the device. The issue disappear only for the pictures I opened but remains for the others.p  pFinally, someone here wrote that its possible to force the download by calling requestDefaultRepresentation but this method is not in the Apple documentation so an app using it could be rejected.p  pMy question is  Is there an authorised method to fetch those pictures without asking the user to go in iPhoto p

Negative 6018 pI am running Entity Framework 6.1.2 and I appear to have gotten myself into a bind.  I am using the Code First approach.p  pI had a web site using a single database with two tables working just fine, both locally and when deployed on Azure.  I then tried adding a new model and thats when things fell apart.  I gave up on code first migrations because after a few hours of reading and trying the numerous steps necessary inside the Package Manage Console 3 steps per db context, the generated migration files always came out wrong.  Usually empty, with no code at all in the UpDown methods.p  pThats when I tried a manual approach.  First I tried deleting and recreating the database on Azure.  At first I thought that worked, but for some odd reason only the two original tables were recreated by Entity Framework.  The new table, and the child table it EF automatically due to a nested class in the new model, were not created.p  pOut of frustration I created the two new tables manually by copying the SQL query for the new table and child table from the SQL Designer window, and then executing those two queries against the Azure server.  That worked and I did create the tables successfully on my Azure SQL server instance.  However, my web site code can not connect with the new tables.  It can connect to the two old tables, but emnotem the new one and its child table.p  pRemember, this code executes fine locally, but when run on Azure, any queries against the new table fail with the following vague error messagep  pemERROR A networkrelated or instancespecific error occurred while establishing a connection to SQL Server. The server was not found or was not accessible. Verify that the instance name is correct and that SQL Server is configured to allow remote connections. provider SQL Network Interfaces, error 52  Unable to locate a Local Database Runtime installation.

Negative 6018 pI am attempting to improve a a hrefhttpwww.swag.uwaterloo.cabash2py relnofollowBash to Python translatora.p  pBash allows codecode and codecode while Python does not.  Many people have suggested that codexcode can be rewritten as codex  1code.  But this ignores the requirement that one be able to recover the resulting value of codexcode before or after incrementing  decrementing as part of a potentially complex bash expression eg p  precodex y  z. codepre  pI can find no way of converting the above to a python expression, because it appears python does not allow side effects such as assignment within an expression.  A fall back would be to write a prepost function that took a variable or string as input, and altered its external item so passed to the function.  But I cant work out how to have a function alter its input parameter variables.p  pIf I knew that the item being operated on was always an atomic value, I might be able to alter it by mapping its string name to the dictionary to recover this value and so modify it.  But codecode has to work with anything bash might throw at it eg codey[1]code. p  pIs there any way of avoiding having to take such complex bash expressions containing assignments, and break them into separate python steps that build up the overall computation performed in bash, statement by statement.  This would be pretty ugly.p  pI just need to implement call by reference somehow in python.p

What I do not understand is howwhy the handleRequest method would be swapping foreign keys on update.p  pAlso  in many cases  the form will persist fine for a user. I hate to use the word random here but I have not been able to identify a way to duplicate the issue other than just working with the entity for a while and performing CRUD operations on it. Many times the form persists fine  other times the foreign key references get swapped and I am unable to submit the form to update the entity because of the UNIQUE constraint.p  pHas anyone experienced similar issues or have some insight on why this might be occurring Is this a bug in the handleRequest method This will occur even if I have not made any changes to the List Item collection. As in  if I edit a user and simply submit the form without making any changes  this behavior will still occur.p  pIs there a better way to do thisp

Negative 6018 pHaving been working on JavaScript and Angular for the last year, I am currently working on a project in Winforms. I understand the cross thread issue with UI controls InvokeRequired, but I havent worked with BindingList before so to experiment I have a basic app that has a Form, Controller, and POCO that implements INotifyPropertyChanged. The Form gets injected with the controller, which has a BindingList. To simulate an outside thread manipulating the data, I have a Start method inside the Controller that creates a thread and runs a loop and updates the stock list. Obviously, this will raise the property changed event, which notifies the Grid and its datasource, however I get the cross thread exception. What I want to know what is the common practice for this My past experience has been threads started from the GUI background worker and so the code is usually already in the Form and has access to this to call InvokeRequired on. However when using BindingList from a Controller I dont have that.p  pstrongForm1Controllerstrongp  precodepublic class Form1Controller      public bool IsRunning  get private set       private readonly Random Random  new Random      public Form1Controller              Stocks  new BindingListltStockgt                    Stocks.Addnew Stock                      Name  Microsoft,             Ticker  MSFT,             Price  25,             Volume  100000,             LastTraded  DateTime.Now                  Stocks.Addnew Stock                      Name  Google,             Ticker  GOOG,             Price  450,             Volume  100000,             LastTraded  DateTime.Now                  Stocks.Addnew Stock                      Name  Apple,             Ticker  AAPL,             Price  750,             Volume  100000,             LastTraded  DateTime.Now                  Stocks.Addnew Stock                      Name  Oracle,             Ticker  ORCL,             Price  80,             Volume  100000,             LastTraded  DateTime.Now                    public BindingListltStockgt Stocks  get set       public void Start              IsRunning  true          new Thread gt                       while IsRunning                              var index  Random.Next0, Stocks.Count                  Debug.WriteLineindex                  var stock  Stocks[index]                 stock.Price  1                 stock.Volume  500                 stock.LastTraded  DateTime.Now                  Thread.Sleep100                                      .Start                       public void Stop              IsRunning  false       codepre  pstrongStockstrongp  precodepublic class Stock  DependencyObject              private string name     public string Name              get  return name          set  SetFieldref name, value,  gt Name            private string ticker     public string Ticker              get  return ticker          set  SetFieldref ticker, value,  gt Ticker            private int price     public int Price              get  return price          set  SetFieldref price, value,  gt Price            private long volume     public long Volume              get  return volume          set  SetFieldref volume, value,  gt Volume            private DateTime lastTraded     public DateTime LastTraded              get  return lastTraded          set  SetFieldref lastTraded, value,  gt LastTraded           codepre  pstrongDependencyObjectstrongp  precodepublic class DependencyObject  INotifyPropertyChanged      public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged      protected virtual void OnPropertyChangedstring propertyName              PropertyChangedEventHandler handler  PropertyChanged         if handler  null                       handlerthis, new PropertyChangedEventArgspropertyName                   protected bool SetFieldltTgtref T field, T value, string propertyName              if EqualityComparerltTgt.Default.Equalsfield, value return false         field  value         OnPropertyChangedpropertyName         return true           protected virtual void OnPropertyChangedltTgtExpressionltFuncltTgtgt selectorExpression              if selectorExpression  null             throw new ArgumentNullExceptionselectorExpression         MemberExpression body  selectorExpression.Body as MemberExpression         if body  null             throw new ArgumentExceptionThe body must be a member expression         OnPropertyChangedbody.Member.Name           protected bool SetFieldltTgtref T field, T value, ExpressionltFuncltTgtgt selectorExpression              if EqualityComparerltTgt.Default.Equalsfield, value return false         field  value         OnPropertyChangedselectorExpression         return true       codepre  pstrongForm1strongp  precodepublic partial class Form1  Form              private readonly Form1Controller Controller  new Form1Controller      public Form1Form1Controller controller              InitializeComponent          Controller  controller         MainGrid.DataSource  Controller.Stocks           private void StartButtonClickobject sender, EventArgs e              Controller.Start           private void StopButtonClickobject sender, EventArgs e              Controller.Stop           private void Form1FormClosingobject sender, FormClosingEventArgs e              Controller.Stop       codepre  pHow do I marshal the property changed back onto the UI thread from the BindingList assuming that is what I should be asking forp

Negative 6018 pIm trying to calibrate two cameras using OpenCVs FindFundamentalMat on a bunch of points  compute essential matrix  SVD to find possible values for R and T. p  pAs a comparison, Im first using OpenCVs builtin stereo calibration with a checkerboard. The results are quite good with this method.p  pThe problem is when I try to reproduce the results found with stereo calibration. I am using the same checkerboard corner positions in both methods. First, the fundamental matrix found by findfundamentalmat is different than the one returned by stereo calibration. When computing E and subsequently R and T, the translation is off by a lot not accounting for scale.p  pIf I use the fundamental matrix returned by stereo calibration to find E, R and T, then all matrices are similar to what stereo calibration returns, so I guess the error must be somewhere in my use of FindFundamentalMat.p  pAnyone have an idea what Im doing wrong My workflows are as followp  pFor stereo p  ul liFind chessboard corners subpixli liCall stereo calibration  K1, K2, D1, D2, R, T, E, Fstereoli ul  pSanity check p  ul liFrom Fstereo find E  K2FK1li liDecompose E  find R1, R2, t1, t2 these are similar to the ones found aboveli ul  pFor fundamental p  ul liFind chessboard corners subpixli liUndistort points using K1, K2, D1, D2 with Reye3, PKli liFind fundamental mat from set of points is different than Fstereoli liFind E  K2FK1li liDecompose E  find R1, R2, t1, t2 these are different than the ones aboveli ul

Negative 6018 pApologies if this is not an appropriate question, or if it is answered elsewhere, but I have done quite a bit of searching and I think I must be searching for the wrong thing...p  pIm sure that in R Studio, you used to be able to click on a function which is in the Environment, to view it and see what it does.  It was really easy and convenient.  It doesnt work anymore.  Is there another way to do this just by clicking, or is the only option to run the name of the function to get it to print in the console  Im sure that it used to give a popup window where you could see the syntax highlighting and things too, which was really useful p

Negative 6018 pIve run into a situation where an API built on a hrefhttpsgithub.comflaskrestfulflaskrestful relnofollowFlaskRestula intermittently becomes nonresponsive. Currently its running from Werkzeug which Im aware is for nonproduction use only and single threaded. To complicate things a little further this is also all wrapped up inside axscript within another application.p  pWhen nonresponsive, a significant number of sockets show in the codeCLOSEWAITcode so theres something not being handled correctly during a client initiated socket teardown.p  pAs this is running single threaded it appears that the internals of a request handler may be blocking indefinitely preventing other requests from being accepted and ultimately causing the client timeout. However, as the thread is busy this prevents the socket from actually closing.p  pDoes this sounds like a sane assumption based on knowledge other have of the framework Also, if an unhanded exception is thrown within a request handler, will this always result in a 500 error being returned, or is there some other scenario here Im missingp

I have looked around stack overflow to see if it is possible to execute python scripts in a website, and the consensus seemed to be that I will require a server that executes python, and then make HTTP requests to my server.p  pUnfortunately, Im quite a junior developer and lack a lot of understanding regarding web dev, and my attempts to dive in have left me with more questions than answers. We have a deadline that is approximately 3 days from now, and the only part that remains is to set up a server that can execute a specific python script upon HTTP requests.p  pI think that the source of my confusion is a lack of understanding regarding how exactly a server works, and was hoping that the kind folks here at stack overflow could help me inp  p1 better understanding whats going on under the hood on the server side after an HTTP request arrives or better yet, how does an HTTP request even arrive at allp  p2 Explain to me like Im 5 what Ill need to do to deploy my website  namely all the inbetween steps that receive little attention from the other posts here at stack overflow.p  pSome example questions that run through my head are belowp  pWhat type of server will I need p  pHow will I know if it can run Python p  pHow does the server know that I want to execute a certain script, while upon a user entering a my websites homepage URL, land at the home screen p  pIve also read up on middle layers such as CGI  what does this accomplishp  pIs setting up a server reinventing the wheel  codeenter code herecode Is there already a service out there that does what Im looking forp

Negative 6018 pWere building a system that will be sending messages from one application to another via JMS Using Websphere MQ if that matters. These messages are of the form Create x or Delete x. The end result of this is that a thirdparty system needs to be informed of the Create and Delete messages, so the Read end of the JMS queue is going to talk to the thirdparty system, whilst the Write end of the JMS queue is just broadcasting messages out to be handledp  pThe problem that were worried about here is if one of the messages fails. The initial thought here was simply to roll the failures back onto the JMS queue and let the normal retry mechanism handle it. That works until you get a Delete followed by a Create for the same identifier, e.g.p  ul liDelete 123  Fails, gets rolled back on to the queueli liCreate 123  Succeedsli liDelete 123  Retry from earlier failureli ul  pThe end result of this is that the third party was told to Create 123 and then immediately to Delete 123, instead of the other way around.p  pWhilst not ideal, from what Ive been reading up on it seems that Message Affinity would help here, so that we can guarantee that the messages are processed in the correct order. However, Im not sure how message affinity will work when messages are processed and failed back onto the queue Message Affinity is generally considered a bad idea, but the load here isnt going to be great, and the risk of poison messages is very low. Its simply the risk that the thirdparty that were interacting with has a brief outage that were concerned withp  pFailing that, are there any better thoughts on how to do this p  pEdit  Further complications. The system were building to integrate with the thirdparty is to replace a system they used from a different supplier until recently. As such, theres a bunch of data that is already in the thirdparty, but it turns out to be very difficult to actually get this out. The thirdparty doesnt even send successfailure messages back, merely an acknowledgement of receipt, so we dont actually know the initial state of the system. p

Negative 6018 pI have been working on a solution for identifying display devices telivisions in my case to keep the main layout which is especially designed to use multimonitors.p  pLets say I have 6 televisions connected. usually 3 of them via HDMI ports and other 3 via DVI port using DVItoHDMI adapter and their physical locations are 3x2 like thisp  pstrongTV1 ... TV2 ... TV3strongp  pstrongTV4 ... TV5 ... TV6strongp  h2The Goalh2  pI want to display some fullscreen content on each specific television. Content1 must go to TV1, Content2 must go to TV2 etc...  In other words strongI need to push my content to the DisplayDevice television  not to any Location or Screenstrong because they can change due to Windows behavior. see belowp  pAs you may know, Windows does not enumerate the display devices in the order you connect them or in fact not based on any rule at all. It uses a total different way to enumerate displays, for examplep  pstrong.DISPLAY3 ... .DISPLAY6 ... .DISPLAY1strongp  pstrong.DISPLAY4 ... .DISPLAY2 ... .DISPLAY5strongp  pstrongWhat I do to get over thisstrong, I order the televisions in Display Settings manually when Im finished connecting all of them to match with their real locations.p  h2The Issueh2  pBut there s a problem here Some television models just pretend like they ve been unplugged when theyre switched off or set to standby mode and that causes Windows to strongdropstrong the display device from the system and strongreenumeratestrong the display devices all over again. p  pBecause of this behaviour of both some television models and the Windows itself I can not count on strongScreen.DisplayNamestrong property or even strongScreen.Locationstrong because they strongare variablesstrong. They both change right after the reenumeration process.p  h2Solutions that Ive tried so farh2  pI ve tried to get the serial numbers of all display devices, thinking that I could find a way to correlate those numbers with the Screen.DisplayName. Well, I actually managed the get there by using SetupAPIs, EnumDisplayDevices but this all went to garbage after Ive realized that most of the televisions does not have a valid SerialNumber. Even the Samsung TV does not have a SerialNumber but a Samsung monitor certainly does  so I guess its about the difference between a monitor and televisoinp  h2After all..h2  pIm still looking a way to get over this issue.  The other idea that comes to my mind is, maybe I should stop trying to push the content to the Display Device because they are unidentifiable Maybe I should try to push the content to the graphic cards ports, which means I must determine which ports of graphic cards correlates to which display device Screen but I am all talking without any knowledge about it  without even knowing if such a thing is possible or not. p  pIm looking for your advices, thanks by now.p

Negative 6018 pI have implemented a GCM service on an iOS app. I use PHP to send GCM at the server. It works perfectly when the app is signed by a development provisioning profile. p  pThat is, when the app registers itself using the GCM Config, it always returns a functioning device token. I can send a notification to the device using the token without any error.p  pBut after I sign the app by distributed provisioning profile and test the app by TestFlight or Ad Hoc Provisioning, I received a Not Registered error.p  blockquote   pmulticastid8921098464640731057,success0,failure1,canonicalids0,results[errorNotRegistered]p blockquote  pHow does it happen Any Solution  I have checked that I enabled APNS in both development and distribution provisioning profile.p  pI did not enable TLS on my server.

Negative 6018 pIve seen a lot of different implementations of this algorithm, but Im wondering if there are ways to improve the efficiency beyond just making the search binary.  Ive designed this particular version of the algorithm so the edges and midpoint of an arraylist will be checked immediately for the key being searched for, as to avoid looping through a search when the key your looking for is just the first, middle, or last element.  p  precodedef searchRBthearray, thekey, imin, imax     printsearching     found  False     if 0 gt thekey or thekey gt lenthearray         return found     else         imid  imin  imax  imin  2         if imid  thekey or imin  thekey or imax  thekey             found  True             return found         elif thearray[imid] gt thekey             return searchRBthearray, thekey, imin, imid1         elif thearray[imid] lt thekey             return searchRBthearray, thekey, imid1, imax         else             return found codepre  pFor example, if your were looking for the number 1 in a list of 1100, this would find it on the first loop, unlike some other implementations.p  pHowever, Im not sure if this actually improves efficiency at all except for certain edge cases, and if checking the first, mid, and end values in the listarray is actually detrimental once you continue to loop and have to check those three values every time.p  pIs this is good or bad implementation of this type of algorithm, or am I just splitting hairsp
