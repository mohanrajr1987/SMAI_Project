Positive 183 pI am using the Identity Server 3 Sample for Asp.Net Identity, which is working fine and I was also able to make it generate refresh tokens to renew the access tokens.p  pSo here is my question. One of the main points of having refresh tokens is that we can simulate token revocation, in a way that we store the refresh token in a database table, then every time the user wants to renew the access token using that refresh token, we first check if that refresh token exists in the database then let it renew the access token. So if we remove that DB record, the user wont be able to renew his token, hence token revoked.p  pNow in Identity Server 3, I can simply activate the refresh tokens for a client by adding codeUpdateAccessTokenClaimsOnRefresh  truecode to that client. But how do I store them in the DB and how do I make the token renewal process check the existence of that refresh token before accepting itp  pIs there a better way to do this What are the advantagesdisadvantagesp

Positive 183 pIm trying to call an Azure API App configured with Azure AD authentication. Assume for the purposes of this question I cannot use the Azure SDK and need to write code to get a token and insert it into the API request.p  pI have established that there are two modes  client flow and server flow, where client flow entails following at least one redirect to an issuer to get a token, and server flow where the server does this for you. Since Im talking about doing this in code, following redirects would be possible but fiddly, so Id prefer to use a mode where the URI or URIs to visit are known ahead of time and return content, rather than redirecting. The following diagram illustrates how the gateway routes all requests.p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comoB1qn.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comoB1qn.png altAPI app credential flowap  pI think the mode I need is client flow, which would go something likep  ul liGet an access token from the identity provider which is what how do I find out where this resides what is the format of the request I have to send to the IdPli liPass the access token to the gateway in what formatli liReceive another token in the gateway responseli liSupply this token in a header when making an API request which headerli ul  pHow am I supposed to do this The Azure documentation doesnt give enough detail about how it works, and expects all users to just use the SDK, which hides what is actually happening.p  pemThe actual reason is that ultimately this will need to be called from BizTalk, which uses the WCF WebHttpBinding to call restful services. Im writing a custom behaviour to insert a token header into the request, but I need to know how this token should be acquired. Its possible to run arbitrary code in BizTalk but trying to do this makes the solution complicated, and configonly or mostlyconfig with minimal, looselycoupled code is the simpler solutionemp

Positive 183 pI have a MVC project with 2 areas Admin and Client. I also have a login page in the main controller. What I want to do is to Authenticate a user based on its roles. If the user is for client they cant login to admin and the other way around.  For example if you try Localhostadmin, the code checks if the user is authorised. If not it redirects you to LocalhostadminAccountLogin. The same for Localhostclient to Localhostclientaccountlogin. I want to use a customAuthorize rather than [AuthorizeRolesAdmin]. p  peverything works fine if I dont use roles, but the problem is if you login as client you can simply change the url and go to admin.

Positive 183 pwe are implementing a Single Sign On process using WSO2 Identity Server. We have both Microsoft and Java web applications involved and we are facing a problem during the Single LogOut processing with Microsoft based web apps. The issue is related to session invalidation on Identity Provider initiated SLO.p  pThis is the scenariop  ul liWSO2 Identity Server with a single Identity Provider configuredli lian Asp.Net MVC application using ComponentSpace SAML2 assembly and Forms authentication marking controllers with the [Authorize] attribute to ensure that users are authenticated to access them.li lithe DEMO Java Web application provided by WSO2 to test SSOli ul  pThe login process works fine. We get a session ID from WSO2 and the user is authenticated landing on WSO2 login form in the first app, and transparently in the sencond one.p  pIn the Asp.Net webapp, when a successfull login occurs, we authenticate the user to access [Authorize] marked controllers calling FormsAuthentication.SetAuthCookieuserName, false . When the user logout from one of the apps, WSO2 sends a SLO request to other partecipants on a configured URI. When this request is reveived by the Microsoft one, we call the FormsAuthentication.SignOut method but the session is not destroyed. If the user refresh the browser page its User.Authenticated property is still True so he can still access [Authorize] marked controllers. This makes sense in my opinion because the caller is WSO2 and not the user browser.p  pWe performed some investigation in the code of the JAR provided by WSO2 for Java applications and it creates a filter on Tomcat implementing a singleton to store WSO2 Session ID relation with Session objects each time a success login operation occurs. When WSO2 request a SLO the filter gets WSO2 Session ID as parameter, accesses the singleton HashTable to retrieve the Session object and calls the Session.Invalidate method of the session object. If the user refreshes the browser, he gets redirected to login page. We tryied to implement something similar on Asp.Net side but even if we get the Session object on server side and call the Session.Abandon method nothing happens when the user refresh the browser. He is still marked as authenticated. p  pI am not very familiar with Cookies and I have the feeling that is something related to them.p  pHad anyone faced a similar issue  Any advice or suggestion will be very appreciated.p  pThanksp

Positive 183 pI have a set of public APIs that take in an id and some parameters.  Clients could be browsers or mobile phones, each having their own codeintcode ids, can interact with these public APIs.  Of course, we dont want a situation where client changes his id and send a request screwing things up for other people thus, when authentication takes place, a codeGUIDcode is sent to the client as an authentication token.  All subsequent request must include that authentication token.  On the server, the back end does a look up in the DB to match the codeGUIDcode with the id.  If they match, the process can go forward otherwise UnauthorizedAccessException is thrown.  All works fine and dandy.p  pBut of course, the problem is that every operation does a db look up.  I did some caching but then caching the authentication token has its own issues tears tears.  p  pOne other way to do it is to encrypt something and pass it in the query string.  But then when the request comes in, I have decrypt the string to see if its valid.  There is no free lunch there.p  pasp.net sets an encrypted cookie for authentication.  But the view state encrypts things in the hidden field.

I did some research and tests on my machine and picked the most reliable strongperfmonstrong countersp  precodeMemory.Pages Outputsec Memory.Available Bytes codepre  pI use thresholds and AND operator and it works quite well, but on the client machine also Windows XP both counters are useless. Available memory does not drop below 1GB and pages output is constant zero. After reading some logs I still dont see any useful counter. brCounters like committed memory give correct value, but the program runs out of memory with paging killing the performance after crossing 5060 of the 5GB available.p  pAny alternatives I wouldnt like to be forced to try to allocate memory and catch OutOfMemory exceptions during the computations.p

Negative 183 pstrongEDITstrong emSolution Foundem See my post below.p  pWe are writing a library that reads in a TIF file from a scanner. Basically, its a scantron. We are examining the form and reading values from it. p  pCurrently we have a windows test app, and we give it a filepath as a string ctestingimage.tif. It loads up the tif, reads the document correctly and parses the values.p  pWe also have an ASP.NET web application. We have a test page that does exactly what the windows app does, we hand it an identical string, and i calls the same function on the same class from the same library. It however does NOT read the form correctly. We have verified that it does it fact load up the tif file, and it is actually filled with data pixels we expect to be whiteblack are whiteblack when we examine the Bitmap obect in the immediate window of Visual Studio.p  pThe specific problem is in a library called strongDataMatrixstrong we use to scan a barcode off the document. This function is supposed to return a codeListltstringgt,code each of which is a barcode the library found on the document. In the windows app, this function DataMatrixDecoder.DecodeBarcodebitmap correctly returns with a Count1. When using the asp.net app, this returns with Count0. p  pBecause its the exact same image file, I cannot imagine the problem is in DataMatrix. I can only assume its something with ASP.NET or something. p  pThis isnt even my project, but another guy and I are helping our coworker figure this out, and we are just pulling our hair out. All signs indicate that ASP.NET is correctly loading and handing the image off disk to the processor class which is a class library that uses the DataMatrix stuff, we are not doing ANY code in ASP.NET except for openinghanding the file to the function..p  pDoes anyone have any ideas as to what it might be, or different things we can checkp  pIm not even sure what kind of information to give so I tried to say it all, if you have any questions please ask Id be more than happy to elaborate on anything. Thanks.p  pedit this is the code on the ascx.cs codebehind, in a buttonclick eventp  precodeif formReader.ReadTIFFctestingimage.tif      messages.Controls.AddHtmlHelper.DivSuccessRead successful.  codepre  pThe codeformReadercode class then open the file with a codeFileStreamcode, and uses that to create a codeBitmapcode. The ASP.NET application is not actually opening the file at all we were uploading it through a codeFormUploadcode control, but after experiencing problems we dummied it down to this. This is the most perplexing thing, that it works in the windows app but not from this web site. ASP.NET has full permissions on that folder to do whatever it wants. It can open the image fine, and the bitmap it creates from the FileStream is the actual image.p  pedit Also, the ReadTIFF function right now copies the FileStream into a MemoryStream, ensuring its a not a problem streaming from disk the entire file is in memory.p

I need to be able to convert a base Employee entity to a more specific entity e.g. TemporaryEmployee and from a more specific type back to the base type e.g. if an employee is no longer temporary then I want that instance to just be persisted as Employee. In the DB this is just a matter of adding or removing a row from the table for the specific subclass. Im using table per class. Im not seeing how to do this using EF calls though.p

It built an array of precalculated values which I could use in my code. It was a hack, but it worked.p  pBut there was a guy, who solved this problem with about 10 lines of code and it would give an answer in no time.

Negative 183 pIm creating a 2D tilebased RPG in XNA and am in the initial design phase. I was thinking of how I want my tile engine to work and came up with a rough sketch. Basically I want a grid of tiles, but at each tile location I want to be able to add more than one tile and have an offset. Id like this so that I could do something like add individual trees on the world map to give more flair. Or set bottles on a bar in some town without having to draw a bunch of different bar tiles with varying bottles.p  pBut maybe my reach is greater than my grasp. I went to implement the idea and had something like this in my Map objectp  precodeListltTilegt[,] Grid codepre  pBut then I thought about it. Lets say I had a world map of 200x200, which would actually be pretty small as far as RPGs go. That would amount to 40,000 Lists. To my mind I think there has to be a better way. Now this IS premature optimization. I dont know if the way I happen to design my maps and game will be able to handle this, but it seems needlessly inefficient and something that could creep up if my game gets more complex.p  pOne idea I have is to make the offset and the multiple tiles optional so that Im only paying for them when needed. But Im not sure how Id do this. A multiple array of objectsp  precodeobject[,] Grid codepre  pSo heres my criteriap  ul liA 2D grid of tile locationsli liEach tile location has a minimum of 1 tile, but can optionally have moreli liEach extra tile can optionally have an x and y offset for pinpoint placementli ul  pCan anyone help with some ideas for implementing such a design dont need it done for me, just ideas while keeping memory usage to a minimump  pIf you need more background heres roughly what my Map and Tile objects amount top  precodepublic struct Map      public Texture2D Texture     public ListltRectanglegt Sources Source Rectangles for where in Texture to get the sprite     public ListltTilegt[,] Grid  public struct Tile      public int Index Where in Sources to find the source Rectangle     public int X, Y Optional offsets  codepre

Negative 183 pIm trying to use code similar to a hrefhttpwww.debuginfo.comtoolsclrdump.html relnofollowclrdumpa to create mini dumps in my managed process. p  pThis managed process invokes CCLI code which invokes some native C static lib code, wherein SEH exceptions may be thrown e.g. the occasional access violation.p  precode  C WinForms   gt      CCLI DLL     gt       Static C Lib       gt         ACCESS VIOLATION codepre  pOur policy is to produce mini dumps for all SEH exceptions caught amp uncaught and then translate them to C exceptions to be handled by application code. This works strongfor purely nativestrong processes just fine but when the application is a C application  not so much.p  pThe only way I see to produce dumps from SEH exceptions in a C process is to strongnotstrong catch them  and then, as unhandled exceptions, use the codeApplication.ThreadExceptioncode handler to create a mini dump. The alternative is to let the CLR translate the SEH exception into a .Net exception and catch it e.g. codeSystem.AccessViolationExceptioncode  but that would mean no dump is created, and information is lost stack trace information in codeExceptioncode isnt as rich as the mini dump.p  pSo how can I handle SEH exceptions by both creating a minidump strongandstrong translating the exception into a .Net exception so that my application may try to recoverp  pstrongEditstrongp  pBy not catching exceptions I also mean catching and then rethrowing, which does preserve the rich exception information.p  pRight now Im considering never supressing codeSystem.Exceptioncode or anything deriving from codeSystem.SystemExceptioncode. This means codeAccessViolationcode and friends always cause the program to end and produce a dump, and all other exceptions thrown need to derive from some subtype codeApplicationExceptioncode.p

Negative 183 pSo I am querying some extremely large tables.  The reason they are so large is because PeopleSoft inserts new records every time a change is made to some data, rather than updating existing records.  In effect, its transactional tables are also a data warehouse.p  pThis necessitates queries that have nested selects in them, to get the most recentcurrent row.  They are both effective dated and within each date cast to a day they can have an effective sequence.  Thus, in order to get the current record for codeuserid123code, I have to do thisp  precodeselect  from sometable st where st.userid  123 and st.effectivedate  select maxsti.effectivedate    from sometable sti where sti.userid  st.userid and st.effectivesequence  select maxsti.effectivesequence    from sometable sti where sti.userid  st.userid   and sti.effectivedate  st.effectivedate codepre  pThere are a phenomenal number of indexes on these tables, and I cant find anything else that would speed up my queries.p  pMy trouble is that I often times want to get data about an individual from these tables for maybe 50 userids, but when I join my tables having only a few records in them with a few of these PeopleSoft tables, things just go to crap.p  pThe PeopleSoft tables are on a remote database that I access through a database link.  My queries tend to look like thisp  precodeselect st. from localtable lt, sometableremotedb st where lt.userid in 123, 456, 789 and lt.userid  st.userid and st.effectivedate  select maxsti.effectivedate    from sometableremotedb sti where sti.userid  st.userid and st.effectivesequence  select maxsti.effectivesequence    from sometableremotedb sti where sti.userid  st.userid   and sti.effectivedate  st.effectivedate codepre  pThings get even worse when I have to join several PeopleSoft tables with my local table.  Performance is just unacceptable.p  pWhat are some things I can do to improve performance  Ive tried query hints to ensure that my local table is joined to its partner in PeopleSoft first, so it doesnt attempt to join all its tables together before narrowing it down to the correct userid.  Ive tried the codeLEADINGcode hint and toyed around with hints that tried to push the processing to the remote database, but the explain plan was obscured and just said REMOTE for several of the operations and I had no idea what was going on.p  pAssuming I dont have the power to change PeopleSoft and the location of my tables, are hints my best choice  If I was joining a local table with four remote tables, and the local table joined with two of them, how would I format the hint so that my local table which is very small  in fact, I can just do an inline view to have my local table only be the userids Im interested in is joined first with each of the remote onesp  pstrongEDITstrong The application needs realtime data so unfortunately a materialized view or other method of caching data will not suffice.p

Because its a big website which need 100 safe photo upload script.p  pstrongEditstrong or maybe I should allow members to upload pics to receptacles like imageshack and copy their link to my website I guess it is 100 safe, rightp
Negative 183 pFirst off, that is not a typo, I want to emdecryptem using a empublicem key.  The purpose for doing this is to challenge a third party to ensure they do, in fact, have the private key that corresponds to the public key.  Basically, I would send some random data, they would encrypt it with their private key, I would decrypt it using the public key and compare the decrypted value to the random data that I sent.  I believe this is a pretty standard procedure in public key crypto but for some reason decrypting with a public key seems to be taboo.p  pI am simply using the codeRSACryptoServiceProvidercode in .NET 2.0.  However, when I call codeDecryptcode it throws a codeCryptographicExceptioncode with message codeBad Keycode.  The key is not bad I can codeEncryptcode with no problem, but it appears as though it will not let me decrypt with just the public key.  What gives  This must be possible to do.p
Negative 183 pI have a single textField in the cell allocation section and after this section I try to provide give the text field various arguments. Works fine no problem till here, the problem lies how to handle which textField is returning in the delegate method.   p  pMy Earlier approach was to simply allocate different text fields for different user input, simple but produces UI glitch when there are many textFields, hence want avoid it. p  pfor better understanding here is sample code for table delegate method cellAtIndexRow p  precode Customize the appearance of table view cells.

Negative 183 pIm looking at a way to have a subversion repository to be basically a copy of another subversion repository, except a few files from the other repository that I want to override.p  pBasically, I would want to achieve something like thisp  precode  branches    mybranch  if files are added in trunk, they get added here      file1  latest rev of trunkfile1      file2  latest rev of trunkfile2      file3  unique, versioned file that belongs to mybranch only      dir1  if files are added in trunkdir1, they get added here        file4  latest rev of trunkdir1file4        file5  unique, versioned file that belongs to mybranch only  trunk    file1    file2    file3    dir1      file4      file5 codepre  pThis is all on the same repo, but this shouldnt be relevant The final objective being that when someone checks out codemybranchcode, they get all the code codetrunkcode  the differences that codemybranchcode contains, not just the code specific to codemybranchcode. The most attractive solution would be to use codesvnexternalscode, but would it work on directories That is, if a file called codefile6code is added to trunk, would it be added to codemybranchcode automatically toop  pIf a branch isnt the correct approach, what would be Im not asking for the correct way to use a branch, Im asking for the correct way to get what I described, whether it involves a branch or not.p
Negative 183 pI have a CQt QThread worker thread, which stores its current status as an ENUM e.g. values such as Working, Finished.

Negative 183 pThere are a lot of different classes that can be used in various ways to readwrite to files in Android. For example, you can make use of java.nio.ByteBuffer, FileOutputStream and BufferedOutputStream. Are there any general guidelines for what to use to readwrite quickly to the SD card For example, BufferedOutputStream seems as if it should make things faster but Im unsure the buffer size should be set for.p  pSpecifically, I want to readwrite byte arrays that are 1Mb in size as quickly as I can. p

Negative 183 pI have a decent sized chunk of .NET code that now needs to be accessed by an ASP web page. Transactions need to be sent at regular instances to this server for processing. Processing takes less than a second and there are maybe 1001000 such transactions a dayp  pIve really only worked with COM and windows services before, so my normal approach would be to have a windows service will all the necessary data in memory running and a client GUI would connect and send the request and receive the answer.p  pFrom what I can make out about ASP is that a DLL or a web service is the way to access the server nowadays. p  pMy issue with the DLL is, is that the DLL would have to load information out of a database to build up the latest information before a transaction could be checked.

Perhaps that is part of my issue. Also, I need the headers of the columns to disappear.p  pThanks for any tips.p  pEDIT I am making them invisible in my button click command. I am not using generated columns, so I think that is set to false. I got a bit fed up with this issue and left work, and wont be back till mid next week, so I might have to hold off finding the solution till then. Thanks for the comments everyone, I will look it over soon. Sorry, I cant give more feedback in a timely fashion.p  pEdit x2 Do have I have to handle it in some sort of postback or somethingp

Negative 183 pI am running a daemon which analyses files in a directory and then deletes them. In case the daemon is not running for whatever reason, files get stacked there. Today I had 90k files in that directory. After starting the daemon again, it processed all the files.p  pHowever, the directory remains large ls dh . returns a size of 5.6M. How can I defragment that directory I already figured out that renaming that directory, and creaing a new one with the same name and permissions solves the problem. However, as files get written in there at any time, there doesnt seem to be a safe way to rename the directory and create a new one as for a moment, the target directory does not exist.p  pSo a is there a waya shell program which can defragment directories on an ext3 filesystem or b is there a way to create a lock on a directory so that trying to write files blocks until the renamecreate has finishedp

Negative 183 pI am writing a VXML application which accepts an incoming SIP voice call and then polls a web service on a Java application running on a Tomcat instance on the same host machine for incoming voice requests eg. play an audio prompt or collect some digits from a separate channel. These voice requests are received via a separate WS interface and cached for the VXML sessions to collect. The voice requests may be received anywhere from 0.5s to 30 seconds after the call is accepted. p  pLogically, the VXML sessions should poll periodically for new requests and the Java application in Tomcat return a nonblocking response indicating if any requests have been received. However an additional constraint I have is that the CPU cost of making a web service call from the VXML interpreter is quite high, so repeating this regularly for large volumes of simultaneous calls will noticably impact system capacity.p  pA preferred approach would be to have the web application block the polls from the VXML application until a voice service request arrives in the cache with a timeout of eg. 5 or 10s. However, I understand using Thread.sleep on servlet threads for long periods of time is a bad idea at the best of times, so Im looking for an alternative to achieving this.p  pThis application needs to support large volumes of simultaneous sessions on the server expecting up to 1000 VXML sessions on planned hardware, so just increasing the thread count on Tomcat would not be acceptable.p  pIs there a way I can have Tomcat sideline the request for a period of time while freeing up the servlet thread for other requests Per chance, is Tomcat smart enough to do this simply when I use Thread.sleep p  pThanks, fbp

Negative 183 pBecause I need a free and reliable XML editor, I just installed the Netbeans 7.0  JDK bundle from Oracle.com. I will not be using Java nor will I be learning it at this point. I am learning XML and need to work with it for a project. I will send the XML docs to someone else who will include it in their program. Product Version NetBeans IDE 7.0 Java 1.6.026 Java HotSpotTM Client VM 20.1b02 Not knowing Java, I finally found a way to get an XML editor up on IDE, but am not sure if I selected the correct type of Java project to access the XML editor, and am not sure where to specify to store the docs, etc. That is, when it says to select a new project so that I can open an XML editor, I selected Java Application. But I do not know the significance of this. Does it matter if I select Java Desktop Application, Java Class Library, Java Project with Existing Sources, or Java freeform project for the new project if I will be creating several XML docs for one project Also, it later asks me if I want to store the XML doc that I just opened and created in the src or elsewhere. Does this matter where I store the XML docs that I will create I could not find much information on the net about using the XML editor with Netbeans except for one older tutorial that assumed one knew Java.

Negative 183 pI am making a forum and I want it to run like a desktop application, so I do not refresh the page. For lack of a better method without another complete Ajax request I receive the number of pages of data available in an Ajax request. I need to display this data as I have at ethoma.comtesthome.php  I set the page size to 1 for testing but I also need to add event handlers to each individual number displayed to trigger an event that will change the color of the text and trigger an Ajax call to get the page number specified. The challenge for me is that there could be 500 pages of course then I wouldnt be able to display every page number.

Negative 183 pI am attempting to reuse codeImageViewcode objects in a codeRelativeLayoutcode to avoid the cost of memory allocation. Specifically I create an codeImageViewcode programatically, and associate a fade animatiom with it. The animation runs and in codeonAnimationEndcode I set visibility to codeGONEcode and push the codeImageViewcode on a queue. When I next want to repeat this process I look to see if there is an codeImageViewcode on the queue and if so use this instead of requesting a new one. There is quite a delay between these uses so the animation is definitely done and dusted. The problem is that whilst the reused view will accept new codeImageResourcecode, I cannot get it to accept new codeRelativeLayout.LayoutParamscode to set the view to a different position in the layout Any help much appreciatedp

Negative 183 pIm building a siteapp which will be displayed in an iframe. I have done it loads of times before, and it has caused me loads of problems in the past... The main problem is crossdomain cookies being blocked.p  pI know it is  a matter of using the same root domain name and setting document.domain. But considering the lovely new EU cookie legislation omg they are lame and the general direction browsers are heading with respect to privacy and security, using sessioncookies in iframes will probably become more and more troublesome. So in order to futureproof the site a little, I would prefer to implement it without using cookies at all.p  pThe implementation I have so far simply sets a query string value, which is passed on to all pages. I guess this is kind of the same as ASP.NETs cookieless session feature. However this has the implication that if someone uses a public computer, another person using it a moment later can find their URL including session ID and continue their session. Since this site deals with sensitive data that is not acceptable. The ASP.NET cookieless feature suffers from the same loophole which makes me a bit pessimistic about finding a solution.p  pIm developing in .NET but this must be a generic issue for all environments.p  pstrongShort versionstrongp  pDoes anyone know how to maintain session state in a cookieless site running inside an iframe perhaps some best practices as well. It is imperative that when the user closes his browser the session must be effectively killed, so no info is disclosed by the browser history list  just as it would with a normal sessioncookie.p  pstrongPossible solutionstrongp  pIm considering something along these lines. But it is far from optimal.p  ol liThe page continouesly makes a keepalive ajaxrequest to the serverli liThe server updates a timestamp with last keepalive invocation for the ID stored in the query stringli liIf the keepalive timestamp gets more than say 10 seconds old, the data related to the ID is killed, and the user will receive a session timed out  please start over message if they revisit the URL with the now dead ID.li ol

Negative 183 pI succesfully implemented a Delaunay triangulation of a contour in OpenCV 2.3.1. p  pWith cvPointPolygonTest I can get all the triangles in the convex hull, then I tried to perform another cvPointPolygonTest on triangles centroid to know if they are strongin the main contour or notstrong, so I can have the constrained triangulation of the contour. p  pBut, it doesnt work well, as some triangles are eg. with a walking man who has his two legs distant strongover a holestrong. p  pDoes anyone know a way to perform a constrained triangulation.

Negative 183 pI am creating an application where each tab has different screens to switch between. Originally I was going to have each tab show a different activity but from what I have read, it seems that is a bad way of doing it.p  pSo I have been using an xml file which has the layout for each screen all in the one file. And I use Java to program which to display each screen required and hide the ones I dont need.

My activity has many screens and its getting an eye sore scrolling through all this code at once, as the more screens I add, the larger the code is getting.p  pIdeally I would like to have the code for each screen in its own Java class, and the layouts for each screen in their own xml files and just switch between these. p  pTo give you example of my codep  precodeltTabHost androidididtabhost androidlayoutwidthfillparent androidwindowSoftInputModeadjustResize xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid androidbackground92c223 androidlayoutheightfillparentgt  ltLinearLayout androidididtab1 androidlayoutaboveandroididtabs    androidlayoutwidthfillparent         androidlayoutheightwrapcontentgt         ltScrollView androidlayoutwidthfillparent             androidlayoutheightwrapcontentgt             ltRelativeLayout androidlayoutwidthmatchparent                 androidlayoutheightwrapcontentgt XML CODE FOR LAYOUT GOES IN HERE.

Negative 183 pSo, I currently hold an instance of the ResourceManager in a static variable accessible for all classes in my solution. Ive used it for getting translation stuff for singlethreaded operation and it was working just fine and dandy. p  pHowever, I then added an operation that takes a bit longer to execute, and I need to update the progress in the UI. For the progress information strings, I also use the ResourceManager. Thing is, the same exact line of code returns null Localization.ResourceManager.GetStringProgressInformation1, for example if it is executed on a separate thread. But if I dont fire a new thread for it, it returns the string as expected. I checked the MSDN library, and according to it, ResourceManager should be threadsafe and all. So what am I doing wrongp

Negative 183 pI am using a BlockingCollection to process some files and then upload them to a server.p  pRight now I have a single Producer that recurses the file system and compresses certain files to a temporary location.  Once it has finished with a file it adds my own object to the BlockingCollection that contain information, such as, File Name, File Path, Modified date, etc.  The Consumer then grabs this object and uses it to upload the file.  When the Producer has finished searching the file system and working on files it calls the BlockingCollection.CompleteAdding method to signal the Consumer that it has finished.p  pWhat I would like to do is increase the number of Producers to 2 or more.  The reason being that the compression process takes a while and on multi core processors Im only taking advantage of 1 core.  This causes the Producer to sometimes fall behind the Consumer on faster networks.p  pMy question is, when I have multiple Producers and only one Consumer how can I signal the Consumer that all of the Producers have finished their work  If I call the BlockingCollection.CompleteAdding method on one of the Producers I could still have one or more other producers still working.p

Negative 183 pI have simple codeObjectListViewcode which displays some columns from codeEntityFrameworkcode of objects called codePersoncode to simplify things. I load it with Entity Framework to codeObjectListviewcodeand then codedeatchcode it from Context. The person has multiple fields like Name, Surname, File, .... p  pConsidering that some files are 5mb50mb I dont want to loadsave them to database without need. Now when someone double clicks in codeObjectListViewcode the selected codePersoncode is loaded into TextBox fields.  When editing any of the fields I check if codePersoncode Name or SurName changed and if it did I updated the context like in the code below.p  precode    private void test Person person         using var context  new EntityBazaCRMSettings.sqlDataConnectionDetailsCRM              context.Persons.Attachdokument             if person.Name  nameTextBox.Text                  person.Name  nameTextBox.Text                 context.ObjectStateManager.GetObjectStateEntryperson.SetModifiedPropertyName                          if person.SurName  surNameTextBox.Text                  person.SurName  surNameTextBox.Text                 context.ObjectStateManager.GetObjectStateEntryperson.SetModifiedPropertySurName                          context.SaveChanges                codepre  pThis works.. but what I would like to do is actually not save the changes straight away after users changes it but in the end when he presses BIG button codeSAVE ALLcode so then it would go thru all ObjectListView items and update them as needed in database. The problem is I cant update context and do it later since the Context wouldnt be used then but in the end when saving everything.  p  pSo what are my options I was pointed to use a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9104553howtofindoutifanentityframeworkobjecthaschangedINotifyPropertyChangeda but as much as I looked at the code I dont think its good for this type of situation or I simply dont know how to use it.p  pThe other option was to actually create bool value per each codeColumncode from the database likep  precodepublic partial class Person      public bool NameChanged getset       public bool SurnameChanged  get set   codepre  pAnd when saving I would be checking if bool changed and if yes do the ObjectStateManager magic on the context prior to save. p  pAny other way to do this p
Negative 183 pI am building a system that is a central repository for storing data from a number of other systems. A sync process is required to update the central repository when the other systems data is updated.

Negative 183 pQuite a broad question. Im looking to refactor an existing game app so that we have a base framework for games, which are extended with some kind of modular plugin architecture. So we havep  pGameCore  lots of base classes, etc. GameBundle ABC...  bundles with lots of subclasses of those in the core, along with lots of resourcesp  pThe game wont function at all without a concrete bundle which implements the game itself. In theory it would also be possible to break down these bundles further and mix and match. This is a very appealing design.p  pUsing NSBundle seems to be the neatest solution, but Im hitting some snags The code in the GameBundle must be linked with the GameCore or it wont compile, but then when the GameCore code is loaded from the NSBundle, you get duplicates of all the core classes. This suggests that Im way off the mark with how Im approaching thisp  pThis could easily be implemented with static libs, but then its not possible to easily include resources...p  pSo, could anyone suggest a workable architecture that would do as I wish To summarisep  pAbstract game core Indeterminate number of GameBundles added to the target, which are ideally loaded dynamically at runtime.p  pHope someone can helpp

I found some info on another forum which sheds a little more light but still doesnt provide an answer... It looks like the file size makes no difference. Downloading a small file but sleeping the thread in the loop to extend the download time has the same effect. It seems that any operation longer than x amount of time the other post reckons 100s will reach the end and immediately time out. Also I noted when stepping through with the debugger that the total received bytes is equal to the file size so it is exactly as it tries to read the last of the file only to find there is none left except it never finds out because the server never tells it END EDITp  pThe ftp server is suppose to respons with 226  Closing data connection. Requested file action successful for example, file transfer or file abort.p  pHowever when I used wireshark I can see that this is not coming in with [TCP Retransmission] in front of it. Not sure yet what this is... still googling. But Im sure it has relevance.p  pSo it looks like something is timing out or being closed early but being new to both FTP and somewhat to .net I am not sure where to proceed from here.p  pI have tried many different thingsp  ul liKeepalive  falseli liSetPointManager.MaxIdleTimeli liIncreasing server timeoutli ul  pIt seems like it is the server kicking me off but it works fine with filezilla so there must be some way to avoid this.p  pEDIT 20042012 It does not work fine with filezilla or explorer I tried downloading from ftp using explorer and received a message that the operation had timed out. Filezilla downloads the file then times out but it cleverly tries again with a REST command. I suspect implementing this could be the ideal soulution so I am off to figure that out. Will post as answer if I succeed. END EDITp  pOne point to note is that until the WebException is passed access to the downloaded file is blocked. So in the case of WebClient which I cant affect timeouts it will just hang at 100 for a long time. and then throw the exception. If I set the FtpRequest timeout to 1000 and handle the exception the file appears to have downloaded completely and I am able to extract it without any corruption.p  pIf anyone has any tips or pointers, or even better a solution  I would be very grateful. All input will be accepted.p  pThank youp  pP.S I tried to provide as much info as possible but if you need more let me know.p

When presented modally this is not the case so to duplicate the interface a toolbar needs to be created separately and closesave buttons added to this instead.p  pWhen dismissing a pushed view we send a message to the navigation controller code[self.navigationController popViewControllerAnimatedYES]code, when dismissing a modal view we send a message to self code[self dismissModalViewControllerAnimatedYES]codep

Negative 183 pI am looking to create a system for tracking versions history of content of ndb.ModelsExpandos on Google App Engine Python.p  pThe content can be relatively lengthy and there may be many versions, but diffs between versions may be quite small. I expect others have done something like this and I would like to know how they went about it and what principles may guide the design amp development.p  pIt is not known at the time of deployment what the attributes of the data models would be e.g. title, content, body, dated, etc., but the types are known dates, text, etc.p  pMy initial thought is to have the arranged something like thisp  precodefrom google.appengine.ext import ndb  class Versionndb.Expando   versionid  ndb.IntegerProperty    dated, etc.    data properties are not known in advance, hence Expando   class MyDocndb.Model    head      ndb.KeyPropertykindVersion     instance  ndb.kindPropertykindVersion, repeatedTrue      may be a StructuredProperty codepre  pThe overview of the algorithms isp  h3Savingh3  pEvery time a user saves a document, put all the latest data into a new codeVersioncode and point codeheadcode to that instance.p  pAt that point, or some time after, go through old versions and change full saves to diffs to save on space with e.g. a hrefhttpcode.google.compgooglediffmatchpatch relnofollowdiffmatchpatcha. I would expect one full save per hour, day or some set time  or some set number of diffs.p  h3Loadingh3  pLoading codeheadcode is trivial.p  pOlder versions would be marked as a full save or a diff, and depending on which the data may be returned directly or compiled from the diff.p  h3Thoughtsh3  pI am sure others have tackled this problem, and I would love to know what ideas and implementations are out there about it. Obviously, there are full version control systems such as Git, Mercurial and Subversion and CVS  but those are both overkill for the intended purpose and would not work on Google App Engine.p
Negative 183 pI have a windows app which has MySQL backend. I have codewampservercode installed on my machine which bundles a certain version of codephpmyadmincode along with MySQL version 5.0.51a. But in client machines they have MySQL version 5.1. In short development is on 5.0, while deployment is on 5.1. This is creating a bit of issues for us, since those two versions behave slightly different. So I got a standalone setup of vesion 5.1 and installed on my development machine.p  pNow when I run my app, it needs either wamp services version 5.0 turned on, or it needs MySQL 5.1 standalone installation installed in Program FilesMySQL... Both ways work. p  pQuestion1 Am I right to assume my app is relying on MySQL 5.0 if only wamp service is turned on and on MySQL 5.1 if only original MySQL service is turned on Yes I suppose.p  pQuestion2 main question The app works if I have both services turned on aswell.

Negative 183 pWith 32 bit floats I think there is something like 231  1 representable floats. In java you can take an existing float and find the next float using the Math library. But lets say you dont have a starting float, is there a way to compute the nth float I dont care what language, if there is a language with a library function Ill take it.p  pOf course I could simply put all the floats in an array and index into that, but that is space inefficient.p  pHere is some further clarification. I could start at Float.MIN and increment N times using nextFloat, but this seems inefficient because I need to perform this operation many times.p

Negative 183 pIve created an ON DELETE rule on a view that SELECTs OLD into a temporary table and then calls a function that performs actions using the values of OLD. The rule deletes the temporary table before running the SELECT INTO TEMPORARY TABLE in case the rule is called more than once during a session by performing a SELECT dropTempTable.

Negative 183 pIve been trying to find out a standard compliant way of handling multipartmixed contents as a stream using JAXRS. By default if Ive not mistaken multipart fragments are stored in memory or as temporary files before the container passes the request to the service. p  pThe reason why I prefer direct streaming over streaming from temporary files is that each part of the multipartmixed request contains a file, that must be persisted reliable storage  clustered database in a single transaction. Because there should be no size limit for the files that are transmitted over the system, and both the client and the server are located in local network, storing gigabytes of data in temporary files on SAN will cause a significant performance hit.p  pIs there a way to stream parts directly to the database using JAXRS If not should I implement the service as a servlet or split the transaction to multiple requests and use JAXRS Implementing the service as a servlet would require a streaming multipartmixed compliant parser while splitting the transaction wouldnt be a trivial task either.p

Negative 183 pI have a table say, MyTable created using CF. Also, theres asps Membership table in my DB, which was auto generated along with Users, UserInRoles and Roles tables. These table exist only in the DB, and not as a model class in the project. Now, I need to set a foreign key in MyTable to Membership table. The problem is, of course, that there is no Membership class in my project so I cant set that FK with code first. Id like to keep my users management in the trustful hands of asp.net, so I dont want to create my own tables for this. p  pHow can I set that FK using code first p

Negative 183 pIm fairly new to neo4j. Ive played a little bit with cypher and REST API. I want to be able to create a leaf node along certain path, consider these nodes are some types of events. I wouldnt know during run time the id of the node this event will be attached to. I need to either do a lookup and then get the id of the node and then create my new node. p  pSo during run time I was hoping I can do a MATCH using cypher to get the node to which I can attach the event and CREATE new node along with the relationship to the existing node returned by MATCH. So I came across the cypher cheat sheet which has a readwritereturn query which I thought would be good fit. But there is nothing much mentioned about it in documentation or may be Im not a super googler p  pCould someone please tell me if thisreadwritereturn is the rightvalid approach p  pMany Thanksp

Negative 183 pI have been over this issue for the last year or so, changing what I am doing and trying different things. The issue is to do with the schema so I can still order nicely in playerclan ladders but if we want to add a stat later it wont lock our table changing every row due to one stat per column. p  pI see two options for how to do this but both dont seem to be right. One is one stat per column. There would be 4 tables, userstatsummary for basic stats shown on ladders, userstatbeast teams are human vs beast, userstathuman and userstatoverall. Stats are shown everywhere from the last 30 days. A cron job will take any dated stats by getting a query on matches that happened after the 30 days and taking away those stats from the 3 main tables and putting them into the overall one. Matches will have blobs for the stats each player got for that match. The issue I see here is when we have a lot of rows that we cant easily add more stats when say the game changes a little. What I was thinking was a extrastats blob column on each table and if we add new stats they simply arent going to be sortable on the ladders. p  pThe other option is an EAV model which is what I have been playing around with but cant seem to get it right. I would be getting many more rows per query and then grouping them into users and the order would work for the most part but I couldnt get limits right for pagination since there was generally an unknown number of rows selected. p  pWhat I was thinking is the EAV model with a table that stores ranks per stats which could be used for ordering. So the EAV tables are currently as follows...p  precodeCREATE TABLE userstat      userid int10 unsigned NOT NULL,     statid varchar50 NOT NULL,     value int10 unsigned NOT NULL,     PRIMARY KEY userid,statid,     CONSTRAINT user FOREIGN KEY userid REFERENCES xfuser userid  ENGINEInnoDB DEFAULT CHARSETutf8  CREATE TABLE userhumanstat       userid int10 unsigned NOT NULL,      statid varchar50 NOT NULL,      value int10 unsigned NOT NULL,      PRIMARY KEY userid,statid,      CONSTRAINT humanuser FOREIGN KEY userid REFERENCES xfuser userid  ENGINEInnoDB DEFAULT CHARSETutf8  CREATE TABLE userbeaststat       userid int10 unsigned NOT NULL,      statid varchar50 NOT NULL,      value int10 unsigned NOT NULL,      PRIMARY KEY userid,statid,      CONSTRAINT beastuser FOREIGN KEY userid REFERENCES xfuser userid  ENGINEInnoDB DEFAULT CHARSETutf8  CREATE TABLE userstatoverall       userid int10 unsigned NOT NULL,      human blob NOT NULL,      beast blob NOT NULL,      total blob NOT NULL,      PRIMARY KEY userid,      CONSTRAINT useroverall FOREIGN KEY userid REFERENCES xfuser userid  ENGINEInnoDB DEFAULT CHARSETutf8 codepre  pSo I was thinking I could add a userstatrank table which would be userid, statid, rank. Then say I want to get the first page of the ladder ordered by the kills stat I could get all the userids order by rank where statid is kills. Then make a second query to populate all the users stats. p  pAfter writing all this out it seems like it would work fine but I might not be seeing something. I also understand this question is all over the place so if you would like me to edit in details at places just say so.p

Negative 183 pWhen using methods which return blocks they can be very convenient.  However, when you have to string a few of them together it gets messy really quicklyp  pfor instance, you have to call 4 URLs in successionp  precode[remoteAPIWithURLurl1 successint status     [remoteAPIWithURLurl2 successint status         [remoteAPIWithURLurl3 successint status             [remoteAPIWithURLurl2 successint status             succes             ]         ]     ] ] codepre  pSo for every iteration I go one level deeper, and I dont even handle errors in the nested blocks yet.p  pIt gets worse when there is an actual loop. For instance, say I want to upload a file in 100 chunksp  precode void continueUploadWithBlockNrintblockNr      ifblocknrgt100           success          [remoteAPIUploadFilefile withBlockNrblockNr successint status              [self continueUploadWithBlockNrblockNr]     ]  codepre  pThis feels very unintuitive, and gets very unreadable very quick.p  pIn .Net they solved all this using the async and await keyword, basically unrolling these continuations into a seemingly synchronous flow.p  pWhat is the best practice in Objective Cp
Negative 183 pI have a doubt regarding the correct usage of NSRunLoops coderunModebeforeDatecode method.p  pI have a secondary, background thread that processes delegate messages as they are received.p  pBasically, I have process intensive logic that needs to be executed on a background thread.p  pSo, I have 2 objects, codeObjectAcode and codeAnotherObjectBcode. p  pcodeObjectAcode initializes codeAnotherObjectBcode and tells codeAnotherObjectBcode to start doing its thing. codeAnotherObjectBcode works asynchronously, so codeObjectAcode acts as codeAnotherObjectBcodes delegate. Now, the code that needs to be executed in the delegate messages, needs to be done on a background thread. So, for codeObjectAcode, I created an NSRunLoop, and have done something like this to set the run loop upp  precodedo   [[NSRunLoop currentRunLoop] runModeNSDefaultRunLoopMode beforeDate[NSDate distantFuture]]  while aCondition codepre  pWhere codeaConditioncode is set somewhere in the completion delegate message.p  pIm getting all my delegate messages and they are being processed on that background thread.p  pstrongMy question being is this the correct approachstrongp  pThe reason I ask this is because code[NSDate distantFuture]code is a date spanning a couple of centuries. So basically, the runLoop wont timeout until distantFuture  I definitely wont be using my Mac or this version of iOS till then. ltp  pHowever, I dont want the run loop to run that long. I want the run loop to get done as soon as my last delegate message is called, so that it can properly exit.p  pAlso, I know that I can set repeating timers, with shorter intervals, but that is not the most efficient way since its akin to polling. Instead, I want the thread to work only when the delegate messages arrive, and sleep when there are no messages. So, is the approach Im taking the correct approach, or is there some other way of doing it. I read the docs and the guide, and I set this up based off what I understood from reading them.p  pHowever, when not completely sure, best to ask this awesome community for an opinion and confirmation.p  pSo, thanks in advance for all your helpp  pCheersp

Negative 183 pI have a wordpress network running on a shared host to great satisfaction apart from a security dilemma.p  pWhen I first installed the application, I did this through a plesk Cpanel. And later when I started to add plugins I realised the server used safemode On. I asked the host to remove it and they did but before this I did install most of my plugins through FTP because of permission problems due to the safemode On setting.p  pBut now I seem to be running into a different setting that is limiting me. Because I installed plugins through FTP, my FTP user is the owner of the files. Now when I try to update through the normal wordpress routine, it doesnt have sufficient permission for the stream folder and when I set this to 777 it has not enough permission for the plugin folders because apache is not the owner of the folders and files.p  pI do not want to set all my folders to 777 775 also doesnt work, changing owner I tested with creating a folder through a Wordpress plugin works, but a hrefhttpcodex.wordpress.orgChangingFilePermissions relnofollowhttpcodex.wordpress.orgChangingFilePermissionsa tells me I shouldnt let apache be the owner of my files and folders.p  pCould you advise me aboutp  ul lisecurity issues with regards to letting apache be the owner of my files and foldersli lisecurity issues with regards to 777 permissions I think this is obvious a security risk, but perhaps Im overlooking somethingli liare there other things I could do to make wordpress function normallyli ul  pIf you need more information about the shared hosting, please let me know.p

Negative 183 pThis probably is a bit complicated but is there anyway or already a script out there that could show you all foreign key constraints tied to a single table row.p  pWhat I mean by this is say you have the following DB structurep  precodeTABLE 1 column a column b  TABLE 2 column c column d foreign key constraint to 1.a  TABLE 3 column e  column f foreign key constraint to 2.c  TABLE 4 column g foreign key constraint to 3.e column h codepre  pThen, you have 2 rows in Table 1. One of the rows is constrained through table 2, then further to table 3, BUT not further to table 4 IDs tied throughout tables 13.p  pI would like to simply query one of the rows in Table 1 and have it tell me that for that row there are ties that go to Table 2, and then those rows have ties to Table 3. Using this query on the second row in Table 1 would simply just return nothing as there are no foreign keys that are tying that row down.p  pSomething like this would be immensely useful when it comes to tracking down what tablesrows are currently using a particular starting row.p  pThanksp

Negative 183 pDoes the WaveOut API has some internal limitation of the size for the current piece of buffer played  I mean if I provide a very small buffer does it affects somehow the sound played to the speakers. I am experiencing very strange noise when I am generating and playing the sinus wave with small buffer. Something like a peak, or BUMP.p  h1The complete Storyh1  pI made a program that can generate Sinus sound signal in real time. The variable parameters are Frequency and  Volume. The project requirement was to have a maximum latency of 50 ms. So the program must be able to produce Sinus signals with manually adjustable frequency of audio signal in real time.p  pI used Windows WaveOut API, C and Pinvoke to access the API.p  pEverything works fine when the sound buffer is 1000 ms large. If I minimize the buffer to 50 ms as per latency requirement then for certain frequencies I am experiencing at the end of every buffer, a noise or BUMP. I do not understand if the sound generated is malformed  I checked and is not or something happens with the Audio chip, or some delay in initializing and playing.p  pWhen I save the produced audio to .wav file everything is perfect.p  pThis means the must be some bug in my code or the audio subsystem has a limitation to the buffer chunks sent to it.p  pFor those who doesnt know WaveOut must be initialized at first time and then must be prepared with audio headers for each buffer that are containing the number of bytes that needs to be played and the pointer to a memory that contains the audio that needs to be player.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pNoise happens with the following combinations 44100 SamplingRate, 16 Bits, 2 channels, 50 ms buffer and generated Sinus audio signal of 201Hz, 202Hz, 203Hz, 204Hz, 205Hz ... 219Hz,  220Hz, 240 Hz, is okp  pWhy is this difference of 20, I do not know.p

So maybe Im posing my question in a way that is unanswerable.  Let me try adding some context.p  pMy app is assembling data from multiple Twitter API calls of different types as specified by Twitter.  Im not building tables for display.  I just want the data in ivars and eventually managed objects.  The app has a lot to do other than just get the Twitter data, so I dont want to put too much of the structure of my app inside a single performRequestWithHandler block just so I can access its returned data at some point. To me, getting the data from the net is a utility operation, not the sole app design determinant.  Some of my API calls depend specifically on data gathered from other types of API calls executed earlier in a specific order. p  pI need to know when those previous calls have finished so I can use the ivar values I set from their data objects.p  pThat is, I need a way to make API call1, assign assorted return data to ivars, do other stuff with the ivars outside the performRequestWithHandler block, make API call2 and 3, etc., based on what call1 and subsequent API calls returned, and eventually shuffle off to other viewControllers to display the processed data from the multiple API calls return values in various ways.p  pI totally get that performRequestWithHandler is executed on an unspecified thread which will get executed Idontknowwhen. Im not worried about UI long waits due to synced network access latency because I intend to specify very short wait times.  Im not going to make my users sit around waiting for a slow network connection  If the connection is slow, Ill show an activity indicator briefly and give up waiting quickly to show an alert.  That part of the app isnt my challenge of focus here.p  pMy challenge is assembling the returned data from multiple performRequestWithHandler calls in one place emafterem some or all of them have finished.p  pIt looks to me like performRequestWithHandler may be too high level a call to achieve the kind of sync control and data access I need. I dont know.p  pThe code example above was just the simplest way I could think of to isolate and demonstrate my problem in a simple way that compiles. Ive tried many variants but no joy so far.p  pHope this helps clarify the design idea Im working with.p  pThanks for any specific help, clues or ideas you may be able to offer. A minuscule working code sample would be a Godsend at this point, but Ill keep working on it and post a solution ifwhen I find one.p

Negative 183 pIm having some issues with css and inline styles on an email campaign Im doing.p  pFirstly I ended up cheating a bit in that I was hiding elements displaynone to make them appear in the right order when using the media css. The issue here was when displaying on a desktop isp gmail it ignored the displaynone and ended up showing double content in places. So to the double content disappear I used displaynone important which then affected the mobile version.p  pThere are some mobile templates Ive seen online which dont appear to have had much testing as they simply do not work across multiple mail clients.p  pThe code is here if anyone has any suggestions or help a hrefhttpwww.makeyourownmarket.comtesttestdoc.html relnofollowhttpwww.makeyourownmarket.comtesttestdoc.htmlap

Negative 183 pFound similar questions on SO, but nothing that helped. Heres my problemp  pI have a table, events, that will be rather large. Also there are these two tables photos and videos. Every events record has an eid event id. Every photos and videos record has an aeid associated event id.p  pTo grab event data of say 20 events, Im currently running PHP like sop  precodearray  get top 20 events for these 20 events   array[photos]  get all photos   array[videos]  get all videos return events array codepre  pIm finding out that this is running too slow. Probably because that equates to 41 mysql queries. I realize I need use JOIN somehow I think I do at least, but I cant figure our how to structure my query so that it nested the photos and videos in the same way that Im doing it in the pseudocode above. Also, I dont think I have the time to spare to switch over to postgres unless it is very highly suggested Im working with a large enough codebase for that to be a headache with only one dev me.p  pIm willing to read documentsmanuals if you post them.

Negative 183 pIm currently trying to develop a clientserver structure, with the client being in .NET and the server being a PHP based SOAP server.p  pNow, Im trying to implement an asymmetric key system using Rijndael 256 and a bit of fiddling about. I understand the basic concept of a publicprivate key pair as per a hrefhttpwww.howstuffworks.comencryption3.htm relnofollowthis pagea amp Wikipedia, however I cannot get my head around it being secure in any clientside environment.p  pIn short, the software will be running on the client machine, so the user will have the ability to tamper with the software. Most of the clients functionality revolves around responses received from the server in order to display reports amp details. Along with that the client software will occasionally await a command from the server, where the server will tell the client to show a popup or execute a clientprogram shutdown to do with licensing. I realise the server may crash or hang, or the client gets disconnected. Most of this has all been thought over and handled in code. But what Im worried about is someone tampering with the client so that it completely ignores the servers commands.p  pThe customer will have access to a wide variety of toys such as IDA, ILDASM, de4dot and various other debuggers andor decompilers and Im fairly certain an experienced cracker will be able to figure out the publicprivate key combination within a short period of time. I know .NET code on its own is very insecure, but Im not sure what to do against that other then using tools such as .NET Reactor amp Dotfuscator etc.p  pMy question what sort of practices, code, ideas or anything can I put to use in order to either severely delay said cracker, or rather, how do I protect the private key at all costs.p  pAny hints, tips, suggestions or samples very appreciatedp

I dont get any errors, it compiles and runs but it doesnt update the values I want it to in the database. For example, ACCT is the first key and Account is the first value, so when they get passed in they should end up being added to the string I have after the getters, and therefore the database should update ACCTVALSETID to Account Value Set Identifier, right What am I missingp  pThanksp

Negative 183 pA .git directory keeps reappearing in my project, inside a directory that I think should be ignored. It reappears each time I clean the project or refresh it in Eclipse. The duplicated .git directory results in redundant files that prevent the project from building.p  pI have an Android project in Eclipse that links source from a Java project, which is the way LibGDX handles a project. The .git directory that I dont want contains a file that causes a conflict, so I have to delete it every time I want to build to device.p  pIt is creating the directory MyProjectbinclasses.git.  But I have bin in my .gitignore file. My repository is in MyProject.p  pThe conflicting file is binclasses.gitCOMMITEDITMSG. This conflicts with a file in my linked source Java project gen.gitCOMMITEDITMSG. Also the same issue, because I have gen in the .gitignore of that project.p  pI am pretty sure either Eclipse or ADT that is copying the code.gitcode directory over to the codebincode directory when it rebuilds or cleans the project.p  pSo my question now is, how do I get Eclipse andor ADT to stop doing thatp  pemIf you want to see my old .gitignore, which I think is irrelevant because it was set up correctly to ignore the bin directory, you can click the Edited link to see it in this posts history.emp

I believe its safe to say that I must have made an error somewhere, but I cant find where.p  pOne thought I had was that I should keep a counter in the loop to show me how many times the codePerformanceCounter.NextValuecode were accessed generally between 46 and 48, but in the end I believed this shouldnt matter in the grand picture Im still having a too large number for just one second of bandwidth usage. I cant shake the feeling that the performance counter might be the cause though.p  pSidenote the 160MBs number was recorded the moment I loaded a new youtube video and other 1000 KBs recordings are usually done when I refresh a tab, so it should be a relative display of my network usage.p  pHave I overlooked something in my approachp  pEditp  pUpon following Sams advice and checking my results against the builtin codeperfmon.execode I noticed that my bursts in bandwith usage generally occur at the same time as those shown in Perfmon, but mine are way larger.

Negative 183 pHi I currently have a JS file being called to populate my html page with dynamic data. My JS file calls a PHP file to fetch stuff from my sqldb and my PHP file echos jsonencode the stuff it got from the sqldb, which in turn is used to populate the html page. p  pMy problem is that depending on whats in the url ie userBob, I want my js file to call the php file to search for Bob. Right now it searches for current user if userxxxx is not specified. It seems the GET[user] is always null, thus its not being passed because I suspect the JS file working as a middleman.

Negative 183 pI am a beginner in programming though I am quite comfortable with cc. As a part of a project that I have decided to do for fun, I am supposed to build a program for storing and handling huge integers. I know that there are many answers out there but I need ideas that I can implement easily, bearing in mind that I can use any of the basic concepts of CC.p  pHow should I go about itp  pThis is the first time I am asking a question here so please correct me if I am wrong about anything. Thanks.p  pEdit Actually what I wanted to know was how should I go about storing a huge integer... Obviously an array is what comes to mind at first glance but are there any other methods out there at the basic levelp  hr  h2EDIT2 I came across a very nice solution to this problem a while ago, but was just a bit lazy to put it on here. We can use the concept of number systems to deal with huge numbers. We can declare an array that holds the coefficient of powers of 256, thus obtaining a base 256 system. We can then use fundamental concepts like those of the  various number systems to obtain our required results. Thanks a lot anyways.h2

Negative 183 pBackgroundbr  I have a hint box that shows up on focus that changes size as errorinfo messages change.  For example, on blur the box will remain but add error message if validation of the field fails.  Then when the user starts typing the error messgae goes away. All this behavior is controlled with ngshow.  For example the error message is in a div where ngshowhasError.  Thus when the controller sets hasError to true, the box displays the error, which in turn changes the height of the hint box.p  pGoal br  I want to dynamically recenter vertically the box depending on offset height of the box. I due this by resetting the marginbottom on the element.p  pstrongProblemstrong br  Because the height essentially changes due to angulars directive ngshow, Im having a hard time recalculation the tip box height at the right time, in a good way.p  pI can add a handler such as, handleError, which is called when an error is detected. It looks like thisp  precodescope.handleError  function       scope.hasError  true     timeoutresetHeight, 30   codepre  pWithout the timeout code, however, the resize happens BEFORE the error is added, messing up the marginbottom value.  I dont really feel comfortable using a timeout like this as it feels hacky and would fail if the user really does experience some slow down.p  pI also tried using watch like sobr p  precodescope.watchhasError, resetHeight, true codepre  pThis also seems to fire BEFORE the error is shown again, messing up the marginbottom resulting in off center display.p  pSo the question is, in Angular,is there a way to cause some logic to execute AFTER a directive, specifically ngshow Can a specific usage somehow be tied into much like watchp  pThanks,p

In such cases  p  pWe get a runtime error  p  blockquote   pThe mapping of CLR type to EDM type is ambiguous because multiple CLR types match the EDM type Customer.p blockquote  pAfter research we understand this is a known limitation of codeEFcode and there are two alternatives to resolve thisp  pHave data models in a different assembliesp  pRename the entities in the codeEDMXcode filesp  pWe expect a lot of codeEDMXcode files to be created based on the new codeMVC Areascode in the future. Could you please recommend which one of the above options would be better and why Is there any other alternate that we can usep

Negative 183 pI have a simple question. Im trying to detect when a user shakes the iPhone. I have the standard code in place to detect the motion and this works no problem. However, in testing this on my actual phone, Ive realized that you have to shake the device quite hard to get the motion detection to trigger. I would like to know if there is a way to implement a level of sensitivity checking. For example, a way to detect if a user lightly shakes the device or somewhere between light and hard shake.

Negative 183 pWe have a rare production issue on a Notes database. Our system assigns an ID to a request doc during submission saving then submit, in real time. What happens is that sometimes 2 documents appear to have the same ID, which should not be the case.p  pThe ID is in the format YYYYMMXXX, where YYYY  is current year, MM is month in number, XXX is a number starting from 001 then beyond. The system, when assigning id, checks in a view where documents for the same months are there. If it does not see a document, it assigns 001 in the ID, else, it gets the latest document in the view, gets the number, then increment it by 1. The new number will be then assigned as ID.p  pHow can I assure that during this process, I can assign a unique id based on the criteria above The bug is so rare that we cannot simulate it again.

Negative 183 pI have used Google play games to create an Android game with achievements, leaderboard, and realtime multiplayer play.p  pI now would like to include some server related stuff, planning on using google app engine. My understanding is that a Google Play Game backend instance is built atop an app engine instance How would I combine using the google game play API extending BaseGameActivity for its login management and have access to achievements, etc and still use the google app engine for other services exposed via servletsp  pMy main concern would presumably be sharing the authentication I could envision simply making a separate Game play server and a separate app engine server, but then the user would somehow have to log in to each separately, right, being rather annoying.p  pI have tried to search for how to do this, expecting it may be fairly common, but have turned up only a few references that are not exactly what I need, talking obliquely about Auth tokens and such. If those are actually what I need, I may need a step by step guide as to how to take the info from the google play game APIs, and how to send it to the app engine server calls appropriately, so the user only sees the single google play game login.p  pThank youp  pRobp

Negative 183 pIn a small network, say 20 nodes or less, my program, on a test instrument, needs to know Who is out there by MAC not by IP.    I will be plugging into random networks and need to be able to do this without having to know any addresses, MAC or otherwise in the network and knowing I cant rely on DHCP.

The code is shown below p  precode.slidenext.clickfunction     var className  active     if .slide.hasClass.  className          .slide.fadeOutslow      else        codepre  pIf anyone can help, it would be much appreciated. For your information, I coded the slider to add the codeactivecode class based on the element the user clicks on like shown below and it works fine. I just need to know how to identify when a certain slider has the class codeactivecode so that one can be faded out p  precode.slidewelcome.clickfunction      slideshow welcomeSlide.addClassactive.fadeInslow      monitorSlide, manageSlide, maintainSlide.removeClassactive.fadeOutslow   .slidemonitor.clickfunction      slideshow monitorSlide.addClassactive.fadeInslow      welcomeSlide, manageSlide, maintainSlide.removeClassactive.fadeOutslow   .slidemanage.clickfunction      slideshow manageSlide.addClassactive.fadeInslow       monitorSlide, welcomeSlide, maintainSlide.removeClassactive.fadeOutslow   .slidemaintain.clickfunction      slideshow maintainSlide.addClassactive.fadeInslow      monitorSlide, manageSlide, welcomeSlide.removeClassactive.fadeOutslow  codepre

Negative 183 pIve been battling a strange query performance issue.  The query is sometimes running slowly from a website2  4 seconds.  I run a trace and it seems to be CPU overhead.  The trace will show roughly the same amount of CPU time as duration.  The thing I cant figure out is that when I copypaste the query from the trace and run it, it immediately completes and the trace shows it taking roughly 300ms.  I can do the same thing overandover.  Slow on the website, fast in SSMS.  I even converted the query into a view and the select is now just directly querying the view, but Im seeing the same issue.  p  pAnother oddity Ive noticed is that despite the fact that its a very small resultset70ish rows, 13 small columns, the time it takes to run the query correlates with the size of the resultset.  So, if I shift a date parameter to return 20 rows rather than 70, my query time also reduces to about a third the time.  p  pHeres another observation  If I take out the last column and add it back it starts working just fine.  But, when I go away for the day and come back it runs slow again when Im back in the office.  This has happened multiple times.p  pI looked up a way to see the execution plan in a trace.  Its definitely different when its slow, but I cant tell why its slow.p  pAny reason why it would consistently use a different execution plan for the same queryp

Negative 183 pI have inherited an application written in Java that uses JPA to access a database.  The application uses an design pattern that I havent come across before and I would really appricate some guidance on why this pattern is used.  Like many applications, we have a front end, middleware, and back end database.  The database is accessed via DAOs.  Each method on the DAO loads a entityDTO which is just a POJO with nothing but getters and setters and that entityDTO is then passed into a entityproper that has other methods that change the entity state.  An example [class names changed to protect the inocent]p  precodeenum Gender      Male,     Female   class PersonDTO      private String mFirstName     private String mLastName     private Gender mGender     ...

I understand bits about seperation of converns and I also understand bits about the difference between an EAO based design to say an active record based design.p  pBut does it really have to go this far  Should there always be at least one DB object that contains nothing but getters and setters that map to the DB fields p

Negative 183 pHello Im working on a lol appliacation and i have a problem with async tasks and getting data from 2 different json sources .

I dont know how to make those 2 async task wait for each other and then write down the data. Before i managed to solve this problems using static fields and saving data from 1 task and then providing it to the second one but im sure there is another way without the need to use fields and i would like to get it done this way for experience as well... Also now i used loopj library but i still cant combine async tasks. And i cant provide you with the lol api key since it supposed to be private but i hope someone will be able to help me anyway.

I was simply using it in as the login form, username and password.p  pNow that I upgraded to Xcode 5.1 I am getting an error Static table views are only valid when embedded in UITableViewController instancesp  pI found a few work arounds but they were all old a none of them helped me. My View Controller class is a subclass of the UIViewController class. I am also implementing the following two methodsp  precode NSIntegertableViewUITableView tableView numberOfRowsInSectionNSIntegersection      return 2   UITableViewCell tableViewUITableView tableView cellForRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath      UITableViewCell cell      switch indexPath.row          case 0             cell  self.tableViewCellUser             break         case 1             cell  self.tableViewCellPassword             break          return cell  codepre  pThis was working perfectly, but for some reason Xcode 5.1 broke it... Using a container seem to be a overkill as I would need a new view controller just because of two properties...p
Negative 183 pI have a templated class Foo, which is of Type T. When I create an instance of T I want to ensure the constructor is passed the same type. The compiler ensures this, except for the small detail of implicit conversion. I want to prevent these and I cant figure out if there is a good way to do so. Compiler flags are not a option here.

Negative 183 pI am using both OpenMPI and OpenMP shared memory to parallelize a piece of code. I am trying to time that code for benchmarking and speedup purposes, and I dont understand the differences between ompgetwtime and mpiwtime.p  pHere is an outline of what my code does along with the architecture it is running onp  pI have 8 nodes, each of which have 16 processors. I have 128 tasks to run.p  pThere are two scenarios I am testing, and I want to know which one is faster.p  pFirst scenario I give each node 18 of the tasks using OpenMPI, and for each task the node uses its 16 processors using OpenMP to do the task. So Node0 will do Task0, when Task0 completes it will do Task8, when Task8 completes it will do Task16 simultaneously Node1 will do Task1, then Task9, then Task15, etc. until every task is complete. I want to know how long that entire process takes, and it would be nice to know how long each task takes to complete on average.p  pSecond scenario I put each of the 128 tasks on a single processor using MPI. I just want to know how long this takes to run, and again it would be nice to know how long each processor takes to finish its job.p  pBasically what I am doing here is comparing how MPIOpenMP compares to just using MPI for my code.p  pWhich timer should I be using, and what are the differences between the twop  pThanksp

Negative 183 pIm trying to come up with a generic way to intercept C events for processing e.g. logging, filtering, distributing asynchronously etc., before passing the event back on to its original consumer.p  pSo to give an example, in the normal flow of things youd have p  precodeclass EventProducer      public event EventHandlerltintgt OnEvent      internal void FireEvent              if OnEvent  null             OnEventthis, 1        class EventConsumer      public EventConsumerEventProducer producer              producer.OnEvent  eventHandler           public void eventHandlerobject sender, int e              Debug.WriteLineConsumed   e        codepre  pIn my case, Id want to insert an additional step between the two.. something likep  precodeevent consumer class EventConsumer      use this to handle one particular event EventProducer.OnEvent     InterceptEventHandlerltintgt EventHandler      public EventConsumerEventProducer producer              just one line of code to insert an event handler to do what I need         but whoops  cant refer to OnEvent outside of the producer         EventHandler  new InterceptEventHandlerltintgtproducer.OnEvent, eventHandler           public void eventHandlerobject sender, int e              Debug.WriteLineConsumed   e        intercepts events, does something with them, then forwards them to original consumer class InterceptEventHandlerltTgt      public EventHandlerltTgt Callback      public InterceptEventHandlerEventHandlerltTgt eventHook, EventHandlerltTgt callback              save callback         Callback  callback          subscribe ourselves to the specified event         eventHook  interceptHandler           public void interceptHandlerobject sender, T e              do something with the event here         Debug.WriteLineIntercepted   e.ToString          then pass callback back to original consumer         Callbacksender, e       codepre  pThe problem as commented above is that the code doesnt compile because the events themselves are not accessible from outside the producer class. I understand this is because the event handling is implemented as a private class, so cant see any obvious way around this.p  pIs there any way to intercept and chain events that would allow me to keep the standard event syntax in producer classesp  pI realise that I can abandon events, and just use my own equivalent producerconsumer code, but ill lose the normal benefits of events e.g. more readablemaintainable, proper syntax highlightingautocomplete etc.p  pEDIT  I also tried fiddling around with the MulticastDelegate class, but while I got the code to compile, I couldnt get the events to be subscribed effectively OnEvent was always null.p

Negative 183 pIm trying to implement a dynamic height codeUITaleViewCellcode in codeUITableViewcode with XCode6 using Swift.p  pI laid out my cell as following, by setting up the constraints graphicallyScreenshot is from XCode5, because of NDA on XCode6. I also set the BodyLabels Line Break property to Word Wrap, and set the Line number to 0 to allow multiple lines.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comtte6b.png altenter image description herep  pNow if I just set up the cells contents inside codetableViewtableView UITableView, cellForRowAtIndexPath indexPath NSIndexPathcode method, then I get the dynamic height behavior correctly.p  pHowever, since I was following along tutorials available onlinespecifically a hrefhttpswww.youtube.comwatchv6KImie4ZMwkampindex2amplistWLthis onea, I added another method to determine the height of the cell with codetableViewtableView UITableView, heightForRowAtIndexPath indexPath NSIndexPathcode. In the tutorial that I was following, it told me to add codecell.layoutIfNeededcode, so I added that too. p  precodeoverride func tableViewtableView UITableView, heightForRowAtIndexPath indexPath NSIndexPath gt CGFloat       var cell  tableView.dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifierkCellIdentifier as GroupFeedCell       Configure the cell     if let frc  self.fetchedResultsController          let feed  frc.objectAtIndexPathindexPath as GroupFeed         cell.titleLabel.text  feed.name         if let message  feed.message              cell.bodyLabel.text  message                     Layout the cell     cell.layoutIfNeeded       Get the height     var height  CGFloat  cell.contentView.systemLayoutSizeFittingSizeUILayoutFittingCompressedSize.height     return height  codepre  pHowever, when I ran the program, although the table view still displayed the dynamic heights of the cells correctly, it displayed the errors like thisp  precode20140727 135922.599 FBGroups[4631979424] Unable to simultaneously satisfy constraints.     Probably at least one of the constraints in the following list is one you dont want. Try this 1 look at each    constraint and try to figure out which you dont expect 2 find the code that added the unwanted constraint or    constraints and fix it.

The methods in the UIConstraintBasedLayoutDebugging category on UIView listed in ltUIKitUIView.hgt may also be helpful.   codepre  pI tried to figure out what might have gone wrong, and spend good amount of time on it, and I figured out that whenever I delete codecell.layoutIfNeededcode method, then the constraints error disappears.p  pAnd it seemed that among the constraints that are conflicting, codeUIViewEncapsulatedLayoutWidthcode was not the one I added, and other than that, the all of the constraints looked innocent to me. I tried to search through what could generate codeUIViewEncapsulatedLayoutWidthcode constraints, but I couldnt get the satisfying explanation in my situation. I would like to know what would be the cause of this error message and how to resolve this problem.p  pAlso, can someone explain what would be the purpose of calling codecell.layoutIfNeededcode method inside calculating height of the cell, and when it would be necessary Most of the tutorials that were covering dynamic height codeUITableViewCellcode utilized this method, although my program still displayed cells correctly without that method call, and whenever I tried to use that method, it caused the exceptions.p

Negative 183 pThis isnt a compiler bug, except the last example Outer3, because the language reference doesnt say you can do it. But why cant you declare a nested type within a protocol It would be a useful way to group related types. If you try, you get the following errors in beta 4p  precodeprotocol Outer1      protocol Inner1   Type not allowed here   protocol Outer2      struct Inner2   Type not allowed here   protocol Outer3      class Inner3   No error, looks promising  BUT   class Test  Outer3   Type Test does not conform to protocol Outer3 codepre  pThe last example, class within protocol, is intriguing because it hints at a partial implementation where the protocol accepts the nested class but then the protocol cannot be implemented. Does this hint that nested types within protocols are on the cards for Swift 2.0p

The resulting string is a series of   keyvalue pairs separated by amp characters, where both key and value   are quoted using quoteplus above. When a sequence of twoelement   tuples is used as the query argument, the first element of each tuple   is a key and the second is a value. The value element in itself can be   a sequence and in that case, if the optional parameter doseq is   evaluates to True, individual keyvalue pairs separated by amp are   generated for each element of the value sequence for the key. The   order of parameters in the encoded string will match the order of   parameter tuples in the sequence.

Negative 183 pI have multiple texture reads in my fragment shader, and I am supposedly doing strongbad thingsstrong, like using the codediscardcode command and conditionals inside the shader.p  pThe thing is, I am rendering to a texture and I want to reuse it in following passes with other shaders, that do not have to operate on pixels that were previously discarded. This is for performance. The thing is, I need also to discard calculations if uniforms are out of certain ranges which I read from another texture imagine a loop with these shaders running always on the same textures, which are not cleared.p  pSo what I have now, is a terrible performance.

Im new to embedded Linux. The only example code on the web I could find used file descriptors to read and write to port. Is it possible to use the serial channel registers on Mini2440 to transmit and receive serial messagesp

Negative 183 pFirst off, I was reading about the sweepline algorithm to find closest pair of points in ON lgN time over at a hrefhttpcommunity.topcoder.comtcmoduleStaticampd1tutorialsampd2lineSweep relnofollowtopcodera. I mostly understood the algorithm, however when I look at the implementation provided a hrefhttpolympiad.cs.uct.ac.zapresentationscamp12009linesweephandout.pdf relnofollowherea copied and made more readable below, I notice some striking differences.p  precodedefine x first define y second typedef pairltlong long, long longgt pll    ... set ltpllgt boundingBox boundingBox.insertpoints[0] Points have been already sorted by xcoordinate for int i  1 i lt numPoints i      while left lt i ampamp points[i].x  points[left].x gt shortestDistSoFar              boundingBox.erasepoints[left]         left           for auto it  boundingBox.lowerboundpllpoints[i].y  shortestDistSoFar, points[i].x  shortestDistSoFar it  boundingBox.end ampamp itgty lt points[i].y  shortestDistSoFar it              if distit, points[i] lt shortestDistSoFar                      shortestDistSoFar  distit, points[i]             best1  it             best2  points[i]                   boundingBox.insertpoints[i]  codepre  pFirst, in the implementation snippet above, the stdset that holds the points and represents the bounding rectangle is not sorted by ycoordinate instead by xcoordinate which is contrary to what almost every other source says codeThe set is ordered by y coordinate. Topcodercode.p  pNext, even though the set is not sorted by ycoordinate, when the iterator is used to codeconsider points in the active set ... whose y coordinates are in the range yN  h to yN  hcode, it is taken as the lower bound of codepllpoints[i].y  shortestDistSoFar, points[i].x  shortestDistSoFarcode. Why does the codeycode come first I would think that the correct order would be codepllpoints[i].x, points[i].y  shortestDistSoFarcode but changing it to this breaks the algorithm.p  pCan someone please help address these seemingly inconsistent thingsp
Negative 183 pIm working on an Alloy model whose subject matter I am finding a bit complicated. To try to control the complexity, I have a layered the model into multiple modules, along the lines of base.als, level1.als, level2.als, etc., each model importing the preceding one in the sequence.  And I have b spent some time trying to make the visualizations as clear as I can manage.p  pThese two efforts seem to be fighting each other.  The adjustments I make in the theme when working on level2.als are not visible when I apply the theme to an instance of base.als, because when Im working with base.als signatures S1 and S2 are known in the theme as S1 and S2, and when Im working with level2.als they will be known instead as level1baseS1 and level1baseS2.  And so on.  From the point of view of the theme, I dont seem to have a layered model where S1 and S2 are defined in one layer and refined in other layers I seem instead to have from the POV of the theme to have several essentially unrelated models.p  pI believe I understand why this is so  I guess that the visualizer is being careful because parameterized modules, especially, may need to be imported more than once with different aliases, and in those cases XYSig23 and XZSig23 must be distinguished.  The namespace qualifiers make that happen and cannot be lightly dispensed with.p  pBut its still driving me crazy not to be able to look at instances of the different layers in my model using the same theme.  It might not bother me as much, but as I said Im finding this model a challenge, and I need as much help as I can get, understanding whats going on.p  pAliasing does not seem to help, at least in the simple form in which Ive tried it  replacing codeopen basecode and codeopen level1code with codeopen base as Bcode and codeopen level1 as L1code merely exacerbated the problem for a bit, since now the theme rules for level1baseS1 and level1baseS2 no longer fired until I changed them all to L1BS1 and L1BS2.p  pManually removing the modulepath qualifiers changing L1BS1 to S1, etc. makes a theme that works for base.als but not for level1.als or level2.als.  The visualizer, that is, seems to require fully qualified names whether the unqualified versions of the names are ambiguous or not.p  pIs there a workaround short of having different themes for each layer in the model and writing a set of sed scripts to propagate changes to any theme to all the other related themesp

The function that I call for parallel processing is passed a large list of lists. The function iterates through the list and does some work.

Negative 183 pon parse I have strongUsersstrong and strongEventsstrong. Events has a strongdatestrong attribute that tells when will the event begin. p  pUsers can attend to a scheduled event. What I want to do is that if user has some event next day the app should notify him at 7pm on a day before the event happens. If user dont have any event scheduled for next day then he shouldnt be notifyied. p  pWhat is the most efficient way to do this with parse What I think itll work is to create a function on parse Cloud that runs once a day and fetch all the events that are scheduled for the next day and send them scheduled push. The only problem I see is that querying Events is probably limit to 1000 in case there will be more than 1000 events scheduled for one day and if scheduled push from Cloud code takes into account time localization. Whatll be your approach to do that. p  pAlso I need to tell, that all the events have an array of users that will attend the Event so sending a push to them isnt hard to do it and this code is already done and it works. p

Negative 183 pBeing the sports nerd that I am, Im looking to take daily XML files that are produced by the Major League Baseball Website, and import them into either an Access or MySQL database. The issue Im running into, is that almost every XML file they produce is just slightly different than the last. For example, one game file may have a field named codebatter23code that is next to codeevent22code while the other file calls it codebatter24codeand is next to codepitcher25code. I know that XML files can be inconsistent, but I know there has to be a way to consistently get the data into a database. Is there anyway to standardize these XML files Some code that will parse each file in a list, and organize them into a specific style and giving them consistent field names Currently I import the XML file into a Excel sheet first, where I change the file type to a CSV, but from there the field names and column locations are still different from file to file.p  pMy goal is to have all the files in a structure where I can quickly import them into a database each day, without having to manually change column locations, or field names. Im open to any and all options, but my experience in most languages are rookie level at best, so forgive me for my lack of knowledge. p

If we look at it like the previous code codeabc1or every thing else shows eofncode should have been saved in the buffer and first codeacode go to the first getchar first time loop works the codebcode passes to second getchar then codeccode passes to the third mdash and then code1codeshould have been passed to codecgetcharcode  and its against the condition and loop should terminate.p  pHowever, instead it prints codegtcode and loop continued and new line the last item in the buffer doesnt print.

Negative 183 pIm creating an app that retrieves the text within a tweet, store it in the database and then display it on the browser.

Negative 183 pIl start by letting a picture do some talking.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comqmckL.jpg altMVVM User Control to Window wireframep  pSo you see, I want to create a WPF user control that supports binding to a parent windows DataContext. The user control is simply a Button and a ListBox with a custom ItemTemplate to present things with a Label and a Remove Button.p  pThe Add button should call an ICommand on the main view model to interact with the user in selecting a new thing instance of IThing. The Remove buttons in the ListBoxItem in the user control should similarly call an ICommand on the main view model to request the related things removal. For that to work, the Remove button would have to send some identifying information to the view model about the thing requesting to be removed. So there are 2 types of Command that should be bindable to this control. Something like AddThingCommand and RemoveThingCommandIThing thing.p  pI got the functionality working using Click events, but that feels hacky, producing a bunch of code behind the XAML, and rubs against the rest of the pristine MVVM implementation. I really want to use Commands and MVVM normally.p  pTheres enough code involved to get a basic demo working, I am holding off on posting the whole thing to reduce confusion. What is working that makes me feel like Im so close is the DataTemplate for the ListBox binds the Label correctly, and when the parent window adds items to the collection, they show up.p  precodeltLabel ContentBinding PathDisplayName gt codepre  pWhile that displays the IThing correctly, the Remove button right next to it does nothing when I click it.p  precodeltButton CommandBinding PathRemoveItemCommand, RelativeSourceRelativeSource AncestorTypexType userControlCommandsItemManager gt codepre  pThis isnt terribly unexpected since the specific item isnt provided, but the Add button doesnt have to specify anything, and it also fails to call the command.p  precodeltButton CommandBinding PathAddItemCommand, RelativeSourceRelativeSource AncestorTypexType userControlCommandsItemManager gt codepre  pSo what I need is the basic fix for the Add button, so that it calls the parent windows command to add a thing, and the more complex fix for the Remove button, so that it also calls the parent command but also passes along its bound thing.p  pMany thanks for any insights,p
Negative 183 pOne feature that plays a prominent role in many of the writings on data oriented design is that there are many cases where rather than AoS array of structsp  precodestruct CAoS    int    foo   double bar   stdvectorltCAoSgt cs ... stdcout ltlt cs[42].foo ltlt stdendl codepre  pit is more efficient to arrange ones data in SoA struct of arraysp  precodestruct CSoA    stdvectorltintgt    foo   stdvectorltdoublegt bar   CSoA cs ... stdcout ltlt cs.foo[42] ltlt stdendl codepre  pNow what I am looking for is a solution which would allow me to switch between AoS and SoA without changing the calling interface, i.e. that I could, with minimal effort and with no extra runtime cost at least to the point of excessive indirection, call e.g. codecs[42].foocode regardless of which arrangement of data Im using. p  pI should note that the example syntax above is the ideal case, which might very well be impossible, but Id be very interested in close approximations, too.

Negative 183 pI have been working on a graph implementation for the last few days. All of this is really new to me, and I am stuck on two parts of my implementation. I am implementing a digraph of courses from an input file. From the file, I can determine which courses are prereqs for other courses. I then create a digraph with courses as nodes, and edges connecting courses that are prereqs. I also want to find the total number of nodes and edges, and perform a topological sort on the graph I will later be adding weights to the edges. Here is my implementation.p  pFinding the number of nodes was easy just return codework.sizecode. I have confirmed this is working properly. I am lost on how I would return the number of edges in my graph. It seems it would be simple, but everything I tried doesnt work. Secondly, I am completely lost on how to perform a topological sort on this graph. Any assistance is appreciated.p

Negative 183 pIm working with some third party tools that generate xcode project files for a few subcomponents.  Their tools generate the project files with Generate PositionDependent Code set to YES potentially because the tool generates project files for OS X builds too and the latest update has it confused.p  pWhile I could simply turn these flags off in the GUI, its not as convenient as my build process is scripted to generate each project file, build it, move binaries around, lipo them together, etc.  p  pIm fairly sure these settings can be overridden on the command line, but Im curious as to what the setting key actually is.  For instance, I dont know if the settingvalue means that the setting name is verbatim to how it displays in Xcode Generate PositionDependent Code, as there are spaces in it.  p  pIf anyone can provide a listing of all settings that can be passed to xcodebuild, that would be super.p

Negative 183 pI have to configure Nginx to accept client selfsigned certificates.  The problem is that certificates should be prepared by clients themselves and signed by them. I know drawbacks of such approach but this is customer requirement.  Currently Nginx is configured to accept client certificates signed by my own CAuntrusted. sslclientcertificate points to ca.crt.  Customer wants about 100 client certificates, each of them signed by a different untrusted CA  not chained.

Negative 183 pHi all and thanks in advance for your help.p  pI have a quiz with 3 categories that uses shared object, and xml within php. Im not grasping the shared object and xml aspect. The quiz works well if one player only plays. But if I set it to log out using externalinterface window.close then log in again it retains the scores from the round prior to the one the one just played. The actual scores are updating in the database just fine. But if the player logs back in the shared object hasnt updated. It does so though if the browser if closed off for some time. I think then it is getting the data from the database and not the shared object.p  pSo say... player 1 scores 200 in a new game ... totalscore is now 400. The score submits to the database.  Player 1 logs out. Player 2 logs in. Hasnt played for awhile. The score from the database loads.  Player 2 logs out. Player 1 logs back in but the shared object score loads from before ie 200. Even though I think am loading the score using xml... and flushing the shared object before the scores submit to the databasep  pPHP looks like this...p  precode if todo  login     result  mysqliqueryconnect, SELECT  FROM nameTable WHERE userpass  userpass   AND username  username       if result     msg  isobjectconnect  mysqlierrorconnect  mysqlires  mysqliconnecterror  mysqlires  false    string  valid0amperrerror query      else       if mysqlinumrowsresult 0           string  valid0amperrno result        else             headerContentType textxml          echo ltxml version1.0gt          echo lt.nameTable.gt              while data  mysqlifetcharrayresult                             echo ltplayergt                echo ltusernamegt.data[username].ltusernamegt               echo ltuserpassgt.data[userpass].ltuserpassgt               echo ltuserscoregt.data[userscore].ltuserscoregt               echo ltcat1gt.data[cat1].ltcat1gt              echo ltcat2gt.data[cat2].ltcat2gt              echo ltcat3gt.data[cat3].ltcat3gt               end while            end if else result       end if else result   end if else login  codepre  pAS3 login user is this...p  precode         else ife.currentTarget.name  loginbtn               var usString  mcnow.loginuser.text         var paString  mcnow.loginpass.text         ifus.length gt 0 ampamp pa.length gt 0  getXMLfilePHPtodologinampusernameusampuserpasspa, login         positioningInterfacelogin, 0, 0      codepre  pLoadUser in AS3 is this...p  precodefunction LoadUsereEventvoid       traceLoadUser user is loaded      xmlLoader.removeEventListenerEvent.COMPLETE, LoadUser      myxml  new XMLe.target.data      tracelen,myxml.username  undefined, myxml.length gt 0      ifmyxml.username  undefined           positioningInterfacewelcome, 0, 0         welcome.usernametxt.text  myxml.username         welcome.msg1txt.text  Welcome Back         welcome.msg2txt.text  We hope you are enjoying playing this quiz         welcome.displayscore.text  myxml.userscore         mySO.data.registered  isRegistered  true           nameActive  myxml.username         TotalScore  myxml.userscore          cat1  myxml.cat1         cat2  myxml.cat2         cat3  myxml.cat3          mySO.data.cat1  cat1         mySO.data.cat2  cat2         mySO.data.cat3  cat3          mySO.data.userSO  nameActive         mySO.data.TotalScore  TotalScore  TotalScore is the sum of the category scores          mySO.flush          traceLoadUser,mySO.data.userSO         else               if login failed, display login again, failed login text, clear text         positioningInterfacelogin, 0, 0         login.loginuser.text  Login Failed         setTimeoutfunction login.loginuser.text  login.loginpass.text  , 1000      codepre  pp  pgetSO and fillSO are correct I think. varSend is working properly submitting the scores.  As said everything works well until the player logs out. Ive tried clearing the shared object on log out so a new player can log in works ok but if the first player logs back after the 2nd player the SO for player 1 has not updated.

Negative 183 pI am following Accelerated C by Koenig and Moo to learn C, using Eclipse as my IDE and the MinGW tool chain. Chapter 4 teaches about the struct concept using a pretty simple multifile example program which emulates reading in a series of student grades and outputs the averages. The struct it defines is called Studentinfo. Here is Studentinfo.hp  precodeifndef STUDENTINFOHGUARD define STUDENTINFOHGUARD  include ltiostreamgt include ltstringgt include ltvectorgt  struct Studentinfo      stdstring name     double midterm, final     stdvectorltdoublegt homework   bool compareconst Studentinfoamp, const Studentinfoamp stdistreamamp readstdistreamamp, Studentinfo stdistreamamp readhwstdistreamamp, stdvectorltdoublegtamp  endif  STUDENTINFOHGUARD  codepre  pThere are no errors associated with compare, read or readhw.p  pThe problem I am having is that even though the simple variable declaration below seems to work,p  precodeinclude Studentinfo.h  int main  vectorltStudentinfogt students Studentinfo record stringsizetype maxlen  0 ....  codepre  pin the sense that the Eclipse code editor signals via i its color coding that it has found the data type ii when I mouseover, it shows me the underlying Studentinfo definition in the hover box and iii the code associated with the variable record doesnt generate errors.p  pHowever, when I try to use the students vector within main, I get could not be resolved errors on the property names or invalid arguments for functions which try to pass the variables. For example,p  precodeforvectorltStudentinfogtsizetype i0 istudents.size i      cout ltlt students[i].name             ltlt stringmaxlen1  students[i].name.size,   ....  codepre  pproduces a Method size could not be resolved error and a Field name could be resolved error.p  pIts very odd to me, as I said, because mouseover of the vector students declaration at the beginning of main produces a hover box with the correct struct definition, indicating the include file is being found and contains the intended definition with the name property defined as a string.p  pIve been trying to solve this for a couple of days and have searched the web and this site, as well as going over all the code many times. The code seems to be exactly what is in the book and its not too difficult to figure out what it is supposed to be doing.

Negative 183 pI have a 2D sidescrolling game. Right now, in order to jump, the player must be touching the ground. Therefor, I have a boolean, isOnGround, that is set to YES when the player collides with a tile object, and no when the player jumps. This generates a LOT of calls to didBeginContact method, slowing down the game.p  pFirstly, how can I optimise this by using one big physics body for the tiles on the floor for example clustering multiple adjacent tiles into one single physics bodyp  pSecondly, is this even efficient Is there a better way to detect if the play is on the ground My current method opens up a lot of bugs, for example wall jumping. If a player collides with a wall, isOnGround becomes YES and allows the player to jump.p

Im parsing some log files that log by the millisecond so theres a lot in this time frame, and it throws an unparsable error only for those ten minutes in the log files for some reason. Ive tried looking into everything and it looks like a real date to me. One thing that does fix it is setLenienttrue But Id like to know why with setLenientfalse it fails Java 7 on Windows 7p

Negative 183 pIm starting to learn neural networks, and I just made a program that learned how to recognize handwritten digits with pretty good accuracy trained with backpropagation. Now I want to be able to see what the network thinks a perfect number looks like essentially getting a pixel array which produces a desired number but is not from the dataset. My research has come up empty, but I posted on another site and was suggested to look at backpropagating to the input. I dont have much of a math background, so could someone point me in the right direction on how to implement that or any other method of achieving my goalp

Negative 183 pI have an application consisting of an .exe and a .dll, which are packaged in a setup.exe thats built with InstallShield Limited Edition in Visual Studio. I want to distribute the application on the Internet, and am trying to understand what I need to do in terms of code signing to avoid warning messages from Windows at download and install time. Although VS provides the ability to sign files, would it be preferable to buy a digital certificate from a CA such as DigiCert, Comodo, Symantec, etc. Do I just need to sign the setup.exe and not the 2 .NET assemblies Because I notice that once the install is complete, the application itself runs without warnings In Windows 8.1 anyway  or is the OS ao browser smart enough to look inside the setup.exe file at the assemblies at download or install time p

Negative 183 pWhen using XCTests in XCode or any unit testing for that matter, typically each file contains a subclass of XCTestCase of some sort and all functions in that class startingending with tests are run. The class may have variables, and there is a setUptearDown function.p  pIn an application, I am writing various drivers serial port for hardware devices linear motion stages, or XYZ stages, Sutter Instruments.  I have a highlevel controller that accepts moveTo and readPosition, which it then sends to a serial port class that actually sends it to the device. But I programmed everything such that I could testuse my highlevel controller even when no real device is connected with a debug serial port class that mimicks the actual device.  This allows me to test 1 my highlevel controller when I use my debug serial port, and 2 the actual device when it is connected and 3 indirectly, my good understanding of protocol for the device if I can mimick it right, I must be understanding something.p  pI have various tests that can run in both situations, and I can easily test with or without a real device connected.  However, the way I currently run my tests is dumb my test class has an object under test which I construct to be either 1 the real device with actual devttyxxxx path or 2 the debug serial port that will act as if a real device was connected. strongI manually change it to test either onestrong. This feels wrong.p  pI thought of calling the tests from the original TestCase from a different file, but this also feels incorrect since I will then need to add each function manually and update that list every time I make a change.p  pI thought of making a single function that takes an argument for either situation and calls all the tests, but then I would lose many benefits of unit testing because any failure will just show up as a single, big failed test, not individual tests.p  pThe closest to something elegant I have found is to subclass my original testclass but I change the setUp function.  This sounds like a perfect  solution, but for some reason the tests of the superclass dont appear to be treated like genuine tests they vanish from the report in the sidebar.p  pMy question is then how can I run the same series of tests on two or more different inputs p

Negative 183 pI came across something called a SoThink decompiler. It claims to be able to decompile any swf file to fla. if that is true, any program can be plagiarized. I downloaded a trial version and and tried decompiling a few of my projects. while all the assets were seen in the decompiled fla file, it said that the .as files can be made only in a licensed version. if anyone has experience in this can you let me know if all my program is at risk at a cost of 50 or is there a way to protect itp

I need to convert this codeIListltTgtcode interface to codeListltTgtcode class. I can use code.ToListcode extension method which internally creates a new instance of codeListltTgtcode by passing IEnumrable this argument to its constructor see a hrefhttpreferencesource.microsoft.comSystem.CoreSystemLinqEnumerable.cs,833 relnofollowherea. Generic codeListltTgtcode constructor just iterates through this enumberable. So I would like to prevent this iteration if its not necessary in case inner items parameter is already a codeListltTgtcode. So, is it an optimal way in terms of performance and readability to do this codeInnerList  items as ListltTgt  items.ToListcode If no, please provide with details about better way and why.p
