Positive 15475 pI am working with DEAP. I am evaluating a population currently 50 individuals against a large dataset 400.000 columns of 200 floating points.

Positive 15475 pI frequently use parallel processing under both python multiprocessing library and r snow, etc packages.

Positive 15475 pemScenarioemp  pI currently have a class strongcodeMyLoadBalancerSingletoncodestrong that manages access to a cluster of resources strongcoderesource1codestrong and strongcoderesource2codestrong. The class has methods emcreatecountem and emdeletecountem. When these methods get called, the load balancer would queue up the request and then processes it FIFO on the resources.p  pNaturally, there should be only one load balancer running otherwise each theyll all think they have complete control over the resources being managed.p  pemHere is the problemem p  pMultiple users will simultaneously try to access the load balancer from a GUI. Each user will spawn their own GUI via codepython gui.pycode on the same machine. They will all ssh into the same machine As such, each GUI will be running in its own process. The GUI will then attempt to communicate with the load balancer.p  pIs it possible to have those multiple GUI processes access only one loadbalancer process and call the load balancers methodsp  pI looked into the codemultiprocessingcode library and it appears that the workflow is opposite to what I want. Using my example it would be Loadbalancer process spawns 2 GUI processes child and then shares the parent resources with the child. In my example, both the GUI and the load balancer are top level processes. No parentchild relationshipp  pI suspect that Singleton is not the right word as singletons only work within one process. Maybe run the load balancer as a daemon process and then have those GUI processes connect to it I tried searching IPC but it just lead me to the codemultiprocessingcode module which is not what I want. The codedistributed, cluster computing modules dispycode isnt what I want either. This is strictly processes communicating with each other IPC on the same machine.p  pWhich brings me to my original question emIs it possible to allow multiple processes to connect to a singleton process and invoke method calls or access its resources All processes will be executing on the same machine.emp  pFictitious pseudocodep  pLoadBalancer.pyp  precodeclass MyLoadBalancerSingletonobject     def init          Singleton instance logic here          Resource logic here     def createcount         resource1.createcount         resource2.createcount     def deletecount         resource1.deletecount         resource2.deletecount codepre  pGui.pyp  precodeclass GUIobject     def eventloop          count  Ask for user input          process  Locate load balancer process          process.createcount          process.deletecount codepre  pThank you for your timep

Positive 15475 pI am developping a script where I create objects at random but I dont want duplicates. They are stored and each time I create a new one I check it against the already existing ones. As I want to do it for large numbers of objects, I am now trying to parallelize it but so far with no success. I tried some solutions found on the web mainly here in fact but still not working.p  pThe idea is that I launch a pool and map my function to it. When a process finds a match, it sets a value to 1. This value is readable by all processes, they can write it using a lock and I need it at the end to return. Thus I made a codeLockcode and a codeValuecode, so that all processes can read the value hence the codelockFalsecode and check if a match has been found in another process. Then I tried something different with an codeEventcode and checking if it is set but this is still not working...

Heres an examplep  precodeimport multiprocessing as mp  print start initialdata  initialcalculationsseed   def childdata     called by mp.Pool     process data with initialdata into results and return initialdata does not change  def setup     called by main process     generate and return data on how to process initialdata   def finalresults     called by main process     assemble final results and write to log file   if name  main      cpus  mp.cpucount      data  setup      p  mp.Poolcpus      try         resultsp.mapchild, data         p.close         p.join      except         p.terminate         p.join         raise      finalprocessresults     print yay codepre  pI gather that a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions10721915sharedmemoryobjectsinpythonmultiprocessingunixa forks this code and so initialdata only calculated once and is shared by all subprocesses started by pool. On windows however, it starts up a new subprocess meaning initialdata is recalculated in each. But how exactly This is what Im wondering about. For the example code above, initialdata only takes a few seconds whereas child can take many hours. Data would be a list of arguments to work on that is far longer than the number of suprocesses that can be started.p  pSay that cpus  8. Does pool create 8 versions of this, recalculate the initialdata and then run child repeatedly until data is exhausted or does it keep creating new versions of this codeonly up to 8 at a time until the data is exhausted That is, does pool do something likep  precodechunk data into equal amounts for each process subdata start each process printing start and recalculating initialdata then in each process  for i in subdata      childi  return results codepre  por does it do something likep  precodefor i in data     start process printing start and recalculating initialdata     childi     if numprocesses gt 8 wait return results codepre  pp  pThe first way I would be fine with, as the initial data is calculated only 8 times but the amount of time child takes far outweighs this. My code is currently set up thinking it is in this manner. Though making it such that its only calculated once would be even better.p  pThe second way however becomes a problem as the initial data begins to add some significant amount of time to the whole operation. I have some ideas on how to handle it if it does do it this way, but I want to avoid doing rewriting if Python doesnt continually start up new processes.p
Positive 15475 pI observed this behavior when trying to create nested child processes in Python. Here is the parent program codeparentprocess.pycodep  precodeimport multiprocessing import childprocess  pool  multiprocessing.Poolprocesses4 for i in range4         pool.applyasyncchildprocess.run,  pool.close pool.join codepre  pThe parent program calls the run function in the following child program childprocess.pyp  precodeimport multiprocessing  def run         pool  multiprocessing.Poolprocesses4         print TEST         pool.close         pool.join codepre  pWhen I run the parent program, nothing was printed out and the program exited quickly. However, if codeprint TESTcode is moved one line above before the nested child processes are created, codeTESTcode are printed for 4 times.p  pBecause errors in a child process wont print to screen, this seems to show that the program crashes when a child process creates its own nested child processes.p  pCould anyone explain what happens behind the scene Thanksp

Positive 15475 pIm trying to parallelize in some simple way my Machine Learning code that originally uses Shogun Machine Learning toolbox.

After getting the results back, it has to then send back the completed batch of requests back to the codeworkercode processes such that emthe worker that requested it receives it backem li ul  pOne could envision doing this with a number of queues. Since the number of codeworkercode processes is variable, it would be ideal if codegpuProccode had a single input queue into which codeworkercodes put their job request and their specific return queue as a tuple.

Positive 15475 pIs there any way to check the progress or current number of iterations of a codemultiprocessing.Poolcode from the python stdlib I know that it accepts a generator so I dont necessarily need it to tell me what total percent it is at, but it would be great to have an idea of progress  the number of iterations, or possibly even have a callback to emit output every x iterations.p  pIm using this as a CLI tool, and would like to give users some idea of how long it will take before all the iterations finish, or even just provide some feedback for how quickly progress is being made this process is a regionofinterest extractor for image values and depends heavily on disk IO, so it can be relatively quick or drag on forever depending on current load, and it would be nice for users to know which.p  pIm imagining something like thisp  precodedef itercallbacki     if not i  10         print Done d...   i  p  multiprocessing.pool l  range1000 data  p.maplambda x return x, l, itercallback codepre  pShould print...p  precodeDone 10...

I dont need any fancy pipes  queues  statesharing since this is embarrassingly parallel, and Id rather not rewrite codePoolcode, but would be open to using other parts of the codemultiprocessingcode lib.

Positive 15475 pI am a newbie in python programming. I started a project for a scoretable. The concecpt is very easy. 2 Players, there scores should be raised and a timer that increases. No problem so far. In addition the whole thing should be controlled by a Wii remote controller. I started to implement the wiiconnection code using threading. If I now execute the code and connect the wii controller the execution becomes more than slow and output comes only sporadically. The strange thing is, if I now attach strace to that process it runs normal, if its killed its slow again and so on. Did anyone saw that kind of behavior  After that I tried to implement the wii connection using multiprocessing. That worked normal so far, but now I got the problem that I cannot call other windows gtk because of the 2 processes that access the same handlers for connecting to the Xserver.

Negative 15475 pIm trying to use jQuery in a bookmarklet, which means I dont have control of the page into which the JavaScript will be inserted.  From what Ive read of a hrefhttpdocs.jquery.comCorejQuery.noConflict relnofollownoConflicta, it requires that jQuery be inserted first.  In the case of a bookmarklet, just the opposite is true.p  pSo  does anyone have any suggestions on whether or not this is possible  Ive found it works except on pages that are using prototype.js.  On those pages, when I try to use the jQuery UI library, I get the error this.cloneNode is not a function in the bowels of jQuery, presumably because something in prototype is mucking with it.p  pAny helpadvice would be appreciated.p

Negative 15475 pConsider a very simple strongUITableViewstrong with one of two states.p  pFirst statep  ul liOne overall table footerli liOne section containing two rows, a section header, and a section footerli ul  pSecond statep  ul liNo table footerli liOne section containing four rows and no section headerfooterli ul  pIn both cases, each row is essentially one of four possible strongUITableViewCellstrong objects, each containing its own strongUITextFieldstrong. We dont even bother with reuse or caching, since were only dealing with four known cells in this case. Theyve been created in an accompanying XIB, so we already have them all wired up and ready to go.p  pNow consider we want to toggle between the two states.p  pSounds easy enough. Lets suppose our view controllers right bar button item provides the toggling support. Well also track the current state with an ivar and enumeration.p  pTo be explicit for a sec, heres how one might go from state 1 to 2. Presume we handle the bar button items title as well. In short, we want to clear out our tables footer view, then insert the third and fourth rows. We batch this inside an update block like sop  precode Brute forced references to the third and fourth rows in section 0 NSUInteger row02[]  0, 2 NSUInteger row03[]  0, 3  [self.tableView beginUpdates] state  tableStateTwo  internal iVar, not a property self.tableView.tableFooterView  nil [self.tableView insertRowsAtIndexPaths[NSArray arrayWithObjects     [NSIndexPath indexPathWithIndexesrow02 length2],     [NSIndexPath indexPathWithIndexesrow03 length2], nil]     withRowAnimationUITableViewRowAnimationFade]   [self.tableView endUpdates] codepre  pFor the reverse, we want to reassign the table footer view which, like the cells, is in the XIB ready and waiting, and remove the last two rowsp  precode Use row02 and row03 from earlier snippet  [self.tableView beginUpdates]   state  tableStateOne self.tableView.tableFooterView  theTableFooterView [self.tableView deleteRowsAtIndexPaths[NSArray arrayWithObjects     [NSIndexPath indexPathWithIndexesrow02 length2],     [NSIndexPath indexPathWithIndexesrow03 length2], nil]     withRowAnimationUITableViewRowAnimationFade]   [self.tableView endUpdates] codepre  pNow, when the table asks for rows, its very cut and dry. The first two cells are the same in both cases. Only the last two appeardisappear depending on the state. The state ivar is consulted when the Table View asks for things like number of rows in a section, height for headerfooter in a section, or view for headerfooter in a section.p  pThis last bit is also where Im running into trouble.p  pUsing the above logic, section 0s headerfooter does not disappear. Specifically, the footer stays below the inserted rows, but the header now overlays the topmost row. If we switch back to state one, the section footer is removed, but the section header remains.p  pHow about using code[self.tableView reloadData]code then Sure, why not. We take care not to use it inside the update block, per Apples advisement, and simply add it after codeendUpdatescode.p  pThis time, good news The section 0 headerfooter disappears. p  pHowever ...p  pToggling back to state one results in a most exquisite mess The section 0 header returns, only to overlay the first row once again instead of appear above it. The section 0 footer is placed below the last row just fine, but the overall table footer  now reinstated  overlays the section footer. Waaaaaah  now whatp  pJust to be sure, lets toggle back to state two again. Yep, that looks fine. Coming back to state one Yecccch.p  pI also tried sprinkling in a few other stunts like using codereloadSectionswithRowAnimationcode, but that only serves to make things worse.p  precodeNSRange range  0, 1 NSIndexSet indexSet  [NSIndexSet indexSetWithIndexesInRangerange]  ...  [self.tableView reloadSectionsindexSet withRowAnimationUITableViewRowAnimationFade] codepre  pCase in point If we invoke codereloadSections...code just before the end of the update block, changing to state two hides the first two rows from view, even though the space they would otherwise occupy remains. Switching back to state one returns section 0s headerfooter to normal, but those first two rows remain invisible.p  pCase two Moving codereloadSections...code to just after the update block but before codereloadDatacode results in emallem rows becoming invisible I refer to the row as being invisible because, during tracing, codetableViewcellForRowAtIndexPathcode emisem returning bonafide cell objects for those rows.p  pCase three Moving codereloadSections...code after codetableViewcellForRowAtIndexPathcode brings us a bit closer, but the section 0 headerfooter never returns when switching back to state one. p  pHmm. Perhaps its a faux pas using both codereloadSections...code emandem codereloadDatacode, based on what Im seeing at tracetime, which brings us top  pCase four Replacing codereloadDatacode with codereloadSections...code outright. All cells in state two disappear. All cells in state one remain missing as well though the space is kept.p  pSo much for that theory. p  pTracing through the code, the cell and view objects, as well as the section heights, are all where they should be at the opportune times. They just arent rendering sanely. strongUpdatestrong The view heights are NOT the same, but I didnt change them either See my posted answer for more info.p  pSo, how to crack this case Clues welcomeappreciatedp
Negative 15475 pIm building a game in as3 that has balls moving and bouncing off the walls. When the user clicks an explosion appears and any ball that hits that explosion explodes too. Any ball that then hits that explosion explodes and so on.p  pMy question is what would be the best class structure for the balls. I have a level system to control levels and such and Ive already come up with working ways to code the balls. Heres what Ive done.p  pMy first attempt was to create a class for Movement, Bounce, Explosion and finally Orb. These all extended each other in the order I just named them. I got it working but having Bounce extend Movement and Explosion extend Bounce, it just doesnt seem very object oriented because what if I wanted to add a box class that didnt move, but did explode I would need a separate class for that explosion. p  pMy second attempt was to create Movement, Bounce and Explosion without extending anything. Instead I passed in a reference to the Orb class to each. Then the class stores that reference and does what it needs to do based on events that are dispatched by the Orb such as update, which was broadcast from Orb every enter frame. This would drive the movement and bounce and also the explosion when the time came. This attempt worked as well but it just doesnt seem right.p  pIve also thought about using Interfaces but because they are more of an outline for classes, I feel like code reuse goes out the window as each class would need its own code for a specific task even if that task is exactly the same.p  pI feel as if Im searching for some form of multiple inheritance for classes that as3 does not support. p  pCan someone explain to me a better way of doing what Im attempting to do Am I being to Object Oriented by having classed for Movement, Bounce, Explosion and Orb Are Interfaces the way to go Any feedback is appreciatedp

Negative 15475 pI am building an iphone app and would like to keep track of how many times it has been opened so that I can prompt the user to do certain actions after it has been opened X number of times. I have thought about storing a variable in Core Data which I update every time it is opened, but this seems like a waste since it is a singleton data, not multiple instances of an object. What is the best way to store data like this and access it without slowing down the app opening timep

Negative 15475 pIm using CMake to build my project. The project uses some parts of the vxl httpvxl.sourceforge.net library.

The only one emproblematicem thing could be the use of shaders available only from Qt 4.7, but its code is trivial.  li liive made use of OpenGLProfiler and Instruments. Nothing specialstrange was observed.li ul  pSome things i suspect conclusions  p  ul liits clear its not a hardware issue. The same computer behave differentlyli liit gives me the sensation its a threadinglocking problem but, whyli licarbon is 32 bits. The 10.5 application was 64. Its not possibly develop 64 bits in carbon.li lifor giving away the 32 bits possible cause, i also rebuild the first project for 32 bits. It worked partically the same.li liive read something about carbon having problems more than usual with context switching.li limaybe OpenGL implementation is Multithread and code is not or the opposite That could cause a lot of stalls.li limaybe carbon handle events differently from cocoas i mean signalevent dispatching, main loop...li ul  pOk, this is sorry for the so long writing my actual headache.

Negative 15475 pI am looking at Ogre3D code and WildMagic code and I found that both deal with their core classes a bit differently. Since I am creating my own core, I was wondering which would be better practice and could potentially be better in terms of resources.p  pIn WildMagic, there is a Matrix class which inherits from a Table class not polymorphic. The table class can have N row and N cols and gets getters and setters for the columns and rows. The Matrix class then has functionality that only makes sense for a Matrix and it conveniently inherits from Table. A vector can then also inherit from Table in this case although WildMagic does not do it. WildMagic also has a Transform object that stores local and derived transformations for a Node. So a Node will have two Transform objects that contain the necessary transformations which include position, rotation, scale.p  pIn Ogre3D on the other hand, the Matrix class does not derive from anything and Ogre3Ds node has variables to store the local and derived positions codeVector localPos Vector derPos Matrix localRot Matrix derRot etc.codep  pNow keep in mind these are core objects that will be usedupdatedmodified thousands of times per frame and it is quite hard to change them if you realize you have a performance bottleneck down the road when you have a full game relying on these core classes.p  pSo now questions arep  ol liIs there a cost associated with a Matrix class inheriting from a Table class vs a Matrix class doing everything in the first placeli liIs there a cost associated with having 3 instance of a Transform Object in a Node class vs exposing the underlying datatypes via member variables I realize that in both cases, it is composition, just that in one case, there a codewrappercode for transformations while in the other case, the transformations are exposed directly. I guess the question can be rephrased to codeDoes a wrapper have a cost considering it is an object that needs to be created and destroyedcodeli liLets assume that I am writing an application where every calculation even a simple Vector addition counts.

Negative 15475 pI created an applet that requires a CSV file for information.  The way the applet works, is that there is a text field in which you type in your zip code, then you press a button.

The problem is when I put in on the web, it displays but cant do anything, meaning it is just an applet with a text field and a button, but when you press the button, nothing happens. I know that it is not my codeActionListenercode, because it works on the desktop, but I must be doing something wrong with the HTML of it. The name of the CSV file is codezips.csvcode.

Negative 15475 pIve recently been slated with a task to port an existing Flash Playerbase game to a desktop app for publication on the Steam platform. The Adobe AIR framework seems like a logical choice for distribution, especially given the latest updates in AIR 3. Given the fact that Im relatively new to flashflex development, Ive read through a fair amount of AIR documentation on the Adobe site in order to gain a better understanding of what the task involves. In general, I think I have a decent idea of what needs to happen, but there are a couple of wrinkles that may affect ifhow it is even possible to port to the AIR frameworkp  ol liThe AIR application will need to load the actual game client from an external server due to the quick turnaround time of the client development.li liSince the AIR application will be deployed on Steam, I want to use the Captive Runtime bundling thats available in AIR 3.0, i.e. no need for the user to OK a separate AIR installation.li liHave minimal impact on code changes within the external SWF as Im not the primary developer of the game. li ol  pMy first priority is to figure out the best approach for loading an external game client SWF into an AIR application. Initially, I tried to utilize Loader.load, but that resulted in the following exceptionp  precodeSecurityError Error 2070 Security sandbox violation caller httplocalhostMyClient.swf cannot access Stage owned by appAS3AIRTest.swf.     at flash.mediaSoundMixerset soundTransform     at com.company.client.soundSFXManagerload     at globalclient.utilloadEmbeddedSounds     at MyClient codepre  pThe offending code isp  precodestatic public function loadvoid      SoundMixer.soundTransform           new SoundTransformClient.Settings.PlaySFX  1  0  codepre  pUpon hitting this exception, I decided to read up a bit more on the AIR  Flash player security domains. I have a much clearer understanding of why the exception occurred, but Im still uncertain what the best approach would be to load the SWF and not receive the exception above.p  pAfter scouring through numerous posts on various forums, I found that a number of developers use Loader.loadBytes to bring the SWF into the application sandbox. From an ease of implementation standpoint, I can see why many choose to go that route however, Im not inclined to pursue that approach due the potential dangers to user systems in the event that the external server is compromised.p  pThe second approach that Ive read about is that I can utilize a sandbox script bridge, and write an interface to grant certain privileges to the external client SWF. Im hesitant to go this route at the moment because the game client is fairly complex, and Im not entirely certain how much access it will require of the stage via different flash APIs. I havent written this approach off as it sounds like it may be the best bet, but it could potentially be a large endeavor and I want to have minimal impact on the client SWF.p  pThe final approach Ive read about is by making an HTML AIR application. My understanding sketchy at best is that a SWF loaded via HTML I believe in a frameiframe will have its own stage. My line of thinking is that if the HTML app loads a main page, which in turn has an iframe with SWF embed of the game client, then the client SWF will load in a remote security sandbox and have access to its own stage. My hope is that the SWF would behave as it does in the Flash Player.p  pThis leads me to the following questionsp  ol liIs my line of thinking correct about the HTML app ul liWould the client SWF have access to its own stage and pretty much behave like it does in the Flash Playerli ulli liCan HTMLbased AIR applications be bundled with the captive runtimeli liCan I use a traditional flex application with HTMLLoader to accomplish the same goal or does it need to be a fullblown HTML app ul liIf HTMLLoader can be used, would I need to provide the sandbox script bridge meta tags in the iframe tagli ulli ol  pAny help would be very much appreciated at this point. It seems like there are a number of options available, but Im not sure which path is the right one to pursue at this point in time.p  pThank again.p  pJoshp

Negative 15475 pIm having a bit of an SQL headscratching moment and was wondering if anyone could help. Using this data for examplep  precodeworkId     rateRevision 1          1 1          2 1          3 2          1 3          1 3          2 4          1 4          2 4          3 codepre  p... I basically want to delete all duplicates except the latest revision highest rateRevision value. So I would end up withp  precodeworkId     rateRevision 1          3 2          1 3          2 4          3 codepre  pTheoretically it sounds really simple but I cant work it out in SQL. Heres my current codep  precodeSELECT  FROM rate r WHERE r.rateRevision   select r.rateRevision from rate r ORDER BY r.rateRevision DESC LIMIT 1 codepre  p...but that just returnsp  precodeworkId     rateRevision 4          3 codepre  pOf course, this is only selecting the values at the moment, but I was planning on essentially just reversing it for the delete statement. Does anyone have any ideas pleasep  pMany thanks Mattp
Negative 15475 pI am writing a stats reporting and I am working with a ton of data so we are only getting pieces. For instance we are outputting DateTimeData objects and tracking in interval of months from the start date to the end date.p  pThe problem is the data only puts out months that have data in there, for instance it would only give December 2010 February 2011 and August 2011. I need to know how I would construct it so I could put 0s where January 2011, March 2011, etc.. are. p  pCan someone give me an idea of how I would construct this without a lot of overhead I was thinking of first getting a loop, then getting the necessary interval e.g. Minutes, Months, Years and putting that into a list, then when I go through my DateTimeData objects checking if its greater than 0 replace that. Also this is for creating points on a chart.p
Negative 15475 pI am newbie in MATLAB, I want to verify the online back propagationBP code in C. I need to test the code whether it is exactly the same with the same network setting.

Negative 15475 pI am currently trying to roll my own CSS style switcher for my basic intranet.p  pIts not hugely important, but I know a couple of employees have slightly poor eyesight and thought a high contrast style may be of some use.p  pHere is my ideal set up, and the way I have tried to implement so far.p  pBasically I already have a mysql database that house user log on details, and other minor preferences regarding the site. I would like to have an extra column for the style preference, and have a simple page in the user area where the user can preview, select and apply the style.p  pIt would obviously be good if when the user selects the style initially, it applies it to the page so that it can be seen in action, and then can be confirmed if it is what the user chooses.p  pWhat I have attempted so farp  pBasically, when the user logged on, it created a session variable which contains the value of the style column for that user. I went with numbers for the test, with a choice of 3 styles, 1, 2 and 3. Then in the head section of the page, for the href of the stylesheet, I added some PHP that evaluated the session variable and echoed a stylesheet based on what was set. p  pThat worked fine, the stylesheet was different depending on what was in the mysql table for the style column. On the user preferences page is where I fell apart a bit. I created a small form with 3 radio select buttons, one for each style. The only way I could see to go from here, was for the form to post to a PHP file that updates the table based on selection.p  pThe main problem I have doing it in this manner is that the user has to log out and back in for the changes to take effect. I would like a setup where the change happens on the spot or on a refresh.p  pI could go with cookies, but would rather avoid if possible. Dont know if anyone has any suggestions to help me along or if there are any pre written scripts that could accomplish thisp  pMany thanksp  pEdsp

Negative 15475 pIve got a ViewModel that takes some Model data and slightly alters it.p  pThe way Im doing it works since I just pass the codeDomainModelcode to the constructor for the codeViewModelcode, but since Im using AutoMapper on some of my onetoone ViewModels, I thought Id try and learn how to do the mapping across all ViewModels.p  pHeres an example of a ViewModel that does a little extra.p  precodepublic class UsersDetailsViewModel      public string UserName  get set      public string Email  get set      public string Website  get set      public int ID  get set      public ListltOpenIDgt OpenIds  get set      public string UserAge  get set      public string About  get set      public string Slug  get set      public System.DateTime LastSeen  get set      public string Region  get set      public string MemberSince  get set      public string Reputation  get set      public bool IsUserMatch  get set       private readonly MarkdownDeep.Markdown markdown       public UsersDetailsViewModelDomain.User user              AuthUserData currentuser  AuthenticationHelper.RetrieveAuthUser         markdown.NoFollowLinks  true         markdown.SafeMode  true         markdown.ExtraMode  false         markdown.MarkdownInHtml  true           We want to ensure that the user has a username, even if they          havent set one yet. What this does is check to see if the          user.UserName field is blank, and if it is, it will set the          username to UserNNNN where NNNN is the user ID number.         UserName  user.UserName  null  user.UserName  User  user.ID.ToString           Nothing fancy going on here, were just repassing the object from          the database to the View.

At the same time, we transform the Markdown          into valid HTML. The raw input is stored without sanitization in          the database.  this could mean Javascript injection, etc, so the          output ALWAYS needs to be sanitized.

Specifically, using an attribute selector on an codehrefcode, Sizzle will use the actual attribute valuep  precode Will not find lta hrefindex.htmlgt... a[hrefhttpwww.example.comindex.html] codepre  pSizzle uses a hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenDOMelement.getAttribute relnofollowcode.getAttributecodea instead of a hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenDOMHTMLAnchorElement relnofollowcodeelem.hrefcodea or more precisely, codeelem[href]code, as a hrefhttpsgithub.comjquerysizzleblobmastersizzle.jsL854 relnofollowSizzle does in most casesa codeelem.hrefcode would provide the fullyqualified URL.p  pTo understand this a bit more, I created a fiddle to a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netRLLZZ relnofollowtry different forms of URLsa. In the process of testing, I discovered the obvious solution of a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netXax3W relnofollowsetting the codehrefcode equal to itselfap  precodea.eachfunction     this.href  this.href  codepre  pWhich, unsurprisingly, updates the element to reflect the fullyqualified URL that codethis.hrefcode provides.

In some cases, there is a piece of critical information missing from the search results. When this happens, the JavaScript on the page pops up the message when the page loads, letting the user know that info is missing. With the automation the code haltswaits for the box to clear before continuing, and the user must click on the OK button before this will happen.p  pI have no way to change the source script of the page directly, as that is outside of my scope of responsibility here at work.

Negative 15475 pIn ASP.net MVC4 theres this new concept of a web API for exposing CRUD functionality on your data model. The base class for these controllers is codeDataControllercode which derives from from codeApiControllercode. p  pUnfortunately this codeApiControllercode doesnt derive from codeIControllercode which is problematic since these requests cant be handled through your normal custom controller factory as these are supposed to return an instance of codeIControllercode.p  pDoes anyone know the reason behind this as I cant see why you would have a controller in your MVC project that doesnt derive from codeIControllercode as this breaks your custom controller factory as its not able to instantiate every single controller in your project.p  pIn short, because of this inheritance youre unable to use your DI container to inject dependencies.p
Negative 15475 pI created a data model in Xcode with about 9 entities, all of which are connected via relationships to a single core entity.p  pOnce I set this data model up graphically using the Graph Editor Style for the xcdatamodelId, I generated the class files by going to Editor  Create NSManagedObject Subclass.

We had to implement the school roles part of the form in a rather hackish way. We have the form implemented like this  notice how we hacked together school.id.tosrole.id.tos into the same checkbox on school roles.p  pIn the Admins controllers update function we manually destroy all schooladmin roles on each update then loop through the school roles params do a split on the ids on  then manually recreate each school based role.

Negative 15475 pAlright, so I have a simple understanding of how this sample app should work. I have a MySQL DB a php script on my server and some code in my Android application. From the information Ive gathered from StackOverflow and other sources, it seems like the best way to get data from my DB is to send my PHP script some parameters from my appof what data I want, and then relay that information back to the app.p  pAs of right now, my android app is just using a httppost method to connect to a URI of the php page. It is simply reading the webpage of plaintext and spitting it back onto the screen. My question is, how do I go about sending some kind of formatted output back to my application so that I can sort it, and put different parts of the response into different parts of my app.p  pstrongExamplestrongp  pDBp  pMenu ID Dinner  Desertp  precode 1  Chicken Jello   2  Steak   Fruit   3  Ham     Cake   codepre  pPHP Take parameter httpwebsite.comscript.phpparam1 Look it up in DB and echo that row.p  pAndroid Send httppost to URI Take the input and show it on the screenp  pSo what is the best way that I could seperate the incoming datap  pExample This is from Menu 1 You dinner will be Chicken Your desert will be Jellop  pBasically how can I parse the data I feel like there should be a standard way but Im just not sure about it yetp

Negative 15475 pI would like to remove the initial space in a textarea.

Negative 15475 pHi all I have a bioinformatics problem I could do with help on. Its quite long but Ill try break it down into smaller sections any help is wonderful.p  pI have a sequence of RNA length n made up of 4 letters A,U,C,G that is imported as a string into Python, that can fold to make a loop. A loop is made by matching pairs of letters from the sequence so that A is with U, C is with G and G is with U so that the string folds back on itself. p  pThe catch is that there must be three or more letters next to each other which form a pair, more than or equal to 3 letters forming a pair in a row and that there must be a gap between the sections of at least 3 letters as well.p  pI tried to post a picture but i dont have enough reputation points p  pIn the journal Im referencing  the author talks about a nested loop method to find all possible combinations where this is possible and then containing them in a group to be called upon later.p  pMy problem is writing the nested loops as Im new to programming and python. As well as storing the sequences in a way where it is possible to identify the pairs and possibly add them together.p  pAgain any help would be great and if anything is unclear please let me knowp  peditp  pan example would be seqaggcuugaguuu where one of the outputs showed the pairing of seq[02] with seq[911] meaning the code forms like a Ushape. p  pIf you imagine the string as a physical piece of string and hold it at 3 points and hold it at three different points and then touched the points together it would cause the string to form a loop. Im looking to identify the 6 points used.p  pIm not looking for code to be written for me Id just like to know a method for composing the code. p  pI tried a method where seq1input code and seq2reverse input code and moved seq2 along seq1 looking for three neighbouring pairs but this didnt give me the correct output.p

Negative 15475 pI got this bug that began to occur in Chrome 17 and stayed with 18, when rendering an ASP.NET site.  p  pWhats going on is one of the pages renders incorrectly, BUT if I click on the webpage, or even on the scrollbar or on an html element in the chrome dev tools, then the components from the website snap back to their correct positions.  It is quite a complex website with lots of controls, and what happens visually is that some panels appear blank, some popups are shown, and some hidden controls are visible.  p  pThis isnt happening in any other browser or version, and never occurs the first time I enter the page.  It only occurs after a postback has happened from within the same page.  p  pIve noticed some CSS rules are set on the misbehaved components, but are not being visually applied.  For example, Im using chromes console to inspect a custom dropdown menu which should be hidden.  When I retrieve the item, it has both the displaynone and visibilityhidden properties, e.g.p  precodeltul idxx styleposition absolute left 90px top 845px display none visibility hiddengt ... ltulgt codepre  pHowever, when retrieving its display css property, its block.p  precodexx.cssdisplay block codepre  pOnce I perform an action inside the webpage, the components snap to their correct layout, and the display property is suddenly the correct none.p  pIm really out of ideas with this one.  There doesnt seem to be any code executed between the incorrect and correct rendering of the page.  My guess is maybe there are CSS conflicts between the asp code and the .css files, and maybe one is overwriting the other before it finished rendering.p  pAny help is greatly appreciated.  Thanks.p

Negative 15475 pNormally i try to structure my dao classes in such a way that they are completely dependant on themselves. They can interact with multiple tables but only if the data relates to the base object. For example say i have an appointment object, and the appointment dao pulls data from an appointments table. Lets say one column if the appointments table is a service id which is a foreign key that binds an appointment to a service. The services table is completely independant of the appointments and has its own dao where the user can add or remove services.p  pThe appointment object has a service field which is meant to store a service object. I do this because in many circumstances in the view its necessary to reference this service object when dealing with the appointment.p  pIn the appointment dao i could write separate sql statements to pull the service data from its table and remap all of this in the appointment dao, but all of this is already being done in the service dao and would be as simple as calling serviceDao.findserviceId. I feel a little dirty referencing the service dao inside my appointment dao. Is this because ive got design problems or is it ok to do this sort of thing Ive tried researching this problem and the results are 5050.p

Negative 15475 pIm currently using a template to generate Excels to export data from my DB to daily reports using SSIS.p  pThis template is a workbook of about 5 worksheets, of which only 1 needs to be filled automatically. This sheet has about 20 columns, of which 2 use Vlookups to autopopulate values based on the value in the preceding column. This is like an IDName pair.

This IDName relation is maintained in Sheet 2, which I am not touching.p  pMy problem is THIS  The formula is applied to these two columns for about 150 rows i dont expect more records. So, if my DB returns 120 results, I want my final Excel report from SSIS to have records from A2 to T122.

These formulabased Name columns have values NA when the ID column is empty.p  pHow do I tackle this Would I be able to work around this if I redesigned the Excel formulae to store an empty string instead of NA when no ID value is present My enduser needs these formulae to be preserved in his final Excel output.p

Negative 15475 pI want to implement emails blacklist for my system.

Making query each time to DB to search particular key like, codeSELECT 1 FROM table WHERE emailcheckingemailcode. And of course that table will have only one field codeemailcode and that field will be indexedunique. And I will use only strict comparision. 2. or cache that table content in ONE array and making query to array to check is particular elementkey exist or not p  pIn case when bad email list could be as long as much, for example 10 million records.p  pWhat will be faster  and better for high loading project p  pP.S. I know that PHP arrays eat too much memory, But doing a lot of DB queries in case when newsletter sending is started is also not so good.p  pP.P.S. Im going to cache bad emails in one variable this is why in PHP it will be present as array.p  pP.P.S. Another approach is caching each bad email in each cache key and checking only if such key exist in cache or not, but in that case purging the cache will be more complicated. Im thinking this is the best solution. Keys in cache can be like, bademail. And logic of that pre sending call could be check if required email exist in cache, if not exist, then check in DB if it is not present and there too, then it is good email. From other point if system detect bad email then it will be saved in DB and in Cache in the same time.p

Negative 15475 pEssentially, what Im doing is writing my login and authentication routines for the CMS Im developing. Id like to incorporate the ability for a user to log in using Facebook or Twitter instead of having to type in their username and passwords. Part of the feature is the site owner would be able to turn this feature on and off, depending on their security preferences for managing their site.p  pIve got the app set up in Facebook and Twitter, though what Im running into is that the request will only ever be bounced back to one URL, even though Im intending that the CMS be downloaded and installed on separate domains and run independently from one another.p  pIve tried setting up a simple service that my CMS can dial home to which is where the responses have to be funneled to due to Facebook and Twitter policy. Idealistically, my service would retrieve the users facebook or twitter ID, and output the response data as an XML feed so that my CMS could parse the response and log them in accordingly. The part that Im snagged on is the feed will prompt the user to login every time, so it seems like the permissions are not where they need to be, or the data just isnt crossing the domains appropriately.p  pWhat am I missing herep

Negative 15475 pIve been doing a little experimenting building a mobile application to use with phone gap. When defining the layout although I have some questionsp  pI want to build a single page layout with side scrolling, using the same effect as a carousel image gallery, but instead of switching images I want to switch between pages.p  pI want to achieve a carousel like effect switching pages and was thinking about using something like Bootstrap or a hrefhttpink.sapo.pt relnofollowInka and use the provided layout so that I can have each column to behave as a different screen. Something like what is explained here img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comPn8L7.jpg altenter image description here where the red square represent the currently visualized screen or column and the blue squares are the screens invisible or columns. So, as you can see each column should scale to fill the screenviewport.p  pReading the documentation from both the frameworks Im not seeing how I can achieve this since the column definition isp  blockquote   pThe default Bootstrap grid system utilizes 12 columns, making for a   940px wide container without responsive features enabled. With the   responsive CSS file added, the grid adapts to be 724px and 1170px wide   depending on your viewport. Below 767px viewports, the columns become   fluid and stack vertically.p blockquote  pfor bootstrap and p  blockquote   pWith Ink, you are given three layouts you can use to your hearts   content.p      pS which stands for small M which stands for medium L which stands for   large By default these correspond to the following screen size   intervals well show how you can customize these in just a secondp      pSmall below 650 PIXELS WIDE Medium between 651 and 960 pixels wide   Large above 961 pixels widep blockquote  pfor Ink.p  pSo, from what I could understand I cant quite achieve the intended effect.p  pMy question is How can I get the effect wanted and how can I make bootstrap or Ink change its column definition so that each column will represent a screen or a set of columns since the sum of them all must be 12 columns Is this even possible Are there any other alternatives I should considerp  pBest Regards, Celso Santosp

Negative 15475 pWe host multiple SQL Server 2008 databases provided by another group. Every so often, they provide a backup of a new version of one of the databases, and we run through a routine of deleting the old one, restoring the new one, and then going into the newly restored database and adding an existing SQL login as a user in that database and assigning it a standard role that exists in all of these databases.p  pThe routine is the same, except that each database has a different name and different logical and OS names for its data and log files. My inclination was to set up an auxiliary database with a table defining the set of names associated with each database, and then create a stored procedure accepting the name of the database to be replaced and the name of the backup file as parameters. The SP would look up the associated logical and OS file names and then do the work.p  pThis would require building the commands as strings and then execing them, which is fine. However, the stored procedure, after restoring a database, would then have to USE it before it would be able to add the SQL login to the database as a user and assign it to the database role. A stored procedure cant do this.p  pWhat alternative is there for creating an automated procedure with the pieces filled in dynamically and that can operate crossdatabase like thisp

Negative 15475 pIn a produce we are creating there is a piece of functionality which doesnt function perfectly in Chrome unless you are at 100 zoom.  Chrome is not a major target for our product, we expect less than 5 of our users to use it, so we cant allocate a significant number of hours to fixing this feature for zoomed Chrome which we expect to be a very low percentage of Cusers users.p  pThe functionality is a scrolling widget that shows them a limited view of a list of items at a time.  In FF, IE, and 100 zoomed Chrome it scrolls one item per click of the left or right arrows.  In Chrome that is not 100 zoomed, it scrolls .5 to 1.5 items per click.p  pWeve also found some minor graphical glitches in Chrome at a zoom level different than 100.p  pIn our testing, we found that Chrome would sometimes change zoom level when entering our site, seemingly automatically.  We would ensure the zoom was 100 before going to our test site, but as soon as we hit our test site, zoom changed to 90.p  pstrongIs there a way to programmatically force Chrome to 100 zoomstrongp

Negative 15475 pI am making an android application where I would like to use a few things that are in GNU Octave or Scipy.  The specific things I want to use are strongfsolvestrong and strongfzerostrong.  fsolve finds a root zero of a system of nonlinear equations.  fzero finds the root of a nonlinear function.  These are two really useful optimization functions for me, but I am having a hard time finding an alternative for android.

Negative 15475 pI have polymorphic objects in a project. I also have a webservice that requires objects in JSON. I wish to store the objects to be sent in a Map to have them later serialized with Jackson. The only common ancestor of these objects is the java Object.

Pretty simple, but as a hrefhttpwiki.fasterxml.comJacksonPolymorphicDeserialization relnofollowthe jackson wikia points out, type information is lost due to java typeerasure. p  pMy idea is then to preserialize actual objects in the collection when their actual type is known, and store it some way in the collection to have the entire collection serialized later, using these preserialized strings. Is this somehow possible Or is there any workaround that doesnt require the actual types to be known at serializationp

The click event will open the dialog box, and upon return the file name without the path will be available as a file.val. See a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq8974633341971thisa question, as well as the sample on a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netA4BS71 relnofollowjsfiddlea.li liIm also aware HTML5 has a codemultiplemultiplecode attribute now, which will let the user select multiple files.li liHowever, Im looking for a multiple file solution, which will work on IE8 and above as well as WebKit, Mozila.li liSome people suggested Google is using Flash.

There are 24 input elements, 19 of which are typehidden, none is typefile.p  pbEDIT 2bThank you all responders and commentators. Indeed  the there is no other way argument in comment below was valid. As it turns out, both Outlook.NET and GMail will have a codeltinput typefilegtcode element, which they will add dynamically, only when the user clicks the Attach a file button. Then, they will send a click event to the element, which will trigger the select file dialog.p  pThe witness this, use the F12 development tool either in Chrome, or in IE, and in the interactive console type document.querySelectorAllinput[typefile]. Note that in both implementations, the element is a direct child of body with displaynone.p  pThey do bnotb use iframe for the upload unlike the only answer below, but simple XHR code to upload, which is now, in HTML5 is available.p  pThe best resource on the Web for how to do it is a hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenUSdocsUsingfilesfromwebapplications relnofollowhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenUSdocsUsingfilesfromwebapplicationsa.

For examplep  precodeclass Controller lt ApplicationController   require openuri    def action     openhttpwww.google.com     openhttpwww.yahoo.com   end end codepre  pwhere doing that would open both google.com and yahoo.com.p

How can I call a PreferenceFragment class within a Fragment class Its important because I use a sliding menu that is based on fragments, thus I cannot call the PreferenceFragment from anywhere else besides within Fragmentp

Negative 15475 pI have a JEditoPane inside a JScrollPane.  I have some text content that contain some predefined tokens. Im storing the location of these tokens in the database. When I set the text content into the JEditorPane, I embed the tokens with HTML.  I also add HTML break lines to format the content.p  pNow problem comes when I want to scroll to one of the highlighted tokens.  It seems that  the start position of the tokens, which I stored in database,  do not match when using the setCaretPositionint.  I know its probably because my content in JEditorPane Document is mixed with HTML.p  pSo is there a way to search for a String in the JEditorPane content, then somehow get the caret position where the string was foundp

Negative 15475 pSince the awesome code1.0.0code release Ive been playing around with codeiPythoncode parallel interface.

Negative 15475 pOk, Im making a physics game with Corona SDK. To fire a ball, you pull back and release, the linear impulse is based on that distance. The ball is a sprite with 2 frames, so you can change the color of the ball.

Also, the linear impulse applied is much greater than it should be. If I change the frame back it doesnt fix anything. Any thoughts on what this could be Thanksp

Negative 15475 pIm trying to make web app that can dynamically load in different motion jpeg video streams into canvas and do something like codegetImageDatacode.

Negative 15475 pGood day,p  pI was playing around with SVG, when I noticed this behaviour.p  pBackground I was loading the SVG using snap.svg. The node I wanted to replace was inside a group ltggt node.p  pI selected an SVG node using document.getElementById. Then I got the parent. Then I replaced the textContent property of the parent with another set of SVG text. However, the new SVG was not visible.p  pI opened the developer tools in google chrome. I selected the same node in the node tree view. I edited the node as HTML, replacing all SVG nodes with the new SVG text. However, the new SVG was not visible.p  pLastly, I selected the root element, the SVG tag itself. Then edited the SVG tag as HTML, appending the SVG text as the last child element. Now the new SVG was visiblep  pAre there SVG drawing rules that I should be aware of Ive read in other questions that its hardimpossible to replace SVG text the save way HTML can be replaced by using node.innerHTML.p

Negative 15475 pIm a newbie to JPA and Hibernate. I was able to set up some small basic examples as expected.  Now Im trying to use it for a first real world project.  Studying the Hibernate best practices I found that you should avoid manytomany relationships. I found relating questions here and I do understand the concept why not to use it but Im not understanding how it should be implemented.p  pSo when I have the often used example of a user that can the part of many groups and a group that does have many users, how to implement that. So this is a manytomany relationship. But I should not use manytomany, as far as I understood because it is very likely that I will need other information in the future, like a specific role a user has in a group or a date when he joined. So I use a two onetomany relationships and a joining table which doesnt only contains the ids but also will contain additional information like role or date. Is that right And then neither the  class group has a property users  nor  the class users has a property groups both have a property joinTableEntriesp  pDid I get the concept right so farp  precodeEntity Tablenameuser public class User         private int userId     private String username     private SetltJTUserGroupgt jtUserGroupSetnew HashSetltJTUserGroupgt0       Id     GeneratedValuestrategy  GenerationType.IDENTITY     Columnname  userid     public int getUserId              return this.userId          public void setUserIdint userId          this.userId  userId           public String getUsername          return username           public void setUsernameString username          this.username  username           OneToManyfetch  FetchType.LAZY, mappedBy  user     public SetltJTUserGroupgt getJtUserGroupSet          return jtUserGroupSet            public void setJtUserGroupSetSetltJTUserGroupgt jtUserGroupSet          this.jtUserGroupSet  jtUserGroupSet        Entity Tablename  forumgroup public class Group       private int groupId     private String groupname     private SetltJTUserGroupgt jtUserGroupSetnew HashSetltJTUserGroupgt0      Id     GeneratedValuestrategy  GenerationType.IDENTITY     Columnname  groupid     public int getGroupId          return groupId           public void setGroupIdint groupId          this.groupId  groupId           public String getGroupname          return groupname           public void setGroupnameString groupname          this.groupname  groupname           OneToManyfetch  FetchType.LAZY, mappedBy  group     public SetltJTUserGroupgt getJtUserGroupSet          return jtUserGroupSet           public void setJtUserGroupSetSetltJTUserGroupgt jtUserGroupSet          this.jtUserGroupSet  jtUserGroupSet          Entity Tablename  jtusergroup public class JTUserGroup      private int joinId     private User user     private Group groupenter code here      Id     GeneratedValuestrategy  GenerationType.IDENTITY     public int getJoinId          return joinId           public void setJoinIdint joinId          this.joinId  joinId            ManyToOnefetch  FetchType.LAZY, cascade  CascadeType.ALL     JoinColumnname  userid, nullable  false     public User getUser          return user           public void setUserUser user          this.user  user           ManyToOnefetch  FetchType.LAZY, cascade  CascadeType.ALL     JoinColumnname  groupid, nullable  false     public Group getGroup          return group           public void setGroupGroup group          this.group  group        codepre  pand then to use these I add a new user to a group like thisp  precodeUser user1new User         User user2new User         User user3new User         Group group1new Group         Group group2new Group           user1.setUsernameMark         user2.setUsernameAnton         user3.setUsernameMaggy         group1.setGroupnameMarkMaggy         group2.setGroupnameMaggyAnton          JTUserGroup jt1new JTUserGroup         jt1.setGroupgroup1         jt1.setUseruser1           JTUserGroup jt2new JTUserGroup         jt2.setGroupgroup1         jt2.setUseruser3           JTUserGroup jt3new JTUserGroup         jt3.setGroupgroup2         jt3.setUseruser3           JTUserGroup jt4new JTUserGroup         jt4.setGroupgroup2         jt4.setUseruser2           GenericDAOltJTUserGroupgt jtDaonew GenericDAOltJTUserGroupgt          jtDao.beginTransaction         jtDao.insertjt1         jtDao.insertjt2         jtDao.insertjt3         jtDao.insertjt4         jtDao.commit codepre

I can also use isinstance to verify that codeacode is a numpy arrayp  pcodegtgtgt isinstancea, np.ndarray Truecodep  pSide question how would I return an easily interpretable object to figure out what codeacode is The documentation says type returns the type of an object, but what kind of thing is a type of an object Its not a string, or a number. Its some sort of object. I seem to be able to convert the type object to a string and then parse it with split for example, but this seems dangerous. Is there sufficient documentation on the objects of type type that I could guarantee that when I pass it to str I get something I can parse in a standard wayp  pBack to the main question.p  pI now use the argmin method on ap  pcodegtgtgt f  a.argmincodep  pI expected that the type of f is an integer, but its not. For examplep  pcodegtgtgt type3 int code gives int. But type f givesp  pcodegtgtgt typef numpy.int32codep  pI dont know what the answer numpy.int32 is telling me. Its not a numpy arrayp  pcodegtgtgt isinstancef, np.ndarray Falsecodep  pBut f is also not an integer. What is it This is relevant, because I passed this numpy.int32 object to a function, and it created a mess. When I first convert to int, and then pass it to the function, everything worked fine. Clearly, the function wanted an int, but I passed it a numpy.int32 instead and got bad results. p  pThe doc string for the argmin method says it returns indices. I am not sure what is. I assumed it would be an integer, or a numpy array of integers. But indices is neither. Its this numpy.int32 thing. What is that p  pThanks for your help.p  pSide discussion continued I still seek a numpy function or method that returns the type of an object in some easilyinterpretable form. type returns an object of type type, but I dont know how to write a program that queries type objects. I dont really know what a type object is or how to interact with it. It would be great to have a numpy function that returns something simple, and tells me this is a numpy array of floats or this is a scalar float or this is a numpy.int32 whatever that is. I have yet to find a way to do this. p

Negative 15475 pThe question is directed at people who have thought about code style in the context of the upcoming ECMAScript 6 Harmony and who have already worked with the language.p  pWith code gt code and codefunction  code we are getting two very similar ways to write functions in ES6. In other languages lambda functions often distinguish themselves by being anonymous, but in ECMAScript any function can be anonymous. Each of the two types have unique usage domains namely when codethiscode needs to either be bound explicitly or explicitly not be bound. Between those domains there is a vast number of cases where either notation will do.p  pArrow functions in ES6 have at least two limitationsp  ul liDont work with codenewcodeli liFixed codethiscode bound to scope at initialisationli ul  pThese two limitations aside, arrow functions could theoretically replace regular functions almost anywhere. What is the right approach using them in practice Should arrow functions be used e.g.p  ul lieverywhere they work, i.e. everywhere a function does not have to be agnostic about the codethiscode variable and we are not creating an object.li lionly everywhere they are needed, i.e. event listeners, timeouts, that need to be bound to a certain scopeli liwith short functions but not with long functionsli lionly with functions that do not contain another arrow functionli ul  pWhat I am looking for is a guideline to selecting the appropriate function notation in the future version of ECMAScript. The guideline will need to be clear, so that it can be taught to developers in a team, and to be consistent so that it does not require constant refactoring back and forth from one function notation to another.p

Negative 15475 pI have a large number of stored procedures 200 that all collect clinical data and insert the result into a common table. Each stored procedure accepts the same single parameter, codeClientIDcode, and then compiles a list of diagnostic results and inserts them into a master table. p  pI have each clinical test separated into individual stored procedures however as I described in a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions23062561sqlserverstoredproceduresslowvsgiantscriptprevious SO questiona, the execution of the batch of these stored procedures pegs the CPU at 100 and continues on for hours before eventually failing. This leads me to want to create a single script that contains all the functionality of the stored procedures. Why you ask Well, because it works. I would prefer to keep the logic in the stored procedure but until I can figure out why the stored procedures are so slow, and failing, I need to proceed with the script method.p  pSo, what I am looking to do is to take all the stored procedures and find a way to script their functionality out to a single SQL script. I can use the Tasks  Generate Scripts wizard but the result contains all the codeCreate Procedurecode and codeBegincode and codeEndcode functionality that I dont need.p

When codecurrentActivity  actcode is true, then codeactivecode holds the string value codetruecode and not the boolean codetruecode, or else, codefalsecode and not codefalsecode.p  pThis means that although it conceptually is a boolean, I must treat it as a string. For instance, Id like to write codengclassactivityActive activecode instead codengclassactivityActive active  truecode. Right now, if I forget the extra part, this always evaluate to true, as both codefalsecode and codetruecode are truthy.p  pIs there any way for me to obtain nonstring attributes like this Whats the best way to achieve thisp

Negative 15475 pI have a pythonflask application. In it I have a page which queries the database a lot in order to display the data on the page. However, if I include this logic in the view.py where the app.route is, then loading the page takes too long. Im then displaying this data with d3.p  pMy current setup is that I have a separate route from the view which calculates the data lets say data is the path. When you go to that path, it returns the data in a json format and is loaded by p  precoded3.jsondata, callback codepre  pThis works fine. My issue is that there are a lot of different queries I need to complete, and having a different path for each dataset is cluttering up my app and doesnt seem to be following the DRY principle. Is there a better way to do this Im also having difficulties passing variables to the javascript that runs the d3 from python.p

Negative 15475 pIm still fairly new to Access, so I apologize if this is pretty basic stuff.  I have a database with a table that contains the information of different companies and their products.  The user can enter multiple products in the Product field based on a dropdown, check box list.  For example, I could have the name of a company in the Company Name field, and then it could have up to four products that it produces Toys, Household Appliances, Furniture, Cleaning Supplies in the Products field.p  pI have created a report to generate a list of the companies by product.  The user opens a form where they can select one of the products in a dropdown list and then hit go.  Ideally, the report generated contains all of the suppliers that produce that product.  However, my problem is that if a company produces multiple products, the filter doesnt include that company, since it doesnt match the specified criteria exactly.p  pBasically what Im looking for some way to tell the report to filter for all companies if it CONTAINS a specific product, not just equals that product.  Im not sure how to do this.  I hope that makes sense, any help would be appreciated p

The only way I know of specifying an instruction that is too long is by adding prefixes to the instruction. Lets say I do the followingp  precoderep O32 rep O32 rep O32 rep O32 rep O32 mov eax, [fs0] codepre  pIn this case, I should get a 16bytelong instruction, since codemov eax, [fs0]code is a 6bytelong instruction, plus the 10 codeO32code and coderepcode prefixes equal 16 bytes.p  pAt least thats the theory ... but when I compile this with NASM and disassemble the resulting binary, what I find is that the unnecessary prefixes got plucked from there only 1 coderepcode prefix stays and obviously the codefscode segment prefix. Thus, the total length of the instruction is reduced to just 7 bytes. I guess this is how it is supposed to work, but is there a way to make it so the instruction length actually grows beyond boundsp

Negative 15475 pIm developing a small website using PHP, and during my research i saw many projects which write codeobstartcode at the top of the page before the codeDOCTYPEcode just because they need to redirect the user midpage in case of an error without triggering the Headers already sent error.p  pNow im a bit confused because i never knew that codeobstartcode can be used that way i mean buffer an entire page, I always wrote my codes like thisp  precodeltphp      First Logic stuff and Validation with redirects on error       Last HTML markup or include header.php gt codepre  pAnd i never had problems with the headers.

Negative 15475 pI am writing shop system in CakePHP Framework. I am stuck on writing flexible discount system.p  pI have Product model that can have many different attributes ProductVariant Model and ProductAttribute model.p  pProductVariant is the part where there is price specified, because I can have physical product with different price and eproduct for download with different price though content is the same. So from this model for consideration is type and price.p  pProductAttributes are some properties of product  like category, language etc. attributes are defined in a keyvalue way and assigned to productp  pNow I want operators to be able to add temporary discounts, discount codes etc. That would apply discounts on product basis depending on its Variant andor Attributes.p  pFor instance  discount 20 for physical products in english language or 5 for download products in german or english language.p  pI figured out that maybe I should create Models  DiscountType for percentage discount and just plain discount  DiscountScope for discounting specific product ids andor attributes andor variantsp  pBut I am stuck here, wondering how to define those rule sets so the operator could add them easily attributes and variants can be added by operator too, so there is infinite number of possibilities here, but accessible from DB of course.p  pAnd second part where I am stuck is applying discounts for order processing. Should I use decorator pattern If so I am clueless now how to apply it in Cake or just in MVC.p  pIf I can improve my question somehow or provide some parts of code that can help solve the problem please let me know.p

Negative 15475 pFor my new application , I am planning to implement customized distribution over multiple mongo databases. Will that scale well with mongoengine using switchdb p  pI am using tornado server.p  pSome more information. p  pMy userids uid are generated so that they belong to a specific db among my db servers.p  pMessages between two users uid1 , uid2 ill take the minimum of uids and get the sever specific for that uid , and all these messages will go into that server. Not a good example , but forgetting the actual data distribution I want to know using switchdb function with a custom distribution in mongoengine vs mongodb default sharding in terms of scaling or any major drawbacks. I feel there will be greater control when done with my application. Any helpful thoughts appreciated.p  pSpecific reason as i assume for my wish to use application based sharding is my data is heavily tag oriented and practically no scans over the data.p

Negative 15475 pIm writing a quick n dirty image editor.  The user can load an image into pbOriginal, drag a cropping square in it, and have it displayed in pbAltered.

Kind of like a drag event, but Im not trying to drag anything in I just want to capture the enter with the mouse down.

Considering the nature of random IP address generation, chances are at least one out of 1000 hosts is going to be either invalid, or unreachable in some way. So what I need is a way to try emeveryem host in the array skipping any that throw errors.p

Negative 15475 pIm currently porting an ASP.NET 2.0 application to ApacheMono Ubuntu 13.10.p  pThe application uses XSLT to create ASP.NET controls from dynamic content. It does so by using the infamous Page.ParseControlstring method.p  pSome pages might have 500 dynamic controls. Calling ParseControl on them still used to take only a few milliseconds on IISWindows and is only done on initial pageload. For async. postbacks, only a small number of those controls is recreated like the one that was clicked to optimize that stuff.p  pNow to my problem with Mono ParseControl takes between 3001500 ms for EACH call. Passing those 500 controls in a loop would probably take forever, so I already optimized itp  ol liPut ALL controls in a wrapperDIVli liCall ParseControl on thatli liExtract all single elements via C codeli ol  pThis takes exactly the same time as parsing only 1. The cost of ParseControl seems to be calling it at all I guess. Also it is only that slow, if I pass new content to it so there seems to be some caching already.p  pParseControl creates files in tmp and then starts the ASP.NETcompiler on them as far as I can see. How could I speed this up The Monosources are full of TODOs refering to that functionallity and it no longer works at all with Ubuntu 14.04 throws System.Web.Compilation.CompilationException, see a hrefhttpmono.1490590.n4.nabble.comCS1576afterupgradetoUbuntu14041td4663599.html relnofollowhttpmono.1490590.n4.nabble.comCS1576afterupgradetoUbuntu14041td4663599.htmlap

Negative 15475 pI am working on a crossplatform game using CC and socket. I am using UDP broadcast e.g. send to xx.xx.xx.255 if on a Ctype LAN address for discovering of nearby players in LAN game playing. p  pThe issue is the MaciOS version can not receive broadcast UDP packet that sent by others neither from MaciOS , nor from windows, while windows version is able the receive broadcast packet from MaciOS. Thus MaciOS can not discover any nearby players while windows can discover all nearby players. On the same socket handle, sendingreceiving normal UDP packet works on all platforms sent to a specific address instead of the broadcast address. p  pEvery testing device has only one NIC, which is connected to a single WIFI router. Addresses are dynamically allocated by DHCP on the WIFI router. The socket is bind to exact local address instead of 0.0.0.0, and I am using port 19190.

Negative 15475 pI would like to evaluate formulas which a user can input for many data points, so efficiency is a concern.  This is for a Fortran project, but my solutions so far have been centered on using a yaccbison grammar, so I will probably use Fortrans isocbinding feature to interface to yyparse.p  pThe preferred so far solution would be an small extension of the classic codemfcalccode calculator example from the Bison manual, with the bison grammar made to recognize a single variable name as well which is not hard.p  pThe question is what to do in the executable statements.

Negative 15475 pI am trying to build a website and am running into a little trouble. My coding knowledge and savvy are armature at best,if you know a better way to do this than please by all means let me know. p  pOn my Featured Bar page I have two gridviews set up. gvPicsRandomBarFor pictures only and GVRandomBarsFor Information only. Each has their own SQLDataSource. I have it set up to where GVRandomBars selects a random bar through the SQL TOP command. What Im trying to do is get the gvPicsRandomBar to display a picture of the same random bar that is selected by GVRandomBars. Both gridviews are querying from the same table but with different SELECT statements as each gridview is concerned with different items in the same table row.p  pI thought I had somewhat accomplished this by reading the primary key from the GVRandomBars and placing that value in a LabellblRandomBar that I use as a control for gvPicsRandomBar to match up the correct pic to display in its own gridview as they both query the same database, but I was wrong. Whenever I startup my website I get this error Index was out of range. Must be nonnegative and less than the size of the collection. Parameter name index. Im just not sure where to place this code i.e. Event codelblRandomBar.Text  GVRandomBars.DataKeys0.Value.ToStringcode so that I will not get the above error.p  h2Seperate problems if by miracle I get it to workh2  pOne problem I have is that it appears that the value of the primary key is not passed on to lblRandomBar.text. I assume this is because I do not know where to correctly place the code codelblRandomBar.Text  GVRandomBars.DataKeys0.Value.ToStringcodeThe other problem I do have when I sometimes get it to work is that the picture displayed in gvPicsRandomBar is one step behind from when I click the search button. Example, I click search for city Austin in my dropdown list which could potentially give me a primary key value of 45. The picture for that primary key is not displayed until I click search for another city in the dropdown list and the page posts back to the server.p  pThe value of the primary key is in lblRandomBar.text for the current bar displayed in the GVRandomBars but the picture of the bar associated with that recored does not appear in the gvPicsRandomBar until the search button is clicked and another random bar is displayed in the GVRandomBars. So I am looking at a picture in gvPicsRandomBar from the last bar that was brought up in GVRandomBars while another bars information is currently displayed in GVRadnomBars.p  pI am looking to have the same bar information and bar picture in both gridviews at the same time, and not one step behind like I have currently with the picture in gvPicsRandomBar. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Negative 15475 pIm developing a JMeter script for an ajax dashboard. The user logs in, navigates to a repository, clicks on the dashboard link, waits for the dashboard to display, and then logs out. p  pThe dashboard has five dashlets. Ive come to a point in the script where there are five pairs of samplers, one for each dashlet. The first sampler in each pair has a POST REST request with with ajax in the body. There is a regular expression extractor that extracts an id from the body of the response. This id is added to the URL in the second sampler of the pair, which also has a POST REST request with ajax in the body.p  pWhen there are one or two pairs of these samplers the script works 100 of the time, executing the samplers returning HTTP 200 responses and correctly substituting the id extracted from the first sampler in each pair, then logging out in the final sampler exit.html. When the third pair of samplers are added I get the SocketException about once every 1015 executions.

Negative 15475 pI have run into an issue with a Python program that I am at a loss for how to debug. My program uses BeautifulSoup to parse page after page, and at some point it dies with exit code 139, without an error message even if run via the debugger. As far as I can tell 139 means segmentation fault, which does not give me much to go on. The issue is nondeterministic and does not happen quickly, so its hard to reproduce. Repeatedly handing BeautifulSoup the same HTML does not cause the issue, even if I use HTML that Ive seen cause the issue in the past. Is there anything I can do to debug the issuep  pIt is not the same issue as discussed in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13323469beautifulsoup4segmentationfaultcoredumpedbeautifulsoup 4 Segmentation fault core dumpeda.

Negative 15475 pI have recently enrolled in a course of microelectronics in my university, and I have bought a Zybo Zynq 7000 development board. I have already developed different applications in VHDL language. Now I want to use the USB and VGA connectors, so I would need to make them available from the hardware design point of view. I have been reading through a lot of tutorials about how to make these connectors external, but I have had any success so far. I know that these connectors are already connected to the internal ARM, but as I said, I am not able to make them external and use them with VHDL code. p  pIf I cannot do it by myself, I will have to manually connect an additional USB port to the digital PMOD connectors, but it would be very frustrating, since I want to learn to use the boards own connectors.p  pThank you for your help.p

Negative 15475 pSo, I recently took an interest in how well the compiler codegcc GCC 4.8.3code being the one in question is in optimizing pointers and pointers.p  pInitially I created a simple integer and an integer pointer and realized operations on it so I could print it out. As expected, all the operations that were hard coded were optmized, through dereferenced pointer or not.p  precodecall    main leaq    .LC0rip, rcx movl    1, edx call    printf codepre  pAnd even after creating a function that takes in an int pointer, dereferences it and changes it it still was perfectly optmized.p  precodecall    main leaq    .LC0rip, rcx movl    1, edx call    printf codepre  pNow, when I treated my pointer as a void and made changes by casting it to char and dereferencing it, it actually still optmized perfectly an extra mov call since I initially treated it as an 8 byte value, and then as a 1 byte value for pointer dereferencingp  precodecall    main movl    4, 44rsp movb    2, 44rsp leaq    .LC0rip, rcx movl    44rsp, eax leal    1rax, edx call    printf codepre  pSo onto my questionsp  ol lipHow consistent is compiler optimization regarding pointer dereferencing What would be some cases where it would chose to be conservative pli lipIf all of my pointers in a project were declared with the restrict keyword, could I trust it would be as well optimized as if no pointers were being used at allpli ol  passuming there are no codevolatilecode cases p  pPs.

Negative 15475 pIn my web application, I have coordinate bounds that Id like to modify to simulate zooming in on google maps.  It seems that zooming back and forth with google maps simply doubles or halves each side of the bounding box.  So my function to do this on the server looks like thisp  precodeprivate static decimal[] ZoomIndecimal latMax, decimal lngMin, decimal latMin, decimal lngMax      decimal lngAdjustment  lngMax  lngMin  .25m     decimal latAdjustment  latMax  latMin  .25m     return new[]               North         latMax  latAdjustment,          West         lngMin  lngAdjustment,          South         latMin  latAdjustment,          East         lngMax  lngAdjustment       codepre  pThe problem with this approach is the stronglatAdjustmentstrong that Im doing.  When compared to an actual zoom using the google maps control, this ends up being fairly accurate when zoomed in to city level.  However, it is less accurate the further the view is zoomed out.  I assume this is due to the Mercator projection of the earth that google maps uses.  Is anyone aware of a better formula or method to use to simulate a zoomp  pstrongUpdatestrong My issue has more to do with not knowing the correct formula than google maps.  Let me illustrate using some sample numbers.p  pTake Chicago, centered at 41.8563226156679,87.7339862646484p  pAnd a bounding box surrounding that pointp  ul liWest  87.984955197753800li liEast  87.483017331542900li liSouth 41.546931599561100li liNorth 42.164224124684300li ul  pBy observing the behavior of google maps, this bounding box zoomed in one level will be   West  87.859470731201100   East  87.608501798095600   South 41.701813184067600   North 42.010459667660800p  pcenter is kept the same, there is no variance due to mouse movement, etc.  I just used the manual zoom button, not the mousep  pUsing my formula above, longitude will values will come out correct.  Examplep  pwest  west  west  east  .25 87.984955197753800  87.483017331542900  87.984955197753800  .25  87.859470731201075p  pHowever, the same formula will not work when dealing with latitude.  It is near the correct values, but off by just enough that the map shifts noticeably.  This effect is worse with larger bounding boxes andor when the latitude is further from the equator. I assume this is due to the mercator projection of the earth.  Trig class was a long time ago for me, and at this point Im unable to find a suitable formula for zoom latitude for this situation.p

Negative 15475 pIm really wondering if this is possible.p  pRight now Im designing a new personal website for myself with HTML5CSS3, and I found some nice javascripts to execute on my site such as snowing effects and so forth. They work perfect on big size screens like my laptop, but on my mobile phone, they just go crazy.p  pIve been using media queries to make my website responsive and I thought like maybe I could stop these scripts from working on small sized screens with some sort of disable code or something in media queries. Im not obsessed with these scripts of course, but some of them are really nice and useful and Id be really glad if I could sort this problem out without losing them.p  pBy the way, Im also using Bootstrap so I need javascript running, so turning all the scripts off would be impossible for me. I just need to disable some specific ones.p  pId really appreciate your helps. Thank you allp

Negative 15475 pI have spent the entire day on this hobbyprogrammer, not a real one. I admit up front that the issue is my lack of understanding of the basic fundamentals of angular and most programming for that matter. I am especially new to web development and need some help.p  pAnyways, I have a template that Im using for learning purposes, thats all this is really. Its the anitheme from startangular.com. I built some basic logic to authenticate a user type aaa in the email lol, remember, its just for learning. This code works fine, and if aaa is entered then the router will be triggered to move you to the dashboard.p  pThe problem is that the user could just put the URL for the dashboard in the browser and go there. p  pI have a variable called authed that is set to true once they log in, but I cant seem to conditionally route the user to the dashboard when they type the URL in manually. I have tried so many things but no luck.p  pAfter 5 hours of research, i think it is due to the asynchronous nature of angular OR scope issues. Or both. Probably neither. idk.p  pI saw so many other posts about stateChangeStart but it went way over my head. Can someone point me in the right direction here or try to explain what is going on here in dummy terms. I mean it, I really dont know much so dumb it down, I wont be insulted.p  pstrongAPP.JSstrongp  precodevar authed  false var done  false var yapp  angular   .moduleyapp, [     ui.router,     ngAnimate,     myAuth   ]   .configfunctionstateProvider, urlRouterProvider          urlRouterProvider.whendashboard, dashboardoverview       urlRouterProvider.otherwiselogin      stateProvider       .statebase,          abstract true,         url ,         templateUrl viewsbase.html              .statelogin,          url login,         parent base,         templateUrl viewslogin.html,         controller LoginCtrl              .statedashboard,          url dashboard,         parent base,         templateUrl viewsdashboard.html,         controller DashboardCtrl              .stateoverview,          url overview,         parent dashboard,         templateUrl viewsdashboardoverview.html              .statereports,          url reports,         parent dashboard,         templateUrl viewsdashboardreports.html            codepre  pstrongLOGIN.JSstrongp  precodeangular.moduleyapp   .controllerLoginCtrl, functionscope, location, authFactory        scope.submit  functionemailp          ifauthFactory.checkAuthemailp            location.pathdashboard         else           alertWRONG                      codepre  pstrongAUTH.JSstrongp  precodevar myAuth  angular.modulemyAuth, []   .factoryauthFactory, function     var factory       factory.checkAuth  functionemailp       ifemailp  aaa authed  true       returnauthed          return factory    codepre  pstrongIMPORTANT SIDE NOTEstrongp  pI love advice and help, so please, if you see other things Im doing that just look ridiculous, please call me out.

Negative 15475 pI have created a List within SharePoint 2010 and would like certain fields to be prepopulated from an Access data source, when a field is populated in the SharePoint List.p  pFor example, I have two fields that can be populated in the list. One is the Country and the other is the City. In the Access database there is a list of data showing Cities available for each Country.p  pThe outcome would be when a user selects the country in the SharePoint list, the SharePoint list draws upon the Access database to return the options available to select for city.p  pIf anyone has any experience in this area or can refer me to a thread that already answers this, that would be much appreciated.p  pThanks,p

Negative 15475 pI updated to Xcode 7 from Xcode 6 and updated my code to swift 2.0 from swift 1.2. When I run the project, there are no compile time errors, just warnings, and the build is successful. The problem I am having is that the main.storyboard does not load. By this i mean all that is shown in the simulator is the launch page and the initial view controller is never put into the hierarchy i believe. When i updated my code to swift 2.0, i manually updated the AppDelegate which i did not expect and is why i think there may be something wrong with the file.

Negative 15475 pIm new in Swift and even in object oriented programming languages itself. So my question is, how to use this very extensive language Swift the right way I give an example to verify my problemp  pLets say I have got two classes p  ol lipClass ScanForBluetoth Handles all parts to scan for BT devicesp  precodeclass ScanForDevices UIViewController, CBCentralManagerDelegate , CBPeripheralDelegate, UITableViewDelegate,UITableViewDataSource codepreli lipClass Bluetooth Handles only the Bluetooth parts with its delegatesp  precodeclass Bluetooth ScanForDevices codepreli ol  pNow, I would like to implement all my used delegates and other Bluetooth specific functions into the Bluetooth class. BUT I need some objects for example of the CBCentralManagerDelegate in my ScanForDevices class, too. So, I have to implement all my delegates in my mother class ScanForDevices although I only need some properties. SO if I implement the delegates, I have to be conform with the protocol and must implement ALL my needed delegate functions... At the end I have implemented all my delegate functions in ScanForDevices and then override them in Bluetooth. But I dont think that my way is the best way to realize this problem...
