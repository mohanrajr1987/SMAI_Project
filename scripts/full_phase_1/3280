Positive 3280 pIm stumbling upon an issue on changing the locale during the login event on a symfony 2.7 application. I was following the sticky locale symfony article a hrefhttpsymfony.comdoccurrentcookbooksessionlocalestickysession.html relnofollowhttpsymfony.comdoccurrentcookbooksessionlocalestickysession.htmla, but not using the session at all.p  pIm using the approach that every URI contains one representation only. Therefore all routes contain the locale and no need of a session variable for sticky locales.p  pIm just using the UserLocaleListener part to get the users locale and tried to set it into the route like on this github issue a hrefhttpsgithub.comFriendsOfSymfonyFOSUserBundleissues829 relnofollowhttpsgithub.comFriendsOfSymfonyFOSUserBundleissues829a.p  pMy problem possibly is, that on login is already a URI locale set.

Positive 3280 pMy site is structured pretty typically, paths likep  precodehome homesearch categories categoriesmisc codepre  pWhat I need to happen is to have a dynamic set of prefixes put on the path and have it map to the same place, and more importantly, have that prefix kept throughout the site. The prefix wont always be there, but when its there, it needs to be kept.p  pFor example, I want codeclient1program1homecode to map to the same controller actionview as codehomecode, and if theres a link on codehomecode that references codeUrl.Contentcode or codeUrl.Actioncategoriescode, the generated URL needs to keep the codeclient1program1code prefix of the request, for example in the latter case codeclient1program1categoriescode. I need that prefix to remain on every request to maintain custom functionality for that specific clientprogram. We typically manage this with subdomains and DNS, leaving paths alone, but this particular client has compliance problems with running on multiple domains.p  pThe codeclient1code part is static and can be set in code, as those change infrequently, but the codeprogram1code part is dynamic and I need to support changes there without deploying new code.p  pIve been trying to get something working with some combination of URL rewriting, routes, or a custom VirtualPathProvider, but cant seem to get it to work. Session and cookies arent really reliable enough, as they time out and can be cleared. There would be too many places to change to try to get it consistently on the query string. p  pURL rewriting strips the path info away before the application can see it. It still needs access to read what client and program it should be displaying.p  pRoutes can get the request to the right controller, but subsequent requests from that page then ignore whatever the clientprogram was.p  pA custom codeVirtualPathProvidercode feels like the most promising direction, but the underlying physical path isnt actually changing. It seems more useful for having a separate application in another directory running in the root of a site. Changing it doesnt just change all the route and path handling, it alters the ability of the engine to find views.p  pAny suggestionsp  pstrongEditstrong Routes handle paths that go through that engine, so things like codeUrl.Actioncode work okay with routes. I have other URLs that are generated from codeUrl.Contentcode, so thats probably the question Im really asking stronghow can I change what codecode maps to in codeUrl.Contentcodestrong I think thats why I started looking at codeVirtualPathProvidercode which Im now pretty sure not at all what I need. It is more focused on mapping to local physical file paths.p

Positive 3280 pIm brand new to Rails and Ruby development, so I apologize if this was answered somewhere, I couldnt find anything addressing my exact question.p  pLets say I want to add a RESTful endpoint to a resource, lets say form. The default CRUD actions Im using to actually edit and create forms. I want to add an endpoint to allow a POST to submit a form. Lets not get bogged down in the plan and design of this, I use this just as an example to make my question clear. If I make submission a nested resource which doesnt really make sense to me anyway  submission is an action, not a resource in this case, the route generated for me expects an id for the associated form. I get that. So something like this is what is generatedp  pformsidsubmissionp  pHowever lets say I want to still have forms in the url so doesnt seem like I want a shallow path scope  i.e. Im not looking to do submission to look like thisp  pformssubmissionp  pHow can I do this Is my problem that Im trying to fit a square peg into a round hole with making it a resource Do I need to resort to something explicit and nonRESTful like this outside of my resource routep  ppost formssubmission  formssubmissionp  pIf Im missing something more RailsRuby specific please let me know, because Im still learning. However I get the feeling its more of a REST issue and me going about it incorrectly. p  pBasically, I already have a POST action to create a form, so at the end of the day Im just trying to add another POST action to the resource forms but without requiring a form id in the path, but still wanting form in the path. In this case I dont care which form the user has submitted, we treat them all the same, so the id isnt relevant. The only time I care about the form id is when a form is being requested or edited.p  pThanks p

If I do this and I then decide I didnt really want to do it after all, I can press strongustrong to undo the paste command I carried out in file2.p  pAnother way to do it is to use the diff put command dp. However, if after doing this I decide I didnt mean to do it, I cant undo it simply by pressing strongustrong because my cursor is still in file1 and the strongustrong command will undo the most recent change to file1, emnotem the most recent change to file2.

Negative 3280 pActiveX combobox objects in Excel do not behave well when their ListFillRange refers to a formulabased Named Range Defined Name.p  pI think I have encountered other errors and possibly even Excel crashes thanks to this, but right now all that happens is the comboboxchange event is triggered anytime ANY cell in the workbook is changed.p  pI am not sure if this is really a bug, or if there is a fix, or a workaround.  If it is a bug, how do I report it to the Excel peoplep  pAnd finally, the real meat of my question is How do I work around this issue best  I would like to have some formulabased named ranges, but it emseemsem like this wont be possible.p  pTo reproduce this bug, do the followingp  ol liCreate a new workbook.  On Sheet3, create a small table 3 columns across, and several rows high.li liCreate a named range with this formula or an equivalent OFFSETSheet3A2C36,0,0,COUNTASheet3AA,COUNTASheet344 To do this use InputNameDefine.  Name the range something like demoRangeli liGo to Sheet1 and create a combobox, emit must be on a separate sheetem.  Use the Control Toolbox menu, emnotem the Forms menu.li liClick on the Design Mode button the blue triangle with pencil, then right click on the  combo box and go to Properties.li liIn the properties window for the combobox, change the ListFillRange property so that it points at the named range you created in step 2 demoRange.li liYou may want to change the ColumnCount property to 3, and the ColumnWidths property to 50,50,50li liSet the linkedCell property to cell A1 by typing A1 in the linkedCell property.li liClose the properties window, and double click on the combobox to define its change event.li liPut a Debug.Assertfalse or Msgboxdemo line in the subroutine for the new comboboxs change event.li liExit design modeli liemimportantem  Now select an item in the combobox.  The event should trigger normally the first time.  The bug will not show if you dont do this stepsomething must be selected in the comboboxli liEdit cells anywhere in the workbook [Edit] or any other open workbook [edit], on any sheet and any location.  Each time you edit any cell, at least for me, the onchange event for the combo box is run.li ol  pAgain, is this normal, and what is the best alternative for what I am doing  This combo box gets linked to various cells, and is supposed to be a replacement for the tiny font in the data validation dropdowns excel provides by default.p

Negative 3280 pI have a custom thread pool class, that creates some threads that each wait on their own event signal. When a new job is added to the thread pool, it wakes the first free thread so that it executes the job.p  pThe problem is the following  I have around 1000 loops of each around 10000 iterations do to. These loops must be executed sequentially, but I have 4 CPUs available. What I try to do is to split the 10000 iteration loops into 4 2500 iterations loops, ie one per thread. But I have to wait for the 4 small loops to finish before going to the next big iteration. This means that I cant bundle the jobs.p  pMy problem is that using the thread pool and 4 threads is much slower than doing the jobs sequentially having one loop executed by a separate thread is much slower than executing it directly in the main thread sequentially.p  pIm on Windows, so I create events with codeCreateEventcode and then wait on one of them using codeWaitForMultipleObjects2, handles, false, INFINITEcode until the main thread calls codeSetEventcode. p  pIt appears that this whole event thing along with the synchronization between the threads using critical sections is pretty expensive p  pMy question is  is it normal that using events takes a lot of time  If so, is there another mechanism that I could use and that would be less timeexpensive p  pHere is some code to illustrate some relevant parts copied from my thread pool class p  precode thread function unsigned stdcall ThreadPoolthreadFunctionvoid params       some housekeeping     HANDLE signals[2]     signals[0]  waitSignal     signals[1]  endSignal      do       wait for one of the signals     waitResult  WaitForMultipleObjects2, signals, false, INFINITE       try to get the next job parameters     if tpgtgetNextJobthreadId, data       execute job     void output  jobFuncdata.params       tell thread pool that were done and collect output     tpgtcollectOutputdata.ID, output           tpgtthreadDonethreadId          while waitResult  WAITOBJECT0  0       if we reach this point, endSignal was sent, so we are done       return 0    create all threads for int i  0 i lt nbThreads i  threadData data unsigned int threadId  0 char eventName[20]  sprintfseventName, 20, WaitSignald, i  data.handle  HANDLE beginthreadexNULL, 0, ThreadPoolthreadFunction,         this, CREATESUSPENDED, ampthreadId data.threadId  threadId data.busy  false data.waitSignal  CreateEventNULL, true, false, eventName  thisgtthreads[threadId]  data   start thread ResumeThreaddata.handle    add job void ThreadPooladdJobint jobId, void params       housekeeping     EnterCriticalSectionampthisgtmutex       first, insert parameters in the list     thisgtjobs.pushbackjob       then, find the first free thread and wake it     for it  thisgtthreads.begin it  thisgtthreads.end it      thread  threadData itgtsecond      if thread.busy      thisgtthreads[thread.threadId].busy  true      thisgtnbActiveThreads       wake thread such that it gets the next params and runs them     SetEventthread.waitSignal     break                LeaveCriticalSectionampthisgtmutex  codepre
Negative 3280 pRecently for a programming class, we were given the assignment to write a program in any language that, given emnem, will produce all the possible derangements for an array empem of size emnem such that empem[i]  i for all i  0 lt i lt n.  We had to use iterators, e.g. codeyieldcode.p  pExample n3, [0, 1, 2] is not a derangement, but [2, 0, 1] is as well as [1, 2, 0].p  pI came up with a pseudocode solution that would work, but the problem was that it required power loops that is, emnem nested loops where emnem is only known at runtime.  To do this, I generated emnem nested loops in Ruby code in a string, then codeevalcodeed the string.  My solution worked, however my professor thought that using a few codegotocodes would have been better solution easier to read, at least than dynamic code generation.p  pI was under the impression that codegotocode was always a bad choice.  Why might runtime evaluation of dynamically generated code be a worse choice than codegotocode  The generated code is clean and simple, and seems fairly efficient for the given problem.  The only user input upon which the code generation depends is emnem, which is checked to ensure its an integer value beforehand.  It codeyieldcodes only unique derangements, as it should.p  pIm not asking for a solution to my programming assignment, I just want to know reasons behind the use of codegotocode over dynamic code evaluation, or vice versa.p  pstrongEditstrong  to clarify, the assignment included writing a program using iterators and another using recursion, so the iterative version wasnt necessarily meant to be efficient.p

Negative 3280 pI am new to Objective C with a background primarily in database programming. I am developing an iPhone medical application that involves multiple formulas for calculations, using many variables. Essentially each formula will have its own screen, but numeric entries and calculations from each screen should appear on the screens for other formulas that share common entries, as the user navigates between screens, and variable values changed on one screen should update if appearing on another screen.p  pI understand the potential pitfalls of global variables, but it seems that a set of global variables is what I need. I am wondering what the best method to accomplish this goal is. I have reviewed the use of singletons on this site and in Apples documentation, and perhaps this method is the solution. I also was wondering perhaps if delving into Core Data is the right path, saving the numeric variables entered or calculated on one screen, to be retrieved when a new formula is brought up on another screen.p  pThanks in advance for any advice.p

Cocoa streams have the ability to designate TLS as the the socket security level system with NSStreams setProperty function.  p  pIt seems, however, that this must be done before the connection is opened.  If this is the case, then is the client expected to disconnect after receiving code 220 from the server in response to STARTTLS and then reconnect while specifying TLSp  pOr rather, is this just a limitation of NSStream Do plain sockets renegotiate TLS or SSL without being closedp  pFurthermore, once STARTTLS has been issued and the subsequent negotiating completed, is any other encodingdecoding expected on the part of the clientp  pApologies if these are simple questions.  Ive had difficulty finding proper examples.p  pCheersp

Negative 3280 pIm trying to grasp my head around the best way to carry out something.p  pIm creating a very simple forum, using ASP.NET MVC and LINQ to SQL. Very simple means it has no categories, and each message consists of a subject, a composer and the message contents. Comments can be threaded, but only go one level deep if you comment on a child message, it will appear as though you commented on the parent message of that child.p  pOh, I also properly paginated the forum.p  pNow, the ASP.NET MVC flow bit Im trying to understandp  pWhen someone goes to codeHomeForumpagecode I create a model for the view with 2 objects  a list of all the messages to show in the proper order of parents and children. I create the list serverside, and a codeforumMessage newMessagecode object, so if the user creates a new message, or replies to an existing message, I can easily populate the object and send it back to the server.p  pHowever, after reading stronglotsstrong of articles on validation, models, etc., it seems to me as though I would be better off using brokendown message fields to be filled out by the user i.e codeString messageComposer String messageComposer String messageContentscode, since it will be easier to define validation rules for them.p  pThis is for two reasons p  p1 since the codeforumMessagecode object is created using LINQ to SQL, its kinda of an issue to define its validation rules yes, I know you can use a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1420136validationwithaspnetmvclinqtosqlhowdoiavoideditingageneratedsourcbuddy classesa, but Im kinda scared Oo p  pand what seems to be the bigger reason 2 in all validation examples, if the data that was needed to be validated was passed as an object i.e codeforumMessagecode, then it was the only object in the model. I saw no reference to scenarios in which the model consisted of data which was also used simply to populate the views in my case  the forum messages for the particular page. p  pbrp  h2Which brings me to thish2  pstrongSo far, whenever I had to get input from the user, I passed along the objects which I wanted to display or populate as the actual LINQ to SQL objects.strong p  pstrongWas I going about this the wrong way Should I pass LINQ to SQL objects i.e. classes for display purposes, but use plain old fields strings, ints, etc. for the data I want to retrieve, and create the actual LING to SQL object server side, when I get all the data back to the controllerstrongp  pIm at a crossroads here, and would appreciate some help from seasoned veterans p  pThank youp

These are the scenariosp  pstrongThumnails squarestrong width and height is the same, so it should probably use the shortest image dimension.p  pstrongImagePlaceholder mostly rectangularstrong  static heightwidth. The image needs to fill both heightwidth so there wont be any blank areas in the placeholder. Whats excessive in one of the dimensions will be cropped. Could probably be combined with the Thumbnail one just with checks on the dimensions if the width  height to determine if its a square or not. p  pstrongPhotoWrapperstrong  max heightwidth. The entire image will be adjusted to fit within these proportions. No cropping, just basic resize to fit within 2 given container dimensions. p  pIf someone could help me with this, or know a plugin what I could use, itd be awesome. p

Negative 3280 pIve been working on a school assignment that makes pretty heavy use of vectors, sets, stacks and queues.p  pWhat is the difference between codeFoocode and codeBarcode, especially when passing codeFoocode and codeBarcode between functions  When would it be safe to call delete on Bar, if ever  Im guess its never safe to call codedeletecode on codeBarcode unless everything in that vector has been moved  If I return codeFoocode, wont it and its contents be deleted when the function exitsp  precodevectorltLine gt Foo codepre  pandp  precodevectorltLine gt  Bar  new vectorltLine gt codepre  pSimilary, lets say I have a functionp  precodevectorltLine gt BSTIndexquerystring expression      vectorltLine gt result Holds the lines that match the expression     string query  expression     queueltstringgt  output  expressionParserquery     doSomeStuffWithOutputHere     return result  codepre  pAnd my expressionParser isp  precodequeueltstringgt  BSTIndexexpressionParserstring query      char  cQuery  new char[100]     strcpyscQuery, 100,query.cstr     strcpycQuery, query.cstr     queueltstringgt  output  new queueltstringgt Operators go in the queue     stackltstringgt  s  new stackltstringgt  Operands go on the stack     performSomeMagicOnQueueAndStackHere     return output  codepre  pThe stack is actually only local to expressionParser so I KNOW I can remove the new keyword from that.  The queue however, needs to go back to the query function where its used but then thats it.  Do I HAVE To create a pointer to the queue in this case I want to say yes because its going to fall out of scope when expressionParser returns.  If I need to create the pointer, then I should call a delete output in my query function to properly get rid of the queuep  pMy last concern is the vector being returned by query.  Should that be left as I have it or should it be a pointer and whats the difference between them  Once I consume that vector display the information in it I need it to be removed from memory, however, the pointers contained in the vector are still good and the items being pointed to by them should not be deleted.  Whats the best approach in this casep  pWhat happens to the contents of containers when you call delete on the container  If the container held pointers, and those pointers are deleted wont that affect other areas of my programp

Negative 3280 pI have a C library that is loaded by a C application and I am trying to interop with a C SDK using my own C DLL.  The SDK needs to be able to send me asynchronous messages and it will accept a window handle.  My C DLL needs to be able to parse those messages.p  pI have created a generic window with a window proc.  Its being created successfully but I cant seem to process messages.  After creating the window Ive tried calling SendMessage and PostMessage just to see if the messages are going through, and theyre not.p  pI am not sure how the message queue works, but since my DLL shares the same HINSTANCE as the calling C program, then my messages should go into its queue and it should dispatch them to my window proc based on the window handle.  But its not happening.p  pI have tried to create a timer in the DLL to check for messages specific to that window handle every so often like followsp  precodevoid CALLBACK TimerFuncHWND hWnd, UINT u, UINTPTR uptr, DWORD dw      MSG msg      if GetMessageampmsg, ghMessageWindow, userMessage, userMessage gt 0              TranslateMessageampmsg         DispatchMessageampmsg           return  codepre  pBut the window proc is never called even when I manually trigger a SendMessage or PostMessage to the window.p  pAt this point I figure if I cant send messages to my own window, then the messages from the SDK Im using probably arent going through either.p  pI have gone so far as to create a message loop in my C DLL after it creates the window just for testing purposes and, again, its not receiving any messagesp  precodePostMessageghMessageWindow, userMessage, 0, 0  MSG msg while 1      GetMessageampmsg, ghMessageWindow, userMessage, userMessage     TranslateMessageampmsg     DispatchMessageampmsg  codepre  pI am literally posting a message and then waiting for it to show up, but it never does.  My window proc is as followsp  precodeLRESULT CALLBACK MessageWndProcHWND hWnd, UINT uMsg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam      switch uMsg          case userMessage         MessageBoxNULL, userMessage received., NULL, MBOK         break      default         return DefWindowProchWnd, uMsg, wParam, lParam           return 0  codepre  pI am pretty sure its being called correctly because CreateWindow will fail if I dont implement the default return DefWindowProc case.p

Negative 3280 pim attempting to maximize the scale of an image so that it uses as much of the allowable pixel limit as possible.p  pthe language im using is ActionScript 3.0, but this problem is empurely math relatedem, and unfortunately im not the sharpest calculator in the drawer.p  pfrom the ActionScript 3.0 documentation on a hrefhttphelp.adobe.comenUSFlashPlatformreferenceactionscript3flashdisplayBitmapData.html relnofollowBitmapDataap  blockquote   pthe maximum size for a BitmapData object is 8,191 pixels in width or   height, and the total number of pixels cannot exceed 16,777,215   pixels.

Negative 3280 pI have an application that uses the grails multitenantcore plugin to host multiple versions of a site.

I am using a DNS resolver thats persisted in my database, so I could presumably add a property to the codeDomainTenantMapcode domain class that assigns a codetemplateDircode property to a particular tenant and sprinkle conditional logic all over the place in my GSPs and controllers. followed by that cant...get...clean feelingp  pI havent had any success finding an existing plugin that provides this functionality.  The other options I have considered seem to involve customizing fairly core pieces of grails render tag, template engine, etc. which makes me nervous.  p  pI realize this is a fairly broad question both specific solutions and general suggestions are appreciated.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI found another possible approach by creating a plugin and metaprogramming on a new methodp  precodedef configureTemplateRendererapplication, applicationContext      for controllerClass in application.controllerClasses           controllerClass.metaClass.newRender   args gt             println something             ifargs.view                  args.view  somedirargs.view                          ifargs.template                  args.template  somedirargs.template                          delegate.renderargs                codepre  pThis is just a proof of concept to see if I can invoke the standard coderendercode method through my new one I can.  Ideally, I could override the coderendercode method entirely to modify the codeargs.viewcode and codeargs.templatecode property based on some sort of tenanttemplate mapping not shown.  However, I havent been able to override the coderendercode method successfully so this solution is really only marginally better than just sprinkling in some path variable to calls to coderendercode.  p  pstrongA Solutionstrongp  pI ended up creating a separate plugin that essentially boils down to overriding the render method with one that checks a tenanttemplate map.

Negative 3280 pIn short p  pUnder what scenarios can running a multithreaded app on a single core destroy performance p  pWhat about setting the affinity of a multithreaded app to only use one corep  pIn longp  pIm trying to run the physics of a 2D engine on its own thread. It works, and at first performance seemed normal, but I decided to tell the game to try and run at 10K FPS and the physics at 120FPS, went into Task Manager and set the affinity to where the program could only use one core.p  pThe FPS was at 1700 before setting the affinity to one core, afterwards it went to 70FPS. I didnt expect that kind of decrease. I told the game to try and run at 300 FPS and physics at 60FPS. p  pSame thing happened.p  pI didnt give it much thought, so I just continued modifying the engine. I tested it again later after changing some of the drawing code, 300 FPS, 60FPS for physics. With all cores allowed it managed 300FPS just fine, with affinity to a single core FPS dropped down to 4. Now I know it cant possibly be that bad running a multithreaded app on a single core or am I ignorant of something that happens when you set the affinity to a single core.p  pThis is about how the renderingphysics runs...p  pLoop startsp  pGather input until 1.0  FPS has passed.p  pCall update.p  pLock physics thread mutex because things in the game will be using the physics data and I dont want the engine updating anything until everything in this update call finishes.p  pUpdate everything in the game which may send a Draw function objectHolds what to draw, where to draw, how to draw to the Render queue.p  pUnlock mutex.p  pRenderer calls operator on each function object and removes them from queue.p  pupdate screen.p  prepeat loop.p  pPhysics thread loopp  precode    ALLEGROTIMER timeralcreatetimer1.0f  60.0f     double prevCount0      alstarttimertimer     whiletrue              automutex lockmmutex          ifmshutdown             break         if mallowedToStep             continue                      Dont run too fast.

Negative 3280 pIm trying to use the RGBImageFilter to produce a simple transparency effect on an image, however during testing I found that all of my filtered images come out as blank with black backgound.  I simplified my filter to a simple No Operation filter that just returns the RGB value that was passed in.  Even this simplified NoOp filter produces  a blank image.  Ive tried this with importing and exporting both JPG and PNG with the same affect.  Ive tried various example filters off the internet that produce the same all black image problem.

Negative 3280 pI have an MVC Application in which users can send a large number of emails each of which is customized, so no bulk send option.  Rather than have the user wait for this, Im queuing the emails to be sent on a schedule.  What I would like to do is have a windows service make a periodic call to my application to trigger the emails.  However, I really dont want to create a whole new web service project just for this one action.  Is there any way to just wrap the behavior in an MVC Action and have the service call this action in a way similar to calling a web service without needing to launch a browser window  If not, is it possible to host a web service method inside an mvc application  If so, any good references on how to do this would be greatly appreciated.  My searches have not been fruitful.p

Negative 3280 pSo heres what Im trying to do. I have a hardware token with some certs on it and Im writing a Java application to try and access those certs. I have used the SunPKCS11 library in jre6 for a windows 32 bit machine. This is a small sample of how I access the certsp  precodeString configName  pkcs.cnf String PIN  123456 Provider p  new sun.security.pkcs11.SunPKCS11configName Security.addProviderp KeyStore keyStore  KeyStore.getInstancePKCS11 char[] pin  PIN.toCharArray keyStore.loadnull, pin codepre  pIt works great, Im able to get the certs and everything. Now Im trying to do the same on a 64 bit machine. However I am trying to use the 64 bit jre6 library and that is missing the SunPKCS11 jar file codelocated in java.homelibextcode. Because of that I cannot create a SunPKCS11 object. My question to you is, what do I do now How can I access the certs on a token using 64 bit java libraries Has someone written a 64 bit wrapper for such a taskp

Negative 3280 pAs stated in the question title, I am having an issue with running a custom URLstoneware.app.switcher from my simple webView application. When the webView app is started, it automatically loads a page that has a custom url link. When clicked, the link should start a local application on my android tablet. Said local application was written by me and I am positive that it is installed. When I click that link from inside the browser, it launches the local application without a hitch.

Negative 3280 pIve build a librarystyle SQLite iOS app using the code in the Recipes sample app, and it works  updates on one device are eventually reliably propagated to all other devices running the same app. Ive been testing it with multiple events per hour all day long, and all the log transactions do get to every device. However, the time for the updates to propagate is highly variable. If I bring the app up and let it sit, it could be a relatively long time before the cloud sends update transactions to the app, and so whats onscreen remains old data for that same long time. Worse, theres no indication the data is out of date.p  pIf I cause the app to post a change to the cloud, though, updates strongemfromemstrong the cloud propagate down relatively soon. That suggests that I could put in a hack that periodically posts pointless changes to the database, but even then I wont know if Ive received all the changes.p  pFirst question Do methods that will force transactions to propagate exist a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9184264icloudupdatepolicyoncoredataindevelopmentandproductionmodea This threada suggests not. p  pSecond question Is there a way to detect if the local database is out of date I dont want to tickle the cloud copy incessantly, but doing so now and then until the database is current might not be such a bad idea.p

Negative 3280 pI had an interview few days ago, and the employer asked me about secure way to serve API service. He saidp  ol liEach API request requires API key.li liEach API request will request 1 single method, which takes a single parameter, and every service will work through this single method.li ol  pHe wanted to see if there is a secure way for a client side to API request to the server side without exposing the API key.p  pI talked about general publicprivate cryptography, but he wanted simpler method than that. p  pIn the end, he talked about using common hash algorithm md5, sha1 for client side to safely hash its key, and also hash the method with parameter and request to the server, but I do not think I got the point very well.p  pI remember some libraries out there first encodes the body of the API request to be encrypted with md5 or sha1. But what is the point of doing it with 1way hash It may be true that maninthemiddle wont know about API key, but how will server know 1.API key, 2.What method that client has requestedp

Negative 3280 pI have an app where I need to archive information when the user closes the app. Naturally, I do this in codeapplidcationDidEnterBackgroundcode. Also, I invalidate all of my NSTimers in codeapplidcationDidEnterBackgroundcode. Oddly enough, if you close the app and then immediately lock the phone, wait a couple of seconds, and then go back into the app, one of two things happens 1. None of the information got archived this works if you close the app normally or 2. The app hangs in the splash screen until it crashes. p  pLocking the phone isnt the only way to get the above to happen, It has happened before but I have never been able to pinpoint when. Locking it is an example that consistently makes it happen.p  pTo be clear, I am not completely sure if codedidEnterBackgroundcode is the cause of this, but it is my best guess.I have been looking for a while and cannot find the solution to this bug, I would greatly appreciate if anybody knew what might be going on. p  pThank you so much,p

Negative 3280 pI had a rails 3 app on NginxPassenger that I just moved to NginxThin 1.3.1. However, my app is now clearly slower than it was on Passenger. A lot of requests time out too.p  pThin is an evented webserver. From what I have read about evented web servers, they dont have a concept of workers. One worker handles everything. So if one request is waiting on IO, thin just moves on to the next request and so one. One explanation I read about evented servers said that evented servers should perform as well or better than worker based servers because they are only bound by system resources.p  pHowever, my CPU usage is very little. My memory usage is very little too, and there isnt much IO happening either. My app just makes a few MySQL queries.p  pWhat is the bottleneck here Shouldnt my thin server handle requests until CPU is at 100 Do I have to do anything different in my app for it to perform better with an evented serverp

Then set the selection color, this didnt work either.

I tried something similar to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions455713selectivelycoloringtextinrichtextboxSelectively coloring text in RichTextBoxa .

Then it sets the selection position to 0 and the selection length to 1, then the color to black. It then inserts s, the selection position to 1 and the length to 1, and the color to red. Then it inserts df sets the selection position to 2 and the length to 2 and the color to black. Then all the output is black.p  pI also tried a variety of things with the selection starting location and length then inserting text without having any effect. I think it is likely that I am doing something incorrect only vaguely related to the text box.p  pWhat else can affect coloring behavior that I may not be paying attention to.p

Negative 3280 pMy overall goal is make a margin between content with 100 height and a sticky footer one that shows the body background through it.p  pAs of now, Im using jQuery to figure out the height of the document and subtract the height of the footer plus a margin, then apply that new size to a DIV with the ID of content.p  pI then use jQuerys resize function to also size the div if the size of the viewport changes so if a user resizes his or her browser window, or zooms in, the size of the DIV will update automatically.p  pUnfortunately, when I switch directions in zooming i.e. zoom out after zooming in, and vice versa, the Javascript doesnt recognize the viewport resizing, leaving me with a toolong or tooshort background on the content. In addition, this resizing does not recognize content.

Negative 3280 pI have written a library and I use that library in a program. I often make a change in the program code, run tests with asserts turned on and then if the tests pass I run a benchmark with asserts turned off to measure the performance impact of the change I just made. I also want to turn the asserts on in my library for the tests and to turn them off in the library for the benchmark. So I frequently need to switch the assert setting simultaneously in the program and the library.p  pMatching the assert settings NDEBUG for the library and the program that uses the library must not be manual because getting it wrong means undefined behavior as there are asserts in the headers conflicting definitions causes undefined behavior and indeed I get a crashing program with GCC when I build an assertoff program with an asserton library. I havent been able to find out what the standard way to do this is. Im considering having my library build system install two binaries and possibly headers that complain if they are included with the wrong assert setting NDEBUG named libfoo1.0 and libfooassert1.0 or something like that.p  pWhat is the best way to match the assert setting between libraries and programs in such a way that switching the assert setting in both at the same time is easy, fast and not error pronep

Negative 3280 pWhat are the strategies to account for memory consumed by a process For example I have a program and in an old version its usage of memory was suboptimal and it wasnt being released at the right time, which meant that it held onto the allocation for longer than it should. Note that I dont mean it leaked. A new version of the program revised the algorithm and now memory is released sooner in the programs lifetime. How can one track this Some ways that come to mind are write a mallocnew replacement library that wraps libclibstdc, somehow use valgrind to do it or sample the memory used by the process using ps and plot a graph p

Negative 3280 pI have a main JFrame which holds a default JPanel. Im trying to use this JPanel to attach different JPanels to my application to simulate the effect of browsing through the application. I noticed that for CardLayout to work, the JFrame usually has to have some way of controlling what is displayed in the JPanel ex. a button, drop down box, etc. What Im attempting to do is have a home pageJPanel load up into the default JPanel in the JFrame and allow the user to navigate using the clickable buttonsicons available in that home JPanel. p  pSince the JFrame and default JPanel are in a separate class from the rest of the JPanels, Im having trouble accessing the default JPanel since it is private to change what appears on it by clicking a button on a JPanel in one of the other classes. Is there any way around thisp  pAlso, would it work if I attached every button necessary in the application to the JFrame and controlled the JPanel displayed from there I could make the button visibleinvisible as necessary, does this make sensep  pThis is the code Im calling in the JFrame classp  precode private void jButton45MouseClickedjava.awt.event.MouseEvent evt      CardLayout card CardLayout displayPanel.getLayout     card.showdisplayPanel, register  codepre  pdisplayPanel is the default Panel that cycles through all the cards and jButton45 is a button titled Register in the JFrame. register is the name of the JPanel variable which Im trying to display.p

Negative 3280 pIm considering using LESS for CSS development with server or development side processing, but I cant decide if I should keep the generated CSS files in version control. There are plenty of solutions with hooks, but this adds software dependencies to the server. A hook could just be added locally so staging and production areas on the web would get the same files. So, the question isp  pShould generated CSS files be included in version control or not Please keep in mind that some frameworks require a CSS file to exist for a particular reason i.e. WordPress themes require a style.css file in order to be recognized.p  pCheersp  pEdit When I say considering using LESS, I mean it becomes a requirement. New developers would not have the option use vanilla CSS after the choice is in favor of LESS.p

My ultimate goal is to split out each statement and run it individually so I can catch any errors that come up and gracefully handle them.p

Negative 3280 pI am loading 4 partial views in a page. The main page that contains all the partial views in separate divs and each partial view has its own knockout model. The issue that I am having is that the individual knockout models cannot bind values for text fields and what not. p  pI would like to keep the pages separate so the main page is not so cluttered and tightly coupled to the partial views. This is essentially a summary of these 4 pages that were previously completed. p  pIt seems that I cannot pull the knockout models out since they need information from the controller to populate the partial view and I do not want to pull the partial views into this page.p  pEssentially I want to load partial views with their own knockout models and have desired functionality. p

Negative 3280 pWe are currently working on a project for college which we would like to implement as a logic module and UI module. We have little experience deploying web applications, however we came up with the following alternatives p  ol liDeploy it as a single WAR project which would solve the problem we have about communicating the UI with the backend of our application.li liDeploy two WAR projects in the same server using webservices for communication between the projects. We have a prototype using this approach deployed on a Tomcat serverli liDeploy a WAR project and EJB project.li liDeploy an EAR project which would contain the references to the WAR and EJB projects. We have a prototype using this approach deployed on a Glassfish serverli ol  pWe would like to know if any of these alternatives is incorrect, or if any of the alternatives is better than the other. Specifically, why would it be useful or not to deploy the project as an EAR modulep  pThe project right now is starting, so we will only be handling a couple hundreds of users right now. However, if the project succeeds we would need to deal with a couple million of users.p

Negative 3280 pAlright, so I enjoy making forum software with PHP and MySQL, though theres one thing that has always troubled me, and one thing onlyp  pThe main page of the forums, where you view the list of the forums. Each forum shows the forum name, the number of posts made in that forum, the number of discussions made in that forum, and the last poster in the forum. There lies the problem, getting all of that data when all of those things are stored in different tables. Its not much of a problem to GET it, not really a problem at all, but to do it EFFICIENTLY is what Im after.p  pMy current approach is this Store the current number of posts, discussions, and the last poster statically in the forum table itself instead of going out and grabbing the data from the different tables  posts, discussions, forums, etc. Then when a user posts, it updates that forums table, incrementing the number of posts by 1 and updating the last poster, and also incrementing the discussions by 1 if theyre making a new discussion. This just seems inefficient and dirty to me for some reason, but maybe its just me.p  pAnd heres another approach that I fear would be horribly inefficient Actually going out to each table  posts, discussions, forums  and grabbing the data. The problem with this is, there can be hundreds of forums on one page... And Id have to use a COUNT statement to fetch the number of posts or discussions, meaning Id have to use subqueries  not to mention a third subquery to fetch the last poster. That being said... The query would be something like this psuedocodelikethingp  pre classlangsql prettyprintoverridecodeSELECT foruminfo,      SELECT COUNTid     FROM posts     WHERE forumId  someid ,      SELECT COUNTid     FROM discussions     WHERE forumId  someid ,      SELECT postinfo     FROM posts     WHERE forumId  someid     ORDER BY postdate     DESC LIMIT 1  FROM forums ORDER BY position DESC codepre  pSo basically those subqueries could be run hundreds of times if I have hundreds of forums being listed. And with hundreds of users viewing the page every second, would this not put quite a bit of strain on Im not entirely sure if subqueries cause the same amount of load as normal queries or not, but if they do then it seems like it would certainly be horribly inefficient. p  pAny ideas p

Negative 3280 pHow do I get Google Maps to stay this wayp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comT3Jan.png altenter image description herep  pI dont want it to show the marker point.p  pMy solution was to use codesetTimeIntervalcode with codegmap.setCentercode by step 1 sec to make a codesetCentercode works. When the map is in fullscreen the codesetCentercode function works.

Negative 3280 pHeres the thing, we want to be able to cache our partialstemplates, using http headers.p  pAfter some thought we ended up with wanting to put our templates to the initially loaded html using the codescriptcode directive.p  pWhich would work just fine, as long as the url will use the hashcodeindex.htmlsomething123code. Since codeindex.htmlcode would be cached no matter what I put after the hash.p  pNow what if I want to use the html5mode Since the url is the key for caching codeindexsomething123code and codeindexsomething321code wouldnt be loaded from the cache, even though itd still be the same codeindex.htmlcode.. am I making any sense so farp  pHow can html5mode and http caching work along Other than putting all the templates to a separated filep  p..a little extra question, one of the reasons we wanted to use the script directive and not load the partials in a separated request because the only way I came up withto load all the partials, would be to load them in say json file with keyval, then run thru it and code.putcode them in the codetemplateCachecode, which is far from ideal. Is there a way to say load a file full of codescriptcode directives I cant really imagine how fast would this be, since itd have to treat it as dom nodes and iterate over them to save it to the codetemplateCachecode, which I think would be easier to work with, but even slower than the json approach..p  pThanksp

Negative 3280 pAt work, a question arose in regards to the performance impact of having a MultiTrigger in the ListBoxItem ControlTemplate. p  pThe situation goes a bit like this we have a custom styling for the ListBox control that defines an animation and color for the selected ListBoxItem. The issue arose because when the ListBox is disabled, we do not want the selected ListBoxItem to show the selected background highlight. This led us to add a set of triggers in the ControlTemplate of ListBoxItems to disable this custom highlighting when the ListBoxItem is disabled and selected. This is where the worry for a negative performance impact originated p  pIf every ListBoxItem needs to check for triggers and activate for triggers, would this generate a strongnoticeablestrong performance impact if there were a lot of items. This could be an issue because this code runs on strongolderstrong computers.p

Negative 3280 pI have a table codeEmployercode and table codeEmployerParamcode. Having these two in a 1 to many relationship was a slight misjudgement in the DB design.

My jQuery knowledge outside of just implementation is pretty poor.p  pIm building the Magnific Popup a hrefhttpdimsemenov.compluginsmagnificpopup relnofollowhttpdimsemenov.compluginsmagnificpopupa jQuery plugin into my WordPress theme as a popup gallery. Ive got it all wired up and working. It grabs images dynamically from the backend using custom fields. I can also get multiple instances working on the same page. HOWEVER, when scrolling through images in one popup gallery, it wont end at the end of the first gallery but rather, it will move on into the images in the second gallery. See example a hrefhttpwww.oftenvisual.comresetgalleries relnofollowhttpwww.oftenvisual.comresetgalleriesa. p  pUnfortunately I cant post the code here as its too long, but hopefully the demo page helps. Because the galleries are generated dynamically and the client using the backend wont have the knowledge to add container with different classes, I need some way to also dynamically separate out the galleries.

Negative 3280 pRecently Im improving my OpenGL ES skills looking into the source code of a hrefhttpsgithub.comBradLarsonGPUImage relnofollowGPUImagea. While I was reading the code for the codeGPUImageContextcode class I get that it stores a reference to a codequeuecode that its used in other parts of the library. p  pFor example in codeGPUImageView.mcode the queue is used in codecommonInitcode with coderunSynchronouslyOnVideoProcessingQueuecode to perform some operations not directly related with the context like adding attributes to the shader. p  pMy question is why the developer has decided to perform these operations on a secondary queue and which is the benefit of storing this queue into a class like the codeGPUImageContextcode.p  pI know that question is strictly related with the GPUImage framework, but I think that it could be a big opportunity to understand how a skilled developer as Brad Larson has decided to structure one of the most famous library for Image Manipulation in iOS.p  pP.s.

Negative 3280 pI am working on a webapp that allows people to share links from Soundcloud by copying and pasting the URL.  Then the webapp generates a running list of people, allowing users to open a modal that loads the a Soundcloud player via SC.oEmbed.  The URL is derived from the  element that opens up the modal.  So SC.oEmbed opens up the URL found within the href attribute.  p  pI have everything working great, except that when the modal is closed the music keeps playing. p  pThere doesnt seem to be a stop or pause function associated with this player like there is with the Widget player.  The only solution I have found is upon close to have SC.oEmbed open up another random soundcloud link but with autoplay off.  This works but seems really inelegant and a waste of resources.

Whatever queries I run on this server must not block the other users. Hence, the DBAs are adamant about no Stored Procedures. They also believe that queries involving Linked Servers will trump i.e. take higher priority to other queries being run against the the database.p  pAny feedback would be greatly appreciated.p  pThanksp  pUpdate additional background information on the project We are primarily integrating PeopleSoft databases the HR and Finance into another product. Some are simple  like AccountCode and Department. Others are more complex, like the personal data, job, and leave accrual. Some are realtime, others are scheduled, and others are batch e.g. at payroll runs.p  pRegardless, we have to get source data out of PeopleSoft database  and my hope had been to let the source database do the heavy lifting by executing SQL Queries. I dont really want BizTalk, or SSIS, or C LINQ to be the ones doing the transformationsfiltering.p  pDefinitely open to suggestions.p

Negative 3280 pI have been trying to get my head around Scalas parser combinators. It seems that they are pretty powerful but the only tutorial examples I seem to find are with mathematical expressions and very little proper realworld parsing examples with DSLs that need to be parsed and mapped to different entities etc.p  pFor the sake of this example, lets say I have this BNF where I have this entity named Model, which is made up of a string like this code[model [name ltnamegt ]]code. This is a simplistic example of a much larger BNF I have and there are more entities in reality.p  pSo I defined my own class codeModelcode which takes the codenamecode as the constructor and then defined my own codeModelParsercode object which extends codeJavaTokenParserscode. I then defined the following parsers, following the BNF I know some may have a simpler regex matcher but I preferred to follow the BNF exactly for other reasons.p  precodedef model  Parser[Model]  [model gt [name gt name lt ]]   Model  def name  Parser[String]  letter  anyChar  case text gt text.toString def anyChar  letter  digit  .r  .r def letter  [azAZ].r def digit  d.r codepre  pThe codetoStringcode of codeModelcode looks like thisp  precodeoverride def toString  String  [model   name  ] codepre  pWhen I try to run it with a string like code[model [name helloWorld]]code I get this  code[model [hListe, l, l, o, W, o, r, l, d]]code instead of what I am expecting code[model helloWorld]codep  pHow do I get those individual characters to join back in the string they were originally inp  pI am also confused with the individual parsers and the use of code.rcode. Sometimes I saw examples where they had just the following as a parser to parse hello p  precodedef hello  hello codepre  pIsnt that just a String How on Earth did it suddenly become a parser that can be combined with other parsers And what is the code.rcode actually doing I have read at least 3 tutorials but still totally lost what is actually happening. p

Negative 3280 pI would like to build an embedded Qt application. This application shall have a couple of windows which are invoked by button click. I dont know if I understood the concept of using qmainwindow in the right wayp  pDo I create one codeQMainWindowcode class and each other window that should be displayed is a widget placed as central widget or is any new window I call a new codeQMainWindowcodep  pI do not use qmainwindows tool, menu or status bar just the dock widgets which surround the central widget, like a header on top and a button bar at the bottom or a widget to the reight like a keyboard. Since the headers label stays the same only the title and the icon changes and the bottom bar always holds some button which should call another central widget or return to the previous one, changing the central widget should be sufficient rightp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comQzxn1.jpg altenter image description herep

Say one plugin is a core plugin com.mycompany.core, and the other is a fancy plugin  com.mycompany.fancy.p  pThe plugin com.mycompany.core is a plugin owned by a different team and is deployed in my companys maven repository, under the group id com.examplep  pMy team owns com.mycompany.fancy. This plugin has a dependency to the plugin com.mycompany.core.p  pFor simplicity sake let me call these plugins fancy and core respectively.p  pWe would like to work with only the fancy plugin in the eclipse IDE.p  pI am currently building the fancy plugin using tycho. The pom file of the fancy plugin has an explicit dependency to core plugin in its dependencies section. I generate the .classpath and the .project for the fancy plugin using  strongMvn eclipseeclipsestrongp  pAfter importing the generated project for the fancy plugin in eclipse IDE, I see that eclipse is not able to resolve the dependency to the core plugin that is specified in its Manifest file. Eclipse reports an error saying strongBundle com.mycompany.core cannot be resolved.strong Under the referenced libraries of the fancy project, I see that eclipse lists  the core plugin. The location of the core plugin jar is Cmvnrepocomexamplecom.mycompany.core1.0.0com.mycompany.core1.0.0.jar This is the location where the Core plugin jar is deployed in maven, and this location is a valid location on my machine.p  pI also see that the generated .classpath file for fancy has the following entry  p  pHowever, eclipse is not able to resolve the dependency entry for the plugin Core in the manifest of Fancy. p  pFrom command line, there are no issues seen. However, the fact that there are errors in eclipse, means that we cannot launchrun anything from within eclipse, which is a show stopper for us.p  pDoes anyone know how to get around this problem, or what it would take for eclipse to recognize the bundle that has been specified with its location in the .classpath filep

Negative 3280 pI would like to load dds files into Qt 5.1 and have the benefit of saving memory and improve rendering performance as dds files in many cases are less in size due to data destroying compression than their png equivalent and also are stored in more cache friendly rendering structure tiling i.e. a hrefhttpfgiesen.wordpress.com20110117texturetilingandswizzling relnofollowhttpfgiesen.wordpress.com20110117texturetilingandswizzlinga than usual raw image data is.p  pBut... I cant find any reference about this topic when googling I only find others who read dds files and convert them into QImage which I suspect only unpacks the dds into a raw rgba only giving some extra performance when reading from disk but keeping all the bad parts like more memory, less efficient texel reading and now also compression artifacts for nothing.p  pHave I missunderstood how Qt is handling textures or can the dds formats dxt15 be utilized corretly within Qt 5.1p  pDoes the QImageReader unpack dds files to raw or actually loads them directly to graphics hardware as isp  pAny other suggestions or pointers is very appreciated.p

Negative 3280 pApologies for the terribly worded question will change it once I work out how to define this problem better.p  pLets say I have a table in a database called codeSuppliercode. A supply can have a codevendor idcode as PK, and codecountrycode. The supplier must be  working on one, and only one project from a set of three predefined project names.p  pWould the best way to capture this data bep  pCreate a table called codeProjectcode which has a codeProject IDcode as PK and Project Name field. Create another table called codeSupplierProjectcode which inherits codevendor idcode and codeProject IDcode as primary keys or is that primary and alternative keys.p  pI am thinking in that way, if a project name was ever updated you would only need to update one field in the codeProjectcode table and not every instance of the project name if instead a field was created in codeSuppliercode table called codeProject Namecode.p  pIt should be noted that multiple companies could be working on the same project at the same time, but they need to be one of the predefined projects from the list.p  pDoes this also increase data integrity has cant enter something which is not on the listp  pIs this a normal thing to do in this situation, sort of creating codepick tablescode through a manytomany relationship structure I am confused because technically the supplier must work on one, and only one project at any time. This structure gives me the pick list but doesnt enforce this rule.p  pHope this is making sense and I am not completely missing the point. Any advice on the best way to handle these situations is much appreciatedp

Negative 3280 pSo I am learning about vimviex and I thought I had a pretty good understanding of the buffer system. theres a gen purpose buffer and you can also name buffers. I know that anytime you use yank, change or delete, the contents of the general purpose buffer are over written. p  pHowever, I was given a task to use a viex command to delete the last 2 lines of the buffer and I am stumped. I cant seem to find the answer by searching the forums or the Internet in general so I thought I would ask the gurus of the interwebs for some help here. p  pIs there a way to directly modify the contents of a buffer, or is the answer simply to paste the buffer, delete the last 2 lines and then yank it again p  pAny help is appreciated.p  pEDIT I would like to edit this question to include the questionwhat is the difference between a buffer and a registerp  pI originally thought they were essentially the same thing, but have since learned otherwise. p  pMy new understanding is that the things I were previously referring to as buffers are actually registers, which makes more sense according to my knowledge of computers. p  pNow, I believe the buffer is just the current copy of the text that you are modifying. Or more specifically, the area of main memory in which you are manipulating data. So the answer to my question would actually just be 1,dp  pHowever, I have run into conflicting information on these forums that say the opposite, referring to registers as Buffers.p  pIf someone could clear that up I would be really appreciative. p  pstrongEDIT vim help got me all the answers I needed, cant delete the post though. It should be noted that there are a lot of answers to questions both on this site and many others that are voted up highly, but refer to registers as buffers incorrectly.strong p

Negative 3280 pI have a website where there is implemented a CSS overlay when the menu is accessed. This overlay fades in and out over the rest of the page but not the menu itself via the zindex. All works well on mouseover, the overlay fades in, and the rest looks dimmed. p  pHowever when the mouse is not on the menu anymore, the fadeout of the overlay is messed up. The overlay itself fades out correctly, but all images show up immediately opacity 1 and that makes it look strange. I think the images have to be fadein when the overlay fadesout. You can see an example on www.appartementtekoop.nl of the behavior.p  pI think the problem is with the zindex of the images, but am not sure.p  pThis is my javascript for the overlayp  precode ltscript typetextjavascriptgt      jQueryfunction             var menumainnav  jQuerymenumainnav           var menumainnavitems  menumainnav.childrenli           var oeoverlay  jQueryoeoverlay           var pricetabledropdown  jQuery.priceheader           var menutoggle  jQuery.menutoggle           var mainmenu  jQuery.mainnav            menumainnavitems.bindmouseenter, function                   var this  jQuerythis                 this.children.addClassslided selected                   updated code starts                 ifthis.children.menuitemhaschildren.hasClassnotshown                     menumainnavitems.not.slided.children.menuitemhaschildren.hide                     this.removeClassslided                                  else                      this.children.menuitemhaschildren.csszindex, 9999.stoptrue, true.slideDown200, function                             menumainnavitems.not.slided.children.menuitemhaschildren.hide                           this.removeClassslided                                                        updated code ends                       .bindmouseleave, function                   var this  jQuerythis                 this.removeClassselected.children.menuitemhaschildren.csszindex, 1                       menumainnav.bindmouseenter, function                   var this  jQuerythis                 oeoverlay.stoptrue, true.fadeTo1000, 0.3                 oeoverlay.csszindex, 40                 this.addClasshovered                         .bindmouseleave, function                   var this  jQuerythis                 this.removeClasshovered                 oeoverlay.stoptrue, true.fadeTo1000, 0                 oeoverlay.csszindex, 0                 menumainnavitems.children.menuitemhaschildren.hide                       pricetabledropdown.bindclick, function                  if jQuery this .hasClassclicked                      jQuery this .removeClassclicked                     jQuery section.detailpage .cssdisplay, none                     jQuery section.detailpage .cssdisplay, block                  else                      jQuery this .addClassclicked                      initialDivHeight  jQuerysection.detailpage.height                                  jQuery this .next.fadeToggle                       menutoggle.bindclick, function                  mainmenu.toggle                   ltscriptgt codepre

Negative 3280 pIm struggling to basically understand how the assignment operator works, or perhaps I havent defined the right one, or Ive come upon some C gotcha not sure.p  pI have a class like thisp  precodeclass A   public     A    Aconst A amprhs     some other ctors    and functions here     Aamp operatorA rhs    A  createhalf     double mdata   codepre  pHere is the body of createhalf it appears to be relevant to the situationp  precodeA Acreatehalf    construct a new A   A mya    do stuff to mya here,   and then return the new A   return mya   codepre  pHere is the copy constructor, at least a shortened version of it.  This is the code that is skipped due to standard  at least if this is whats truly going on.p  precodeAAconst Aamp rhs  mdatanew double[1]      mdata  rhs.mdata     or something similar, essentially     a deep copy  codepre  pThen in the code I try to write something like thisp  precodeA ainstance  do stuff to ainstance  this doesnt call any  operator or  copy ctor I try to define, why A binstance  A.createhalf   but this works fine the  operator I have defd is called A binstance binstance  A.createhalf codepre  pThe line that doesnt work as I want it to seems to do a default copy ie, binstance.mdata is set to ainstance.mdata even though neither my copy ctor now my assignment operator contain this operation.p  pFor the problematic line, Im not able to step into the assignment operator thats why I think I have the wrong signature, or something similar.  p  pAny ideasp  pEDIT Sorry for misleading you guys  no class B exists.p  pEDIT AGAIN Ive accepted an answer, and Ive added some detail to the snippets above to try to elucidate what is really going on.p  pSince the instance of A created by createhalf isnt bound to a reference, the standard allows elision of the copy constructor, which, critically, allocates new memory for binstance, and does the deep copy.p  pThat seems pretty bold, to me  I dont think Ill see an answer, since this edit is sometime after the initial posting, but what would be a better design pattern herep

But Ive set my source as osm. p  precodegt libraryggmap Loading required package ggplot2 Warning message package ggmap was built under R version 3.1.1  Loading required package sp gt getmapsource  osm Error in download.fileurl, destfile  destfile, quiet  messaging, mode  wb     cannot open URL httpmaps.googleapis.commapsapistaticmapcenter29.763284,95.363271ampzoom10ampsize20640x640ampmaptypeterrainampsensorfalse In addition Warning messages 1 package sp was built under R version 3.1.1  2 In download.fileurl, destfile  destfile, quiet  messaging, mode  wb    cannot open HTTP status was 403 Forbidden gt detachsp Error in detachsp  invalid name argument gt detachsp Error in detachsp  invalid name argument gt getmapsource  osm Error in download.fileurl, destfile  destfile, quiet  messaging, mode  wb     cannot open URL httpmaps.googleapis.commapsapistaticmapcenter29.763284,95.363271ampzoom10ampsize20640x640ampmaptypeterrainampsensorfalse In addition Warning message In download.fileurl, destfile  destfile, quiet  messaging, mode  wb    cannot open HTTP status was 403 Forbidden codepre  pThis is the original loop I set up to get my map images. p  precodefori in seqlevelsnamedtrailsTRAILNAME  onetrail lt namedtrails[whichnamedtrailsTRAILNAME  levelsnamedtrailsTRAILNAME[i],] mapcenter lt cminonetraillong  0.02, minonetraillat  0.02, maxonetraillong  0.02, maxonetraillat  0.02 ancmap lt getmapanchorage, AK, source  stamen p lt ggmapancmap      geomlinedata  onetrail, aesx  long, y  lat, color  TRAILNAME      ggtitlelevelsnamedtrailsTRAILNAME[i]      themelegend.positionnone ggsavepastei, .png, sep   Sys.sleep4  codepre  pwindows 7 x86  R 3.1.0 Rstudio Version 0.98.932p

This seemed to work fine. However I an starting to get a little confused. Here we have the subclasses in emis aem relationships, some card strongis astrong card. i am failing to map this in to database tables though.p  pFor example, to incorporate the process of a card table in the database i could have a table for each sub class type, and inside this table i could have an id which references a card table which is generated when a user registers. But, this now means that in my database i have transformed the is a relationship in to has a emThe subclass now has a card rather than is a card.em p  pI am confused and hope someone can clear things up for me.p  pThanksp

Negative 3280 pRecently I noticed some performance issues in my sites javascript code. After some profiling I discovered that the problem is the Marketo Munchking code I use to track events.

The relevant code snippet isp  precodeanew XMLHttpRequesta.openGET,b,1 ... a.send codepre  pIve opened a ticket with Marketo, but until they fix their code, Im looking for a workaround. I thought of a fewp  ol liIs there a way to hook their js code to force the codeXMLHttpRequestcode to be asyncli liIt is safe to reference directly to older versions of their script, for example codemunchkin.marketo.net143munchkin.jscode. I tested it and it works but maybe Im missing something.li ol  pAre there any more workarounds Any thought is appreciated.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pJust got a response from Marketo support. They admit that the calls are indeed synchronous, but they claim that this is the only way not to lose information.

In the mean time Im using an old version of their code.p  pstrongUPDATE 2strongp  pGot another response from their support team that said my ideas are good, but they cant implement them right now, and they hope that one of the developers will pick them up someday...

Negative 3280 h3Problemh3  pUsing codeWKWebViewcode in place of codeUIWebViewcode, I noticed that the contents of the codeWKWebViewcode were massively scaled down as compared to my codeUIWebViewcode. Id like the codeWKWebViewcode to stop doing that, and just respect my CSS values literally, the way codeUIWebViewcode would.p  h3Contexth3  pI use web views in my native iOS app for the contents that go inside popovers on an iPad where Im displaying informational content. Its great being able to give this to content and design folks and say, just drop in some HTML content, referencing the linked CSS file. p  pAll of this worked just great when using codeUIWebViewcode.p  pBut popovers are often quite compact.p  h3What Im Experiencingh3  pIn my narrow popovers, the content is scaled down as if my content where an entire web page being miniaturized to fit. I can see that WKWebView was primarily intended for folks building alternate browsers on iOS or building hybrid apps, where the WKWebView is essentially, taking over the screen.p  pThe magnification factor in WKWebView is not something one can set. Sure, the user can zoom in, but that defeats the purpose. Im not looking for a zoomed in viewport Im looking for the entire content to fit and wordwrap like it would with UIWebView.p  pWith WKWebView, in the simulator, Ill see the sizing I want if I bump up my body text size to 50px instead of 14px. This code however, doesnt even help when on the device, so inflating my CSS sizes is not an option eitherp  h3Whats Wrong with UIWebViewh3  pWell, nothing really. Its not yet deprecated in iOS8, perhaps bc it has usefulness still, as Im experiencing. I did notice however, that WKWebView was fast. And Ive seen some speculation that the writing is on the wall for UIWebView.

Negative 3280 pOk so despite the easy sounding name this question has been running circles around me for ages, cant find much decent documentation on it so hopefully the stack will help that means you XD . Basically the problem revolves around the use of a bespoke wordpress theme, that has been entirely custom built, well, maybe not entirely but enough to make what should be a simple procedure into a needleinahaystack scenario...

Anyone know where I can give my post type this taxonomy, baring in mind that due to this being a bespoke theme that I did not design, there is absolutely zilch functionality in the wordpress back end other than to edit posts of various types, no Apperence  Menus or any of that useful stuff, so it has to be done purely with code. If anyone could even so much as point me in the right direction I would really appreciate it.p  pcheersp

Negative 3280 pI was in need of calling SSRS Reports from classic ASP. After looking around I found that it was suggested that SSRS reports should be called using ASP.Net so I managed to use ASP.Net with my classic ASP application using session transfer.By saving sessions to the database redirecting from classic ASP to ASP.Net. However while redirecting i am passing parameters as querystring Using Response.Redirect. I am wondering when the parameters will be really big will that create any problem.Like select 1000 customer ids each five characters long. I would like to use POST method as I believe it is better and more secure.p  pCan someone please help mep

Negative 3280 pI have a singlepage app that is leaking fairly substantially.  I am trying to track down the memory leaks using Chromes builtin memory profiling tools.  The heap snapshot has been giving me a lot of success in tracking down quite a few problematic code blocks, but I have now reached a bit of a deadend.p  pI have taken a heap snapshot and isolated a variable that has clearly leaked.  I then open it up the retainers view so that I can see why the object has not been garbage collected.  What I am now seeing in the retainers view see below is confusing me.  It keeps reaching a deadend even though it claims that the given node in the graph still has a distance of 11.  Im not sure why it wont let me dig into the object when it says that there is still depth there.  I was expecting that I would be able to expand all the way to a global variable on the window object.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com4M0ko.png altenter image description herep

Negative 3280 pThis is a twoparter, because I think there is feedback between the two parts and answers to one may influence answers to the other.p  pI am writing a custom WP plugin to provide a kind of history and cataloging function.

It uses hidden fields to initialize the slider based on the type of value being manipulated.  Also, it updates labels and other values also dynamically generated on the page inside the slide event.p  pThe current answer shows how to configure multiple sliders, but uses only one slider declaration.  Im really looking for an answer that does the same thing but strongallows for each slider to be independently configuredstrong.

Negative 3280 pI have implemented the supporting of SAML SSO to have my application act as the Service Provider using Spring Security SAML Extension. I was able to integrate my SP with different IDPs. So for example I have strongHostA,HostB, and HostCstrong, all these have different instances of my application. I had an SP metadata file specified for each host and set the AssertionConsumerServiceURL with the URL of that host    EXhttpsHostA.commyappsamlsso    . strongI added each metadata file to the IDP and tested all of them and it is working fine.strongp  pstrongHowever, my project also supports High Availability by having an IBM HTTP Server configured for load balancing.strong So in this case the strongHTTP Server will configure the hostsA,B,Cstrong to be the hosts used for load balancing, the user will access the my application strongusing the URL of the HTTP server    httpshttpserver.commyappstrong    p  pstrongIf I defined one SP metadata file and had the URL of the HTTP Server specified in the AssertionConsumerServiceURL    a hrefhttpshttpserver.comsamlsso relnofollowhttpshttpserver.comsamlssoa    strong and changed my implementation to accept assertions targeted to my HTTP Server, strongwhat will be the outcome of this scenariostrongp  blockquote   ol   liUser accesses the HTTPServer which dispatched the user to HostAbehind the scenesli   liMy SP application in HostA sends a request to the IDP for authentication.li   liThe IDP sends back the response to my httpserver as    a hrefhttpshttpserver.comsamlsso relnofollowhttpshttpserver.comsamlssoa    .li   ol blockquote  pstrongWill the HTTP Server redirect to HostA, to have it like this     a hrefhttpsHostA.comsamlsso relnofollowhttpsHostA.comsamlssoastrongp  pThanks.p
Negative 3280 pI have read through many questions on SO on custom deleter for codesharedptrcode and codeuniqueptrcode, and the difference between the two. But, I still havent found any clear answer to this questionp  pHow can one best go about creating a type that acts as a codesharedptrcode with a custom deleter, similar to how codeuniqueptrcode has the deleter as part of the type definitionp  pFor codeuniqueptrcode usage, I use a deleter class, that handles deletion of individual types limiting it to just two types, for brevityp  precodestruct SDLDeleter                                    void operator SDLSurface ptr   if ptr SDLFreeSurface ptr     void operator SDLRWops ptr     if ptr SDLRWclose ptr     using SurfacePtr  stduniqueptrltSDLSurface, SDLDeletergt using RWopsPtr  stduniqueptrltSDLRWops, SDLDeletergt codepre  pWhich can be used with something likep  precodeSurfacePtr surfaceIMGLoadimage.png codepre  pAnd will call codeSDLFreeSurfacecode upon destruction.p  hr  pThis is all fine and well. However, how does one go about achieving the same for codesharedptrcode Its type is defined asp  precodetemplatelt class T gt class sharedptr codepre  pand the way to provide a custom deleter is through the constructor. It doesnt feel right that the user of the codesharedptrcode wrapper needs to know which pointer type is wrapped, and how that pointer is supposed to be deleted. What would be the best way to achieve the same kind of usage as with the codeuniqueptrcode example of above.p  pIn other words, that I could end up withp  precodeSurfaceShPtr surfaceIMGLoadimage.png codepre  pInstead of of something likep  precodeSurfaceShPtr surfaceIMGLoadimage.png,                      []SDLSurface ptrSDLFreeSurfaceptr codepre  pOr, just slightly betterp  precodeSurfaceShPtr surfaceIMGLoadimage.png,                      SDLDeleter codepre  hr  pIs there a way to do this, without having to create a RAII wrapper class instead of a typedef, adding even more overheadp  hr  pIf the answer is this isnt possible. Why notp

Negative 3280 pI am trying to figure out a way to emtemporarilyem i.e. during a single drag gesture disable scrolling on a codeUITableViewcode and then reenable it to have it pick up where it left off.p  pMy reason is I have a gesture recognizer that is monitoring the drag, and if the user drags their finger above the top of the table, I want to resize the table upwards with their finger, to a point, and then stop resizing and continue scrolling again.p  pNaturally, I dont want the table to scroll while it is resizing, because thats effectively achieving the scroll itself by moving the entire table view instead of the inner scrollable content, however I cant figure out how to do this in such a way that it allows the gesture to take effect again after a certain point or if the user drags back down over the table.p  pIs there a way to temporarily disableblock a gesture without causing it to fail or cancel outrightp  pPerhaps I could write a subclass of codeUITableViewcode that can intercept the gestures and ignore them as needed. What method should I override to do thisp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI ended up approaching this in a different way, which is to simply adjust the codecontentOffsetcode of the table view at each change of the gesture. I was afraid this might look jittery but it actually works quite smoothly. However Ill leave the question open as Im still curious if this can be done.p

Negative 3280 pThis is something that is frequently confusing me when I try to set up a project in Eclipse using Maven. I understand the basic directory structure imposed by Maven, but when I create a Maven project in Eclipse, it seems even more complicated and convoluted than Maven dictates. There are two almost identical versions of the whole directory. There is the srcmainjava... trail at the top, and then the folders are repeated again farther down. Lately Ive been working with a Spring project, and there are THREE copies of these directories one is under Java Resources, the next is under Deployed Resources, and its there again simply under the src folder. What is the purpose of this repetition If its possible to have these directories represented more simply, Id prefer that, but Eclipse presents an overwhelming variety of options for setting up a project. If Im using Luna Eclipse, Java, Spring and Maven, what is the SIMPLEST path to follow when creating a new project in a way that keeps this directory mess to a minimum p

Does the CSV need to be a file on the server and therefore I must convert the JSON response to a CSV file using say some PHP server side script Or would it make more sense to read in the JSON as a string object in javascript...then convert that to a CSV String and allow D3 to read the newly created CSV Stringp  pI can use AJAX to read in the JSON from the url and get the JSON using get.JSON... but how can I then make this available as CSV format for D3p

Negative 3280 pI have created and added a new filter to my TreeViewer object. It works fine but I cannot seem to understand when is the filterViewer,TreePath,Object[] called.p  pSo the filter is actually an instance of a class which extends ViewerFilter and needs to implement the abstract method select. In my case, select always returns true and I filter the elements by overriding the public Object[] filterViewer viewer, Object parent, Object[] elements.p  pHowever, when I try to override the public Object[] filterViewer viewer, TreePath parentPath, Object[] elements, this function doesnt get called at all.p  pHeres how it looksp  precode    myTreeViewer.addFilternew ViewerFilter              Override         public Object[] filterViewer viewer, TreePath parentPath, Object[] elements                       doesnt get called              return elements                   Override         public Object[] filterViewer viewer, Object parent, Object[] elements                       gets called normally              return elements                   Override         public boolean selectViewer arg0, Object arg1, Object arg2                       TODO Autogenerated method stub             return true               codepre  pI need to override the filter method with the TreePath argument in order to be afle to filter elements based on a specified level.p  pIn the documentation I could only find the following explanationp  blockquote   pFilters the given elements for the given viewer.

Negative 3280 pIm working on a stylesheet to transform tables similar to IETF i.e xhtml tables, but columnoriented, to xslfo.p  pOne of the first steps is to transform ltcol tags to ltfotablecolumn tags. Unfortunately for some reason the authors of the XSL 1.1 spec didnt provide a way to transfer all attributes automatically from ltfotablecolumn to the tablecells in the corresponding column, and the attributes with the exception of width dont apply automatically, either really dumb design decision, in my opinion  a hrefhttplists.w3.orgArchivesPublicxsleditors2001AprJun0031.html relnofollowhere is one of the Antenna House developers complaining about the same thing in 2001a.  Inheritance doesnt apply, either, as ltfotablecolumn doesnt have any children.p  pThis leaves me with the task of figuring out what formatting attributes have been set for each column and applying them by hand to the appropriate tablecells.  How best to do that, though  One thought I had was to place all the ltfotablecolumn nodes into a variable, but then how would I use xpath to process these nodes  The other thought is there must be a way to do this using a temporary result tree, but have never used anything like this and am clueless about whether not this is possible, and if it is, how one would work with a temporary result tree.  Im posting this question with labels XSLT 1.0 and XSLT 2.0 just to see if there strongisstrong an answer, but Im really constrained to using XSLT 1.0 for this problem.p  pstrongEditstrong  Someone requested a concrete example.

So, for example, for a table cell in the strong3rdstrong column of the table I would need to output the fo like thisp  precodeltfotablecell colorfromtablecolumn backgroundcolorfromtablecolumngt codepre  pand for a table cell in the strong4thstrong column I would need to outputp  precodeltfotablecell fontstylefromtablecolumn alignfromtablecolumn backgroundcolorfromtablecolumngt codepre  pThe question is how do you know which attributes to look for for the tablecells in a particular columnp

Negative 3280 pIm developing a Asp.Net MVC project that will be hosted in Amazon AWS, but I have some questions about storage of the clients files. The documentation from Amazon is not clear to me and Im looking for some directions and experiences here.p  p1  each client have a few files with low space disk requirements, low update frequency but very high access frequency like brand image and even sensitive files like certificates. Is appropriate to storage this files in appdata folder in web serverp  p2  the most critical to me are sensitive documents from hundreds to dozen of thousands per client, most like xml signed files. This files has a medium read access frequency but a very high demand for creation. One solution I found is MongoDB, wich give me some freedom to manage the storage policy and allow me a external backup easy, but Im not sure about that. Other options are to use the Amazon Storage and handle all this files and GBs in there with a lot of folders or maybe use a regular database and save the files as xml or bin.p  pMy concerns are about the amount of data, the security and the reliable in case of disaster as most of this documents has legal value.p

I have to complete the following problem.p  pstrong4.16 from Computation Physics 2nd Edition By Giordano and Nakanishistrong emCarry out a true threebody simulation in which the motions of Earth, Jupiter, and the Sun are all calculated. Since all three bodies are now in motion, it is useful to take the center of mass of the threebody system as the origin, rather than the position of Sun. We also suggest that you give Sun and initial velocity which makes the total momentum of the system exactly zeroso that the center of mass will remain fixed. Study the motion of Earth with different initial conditions. Also, try increasing the mass of Jupiter to 10, 100, and 1000 times its true mass.emp  pMy question Is it possible to write the code for the problem above, and then import that codeor the result into Adobe After Effects to model the threebody simulation My teacher has expressed that if i am able to do so, he would be inclined to give me extra credit, which i desperately need.p

Negative 3280 pI have the following setup There is a single client, multiple workers, and a single sink. The workers receive job requests from the client via a ZeroMQ message. They work on the input, and send the answer to another process sink. Processing a message takes about 1ms, and we need to process about 50,000 messagessec  which means we need more than 50 workers to handle the load.p  pI tried a simple setup, in which the client creates a single ZeroMQ PUSH socket, to which all the workers connect via a PULL socket. Similarly, the sink creates a single PULL socket to which all the workers connect with a PUSH socket.p  pIIUC, ZeroMQ sends the messages to workers using round robin  each time another worker gets the job. This setup seems to work efficiently enough with  10 workers and appropriate load. However, when increasing the number of workers and the load further, this breaks very quickly and the system starts to accumulate delays.p  pI know there are several patterns that take care of the load balancing problem, however they are geared towards multiple clients and require a router in between, which means additional code  cpu cycles. The question isp  p1 What would be the best pattern to use in case of single client, multiple workers, single sinkp  p2 Is it possible to do this without a router between the client and the workers, by routing on the client side insteadp  p3 What kind of ZeroMQ sockets should be usedp  pThanksp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comnl4I1.jpg altDiagramp  pEDIT Adding the code.p  pClientp  precode    void context  zmqctxnew         Socket to send messages on     void sender  zmqsocket context, ZMQPUSH     zmqbind sender, tcp5557        Socket to send start of batch message on     void sink  zmqsocket context, ZMQPUSH     zmqconnect sink, tcplocalhost5558      printf Press Enter when the workers are ready      getchar      printf Sending tasks to workersn        The first message is 0 and signals start of batch     ssend sink, 0      unsigned long i     const int nmsgs  atoiargv[1]     const int nmsgssec  atoiargv[2]     const int buffsize  1024  1KB msgs     unsigned long t, tstart     tstart  timestamp     for i  0 i lt nmsgs i              t  timestamp              Pace the sending according to nmsgssec             while i  1000000  t1tstart gt nmsgssec                       busy wait                     t  timestamp                          char buffer [buffsize]              Write current timestamp in the packet beginning             sprintf buffer, lu, t             zmqsend sender, buffer, buffsize, 0          printfTotal time lu ms Planned time d msn, timestamp  tstart1000, nmsgs  1000  nmsgssec      zmqclose sink     zmqclose sender     zmqctxdestroy context codepre  pWorkerp  precode  Socket to receive messages on void context  zmqctxnew  void receiver  zmqsocket context, ZMQPULL zmqconnect receiver, receiveraddr    Socket to send messages to void sender  zmqsocket context, ZMQPUSH zmqconnect sender, senderaddr    Process tasks forever const int buffsize  1024 char buffer[buffsize] while 1      zmqrecv receiver, buffer, buffsize, 0     ssend sender, buffer  zmqclose receiver zmqclose sender zmqctxdestroy context codepre  pSinkp  precode  Prepare our context and socket void context  zmqctxnew  void receiver  zmqsocket context, ZMQPULL zmqbind receiver, tcp5558    Wait for start of batch char string  srecv receiver free string  unsigned long t1 unsigned long maxdt  0 unsigned long sumdt  0  int tasknbr int nmsgs  atoiargv[1] printfnmsgs  dn, nmsgs for tasknbr  0 tasknbr lt nmsgs tasknbr      char string  srecv receiver     t1  timestamp     unsigned long t0  atollstring     free string      unsigned long dt  t1t0     maxdt  maxdt gt dt  maxdt  dt     sumdt  dt      iftasknbr  10000  0              printfd lun, tasknbr, dt        printfAverage time lu usectMax time lu usecn, sumdtnmsgs, maxdt  zmqclose receiver zmqctxdestroy context codepre

Negative 3280 pI am working on my first single page Angular.js application and am kind of stuck at programmatically compillingevaluating a custom directive in order to insert it into the DOM from within a controller.

Furthermore the following type error is thrownp  precodeTypeError scope.new is not a function codepre  pI tried to compile with different scopes, e.g. codescopecode of the controller or simply codetruecode to generate a new scope, but none will evaluate the expressions within the directive template.

Adding an onload event doesnt work either, but using a onclick event shows that everything is in place to work and most probably drawing starts before the DOM elements are actually created.p  pWhat is the best practice to make sure d3 generated DOM elements are created before starting assigning them content The third party JS library I use only requires the div id to draw content in.p  pFrom arrays of nodes and relationships return by Neo4j, I build a graph with d3 as follow. Images to be displayed in nodes are stored in the neo4j data base as Base64 strings.p  precode        var width  500, height  500          var div  d3.selectbody.appenddiv                .attrclass, tooltip             .styleopacity, 0          var col  obj.columns         var data  obj.data         var nodes  obj.data[0][0].nodes         var nodeMap           nodes.forEachfunctionx  nodeMap[x.label]  x           var edges  obj.data[0][0].edges          var links  edges.mapfunctionx             return  source nodeMap[x.source], target nodeMap[x.target], value x.value                    var svg  d3.selectgraph.appendsvg             .attrwidth, width             .attrheight, height             .attrpointerevents, all             .appendg             .calld3.behavior.zoom.onzoom, redraw             .appendg          var force  d3.layout.force             .gravity.3             .distance150             .charge4000             .size[width, height]          var drag  force.drag             .ondragstart, dragstart          force             .nodesnodes             .linkslinks             .friction0.8             .start          var link  svg.selectAll.link             .datalinks             .enter.appendline             .attrclass, link          var node  svg.selectAll.node             .datanodes             .enter.appendsvgg             .attrclass, node             .ondblclick, dblclick             .callforce.drag          node.appendcircle             .attrr, 50          node.appendimage              display structure in nodes             .attrxlinkhref, functiond                   if d.imgB64                      return dataimagepngbase64,   d.imgB64                                                  .attrx, 40             .attry, 40             .attrwidth, 80             .attrheight, 80          force.ontick, function              link.attrx1, functiond  return d.source.x                   .attry1, functiond  return d.source.y                   .attrx2, functiond  return d.target.x                   .attry2, functiond  return d.target.y              node.attrtransform, functiond  return translate  d.x  ,  d.y             codepre  pThat code works fine. Hence, what Im attempting to do is to replace the Base64 images with canvas drawings generated by a third party library.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comY9YsS.png altenter image description herep  pThis library works as followp  precodevar myCanvas  newCanvasViewerid, data codepre  pThis function knows how to generate an image from the given data and puts the result in the  DOM element, if the element already exists in the DOM, or generate a new canvas element in the DOM, directly in  but unfortunately erasing any other existing DOM elements.p  pSo, I changed the d3 above code, replacing the node.appendimage block withp  precodenode.appendcanvas     .attrid, functiond            var cnv  newCanvasViewerd.name, d.data           return d.name      codepre  pThis obviously doesnt work, canvas objects are displayed but not in the nodes, probably because the  DOM element doesnt exist yet when calling newCanvasViewer. Furthermore, the d3 graph is overwritten.  When setting an onclick function calling newCanvasViewer, the drawing shows up within the nodes on click.p  precodenode.appendcircle     .attrr, 50     .attronclick, functiond            return newCanvasViewerd.name, d.data       node.appendcanvas     .attrid, functiond            return d.name      codepre  pSince I would like each node to display its canvas drawing from start, I was wondering when to call the newCanvasViewer function I guess an oncreate function at each node would make it, but doesnt exist. Would a call back function work Should I call it once d3 is finished with the whole network drawingp  pIn order to be more comprehensive, here is the HTML and javascript code with callback function to attempt drawing canvas content once d3 d3 is done drawing. Im still stuck, the canvas sample is actually displayed but no canvas content show in nodes, probably due to timing between generating canvas containers and using them.p  pHTML p  precodeltbody onloadinit cypherQuerygt     ltdiv idgraph alignleft valigntopgtltdivgt     ltdiv idsamplegt         ltcanvas idmol stylewidth 160px height 160pxgtltcanvasgt     ltdivgt ltbodygt codepre  pJavascript in the HTML header      var xmlhttp     function init          xmlhttp  new XMLHttpRequest     p  precodefunction cypherQuery       perform neo4j query, extract JSON and call the network drawing d3.      ...     var obj  JSON.parsexmlhttp.responseText     drawGraphobj, drawCanvas       this is just to show that canvasViewer does the       job if the ltcanvas id...gt element exists in DOM      var nodes  obj.data[0][0].nodes     var cnv  newCanvasViewersample, nodes[0].data   function drawGraphobj, drawCanvas       see code above from...      var width  500, height  500      ... to      force.ontick, function          link.attrx1, functiond  return d.source.x               .attry1, functiond  return d.source.y               .attrx2, functiond  return d.target.x               .attry2, functiond  return d.target.y          node.attrtransform, functiond                return translate  d.x  ,  d.y                       function redraw          svg.attrtransform, translate  d3.event.translate     scale  d3.event.scale            node.attrfontsize, nodeFontSize  d3.event.scale  px           function dblclickd          d3.selectthis.classedfixed, d.fixed  false           if callback ampamp typeofcallback  function          callbacknodes       codepre

Negative 3280 pI am running a doctrine 1.2 application on a shared host. We have recently moved the site to a new host and the php memory limit is too low. PHP is running as CGI so I added the php.ini to my root and bumped up the memory limit, ran phpinfo and all ok. But when I try to go to my app it just goes into a loop and throws a Too many redirects error. I traced it to the first Doctrine query and doesnt matter what the query is, eg, execute, fetcharray etc, I still get the same issue. If I remove the php.ini file it goes back to normal but even if the php.ini file is empty, it still loops. It seems just the existence of the file causes doctrine to loop. p  pSo what could be causing this Does the php.ini file in the root somehow change the way php is handled p  pThe server is running php 5.4. Havent tested other versions.   p

Negative 3280 pI have a NSFetchedResultsController that gets me a collection of transactionesque objects that match a certain criteria  a sale over 100, for example. Each transaction has a unique integer identifier that corresponds to the relative time of the transaction transaction 23 came before transaction 24. I have no problem displaying the results in a UITableView Controller. What Id like to do is also show the transaction that occurred right before each of these sales over 100, i.e.p  pTransaction  93 id  1p  pTransaction  101 id  2p  pTransaction  12 id  13p  pTransaction  243 id  14 etc. p  pand then display this list of results in a TableView. There is no chance that two transactions over 100 happened after one another so there is no worry about duplicated entries. Is there any way to do this I was searching around on how to do this in SQL for inspiration, but there were only answers on how to get rows immediately before a given emindividualem result row, not a set of them. p  pAny ideasp

Negative 3280 pIn summary, my implementation of codeIAnnotationTransformer2code picks up a test method annotation and modifies it successfully, along with all other method annotation transformations.  Then at test execution time, the annotation value reverts to the hardcoded value, but only for the one method, not for any others. The other methods use the transformed values successfully.p  pDetailsp  pI have a TestNG test class codeServiceTestcode with a number of test methods 25. I also have a custom annotation codeQueryFilecode which takes a codelistcode parameter containing an array of codeStringcode which reference paths to text files containing parametersp  precodeServiceTest.java snippet, original  Test dataProviderQueryTests,groupsjson,api QueryFilelist     testinsertsmultiqueryjson.txt,     testselectsmultiqueryjson.txt  public void testWithMultipleQueriesString query throws...  codepre  pPreviously, as in the example above, the codelistcode values were hardcoded into the codeServiceTestcode class, with a separate set of paths for each method.p  pRecently, I have added a implementation of codeIAnnotationTransformer2code, codeQueryFileTransformercode, to load these paths from a properties file instead.  This makes the job of toggling test parameters on and off significantly easier e.g., I can just rename various versions of the properties files to the expected name and it gets picked up.p  pRevised ServiceTest.javap  precode revised ServiceTest.java snippet  Test dataProviderQueryTests,groupsjson,api QueryFilelist public void testWithMultipleQueriesString query throws... ...

In the example above, codetestWithJSONParamscode executes correctly with the values from the properties file, but codetestWithMultipleQueriescode executes with a null list, and is skipped.  When codetestWithMultipleQueriescode has a hardcoded list, it works fine.p  pSome factsp  ul liExecution is through maven surefire and failsafeli licodepreserveordertruecodeli lias stated above codeQueryFileTransformercode picks up the codetestWithMultipleQueriescode annotation and modifies it successfully, in the midst of all other transformations.  Then at test execution time, the annotation value appears to revert to the hardcoded value.li listepping through the eclipse debugger, it seems the transformation of codetestWithMultipleQueriescode occurs earlier than other method annotation transformations, but its not always first. Often it is intermingled with methods from other classes, which are listed first in the xml file, whereas the rest of the ServiceTest methods seem to transform in sequence.li liSpecifying the method as exclusive in the xml config file had no impact other than the expected of omitting the other methods execution.li listrongUPDATEstrong Further debugging implies the instance the test method passed to the codeDataProvidercode and its declared annotations is a different instance than the one with transformed annotations. This is not the case with the methods that succeed. li ul  pAny insight you can provide will be most helpful.p  pThanksp

Negative 3280 pI am almost sure that this cannot be done, but I will ask anyway. I have to use a C based library, which defines a numeric vector as array of floats, and lots of arithmetic functions to use them. I want to create a trivial class that can be easily casted to that type, with the addition of useful operators. Lets see a MWEp  pre classlangcpp prettyprintoverridecodeinclude ltiostreamgt  using vectortype  float[3]  class NewType  public     floatamp operator []stdsizet i  return v[i]      const floatamp operator []stdsizet i const  return v[i]       operator vectortypeamp   return v      vectortype operator amp   return ampv   private     vectortype v   int main      NewType t     t[0]  0.f t[1]  1.f t[2]  2.f      const vectortypeamp v  t     stdcout ltlt v ltlt v[0] ltlt , ltlt v[1] ltlt , ltlt v[2] ltlt  ltlt stdendl      return 0  codepre  pThis works flawlessly. The problem arises when we start using arrays. Lets write a new main functionp  pre classlangcpp prettyprintoverridecodeint main      constexpr stdsizet size  10     vectortype v1[size]                    OK     NewType v2[size]                        OK     vectortype v3  v2                    No way, NewType cannot be                                              converted to float [3]     vectortype v4          reinterpretcastltvectortypegtv2  OK      return 0  codepre  pThe codereinterpretcastcode works, but it makes the code less readable and the conversion between codevectortypecode and codeNewTypecode not transparent. As far as I know, it is not possible, according to C11 and C14 standards, to make the codeNewTypecode class implicitly emcastableem when using arrays. Is it completely true Are there any sort of caveats that allow this convertionp  pP.s. strongPlease, do not start commenting about the risks of using reinterpretcast and so on.strong I am aware of the risks, I know that the compiler could add some padding, and I already have some codestaticassertcode checks to avoid memory problems.p  p[Edit] I want to make the problem easier to understand. Lets make a different examplep  pre classlangcpp prettyprintoverridecodestruct originalvector      float x     float y     float z   class NewType  public originalvector  public      Useful functions here   codepre  pIf this would be my case, everything would be easy The type used in the C library would be codeoriginalvectorcode, and I could create a derived class and I could add any sort of method.p  pThe problem is that, in my real case, the codeoriginalvectorcode strongis not a classstructstrong, but a raw array And obviously, I cannot inherit it. Maybe now it is more clear the reason I am asking this question. p
Negative 3280 pIm wondering if anyone knows how to add a migration through c code.p  pIm kinda new to code first migrations.p  pIve been playing about with the codeToolingFacadecode class from codeSystem.Data.Entity.Migrations.Designcode.p  pWith this class I can detect migrations, update from one migration to another, detect pending migrations.

Negative 3280 pThe problem is given as follows Given a DAG and a number code0 lt p  1code, return the minimumcardinality set of vertices that disconnects at least a codepcodefraction of paths from a source i.e., no incoming arcs to a sink i.e., no outgoing arcs. For codep  1code, the problem is equivalent to minimum cut. For other values of codepcode, however, Im not sure what the answer will be.p  pAn algorithm Im thinking of is to first compute the mincut set for a DAG and then try to prune it to satisfy the criteria. This by itself is interesting to see if the subset that we find is actually the minimum cutset for the specific codepcode that is given. The problem with this algorithm is that it is wasteful, because it computes many nodes that we dont need in the final answer and in fact, is solving bigger problem in the first place.p  pAny pointers to the solution of this problem wouldnt it be possible that for some of the algorithms of mincut, we put this extra constraint as an earlystopping criterionp  pFor checking how many paths are removed, suppose we have indexed each vertex and will keep it updated if needed so that we know how many paths get disconnected by their removal. Please do not worry for the complexity of the index being updated. One last thing, there is no constraint on the resulting components in terms of size or anything.p
