Positive 27299 pI am writing javemeJava ME 3.2 MIDlet, where I use variables for Mode,Fan and Temperaturethis one is simple. When I send information to web API, i have to change them to Hex values, because API reads them as bits.

Positive 27299 pA provider is developing an android application and told me that SHA2 is not supported because they are using J2ME. Is this really true I did some google searching and didnt find anything about this.p  pAnother thing that worry me is that they are using J2ME to develop an Android application. Is this a good idea Isnt more secure to develop using native Android and not Java Microeditionp  pThanks in advance.p  pBestp

Positive 27299 pIm a noob to j2me. I have an app. where I would like to use multiple commandAction methods in each class. For example one form belongs to one class which uses a commandAction method to go to a list, which is in another class, whereby the list in the different class has another commandAction method to jump to another form. I tried running the application, but it seems the only responsive commandAction method is the one in the first form. Can j2me use multiple commandAction methods in different classes on the same app, or do I have to use the same method for the whole app, because that too may cause an error if the method is too big P.S. I tried using one commandAction method for the entire app, and it works, but if I try use the method on different classes, nothing happens, as though the commandlistener has not been set, yet it hasp

For our first year weve been using a server for sharing project files, a plain windows machine with a network share. But this isnt exactly future proof. p  pSVN is great for code its what we use now, but I want to have the comfort of versioning or atleast some form of syncing for all or most of our files. p  pemWhat I essentially want is something that does what subversion does for code, but for our documentspsdpdf files.em p  pI realize subversion handles binary files too, but I feel it might be a bit overkill for our purposes.

Negative 27299 pFirst off, a quick rundown of what the code is doing. I have two tables Companies and Clients. There is a one to many relationship between Companies and Clients one company can have many clients.p  pIn some processing logic, I have both tables loaded into a DataSet  each are DataTables. I have added a DataRelation to set the relationship, and it works when I use GetChildRows on  a record from the Companies table.p  pHowever, I need to sort the records returned. After googling around some it looks like the DataViewManager is the way to go, and I have examined several basic examples. However, I cannot get my rows sorted. Am I missing something, or am I not using this how it is supposed to be used Example codep  precodeDim ldvmManager As New DataViewManagermdsData ldvmManager.DataViewSettingsCompanies.Sort  comName ASC ldvmManager.DataViewSettingsClients.ApplyDefaultSort  False ldvmManager.DataViewSettingsClients.Sort  entLastName ASC, entFirstName ASC  For Each mdrCurrentCompany in ldvmManager.DataViewSettingsCompanies.Table.Rows     Dim ldrClients as DataRow  mdrCurrentCompany.GetChildRowsCompaniesClients Next codepre  pNo matter what I do, the first Client returned has a last name that starts with a B and the second has one that starts with a A. From there, the order is all mixed up. If I use my entire data instead of the subset I was using to test with, the first Client returned has a last name that starts with J. It seems like it is still using whatever default sort was being used before I tried to use the DataViewManager.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 27299 pSometimes, while sending a large amount of data via SocketChannel.write, the underlying TCP buffer gets filled up, and I have to continually retry the write until the data is all sent.p  pSo, I might have something like thisp  precodepublic void sendByteBuffer bb, SocketChannel sc    sc.writebb    while bb.remaininggt0       Thread.sleep10       sc.writebb                codepre  pThe problem is that the occasional issue with a large ByteBuffer and an overflowing underlying TCP buffer means that this call to send will block for an unexpected amount of time.  In my project, there are hundreds of clients connected simultaneously, and one delay caused by one socket connection can bring the whole system to a crawl until this one delay with one SocketChannel is resolved.  When a delay occurs, it can cause a chain reaction of slowing down in other areas of the project, and having low latency is important.p  pI need a solution that will take care of this TCP buffer overflow issue transparently and without causing everything to block when multiple calls to SocketChannel.write are needed.  I have considered putting send into a separate class extending Thread so it runs as its own thread and does not block the calling code.  However, I am concerned about the overhead necessary in creating a thread for EACH socket connection I am maintaining, especially when 99 of the time, SocketChannel.write succeeds on the first try, meaning theres no need for the thread to be there.  In other words, putting send in a separate thread is really only needed if the while loop is used  only in cases where there is a buffer issue, perhaps 1 of the time  If there is a buffer issue only 1 of the time, I dont need the overhead of a thread for the other 99 of calls to send.p  pI hope that makes sense... I could really use some suggestions.  Thanksp

Negative 27299 pIn short How to reliably discover a server running somewhere on a presumably multisegmented local area network with zero client configurationp  pMy client application has to locate the server application without knowing the server IP address. It has to work on a local LAN that may be split into segments with hubs or other switching devices.p  pI already have a working solution, but it is a bit cumbersome to get it working on multisegment networks. It works as followsp  pWhen the client starts up, it sends UDP broadcasts on its own network segment. If the server is running on the same segment, it works without any issues  the server responds with the appropriate messages.p  pIf the server and client are running on networks separated by a hub  switch that wont forward UDP the most likely case, then I have a server instance running on each segment, and they forward client requests to each other via TCP  but I need to configure this for the server instances simple, but still a pain for tech support. This is the main problem that I need to address. There are sites where we have hundreds of clients running on 5 or 6 separate segments.p  pThe problems Im facing 1. Although my application installer enables the appropriate ports on the firewall, sometimes I come across situations where this doesnt seem to happen correctly. 2. Having to run multiple server instances and therefore configure and maintain them on hubswitched networks that wont forward UDPp  pFinally I need a solution that will work without maintenance on a minimal Windows network XP  2000  Vista that probably doesnt have Active Directory or other lookup services configured.p  pI dont want to tag on any runtime stuff for this  should be able to do it with plain VC or Delphi.p  pWhat approaches do commercial apps usually take I know that SQL Server uses a combination of broadcast and NetBEUI calls I may be wrong about this.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 27299 pBasically, I have two tables, Table A contains the actual items that I care to get out, and Table B is used for language translations.p  pSo, for example, Table A contains the actual content. Anytime text is used within the table, instead of storing actual varchar values, ids are stored that relate back to text stored in Table B. This allows me to by adding a languageID column to Table B, have multiple translations for the same row in the database.p  pExamplep  h2Table Ah2  ul liTitle int li liDescription intli liOther Data....li ul  h2Table Bh2  ul liTextID int  This is the column whose value is stored in other tablesli liLanguageID intli liText varcharli ul  pMy question is more a call for suggestions on how to best handle this. Ideally I want a query that I can use to select from the table, and get the text as opposed to the ids of the text out of the table. Currently when I have two text items in the table this is what I dop  precodeSELECT C.ID, C.Title, D.Text AS Description FROM SELECT A.ID, A.Description, B.Text AS Title FROM TableA A, TranslationsTable B WHERE A.Title  B.TextID AND B.LanguaugeID  1 C LEFT JOIN TranslationsTable D ON C.Description  D.TextID AND D.LanguaugeID  1 codepre  pThis query gives me the row from Table A I am looking for using where statements in the inner select statement with the actual text based on the language ID used instead of the text ids.p  pThis works fine when I am only using one or two text items that need to be translated, but adding a third item or more, it starts to get really messy  essentially another left join on top of the example.p  pAny suggestions on a better query, or at least a good way to handle 3 or more text items in a single rowp  pPer suggestions, Ive added an example of the two tablesp  precode    Table A            ID    Title    Description              1     1        2              2     3        4              Table B Translations Table           ID    LanguaugeIDText              1     1        Here is title one            1     2        Here is a title one in espanol          2     1        Here is description one            2     2        Here is description one in espanol          3     1        Title 2            4     1        Description 2         codepre  pWhat I want is to be able to pull a row out of table A that already has the text from table B, not just the ids  and to be able to do this for several columns that need translations.p

Im using SQL Server Table configuration to pull a value from a table and populate a variable. My Database connection string is passed in at runtime so this should be taken care of in the production environment. There are no errors, but the value is not retrieved and the variable remains blank it is actually a path, so I get a file not found as the path is blank.p  pThe package works on my machine.

Negative 27299 pWe are currently working on a Salesforce.com custom APEX project that involves a lot of  apex classes, triggers and Visualforce pages. We also have numerous applications from AppExchange that are part of the system.p  pWe develop all the Apex Classes, Visualforce pages, etc in test environment and then deploy it to the live environment using Eclipse IDE.

The route currently looks something like thisp  precoderemovemembership   url      groupmembershipgroupidpersonid   class    sfPropelRoute   options   model GroupMembership, type object    param     module groupMembers, action remove    requirements     sfmethod [delete] codepre  pTo perform this action, the user needs to be logged in, so I restricted it using sfGuard in the modules security.ymlp  precoderemove   issecure true codepre  pSo after clicking a remove link, a user who isnt logged in is taken to the log in screen, but after clicking submit the request is no longer a delete but a get, meaning the similar addtogroup route is called insteadp  precodeaddtogroup   url    groupmembershipgroupidpersonid   param   module groupMembers, action create    ... codepre  pIs there any way to make sfGuard emulate a delete action and pass the parameters properly, or will I have to use a different routep
Negative 27299 pGood evening.p  pStraight to the point  I would need a script that grabs RDFJSON structure from specific time interval in WEBVTT file. Does such a thing existp  pRDFJSON is Talis specified file structure that looks like thisp  precode S   P  [ O ]   codepre  pWEBVTT implements mentioned structure like thisp  precode0 000000,000 gt 000046,119  S   P  [ O ]    1 000048,000 gt 000050,211  S   P  [ O ]    ... codepre  pAnd I would use such file while viewing the video files in such way that when I click on some part of the timeline, script fetches corresponding RDFJSON code Im able to do this now, there is a WEBVTT parser already, and then parser fetches requested information in the object from the RDFJSON structure.p  pI was really happy when I saw that jQuery has getJson implemented, but it works only for normal json files.p  pThe best thing would probably be to just write the script, but my timing and knowledge are very limited, so I would like to hear any suggestion or solution that anybody might know.p

Negative 27299 pI know that Eclipse will not allow a library to be run, but that seems like an unnecessary and unfortunate restriction to me.

Negative 27299 pI am using com.sun.httpserver.HttpServer and javax.xml.ws.Endpoint to publish a JAXWS web service, which was generated by running wsimport on an existing WSDL and implementing the genereated service interface.  All this was part of JDK 1.6 JAXWS RI 2.1.6.  My web service, running as a Java program without an additional Web container is supposed to simulate an existing SOAP service that was implemented using Apache Axis, running on Tomcat.  Existing clients are likewise implemented using Apache Axis.p  pThe problem I am having is that Soap operation calls from the clients to my JAXWS service hang for a while, and then end with socket timeout on the clients side.  This occurs even though the JAXWS service is returning the SOAP response right away.p  pInspecting the packets with tcpdump and wireshark, I noticed that with the existing Axis web service, after the SOAP response is sent from the server to the client, the server sends a FIN ACK packet, to which the clients responds with FIN ACK.  This concludes all packets pertinent to the SOAP operation.  On the other hand, when running with the JAXWS service, the server does not send a FIN ACK after the SOAP response is sent to the client.  And the client seems to continue reading the socket input stream for it.p  pThis leads me to believe that the JAXWS web service stack is somehow keeping the socket open, even after the response to a SOAP call has been sent.  And it appears that the client is expecting the socket to close at the end of a SOAP operation.  Unfortunately, I cannot modify the client to behave differently.p  pstrongIs there a way to configure the Endpoint or the HttpServer instances    that I am using to publish the JAXWS service to always close a    socket after each SOAP operationstrongp  pI tried setting the system property http.keepAlive to false, but this did not seem to make any difference.p  pThanks in advance for your help.p

Negative 27299 pI have a web application that impersonates using the Win32 API. I recently returned from a trip to find the part of the application that impersonates failing.p  pThe reason for the impersonation is that there is a network share that is used for a specific purpose. When my web application accesses that network share, it must impersonate a special account. For the sake of discussion, the uid is Bob, the password is 1234, and the domain is home.p  pTwo weeks ago, I wrote my program to use the Win32 API to impersonate Bob and all was well. Now, the Win32 API indicates logon failure. Im having trouble figuring out what could have changed.  bTo be specific, the server indicates that it fails to impersonate Bob.  The error occurs before the server actually tries to access a network share.bp  pThe bizarre thing is that if I connect to my web server with MSTSC, I can click on Map Network Drive in the Windows Explorer and access the files using Bobhome and password 1234. bI enter the uid and password by clicking on Connect using a different user name in the Map Network Drive dialogbp  pIt seems that something different must be happening when I try to access my network share with impersonation versus using the Windows Explorer.p  pWhat is that differencep  pbUpdateb I feel like the answer to this problem is that there is some sort of logon permission that is being denied that is somehow not involved when I access my files through Windows Explorer.p

Negative 27299 pem[Cross posted from the Database Administrators site, in the hope that it may gain better traction here.

This is close to the elapsed time. However, in SQL Management Studio the statistics show a much lower CPU time, as Id expect eg. 6828 ms. The query takes some time to return, because of the slowness of the server it is talking to, but it doesnt return many rows.p  pIm aware of the issue that parallel queries in SQL Server 2005 can present odd CPU times, which is why Ive tried to turn off any parallism with the query hint though I really dont think that there was any in any case.p  pI dont know how to account for the fact that the two ways of looking at CPU usage can differ, nor which of the two might be accurate I have other reasons for thinking that the CPU usage may be the higher number, but its tricky to measure. Can anyone give me a steerp  pstrongUPDATEstrong I was assuming that the problem was with the OPENQUERY so I tried looking at times for a longrunning query which doesnt use OPENQUERY. In this case the statistics gained by setting STATISTICS TIME ON reported the CPU time at 3315ms, whereas the DMV gave it at 0.511ms. The total elapsed times in each case agreed.p

Negative 27299 pIm creating a web platform destined to the customers of a certain company. The company requires that the platform allows the streaming of videos.p  pIts important to note that the company will be the one to add the videos to the platform, dinamically, from a software built by me for that purpose, and each video will be referenced on a sql server table.p  pIve never done streaming before so Im asking 2 thingsp  pThe first is about some guidance in silverlight streamingtutorials, articles, examples, etcp  pThe other is my main concern. I have a few video samples from the company, and all of them are over 200 MBytes and can go up to 2GB, so I know I have to reencode them to become smaller. But, how do I do this... I mean, do I have to reenconde them, manually, one at a time, or is there a way to do it automatically as a new video is added p  pI have Expression Studio Encoder 4 pro, but never really used it, and as far as I can tell, I have to manually add each video to do the enconding. Again... is there a way to do this dinamicallyp  pThanksp

Negative 27299 pI am attempting to write a Ruby script that will look at a collection of unstructured plain text files and I am struggling with thinking through the best way to process these files. The current working version of my script for topic modeling is the followingp  precodeusrbinenv ruby w  require rubygems require ldaruby   Input a directory of files FILESDIRECTORY  ARGV[0]  File.openfiles.csv, w do f   Dir.globFILESDIRECTORY  .txt do filename     fileid  File.basenamefilename.gsub.txt,      text  File.readfilename.clean     f.puts [fileid, text].join,   end end   Read csv file  File.openfiles.csv, r  f f.read    Train topics and infer corpus  LdaCorpus.new corpus.adddocumentLdaTextDocument.newcorpus, file  lda  LdaLda.newcorpus lda.verbose  false lda.numtopics  20 lda.emrandom topics  lda.topwords10  puts topics codepre  pWhat Im attempting to modify is having this program read through a collection of plain text files rather than a single file. Its not as easy as just tossing all the text files into a single file as it currently does with codefiles.csvcode because, as I understand it, ldaruby looks for multiple files to do a correct topic model rather than a single file. Ive come to this conclusion because there is little variance between having this script read a single text file [e.g., codecorpus.txtcode] that includes all the text, and the codefiles.csvcode file.p  pSo, my question is how can I have ldaruby iterate through these text files differently Should the contents of the files be placed into a hash instead If so, any pointers on where I should start with that Or, should I scrap this and use a different LDA libraryp  pThanks ahead of time for any advice.p

In my solution I have 2 projectsp  ol liA Website project that contains an AppGlobalResources folder where most of my resources reside build action content.li liA utility project, compiled as class library that the website references, where I need another set of resources called ExceptionMessages hereafter.li ol  pemNota each project uses its own resources, there is no cross linking involved here.emp  pI added a new resource directly in my second project both as content or embeded resource and tried to access it via codeExceptionMessages.Tagcode. Intellisense is happy about it and correctly suggests the Tag but I get the following error at runtimep  blockquote   pCould not find any resources appropriate for the specified culture or   the neutral culture.  Make sure   Resources.ExceptionMessages.resources was correctly embedded or   linked into assembly AppGlobalResources.lqgd5zqy at compile time,   or that all the satellite assemblies required are loadable and fully   signed.p blockquote  pSomehow, I dont understand why the webserver is looking for the resource in the AppGlobalResources instead of directly in the assembly where it is used... or how I could go around this in a clean way. Any hint or ideap  pThanksp

Negative 27299 pI have developed a java application in Netbeans 7.1.2 that uses different swing controls like combobox, jcalendar for taking date input from user textfields for inputs from user, command button for doing calculation in code etc. and finally display result in textfield. The program also uses a derby data table while doing calculations. Using SQL statements i am executing some queries based on user input. The application works absolutely fine.p  pNow, I want to make a standalone mobile application of this project. Considering the controls that i am using above what is the appropriate source package and file that I should be looking for in the mobile application project I dont mind building the GUI again and putting the code in it as its not much of a work but if I can use the already built application as it is then its well and good.p  pAfter a bit of google, I have tried opening a mobile application in Java ME and open a JAVA Package right clickNewJava Package, here I tried with right clickNew Visual MIDlet, JFrame Form, A GUI Xlet form etc. But none of them seem to have swing controls. The pallette shows beans, java persistence and jcalendar only.p  pAm I supposed to addload controls from some jar file or Does the mobile application not support swing controls in such a case how can I generate my GUI using something elsesimilar I have tried copy pasting from my earlier form design into a new JFrame form but the source code is red all over and errors like codejava.awt.event.actionEvent does not existcode are appearing on all controls in the code. Am I supposed to import something here p  pThe application is meant for both, smart phones with full wide touch screens and simple phones with small screens where I may have to change the interface by breaking it into smaller bits for taking user input one by one and loading them one after another. But right now I want some suggestions for the full GUI for widescreen smartphones. p  pThe reason I am using JAVA ME is because I feel then it can be deployed on any phone irrespective of its OS. Please correct me if I am wrong and enlighten me.p

Negative 27299 pSuppose I am running a TURN server bound to a public IP say 100.0.0.1. When the server creates a relay port for a create allocation request, is it ever the case that the server would send back an IP address that is different from whatever it is bound to 100.0.0.1 in this case in the XORRELAYEDADDRESS attribute Im not familiar enough with networking to know all possible scenarios, and the a hrefhttptools.ietf.orghtmlrfc5766section6.2 relnofollowRFC 5766a doesnt really say anything specific as far as I can tell.p  pPhrased another way, is the IP address in the XORRELAYEDADDRESS redundant In all cases I have considered, the client only needs to know the port allocated, and could completely ignore the IP of XORRELAYEDADDRESS. As long as the client knows the relay port, it can always send relay data to the TURN server public IP it already knows the IP since it had to connect initially... at the relay port.p  pAny commentsp

Negative 27299 pIm working on someones website thats managed using Joomla 1.5.26, and am finding all sorts of problems. In various places, there are multiple redirects when clicking a link or submitting a form, and I cant figure out why. The site was worked on by people before me and its definitely the changes they made that are causing it, but I have very little experience in Joomla and dont know where to start. p  pIm currently trying to figure out why a link is redirecting the way it is. Its a menu option on one of the side navigations and leads to a page that, for some reason, lacks the beginning html, body, head, etc. tags. At the bottom of this page are html and head tags, the head tag containing a meta tag for an http refresh. This links to a page with the same url but with the addition of codefid367code. Ive found what they changed thats causing the redirect, so Im trying to backtrack to figure out how to avoid the need to redirect. Im first trying to understand why the beginning html tags arent showing up, but, as I said, Im not sure where to start with Joomla.p  pApart from starting over, are there any debugging toolsmethods that would help me As organized as Joomla is, its still hard to navigate the various includes and function calls that happen all over the place. p

Negative 27299 pI am trying to create a 2D list in Python. I found two possibilities.p  precodedef cArraysize     c  [[0. for i in rangesize] for j in rangesize]     return c  def npArraysize     np  numpy.zerossize,size     return np codepre  pNow both of these functions give the correct answer. The problem here is with the performance. I ran both of these using timeit, and here are my resultsp  precodelist size is 5000 number of times run is 5  cArray average time 3.73241295815 npArray average time 0.210782241821 codepre  pSo obviously, I would like to avoid the first solution, especially since this will be running for sizes up to 100k. However, I also do not want to use too many dependencies. Is there a way for me to efficiently create a 2D array, without numpy It doesnt need to be exactly up to speed, as long as its not 17 times slower.p
Negative 27299 pIm currently developing a web application that will use Facebook as a authentication service. Does it make sense to implement it as an ASP.NET Forms Authentication custom membership provider While I made my research, I didnt come across any concrete significant advantage of using the Forms Authentication. However, it instinctively seems to me as a good thing to do, because aside from creating a completely custom implementation of authentication using Facebook, I didnt find any extensibility point inside ASP.NET where I could plug in the Facebook auth behavior.p  pCan you then tell me whether the Forms Authentication is a good idea or not. And if not, is there any other way than completely custom code Id like to avoid managing the session cookies, loading the current user, etc. manually.p  pIm using ASP.NET MVC 3, Entity Framework and Id like to avoid the Facebook C SDK the extensive use of dynamic types is a bit of a turnoff for me  .p  pThanks for any advice.p

ExtJS The latest version is a MVC based framework based on Yahoo YUI, it supports the     concepts of MVC in JavaScript and is a well tiered framework with good extendibility and support. 2.  ExtJS has good documentation and active forums. 3.  It comes in both paid and free version , offers paid support also. 4.  ExtJS 4.x has got a major revamp from design perspective and improved in terms of performance  5.  To be comfortable in Extjs , if is required to have a good knowledge of JavaScript  6.  If you have to use a good MVC framework in enterprise application use ExtJS  7.  There is greater learning curve in case of ExtJS   jQuery  1.  jQuery provides a good library with css based selectors promoted by Microsoft 2.  jQuery also has good documentation and forum support 3.  jQuery is open source ,you can make your own plugins and contribute 4.  jQuery is quite lighter and fast in terms of performance .It does not follow the MVC framework , the code sometimes appears cluttered when really complex. 5.  jQuery is easy to understand as it is based on css selectors , follows the rules like css quite similar 6.  For common tasks in JavaScript it is the most suitable framework, well suitable for ASAP projects. 7.  The learning curve is not that big, it is quiet easy to grasp, even in case of novice developers. codepre  pPlease feel free to add details , if i missed something Thanks Abhip

Negative 27299 pI have an issue with a project that includes another project.  The second project is an SDK which is required for the main project.  At the moment, I have the SDK included in the main project as a static library.  Both the SDK and the main project include the FBConnect and Unofficial Twitter SDK frameworks.  I believe my problems are a result of these frameworks being included in both projects, but I have been unable to find a way to have them coexist without errors.  p  pWhen the project builds for debug, it will not build for archive, and vice versa.  I am able to resolve the issues each time by performing the same steps, but I would like to find a way to resolve it with no steps required between debug and archive builds.p  pWhen the project builds for debug without any errors, I get the following when trying an archive buildp  precodeUndefined symbols for architecture armv7   OBJCCLASSSBJSON, referenced from       objcclassref in FBRequest.o       objcclassref in libSDK.aApiTvDiscussView.o       objcclassref in libSDK.aApiWebView.o ld symbols not found for architecture armv7 clang error linker command failed with exit code 1 use v to see invocation codepre  pI then add the implementation files for the SBJSON library used by the FBConnect framework into the Compile Sources in Build Phases of the target, as per the linked screenshot a hrefhttpd.priVT55 relnofollowScreenshotap  pThis then produces a different issue, as belowp  precode    duplicate symbol OBJCMETACLASSOAHMACSHA1SignatureProvider in         UsersAlanLibraryDeveloperXcodeDerivedDataAppgpvfsbaxxbvhsddtcbgkggquyltlBuildIntermediatesArchiveIntermediatesAppIntermediateBuildFilesPathApp.buildReleaseiphoneosApp.buildObjectsnormalarmv7OAHMACSHA1SignatureProvider.o .libSDK.aOAHMACSHA1SignatureProvider.o      .     .     .     .     .      duplicate symbol OBJCCLASSTwitterDialog in         UsersAlanLibraryDeveloperXcodeDerivedDataAppgpvfsbaxxbvhsddtcbgkggquyltlBuildIntermediatesArchiveIntermediatesAppIntermediateBuildFilesPathApp.buildReleaseiphoneosApp.buildObjectsnormalarmv7TwitterDialog.o         .libSDK.aTwitterDialog.o     duplicate symbol OBJCMETACLASSTwitterDialog in         UsersAlanLibraryDeveloperXcodeDerivedDataAppgpvfsbaxxbvhsddtcbgkggquyltlBuildIntermediatesArchiveIntermediatesAppIntermediateBuildFilesPathApp.buildReleaseiphoneosApp.buildObjectsnormalarmv7TwitterDialog.o         .libSDK.aTwitterDialog.o     ld 43 duplicate symbols for architecture armv7     clang error linker command failed with exit code 1 use v to see invocation codepre  pRemoving the implementation files for the OAUTH library used by the Unofficial Twitter SDK framework from the Compile Sources in Build Phases of the target removes these errors and the project archive build is successful. p  pWhen I attempt to build the project for debug, I get the opposite of these errors, firstly the OAUTH library symbols are undefined.  Adding them to compile sources resolves the issue, then the SBJSON symbols are duplicated. Removing them from compile sources allows the debug build to complete successfully.  p  pDoes anyone know of a way to have these coexist in harmony so that I can do both debug and archive builds of the project without this file juggling every timep

Negative 27299 pI was thinking ... when I code a web app using codeBackbone.jscode, most of the time I duplicate the models  one version for the backend in language codeXcode, using ORM codeYcode, one for the frontend using Backbone.

Negative 27299 pI have very simple web site which is actually single page, there is one input field and a button.br I need to store data submitted by users somewhere on server side. Perfect way could be simple text file and new lines appended to it after each button click. Log file will be also ok.br As I understand it is not possible with JavaScript itself. Im looking for emeasiest solutionem, preferably with no serverside programming but if it is required, it should be as easy as possible and work outofbox. I can use some side service if it could be helpful.br Please help.br Thanks in advance.   p  pUPD. Just want to rephrase the main question. I do not really need to store something on server side. I need to collect some input from users. Is it possible It would also be ok if it for example will be just sent to my email.p

Negative 27299 pSuppose I have a class Person with the following properties and methodsp  ul licodepublic string FirstNamecodeli licodepublic string LastNamecodeli licodepublic House CurrentHousecodeli licodepublic void BuildHousestring streetAddresscodeli ul  pHouse is a separate class with some simple properties like street address.p  pWhen I first create a codePersoncode object, I databind a WPF window to it.  Person starts out with a codeFirstNamecode and codeLastNamecode, but their codeCurrentHousecode is null.  This is a stupid example but for the sake of argument lets say the person has to build a house before they can live in it.  Databinding to codeFirstNamecode and codeLastNamecode works as expected.p  pNow lets say I want to move this person into a house.  The logic looks something likep  precodepublic void BuildHousestring streetAddress      this.CurrentHouse  new House              StreetAddress  streetAddress       codepre  pMy data context for the WPF window is this person object.  I have a label that shows the persons address bound to codeMyPerson.CurrentHouse.StreetAddresscode with an codeUpdateSourceTriggercode of codePropertyChangedcode.  When I first show the screen the codeCurrentHousecode object is null and the label is blank expected behavior.  However when I call codeBuildHouse123 anywhere stcode, I expect the databound label to have its value changed to 123 anywhere st.p  pThis is not whats happening and Im starting to suspect its because when the window is initially open, the CurrentHouse property for the databound codePersoncode object  is null.  Are my suspicions correct  If so, what do I need to do to enable databinding on the label once the CurrentHouse object is no longer null p

Negative 27299 pThis is a very particular question so any input will be appreciated...p  pIm using panels and views in a custom view template file in a drupal 7 site. The panel has a view embedded in it, as well as some extra content beneath. I have the view set with 3 contextual filters having taxonomy term pulled from url. This is working fine. So if I go to something likep  precodesearchfordred codepre  pIt will successfully pull all items having taxonomy term ford that also have taxonomy term red applied.p  pBut interestingly enough, if I change one of the terms to something that exists in the vocabulary, but does not happen to have any relation to items that successfully pass the first criteria, it will just load the site wrapper with the panel blank. No errors of any kind, search filter box disappears, pagination disappears, even the other content embedded in the view disappears.p  pIt doesnt seem to matter what I choose for Action to take if filter value does not validate for any or all of the filters applied to the view. I tried to set it to show no results, but I assumed it didnt apply since I am also using a custom template file for the view.p  pI expect it to show no results. But I also expect it to have the search bar up top so the user can select a different filter from the menu, as well as the other content embedded in the view.p  pThe search box is custom to the view template file. The only reason it would not show is if the view itself does not load. In this case it looks like the whole panel is not showing.p  pFeel free to ask for specifics if this is not enough to go on. Thanks.p

Negative 27299 pI want to speed up an import of a very large xml file into my mysql db, I decided to dump all the queries into a SQL file and execute it on console so its a bit faster.p  pBut my problem is that I cannot simply insert all the data.p  pSome tables are linked, thats the reason why i cannot use the very fast codeLOAD DATA INFILEcode feature. So I want to put the queries in a SQL file, but i need some control operations.p  pI have a data set I need its ID as primary key to be able to add data in another table using that ID.p  pSo what I tried via mysql console is thisp  precodeINSERT IGNORE INTO tableA VALUES  A, B, C SET id  LASTINSERTID IF id, SELECT 1, SELECT id INTO id FROM tableA WHERE aA and bB and cC INSERT INTO tableB VALUES  id, B, C codepre  pObviously the IF statement doesnt work, it works only with SELECT IF.p  pWhat im trying to do is to add a dataset into tableA using INSERT IGNORE, so duplicate errors are ignored. If it adds a new row, i get my id with LASTINSERTID, if there is a duplicate id is empty, but with my IF check i select THAT duplicate and put it INTO a, so in any case i have the id set. then i use id to put my data into tableB so i have the correct linking.p  pIs there any possibility to do this workflow with IF Since I cannot create a simple CSV to use LOAD DATA INFILE because of my linked tables for which I need to do some checks, I think generating SQL is the best.p  pMy XML file is like 2025GB large. My perl script works like 3 weeks to import into the database doing all the checks, but is very slow because of all the mysql queries I do, I want to put all the queries in one file and put it into the DB with one shot. If i could control my query flow I could create that big sql file instead of running millions of queries with all the checks in my perl script.p  pPlease tell me that this is possible.p

Negative 27299 pOkay, so Im trying to make a Wheel of Fortune type of effect with a wheel shape in iOS, where I can grab and spin a wheel. I can currently drag and spin the wheel around to my hearts content, but upon releasing my finger, it stops dead. I need to apply some momentum or inertia to it, to simulate the wheel spinning down naturally.p  pIve got the velocity calculation in place, so when I lift my finger up I codeNSLogcode out a velocity between a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 100, which ranges from anywhere between 1 and over 1800 at my hardest flick, now Im just trying to establish how I would go about converting that velocity into an actual rotation to apply to the object, and how Id go about slowing it down over time.p  pMy initial thoughts were something like begin rotating full circles on a loop at the same speed as the velocity that was given, then on each subsequent rotation, slow the speed by some small percentage. This should give the effect that a harder spin goes faster and takes longer to slow down.p  pIm no mathematician, so my approach may be wrong, but if anybody has any tips on how I could get this to work, at least in a basic state, Id be really grateful. Theres a really helpful answer here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9624804iphoneaddinertiamomentumphysicstoanimatewheeloffortunelikerotatingiPhone add inertiamomentum physics to animate quotwheel of fortunequot like rotating controla, but its more theoretical and lacking in practical information on how exactly to apply the calculated velocity to the object, etc. Im thinking Ill need some animation help here, too.p  pEDIT Im also going to need to work out if they were dragging the wheel clockwise or anticlockwise.p  pMany thanksp
Negative 27299 pWe are in the process of moving our project from LLVM GCC to Apple LLVM. One of the libraries we have is built only for arm and not i386.

Negative 27299 h1The question itself.h1  pIm currently developing a realtime image recognition software with MATLAB, and Im having some trouble trying to speed up the frame rates with my webcam. Even when I process only a fraction of the image using a ROI to crop it it doesnt speed up the frame rate by much. p  pThat lead me to believe that my computations in every frame or the size of them, to be more specific arent the problem. So, looking for an answer, I made the simple codep  precodeimaqreset   Turn the webcam on with a MJPG6480x480 acquisition format. webcam1  videoinputwinvideo,1,MJPG640x480 setwebcam1,FramesPerTrigger,1 setwebcam1,TriggerRepeat,Inf triggerconfigwebcam1,Manual startwebcam1   Preallocate for the variable wich will hold the frame rates over time. a  zeros1,100   Acquire frames in a loop and saves the frame rate in each iteration. for i1100       Starts the timer.     tic       Triggers the webcam1 to capture a frame.     triggerwebcam1       Saves the frame in a dummy variable just to simulate the acquisition time     i1  getdatawebcam1,1       The frame rate for this iteration will 1time for iteration.     ai  1toc     end   Plots the frame rates over time. plota   Cleans up. deletewebcam1 codepre  pIn my computer this code runs somewhat stable around 12.4 fps. Now, the tricky part is this the code runs with the same frame rate if I change the acquisition format to MJPG160x120 or to MJPG12801024p  pDoes this mean that no matter the size of the image MATLAB needs to acquire from the webcam, the fastest frame rate I will be able to achieve in this computer, with this webcam is 12.4fps Or am I missing somethingp  h1One last thing...h1  pIn my software that is, not the simplified code posted above, but my real code, which process each frame the frame rate drops to something about 7 fps when processing the whole frame, but when the computer finds the target and hence, narrows the search using a ROI the frame rate climbs back to about 12 fps not higher, as I would expect. For me this is somewhat good evidence that the max frame rate is not being dictated by my code, but by the image acquisition speed.p  hr  pAny help would be appreciated, thanks in advancep

Negative 27299 pI am not sure whether what I am asking will have any impact or not.

Finally     Client.Disconnected.Unlock     FreeAndNilClient.Disconnected     FreeAndNilClient   End end codepre  pThe disconnect routine to lock the the disconnected variable sets its value to true and performs the operations, in the end it frees up the disconnected variable and also the object leave the other variables.p  pNow there is this other functionp  precodefunction someoperations Var Client TClientInfo begin   Client  FindClientsomename   Client.Disconnected.Lock   Try     If Client.Disconnected.Value  True Then Exit     some operations.....

Now at the same time Thread1 tries to free the object and its variables and Thread2 is accessing the variables of that object.p  pWhat will happen Will it cause an exception or am I just assuming things sorry ive been banging my head with all the exceptions occurring in my server applications.

Negative 27299 pNot being much of a businessperson, Im unsure how I should design the data structure both inmemory and the database schema for invoices in my application which handles accounts receivable from clients.p  pMy question concerns invoice lineitems. Its already a given that items have a name or textual description, a priceperunit, and a quantity value thus the priceperunit multiplied by the quantity gives the line total. However I dont know how I should factorin perline discounts and taxes, especially when both can be expressed as a percentage or as a fixed amount, and then I need to consider the order of operation is a fixedprice discount done before or after a percentage tax increase.p  pHeres the DB schema Im thinkingp  precodeInvoiceItems     InvoiceId        bigint     ProductId        bigint NULL        Optional reference to the product this item is generated from     Description      nvarchar255     PricePerUnit     money     Quantity         decimal9,4     AdjustmentBT     money NULL         beforetax fixedvalue price adjustment      AdjustmentBTPerc decimal9,4 NULL  beforetax percentage price adjustment     Tax              decimal9,4 NULL  tax as a percentage     AdjustmentPT     money NULL         aftertax fixedvalue price adjustment      AdjustmentPTPerc decimal9,4 NULL  aftertax percentage price adjustment  codepre  pSo the linetotal is this functionp  precodeLineTotal       PricePerUnit  Quantity   AdjustmentBT   AdjustmentBTPerc   Tax   AdjustmentBT   AdjustmentPTPerc codepre  pOr in RPNp  precodeLineTotal  PricePerUnit Quantity  AdjustmentBT  AdjustmentBTPerc  Tax  AdjustmentBT  AdjustmentPTPerc  codepre  pAs Im not someone who works with invoices at all, and with limited feedback from the person Im writing this program for, I dont know if Im overthinking it or not. I need to provide sufficient flexibility but without being complicated  and with this approach it means each invoice item is going to look like thisp  precodeDescription  PricePerUnit  Quantity  Beforetax Adjustment  Tax  Posttax Adjustment  computedTotal codepre  p...where the Adjustment fields interpret the entered value as a percentage or fixed value depending on the presence or absence of the  character.p

Negative 27299 pI am limited by a piece of software that utilizes a single core per instance of the program run. It will run off an SQL server work queue and deposit results to the server. So the more instances I have running the faster the overall project is done. I have played with Azure VMs a bit and can speed up the process in two ways.p  p1 I can run the app on a single core VM, clone that VM and run it on as many as I feel necessary to speed up the job sufficiently.p  pORp  p2 I can run the app 8 times on an 8core VM, ...again clone that VM and run it on as many as I feel necessary to speed up the job sufficiently.p  pI have noticed in testing that the speedup is roughly the same for adding 8 single core VMs and 1 8core VM. Assuming this is true, would it better better pricewise to have single core machines p  pThe pricing is a bit of a mystery, whether it is real cpu usage time, or what. It is a bit easier using the 1 8core approach as spinning up machines and taking them down takes time, but I guess that could be automated.p  pIt does seem from some pricing pages that the multiple single core VM approach would cost lessp  pSide question so could I do like some power shell scripts to just keep adding VMs of a certain image and running the app, and then start shutting them down once I get close to finishing After generating the VMs would there be some way to kick off the app without having to remote in to each one and running itp

Negative 27299 pI am creating an import application in VB.NET for an SQL Server 2008 database. I am trying to make the import as generic as possible to reduce maintenance in the future. Therefore it gets all available columns from a preset list of tables in which they can import into.p  pThe main problem is that now I have gotten to the point where I am doing error trapping. I am currently try to check to see whether a value that is being imported is castable as the data type of the field in the database. For example, if you want to import a date into the database but you mistakenly put an address field instead, I want to pick this up and alert the user.p  pSo, I have a VB datatable with the same schema as the database table and a value which I would like to go into the datatable. Below is what I have already which is not alotp  precode    Private Sub SetValueTargetDataTable As DataTable, ColumnName as String, Value as string        Dim DBType as Type  TargetDataTable.ColumnsColumnName.Datatype              End Sub codepre  pI have done some research about reflection but it still requires me to define datatypes. Are there any other ways of doing thisp

I would like to know if this code can be modified to create different coloured balloons.  This will allow me to determine which points come from which source files.p  pSecondary questions 1 Can the balloons be shown as coloured points  The balloons take a lot of visual space when I am working, so I would like to use smaller points if possible. 2 Can the above code be made more compact  The three tags Placemark,Point,coordinates seem like overkill for such a simple presentation.p  pIf anyone is interested they can see more of my consolidated kml files here a hrefhttpssites.google.comsitekeithkmlfileshomekmlfilespointfilessnowden relnofollowhttpssites.google.comsitekeithkmlfileshomekmlfilespointfilessnowdenap  pThanks for any help.p

Negative 27299 pWe have a fairly straightforward native iOS app that is almost ready to be submitted for approval save for one pesky bug. That is that in rare cases when system memory is low and only noticed on iPad 3,1 when resuming the app, it hangs for 10 seconds and then crashes.p  pThe app is basically a UIWebView with a lightweight shell around it for managing some iCloud key values. Were using the native google analytics, the content of our web view is using a cache manifest and local storage.p  pWere only able to reproduce the bug after intentionally hammering the system Safari app by opening many large sites until toggling between tabs causes safari to start refreshing each page as though Safari  iOS has decided that to free up memory its going to flush the contents of the already open tabs. Since our app is mostly just a WebView, were wondering if the system is dumping our content. If that was all that happened, that would be fine  but instead, it hangs and crashes.p  pWe know its an 8badf00d  failed to resume in time  but we just dont know whats causing it.p  pIve posted our crash log below.

Negative 27299 pI realize that runtime of BFS and DFS on a generic graph is Onm, where n is number of nodes and m is number of edges, and this is because for each node its adjacency list must be considered. However, what is the runtime of BFS and DFS when it is executed on a binary tree I believe it should be On because the possible number of edges that can go out of a node is constant i.e., 2. Please confirm if this is the correct understanding. If not, then please explain what is the correct time complexity of BFS and DFS on a binary treep

Negative 27299 pSo I have the ActiveRecord model like thisp  precodeclass User lt ActiveRecordBase   hasmany posts end codepre  pAnd I have Api class that fetches the attributes from web for codeUsercode and returns a hash, which in turn needs some preprocessing to fit into the user model. E.g. the response from api is coderesponse id20, starscount20code needs to be processed to codeuser.id20code and codeuser.starscount20code. p  pNow there are 2 ways that I can easily see to do the fecting thing. One way is add a method to Api like getuser, that does all the processing returns a new codeUsercode model with filled attributes. The other is to add codefetchcode method to User that does all the processing.p  pIn the first case I dont like that my Api class will be filled with a lot of codegetmodelcode methods like codegetusercode, codegetpostcode, codegetallpostsforusercode etc. and quickly can become unmanagable. In the second case the model is filled with a lot of preprocessing stuff methods like codefetchcode, codefetchallpostscode and looks nasty too.p  pSo what is the best practice to deal with this problem p

Negative 27299 pI setup a devise on my rails 4 application. I followed this tutorial a hrefhttpsgithub.complataformatecdevisewikiHowToAllowuserstosigninusingtheirusernameoremailaddress relnofollowhttpsgithub.complataformatecdevisewikiHowToAllowuserstosigninusingtheirusernameoremailaddressa and added the username value. I also wanted First Name and Last Name, so I assumed it was something close to the tutorial. I followed SOME of the parts and skipped the authentication parts, and update the views. It is somewhat working. When registering the fields show up and when you fill up, they pass all check but they DO NOT get entered in the DB. It just shows up NULL for the First name and Last name, but username is actually working.

Negative 27299 pit is my understanding that once a pointer is initialized to a string constant, the string cannot be modified. Ive tried performing the modification and the program crashes.p  pThis theory is given at Chapter 5.5 Character Pointers and Functions in The C Programming Language by Brian W.

What Id like to do is store some data in the abstract parent states scope route 1 and make this available if I were to transition to, for example, route1.step2.p  pCurrently I need to access this scope using scope.parent.parent, which is less than ideal. Is there a neater way to either access the parent non uiview scope or to prevent the uiview tag from creating a scope between the child and parent  Ive tried setting explicit parent properties in the state declaration but it doesnt make any differencep

Lets say there are 3 [lowlevelid] in the first array then the other array would simply look like thisp  precodearray3  [0]gt string3 bla [1]gt string4 blub [2]gt string6 lalala codepre  pand another array that have as many entries as low level identries exist. In every low level identry which contains 5 entries at the moment I want to add a sixth entry  a string from the other array. But I dont know how to access it. Is there away to access it without using hundreds of loopsp  pAnother EDIT I could access the first entry withp  precodeforeachmyarray as key gt subkey     foreachsubkey as val          myarray[key][keysubkey][keyval][6thentry]a new string       codepre  pBut that works only for the first new entry. I dont know how to access the others and how to add a loop for adding entries from the other array.p

Negative 27299 pI have a high intensity model that is written in python, with array calculations involving over 200,000 cells for over 4000 time steps. There are two arrays, one a fine grid array, one a coarser grid mesh, Information from the fine grid array is used to inform the characteristics of the coarse grid mesh. When the program is run, it only uses 1 of the cpu but maxes out the ram 8GB. It takes days to run. What would be the best way to start to solve this problem Would GPU processing be a good idea or do I need to find a way to offload some of the completed calculations to the HDDp  pI am just trying to find avenues of thought to move towards a solution. Is my model just pulling too much data into the ram, resulting in slow calculationsp

Negative 27299 pI have written an mpi app in c that sorts n positive random integers.

Negative 27299 pIn C a Unity script, I have a client that uses either an TcpClient to send and receive data. The client will send a fixed data string every frame to the server. The server just echoes back that same string. This is testing and simulation purposes.p  pI use the Async methods BeginWrite and BeginReceive. The data is sent by the client by usingp  precodestream.BeginWritedata, 0, data.Length, new AsyncCallbackEndTCPSend, null codepre  pAnd I use the following call to receive datap  precodeTCPClient.GetStream.BeginReadTCPBuffer, 0, 1024, new AsyncCallbackOnMessageTCP, null codepre  pNow, the problem is that after a short period of time 1 second or so the client stops sending out data to the server, even though the code that calls the method for sending is still being called verified through log output and Wireshark.

Negative 27299 pI have 2 variables that Im trying to graph and I cant figure out what functions to use in order to get the desired graph that I want. For example, I have a variable Depth which is a 70x12 matrix full of numbers. 12 is for each month of the year. Im trying to graph Depth against Temperature which is also a 70x12 matrix full of numbers. The current way I am doing this is by using plot3 in a for loop with hold on and plotting each Depth vs Temperature curve separated by 1 on the zaxis. That looks like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comLUL6X.jpg altp  pAnd when rotated it looks like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comGdMR6.jpg altp  pHowever, what I want is some sort of meshgrid or surf inbetween my curves so that my graph would look something similar to this. I played around with surf and mesh a decent bit but I cant figure out how to use the data that I have stored in my variables to plot curves and a surface through the curves that looks anything like that. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comzbdio.jpg altenter image description herep

[UnknownId]                 androidlayoutalignBaselineidbuttonMarkUnread                  Explanation for issues of type UnknownId  The id syntax refers to an existing id, or creates a new one if it has not already been defined elsewhere. However, this means that if you have a typo in your reference, or if the referred view no longer exists, you do not get a warning since the id will be created on demand. This check catches errors where you have renamed an id without updating all of the references to it.  Error Suspicious method call should probably call layout rather than onLayout [WrongCall] codepre  pThe weird thing is the error messages seem sort of linty that is they seem more like gotchas than actual compile errors that is, they should be warnings.  Is there a reason that these are compile errors in the newer versions of AS, and is there a simple fix when it comes to correcting codeUnknownIdcode, codeWrongCallcode, codeDuplicateIdscode, and codenotSiblingcode errorsp

Negative 27299 pIm trying to do an ajax button not an actual form button that behaves just like a normal codelinkto content, somepath, remotetruecode would. And when I click it, it swaps out the image to indicate the status e.g. onoff, votednot voted, etc.p  pThe reason is, I want to use javascript to add class, to swap out images, toggling them. Usually, people do this by specifying the backgroundimage property in CSS for a given class, and addremove classes via javascript. p  pBut of course, if you use the rails linkto, that creates an a tag, which is an inline element. This inline element is not friendly for the desired above mentioned behavior. You end up having to use an actual image tag, making the javascript DOM traversal, as well as the CSS messier. You also end up doing silly stuff like p  precodeltdivgt   ltagt     ltdivgt     ltdivgt   ltagt ltdivgt codepre  pjust to keep the link tag as an codeacode tag, while trying to ensure a certain size of the buttonp  pI am looking for an elegant way to accomplish creating a simple ajax button that behaves just like a remote link, where its not a form button, and where I can simply addremove a class to the element in order to swap out images via CSS.p  pIs there a good solution to this Or will I have to use spaghetti jquery and ajax calls on a div element with a specified size Ive tried nesting a codecontenttagcode within a codelinktocode but thats no better than nesting an codeimagetagcode in place of the codecontenttagcode Ive thought about doing codedisplay blockcode to the a tag with codewidth 100code.

Negative 27299 pPlease be kind, Im just learning C and inheriting this application from a formeremployee is my first C project.p  pI am observing inconsistent and slow periods with System.Windows.Forms.Timer.  The application is written in C with MS Visual Studio.p  pThe timer is set for an interval of 100 msec yet I am observing periods ranging from 110 msec to 180 msec.  p  pI am using several tools to observe this including  a SW oscilloscope the Iocomp.Instrumentation.Plotting.Plot package,   a real oscilloscope,   letting the timer run for some time and comparing the number of ticks  100 msec to both the system time and to a stopwatch.  p  pIn all cases I am observing a 10 lag that becomes evident within the first few seconds.p  pThe methods that are executed with each tick take fewer than 4 msec to run.  There is no timeconsuming asynchronous processing happening, either.  This shouldnt matter, though, as the timer tick is an interrupt, not an event added to an event handler queue as far as I know. p  pHas anyone experienced a problem like this before  What were the root causesp  pThanks.p

Im not an objc expert, not sure if this is the right way to do this at all, was using strtol which similarly wasnt working.p  pThe entire function is belowp  precode double parseMV2 NSData data    NSData slicedData  [data subdataWithRangeNSMakeRange2, 4]   const char bytes  [slicedData bytes]   int32t value   double mV  0    int sscanfresult  sscanfbytes, 4x, ampvalue    if 1  sscanfresult      value ltlt 3  discard the 3 most significant bits as they are not part of the value this also brings the sign bit to the most significant bit position.     value gtgt 8  discard the 5 least significant bits as they are below the noise levels.     mV  doublevalue2048.016777216.0  Convert to mV    else      NSLog sscanf failed to read bytes 4x result  d, int32t bytes, sscanfresult       NSLog     mV2  f bytes  x, mV, uint bytes   NSLog    return mV  codepre  pIf I set a breakpoint after the sscanf, sometimes value is set to the correct interpretation of the bytes but very often it is just set to zero.

Negative 27299 pI am working on a static website as a web design project for college. Its a tech blog that contain mock articles. Im storing the website in the root these are pages like index.htm, news.html, reviews.html, etc. However, I want to avoid clutter for actual article pages. So I store these pages in a subdirectory called articles, example articlesarticle1.html.p  pNow I have to write two javascript files because of this. My two javascript files would do exactly the same thing except javascript file A is for all pages in the root and javascript file B is for all pages in the articles subdirectory.

Negative 27299 pHow is a message driven bean MDB accessed by a JVM on another machine within the same network  I see how its strongnotstrong donep  blockquote   p32.4 Accessing Enterprise Beansp      pNote The material in this section applies only to session beans and   not to messagedriven beans. Because they have a different programming   model, messagedriven beans do not have interfaces or nointerface   views that define client access.p      pClients access enterprise beans either through a nointerface view or   through a business interface. A nointerface view of an enterprise   bean exposes the public methods of the enterprise bean implementation   class to clients. Clients using the nointerface view of an enterprise   bean may invoke any public methods in the enterprise bean   implementation class or any superclasses of the implementation class.   A business interface is a standard Java programming language interface   that contains the business methods of the enterprise bean.p blockquote  pa hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavaee7tutorialejbintro004.htmGIPJF relnofollowhttpdocs.oracle.comjavaee7tutorialejbintro004.htmGIPJFap  pThe fine manual goes on to statep  blockquote   p46.6 Receiving Messages Asynchronously Using a MessageDriven Beanp      pIf you are writing an application to run in the Java EE application   client container or on the Java SE platform, and you want to receive   messages asynchronously, you need to define a class that implements   the MessageListener interface, create a JMSConsumer, and call the   method setMessageListener.p      pIf youre writing an application to run in the Java EE web or EJB   container and want it to receive messages asynchronously, you also   need to need to define a class that implements the MessageListener   interface. However, instead of creating a JMSConsumer and calling the   method setMessageListener, you must configure your message listener   class to be a messagedriven bean. The application server will then   take care of the rest.p      pMessagedriven beans can implement any messaging type. Most commonly,   however, they implement the Java Message Service JMS technology.p      pThis section describes a simple messagedriven bean example.

Negative 27299 pIm making a web app using flask and the flasksqlalchemy extension. Users create jobs, which sit in a queue and are processed some number at a time in separate threads. Users poll the server for queue position, progress, etc. p  pIm trying to deploy the app to a test server Ubuntugunicornnginx and Im encountering a bug that doesnt happen with identical code on my development system OSXflask dev server running on localhost. p  pThe bug is that within a new thread, I try to query a table by the primary key of an object that was just created outside the thread. This returns codeNonecode instead of the ORM object I was expecting. If I run mysql on the command line and execute a codeSELECTcode by hand, it confirms that the object does indeed exist in the database.p  pHowever, this only happens after the queue has been exhausted. If I queue up several jobs from the web app, it will process all of them correctly. It will then fail as described above on subsequent jobs added to the now empty queue.p  pOK some abbreviated code that demonstrates the problem.p  pThe queuep  precodefrom app import jobdoer

Negative 27299 pIm trying to integrate the angulartranslate module into my application. p  pIve gotten an asynchronous loader to work correctly, and it loads my language translations correctly.p  pThe problem Im running in to, however, is that our backend is based on Struts 1. We have a template that is included in each page load instead of the body content being swapped out like in a singlepage application. This template is where we instantiate the angular app with codeangular.modulecode and all the dependencies. After instantiation, I set up the translation providerp  precodemyApp.config[translateProvider, functiontranslateProvider     translateProvider.useUrlLoaderurltomyloadaction.do     translateProvider.determinePreferredLanguage ] codepre  pBecause this template is included on each page load, and the angular app is thus instantiated again after each page load, the translation provider is hitting my action on every page load to get the translations.p  pThis wouldnt be a huge load on the backend because Ive implemented caching, but strongemthe problem is the flashes of untranslated content on every page.emstrongp  pstrongMy proposed solutionstrong is as followsp  ul lipHave a controller that will catch the codetranslateLoadingEndcode event fired by angular translate and put the translation table into a cookie with some expiration timep  precodemyApp.controllerTranslationController, functionscope, rootScope     rootScope.ontranslateLoadingEnd,functionevent           Get the translation table and put it in a cookie       codepreli lipIn the config, I will only set codetranslateProvider.useUrlLoaderurltomyloadaction.docode if the cookie does not exist or it has expired. To do this, I will have to get the cookie by injecting the cookies service into the config with something like the following a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions20588114howtousecookiesproviderinangularconfighow to use cookiesProvider in angular configa and grabbing out the translation tablep  precodevar cookies angular.injector[ngCookies].invokefunctioncookies      cookies  cookies  codepreli ul  pstrongMy questionstrong is if there way to get the translation table for a given language so that I can put it into a cookie.

Negative 27299 pI have a loop that creates links with a javascript function call in the onClick events and uses the text returned from a database as one of the parameters.  My issues I am having is that sometimes this text being returned has parenthesis in them which is causing a syntax error in my code.

Negative 27299 pI am working on a game with 8bit graphics. I provide a Pixelbuffer OSXRenderer.pbo  to my gameloop to fill it up. Then  texsubimage it onto a texture OSXRenderer.ScreenTexture.  The texture is rendered to the screen via a quad. p  pI got it working without problems with a RGB PBO size widthheight3.  But now i want the pbo to be indexed color. So i load a palette into another texture  OSXRenderer.PaletteTexture and changed my PBO. size widthheight.p  pHow i figure it should work is  PBO gets filled with noise random uint8 063, Screentexture gets texsubimaged,  and when rendering it onto the screen via quad, my fragmentshader replaces all the  RED channel values with the corresponding colors from my palette and i get 8bit noise on the screen.p  pBut i simply cant get it to work. I only get a black screen. If I set my fragcolor to the incoming  screentexturepbo data i get red noise. Just as expected.p  pstrong[EDIT]strong I tested the fragmentshaders colorvariable values.

Negative 27299 pI am using Octave under Ubuntu. My Octave script has to make calculations with a big matrix, which I set the size. I want this matrix to be as large as possible within my memory requirements, so I do a few trials to use a reach a large enough matrix.p  pHowever, when I exceed the size, of course Ubuntu starts using Swap memory which makes everything really sluggish and at this point I want to cancel the script execution. But when I cancel, Octave tries to store my variables which I dont want to. Below is a CTRLC examplep  precodeC panic Interrupt  stopping myself... C attempting to save variables to octaveworkspace... C CC codepre  pThis thing can take about half an hour to cancel.p  pSo, the straight question is how to avoid Octave to try to save the variables to the disk, and just quit insteadp

The main problem I have is that if one or both of the field requests returns validtion error then I dont want RegisterUserForNewFunction to run as it will redirect to a new page.

I need to model this grouping system in the database so it can be queried later and the groups reappear. What is the best way to design the database with this capabilityp  pemSome more detail from a user perspectiveem When a user selects an item from table one, that ID is sent to the next activity. The next activity queries the join table for the appropriate content. The way its working now, it just shows one item per row from the JoinTable. The user should be able to for example, drag an item onto another item to group them together.p

Problem is that when I am trying access BackgroundMediaPlayer.Current with events my music player dont play any music but when I delete events from main page It start works again. I manage my music player from other page.

Negative 27299 pI have been looking for answers on stack and they do have a few examples on this but for some reason the only way I can get this to display the categories is by using the foreach statement.

If there are 100 smallcents in the inventory list I only need it to show me the category once but I also need one of all the categories that currently have active items in the inventory in order to use in a later script to show a report of total price value of items in each category. p  pAt the moment I have it showing me the full list of categories for every category that has active items in the inventory.

Negative 27299 pI have a piece of Haskell code which capitalises words appropriately. For example, it will take rObOT and change it to Robot. One function is list comprehension, the other is recursive. Both seem to work exactly the same according to all values I have passed through them but despite this quickCheck claims that they are not equivalent and that they are falsifiable after 1 test.p  precode Listcomprehension version capitalise  String gt String capitalise xs  toUpper head xs [toLower x  x lt tail xs]   Recursive version capitalFuncRec  String gt String capitalFuncRec []  [] capitalFuncRec xxs  toLowerx  capitalFuncRec xs  capitaliseRec  String gt String capitaliseRec []  [] capitaliseRec xxs  toUpper x  capitalFuncRec xs   Mutual test  propcapitalise  String gt Bool propcapitalise xs  capitaliseRec xs  capitalise xs codepre
