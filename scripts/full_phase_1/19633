Negative 19633 pIm working on my first .NET project .NET 3.5, ADO.NET and C.  Weve built our entity models and are trying to build a clean business objects layer.p  pWeve got our basic entity model and we want to add certain businesslevel semantics to the default data accessors navigation properties, etc.p  pFor example, lets assume that we have a manytomany relationship between codePersoncode and codeBankAccountscode.  Lets assume that at the business layer we would like to add the ability to freeze an account.  We now want the ability to navigate from a Person top  ul liall their bank accounts,li litheir nonfrozen bank accounts, andli litheir frozen bank accounts.li ul  pNaturally wed like to make the nominal case the default  If I navigate codePerson.BankAccountscode Id like it to return their nonfrozen accounts.  I could add the navigation properties codePerson.FrozenBankAccountscode and codePerson.AllBankAccountscode.p  pBoth approaches weve come up with seem to have a fair amount of code smell.p  ol liWe cant find a way to override the entity models methods.  So, leave codePerson.BankAccountscode as the accessor that returns all bank accounts.  Then we add a codePerson.FrozenBankAccountscode and a codePerson.NonFrozenBankAccountscode.li liAdd another explicit layer to the code base that wraps all accesses to codeBankAccountscode.li ol  pWith approach 1, the problem is that the nominal business case accessing unfrozen bank accounts is the most unintuitive method name of the lot.p  pWith approach 2, when we subclass the objects from the entity model layer we have to override every method to ensure that it wont return objects from the underlying layer.  So we create a codeBLPersoncode which has a codeBankAccountscode method that returns a collection of codeBLBankAccountcode objects.  But in this case, all that code seems a little silly.p  pIs there a better approach than the two weve considered  If there isnt a better approach, which of the two Ive outlined seem like the better solution given that weve got something like 50 classes we need to work withp  pstrongNotestrong While doing a web search, I did find an open letter to Microsoft titled a hrefhttpefvote.wufoo.comformsadonetentityframeworkvoteofnoconfidenceADO .NET Entity Framework Vote of No Confidencea that seems to imply that there isnt a good way to add in a clear separation of concerns.p

Negative 19633 pSo what Im trying to do is replace a string keyword with      codeltbgtkeywordltbgtcode in a larger string.p  pExamplep  pmyString  HI there. You should higher that person for the job. Hi hi.p  pkeyword  hip  presult I would  want would bep  pcoderesult  ltbgtHIltbgt there. You should higher that person for the job. code codeltbgtHiltbgt ltbgthiltbgt.codep  pI will not know what the keyword until the user types the keyword  and wont know the corpus myString until the query is run. p  pI found a solution that works most of the time, but has some false positives,  codenamely it would return ltbgthiltbgtgher codewhich is not what I want. Also note that I  am trying to preserve the case of the original text, and the matching should take  place irrespective of case. so if the keyword is hi it should replace  codeHI with ltbgtHIltbgt and hi with ltbgthiltbgt.codep  pThe closest I have come is using a slightly derived version of this a hrefhttpcode.activestate.comrecipes576715 relnofollowhttpcode.activestate.comrecipes576715a but I still could not figure out how to do a second pass of the string to fix all of the false positives mentioned above. p  pOr using the NLTKs WordPunctTokenizer which simplifies some things like punctuation but Im not sure how I would put the sentences back together given it does not  have a reverse function and I want to keep the original punctuation of myString. Essential, doing a concatenation of all the tokens does not return the original  string. For example I would not want to replace 7  7 with 77 when regrouping the tokens into its original text if the original text had 7  7. p  pHope that was clear enough. Seems like a simple problem, but its a turned out a little more difficult then I thought. p

Negative 19633 pI have to copy a bunch of data from one database table into another. I cant use SELECT ... INTO because one of the columns is an identity column. Also, I have some changes to make to the schema. I was able to use the export data wizard to create an SSIS package, which I then edited in Visual Studio 2005 to make the changes desired and whatnot. Its certainly faster than an INSERT INTO, but it seems silly to me to download the data to a different computer just to upload it back again. Assuming that I am correct that thats what the SSIS package is doing. Is there an equivalent to BULK INSERT that runs directly on the server, allows keeping identity values, and pulls data from a table as far as I can tell, BULK INSERT can only pull data from a filep  pEdit I do know about IDENTITYINSERT, but because there is a fair amount of data involved, INSERT INTO ... SELECT is kinda of slow. SSISBULK INSERT dumps the data into the table without regards to indexes and logging and whatnot, so its faster. Of course creating the clustered index on the table once its populated is not fast, but its still faster than the INSERT INTO...SELECT that I tried in my first attemptp  pEdit 2 The schema changes include but are not limited to the following 1. Splitting one table into two new tables. In the future each will have its own IDENTITY column, but for the migration I think it will be simplest to use the identity from the original table as the identity for the both new tables. Once the migration is over one of the tables will have a onetomany relationship to the other. 2. Moving columns from one table to another. 3. Deleting some cross reference tables that only cross referenced 1to1. Instead the reference will be a foreign key in one of the two tables. 4. Some new columns will be created with default values. 5. Some tables arent changing at all, but I have to copy them over due to the put it all in a new DB request.p

See my a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1829460springlayoutproblemchallengeother questiona. So... if you have a Swing app to design, and you want your layout emjust soem, what are your preferred layout managers Any interestinguseful experiences to relatep  pstrongUpdatestrong Yup, sure Im aware that different LMs are appropriate for different layouts. But Id expect that most of you use 1, 2 or maybe 3 for most everything you do, or you swear by a single one thats so versatile you never need anything else. With enough responses, Id expect to see something like a bell curve, with a peak on GridBagLayout or MigLayout for example and a long tail of a few stragglers using say BoxLayout or FlowLayout.p  pHopefully, the distribution of responses will reveal some trends as to what people use most to emGet Stuff Doneemtradep  phrp  h2UPDATE and Summaryh2  pOK, after almost 2 days, MiGLayout is definitely out in front Its fans will be happy to hear that it looks like this layout will be entering the official library soon.p  pGroupLayout, FormsLayout and TableLayout are relatively new and havent gotten much exposure. Perhaps others will be as surprised to find out about them as I was.p

Im asking a simple way because I dont want to pass each POST data through AJAX or validate data because this is all handled by the PHP page 2.php by redirecting to pages.p  pI was able to do it the problem is that once you submit, since it returns true, everything on the original page stops. For example I put an animation to text Processing, please wait... with a gif which respectively wont continue through the all waiting time and wont show because if not saved in the cache some other time previously the submit will stop that process to download it, even if I preload it it wont animate for the same reason.p  pBasically what I need is to pass all the POST data through jquery ajax on submit returning false to allow the new next to show and let the process continue on whatever response.p  pThank you.p

Pros fast, Cons each full path string takes up uneccessary and redundant amount of memoryp  pb Store just the actual directory name in a dictionary with a list of all directories with that name, then check the matches if its correct Pros pretty fast, Cons has to either store a list for each directory or use boxing to store either a list or directory in the dictionary.p  pc Skip the dictionary, traverse the tree from the root and find a match by splitting the path. Perhaps use PLINQ to speed things up. Pros No memory overhead with the dictionary, cons potentially slower than lookup.p  pd some other way i havent thought of...p

Negative 19633 pI have been recently reproducing the new twitter uisliding panes and I have built quite a similarif not slightly better functionality for it. I dont have some problems with it recently until a couple of bugs surfaced when I tried to refactor. That said, I am at a crossroads as to deciding if I should refactor my code and use OOP. p  pFor a little background as to what I did, I have a list of items which have the expandable class. Inside them, i have a div called .inner in which I put the data for the right side there. I then have a .expandable click function that animates the right pane and clones all the contents of the .inner div and puts it in the right pane.p  pWhen the page loads, the I create a number of right side panes with the class .pane which is hidden under the left side pane. I could go on with my implementation as needed but what I was thinking was to convert each of these huge click functions etc and just create say a Pane object which has all the methods for animating, hiding, itself etc.p  pProblem with this is I am not sure if it is a good idea, especially if there are a lot of panes. Will turning my panes into objects increase or decrease load timefunctionality Is a click event tied to a class .expandable.click  faster than if expandable was a method of a Pane object What about if there were 30 Panesexpandable thingsp

Negative 19633 pIm trying to debug a webapp using Apache Camel from Eclipse and while Im tracing into I arrive at a point where Eclipse says that no source file is available and I can see bytecode shown in Eclipse where usually I see sourcecode but apparently I cannot advance into that bytecode I try F6  Step Over but nothing happens anyway not that it would have been that useful compared to source code.p  pSo how are you supposed to trace into such a beastp  pIm wondering if all these codegeneratingcodeintercepting layers arent creating more problems than theyre trying to solve.

Negative 19633 pGiven the code later in the question, I am getting the following error from the EF4 codefirst APIp  blockquote   pThe given property Roles is not a   supported navigation property.  The   property element type IRole is   not a supported entity type.

Then use Data Annotations to make sure the actual ListltIRolegt is ignored by EF4.li liCreate duplicate classes for all entities which EF4 codefirst will use and then Map those to the official ones that implement the interface.li ol

Negative 19633 pI have a gtk treeview that Im using like a list view and I want to give it a callback that activates when the user clicks single click, not double click a single entry in it. I know the activated callback for the treeview widget activates for double clicks, and if I have only been able to set up the gtk.gdk.event for single click on the entire treeview widget witch is not the behavior that Im looking for. Further more the cellrenderer objects inside it dont inherit the widget class which makes it so I cant give the callback to that one in particular.

Negative 19633 pI have a project with multiple targets each of which builds a pretty similar versions of the app but with different images assets and plists.

Negative 19633 pI have been doing dynamic PDF creation via ASP.net for some time  in the form of HTML to PDF conversion.  It works well for us, but we have accessibility requirements from the State to make everything is accessible.  For static PDFs, we simply tag the files manually using Adobes accessibility tools.  Of course this does not work for dynamically created files.  PDFs that I create dynamically fail the Acrobat Pro Accessibility test.p  pDoes anyone have any ideas about create PDFs dynamically in ASP.net, but producing PDFs that are tagged and can pass the Adobe Accessiblity test  I have researched many components, but none that I have found support tagging.p  pThanks.p

Negative 19633 pI have a small APP which allows users to view information on Beers and Beers they have tried for a local Bars Beer Club.p  pI have 4 Views. Beer Menu, All Stats, My Stats and Settings.p  pOriginally, I thought to pull all of the data via a web service and return xml at initial load of the app, and use it throughout.p  pOR...p  pI could just pull what I need when I need it. This would result in just pulling the data I need, which would be faster, but it would result in more requests.

Negative 19633 pI have a small project that Ive been working on in C, and due to the nature of what it does, I need to insert packets in to a live TCP stream. The purpose is innocent enough, a hrefhttpee.forumify.comviewtopic.phpid3299 relnofollowhttpee.forumify.comviewtopic.phpid3299a if you MUST know Im creating a level editor for a game, and due to the nature of the handshakes, I cant simply establish a new connection with a high level library such as WinSock. Until now, it has relied on Winsock Packet Editor to do the dirty work, but if I were to let the application handle it all, it would make everyone happy.p  pSo my question is this Is there an API somewhere that will allow me to take control of a live TCP stream, and preferably one that keeps it valid after it finishes And I would prefer to not have to inject any DLLs. Also, Detours is a nono as Im using GCCMingw.p  pIve toyed around with WinPCap and I have some working code I can collect a packet, and from that generate a proper packet to send but since it operates at such a low level, I cannot anticipate all of the potential protocols that the end user might use. Yes, chances are that theyll be using IPv4 over Ethernet, but what about those people who still use PPP, or some other obscure protocol Also, the connection  gets dropped by the client application after mine is done with it, as the latest ID values in the packets have changed and the client assumes that it has disconnected.p  pSo, if anyone could provide a highlevel TCP stream manipulator, I would be very happy. If not, Ill just continue tinkering with WinPCap and tell all the dialup users to go get better internet.p  pTarget platform Microsoft Windows XP through Windows 7p
Negative 19633 pHey, I dont exactly know where to go with this question. Ive search numerous hours, but I havent been able to find the appropriate solution. What I want to do Get the html of a certain webpage Lets say in this case a hrefhttpwww.google.com relnofollowhttpwww.google.coma. I want to show this html within my wpf application, so that you can see the content of the page you requested. Then I want to be able to trigger events on the html that has been loaded from the URL. Like I want you to be able to click on a certain node in the HTML and I want to be able to link this node to a certain value. Basically a crawler application that lets you request a page, see the page in a control and allows you to click in the loaded HTML and link values to predefined values you set. So basically I want to be able to get a webpage displayed within my application and be able to trigger events on the html For example a click on the html which would need me to know on what node you clicked in the html, or for example be able to edit the html by clicking in it. Anyone got any idea Any help would be highly appreciated An example of software like this a hrefhttpwww.visualwebripper.com relnofollowhttpwww.visualwebripper.comap  pAny help to point me in the good direction would be higly appreciated I have searched and searched, but havent been able to come to a solution as Im new to WPF.p

Negative 19633 pHey, So I am new to Android and tried to implement a class that has a lot of lines of code by making a wrapper class that makes it a new thread. Within this activity it calls a bunch of other classes and while my UI thread loads fine, I think my calculation thread is timing out or having some other form of failure because when I run it I get the ANR dialogue. To see how far in it is failing I put in a println in one of my inner classes and it seems to be failing very early on. Is there a time limit on AsyncTasks or am I maybe doing something wrong that is causing it to crash any advice is much appreciated. p
Negative 19633 pmy application opens n forms and the user can freely switch back and forth among these forms. When the user decides to confirm the operations performed on one of the forms, I would like to block the other ones until this process which can potentially open MessageBoxes andor other forms comes to an end.  It is not enough to disable the forms, since the user cant do anything on them, but the Activated event is fired, and this is exactly what I want to avoid. I tried to set ControlStyles.Selectable to false to all these forms, but it doesnt work.p  pJust in order to make it clearer, the forms cover the whole screen, so the users activate them clicking on the taskbar. This is the situation where opening a modal form and having the confirm code executed there does not prevent the Activated event to be fired.p

Negative 19633 pHow should I store a users height and weight in a MySQL database such that I can use the information to find users within a certain height or weight Also, I will need to be able to display this information in either English or metric system.p  pMy idea is to store the information for height in centimeters and weight in kilograms I prefer metric over English. I can even let the user enter their information and English system, but do the conversion to metric before saving. I think converting kilograms to pounds might be easy to do in SQL, but Im not sure how easy it would be to convert code178code centimeters to code510code rounded slightly down.p  pShould I be saving English and metric values in the database so that I dont need to do conversions when I do my queries Sounds like a bad idea to store derivedcomputed values.p

So what if I just assigned the function contents to a variable and coerced them to characterp  precodefxnnames lt apropos. fxns lt lapplyfxnnames,get as.characterfxns[[1]]  Error in as.characterfxns[[1]]     cannot coerce type builtin to vector of type character codepre  pIs there a trick here  Perhaps an .Internal function that I dont know aboutp
Negative 19633 pI need a controller in my Zend Framework project, which should handle only ajax requests.p  pMy approach at the moment is to extend the ZendControllerActionp  precodeclass HtAjaxController extends ZendControllerAction     public function preDispatch         thisgtgetResponsegtsetHeaderContenttype, textplain                             gtsetHeaderCacheControl,nocache         thisgthelpergtviewRenderergtsetNoRendertrue         thisgthelpergtlayoutgtdisableLayout           public function outputJsondata         thisgtgetResponsegtsetBodyjsonencodedata                             gtsendResponse         exit       codepre  pAlthough, I know this isnt the recommended way to do so in Zend Framework. So thats why I am asking, how to make this in Zends way p  pThe first thing I thought about  was to make a controller plugin, but how can I register this plugin easily The bootstrap is no option because I need this only for specific controllers. And to register it inside the controller in a very early state seems not very clean.p  pSo how should I implement my Ajax Controller I also know there is the extended Context switching helper ,however I think that way has too much overhead for just setting the content type etc.p

Negative 19633 pI have a stored procedure on a hosted SQL 2008 instance. In these stored procedures is logic checking for error. I then return an error code using codeRAISERROR, , code if there is a problem. This works well enough, but there is a problem with catching such an error.p  pIn Visual Studio 2010 I can catch the error with the correct codeClasscode and codeStatecode, but never the correct codeNumbercode. I will get a codeMessagecode like the following in the exceptionp  pcodeError , severity , state , was raised, but no message with that error number was found in sys.message. If error is larger than 50000, make sure the userdefined message is added using spaddmessage.codep  pSo clearly the error is being raised correctly from the procedure, but the codeNumbercode returned is always 18054. What am I doing wrong I dont care what the text of the message is, and I dont have permission to run codespaddmessagecode anyway. However, I would like codeNumbercode to be correct so I can properly catch the error in my application and handle it properly.p  pIn case it matters, Im calling the procedure using EF4.p

Negative 19633 pI need some advice on writing a program that will be used as part of a psychology experiment.  The program will track small changes in reaction time.  The experimental subject will be asked to solve a series of very simple math problems such as 2x4 or 35.  The answer is always a single digit.  The program will determine the time between the presentation of the problem and the keystroke that answers it.  Typical reaction times are on the order of 200300 milliseconds.p  pIm not a professional programmer, but about twenty years ago, I took some courses in PLI, Pascal, BASIC, and APL.  Before I invest the time in writing the program, Id like to know whether I can get away with using a programming package that runs under Windows 7 this would be the easiest approach for me, or whether I should be looking at a realtime operating system.  Ive encountered conflicting opinions on this matter, and I was hoping to get some expert consensus.p  pIm not relishing the thought of installing some sort of opensource Linux distribution that has realtime capabilities  but if thats what it takes to get reliable data, then so be it.p

Its much too long.p  pThe second solution I found is to use MERGE.

So with 8M it would probably take few minutes. The bottleneck is When not matched  when I commented this line, this procedure runs on average 0,01 second.p  pSo the question is how to improve perfomance of the delete statement p  pDelete is needed to make sure, that table doesnt contains transaction that as been removed in application. But it real scenario it happens really rarely, ane the true need of deleting records is less than 1 on 10000 transaction updates. p  pMy theoretical workaround is to create additional column like transactionDeleted bit and use UPDATE instead of DELETE, ane then make table cleanup by batch job every X minutes or hours and Execute p  precodedelete from transactions where transactionDeleted1 codepre  pIt should be faster, but I would need to update all SELECT statements in other parts of application, to use only transactionDeleted0 records and so it also may afect application performance. p  pDo you know any better solutionp  pUPDATE Current indexesp  precodeCREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX [IX1] ON [dbo].[Transactions]   [platform] ASC, [ItemId] ASC  WITH PADINDEX   OFF, STATISTICSNORECOMPUTE   OFF, SORTINTEMPDB  OFF,   IGNOREDUPKEY  OFF, DROPEXISTING  OFF, ONLINE  OFF, ALLOWROWLOCKS   ON, ALLOWPAGELOCKS   ON, FILLFACTOR  50 ON [PRIMARY]   CONSTRAINT [IX2] UNIQUE NONCLUSTERED   [ItemId] DESC, [count] ASC, [dt] DESC, [platform] ASC, [price] ASC  WITH PADINDEX   OFF, STATISTICSNORECOMPUTE   OFF, IGNOREDUPKEY  OFF, ALLOWROWLOCKS   ON, ALLOWPAGELOCKS   ON ON [PRIMARY] codepre

Negative 19633 pin my project, some entities should have a signature property based on their values. For example, after creating an entity and filling its attributes, when codeentity.saveorupdatecode method is called, hibernate event listener should take the control and gather the next sequence value for uniqueid from db. then the same event should produce a signaturelets say a String based on entity attributes and this uniqueid. after sign, the real saveorupdate event should be called. So entity with sign attribute filled is written to database.p  pthe problem is, in saveorupdate event, i do some work and call saveorupdate, so endless operation occurs.p  pdo you have any solution about this kind of problem rather than using aspect oriented programmingp

Negative 19633 pThis is just an exercise in mechanics. I am attempting to create three custom panels that control their own progress bar. Its part of a time management program I am writing for myself to learn more about Java. The larger program uses dates input by the user to create the framework for the minmax of the progress bar. Both this program and the larger one exhibit the same behavior with multiple bars racing the clock.p  pThe issue I am having is that if I have just one bar everything seems to work just fine, but when I have more than one everything seems to go bust. So I wrote this little program to test some things out. Its very simple, takes three custom panels, gives them a label and uses a timer event to change the label and the position of the progress bar. My question is If the math lines up System output shows the calculation and Im counting events every second 1000 milliseconds why is everything beating the count down.p  pPlease forgive my lack of form with my code.

Negative 19633 pI am buliding a GUI around an algorithm. For this purpose I have a Window component which contains a Image component inside it. p  pThe content inside the Image component imgHolder is given by a BitmapImage object image, which for the purpose of this example is initialized as suchp  precodeimage  new BitmapImage image.BeginInit image.CacheOption  BitmapCacheOption.OnLoad image.CreateOptions  BitmapCreateOptions.IgnoreImageCache image.UriSource  new Urica1.bmp image.EndInit  imgHolder.Source  image codepre  pThe main program containing the Window will perform a call to one of the algorithms functions from within the Matlab DLL file. This will run one iteration of the algorithm, by the end of which it will write the results to the local bmp file from above ca1.bmp.  Consequently the underlying data for the image has been updated and I would like for this to be reflected in the imgHolder component. For this purpose I am simply duplicating the code above whenever I return from the function. p  pThe problem with this approach is that the algorithm will have around 100 iterations per run so this would have to happen 100 times. It just doesnt seem right. I would be creating 100 different bitmap images all sourced from the same file. p  pResearching this I found out that one could use memorystream instead but I wonder whether this would be a drastical improvement or not as it seems that I would still have to create 100 images as the algorithm executes. Is it not possible to directly modify the underlying buffer somehow I hear that GetPixel and SetPixel are not very efficient as they set a lock each time they are called. Is it possible perhaps to do this using the same image object If this was not a local file, I couldve used a no cache option and it shouldve worked by itself. Having a no cache option with the file being local did not work because of the lock.p  pDoes anyone have a better ideap  pThanksp

Negative 19633 pWhen you have a TDBGrid,  full row selection, and always show selection, even when not focused, and you want to fully ownerdraw it, you have a choice of a deprecated event codeOnDrawDataCellcode , and a new event codeDrawColumnCellcode, I chose the latter and try thisp  precodeprocedure TDbGridTestForm.mygridDrawColumnCellSender TObject   const Rect TRect DataCol Integer Column TColumn State TGridDrawState begin   if  gdSelected in State then begin             mygrid.DrawCellHighlightRect, State, Col, Row   mygrid.Canvas.Brush.Color  clHighlight   mygrid.Canvas.Font.Color  clHighlightText   mygrid.Canvas.FillRectRect   end     mygrid.DefaultDrawColumnCellRect, DataCol, Column, State  end codepre  pAnd what is driving me crazy is that focus indication the highlight color and focus rectangle are not drawn by the DefaultDrawColumnCell code, and Im sure I should be invoking DrawCellHighlight instead of doing the FillRect hack Im doing above. p  pIf I turn on DefaultDrawing, I get one set of glitches odd font painting issues and if I turn it off, I get another set of glitches no highlight even when gdSelected.p  pThe code in DBGrids.pas codeDefaultDrawColumnCellcode does nothing other than paint the text. So clearly, youre supposed to do more, if you take over all the drawing code yourself.  However, the highlight drawing code built into Grids.pas, upon which DBGrids.pas depends, is not designed to be invoked from this context. I cant figure out if I should be invoking codeDrawCellHighlightcode directly shown commented out above, and figuring out Col and Row values, or if I should be writing my own complex version of TCustomGrid.DrawCellHighlight that handles all the various cases manually.p  pSurely this is so simple, and obvious, and Im just overlooking it. NOte that I must leave DefaultDrawing off, and so I must completely paint from within my owner draw event, and that I must be able to run when theme services are not available, and I must use theme services when they are available. So I need to invoke TCustomGrid.DrawCellHighlight directly and I dont know how to, or I need to reimplement it entirely.p

Negative 19633 pI am trying to create a database for an android app including, in part, nonEnglish words which require underlines and accents for proper spelling.  I set my encoding for this package to utf8, which allowed the accented characters to store and display properly.  However, I cannot seem to get a single character underlined.  It displays an empty box for an unrecognized character.p  pAn example of my database helper to create the sqlite is as followsp  precodecv.putENGLISH, to be alive cv.putNATIVE, okcha or okchaha cv.putPARTOFSPEECH, verb cv.putAUDIO, alive cv.putVIDEO, none cv.putIMAGEDEFAULT, none cv.putIMAGEOPTIONAL, none cv.putIMAGETOUSE, none db.insertwords, ENGLISH, cv codepre  pThat      a  is the best I can come up with so far, but the a should actually be an underlined character.p  pI tried html tags like u and u      ltugtaltugt  since that works with string arrays, but it displays as      ltugtaltugt  the html is never interpreted.p  pI tried using      u0332  as explained at a hrefhttpwww.fileformat.infoinfounicodechar332index.htm relnofollowhttpwww.fileformat.infoinfounicodechar332index.htma , but that, too, is never interpreted, so it displays as      au0332 p  pI also tried      amp  818   and      amp  x332   in a similar manner, with similar lack of results.p  pAny ideasp

I will keep thinking about it. I think it has something to do with the canvas no longer being accessible even though the variable resolves correctly and no error is thrown in JS Debugger under FF.p  pI am writing a js framework for rendering to canvas to provide an easy API to write GUI with less code and prettier code than using Canvas API. Its just a wrapper around canvas. But I am not a js expert even though I love js, now anyway.p  pThe following code in the closure can execute and access the scope of the img variable, can raise an alert form that scope on image load, can change the img css style properties, but will not execute a drawImage on the canvas context in context variable. p  pBefore the closure context.fillRect will work fine, but inside the closure it does not.

Negative 19633 pI am working for a K12 school and I am developing a gradebook system. The existing gradebook system that we use which I also developed is based on Excel with VBA. Its always a nightmare for me to consolidate 400 Excel workbooks every end of term. During the summer break, Im planning to put all data in a database for easy management and stuff.p  pMy problem is thisp  pFor a computationintensive application like a gradebook, is it good to store the computations in a table field or is it better to ONLY store the raw data and do the computations only on the frontendp  pThe way the Excel gradebook system works is like this...p  ul liTeacher records each score for each assessment of each student in the form of score  highest possible score. e.g. emQuiz 1  510, Homework 1  2025, etc.emli liThe scores will be calculated as percentages and summarized per component. Component means Quiz, Homework, etc. So there will be something like emQuizzes Average  90, Homework Average  80, etc.emli liDifferent subjects will have different final grade breakdown like emScience  50 Quizzes  50 Homeworks, Math  60 Quizzes  40 Homeworksem. li liThen, the general average grade of each student is computed by getting the average of all subjects.li ul  pEverything above is very easy to make in a spreadsheet but I dont know how to implement it in a database.p  pAs of the moment, Im thinking something like having a table where all assessments are recorded like thisp  precodetblscores     id     studentid     termid     subjectid     componentid     assessmentid     rawscore     highestpossiblescore    not sure about this cause this can be implied from assessmentid codepre  pWould it be useful to store the computations percentage for each score entry, component average, subject average, general average, etc. in the database and use stored procedures and triggers to update them when a new score comes inp  pOr, is it better to just store the raw scores and calculate everything ONLY on the frontend Will this option be faster than the first one knowing that the SELECT queries here will really be more complex due to subqueriesp  pBy the way, Im planning to use PostgreSQL for this.p  pThanks in advance for any advice.p  pDashMugp
Negative 19633 pIm programmerbeginner, but I want to understand the things a bit more deeply. I did some research and read quite a lot of text, but Im still yet to understand some things..p  pWhen coding a basic thing in Cp  precodeint myNumber myNumber  3 printfHeres my number d, myNumber codepre  pI found out that mainly on 32bit CPU integer takes place of 32 bits  4 bytes. So at first line of my code CPU goes into the memory. The memory is byteaddressable, so CPU chooses 4 continuous bytes for my variable and stores the address to first or last byte.p  pOn the second line of my code CPU uses his stored address of the MyNumber variable, goes to that address in the memory and finds there 32 bits of reserved space. His task now is to store there the number 3, so he fills those four bytes with the sequence 00000000000000000000000000000011. On the third line it does the same  CPU goes to that address in memory and loads the number stored in that address.p  pemFirst question  Do I understand it rightemp  pWhat I dont understand is thisbr The size of that address pointer to that variable is 4bytes in 32bit CPU. emThats why 32bit CPU can use max 4GB of memory  because there are only 232 different addresses of binary length 32embr Now, strongwhere the CPU stores these addressesstrong Does he have some sort of its own memory or cache to store that And strongwhy it stores the 32 bit long address to 32 bit long integerstrong Wouldnt it be better to simply store in its cache that actual number than the pointer to that when the sizes are the samep  pAnd last one  if it stores somewhere in its own cache the addresses to all those integers and the lenghts are the same 4 bytes, it will need exactly the same space for storing the addresses as for the actual variables. But variables can take up to 4GBs of space so CPU must have 4GB of its own space to store the addresses to those variables. And that sounds strange..p  pThank you for helpbr Im trying to understand that but its so tough.. [p

In the solution below we use two semaphores, fillCount and emptyCount, to solve the problem. fillCount is the number of items to be read in the buffer, and emptyCount is the number of available spaces in the buffer where items could be written. fillCount is incremented and emptyCount decremented when a new item has been put into the buffer. If the producer tries to decrement emptyCount while its value is zero, the producer is put to sleep. The next time an item is consumed, emptyCount is incremented and the producer wakes up. The consumer works analogously.p

For tests  when I delete something 200px before this stopboundary, it stops scrolling 200px further if we are looking on the text so this stopboundary doesnt depend on data.p  pstrongEditstrong I split my content for two scrollable areas. Now I cant scroll both to the end. I can scroll maybe 90 of them. When I had one scrollable area I could scroll it maybe to 90, it was hard to calculate, but now I can see that.p  pThe thing is happening only on IE8, on ff 11, Chrome and IE9 all the page is scrollable.

Negative 19633 pIm reading Raymond Smullyans To mock a Mockingbird. In the book there is a puzzle that goes like thisp  blockquote   pAny resemblance between the Seville of this story and the    famous Seville of Spain which in fact there isnt is purely    coincidental. In this mythical town of Seville, the male inhabitants wear wigs on those and only those days when they feel like it. No two inhabitants behave alike on all days that is, given any two male inhabitants, there is at least one day on which one of them wears a wig and the other doesnt.    Given any male inhabitants X and Y, inhabitant Y is said    to be a follower of X ifY wears a wig on all days that X does.    Also, given any inhabitants X, Y, and Z, inhabitant Z is said    to be a follower of X and Y if Z wears a wig on all days that    X and Y both do. p      pFive of the inhabitants are named Alfredo, Bernardo, Ben    ito, Roberto, and Ramano. The following facts are known    about them p      pFact 1.. Bernardo and Benito are opposite in their wigwear    ing habits that is, on any given day, one of them wears a wig    and the other one doesnt. p      pFact 2 Roberto and Ramano are likewise opposites. p      pFact 3 Ramano wears a wig on those and only those days    when Alfredo and Benito both wear one. p      pSeville has exactly one barber, and the following facts are    known about him p      pFact 4 Bernardo is a follower of Alfredo and the barber. p      pFact 5 Given any male inhabitant X, if Bernardo is a fol    lower of Alfredo and X, then the barber is a follower of X    alone. p      pAlfredo wears only black wigs Bernardo wears only white    wigs Benito wears only gray wigs Roberto wears only red    wigs and Ramano wears only brown wigs. p      pOne Easter morning, the barber was seen wearing a wig.    What color was he wearing p blockquote  pI figured out it would be fun to solve this in Prolog, but I got stuck rather earlyp  precodeisOpposite bernardo, benito   . isOpposite benito  , bernardo . isOpposite roberto , ramano   . isOpposite ramano  , roberto  .  wears alfredo , black . wears bernardo, white . wears benito  , gray  . wears roberto , red   . wears ramano  , brown .  whatWearsTheBarber WigColor     member Barber, [ alfredo, benito, bernardo, roberto, ramano ] ,   wears Barber, WigColor . codepre  pI dont know how to effectively encode that someone follows some other people and I dont know how to reason based on that information. Ive followed solutions of some other logical puzzles in Prolog, but I couldnt figure out solutions for this one.p  pstrongEDITstrong Heres the solution copied from Smulyans bookp  blockquote   pStep 1 First, we prove that Roberto is a follower of the    barber. p      pWell, consider any day on which the barber wears a wig.    Either Alfredo wears a wig on that day or he doesnt. Suppose    Alfredo does. Then Bernardo also wears a wig on that day,    because Bernardo is a follower of Alfredo and the barber. So    Benito cant wear a wig on that day, because he is opposite    to Bernardo. Then Ramano cant wear a wig on that day,    because he wears wigs only on those days when Alfredo and    Benito both do, and Benito doesnt have one on this day. Since    Ramano doesnt wear a wig on this day, then Roberto must,    because Roberto is opposite to Ramano. This proves that on    any day on which the barber wears a wig, if Alfredo also does,    then so does Roberto. p      pNow, what about a day on which the barber wears a wig    but Alfredo doesnt Well, since Alfredo doesnt, then it cer    tainly is not the case that Alfredo and Benito both do hence    Ramano doesnt, by Fact 3, and therefore Roberto does, by    Fact 2. So Roberto wears a wig on any day that the barber    does and Alfredo doesntindeed, he wears a wig on all days    that Alfredo doesnt, regardless of the barber.    This proves that on any day on which the barber wears a    wig, Roberto also does, regardless of whether Alfredo does    or does not wear a wig on that day. So Roberto is indeed a    follower of the barber. p blockquote

Negative 19633 pI am writing a MonoTouch iOS application.p  pI have a group of 4 UIButtons on my main View. They are more or less in a horizontal row. I want to rotate them by an angle between 90 and 90 degrees as a group with the right most button being the anchor for the group of buttons.p  pI cant figure out how to do this.p  pOne thing I tried was I put these buttons inside of a UIView and then set the Transform to a CGAffineTransform.MakeRotation, but it rotates around the center of the UIView. I also tried making this parent UIView be wider than it needed to be so that the right most button in the group was in the center of the UIView. This worked for the rotation, but then the large blank section that was the right half of the parent UIView covers up other buttons that are on my main View that I need to be visible.p  pSo my question is how do rotate UIButtons of a UIView where the rotation is around a point that is NOT the center of the UIButton or UIViewp
Negative 19633 pI have an UIView with embedded an UITableView. One text field in the same view should control the tables cells number. If the user enters the number 4, immediately the TableView should change its cells number to reflect what the user entered. The content of the cells will just be something like Please select.p  pThen, when the user selects a cell, a Date Picker should come up, let the user choose the datetime and then, when the picker is dismissed, that cell should change to the datetime selected.p  pIm going crazy with this since more than two days. I dont put any code here because I really have no idea where to start and all the things Ive tried so far were a complete failure.p  pIf anyone can lead me to the solution, I would really appreciate it. Thanks.p

An interesting condition is that the language may be infinite, so the solution has to be lazy in that case, the test cases for the solution codetake 2000 ...code.p  pI have a solution that works on my machine, but when I submit it on the website, it blows the stack if I increase the amount of acceptable strings to be determined from 2000 to 20000, I also blow the stack locally, so its a deficiency of my solution. p  pMy solution[1] isp  pre classlanglisp prettyprintoverridecodefn [dfa]   let [startstate dfa start         acceptstates dfa accepts         transitions dfa transitions]     letfn [       acceptstate [state] contains acceptstates state        followtransitionsfrom [state prefix]           lazyseq mapcat              fn [pair] enumeratelanguage val pair str prefix key pair             transitions state        enumeratelanguage [state prefix]         if acceptstate state            cons prefix followtransitionsfrom state prefix           followtransitionsfrom state prefix       ]          enumeratelanguage startstate      codepre  pit accepts the DFA p  precodestates q0 q1 q2 q3               alphabet a b c               start q0               accepts q1 q2 q3               transitions q0 a q1                             q1 b q2                             q2 c q3 codepre  pand returns the language that DFA accepts codea ab abccode.

Obviously I should restructure the solution to be tail recursive, but I dont see how that is possible. In particular, I dont see how it is even possible to combine laziness with tailrecursiveness via either coderecurcode or codetrampolinecode. The codelazyseqcode function creates a closure, so using coderecurcode inside codelazyseqcode would use the closure as the recursion point. When using codelazyseqcode inside coderecurcode, the codelazyseqcode is always evaluated, because coderecurcode issues a function call that needs to evaluate its arguments.p  pWhen using codetrampolinecode,I dont see how I can iteratively construct a list whose elements can be lazily evaluated. As I have used it and see it used, codetrampolinecode can only return a value when it finally finishes i.e. one of the trampolining functions does not return a function.p  h2Other solutions are considered out of scopeh2  pI consider a different kind of solution to this 4Clojure problem out of scope of this question. Im currently working on a solution using codeiteratecode, where each step only calculates the strings the next step following transitions from the current statew accepts, so it doesnt recurse at all. You then only keep track of current states and the strings that got you into that state which are the prefixes for the next states. Whats proving difficult in that case is detecting when a DFA that accepts a emfiniteem language will no longer return any results. I havent yet devised a proper stopcriterion for the codetakewhilecode surrounding the codeiteratecode, but Im pretty sure Ill manage to get this solution to work. For this question, Im interested in the fundamental question can laziness and tailrecursiveness be combined or is that fundamentally impossiblep  p[1] Note that there are some restrictions on the site, like not being able to use codedefcode and codedefncode, which may explain some peculiarities of my code. p
Negative 19633 pI am very new to web coding about a week or so but am making great strides.  Ive run into a problem that Im not sure will be a big issue or not.p  pIm building a website to showcase my photography www.MattTilghman.com  VERY much a work in progress.  Uploading the files manually and editing all the html files accordingly will be very annoying and time consuming, so Ive decided to write a PHP script which will help me streamline the process.p  pThis PHP file has not made it online yet, Im doing all my testing locally first.  Right now it does exactly what Im asking it to though its not finished, so you might see some hanging chads in the code.p  pBasically right now, when I select the file names, it moves them from their original folder, to the one I specify, which is located somewhere in the wampwwwhtdocs etc.  It then edits the html files to add code which points to this image, and low and behold, the new html files do exactly as I want, and show the images fine.p  pHOWEVER, if I navigate to the copies of the images within the wamp server directory, they cannot be opened by any program.  I guess the html is displaying them fine, but every other program gives me an access denied error.  How do I avoid this  Is there some sort of access permission I need to set in the PHP file  Will any of this be a problem once I move the file onlinep  pAs I said, Ive only been doing this about a week, so be gentle.

Negative 19633 pIm connecting an embedded device to a remote server via TCPIP using HTTP.  I have two layers of routers, and am having issues connecting to the remote server if both layers are in place.  My upper most router is 10.0.0.X, and my lower local router is 192.168.1.X.p  pIf I bypass the 192.168.1.X router, and put my device and laptop on a hub connected to the 10.0.0.X router, my device completes the handshaking sequence to the server correctly.  I see my SYN go out, the server responds with a SYNACK, to which I respond with an ACK.  HTTP takes over from there.p  pIf I plug my device and laptop into the 192.168.1.X router, and plug this router into the 10.0.0.X router, then I still see my SYN request go out, but I get no response from the server.p  pIt seems to me that my 192.168.1.X router is blocking either my request from leaving, or the response from getting back in.  I checked the 192 router settings, and the firewall is off wide open.p  pI have Wireshark available on my laptop, and have considered sniffing the other side of the 192 router, but I dont know if I can the traffic, since I would expect the 10.0.0.X router wont pass them back down to other ports, even if theyre there.p  pMy questionsp  ul lipAny ideas how I can debug this to see where the breakdown is occurring  Will Wireshark pick up those packets if the laptop is connected to another port on the routerpli lipWhy would one router pass the packets in both directions, while the other is blocking them one way or the other  It seems if I can answer this philosophical question, I might be able to deduce the real problem.pli ul  pThanks,p  pChrisp

Negative 19633 pI have a MDB that receives messages to process a batch BatchProcessor.  Instead of working on one item in the batch at a time, the BatchProcessor will create a BatchItemProcessor and using a Semaphore will allow a max number of items to be processed concurrently at a time.  The BatchItemProcessors are stateless session beans and injected by the Glassfish container.p  pWe need to send a SOAP message to another service whenever we finish processing a batch item with its status.  The BatchItemProcessor createssends a message to a JMS topic.  We have another MDB, StatusSender, which listens for this messages and createssends the SOAP messge to the other service.p  pThe problem is that the SOAP messages arent being sent until all the batch items have been dispatched by the BatchProcessor.p  pLooking at the logs, the BatchItemProcessors are being created in an EJB thread pool e.g. name from logs codeejbthreadpool10code and the BatchProccessor and StatusSender are created in, what I am assuming is, the Glassfish MDB thread pool e.g. name from log codep threadpool1 w 39code.p  pI am assuming because I cant find documentation to confirmdeny that codep threadpool1code identifies the pool and codew 39code the actual thread.  If this is true, then the BatchProcessor uses a completely different thread than the StatusSender since the thread identifiers are different one for BatchProcess and multiple ones for StatusSender.p  pWhich means Im really confused as to why the BatchProcessor onMessage must complete before the StatusSender onMessage calls can be executed.p  pLooking at my Glassfish EJB ContainerMDB Settings configuration both defaultconfig and serverconfig I have the following which I believe are defaultsp  ul liInitial and Min Pool Size  0li liMax Pool Size  32li liPool Resize Quantity  8li liIdle Timeout  600li ul  pIf someone call help me with this issue it would be very appreciated.  Also, any recommondations for a good resource book, website, etc. would also be appreciated.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pMy issue was related to some code logic which was causing the delay of StatusSender onMessage being executed.  However, I would still appreciate any recommendation for a good reference on Glassfish and threadspools.p

Negative 19633 pHi I am new to String and is reading the article by Martin Fowler a hrefhttpmartinfowler.comarticlesinjection.htmlhttpmartinfowler.comarticlesinjection.htmlap  pHe gave an example of MovieLister using a MovieFinder for finding movies. In this example, he first provided the codep  precodeclass MovieLister...     private MovieFinder finder     public MovieLister          finder  new ColonDelimitedMovieFindermovies1.txt       codepre  pHe pointed out that you cant give MovieLister to your friend for reuse, unless your friend uses the same MovieFinder implementation and put the movies in the same txt file.p  pYes, of course, this is NOT the way you write a component with a hope that someone can reuse it. Instead, as he progressed, you should writep  precodeclass MovieLister...     public MovieListerMovieFinder finder          this.finder  finder              codepre  pYes, that is better. Now your friend can take over your MovieLister and plug in his own code. To me, the story is complete. I miss the point why you need a Spring framework to inject the dependency. The dependency is injected to MovieLister by your friends code. Full stop. All the Spring setup is equivalent to simply implement the MovieFinder interface and make such a callp  precodeMovieFinder myMovieFinder  new MyMovieFinderImpl MovieLister myMovieLister  new MovieListermyMovieFinder codepre  pSimple, easy. I know you hard code the creation of the MyMovieFinderImpl instance in your code. But whats the point of moving this to XML but bringing so much other stuff Since when programmers become so scared of compiling code and prefer changing XML without compiling to get everything done I am sorry but I think I just miss the point. Every program uses dependency inject, decades ago. But in the old days, dependency is injected by programs using a library, or a DOS command line, or a GUI. Why now we need yet another way as to inject dependencyp  pThank you.p  pUpdatedp  pWell, many of you guys brought annotation up. In my sallow understanding of Spring, I may feel more comfortable using XML rather than annotation. At least there is a central place listing how the dependency is, in a way that is easier to understand. With annotation, no such central place. Instead, just magic happening. Wanna know what is passed in as the parameter Go figure it out yourself and good luck. Yes, I know there are smart IDE plugins help  navigate the code. But why we make one thing complicated in the first place and celebrate another thing that helps make our life easier The truth that annotation makes code harder to browse and understand so people create IDE plugins for this is obvious enough that we may create unnecessary things in the first place, isnt itp

Negative 19633 pI have a component package in Delphi XE2 version 16.0.4429.46931, both a runtime and designtime package together. This package has existed for over a year, and the filefolder structure has always been the same. I keep all the units in a dedicated codeSourcecode folder from the root, and the actual packages in a codePackagescode folder in the same root. So the packages are found in codeRootPackagescode and units are found in codeRootSourcecode.p  pToday, after building the runtime package, I was going through the hints and warnings. One of the warnings was thisp  precode[DCC Warning] Inno.TimeChart.pas1 W1025 Unsupported language feature class constructor codepre  pThe warning its self is not what worries me. The problem is when I doubleclick this warning, I get an error message from the IDEp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.come4jcB.png altIDE Error Messagep  pThe one thing which I immediately noticed was that it is not looking in the codeSourcecode folder, but rather directly in the codePackagescode folder. Somehow, the IDE is expecting that the unit be in the same location as the package. Ever since I created the package over a year ago, I have never changed any of the library paths, locations of files, or structure of the package.p  pThe file does exist, but in a different place than it appears to be looking. The file has never been saved in the folder with the projects, and in fact nothing other than the package projects themselves have ever been saved in the codePackagescode folder. This all resides in the codeSourcecode folder, but the IDE seems to think otherwise.p  pWhy would the IDE think this file is in a different folder All the other hints and warnings related to the same unit work just fine when I doubleclick them, but not this one.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pIve created a new test package to troubleshoot this issue.p  precodeRootTestPackage.dpr RootSourceTestPackageUnit.pas codepre  pThe specific piece of code which is causing this compiler warning is in this classp  precodetype   TMyComponent  classTComponent   strict private     class constructor Create   end codepre  pWhen I compile, using Process Monitor, I see the IDE is searching in 30 different places for this file of course failing, it looks like its searching in every library path, rather than in the one place the package says its at.p  pstrongThings Ive Triedstrongp  ol liVerified there is no difference between these paths between the codeDPRcode and codeDPROJcode filesli liInstalled all the latest updates and the IDE FixPack actually gave me new problemsli liMonitored files access with Process Monitor ol liFilters process name equals codeBDS.execode Path ends with codeTestPackageUnit.pascodeli liResult NAME NOT FOUND  Desired Access Generic Read Disposition Open Options Synchronous IO NonAlert, NonDirectory File Attributes N ShareMode Read, Write AllocationSize nali olli liTried with designtimeonly, runtimeonly, and designtimeruntime combinedli liTried with component registered and unregisteredli liTried with directory in library path and not in library pathli liRemoved about 20 unnecessary entries from library path to make it shorterli liMoved directory to top of library pathli liVerified there is no codeDOFcode file associated with project That I think is from older versionsli liRestarted IDE and computer number of timesli liCleaned up compiled and temporary files from project, including BPL and DCU filesli liChanged codestrict privatecode to just codeprivatecode and even codepubliccodeli ol

So can I just open the attachment from the email, and skip the step of downloading it, and placing it on my serverp  precode   handle  fopenupdateaccounting.csv, r          loop content of csv file, using comma as delemiter         while data  fgetcsvhandle, 1000, ,  false          compareid  data[0]         date  data[1]         first  data[5]         last  data[6]         city  data[7]         fundedamount  data[10]         xmlstatus  data[13]         custtestid  substrcompareid, 0, 11 codepre  pMy question is how to grab the .csv file using php running on a cronjob. This way I can use my existing code that processes the file along with what I am looking for, how to automate the process of getting the file.. Any help would be GREAT Thank you so much. Jasonp
Negative 19633 pIve created a simple login system in PHP, however after coming back to my code after several weeks, Im left stumped as to why my INSERT INTO query does not function properlyp  precodequery  mysqlqueryINSERT INTO user username, password, email VALUES username,.md5password.,email or diemysqlerror codepre  pNow, it successfully inserts a row into my user table with the username, but for some bizarre reason I end up with an empty md5 hash, and an empty email field.

Negative 19633 pIm in the process of building a Django powered site that is backed by a MySQL server. This MySQL server is going to be accessed from additional sources, other than the website, to read and write table data such as a program that users run locally which connects to the database.p  pCurrently the program running locally is using the MySQLC Connector library to connect directly to the sql server and execute queries. In a final release to the public this seems insecure, since I would be exposing the connection string to the database in the code or in a configuration file.p  pOne alternative Im considering is having all queries be sent to the Django website authenticated with a users login and password and then the site will sanitize and execute the queries on the users behalf and return the results to them.p  pThis has a number of downsides that I can think of. The webserver will be under a much larger load by processing all the SQL queries and this could potentially exceed the limit of my host. Additionally, I would have to figure out some way of serializing and transmitting the sql results in Python and then unserializing them in CC on the client side. This would be a decent amount of custom code to write and maintain.p  pAny other downsides to this approach people can think ofp  pDoes this sound reasonable and if it does, anything that could ease working on it such as Python or C libraries to help develop the proxy interfacep  pIf it sounds like a bad idea, any suggestions for alternative solutions i.e. a Python library that specializes in this type of proxy sql server logic, a method of encrypting sql connection strings so I can securely use my current solution, etc...p  pLastly, is this a valid concern The database currently doesnt hold any terribly sensitive information about users most sensitive would be their email and their site password which they may have reused from another source but it could in the future which is my cause for concern if its not secure.p

Some posts mentioned about methods being used for transient state only, could someone expand on that  p  pI have seen state being used to mean slightly different things  UIView state and Activity state, what is the difference between the twobr I am also a bit unsure with what they mean by state, when we are saving state what kind of things are we saving exactly, could anyone give some quick examples I dont mean actual code The android developer guides say that the android system automatically takes care of some of this, so what should we be concerned with Bundle objects used by onCreate and onSaveInstanceState only store simple values, so what about more complex objects and arrays.p  pThanksp

Negative 19633 pI am writing quite a large web application for my BSc project and am writing it in PHP using MySQL.p  pWhen creating the SQL tables should I use unique fields The reason I ask this is because I am writing validation methods into my PHP. For example, if I wanted to check if an email address already exists in the database I would first make an SQL statement seeing if any email addresses are returned and then insert the initial SQL data into the database.p  pIf I was to just insert the initial SQL data it would throw an error on the entire statement because email addresses must be unique.p  pIs this the correct way of approaching validationp

Negative 19633 pI have just spent a bit of time figuring out how to insert fillable fields into a PdfPTable using iText.  Through reading the book and googling, I knew that fields should be added via direct content, and as I needed to add fields to specific cells in a table I was building, I should to use a cell event to do this.p  pIn order to improve my understanding, I was hoping someone could confirm that the reason we do it in this way is because the PdfPCellEvent gives us a Rectangle which provides us the exact position of the table cellp  pApologies if this seems very obvious  my Java knowledge has been built up by tackling specific requirements rather than learning it in a structured way so is probably missing some very basic concepts. p
Negative 19633 pI am fairly new to a hrefhttpangularjs.orgcodeangularjscodea and am not able to find any documentation or examples for this.

Maybe something likep  precode    factoryExtendedService, functionhttp         var ExtendedService  BasicService         ExtendedService[methodfour]  function code for method four          return ExtendedService      codepre
Negative 19633 pI often need to draw items in a codeGraphicscode object and the way Ive been doing it is to have a function codeDrawItemcode that receives the codeGraphicscode object and an codeoffsetXcode and codeoffsetYcode parameters, which determine at which point the item will be drawn. p  pThe problem is that the code inside codeDrawItemcode would look a lot better if there would be a method in codeGraphicscode that would give me a version of the Graphics where the X and Y axis zeroes are at some other point, something like codemyGraphics.DisplacedGraphicsoffsetX, offsetYcode. This way I would just pass this codeGraphicscode objects to my codeDrawItemcode method which wouldnt need to receive the other two parameters. Is there such function or whats the closest thingp  pstrongEditstrong On the meanwhile this is what I wrote, but seems like such a basic requirement I still hope there already exists such functionality Id still need to add a bunch of methods but these are all I need for now note the codeDisplacedCanvascode methodp  precodepublic class Canvas      private readonly Graphics Graphics     private readonly int OriginX  0     private readonly int OriginY  0      public CanvasGraphics graphics, int originX, int originY              Graphics  graphics         OriginX  originX         OriginY  originY           public CanvasGraphics graphics  thisgraphics, 0, 0        public SizeF MeasureStringstring text, Font font              return Graphics.MeasureStringtext, font           public void FillRectangleBrush brush, int x, int y, int width, int height              Graphics.FillRectanglebrush, OriginX  x, OriginY  y, width, height           public void DrawStringstring s, Font font, Brush brush, float x, float y              Graphics.DrawStrings, font, brush, OriginX  x, OriginY  y           public Canvas DisplacedCanvasint x, int y              return new CanvasGraphics, OriginX  x, OriginY  y       codepre

Negative 19633 pI am looking to decompose daily sales data with a heavily seasonal component making a 365day seasonality thats too long for an ARIMA process.  However, there are certain parts of the time series explained by other factors, including regular marketing events that affect the data.  I would like to use Rs codestlcode function in a way similar to including exogenous variables in an ARIMA, but I didnt see any place to put exogenous variables into the mix.  Instead, Ive applied the exogenous variables to the remainder portion in a separate regression, but worry that the seasonality picked up by codestlcode would be erroneous due to the said regular marketing events.  p  pAny suggestions on how to get around this issuep

Negative 19633 pI have an assignment to write a signal handler function that catches the SIGKILL signal and displays error messages the first 3 times it is called. On the 4th time that it handles a SIGKILL, it should set the signal handler to default and then send out SIGKILL to its process which it will not catch.p  pI guess to use a loop and display the error messages in the first 3 iterations. Am I right I have difficult to send SIGKILL to its process and set the handler to the default which confuses me.p  pCan you give me advicesp

Negative 19633 pI was reading an wikipedia article on the usage of Bloom Filters . It was mentioned in the article that Bloom filters are used by Google Chrome to detect whether a URL entered is malicious. Because of the presence of false positive p  blockquote   pGoogle Chrome web browser uses a Bloom filter to identify malicious URLs. Any URL is first checked against a local Bloom filter and only upon a hit ,a full check of the URL is performedp blockquote  pI am guessing full check means that Google stores a harsh table of the list of malicious URL and the URL is hashed to checked if it is present in the table. If this is the case , isent it better to just have the hash table instead of hash table  bloom filterp  pPlease enlightened me on this , is my version of full check correct p

Negative 19633 pI want to know if there has beenis any development on Mono.SIMD or SIMDsupport in general inside Mono ever since it came out 5 years ago. I personally think this was a great step in improving speed for c. However, Ive used it for some time now and Im feeling that Mono.SIMD is falling behind, as lots of functions are missing.p  pSome of the problems im facing include p  ol liThe lack of a dot product, which can be implemented in 1 operation ever since SSE4.1 which came out in 2006 and is now supported on 70 of the computers, while it takes 3 operations inside Mono.SIMD. In addition to this, the programmer has to write a function for every version of SSE, a job the JIT should do since it is created specifically to let the programmer stop worrying about CPUversions.li liNo possibility of addingmultiplying Vector4f and Vector4i or any other vectors that are different.li liNo proper casting of vectors the bits dont seem change at all, so the results are very strange and almost entirely useless.li liLots of other function which are not included, such as rounding.li ol  pSo, does anyone know if something is happening with Mono.SIMD or SIMDsupport in generaland if so, what Or, alternatively, does anyone know a good solution for any of the problems mentionedp

Due the amount of messages i send to the server i decided to change the serialization method into something that will result into something smaller in size.p  pI found protobufnet but i only did find documentation about how to serialize a class into a file stream. It seems to me that saving to a file then send it to the server would not be very effective if you send over 100 packages every second. So my question is , how can i serialize a class and save it into an objectp

Negative 19633 pok, here my point, i have a working copy of a svn on a server that must be kept up to date. so i setup a cronjob to update the svn very often. my script just make an svn update at a specific interval of times. i try to use the postcommit hook script on the svn server but did not succeed.p  panyway, my boss ask me to modify the script to make a svn info, and compare the current rev with the rev of the working copy and then if there is a change, then trigger the update. he think that the server load on the svn server will be less that making an update at the same time interval. my tought is that svn update surely does compare but version before updating.p  pi dont have any problem in doing the svn info script but i dont think it will change anything.p  pi look for information about svn update and what it really does, but did not find something helpful.p  pedit Wrikken and Ben, first of all let me clarify my environement. my svn environement is on lan only so we use svn protocol svn. my svn server is an ubuntu server and my client is a debian server. i already have hookscript configure and working on my svn server to sync with a third server that are a mirror of my svn server. my svn server work with user svn. my hook script and my script are own by the same user svn. here is my postcommit script the svnsync command work fine     binshp  precodeREPOS1 REV2 MEwhoami  echo postcommit REPOS REV user ME  gtgt varlogsvnsync.log   non interactive usrbinsvnsync sync noninteractive svnpathtomirrorrepository username user password  gtgt varlogsvnsync.log 2gtamp1 pathtoscriptscript.sh gtgt varlogsvnimpact.log 2gtamp1 codepre  pnow here my script that connect and update the working copy on my second server its only an svn client not an svn serverp  precode binsh usrbinsshpass p  usrbinssh svnipaddress svn update pathtoworkingcopy codepre  pexecuting only the update script work fine with the same user that run the svn server svn but its never been execute when a commit is done.  im kind of lost now.p

Negative 19633 pI am working on a project that generate HTML.

Beside the solution has to transform more than 4000s of different XML files. As the conditions of the HTML view for different products getting bigger, its becoming hard to satisfy using the XSLT Conditional statements and Templates. Its not that flexible to abstract whats common and differentiate across different HTML views. I was thinking to use C to do the transformation instead of XSLT.

Negative 19633 pSuppose that I have a dynamic library .so on Linux.  I also have an existing application that uses the library.  The library is stripped.   I would like to produce some approximate header file for the library, so that I can write another program that uses it.p  pIt is easy enough to use objdump to see what functions are in the library, and ltrace to see every call as it is being made.  p  pstrongHow do I figure out what the function arguments arestrongp  pSome ideas I can probably use LDPRELOAD or dlsym type trick to load a shim library which looks at the stack whenever any function is called in the original library.  I can also probably do something in the shim that dumps the registers this is on ARM, so it would be r0r3 I suppose.  With a bunch more work by looking at the disassembly, it may be possible to also figure out whether a register contains a pointer that would be dereferenced, and then have the shim function dump what is at that pointer.p  pIt seems like a big step from there to this function takes as its first argument a pointer to struct with the following fields...  Are there any automated tools for this kind of thingp  pNote I am not at all interested in how the functions work, just how to feed them the right data.p

Negative 19633 pI am new here and it seems like a great place to get some advice. I have zero experience with backend programming, but I am hoping to understand it better now that I want to compile a simple foolproof database that could end up growing to millions of records if other people are as interested in macroscale concepts as I am. The focus is not on the records  which will contain only a few text strings of unique data  but on dynamic categorization. I would like to create is a page with up to 300 multilevel sortable categories with item counts. When a user clicks a category, all the records are recalculated and new item count is displayed for all the categories. A user can continue filtering through the categories or click on any of the item counts to generate a list of matching records. p  pYou can view a basic outline of my vague idea here a hrefhttpi.imgur.commQluCrv.jpg relnofollowhttpi.imgur.commQluCrv.jpgap  pSo if you were me, how would you structure the database schema to make the simultaneous filtration and count process resourcefriendly Records would be added and updated on daily basis, but it wouldnt be a tremendous load and none of the information is time sensitive. I am used to working with frontend design, so it all makes sense in a visual context, but I have no idea whether its better to create one table with a 100 columns or to use some kind of normalization and indexing.p

Negative 19633 pOk, so Im writing a Node class that is a container for a type Element. Im supposed to write a copy constructor to iterate through the links of Node classes and copy each node.p  pFor the Node class, the only variables are an Element the data contained and a pointer to the next node, and if there is no next node it will point to nullptr.p  pI understand I need to make a deep copy and make new nodes for each of the nodes pointed.p  pWhat I had was something like thisp  precode    NodeNodeconst Nodeamp rhs               elethe element  rhs.ele          next  rhs.next          Node cur  Nodeele          cur.next  next          whilecur.next  nullptr                         Node n  new Nodecur.ele               n.next  cur.next               cur  cur.next                    return this       codepre  pObviously this doesnt work at all. To my understanding, to keep the copies I need to store the new nodes on the heap and keep allocating new nodes until I hit the nullptr, but Im not sure how exactly to implement this. Thank youp

Negative 19633 pIm building a plugin for Bukkit with a number of different classes. The main class loads information from different config files into public variables in the main class.

At runtime, the combobox column has the valuemember and display name as ID and Name. p  pHow can I bind this comboboxcell to the row so that I can later get its selected value p  pstrongUPDATEstrong p  pI did as was commented, and created a structclass that was meant to be the resolution property p  precode Public Class ResolutionStruct  Property Name As String  Property ID As String  End Class codepre  pAnd within the loop I create a list of this class, and assign the values to it p  precode      Dim resolutionList As New ListOf ACTi.ResolutionStruct          For j As Integer  0 To resolutions.Length  1              Dim resClass As New ACTi.ResolutionStruct             resClass.Name  resolutionsj             resClass.ID  resolutionsj             resolutionList.AddresClass           Next          set combocell values         comboCell.DisplayMember  Name         comboCell.ValueMember  ID         comboCell.DataSource  resolutionList          EditCameras.editCameraTableResolution, i  comboCell codepre  pHowever, the comboboxCell doesnt show any value when it drops down. So, now Ive bound the values but it shows nothing. Is there anything else I should be doing so that I get both the holy combo of seeing the values Im picking AND having them be bound to the data grid view Dp  pstrongUPDATE 2strong  So, mea culpa. I was adding the combobox cell to the wrong column p  pSo now, it is showing the values. I click a value, and try to grab the selected value as as string p  precode  Dim cmbbox2 As DataGridViewComboBoxCell  editCameraTableResolution, i                  resolutioni  cmbbox2.Selected.ToString codepre  pBut it still says its a null value Mid build I checked the combobox props. IN fact selected is a boolean as false.  It has no value, says it has no items as well. Any ideas on why it says it is null p  pstrongUPDATE3strong p  pI recently resorted a different column in the table, and the values from the combo box are cleared I guess its really never being attachedbound in the first place. p  pstrongUPDATE4strong p  pFixed it p  pApparently this line       editCameraTable.SorteditCameraTable.ColumnsID, System.ComponentModel.ListSortDirection.Ascendingp  pCaused the table to freak out I can now get the value woohoop

Negative 19633 pI am working with a third party SQLite database. It has a BLOB column that may contain an image, video or audio file. Of course, there is another column that specifies the mime type of the BLOB. My question is, is there a generic way of converting from BLOB to byte array and byte array to blob. I have seen tons of examples around the web but they are specific to images. I am looking for a generic method of working with the blob regardless of its type.p  pNOTE I know it is not a good idea to save these types of files in the db but in this case I have no choice.p

Negative 19633 pFirst timer here, so go easy on me.  Is it theoretically possible to execute two OleDBDataAdapter.Fill calls on separate threads simultaneously  or is that fundamentally flawedp  pConsider a form with 2 buttons and 2 datagridviews.  Each button click launches a worker thread using an Async  Await  Task.Run pattern that calls a method to return a populated datatable and assigns it to one of the datagridviews.  The .Fill in the first thread takes 30 seconds to complete.  The .Fill in the second thread takes 1 second to complete.  When launched individually, both buttons work as expected.p  pHowever, if I launch the first worker thread 30 seconds to Fill, then launch the second thread 1 second Fill, the second DataGridView is not populated until the first .Fill call completes.  I would expect the second datagridview to populate in 1 second, and the first datagridview to populate 30 seconds later.p  pI have duplicated this issue in my sample code with both the OleDBDataAdapter and the SqlDataAdapter.  If I replace the long running query with a simple Thread.Sleep30000, the second datagridview is populated right away.  This leads me to be believe that it is not an issue with my design pattern, rather something specific to issuing the .Fill calls simultaneously.p  precodePrivate Async Sub UltraButton1Clicksender As Object, e As EventArgs Handles UltraButton1.Click      Dim Args As New GetDataArguments     Args.ConnectionString  some connection string     Args.Query  SELECT LongRunningQuery from Table      Dim DT As DataTable  Await Task.RunFunction FillDataTableArgs     If DataGridView1.DataSource Is Nothing Then         DataGridView1.DataSource  DT     Else         CTypeDataGridView1.DataSource, DataTable.MergeDT     End If  End Sub  Function FillDataTableArgs As GetDataArguments As DataTable      Dim DS As New DataTable      Using Connection As New OleDbConnectionArgs.ConnectionString         Using DBCommand As New OleDbCommandArgs.Query, Connection             Using DataAdapter As New OleDbDataAdapterDBCommand                 DataAdapter.FillDS             End Using         End Using     End Using      Return DS  End Function  Private Async Sub UltraButton2Clicksender As Object, e As EventArgs Handles UltraButton2.Click      Dim DS As DataTable  Await Task.RunFunction LoadSecondDGV1234     DataGridView2.DataSource  DS  End Sub  Function LoadSecondDGVpnum As String As DataTable      Dim DX As New DataTable      Using xConn As New OleDbConnectionsome connection string         Using DataAdapter As New OleDbDataAdapterSelect name from products where PNUM   amp pnum amp , xConn             DataAdapter.FillDX         End Using     End Using      Return DX  End Function codepre

Negative 19633 pDuring the past weeks, I developed and published a small OS X utility app that sells for 3 in the Mac App Store. However, due do French export laws for apps that include encryption mechanisms, the app is not available in the French app store. It ships and uses libssh2 and implements SCP over SSH, and therefor does not use encryption mechanisms that are provided by the operating system  the registration process for that is all in French and neither Apple nor the French government seems to be able to help with that.p  pAs I got a bunch of emails asking why the app is not available in the French Mac App Store by now, I thought about offering a nonMAS version of the app. Coming to my initial question, Im not sure if I want to spend time on implementing any kind of license key check etc., or just offer that version completely without DRM  license checks as it surely will be cracked either way. The Mac App Store version is available as a torrent for quite some time now, so whoever wants to steal the app will do no matter what I finally do.p  pSo, Id like to ask you guys how you handle this, or how you would handle this if you were in my situation Spend time on implementing a license key check that will be cracked either way, or just offer a nonDRM version thatll sell in France to make everyone happyp  pThanks.p  pDisclaimer Original thread from HN a hrefhttpsnews.ycombinator.comitemid7796397 relnofollowhttpsnews.ycombinator.comitemid7796397ap  pstrongUpdate to finish this upstrongp  pI finally decided to implement a license validation for the Mac App Store version that is very hasslefree for the user. In the best case, he doesnt even notice this, in the worst case where no receipt is found within the app bundle the app will trigger the storeagent to download the receipt and then successfully relaunch. Pretty simple.p  pFor the nonMac App Store version which Ive introduced because of the French App Store issue explained above I stick with a 3rdparty contractor who handles all the licensing for me.p  pI guess this way is a good tradeoff between security and positive user experience.

Negative 19633 pI am creating a web service using Meteor.p  pI am designing the model, and I have stumbled across a difficult problem Mongo is not designed to work with joins. However, I must logically associate a user with a subscription which is an object that has many properties in it.p  pTherefore, my question is thisp  pShould I embed the subscription model into the Meteor.users collection, or should I create a new collection called Subscriptions and fight my way through manual joins The reason why I am hesitant to use the first solution is that Meteor.users is a collection that is being handled by Meteors Accounts and Password frameworks. Sure, you can embed a profile object upon creation, but how is this method going to scale up afterwardsp  pI would appreciate any insights on this..p

Now the problem is  If I use only one table  tableR and get rid of the table then the touchdragged works as expected. Gives me the proper behavior by selecteing letters between start and end points in lefttoright direction. No I wanted to use tableR as root table and do the rest of UI. So I created a different table  table The above code is when I use both these tablesp  pNow the problem isp  ol lipIf I use tableR.addtable table with letters is displayed correctly but the input functions does not behave as expected. It hits Label although touchable is disabled for labels of the textbutton.pli lipIf I use tableR.addActortable then the table with letters is not displayed properly. Only the 14th top right part of table is visible and it is aligned to bottom left. Rest of the table is just not visible. Input seems to work perfectly for the 14th that is visible.pli ol  pI can share the full code if that would be helpful.p  pPlease help On a side note please tell me if the inputListener table.addListenernew InputListener is the right way to do it. My goal is to display a grid of letters and have the touch behavior like in the wordsearch games on market. p

Negative 19633 pIm embedding several codeJFXPanelscode into a Swing app and the JavaFX thread dies when the JFXPanels are no longer visible. This is problematic because creating another codeJFXPanelcode after the JavaFX thread dies will not start another JavaFX thread and thus the codeJFXPanelcode will be blank.p  pFrom what I can tell the JFXPanel ctor starts the JavaFX thread by callingp  precodePlatformImpl.startupnew Runnable     Override public void run         No need to do anything here      codepre  pLater on once the codeJFXPanelcode has a parent component its codeaddNotifycode method is called which calls coderegisterFinishListenercode which registers a codePlatformImpl.FinishListenercode with codePlatformImplcode. The act of registering the codeFinishListenercode prevents the JavaFX thread from dying when codePlatformImpl.checkIdlecode is called.p  pWhen a codeJFXPanelcode is no longer visible its coderemoveNotifycode method is call which calls codederegisterFinishListenercodep  precodeprivate synchronized void deregisterFinishListener      if instanceCount.decrementAndGet gt 0           Other JFXPanels still alive         return          PlatformImpl.removeListenerfinishListener     finishListener  null  codepre  pWhen codeinstanceCountcode is zero the codeFinishListenercode is removed which causes codePlatformImplcode to call codePlatformImpl.tkExitcode in the following code which causes the JavaFX thread to diep  precodeprivate static void notifyFinishListenersboolean exitCalled       Notify listeners if any are registered, else exit directly     if listenersRegistered.get          for FinishListener l  finishListeners              if exitCalled                  l.exitCalled              else                  l.idleimplicitExit                            else if implicitExit  platformExit.get          tkExit       codepre  pThe only way Ive found to fix this issue is to call codePlatform.setImplicitExitfalsecode at the begining of the Swing app so that the JavaFX thread never dies automatically. This fix requires a call the codePlatform.exitcode when the application exits otherwise the JavaFX thread will prevent the process from stopping.p  pThis seems like a bug in JavaFXSwing interop or at the very least the interop documentation should be modified to address this by discussing codePlatform.setImplicitExitfalsecode.p  pAnother solution would be to allow creation of a new JavaFX thread when another JFXPanel is created but that is blocked by codePlatformImpl.startupRunnablecodep  precodeif initialized.getAndSettrue      If weve already initialized, just put the runnable on the queue.    runLaterr    return  codepre  pAm I missing somethingp

Then I build a table of activites comprising of 2 activity fields and one user field.p  pFor this I need a 3 phase DB access yielding arrays of objects.

Negative 19633 pI am programming an App with Swift, and targeting iOS 7.1 as the lowest, and I noticed that UIAlertView is deprecated in iOS 8. p  pSo does this mean I should ONLY use strongUIAlertViewstrong to display an alert in my app p  por should I use some code that checks which version of iOS is running, and depending on the version of iOS running, use strongUIAlertControllerstrong for iOS 8, and then use strongUIAlertViewstrong if theyre running iOS 7p  pEdit I should add, that UIAlertView does work on both iOS 7 and 8, but I am just wondering if I should use JUST UIAlertView for both, or have a check and run UIAlertController instead if theyre on iOS 8. I know its best practice to use the new API since the other is deprecated, so I am curious if it is an issue to just use UIAlertView across bothp

Negative 19633 pI have a SWT application which displays and sorts image files by renaming the file.  Scruffy I know, but the sortedbyname files are the input for a later step that I cannot change.p  pSo far I have the UI almost working but the initial image at startup does not generate a paint event, so the codeCanvascode is blank.  If I minimally resize the window, it immediately appears correctly.  I am trying perhaps incorrectly to generate the event explicitly using the codenotifyListenerscode method of codeCanvascode which needs to be passed a codePaintEventcode and I am stuck on how to instantiate one.p  pWhat is the correct way to force this initial event to be generatedp

Negative 19633 pIm currently writing a Java application where Im running a primary sever along with a backup one using VMs. In order to get the backup server to take over as the primary if the primary crashes while being completely transparent to the client, I need to get the same application running on both the primary and the backup and both must have the same state. p  pTo do this I have to synchronize the backup with the primary so that it receives the same sequence of packets from the client and sends the same suppressed replies. For this I need to get the initial TCP sequence number of the backup to match up with the initial sequence number of the primary. p  pIn order to achieve this I thought of intercepting the packets to and from the backup server and modifying the sequence number in their TCP header so it matches up with that of the primary.

Negative 19633 pAt this moment im working on a small NodeJs server running on my BananaPi running lubuntu. The server starts as soon as the BananaPi boots and this works I can reach and interact with its API interface. Via this API, I can send a command to start a runnable java jar. This jar should start a few threads which analyze some images. When I start the server myself from the command line, this works perfectly once I tell the BananaPi to start the jar via the API, I can see it running via the process list and the debug log it outputs. p  pThe problem arises when the server is started by the system itself when booting the system. The server just starts normally and behaves the same as when I would start in manually. However, when I give the command to start the jar via the API it just exits after it is started. Ive put some logging around the starting of the first thread which looks likep  precodelogfh, LOGLEVELINFO, Starting Thread 1 thread1  new Threadnew FirstThread logfh, LOGLEVELINFO, Created Thread 1 thread1.start logfh, LOGLEVELINFO, Started Thread 1 codepre  pThe subsequently generated log only containsp  precodeDec 08, 2014 105329 AM project1.MainThread log INFO 20141208 105329 Starting Thread 1 codepre  pIt looks like if the creation of a thread fails, but I cant figure out why, especially since all of this works when I start the server myself.

Negative 19633 pI have been trying to implement backpropagation neural networks for a while now and i am facing issues time after time. The progress so far is that my neural network works fine for XOR, AND and OR.p  pFollowing image shows the training of my neural network for XOR over 100000 iterations and it seems to converge well. For this i had 2 input neurons and a single output neuron with a hidden layer with 2 neurons it [ though 1 would have been sufficient ] img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comhu5iE.png altenter image description herep  pNow progressing forward i trained the same network two distinguish coordinates in XY plane into two classes with the same structure of 2 input neuron and 1 output neuron and single hidden layer with two neurons img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comzre4F.png altDataset img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comvBqqL.png altenter image description herep  pFor the next i trained it for two classes only but with 2 output neurons and keeping rest of the structure same and it did take long this time to converge but it did. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comWhapq.png altenter image description here  But now i increased to three classes class A will be 100 and class B will be 010 and class C will be 001 but now when i train it then it never converges and gives me the following result for the data shown below img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comZfkHG.png altenter image description here img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comCeAoW.png altenter image description herep  pIt never seems to converge. And i have observed this pattern of that if i increase the number of neurons in my output layer the error rate increases like anything Can i anyone direct me to where i am going wrongp
Negative 19633 pI want to do some realtime information extraction from camera input on an Android device. Im looking for some helpful algorithmslibraries etc. to get me on the right track. I dont actually need to do analysis at 1080p30fps, that is simply more information than I need. I will use the colourbrightness data to control some audiorelated things.p  pCurrently this is what I want to dop  ul liTake input from the devices camerali liDownsample to something like 320x240510fpsli liAnalyse each frame as a RGB matrix, so I can retrieve information about overall brightness, and local brightnesscolour of sections of this matrix.li ul  pWould I be best to use something like openCV for this Is this feasible to do in realtime If not, I am also interested in doing this to existing video files on the device.p

Negative 19633 pI have a PowerShell script that grabs file data and generates a checksum script also PowerShell we use to validate UI changes with software deployments.p  pI inserted a switch statement into this script to identify the server type I was running this generation script on and name the outed generated checksum file accordingly. It does so by checking a registry key value on these servers that identifies the server type Alpha, Beta, etc. The switch names are the names of these registry key values. p  pWith this switch statement, I receive a codeMissing statement block in switch statement clausecode error.p  pWhat I noticed when I looked at this script in the PowerShell ISE, is that there is a color difference between the code2008code dark purple and the codeServerAlphacode lighter purple as if the switch name starting with numbers or having the underscores is throwing it off If I comment out those two switches so that just the default remains, it works great.p  precodeserverkey  HKLMSOFTWARECompanyName servertype  GetItemProperty serverkey Server Type.Server Type  file  switch servertype  2008ServerAlpha serverAppChecksumAlpha.ps1 2008ServerBeta serverAppChecksumBeta.ps1 default serverNewAppChecksum.ps1  codepre  pAnd then at the end of the script I have the codeoutfile filecode that will call this switch to see how to out the generated file.p  pAny ideas what I am doing wrong herep

Negative 19633 pI have schemas set up so that I can have an array of complex input sets. Something likep  precodeaddress     street     type String   ,   city      type String   ,   activeaddress      type Boolean,     optional true   ,   ...   people    name     type String   ,    address     type [address],     optional true,     defaultValue []     codepre  pThis way adding an address is optional, but if you add an address all of the address fields are required. p  pThis worked in I believe it was version 4.2.2. This still works on codeinsertcode type autoforms, but not on codeupdatecode type autoforms. Doing an update, none of the fields will submit unless strongallstrong required fields in the nested schema are also valid. p  pFor reference, Im creating the form as suchp  precodeautoForm collectionpeople idformId typeupdate docgetDocument autosavetrue templateautoupdate       gt afQuickField namename templateautoupdate placeholderschemaLabel   gt afQuickField nameaddress templateautoupdate autoForm  codepre  pMy templates codeautoupdatecode I copypasted the entirety of bootstrap3 autoform templates and rearranged some of the html to fit my needs. I updated these to the best of my ability according to the 5.0.0 changelog when I updated. It could possibly be in there if someone can think of an attribute in the templates that would cause inconsistent behavior between insert and update that changed in 5.0.0. p  pstrongMore informationstrongp  pI just tried recreating all of my form templates using the bootstrap3 templates from 5.0.2. Still the same behavior. p  pp  pI have a Boolean checkbox input in the address schema. Looking in a doc, the address array is populated with code[0  activeaddress false]codep  precodeactiveaddress    type Boolean,   optional true  codepre  pNot sure if that helps...p  pp  pAs per marks suggestion, I added defaultValue[]. It fixed the issue... sort of. There are no open nested schemas in the update form now, and other values can be changed. If you add a nested schema to the form with the add button, that entire form becomes required even if you dont insert any value in any field. This happens regardless of the codeBooleancode type input.p  pI can nail down the codeBooleancode type input in the nested schema causes that entire nested schema to become necessary to do the insert. Removing the Boolean input caused it to be insertable again. So theres a new problem in the same vein. p  pThis new issue can be found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions29107559booleaninnestedschemacausingrequiredstatehereap

Negative 19633 pI am planning to develop a new Android app with a camera use case in it. Reading the API documentation it seems like Androids Camera.hardware class has been deprecated and new android.hardware.camera2 has been introduced.

So when I scroll down it will snap back to the iFrame in a certain interval 1 or 2 seconds, not clear.p  pThe reason why Im including the codemodj8j95mcode is I want to lighten the load on the page, because it is heavy as it is especially since they embedded a youtube video which I blocked the frame for with adBlock, which fixes dozens of bogus requests to chromecast, which would slow down the loading of the website to snailspeed.  But it seems it actually loads the whole page anyways, just filters out that codeidcodep  pSo, a couple of questionsp  ol liWhy is it snappingtriggering the codeidcode multiple times li liIs there a way to only load a part of an iFrame even just the download button would be enough in this case, or just the download codeurlcodeli liAnd why does the snapping stop, once the codeclickcode has been firedli ol

Negative 19633 pQuite the mystery here. I have an ASP.NET MVC 4 web application using Windows Authentication that has been maintained for over 18 months without issue.  Recently, it was deployed to a fresh site and Ive encountered the following, very strange behavior.p  pI am using a jQuery 1.8.2 code.ajaxcode call to POST data to the server endpoints to update data.  This works just fine except on one page, where the AJAX POST triggers a new NTLM Negotiation.  The same problem is exhibited in Chrome, IE, and Firefox.  While the issue is the same in all the browsers, it manifests itself in slightly different waysp  ul liFirefox  Received a 401 Challenge response from the server and brings up a usernamepassword dialog asking for credential in an infinite loop.  Canceling the credential checks causes the request to fail with an Unauthorized response.li liIE  No response from the server and the request status shows as Aborted in the Network monitorli liChrome  No response from the server and the request status shows a failure in the Network monitor.li ul  pThe core issue seems to be that the codeConnection keepalivecode header is not being sent with the problematic AJAX request, but is in the other cases.  However, the underlying JavaScript code is nearly identical, and the AJAX calls function properly in a development environment that is also set up to use Windows authentication.p  pAlso, attempting the set the codeConnectioncode request header in the codebeforeSendcode callback has no effect.p  pAny insights into the root of the problem, or ways to isolate whatever difference exists between the two AJAX POSTs are most appreciated.p  pstrongWorking Code and Request Headersstrongp  precode.ajax    url url,    type POST,    data myForm.serialize,    cache false,    success function response         Accept AcceptEncodinggzip, deflate AcceptLanguageenUS,enq0.8 Connectionkeepalive ContentLength621 ContentTypeapplicationxwwwformurlencoded charsetUTF8 Hostwww.xxx.yyy.zzz Originhttpwww.xxx.yyy.zzz Refererhttpwww.xxx.yyy.zzzappresourcepath UserAgentMozilla5.0 Windows NT 6.1 WOW64 AppleWebKit537.36 KHTML, like Gecko Chrome42.0.2311.135 Safari537.36 XRequestedWithXMLHttpRequest codepre  pstrongFailing Code and Request Headersstrongp  precode.ajax     url url,     type POST,     data data,     cache false,     success function data, status, xhr           WARN Provisional headers are shown  Accept  ContentTypeapplicationxwwwformurlencoded charsetUTF8  Originhttpwww.xxx.yyy.zzz  Refererhttpwww.xxx.yyy.zzzappresourceitem1  UserAgentMozilla5.0 Windows NT 6.1 WOW64 AppleWebKit537.36 KHTML, like Gecko Chrome42.0.2311.135 Safari537.36  XRequestedWithXMLHttpRequest codepre  pI have also looked at the network process in the Chrome codechromenetinternalseventscode viewer.

Negative 19633 pI have written an Android app which runs on a custom kernel on Android 4.4 Kitkat device, which uses the Android Serial Port API a hrefhttpscode.google.compandroidserialportapi relnofollowhttpscode.google.compandroidserialportapia in order to open the serial port devttyACM0 which is the port associated with my serial device. The port has the proper 666 permissions crwrwrw, and the app itself even has the  WRITEEXTERNALSTORAGE permission. p  pHowever, even though the permissions appear correct, when my app tries to open said serial port using the library, it fails. In my java code, if I try to do a device.canWrite it returns false, whereas a device.canRead returns true. I feel like this is a symptom of a greater permissions problem.p  pIf I use the sample apk bundled with the serial port apilibrary, I get the same issue, where the app fails at the device.canWrite and throws a SecurityException.p  pThe exact same code DOES successfully run and open when ran on a custom kernel ICS device, for which the app was originally developed for. However, the kernels for both  were written by the same developer, and at least on a surface glance, the permissions on the port seem to be the same. p  pIs it likely this is an issue that I can resolve on the application code side I have tried some other serial port libraries USBSerial3.0, usbserialforandroidmaster and I seem to encounter the same issue. p  pRegardless of where the issue may lie, would anyone have any ideas of what the problem may be Making changes to the kernel, app, and api are all on the table. Thank you.p
Negative 19633 pLet us consider the following problem. We have a system containing a huge amount of data BigData. So, in fact we have a data base. As the first requirement we want to be able to write to and to read from the data base quickly. We also want to have a webinterface to the databases so that different clients can write to and read from the data base remotely.p  pBut the system that we want to have should be more than a data base. First, we want to be able to run different dataanalysis algorithm on the data to find regularities, correlations, abnormalities and so on as before we do care a lot about the performance. Second, we want to bind a machine learning machinery to the database. Which means that we want to run machine learning algorithms on the data to be able to learn relations present on the data and based on that predict the values of entries that are not yet in the data base.p  pFinally, we want to have a nice clicks based interface that visualize the data. So that the users can see the data in form of nice graphics, graphs and other interactive visualisation objects.p  pWhat are the standard and widely recognised approaches to the above described problem. What programming languages have to be used to deal with the described problemsp

Negative 19633 pIm writing a Java component that wraps REST calls to a 3rd party service examplep  precodepublic boolean createuser      send POST request to URL www.something.comcreateuser     codepre  pThere are many possible nodes that provide this service, i.e something1.com, something2.com etc The constructor of this component takes a URL as a parameter and states that it must be a valid URL in the JDoc. Im currently throwing an unchecked exception from the constructor if the URL is completely invalid, i.e zww.broken.com p  pThe caller should tell the user that something went wrong unrecoverable, but avoid crashing the application. i.e I want to catch it, perhaps with an error code, but I only want to catch it so I can translate the error code to a message to display a message to the user.p  pIs it correct to throw an uncaught exception in this situation What if there are other uncaught exceptions that also have error codes In this case Id need to catch all unchecked exceptions in the UI code to translate the error message.p  pId like to learn how to handle this situation in the best way possible, since it seems like an issue that crops up everywhere.

Negative 19633 pI just made the jump from eclipse to Android Studio and Im fixing some issues that have come up. One of which is removing the tab navigation offered by ActionBar and switching to the Tablayout offered by AD support library. I have everything up working nicely, but I cannot figure out how to add menu items to the toolbar when specific fragments are on screen. brbr I think part of the issue is that my MainActivity expands FragmentActivity which takes setActionBar, and the Toolbar is from the v7 support library  so of course that toolbar is not compatible with that method. I tried setSupportActionBar but that is not a method found in FragmentActivity  here Id need to expand ActionBarActivity to access that method, both of which are deprecated class and method.  brbr strongSo the question remains, how to I make my individual fragments update the options available in the options menu of the toolbarstrong brbr strongactivitymain.xmlstrongp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt ltLinearLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid     xmlnsapphttpschemas.android.comapkresauto     androidlayoutwidthmatchparent     androidlayoutheightmatchparent     androidorientationverticalgt      ltandroid.support.design.widget.CoordinatorLayout         androidlayoutwidthmatchparent         androidlayoutheightwrapcontentgt          ltandroid.support.design.widget.AppBarLayout             androidlayoutwidthmatchparent             androidlayoutheightwrapcontentgt              ltandroid.support.v7.widget.Toolbar                 androidididmaintoolbar                 androidlayoutwidthmatchparent                 androidlayoutheightandroidattractionBarSize                 androidlayoutgravitytop                 androidbackgroundcolorblue                 applayoutscrollFlagsscrollenterAlways                 applayoutcollapseModepin gt              ltandroid.support.design.widget.TabLayout                 androidididmainslidingtabs                 androidlayoutwidthmatchparent                 androidlayoutheightwrapcontent                 apptabIndicatorColorcolorblue                 apptabModefixed gt          ltandroid.support.design.widget.AppBarLayoutgt     ltandroid.support.design.widget.CoordinatorLayoutgt      ltandroid.support.v4.view.ViewPager         androidididmainviewpager         androidlayoutwidthmatchparent         androidlayoutheight0px         androidlayoutweight1         androidbackgroundandroidcolorwhite gt  ltLinearLayoutgt codepre  pstrongMainActivity.javastrongp  precodepublic class MainActivity extends FragmentActivity implements     TabLayout.OnTabSelectedListener       private Toolbar                 mToolbar     private ViewPager               mViewPager     private TabsPagerAdapter        mTabsPagerAdapter     private TabLayout               mTabLayout      Override     protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState          super.onCreatesavedInstanceState         setContentViewR.layout.activitymain            unrelated code omitted ...

The code is below together with comments. Can someone point out the mistakes besides using a library for getting the json. I think the data model could be better and not use three different tables. p  precodeimport UIKit  class ViewController UIViewController, UITableViewDelegate   IBOutlet weak var tableView UITableView  This is a the quick fix, another way would be to create a data class with objects and properties name, viewers and image.  Then create an arrray of objects where there are stored.

Negative 19633 pIve been experimenting with querying raw accelerometer data from an Android Wear Moto360 watch but it seems to drain too much battery about 15 per hour. Presumably this is because the Moto360 does not support batching of sensor data.

So far Ive only come across storing activity types and not raw sensor data. I am looking for a battery efficient solution.p

Negative 19633 pI have gridview and the number of cells are around 42 76.  Its a calendar. p  pI want to select multiple cells in gridview with following gesture  1 long click on position 0  change color of position 0.  2 then, drag to position 10  change colors of all cells located between position 0 and position 10. cell color of postion 0, 1, 2... and 10 should be changed p  pI implemented this with following way  1 add a framelayout to each cell 2 implement the gesture and call setforeground of the framelayout during dragging.  p  pThis way works and I can see the color of the all cells are changed. p  pHowever, although I call setforeground of position 0, it does not change.  color of only cell position 0 is not changed. p  pI saw many questions about position 0 of grid view. p  pIn summary, setforground of framelayout in position 0 does not work.  If you have another solution to implement my scenario, please let me know. p

Negative 19633 pI am using admob and to do this I have installed the Google required SDKs via Android Studio. I am using LibGDX so on my android manifest I put inp  precode ltmetadata androidnamecom.google.android.gms.version         androidvalueintegergoogleplayservicesversion gt codepre  pI may have done more steps but anyways, my point is that the ads are fully working, I can see the sample ads from google. However, on my code, whenever I reference the Google Ads service it shows errors  red code. So there it does not finish the code for me when I am typing .AdsRequest etc... but it still works. What could be the problem. Maybe I did not import the library properly Please help. Thanksp
