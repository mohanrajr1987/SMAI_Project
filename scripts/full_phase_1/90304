Positive 90304 pI need a docker container with Tomcat and ActiveMQ. I managed to do this with the usage of supervisord, and the container is working perfectly and all. But then I thought that the concept is bad, since I dont want to lose my activeMQ messages when I deploy a new war in Tomcat.  So I made 2 containers and linked them, one for activemq and one for tomcat.  I can see that tomcat is linked to activemq, but the deployed war in tomcat does nothing with activeMQ.p  pMy question is any tips how can I check why arent they communicating, even if the containers are linked, environments created and so onp  pAlso if someone could link a git hub repo where somebody is using tomcat with activemq linked from 2 different containersp  pAlso if some of you knows a good practice bloog, related to usage of activemq in docker, I am worried about the lost messages when recreating a container.p  pFrom my point of view a docker container is something which should be able to be build from an image in the exact same state. With active MQ this is a bit more tricky, I dont know exactly where does activemq save on the disk the messages, and if a shared volume will fix the persistence problem with docker. On the other hand you dont redeploy that often a container with activemq, but what if it will happen, host restart  destroying all containers.. what are the safety measuresp

Positive 90304 pQuestion is about docker architecture and imo its an advanced question.p  pI have an application running in docker containers. For the sake of simplicity lets assume there is only a postgresql image and a frontend image which are linked together just fine and the application is work as intended.p  pI want to add database dumprestore functionality to the UI.p  pIve read how to dump restore a database running inside a Docker container there are plenty of online sources for that. There are basically two approaches with volumes or with a data container but both methods relies on the ability of running docker commands.p  pHowever I wonder how should I implement it if I plan to add a dump  restore BUTTON to the UI aka inside the frontend container which should have the functionality of being able to save data and give a dump file back to user and reload a data provided by the user via browser interface.  How could the frontend container execute such a function there are some very nasty hacks, like you have access to underlying docker commands from within a container but I consider those security flaws which will be likely purged from upcoming iterations of docker p  pWhat is the correct architectural approach to do such thingp

Negative 90304 pWe recently debugged a strange bug. A solution was found, but the solution is not entirely satisfactory. p  pWe use IntSmarty to localize our website, and store the localized strings in a database using our own wrapper. In its destructor, IntSmarty saves any new strings that it might have, resulting in a database call.p  pWe use a Singleton instance of MDB2 to do queries against MySQL, and after connecting we used the SetCharsetfunction to change the character set to UTF8. We found that strings that were saved by IntSmarty were interpreted as ISO88591 when the final inserts were made. We looked closely at the query log, and found that the MySQL connection got disconnected before IntSmartys destructor got called. It then got reestablished, but no SET NAMES utf8 query was issued on the new connection. This resulted that the saved strings got interpreted as ISO88591 by MySQL.p  pThere seems to be no options that set the default character set on MDB2. Our solution to this problem was changing the MySQL server configuration, by addingp  precodeinitconnectSET NAMES utf8 codepre  pto my.cnf. This only solves the problem that our character set is always the same.p  pSo, is there any way that I can prevent the connection from being torn down before all the queries have been run Can I force the MDB2 instance to be destructed after everything elsep  pTurning on persistent connections works, but is not a desired answer.p

Negative 90304 pIn my a web application, I have a part to invoke an activex control .The Activex control is available in all the client PCs who are accessing my web application from web server. But When trying to run this ActiveX control from the browser in client machine using Wshell, It was not getting invoked since strongRun Activex Controls and Plugginsstrong are disabled in my browser. So I changed the browser settings to strongenablestrong mode and Then the Activex control gave me the expected output. I afraid that this change in browser settings would allow any other website to harm my system. How could I get rid of this problem Any thoughts Thanks in advancep

Negative 90304 pI want to get smarter in AJAX, but not sure which way to go.  I have done some DHTML programming back in the day  like 8 years ago, before it was called AJAX.

When I started with regex, there were justintime regex tools available, like Expresso, etc.  Those were invaluable for developing and learning regex in the early days.

Negative 90304 pIm in the process of testing my Java application on the Mac and Ive run into a very strange issue.

Part of the construction of these mock repositories is that they build out sample aggregates and associated entities and validate them against the same business rules that would otherwise be used within the model.  This also provides a nice and simple means to detect potential impact points within the entities themselves, in the event that their interfaces change.p  pThe main problem that I see with live testing of my SQLbacked repositories is database consistency.  For example, once a test is run the create aspects have already been run.  Running them again would obviously cause failures, as the database is no longer pristine.  I was considering create a mirrored database used just for this type of testing.  It would be minimal, containing structure, programmability, constraints, etc.  I would also provide a minimal set of data for certain established tests.  My line of thinking is that I could have a stored procedure that I could call to reset the database to the pristine state with base data before the start of the test run.p  pWhile this is not as important on a developer machine after the functionality has been initially verified, I am looking more into the importance of running these tests as part of the nightly build so that in the event of a test failure, the build could be held back as to not foul the target deployment environment specifically in this case, it would be the environment that the testing team uses.p  pI do not necessarily think that the platform matters, but in case anyone has implementation specific concerns, my environment looks like the followingp  pWindows 7 Development  Windows Server 2008 R2 Server Visual Studio 2008 Team Edition C Microsoft SQL Server 2008 Standard DevelopmentServerp  pI am using Team Build to run my builds, but that is most likely not a factor in the scope of the question.p
Negative 90304 pIve made my entity classes codeAdresscode, codeRoadcode and codeCountycode. A codeRoadcode is in a codeCountycode and an codeAdresscode in on a codeRoadcode. I would like to list all the codeAdressescode in a codeCountycode. Therefore, in my codeAdressServicecode I sayp  precodepublic ListltAdressgt AllAdressesCounty county    Adress adress  new Adress   Road road  new Road   road.setCountycounty   adress.setRoadroad    Example example  Example.createadress   return ListltAdressgt adressDAO.queryAdress.class, example  codepre  pIn my codeAdressDAOcode I have queryp  precodepublic List queryClassltgt c, Example example    return getSession.createCriteriac.addexample.setMaxResults100.list  codepre  pThis executes the following query on my database serverp  precodeselect this.AdressId as AdressId20,         this.Description as Descript320,         this.DescriptionShort as Descript420,         this.HouseLetter as HouseLetter20,         this.HouseNr as HouseNr20,         this.RoadId as RoadId20  from tblAdress this  where this.HouseNr0  limit 100 codepre  pI had expected it to at least include SOME information about my entity codeCountycode, and an inner join with codetblRoadcode. codetblRoadcode has a primary key coderoadIdcode, so I expected codethis.roadIdcode to be joined with codetblRoad.roadIdcode, and I expected codetblRoad.countyIdcode to be set to the primary key of codeCountycode, that is codecountyIdcode.p  pWhy is the query in this example not built correctly when I use my own entity types If I only use integers and strings, they work fine, but not entities. How do I make joins like this work with my own entitiesp

Negative 90304 pGreetings cake experts, I have a question that I think would really help a lot of people getting started with cakePHP. I have a feeling it will be easy for some of you, but it is quite challenging to me.p  pI have a simple database with multiple tables. I cant figure out how to make cakePHP display the values associated with a foreign key in an index view. Or create a view where the fields of my choice the ones that make sense to users like location name  not locationid can be updated or viewed on a single page.p  pI have created an example at a hrefhttplovecats.cakeapp.com relnofollowhttplovecats.cakeapp.coma that illustrate the question. If you look at the page and click the list cats, you will notice that it shows the locationid field from the locations table. You will also notice that when you click add cats, you must choose a locationid from the locations table. This is the automagic way that cakePHP builds the app. I want this to be the field locationname.p  pimg srchttpimgur.com7pizH.png altalt textp  pThe database is setup so that the table cats has a foreign key called locationid that has a relationship to a table called locations.p  pimg srchttpimgur.comRTMqC.png altp  pThis is my problem I want these pages to display the locationname instead of the locationid. If you want to login to the application, you can go to a hrefhttpcakeapp.comsqldesignerssqllovecats relnofollowhttpcakeapp.comsqldesignerssqllovecatsa and the password password to look at the db relationships, etc.p  pHow do I have a page that shows the fields that I want  And is it possible to create a page that updates fields from all of the tables at oncep  pThis is the slice of cake that I have been trying to figure out and this would REALLY get me over a hump. You can download the app and sql from the above url.  p

Negative 90304 pWhat can I do to avoid the repeated loading of static data every time a page is loaded in ASP.NET MVC2 This is pretty wasteful, and I would like to fix it.p  pMy master page has the typical User Name  Company Name display in the top right corner.  But because of the stateless nature of MVC, this data has to be looked up every single time a page is loaded, even though it never changes.  p  pIn the old webforms days I would just throw it into Session, but that seems to be discouraged in MVC.  Plus the web app runs on a webfarm, so I really do not want to use session.p  pThe web app already has quite a few static data items that get queried on every page load user currency, user tax rate, etc, so I think a performance gain can be made by loading them only once at login time.  Im just not sure what the correct MVC method is I am still quite new to MVC.p

Negative 90304 pMy question might be silly, but Im pretty sure I miss a very important part of the issue. I have to do some object to object mapping between domain classes used in C project and classes which are sent to flash clients.p  pMy first choice was Automapper. But Ive had some issues with it nested properties, not paramterless constructor defined. It turns out that it is not so easy to map a really complex type with automapper.p  pThen my question is Why not implement methods like p  precode  ClassA GetClassAByClassBClassB pObj             ClassA objA  new ClassA        objA.Prop1  pObj.Prop1        objA.NestedType.Prop2  pObj.Prop2        ....Some more.....        return objA         codepre  pIt has exactly the same level of flexibility like mapping done using Automapper. You still have to provide which property from source object are copied into what properties in destinations object. You just do this using  and not lambda expression.p  pBut if you change something in your domain classes you have to change this mapping part anyway. So what is the main thing which should convince me to using Automapper as I said at the beginning Im pretty sure Im missing something important.p

Negative 90304 pI just noticed something particular. I have an internal stock service which is published through basicHttpBinding, and a customBinding httpbinary for which metadata is enabled. I also included a mex endpoint for http. We use Visual Studio 2008 amp VB.NETp  pJust recently we noticed that we were unable to succesfully add a service reference to this service in our other projects. All that it would generate was the first custom exception we included through a FaultContract actually, there was only 1 type. if Id add a simple web reference it would work correctly as well. Also, the WcfClient.exe had no problems either in loading the services. Just VS.NET add service reference wouldnt work.p  pIn the service this exception inherits from Exception and is marked as serializable. Thats all youre supposed to do, nop  pAnyway, this had me baffled. If I remove the FaultContract for this custom exception everything works fine. I can add a service reference, no problem. But is there a way I can still have my custom exceptions Is this a known problemp

Now while debugging the code I get the following exception when my thread attempts to write in the listbox lbChat of frmClient General Exception System.InvalidOperationException Crossthread operation not valid Control lbChat accessed from a thread other than the thread it was created on.p  pSo now the question is how do I work around this crossthread exception How do I pass information chat text from my listener threads and there will be multiple of them in the field, one per client to the centralized listbox lbChat on the form I need some kind of method to transfer information while also reducing the chances of running into contention issues do I need to use ReaderWriterLock, thing is I have no clue how to accomplish this task I thought simply passing in the listbox would allow me to write to it in each of the threads...p  pAny ideas, hints, and help would be greatly appreciated, thanks this is code for clientp  precodeImports System.Net.Sockets Imports System.Windows.Forms Imports System.IO Imports System.Threading  Public Class recieve  Private reader As BinaryReader Private message As String   Private frmObject As frmMain Private readthred As Thread Private Delegate Sub afByVal item As String Public Sub funByVal item As String     If frmMain.ListBox1.InvokeRequired Then         frmMain.ListBox1.InvokeNew afAddressOf fun         frmMain.ListBox1.Items.Additem     Else         frmMain.ListBox1.Items.Additem      End If End Sub Public Sub NewByVal frmObject As frmMain     MyBase.New     Me.frmObject  frmObject     readthred  New ThreadAddressOf runClinet     readthred.SetApartmentStateApartmentState.STA     readthred.Start  End Sub    Public Sub runClinet     Dim client As TcpClient     Try         client  New TcpClient         client.Connect127.0.0.1, 5234         reader  New BinaryReaderclient.GetStream         Try             Dim Path As String             Path  reader.ReadString             frmMain.ListBox1.SelectedItem  Path              frmObject.Playlist.SelectedItem  frmObject.ListBox1.SelectedItem             frmMain.AxWindowsMediaPlayer1.URL  Path             frmObject.ListBox1.Items.AddPath             frmObject.Playlist.Items.AddPath             Try                 While True                     Path  reader.ReadString                     Select Case Path                         Case 1                             frmObject.AxWindowsMediaPlayer1.Ctlcontrols.pause                         Case 2                             frmObject.AxWindowsMediaPlayer1.Ctlcontrols.play                         Case 3                             frmObject.AxWindowsMediaPlayer1.Ctlcontrols.stop                     End Select                 End While             Catch ex As Exception             End Try         Catch inputoutputException As IOException         Finally         End Try         Try             frmObject.AxWindowsMediaPlayer1.Ctlcontrols.stop             reader.Close             client.Close         Catch exx As Exception         End Try     Catch inputoutputException As IOException     End Try End Sub codepre  pEnd Classp

Negative 90304 pI have a pretty big project written in Java using EJB 3  Hibernate and it is hosted on Glassfish server. Now want to rewrite everything and move it to Google App Engine. What would be the easiest way to do it. Should we start using Spring in order to create entities to manage data The reason why we want to move away from EJB  Hibernate is the cpu overhead and the development. It takes up to 10 min sometimes to restart the server to test the changes. We are using GWT for the front end.p

Negative 90304 pIn using Stopwatch.GetTimestamp we find that if you record the return value and then continue calling it and comparing to the previous return value, it will eventually but unpredictably return a value less than the original.p  pIs this expected behaviorp  pThe purpose of doing this in the production code is to have a microsecond accurate sytem time.p  pThe technique involves calling DateTime.UtcNow and also calling Stopwatch.GetTimestamp as originalUtcNow and originalTimestamp, respectively.p  pFrom that point forward, the application simply calls Stopwatch.GetTimestamp and using Stopwatch.Frequency it calculates the difference from the originalTimestamp variable and then adds that difference to the originalUtcNow.p  pThen, Voila...an efficient and accurate microsecond DateTime.p  pBut, we find that sometimes the Stopwatch.GetTimestamp will return lower number.p  pIt happens quite rarely. Our thinking is to simply reset when that happens and continue.p  pHOWEVER, it makes us doubt the accuracy of the Stopwatch.GetTimestamp or suspect there is a bug in the .Net library.p  pIf you can shed some light on this, please do.p  pFYI, based on the current timestamp value, the frequence, and the long.MaxValue it appears unlikely that it will roll over during our lifetime unless its a hardware issue.p  pEDIT Were now calculating this value per thread and then clamping it to watch for jumps between cores to reset it.p

Negative 90304 pI am experiencing a wierd behaviour with jqueryui and jquery .clone , remove. I am using jquery 1.7 and jqueryui 1.8.16. The problem is when i remove an element from a deep cloned element using remove function , the remove affects the cloned element AND the corresponding element in the document by removing the draggable properties from the element in the DOM. Im not sure if im doing anything wrong but it seems to me like either my misunderstanding of how clonetrue,true works or a bug in jqueryui.p  pconsider the followingp  precodeltDOCTYPE html PUBLIC W3CDTD XHTML 1.0 StrictEN httpwww.w3.orgTRxhtml1DTDxhtml1strict.dtdgt lthtmlgt ltheadgt   ltmeta httpequivContentType contenttexthtml charsetutf8gt   ltscript srchttpajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjquery1.7.1jquery.min.js typetextjavascriptgtltscriptgt   ltscript srchttpsajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjqueryui1.8.16jqueryui.js typetextjavascriptgtltscriptgt   ltscript typetextjavascriptgt   document.readyfunction      testp.draggable     the following line causes the draggable classes to be removed from the document     as well as the cloned object ,the expected behaviour is that that testp will be      removed only from the clone...           var test  test            .clonetrue,true            .findtestp            .remove            .end some more manipulation here            ltscriptgt ltheadgt ltbodygt   ltdiv idtestgt     ltp idtestpgtsome textltpgt   ltdivgt ltbodygt     lthtmlgt codepre  pUPDATE It seems that .clonetrue,true still keeps some data shared among the clone and the original.

Negative 90304 pI use haystack with whoosh to search my companys code, every file per index. Most of the time, it works fine. However, when I search with some common keyword like port, the seaching takes 5 mins to finish, and the CPU is 100. I think this is because the result count is too large5000 for keyword port. Indeed, I dont need so many results, maybe 100 or so is enough. How can I set the limit or timeout is also OK.p

Negative 90304 pWere using a hrefhttpsdocs.djangoproject.comen1.4refcontribformtoolsformwizard relnofollowDjango 1.4s new wizarda to create, well, a wizard. We have a wizard where, a few steps into it, the user has to select a row from a listviewdatagridtable. We use a hrefhttpsgithub.combradleyayersdjangotables2readme relnofollowDjangotables2a to show this data.  p  pThe problem is that djangos wizard has a single fixed URL, and uses a hidden form field that tells the wizard at what step it is. So all forms submit via POST back to the very same URL, and Djangos wizard figures out from which page the user comes, stores the submitted data and based on the hidden form field, figures out where to go next.  p  pDjangotables2 is an HTML grid that supports paging and sorting through a set of data. However, it does so using http GET, passing some querystring variables to indicate what column to sort andor what page of data to show.  p  pAs soon as we use sorting or paging in a tables2 grid inside a Django wizard, the GET will call the same URL, because it is a GET, the Django wizard will not receive the hidden form values it expects that regulates navigation, and it will happily show the first page of the wizard by default.p  pIm wondering if anyone has experience with this and knows of a solution to keep both the Django Wizard as well as the Tables2 functional.p  pThanks in advance,p  pErikp

Negative 90304 pI have an auction site that has a javascript timer counting down. For some reason after 1520 minutes this timer is lagging the actual time by 2030 seconds. Over a course of 1 hour the javascript countdown timer can be off by atleast 23 minutes. This confuses users as he thinks there are still 23 minutes for the auction to close.     Once a page loads the server gives the remaining time for the auction which is anything under 2 hours hours amp javascript starts counting down from there. So my question is     1 Why is the javascript countdown timer lagging the actual time by a few seconds to minutes after some 2030 minutes       2 how can i ensure the timer is synchronized. I dont want to use ajax to get remaining time as there are many other ajaxs running. My server uses Php. p

Negative 90304 pIm trying to do this thing that apparently causes a lot of people headaches, and Ive found some nearsolutions, but not quite what I need.  I want to have a left sidebar div and a right main content div.  Beneath those, a footer.  In the sidebar, I want to run a strip from the top to the bottom of the div, filled with a background image, and I want it to stop above the footer, matching the height of the main content div, however tall or short.p  pIf you want to see what Im after, I put up an example page at a hrefhttplumn.netabout.html relnofollowhttplumn.netabout.htmla .  None of the links are active and the code is extremely messy  Im literally teaching myself css just this week.  But at least you can see the layout Im envisioning.p  pIve tried declaring a bunch of height100 from lthtmlgt down through the div in question, and that got it to stretch for the full page, but not to match its parents height.  Using height100 only on the strip div and its parent doesnt appear to do anything.  I also tried positionabsolutetop0bottom0, which, too, did nothing.  The div disappears because it has nothing in it but the background image.p  pThen I tried a jQuery plugin I found at a hrefhttpwww.cssnewbie.comequalheightcolumnswithjquery relnofollowhttpwww.cssnewbie.comequalheightcolumnswithjquerya , but either I didnt know how to call it correctly, or something in my page prevented it from working.p

Negative 90304 pI had to migrate from a older Nexus server to Nexus OSS v2.0.4 today. I have been facing strange issues from the morning. Firstly I installed nexus and started it, and I was able to browse it from the server machine only once and then no more. But later from all other machines in the network I could access the server using a hrefhttpremote.hostname8081nexus relnofollowhttpremote.hostname8081nexusa .p  pThen I copied all the contents of the storage directory from the old server machine and pasted them one by one into the new machine. For every repository, created a repository in the new server and gave the codelocal storage Locationcode as the directory which i copied from the old server. Now I am able to see all the jars which I had, but when I try to use them from maven, I am not able to do so. Meaning, if i try to run a maven project, then it says dependencies not found. I can see that it is looking for jar exactly in the place where it lies in the new server, but fails to download it. Any idea why it is not able to download the jarsp  pAlso I am still not able to access the new nexus server from the server machines browser, why is it so Any suggestions will be appreciated. Thanks.p  pUPDATEp  pWhen I fiddled around with maven, I found that I am able to access the dependencies from public repository, but not from one specific repository only one so far I am aware of.

I thought this is were it may also give windowssqlserver or something to that effect.p  pThe getLicense method does however return null..p  pIve navigated around the EC2 web console, not being able to find this information, but Im hoping that it is possible  otherwise it would mean that you cannot identify the true hourly cost of an particular instance unless you know which AMI was used to create it in the first place plain windows server or windows server with sql server.p  pAnyonep  pThanks p  pGeirp

Negative 90304 pI need to make some operations on a list of files with particular extension .bob, all stored in the same directory. The files are image frames, and their name format is frameXXXX.bob. I dont know the number of frames a priori, and I need to make sure I process them in order from frame 0 to last one. I read the content of the folder with codestruct dirent readdirDIR dirpcode, but since it doesnt guarantee files will be read in alphabetical order even though it always seems to, I want to put them into a single linked list, and then sort them before processing further. I save the head of the list before populating it to a pointer codefilesListStartcode, then read the entire folder content, adding each entry to the list if it has .bob extension. This all works great when I have up to 100 frames, but for some reason breaks down above that  the value of what pointer codefilesListStartcode points at doesnt contain the filename of the first entry in the list anymore. The code doesnt use any numerals, so I dont know what would be the significance of going over 100 elements. I wrote out memory address of codefilesListStartcode before I start populating the list, and after, and they are the same, but values they show at magically change. When I set codefilesListStartcode it points at object with field codefileNamecode equals to frame0000.bob which is as expected, but after populating the list the name it points at becomes e0102.bob.p  pThe list structure is defined asp  precode List structure struct FilesList    char fileName    struct FilesList next    codepre  pThe code in question isp  precodeDIR moviesDir  moviesDir  opendirmovies   ifmoviesDir  NULL    printfMake Movie failed to open directory containing bob framesn    return    struct dirent dirContent    Get first .bob frame name from the directory dirContent  readdirmoviesDir   isBobFiledirContent returns 1 if entry has .bob extension and 0 otherwise while isBobFiledirContent     dirContent  readdirmoviesDir    struct FilesList filesList  struct FilesList     malloc sizeofstruct FilesList     Initialize the list start at that first found .bob frame filesListgtfileName  dirContentgtdname  And save the head of the list struct FilesList filesListStart  filesList  printfFilesListStart sn, filesListStartgtfileName  printfAddress is pn, filesListStart    For all other bob frames while dirContent  readdirmoviesDir   NULL     if isBobFiledirContent         struct FilesList temporaryNode  struct FilesList         malloc sizeofstruct FilesList      temporaryNodegtfileName  dirContentgtdname      filesListgtnext  temporaryNode      filesList  temporaryNode       Set the next pointer of the last element in list to NULL filesListgtnext  NULL   close stream to directory with .bob frames closedirmoviesDir    Check what FilesListStart points at printfFilesListStart sn, filesListStartgtfileName  printfAddress is pn, filesListStart    Rest of the code codepre

I run a cron job every minute to check this database queue and send out any pending emails throttled to my server limits as needed.p  pIt is all working fantastically and has dramatically improved our applications.p  pPart of the feature is it will record when emails are not sent, and will retry again later. As part of the process I update the database to include any error messages during the send attempts, for debugging later. I do this with thisemailprintdebugger.p  pOnce again all working ok normally.p  pstrongThe problemstrong is if an attachment was included in the email, the attachment data is dumped as part of the printdebugger  so my database gets smashed with large text dumps of attachment data.p  pstrongWhat I triedstrong So I went looking in the Email.php class of codeigniter, thinking I could extend the library to just not include the attachment data in the printdebugger function  but it seems that the error that is returned from the function is actually from the SMTP server itself in another function. I cant see a way to stop the attachment data coming through on the error.p  pstrongQuestionChallengestrong Can anyone see a way where I can capture an SMTP error, and the email headers  but not the attachment data Im happy to settle for not capturing any of the email body either since I know what that is anyway in my database queue.p

Negative 90304 pI have created a Jinja2 template called lesson.html that defines the basic structure of a lesson. From that, I derive one child template for each actual lesson since the content of each lesson is different.  For example, intro.html, variables.html, lists.html, and functions.html all derive from lesson.html.p  pAlong with slides, exercises, and whatnot, each actual lesson has a YouTube video.  I want to put the ID of the video in the child template file, but then put the HTML that actually references videos in the parent template i.e., lesson.html to ensure that every video is referenced and formatted the same way.  For example, I would like lesson.html to look likep  precodeltdiv classyoutubegtltbrgt     ltiframe titleTITLE timeTIME srchttpwww.youtube.comembedIDgtltiframegt ltbrgt ltdivgt codepre  pand then have TITLE, TIME, and ID all defined in the child template file itself since thats the most logical place to store them.

Ive looked into doing osmdroid but its very difficult to follow what theyre doing. Ive looked at their SVN repos and checked out their sample app on the Play Store and was disappointed.

Negative 90304 pI have created an application that compare the android phone cpu speed by running the same tasks on multiple phones. I noticed that on the HTC ONE X it becomes much slower if I turn off the screen while it does not change when doing the same thing on the other phone. In the program I put the task in a service and running in a separate thread with priority set to be the highest value 10. p  pI tried to use the partial wake lock to keep the cpu running when screen is off. But it doesnt make any difference in terms of the speed. p  pI understand that different OSUI HTC sense for example has its own power management strategy. But I am wondering if there is any way to overcome it without rooting your phone, means keep cpu running in 100 clock rate p  pUpdates recent experiments show that when screen is off, One X with ICS will reduce its cpu frequency and disable the multicore functionality, the Galaxy Nexus with ICS will reduce about 25 performance, Nexus 7 will reduce about 25 performance most of the time occasionally it can run at the highest speed while screen is off.p

Negative 90304 pI have a structure, that i want to write to a regular file as one record, with comma delimited fields. For examplep  precode    struct A        int a       int b     test codepre  pGiven codetest.a1code and codetest.b  2code, the regular file will have a corresponding code1,2code as one line record. Another requirement, is that i want to write the entire structure with one system call. So, i created a codechar buffer[10]code, stored the value of int a,b into buffer, with comma delimited and a new line character and used Linux system write call to write the buffer.p  pThe problem is that the record ends up as binary in the file. Which is intuitive as i took away the typeness from the variables, the momment i stored them in a char array. I can use standard io, but i would like to learn, how i can achieve the desired results with standard linux system calls with the outlined constraints. How can i preserve the typness of a variable. By typeness i mean that if the variable is of type int, the regular file should have human readable digits.p

Negative 90304 pIm migrating a Backbone basic app to Marionette and I would like to use a hrefhttpicanhazjs.com relnofollowICanHaz.jsa as a template system based on Mustache. br Im using AMD and Require.js and the only way to make ICanHaz.js working with it and Backbone  was to use jvashishthas a hrefhttpsgithub.comjvashishthaICanHaz.js relnofollowversiona. brbr I first implemented the app in pure Backbone style. br  In particular I used to load each template as raw strings with the a hrefhttpsgithub.comrequirejstext relnofollowRequire.js text plugina and then add the template to the ich object. This create a method in ich object that has the same name of the loaded templatep  precodedefine[  jquery, underscore, backbone, iCanHaz, modelsJob, texttemplatesJob.html  ], function , , Backbone, ich, Job, jobTemplate           var JobView  Backbone.View.extend         render function                 since the render function will be called iterativetly                   at the second cycle the method ich.jobRowTpl has been already defined                 so ich will throw an error because Im trying to overwrite it.                 That is the meaning of the following if SEE httpsgithub.comHenrikJoretegICanHaz.jsissues44issuecomment4036580                           if .isUndefinedich.jobRowTpl                  ich.addTemplatejobRowTpl, jobTemplate                           this.el  ich.jobRowTplthis.model.toJSON             return this                   return JobView   codepre  pSo far so good. The problem comes with Marionette. br The previous code works fine in the Backbone version, but there is no need to define a render function in Marionettes views. br Marionette assumes the use of UnderscoreJS templates by default. Someone else has already asked a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11084021howtousebackbonemarionetteitemviewwithmustachehow to use Mustache with Marionettea.br From that answer Ive tried to implement my solution.

I know there are readily available modules such as services, but the developers say service module installed is not much of our help, it is given general data, doesnt allow them to do selected queries, so they have to work on getting data as per app requirements which results in the having to bill for a custom solution...

Negative 90304 pI have a requirement to store events generated by a user identified by emuserIdem. Each user belongs to a company which is identified by emcompanyIdem.

Having said that, I have some questions and concerns and wanted to get some ideas.p  p1 If we have a readusecase that read all data given a time range then with this current design we will not be able to use the rowKey. Instead we will have to do  full scan and filter rows on the timestamp field maintained separately as one of the emattrem columns Am I totally offbase herep  p2 How to handle duplicates I know HBase will in that case create a new version of the row but will it allow reading later on according to the readusecase mentioned in 1 I know you can control the versions when you query but will it be a good design or overloading a native functionality incorrectlyp  p3 This is concerning region server hotspotting. We dont have monolithic keys but we can still run in to this issue if say, one specific company or user is very active. The hashing and bucketing based on number of servers will work not in this case Maybe if we hash on the timestamp field and append that to the rowKey rather than the original value But then the issue would be that scanning on the timestamp component of the key would not be possible. We will have to have a separate column attr in a column to capture that. Any suggestionsp  pThanks a lot for any input comment, link, book, idea that can be provided.p

The problem is I dont pass the session context I get from the URL, throughout the app. Changing to the app to pass the context down would basically mean I would need to rewrite the app.p  pIs there a way I could set this context for a session ie, one call to my API and not for the entire app domain Your help is greatly appreciatedp  pcontext example   db con str   customer log folderp  pstrongEDIT I was thinking I could maybe have a table that links the context information to the thread id System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadIdstrongp
Negative 90304 pI defined a fake view model to be used by a view in a WPF application at design time Visual Studio 2012, .NET 4.5. The view model references an image that is a part of the project content. As long as I put the image in the root project folder, it is successfully loaded at designtime using the following URI conventionp  precodevar Image  new BitmapImage new Uripackapplication,,,MyAppAssemblyNamecomponentMyImage.png codepre  pThe image is marked as embedded resource I actually tried to mark it as content and it also loaded fine.p  pBut I want to use it from the Sample project subfolder, so I changed the code above like thisp  precodevar Image  new BitmapImage new Uripackapplication,,,MyAppAssemblyNamecomponentSamplesMyImage.png codepre  pThen it stops working. Whatever I try content, embedded resource etc., nothing is loaded from the projects Samples subfolder. This is very strange since I see various examples of using subfolders, although I havent found examples for designtime. I also tried to use pack scheme siteoforigin, but then Designer tries to load images from Visual Studio application folder.p  pI saw a similar problem described a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14493106wpfcsharpunabletofindsubfolderimageresourceherea p

I have also read about that and learnt that Android does not support open document format. so that option seems unlikely. But if you have any workaround or a good detailed explanation with respect to adding the JOpenDocument library to the project and displaying rich text then please share that solution because I have searched for it a lot but couldnt find any. p  pThere is also another library called strongOliveDocLibrarystrong to display rich word files on android. here is the a hrefhttpscode.google.compandroidofficedemodownloadslistlinka from where I downloaded the lib.

But am still in search of better options.p  pAny help regarding this is appreciated. Any pointers other than the ones mentioned above are most welcome.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI got a suggestion which told the use of strongApache POIstrongHWPF more specifically in the first bounty I started on this question. After exploring Apache POI for some time, I got few codes which were writing into a doc file, reading the doc file, updating the excel sheets etc.p  pSuch Sample codefor Java which I found off the internet goes something like thisp  precodeimport java.io. import org.apache.poi.hwpf.HWPFDocument import org.apache.poi.hwpf.extractor.WordExtractor  public class ReadDocFile  public static void mainString[] args  File file  null WordExtractor extractor  null  try   file  new FilecNew.doc FileInputStream fisnew FileInputStreamfile.getAbsolutePath HWPFDocument documentnew HWPFDocumentfis extractor  new WordExtractordocument String [] fileData  extractor.getParagraphText forint i0iltfileData.lengthi iffileData[i]  null System.out.printlnfileData[i]   catchException exep   codepre  pSo I added this libraryApache POI to my Android project in eclipse and tried this sample code with some changes. And tried displaying it on a codeTextViewcode. The problem here though is it doesnt display the images like strongOliveDocLibrarystrong does. So if Someone is going to suggest Apache POI, then I request for a solid pointer or a code which reads a strongdocxstrong file and strongallstrong its contentsthat includes images and displays them in a custom view.p  pstrongApache POIstrong is a great thing but sadly I didnt find any good examplessamples implementing those libraries. If you know a good source of examplesw.r.t MS word only then please share them in comments. p  pstrongUpdate 2strongp  pIn strongOliveDocLibrarystrong package the code provided works fine. There is water mark of Olive on the View though. Currently am working on performing codeSwipecode on that code. But the problem remains that its a trial version.p  pstrongUpdate 3strongp  pI think strongOliveDocLibrarystrong is the most efficient way to do it. Though it has a disadvantage of being a trial version, I think no other library does a better job than this library to full fill my specific requirement. The detailed answer has been posted a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma160532092021499belowa. As the bounty time is about to get over. I would request the people who may have an alternate and better solution to post it as soon as possible. For now am going with strongOliveDocLibrarystrong and accepting my own answer.p

Negative 90304 pGreetings fellow developersp  pSince SO was almost always helpful with my programming problems, I decided to sign up and give it a shot with my most recent problem. It really is a strange phenomenon that neither I nor my collegue can figure out. Im sorry I cant provide a working sample, but the project is way to complex to break it down, and specific hardware is needed to run it properly. So Ill try my best to explain it.p  pThe foundation of our project is a native library a 32Bit Windows CDLL in this case to access projectspecific hardware via a Java application a hrefhttpjna.java.net relnofollow titleJNA HomepageJNAa. The purpose is to manage and display the proprietary filesystem of the hardware connected via USB in a Swing UI. This is a pretty common project configuration for us, since we integrated a lot of native libraries and drivers in Java applications.p  pstrongSummarystrong Unittests for enumerating devices work fine. A module of the native library allocates memory and fills it with structs, each containing information for a connected device. It is not good practice, but since we do not have any influence on this part we have to go with it. I mapped this struct in JavaJNA, call the native function, copy the struct content to a Java transfer class and print it in the console. Works just fine.p  pNow if there are UIoperations active while enumerating devices, the native library crashes with an access violation. Even if this UIoperations have nothing to do with the library. The JNA error message shows an EXCEPTIONACCESSVIOLATION 0xc0000005, which SO research revealed as invalidempty memory. p  pHas anyone ever encountered such problems before We certainly never did. It took me days to narrow down the error source to this part of the code. Debugging is not easy when native libraries are involved. Is it possible that there is a JVM memory concurrency problem Since the native library allocates memory by itself and the JVM doesnt know anything about it  so the JVM tries to allocate memory for new Swing components in already used memoryp  pstrongCodestrong  The following snippet is from my unittest, broken down as far as possible. The intended sequence is obvious Remove nodes from the rootnode, load connected devices and add these devices as new nodes. This code crashes with an access violation, but NOT AT THE NATIVE CALL  it crashes as soon as I access tree components.p  precode    public void loadDevices         SwingUtilities.invokeLaternew Runnable              Override             public void run                  rootNode.removeAllChildren                 rootNode.addnew LoadingNode                 tree.expandPathnew TreePathrootNode                                final ListltDevicegt devices  lib.loadDevices  wrapped native call          SwingUtilities.invokeLaternew Runnable              Override             public void run                  rootNode.removeAllChildren                 ifdevices.isEmpty                     for Device dev  devices                           DevNode node  new DevNodedev                         rootNode.addnode                                                                    codepre  pNote The emDevNodeem does not contain any native data, the content of each native struct is copied to a Java transfer object. The GC should not have issues when trying to move object data, because all unmanaged code is handled locally in the emlibloadDevicesem method.p  pWhen I remove the calls to the emSwingUtilitiesem completely and print the resulting device information to the console instead of creating nodes, this part works fine.  As soon as I try to access the emJTreeem or emTreeModelem members, the code crashes. It doesnt metter if I do this in a call to emSwingUtitiliesinvokeLaterem or in the same thread.p  pI know this is a very specific problem that hardly anybody would be interested in what makes it really hard to search for solutions in SOGoogle. But maybe I am lucky and somebody has already encountered this problem.p  pSo longbr xanderp  pstrongEditstrong Originally this code was wrapped in a worker thread, leading to the same results. This is just a snippet of my unittest.p  pstrongEdit 2strong It seems I didnt make myself clear enough or forgot to mention something important here, sorry. The access to the tree or its model doesnt necessarily have to do with the native library. Look at the code again The first call to invokeLater does nothing but remove nodes from the tree. Even when I remove the second call to invokeLater, the native library crashesp

Negative 90304 pDoes anyone know how to view an existing IMvxViewModel p  pIn my app, I have already created a bunch of ViewModels PhotoViewModel inside of another view model. They exist as a property on the parent ViewModel AlbumViewModel. It would be very nice to just show a particular instance of a PhotoViewModel instead of creating a new instance of that view model when I want to view it. p  precodepublic class AlbumViewModel  MvxViewModel      public ObservableCollectionltPhotoViewModelgt Photos              get  return GetValue gt Photos          set  SetValuevalue,  gt Photos         public class PhotoViewModel  MvxViewModel   codepre  pI was wondering if there was a way, other then creating my own IMvxViewModelLocator, to accomplish this task. I think having a protected method on the MvxNavigationObject called View could be really helpful both for new developers using the framework as well as performance. Wed be able to skip all of the reflection done currently to instantiate a view model.p
Negative 90304 pI have an Amazon AWS and I want to install both Wordpress and Rails on this same server using Apache. I know that we can do this by configuring Apache virtual host.

And when an user signs up, I also want to give him a unique subdomain such as codeuser1.example.comcode, codeuser2.example.comcode, etcp  pHow can I achieve such things I am thinking about using some rewrites to redirect .example.com to Rails app but I dont really know how.p  pThanks in advancep
Negative 90304 pI often configure WordPress installations for lesstechnical people and find that the first important task is to remove unnecessary items from the admin panel, however this becomes increasinglydifficult to manage when plugins get enabled and the lockeddown users need access to its functions.p  pGenerally, I create a new Role from scratch using members plugin and disable things from there.p  pThe problem is that to allow a lockeddown user to access the settings for a plugin to emaddem an item to their admin menu I generally have to find the codeaddmenupagecode function and change the capability to one I know the lockeddown user will have which, while good for allowing users access based on capabilities, makes little sense when I just want to allow the Role access to the menu.p  pMore importantly, however, I dislike having to edit a plugins code particularly as it requires readjusting with each plugin update. Is there a cleaner way to achieve this or am I just approaching this issue in the wrong wayp

Maybe both should have separate listeners. But i am not being able to figure out how. p

Negative 90304 pIm having an issue that is more bemusing to me than anything. Im trying to establish a socket connection in ObjectiveC using GCDAsyncSocket. My connectToHost message sent to my GCDAsyncSocket fails with an EXCBADACCESS if and only if the socket variable is called codesocketcode. Its not a emproblemem, exactly, because its easy for me to use a different variable name, but Im curious as to why that would happen.p  pHere is what I believe is the relevant portion of my code, from a class I created called SocketManager. Most of the code is taken from the a hrefhttpsgithub.comrobbiehansonCocoaAsyncSocketwikiIntroGCDAsyncSocket relnofollowGCDAsyncSocket introa. The code below fails with EXCBADACCESS at the indicated line.p  precodeimport SocketManager.h import GCDAsyncSocket.h  implementation SocketManager  GCDAsyncSocket socket  id init      self  [super init]      socket  [[GCDAsyncSocket alloc] initWithDelegateself delegateQueuedispatchgetmainqueue]      NSError err  nil       EXCBADACCESS happens at the line below     if [socket connectToHostlocalhost onPort26400 erroramperr] NSLogI goofed , err      NSLogjust created socket      return self  codepre  pHowever, if I change the variable name from codesocketcode to codesockcode or codebananacode or any other name, the code runs fine, which kind of weirds me out. Why would that happen Is codesocketcode some kind of reserved system word If thats the case, I would expect the code to not compile at all, but Im pretty new to ObjectiveC.p  pIncidentally, my codedidConnectToHostcode delegate method is rarely ever called, which I think is a separate issue but for all I know, it could be related.p

Negative 90304 pI have a method that occasionally crashes.p  precodevoidfoo     [self doSomething]     [self.delegate didFinish]     [self doSomethingElse]  codepre  pdoSomething works correctly, then I call to a delegate didFinish. Within didFinish, the reference to this object might be set to nil, releasing it under ARC. When the method crashes, it does so on doSomethingElse. My assumption was that self would be strong within a method, allowing the function to complete. Is self weak or strong Is there documentation on this What would the reasoning be for it being strong or weakp  pstrongEditstrongp  pUpon being inspired by some of the answers below, I did some investigation. The actual cause of the crash in my case was that the NSNotificationCenter does not retain the observer in any case. Mike Weller indicates below that callers of methods should retain the object while it is being called in order to prevent the case that I described above, however it appears that NSNotificationCenter ignores this issue, and always maintains a weak reference to the observer. In other wordsp  precodevoidsetupNotification     observer is weakly referenced when added to NSNotificationCenter     [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserverself                                              selectorselectorhandleNotification                                                  nameSomeNotification objectnil]   handle the notification voidhandleNotificationidnotification     owner has reference so this is fine     [self doSomething]     call back to the ownerdelegate, owner sets reference to nil     [self.delegate didFinish]     object has been dealloced, crash     [self doSomethingElse]  codepre

Each section of the site has its own html file to keep things simple...

I have attempted to specify a class for such a function a few ways, but I dont know jquery at all and either way I setup the CSS, it fades the button completely out to an opacity of 0 instead of the active pages button being in the blue state. So whats the proper way, given this particular structuring, to specify the active class in the CSS amp the pages corresponding li elementp  pThank you in advance for any help on this subject.p

Negative 90304 pI am working on VB.NET application that uses the MS Speech Platform 11 SDK.  I have noticed a problem with the MS Helena Spanish voice when playing Spanish text as audio. If the text contains a question, that is, text enclosed with an upsidedown and a normal question mark, the audio is not spoken with the intonation of a question.  When I use the MS Helen English voice, the text is spoken using the intonation of a question as you would want.  I have tried getting around this by adjusting different attributes such as pitch for the Spanish but have not had any success so far.  I will continue to investigate.p  pPlease let me know if you have any questions or need further information.p  pThanks, Gilp

Now, if I click on a emnewem route say companies D, E, F, heres what happens to the best of my knowledgep  ul liNothing happens until the promise resolves and the new companies are loadedli liAs soon as theyre loaded, the codecompaniescode template gets rendered.

If it was instantaneous, perhaps it wouldnt matter, but because it has a smooth animation its noticeable.p  pI thought using codeEmber.run.oncecode would prevent this from happening, but I guess not  or Im using it incorrectly. It seems like what I need is to check not only whether the model is loaded, but whether the controller has finished swapping out its content. I would greatly appreciate any ideasp

Negative 90304 pI saw a similar question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1678494whydoesfirebugaddtbodytotableherea, but was not sure of a solution, and the circumstances are slightly different, so I thought I would ask it again.p  pI have a page that has both PHP and JavaScript. The PHP retrieves info from a database, and creates a checkbox using it. This checkbox is wrapped inside a table for correct formatting. There is a button on the page, and when it is pressed, JavaScript creates a new checkbox, with the same formatting as the one created in PHP. I have some code that allows me to see if any of the checkboxes are pressedp  precodealertselectedCheckBoxWrapper.firstChild.firstChild.firstChild.checked codepre  pAs you can see the code attempts to look inside the codelttablegtcode wrapper and find out if the checkbox is checked or not.

Negative 90304 pI am wanting to setup a new library in Windows 7 for our users, however the Libraries cannot accept a variable in the path.P The library I am trying to setup is Downloads and I want it to point at tempDownload.

Negative 90304 pIm working with codeUILocalNotificationcode and I would like to notify one of my controller that the notification has been received even if the app has been terminated.p  pIn my appDelegate I implemented this functionp  precodevoidapplicationUIApplication application didReceiveLocalNotificationUILocalNotification notification      if [application applicationState]  UIApplicationStateInactive          [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] postNotificationNamelocalNotificationReceived objectnotification.userInfo]       codepre  pIn my codeUIViewControllercode I implemented the observer on the codeviewDidLoadcode methodp  precode voidviewDidLoad      [super viewDidLoad]      [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserverself selectorselectordidlocalNotificationReceived namelocalNotificationReceived objectnil]      codepre  pIt works perfectly when the app run in background. Since the codeviewDidLoadcode method has already been called and the Observer is waiting..p  pThe issue is when I kill the app. Then the observer of my controller is gone and the codedidlocalNotificationReceivedcode method is never called.p  pI think that its because when I receive the codelocalNotificationcode and run the app again. The codedidReceiveLocalNotificationcode method is called before the codeviewDidLoadcode of my codeUIViewControllercode. Then the observer is created after the codePostNotificationNamecode then the observer receives nothing.p  pI would like to know if there is some best practices or pattern to handle this kind of issue.p  pI know that the codedidFinishLaunchingWithOptionscode method is called before codedidlocalNotificationReceivedcode so there is probably something to do there.p  pUPDATE p  pI also discovered that when is app is terminated. Once you tap the notification, It opens the app, call the function codedidFinishLaunchingWithOptionscode but never call codedidReceiveLocalNotificationcode. So I think that Im gonna handle both cases differently.p
Negative 90304 pAlright, Im about to do something I hate, because my issue is requiring me to post my code unadulterated. p  pThis is for a homework assignment. ALL I need to do for this half of the project is read in data from a file, store it, and print the data back out. The data found here www.gamefaqs.comps2459841finalfantasyxiifaqs42703 just incase Ive missed something about the data is just a list of rare spawns from Final Fantasy 12. Theres s series of entries, which I have a set of loops in place to take apart and cobble into a pair of arrays. p  pThe problem is that several of the entries are giving me issues with either printing data its not supposed to, or putting data in the wrong spots. Several of the entries, where a series of asterisks denotes the difficulty of the monsters is supposed to be converted into a numerical format based on the size of a temporary variable that the asterisks are put into, are instead reading a DIFFERENT variable not all of them, just some of them. Further, entries 51 and 65 arent trashing everything they are supposed to, and instead kicking back stuff I DONT want printed.p  pAll its supposed to do is take in vital stats about the mobs Name, HP, XP, LP, its weakness, what drops when it dies, what can be stolen, what is gotten from a Poach attempt, the original sprite used, how tough it is[scale of 15], and where it spawns at. Everything else is supposed to be thrown out. After that, its supposed to print the stats Ive told it to, and in the order I specified. It works for most of them.p  pIve gone through the code a dozen times with the Debugger, and Im still not even sure exactly where its buggering up. Even so much as a simple look at this part of the loop would help tremendously.p  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltstringgt include ltfstreamgt include ltiomanipgt  using namespace std  void

Negative 90304 pIm currently working on a class that aims at supporting thread priorities for my boostthreads. Ive already implemented the code for OSX. I Need 9 priorities so I spread the values smoothly between 15 and 47 because pthreads schedgetpriorityminmax on OSX returns 15 and 47. Now to the Windows part. How do you recommend to use the priority classes and their respective priority values from IDLE, LOWEST, BELOWNORMAL ... up to TIMECRITICAL By now Im tending to go with changing the priority classes over changing the priority values because I think the latter might be too fine grained. On the other hand, the THREADPRIORITYNORMAL values might be dangerously high in the REALTIMEPRIORITYCLASS. Maybe doing a little mix of both could be the right way to do it Further Im wondering which priority class and priority value a common boostthread has  Am I right in assuming NORMALPRIORITYCLASS and THREADPRIORITYNORMALp  pThanks alotp

If I display the stored data in a HTML page and then send the link to the testing team then they will see codenullcode, as localstorage stores data locally.

Negative 90304 pI am adding a new attribute to a DataList control in asp.net. I want to set the attribute on the server in C.

On the client, I use .attr in jQuery to modify the value. During the postback on the server, I use DataList.Attributes[attributeName] to get the new value, but its null.

Negative 90304 pWe have a Windows Azure cloud service application i.e. ASP.NET MVC web application which is hosted on production slot and uses SSL , it also has ACS configured on it.p  pI want to deploy the same application on the Staging slot of the cloud service where we have this GUID.cloudapp.net.

How can I fix thisp  pBy the way, Im only working in Chrome, hence the lack of nonwebkit prefixes.p  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netUsETm relnofollowFiddle.ap

In this particular case I am having trouble declaring my google map object to grab my current location data.p  h2Here is the relevant codeh2  precodepublic static class GpsClass extends Fragment     View rootView     private GoogleMap mMap      public static final String ARGSECTIONNUMBER  sectionnumber         public View onCreateViewLayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container, Bundle savedInstanceState         if rootView  null                 ViewGroup rootView.getParent.removeViewrootView                          try                 rootView  inflater.inflateR.layout.gps, container,false                 mMap  SupportMapFragmentgetActivity.getSupportFragmentManager.findFragmentByIdR.id.mymap.getMap                 mMap.setMyLocationEnabledtrue               catchInflateException e                           return rootView               codepre  pIn this codes implementation I get a Null Pointer exception when I try to declare mMap. If I remove the emgetAvtivityem call the eclipse tells me I cant make a static reference to a nonstatic method. If I remove the mMap lines my app works with a google map in one tab the other tabs implement other things which all work. p

Negative 90304 pi have the project requirement in which i want to make an instant messaging app in androidiphone and may be in future it supports voip and video chatting.p  pNow i have 2 choicesp  p1 xmpp  it is application layer protocol for IM, which is almost 10 year old, and it has lot of extensions which support voip or may be video chatting, onlineoffline status and lot of other features. It is accepted by all big companies like whatsapp,fb,Skype etcp  pAlso I heard that google has moved away from this protocol because of vulnerability.p  p2 websocket  it is tcp layer protocol which provides a full duplex communication over a single tcp connection and its new and it was standardised by IETF in 2011.i dont know whether this protocol is mainly used for IM. but i know that it can be done as it is in tcp layer. And i didnt saw or heard any featuresextensions of web socket other than the 4 methodsi.e onOpen, onClose, onMessage and onError. so it means if i choose this i have to make my own methods of onlineoffline statusmay be sending a frame in every x secondsminute, voip, message delivery information and other features etc.p  pI am confused, which one i choose, xmpp or web socket, in terms of development, server handling cost, security, session handling management, browser support etc.p  pstrongIf i am wrong anything about these 2 protocols then please correct me.strongp  pTHANKS IN ADVANCEp

Negative 90304 pI have seen in several places, including the source code of CCSpriteBatchNode that it is expensive to addremove childs from it.  My understanding is that the whole point of using batch nodes is to prevent expensive OpenGL calls from happening over and over when many sprites from the same sprite sheet are being added to the same container.p  pWhat I am wondering is 1 how expensive is adding  removing childs to a sprite batch node, and 2 when is it considered a appropriate to make use of onep  pFor example, I have a laser object which creates ten sprites...  as it moves across the screen, it showshides the current sprite for that given screen position.  When it reaches the far right edge of the screen, the laser object is discarded, and so are the ten sprites.  So, I was wondering, is this a case where a sprite batch node would be not appropriate to use because its only 10 sprites, and it happens so fast  The move animation is 0.2 seconds, so that if the player were to rapidly fire, that would mean addingremoving 10 sprites to a batch node over and over...p  pIn other cases, I have a SpriteBatchNode already setup for various objects, and occasionally I come across a oneoff sprite that needs to be added, and it just happens to be part of the same sprite sheet, so I am tempted to add it to that batch node since its there, and its designated to that particular sprite sheet already......  Anyway, Id love to get some clarification on this topic.p

Since Im using multiple technologies to store data and snychronize processes mongoDB, MySQL, activeMQ, ..., I want to use Apache camel to deal with all the different technologies.  The problem is that there is no possibility I know of to nicely integrate Camel with the Java approach on REST The whole mapping of methods and classes to HTTP requests is done with Annotations.  So the only possibility for me was to write methods which would place parameters of the request in the exchange headers of Camel and fire them to the route.  To avoid this I wanted to automate this process by defining those classes at runtime from the route definitions.p

Negative 90304 pIm quite a beginner in the project architecturing  structuring side of things.p  pThe overall project currently looks likep  ul liroutehome.jsli liserviceappService.jsli limodelsappModel.jsli ul  pIn the route file, I require appService.js. appService.js takes care of some API calls to external services, such as getting an accesstoken from such API service.p  pWhen I receive the access token, a callback is made in appService which calls appModel appService requires appModel.js, and in turn appModel stores the access token in the database. Then, another callback is called in appService which in turn does runs the callback that the route page provided, then  I make a redirection.p  pI am using mocha for testing the service and model files. My service file is requiring the model file, so when I create a mocha test for the service file, the model is called indirectly as well.p  pShould I require the model in my route file instead of the service file, and run the model function in the route, once I receive the access token response from the API in the service file What do you suggestp

Negative 90304 pLet me first frame my situation. I have a ViewController, which retains an instance of a codeGameManagercode. The codeGameManagercode class encapsulates the state and logic of a simple game. When certain states are encountered in the codeGameManagercode, I would like to perform a set of actions. For instance when a game is over, I would like to display a game over dialog. As mentioned above, the game logic resides in the codeGameManagercode, but the method to create and position a new game over dialog resides in the ViewController. To allow for the codeGameManagercode to call back into the ViewController, I passed a reference to the ViewController to the codeGameManagercode when allocated, and simply invoke methods on the ViewController. For examplep  precode GameManager.m  void gameOver      [self.viewController showGameOver]  codepre  pMy question is Is this the proper, objectivec way to do this Is there a purer way to handle this Ive though using blocks may be more appropriate.p

Negative 90304 pI am working on a project requiring communication between the Presentation layer MVVM based client and the Business layer. The application is to be installed on a single machine, and as such could have been executed using a .net remoting based approach. However, I have been suggested to use WCF since .net remoting is deprecated and WCF is the way to go.p  pSo I implemented WCF Service as a WCF library project. I added a service reference using visual studio tool by discovering services in the solution, which was successfully added on the client side. All works well, since during debug session visual studio launches the service library and the client can connect to it successfully. p  pNow Since the client and service host will be installed on same machine, I was thinking of using named pipes transport and self hosting for the WCF service. Here is where this gets very confusing to mep  ol liSince the MVVM client is the main app since it is the application frontend, the client will be launched first. I am unable to come up with a solution to launch the service host ondemand when the client needs the same.li liWhat are the solution I can use to do what I require for 1 I am not sure of using a continuous service through windows service for something that will be required ondemand.li liPlease suggest clean approach to implement a way to launch ondemand service. Thanks in advance. li ol

Win7 users still need to have installed the DirectX SDK versions of d3d11.dll etc.li liAttempting to put the DirectX June 2010 SDK in the include path to get a version of XAudio2 that will work, results in macro conflicts, e.g. between dxgitype.h and winerror.h. It seems Microsoft moved a large number macros into winerror.h, and there is no preprocessor check before attempting to define them...li liThe DirectXMath headers appears to only be in the Windows8 SDK headers, they have no issue with the Windows 7 WIN32WINNT0x0601, but this fact prevents me going to an older SDK without the winerror.h crap...li ul  pI am wondering if I can hack it by undefing WIN32WINNT to include the Win8 XAudio2 then cloning the DirectX SDK versions inline COM wrappers, but that leaves me exposed if any of the XAudio2 public interfaces actually changed e.g. structure layouts or new members.p  pThere must be a proper way to do this...

Negative 90304 pI have a PHP script with HTML forms for user to pick several things, after that it communicates with database and prints out the result in the form of a table. Everything is formatted with CSS.p  pNow I would like to make those results also saved in an xls file, ideally using some sort of a Save file button appearing after the script finish its work. For that to work though I have to use PHPExcel write commands in several different parts of the script. But those parts are also responsible for the output on the website.p  pI have tried using PEAR and recently also PHPExcel and I think I can make it work with saving the file on the server, but I couldnt do it with sending to browser option so popping up message with Save file as.... When I try to do it that way, it prints out all kinds of gibberish signs on the website and doesnt pop up with save file option at all. I found out this is  because I am printing and echoing all sort of things in between the PHPExcel write commands, but I am not sure how to do it differently.p  pSo I guess my question is Is it possible in PHPExcel or any other library to use its write commands all over the PHP script with all sort of echos and HTML code in between while using the send to browser optionp  pThanks you in advance for answers and help.p

Even just using the basic code, I get an error and an empty plot imagep  precodegt ggbiplotpca Error invalid rot value codepre  pWhat does this mean, and how can I fix it Does it have something to do with the nonscale in making the PCA, or is it something different It must be something with my data, I think, since if I use a standard example code below I get a really nice PCA plot.p  precodegt datawine gt wine.pcaprcompwine,scale.T gt printggbiplotwine.pca, obs.scale  1, var.scale  1, groups  wine.class,    ellipse  TRUE, circle  TRUE codepre  p[EDIT 1] I have tried subsetting my data in two ways 1 remove all columns were all rows are 0, and 2 remove all columns were any rows are 0. The first subsetting still gives me the codescalecode error, but not the ones that have removed columns with any 0s. Why is this How does this affect my PCAp  pAlso, I tried doing using the normal codebiplotcode command for both the original data nonscaled and the subsetted data above, and it works in both cases. So its something to do with with codeggbiplotcodep  p[EDIT 2] I have uploaded a subset of my data that gives me the error when I dont remove all the zeroes and works when I do.

Negative 90304 pI find it convenient to and have a lot of code which wrappers some storage object in an allocation adapter, and then this allocation adapter is used commonly to scope the guaranteed backstore in a managing object for its lifetime, which is normally the lifetime of the function call.p  pThis seems to be using a nonstandard VisualStudio extension, however, and Im curious as to what is a better paradigm and why..p  pe.g. a lot of our code still uses codeCStringcode.  One of the features of a codeCStringcode is the ability to lock its contents so that you can take a nonconst pointer into the underlying buffer and manipulate it directly  ala C library functions.p  pThis makes it very easy to use a codeCStringcode for its automatic resource management, but still interface to legacy libraries  code which needed a writable character buffer.  However, locking the buffer is not itself an RAII operation, so I made an RAII class to perform that function like taking on a lockp  precode replaces each occurrence of any of the given list of characters with a specified replacement character inplace inline void ReplaceAllCStringW amp str, const wchart  chsOld, const wchart chNew      ReplaceAllmakeautobufferstr, chsOld, chNew  codepre  pThe code behind makeautobuffer is rather longwinded, but the idea boils down to returning an object that holds a lock on the underlying strings buffer, and will ask the str to release that buffer lock on its destruction, thus releasing the buffer back to control by the CString.p  pThis is a trivial idea, and the implementation is fairly trivial as well lots of boiler plate to make it robust wrt widenarrow strings, and variations that take a fixed buffer size or not, and some debugging helpers, etc..  p  pBut more generally speaking, I have often found it very useful to have a class which takes a nonconst reference to an instance of something, and wrappers that instance in some sort of mutable adapter layer, and then releases the underlying entity upon termination.p  pThe question is whether there is a better way to accomplish this than having to create a named variable to do the adaptationp  precode replaces each occurrence of any of the given list of characters with a specified replacement character inplace inline void ReplaceAllCStringW amp str, const wchart  chsOld, const wchart chNew      auto adapter  makeautobufferstr     ReplaceAlladapter, chsOld, chNew  codepre  pThis works, and doesnt violate the standard.  Im no longer trying to pass a nonconst object by ref from a temp object  since Ive forced the temp object into being less temporary by naming it.p  pBut... that seems silly.  At the end of the day, doing the above doesnt change the meaning as far as I can tell.  And if the VisualStudio allowance was nonstandard, then is there a better standard way that isnt so sillyp

Then if type or paste to the textBox c12345 it will create it fine since all the directories 1234 already exist so it will create directory 5 not problems. p  pFor some reason it dosent understand or know to create the childsub directories if some of them not exist yet already. It will not create c12345678 it will not create directory 8 if 1234567 already created. p  pThats why i need to make some loop recursive that will also check if the directories exist on my server and then to create them if not for example c12345678 The loop should check if c1 exist if not create then create c12 then c123 untill c12345678 and in case the directories c123456 already exist but i typed c12345678 the loop should find that untill 6 the directories exist already so to create only 78 p  pThe exception in in all cases there was exception is the same but im sure this is the problem that i need to make somehow recursive loop that also will check if the childsub directories already exist.p  pWebExceptionp  pThe remote server returned an error 550 File unavailable e.g., file not found, no accessp  precodeSystem.Net.WebException was caught   HResult2146233079   MessageThe remote server returned an error 550 File unavailable e.g., file not found, no access.

Thus, to make things work I have used jQuery 1.9.2, AngularJS 1.2.x and KendoUI with all the shims such as ES5Shim, JSON3. While the application works in IE8, the obvious issue now is performance, as the app heavily uses Kendo Widgets such as DataGrid, Charts etc. Even in Firefox, the rendering is tad slower than Chrome.p  pNow on profiling in Firefox by firebug it seems the call to codeproxycode function takes too much time  dont know how to export profiling data in firefugp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comLwQAr.png altenter image description here p  pHow to improve the performance, specially on KendoUI renderingp
Negative 90304 pIm building an application that will serve up a file as a codeFileStreamcode.  I need to be able to do this without locking the source file, because the file stream may remain in use by the client for some amount of time, and the application may need to perform subsequent write operations on the source file.p  pBasically, Im looking for a way to provide an independent copy of the file as a file stream rather than the source file itself.p  pHere is a POC I started withp  precodeFriend Sub Mainargs As String     Dim fs  GetServerFile     Dim t  SomeOperationThatOverwritesServerFile      just simulate using the file for some period of time,      even thought this probably isnt needed bc its already locked anyway.

For i  1 To 5         Await Task.RunSub File.CopynewSourceFilePath, serverFilePath, True         Await Task.Delay2000     Next End Function codepre  pThis code throws an codeIOExceptioncode on codeAwait Task.RunSub File.CopynewSourceFilePath, serverFilePath, Truecode because the file is locked by the client.

Negative 90304 pIve tried to find a solution at stackoverflow but cant seem to find one quite like mine so here it goes. I have a computer in the lab that is connected to various devices like pantilt units, cameras, and light sensors and has all their drivers installed. I have C code on the lab computer that knows how to talk to the hardware. The C code can set an exposure time, ask for a picture, get one back, and display it in a picture box. I can tell the pantilt to move to a location and have it respond when done. If I am in the lab, it all works just the way I want.p  pThe problem is that I want it to feel like I am at the lab computer when I am really at another computer. Most likely, I will be running the code that is on the non lab computer from inside Visual Studio. The program running in the lab will not be running from Visual Studio. With Remoting, this is a piece of cake. Put the code that talks to the hardware into a class, use MarshalByRefObject along with an interface I create, add RegisterWellKnownServiceType and presto I can use GetObject to get a reference and control it like I was sitting at the computer in the lab. So I know that remoting will work.p  pHowever, remoting is being phased out for WCF not to mention its not real safe out in the real world. It appears to me that WCF is going to make a local copy by value of the remote object which means it will not be on the lab computer and therefore unable to interact with the hardware that is attached. Someday this lab computer and all the sensor equipment is going to be moved away and I will have to access it remotely using the internet. A couple of years ago I did this exact thing but I was using remoting. Since remoting is so insecure, how do I do this without using remoting Does WCF not have something equivalent to MarshalByRefObject If WCF only uses by value, then it seems like they are phasing something out without providing functionality to replace it. Is there a way to use remoting that is not insecure Is there something else besides WCF I should usep  pThis may be long winded but I see lots of people get dinged for asking questions that arent very clear so I am trying to be clear. If there is already a post that truly provides me the best answer to my question, I must first apologize for not finding it myself but ask that a link be provided so I can get the answer there.p

Negative 90304 pIm experimenting with moving an existing enterprise app to HTTP 2.0 at my customers request. The app uses ASP.NET Forms Authentication, and when accessed over HTTPS with HTTP 2.0aware browser and server Windows Server Tech Preview, authentication appears to succeed during the login action, redirecting to the requested URL, but then the server responds to the next request with a redirect back to the login URL again. After adding some diagnostic logging to ApplicationBeginRequest, I found that the auth cookie is present in the request, but an attempt to decrypt the ticket with FormsAuthentication.Decrypt throws an exception stating that there are nonbase64 characters in the cookie. I suspect this has something to do with HTTP 2.0 header compression, but I would have thought that this should have been handled transparently by IIS and that the headers should have been decompressed by the time my code executes. Has anyone else experienced this and know of a workaround Happy to provide additional information if I left anything out.p

Negative 90304 pHey so I am making this project in which the player has to jump platforms all the way to the top. Some monsters spawn randomly throughout the game. So the idea is to lose the game when you hit them from below, but can go on if you jump on them. I already did the part in which the player jumps on it and you destroy the monster but I am still stuck on that part to lose the game when you hit it from below. Any ideas on how I can manage to do this For this project I followed Ray Wenderlichs tutorial on How To Make a Game Like Mega Jump.  So on my GameScene, I have the didBeginContact method p  precodefunc didBeginContactcontact SKPhysicsContact      var updateHUD  false     let whichNode  contact.bodyA.node  player  contact.bodyA.node  contact.bodyB.node     let other  whichNode as GameObjectNode     updateHUD  other.collisionWithPlayerplayer     if updateHUD           lblStars.text  Stringformat X d, GameState.sharedInstance.stars         lblScore.text  Stringformat d, GameState.sharedInstance.score       codepre  pWhich then calls the method from the GameObjectNode Scene. p  precodeclass MonsterNode GameObjectNode    var monsterType MonsterType override func collisionWithPlayerplayer SKNode gt Bool      if player.physicsBody.velocity.dy lt 0          player.physicsBody.velocity  CGVectordx player.physicsBody.velocity.dx, dy 450.0         if monsterType  .Normal              self.removeFromParent               codepre  pWhen the player jumps on top of the monster, the monster is removed from the parent. I was trying to set that if the players velocity is greater than 0 when colliding with the monster, then the player is removed from parent. Then when I go back to my GameScene, I could declare something in my update method so that when the player is removed from the parent call the endGame method. p  precodeoverride func updatecurrentTime NSTimeInterval      if gameOver          return          if Intplayer.position.y gt endLevelY          endGame          if Intplayer.position.y lt maxPlayerY  500          endGame            codepre  pOf course I wasnt able to make that work, and I still cant. So if anyone could help me out on how I can manage to do this, or probably some tutorial which could guide me into doing this I would really appreciate it Thank you in advance. p

Negative 90304 pI have taken over maintenance of a legacy application which manages projects each of which has a separate database identical for the purposes of this question there are currently  1000 databases. In addition, these databases do not have table relationships defined, instead the relationships are determined using joins at the query level. Data is currently extracted using dynamic SQL and ADO.net.p  pI had hoped to use Entity Framework to provide a common data access layer, switching between databases using a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17941225usingentityframeworkonmultipledatabasesdifferent connection stringa as requiredp  pHowever Im now thinking that due to the lack of table relationships it is not even clear which are 1 to many, 1 to 1 etc. EF may be more trouble than its worth, I will have troubles defining associations and navigation properties which will make the task of extracting data much more complex.p  pMy question is, does that sound like a fair assessment Or would Entity Framework be fine in the above scenariop

However, in the database all users are registred and I would like to authenticate against this to not have to maintian my own user database. p  pThe main problem is that there is no uid or gid information in the database and the ldap admins refuse to add this information. p  pMy idea p  pConfigure PAM so that it can authenticate against LDAP. If the user sucessfully authenticates, PAM via pamscript creates a local user in etcpasswd with local unique uid. This local user is later used by nss to find the uid and guid. p  pWhat I have done so far and my questionp  pI can authenticate against ldap and I have an idea on how to create the user at login but I am failing to make NSS use local users for getting uid and gid. How can I split the login so that I only use ldap for authentication and uses local files for finding the uid and guid, shell etc  p

Negative 90304 pI am new to application insights and have set it up using no custom events and Im using all the defaults. The application is build on MVC 5. In the ApplicationInsights.config theres a comment sayingp  pWhen implementing custom user tracking in your application, remove this telemetry initializer to ensure that the number of users is accurately reported to Application Insights.p  pWe have a page where you are required to login so the default user logging isnt saying that much and we would much rather have the username being the unique identifier. Based on the comment it seems like this should be some kind of common modification and therefor easy to modify. When trying to google on custom user tracking I do not find anything interesting which seems a bit odd...p  pSo how do I link the user in Application Insights to my username instead of going on some cookie which seems to be the default behaviourp

Negative 90304 pI have an android application that stores location data. There are three set of Latitude and Longitude in SQLite database.

Second step without changing location and place taking latitude and longitude, it stores to next column with the first data.p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comYRaTL.jpg relnofollowhttpi.stack.imgur.comYRaTL.jpgap  pYou can see in the abouve image url there are 3 sets of latitude and longitude. After getting the first latitude and longitude I want to add second latitude and longitude to the column latitudey and longitudey, then next values to the latitudez and longitudez.

Negative 90304 pI am making a blackjack game as a means to practice.  I used an array at first, but decided to try to make a version using a stack since I could use the practice with stacks.  p  pI created a playing card class.  p  precodeclass PlayingCard     private     int value    char suit     public    PlayingCard     PlayingCardint val, char type            value  val        suit  type         int getValue            return value         char getSuit           return suit         void setValueint val           value  val         void setSuitchar type           suit  type      codepre  pI then created a stack of that class.  p  precodestackltPlayingCardgt deck1 codepre  pNow for example I push the following onto the stack  p  precodedeck1.pushPlayingCardC, 9 codepre  pFirst, am I correct in my understanding that that pushes a PlayingCard object onto the stack with the suit of C clubs and a value of 9p  pThe issue I am having is now printing out the suit and value values when the player draws a card from the stack.  p  pI cant just do cout ltlt deck1.top because its a stack of class objects and the suit and value values are private variables of the playingCard which are retrieved with the get functions.  p  pI tried making this function to print out the values insteadp  precodevoid printsPlayingCard tester      cout ltlt tester.getSuit ltlt   ltlt tester.getValue ltlt n   codepre  pThe call looks like thisp  precodeprintsdeck1.top codepre  pHowever that does not give me the correct output.  Any advice  If I should just use a vector or an array then I guess I can do that but I thought it would be better to use a stack since a stack better mimics how an actual deck of cards would work with popping and drawing a card off the top of a deck.    p

Because the bundle signal is made up of the flattened signals, and from the implementation of the stronganystrong, it also flattens the signal. So that SA, SB, SC, SD, SE, SF are all flattened and when SA returns, the stronganystrong signal returns. This is not what I want. I want that SASBSC, the final SC returns, the bundleOne returnsp  pCould any one help me or Reactive Cocoa doesnt fit for this I have to resort to the nested block again....p  pThanks a lot.p

How can I store the value for codeExtraFieldcode as hidden in this scenariop  pstrongEditstrong There is a dropdownlist on the view.

It all works fine except the ExtraField. Now as you can see that based on some condition I am rendering ExtraField when HasAccount2 is set to true so that User can select true or false by himself but incase OptionID is 3 then I dont want the ExtraField checkbox to be rendered rather I want to set it explicitly from controller and store it in HiddenField so that when user submit the form for save then the ExtraField value is also passed.p

Negative 90304 pCurrently i have to make a form that can add fields and remove them if you dont want them. For example the code below now displays 3 fields to fill in, as you can see the first field does not have a remove button however the other 2 does. there is also an add button which duplicates a field. Currently the duplicate, is duplicating id2 which kind of works but once i remove id2 i cant duplicate it. So my question is that, is it possible to duplicate id1 at the same time have a button appear beside the duplicated field that removes it. I am restricted to only HTML, Css, and Javascript.

I then store this on a pen drive and hand to someone where they will be able to browse the page and view the embedded pdf files.p  pSo  the problem Im having is that every solution Ive seen to view pdfs online either using adobes plugin or 3rd party pdf viewers, require a server to be serving the pdf file in order to render.

Negative 90304 pIf each node maps to a set of the nodes it has edges to, instead of a list, we would gain the ability to gain constant time lookup of edges, instead of having to traverse the whole list. The only disadvantage I can think of is slightly more memory overhead and time to enumerate the edges of a node, but not asymptotically significantly so. p
Negative 90304 pI am currently developing an EclipseRCP application that stores perproject preferences using the strongEclipsePreferencestrong mechanism through strongProjectScopestrong. At first this seemed to work very well, but we have run into trouble when read accessing these preferences in multithreaded scenarios while at the same time changes are being made to the workspace. What appears to be praticularly problematic is accessing such a preference node codeProjectScope.getNodecode while the project is being deleted by an asynchronous user action right click on Project  Delete Project. In such cases we get a pretty mix of p  ul licodeorg.osgi.service.prefs.BackingStoreExceptioncodeli licodejava.io.FileNotFoundExceptioncodeli licodeorg.eclipse.core.runtime.CoreExceptioncodeli ul  pEssentially they all complain that the underlying file is no longer there.p  pInitial attempts to emfixem this using checks like codeIProject.existscode or codeisAccessiblecode and even going so far as checking the presence of the actual .prefs file were as futile as expected They only make the exceptions less likely but do not really prevent them.p  pSo my question is How are you supposed to safely access things like codeProjectScope.getNodecode Do you need to go so far to put every read into a codeWorkspaceJobcode or is there some other, clever way to prevent the above problems like putting the read access in codeDisplay.asyncExeccodep  pAlthough I tried, I did not really find answers to the above question in the Eclipse documentation.p
