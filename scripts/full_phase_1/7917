Negative 7917 pThe Matrix in SSRS SQL Server Reporting Services 2005 seems to have issues with certain the border styles when exporting to XLS but not PDF or web view maybe other formats, not sure.p  pFor example Create a matrix and set the Matrix border style to Black Solid 1px, but all 4 of the cells to have a border style of Black None 1px. When viewed via the ASP.NET control, it looks correct. But after export to XLS, it creates borders around all of the header cells column and row headers, and the top left cell, and even the right most data column. But all the cells in the middle of the report correctly have no border set.p  pUpdatep  pIf the Matrix borders are set to None, then the borders on the cells dont show up in XLS. So, how do you set an outer border around the Matrix, but not have it apply the all sides border to every cell that touches the edge of the Matrix when exported to Excelp

Negative 7917 pRight... this one had me baffled for a while today so maybe one of you SQL Server bright sparks can shed some light on this behaviour.p  pWe have a table codePhonescode.

However, my question is more about the appropriateness of switch statements in code and whether we should always try to replace them whenever they are found so in this case Im inclined to accept the answer that this switch statement is appropriate.p

Negative 7917 pIve created a png file with Autocads rendering tool and published it on a website. The problem is that it does not show in safari on mac. It displays correctly on Firefox installed on the same machine and on windows. I tried to figure that out and when I was inspecting the img element I found a message in the safari console saying something like  Element interpreted as a document, but send with a imagepng MIME type. Ive translated that from polish so the original english message can be a little bit different.  The problem occurs in Safari 4.0.1 on OS X 10.5.7.  Here is the link to the image causing problems  a hrefhttpbudujemyzop.files.wordpress.com200907biuro.png relnofollowhttpbudujemyzop.files.wordpress.com200907biuro.pnga  By the way the image when saved on the desktop displays correctly as a desktop icon and when previewed in finders preview tool.

Negative 7917 pIve read everything I could find on this topic, including a couple of very helpful discussions on this site, the NASA coding guidelines and Google C guidelines.  I even bought the physical C design book recommended on here sorry, forgot the name and got some useful ideas from that.  Most sources seem to agree  header files should be selfcontained, i.e. they include what they need so that a cpp file could include the header without including any others and it would compile.  I also get the point about forward declaring rather than including whenever possible.p  pThat said, how about if codefoo.cppcode includes codebar.hcode and codequx.hcode, but it turns out that codebar.hcode itself includes codequx.hcode  Should codefoo.cppcode then avoid including codequx.hcode  Pro cleans up codefoo.cppcode less noise.  Con if someone changes bar.h to no longer include codequx.hcode, codefoo.cppcode mysteriously starts failing to compile.  Also causes the dependency between codefoo.cppcode and codequx.hcode not to be obvious.p  pIf your answer is a cpp file should include every header it needs, taken to its logical conclusion that would mean that pretty much every cpp file has to codeinclude ltstringgt, ltcstddefgtcode etc. since most code will end up using those, and if youre not supposed to rely on some other header including them, your cpp needs to include them explicitly.  That seems like a lot of noise in the cpp files.p  pThoughtsp  pPrevious discussionsp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions188449whataresometechniquesforlimitingcompilationdependenciesincprojectshttpstackoverflow.comquestions188449whataresometechniquesforlimitingcompilationdependenciesincprojectsap  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions181921yourpreferredccheaderpolicyforbigprojectshttpstackoverflow.comquestions181921yourpreferredccheaderpolicyforbigprojectsap  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions51561howdoiautomatefindingunusedincludedirectiveshttpstackoverflow.comquestions51561howdoiautomatefindingunusedincludedirectivesap  pETA Inspired by previous discussions on here, Ive written a Perl script to successively comment out each include and using, then attempt to recompile the source file, to figure out whats not needed.  Ive also figured out how to integrate it with VS 2005, so you can doubleclick to go to unused includes.  If anyone wants it let me know...very much experimental right now though.p
Negative 7917 pI have built a custom binding for being able to receive HTTP messages from an additional source.

Negative 7917 pI am doing a project where I have too develop an application that listens for incoming events by a service. The device that has to listen too events is an Android phone with Android SDK 1.5 on it. Currently the services that call events only implement communication trough UDP or TCP sockets. I can solve my problem by setting up a ServerSocket, but i doubt thats the most power efficient way. This application will be running most of the time, with WiFi on, and Id like too reach an long battery duration. Ive been looking for options on the internet for my question for a while but i couldnt get a real answer. Ive got the following questionsp  ul liWhat is the most efficient way too listen to incoming events Should I make an ServerSocket or what are my optionsli liAre there any other implementations that are more power efficientli ul  pIve been also thinking of implementing communication trough XMPP.

Negative 7917 pI have found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1868009speedupmatrixadditionincsome mentions in another question of matrix addition being a quadratic operationa. But I think it is linear.p  pIf I double the size of a matrix, I need to calculate double the additions, not quadruple.p  pThe main diverging point seems to be what is the size of the problem. To me, its the number of elements in the matrix. Others think it is the number of columns or lines, hence the codeOn2code complexity.p  pAnother problem I have with seeing it as a quadratic operation is that that means adding 3dimensional matrices is cubic, and adding 4dimensional matrices is codeOn4code, etc, even though all of these problems can be reduced to the problem of adding two vectors, which has an obviously linear solution.p  pAm I right or wrong If wrong, whyp

Still doesnt work.p

Negative 7917 pI have a list of services which can be identified by names. Every service has a set of parameters IP address, port, availability and so on. There are also method which can be applied to the services close connection, open connection, send a message to the server, check if it is responding and so on.p  pSo, I thought it is a natural approach to create a Server class and represent real servers as objects of this class.p  pBut than I realized that it is not really convenient. For example I have a name of the server just a string and I would like to do something with this server. Then I need to have a map which maps name of the server to the object representing this server It does not seems to be an elegant solution.p  pWhat I decided is to have a class containing a set of static methods. And then, for example to use it in the following way codeServerClass.sendMessageNameOfServer,MyMessagecode or for example codeServerClass.closeNameOfServercode or codeServerClass.getIPNameOfServercode.p  pIs it a good solutionp

It goes something like thisp  precodeclass ElectionMethod     class IterativeMethod         class SNTV         ...     class NonIterativeMethod         class OrderDependent             class CambridgeSTV             ...         class OrderIndependent             class WIGM                 class ERS97STV                 ...             class Recursive                 class MeekSTV                 ... codepre  pOnly the leaves of the class hierarchy are ever instantiated into objects.  This does serve its purpose of maximizing code reuse, but the code itself is complicated some classes have 20 or so methods and given the many levels it can be time consuming to find where something is implemented.p  pIve tried pulling out chunks of functionality and putting that functionality in a separate object, but I havent found a good way to do this since nearly all the functionality depends on common data.  I.e., I can move some code to a different object but it needs to refer back to the big complex hierarchy to get the data it needs so it isnt really encapsulation.p  pDoes anyone have any advice as to how to make this more manageablep

Negative 7917 pIve got some pages such as the useragreement that I want to appear with or without the layout codeextendscode tag depending on how it is called. Im using codejQuery Fancyboxcode to load up these pages in iframes. If JS is disabled, the links should open in a new window w the full layout, otherwise, if theyre in an iframe, they dont need the layout.p  pAs of now, Im doing using jQuery to strip out the headerfooter replacing the body with just the content portionp  precodeifwindow.location  window.parent.location      body.htmlcontent  codepre  pBut it doesnt seem right to load stuff that will never be displayed or worse, will be displayed for a half second until the JS kicks in. I guess what I could do is create a partial template containing only the content, and then two container pages, one with the headerfooter and one without they both include the partial. Then use JS to modify the link... which would have to point to different views, which would in turn call the different templates... seems like an awful lot of work. Theres gotta be a better wayp  hr  pZeissSp  pSomething like this is emnotem possible in Djangop  precode if not iframe       extends layoutsdefault.html   endif  codepre  pThe code extends code tag emmustem be the first tag in the template, thus it cannot be conditionally commented out. I guess maybe I could do it in the layout itself...and then itd apply to all my pages.... lets try that.p

Negative 7917 pIn an ASP.NET web app written in VB.NET, I need to load and store a large readonly hash table that is frequently accessed by the application. It only needs to be loaded once on application start, is never updated and can be accessed by any session at any time. p  pIf I load the hash table into a private member in a global module, a lookup to it takes one 20th of the time compared to storing the hash table in the Application or Cache object.

Negative 7917 pI am developing a Windows Forms application that uses a codeDataGridViewcode for a user to enter some data. The user enters the data into a  codeDataGridViewTextBoxCellcode. This works fine, however if the user wants to go back and edit that data, the existing text there automatically gets selected and overwritten when the user starts editing. p  pI would like the codeDataGridViewTextBoxCellcode to behave more like a regular codeTextBoxcode control. I want the user to simply be able to insert the carat anywhere in a codeDataGridViewTextBoxCellcode they have already entered text into, and then start editing without any existing text being overwritten. p  pAny suggestions p

Negative 7917 pI have a base class codeMyBasecode with lots of possible derived classes in this example, codeMyDerivedcode and codeMyDerived2code.  Along the way a codeListltMyBasegtcode is handed off to another class, and then later on that class needs to call a constructor of yet another class... which constructor is called is based entirely on whats in the codeListcode. p  pI can use Reflection to find the constructor, but only if somewhere along the way I do something likep  precodevar r  baseList.ConvertAllx gt MyDerived1x   codepre  pSo that codercode contains a codeListltMyDerived1gtcode and I can find the constructor through Reflection.  This is silly, of course, because I could also just bakein the constructor since Im bothering to bake in codeMyDerived1code in that codeConvertAllcode statement.  But this is one derived class, and I have dozens.p  pWhat I want to do is have the method codeRunTestcode call the right constructor based entirely on what it finds in the codeListltMyBasegtcode at runtime.

Negative 7917 pIm having trouble with a fairly simple three column layout where there is a container div which contains several other divs, some of which are basically present for design, the main one of which contains a table. So the relevant source looks a bit like thisp  precodeltdiv idwrappergt   ltdiv idleftsidedecorationgtampnbspltdivgt   ltdiv idrightsidedecorationgtampnbspltdivgt   ltdiv idcontentgt     lttable iddatatablegt       lttheadgtltthgtTitleltthgtlttheadgt       lttrgtlttdgtContent Row 1lttdgtlttrgt       lttrgtlttdgtContent Row 2lttdgtlttrgt       lttrgtlttdgtContent Row 3lttdgtlttrgt     lttablegt   ltdivgt   ltdiv idfooterdecorationgt ltdivgt codepre  pFor the design to work I need the overall height to be at least the height of the browser window. So I have a stylesheet that works like thisp  precodewrapper         height 100     leftsidedecoration          float left       height 100       width 154px       backgroundcolor red    rightsidedecoration          float right       width 1em       height 100       backgroundcolor red    content        height 100     border 1px solid 6f9dd9     marginleft 154px     marginright 1em    footerdecoration        height 3em     clear both     backgroundcolor green    codepre  pNow this works out fine in Firefox and often in IE, but codedatatablecode can get taller than the height of the browser window. When that happens, it vanishes under the codefooterdecorationcode div and reappears below it for Internet Explorer users. p  pI have tried changing the overflow settings, but I dont want to lose the content at the bottom of the page or have a scrollbar, what I really want is for the page to be emat leastem the height of the browser window but maybe a little taller. The obvious thing for this would be to use codeminheightcode but when I change the height of the wrapper to use that both codeleftsidedecorationcode and coderightsidedecorationcode shrink down to a few pixels high and neither using a 100 height or a 100 minheight seems to change it.p  pSo if I use codeheight 100code my table falls out of the bottom of the page in IE, if I use codeminheight 100code my side panels shrink away to nothing. I assume that the minheight problem relates to the divs floating and so being out of the page flow, but I dont see a good way to fix it. Any solutionsp

Negative 7917 pProbably a very poorly named title, but anyway...p  pI am using the command pattern on a hierarchical data set. So basically I need a method that returns an object that emdescribesem the changes that will be made without actually changing the data. So for examplep  pObject 1  Object 2  Object 3p  pIf I move object 1, it will cause a change in Object 2, which will cause a change in Object 3 because they depend on each other. So...I need a method to recursively go through the hierarchical collection and gather up the changes that are required to move Object 1 without actually modifying the collection. Halfway through the recursion it would be nice to be able to use something like Object1.Location, but it may already slated for change so I cant reliably use it.p  pI feel like there are plenty of algorithms and such that need to do this type of in place modification. As a nonCS major I didnt learn much of this type of thing, so I dont really even know what search terms to look for to find a solution. I put solution in quotes because I realize there probably isnt a direct solution for my problem, but I am merely looking for some good guidelinesexamples of this being done to get my brain cranking.p  pCan anyone provide some realworld examples of this type of thing being done Thanks in advance.p

Negative 7917 pI have a Rails app with 600 models and that will soon grow to 8001000. Id like to segment the rails app so that only certain models get loaded and therefore act as a separate app, but all share the same base models. Is there a standard practice for doing thisp  pEDIT I am on 2.3.8p  pEDIT 2p  pThe problem is that many models are similar, but different just enough that it warrants writing a new class, i.e. the logic required to put it all in one model would be horrendous. Some of the models could be moved out into rake tasks or the lib directory, but only about 30 or so. Some are abstract classes that act as parents of one arm of the model tree. However, most relate to database tables. I am thinking about at deploy time segmenting parts of the app into plugins via Engines so that one app can only handle one set of models they are independent but so that I can keep them all together in development and in one git repo for convenience. Im going to go down this route unless someone else has a better idea, and Ill post back to let you know how it goes. p

Negative 7917 pI am working with several ActionScript 3 files inside of Flash Professional CS5, which all throw an error each time the application is complied. The compiler gives me this error for each file code1093 Syntax errorcode. I notice the lines it directs my attention to are all before and after package declarations, and each of these regions contain either a comment or some white space. I have been able to remedy this problem by removing the comments and white spacing that appear before and after each package declaration.p  pI was wondering, is it really emthatem big of a deal to have white space and comments before and after package declarations I always thought comments and white spacing were ignored by the compiler. I have had comments before package declarations with no problem, never tried the white spacing, though. Can anyone direct me as to how I could solve this problem, or do I just need to remove all of the extra fluffp

Negative 7917 pIm trying to wrap my head around how to handle this scenario with WPF by leveraging its binding capabilities. I have a model that I dont control, its an external system that, given some inputs lots, actually produces an output lots here too. The output of this system is what I need to display on the UI, but Im wondering how I should leverage WFP bindings to carry out incremental updates, since I dont control the model and cant know what has changed in the output since last call to the external system actually, very little might have changed, so it really doesnt make sense to rebind the while model. p  pI would like to be able to perform incremental updates to the UI instead of rebinding the entire data, which kills the smoothness of the UI and represents a usability problem. Is there a common way of handling this or should I just reflect over the output and produce change notifications artificiallyp

Negative 7917 pSince I am new to iOS development I have a few Questions. Firstly I did read some of the other related questions I just want to clarify a few things.p  pAs I understand itp  ol lipI can make an app for a client and then the client can purchase the app for me and register a Enterprise account and then be able to distribute the app in house. But they need to have 500 employees to be able to subscribe for Enterprise.pli lipI can make an app and distribute it to end users in the normal manner. Nothing funky about this.pli ol  pNow my questions are, what way should one go about when you want to create an in house app for a client with less than 500 employees, which means they cant register for a enterprise account And is it posible to list an app for free on app store but you can only use it if you have a license code that you need to enter to unlock the app, so basically when Jon Doe downloads the app he cant use it, but if the client downloads the app they enter the code and the app then gets unlockedp  pEdit Not Applicable Anymore, See Edit 2 Ok did some more research, another problem I        will be facing in the new future is that South African companies cant get a DUNS number which is required for the enterprise license, so basically that route is blocked for me, because of that problem. So what other way is there to go about thisp  pEdit 2 After some further research I found that the DUNS number can be obtained outside the US and that South Africa is listed as a country in which a DUNS number can be obtained. Can anyone out side the US and mostly outside Europe confirm that DUNS numbers are available in their countries, and actually know of companies in there country that has one. And I know I am going of topic but how can I check if a company has a DUNS number.p  pThanksp

Negative 7917 pIm having some trouble with a fluid layout with images using maxwidth100 in Internet Explorer 8. The problem comes when I want to wrap an anchor tag around a flexiblewidth image and margins, padding, and borders get involved. This is a little harder than youd think.p  pSo the HTML is roughly thisp  precodeltdivgt     lta classimagewrap hrefgt         ltimg altsomething srcpathtoimage.jpggt     ltagt ltdivgt codepre  pAnd the stylingp  precodeimg       maxwidth 100     display block       .imagewrap      padding 5px     border 1px solid black     display block  codepre  pSo what I have is a fluid image, surrounded by an anchor with a padding and border.p  pThe above is good unless emthe image is smaller than the containerem. In that case, the anchors padding and border expand beyond the image filling the full width of the container.p  pSo lets try something to force the anchor to fit its contentp  precode.imagewrap      padding 5px     border 1px solid black     display inlineblock  codepre  pOK, now the anchor box doesnt grow larger than the image, but the anchor tag is back to being not flexible in Firefox, Opera, and IE8. But it does trigger layout in IE7 so thats taken care of. Next upp  precode.imagewrap      padding 5px     border 1px solid black     display inlineblock     maxwidth 100  codepre  pNow the anchor is flexible again, but its 12px emlargerem than the container when the image starts scaling down. The anchor is calculating the width based on the image, then adding the border and padding. For some reason, Chrome and Safari dont do this. Anyway, alternate box model to the rescue p  precode.imagewrap      padding 5px     border 1px solid black     display inlineblock     maxwidth 100     mozboxsizing borderbox     boxsizing borderbox  codepre  pNow its working as expected in Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera, IE7, IE9, but not IE8 for some reason. There, the anchor still extends outside the container. Im a little stumped as to what to do, as codeboxsizing borderboxcode is supposed to be supported in IE8.p  pIve got a JSFiddle page that isolates the issue a hrefhttpjsfiddle.net3gkXU22 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.net3gkXU22ap  pAs a last resort I could use JavaScript to detect if the anchor is bigger than its parent element, and then switch it to codedisplay blockcode on the assumption that people are unlikely to resize their browser. Im not against that, but is there a CSS solution herep

Negative 7917 pIve been knocking my head against a wall here for a few hours trying to solve this with no luck. Im using Ruby, Haml, Sinatra, and Highcharts. Ive created a Ruby HighCharts object that interpolates a Haml partial containing only the javascript filter followed by the necessary HighChart JS.p  pThis works fine when I test it in the base route . The JQuery, Highcharts, and inline JS from the partial loads just fine and the chart is rendered successfully.p  pBut when I put the IDENTICAL code in another route e.g. userid and appropriate view, the chart is not rendered. Using Firebug, I can see that Jquery, Highcharts, and appropriate JS from the partial load correctly and the Ruby variables are interpolated exactly as they are when I put this code in the base route. So the JS fed to the browser is identical, but the chart is only rendered when I put this in the base route.p  pOne thing that might help diagnosis on the userid page, when I inspect the external Jquery and Highchart scripts with Firebug in Chrome, it says Access to restricted URI denied. But when I inspect those scripts on the the base page , it shows the full javascript text. On both pages when I inspect the Ruby interpolated inline Highcharts JS, it shows the full text.p  pMaybe the Jquery and Highcharts external scripts arent loading correctly on the userid page Any idea what the problem might bep  pHeres my layout haml file, in case its helpful for diagnosing the problemp  precode   html     head       title title     linkrelstylesheet hrefstyle.sass     scriptsrc gt javascriptsjquery1.6.2.js     scriptsrc gt javascriptsjshighcharts.js   body     framecontent       .innertube         nav             ul             li               ahref Home             li               ahrefsenate Users  maincontent   .innertube      if flash[notice]       p.notice          flash[notice]      if flash[error]       p.error          flash[error]     yield codepre

Negative 7917 pWhat is the best practice for radio buttons that should be associated with several input fieldsp  pThe two solutions Ive seen are to use JavaScript to make sure only the intended information is submitted or implement conditional logic on the server side that ignores or uses the input values that are submitted every time.p  pPersonally I like this logic on the client side, but if your implementation requires nonJavaScript, this is impossible isnt it.p  pAlso, solving this problem server side instead of client side seems more robust against running into an error due to an incorrect value being submitted.  I just dont like it because its additional logic that server side shouldnt have to worry about...p  pOr is there a overall better solution to the problem at hand besides using radio buttons associated with several input fieldsp

Negative 7917 pI have a PHP project where I am opening up a premade PDF, and filling it out with data via PHP.  The problem I am having is that one of the text elements isnt showing up.

Negative 7917 pI have 2 localized directories ca.lproj and es.lproj. Both own a nib MyNib.xib and an icon MyIcon.png. MyIcon.png is used in a custom button in the nib.

I need each nib to embbed the correct icon.p  pThe problem is that if I open the nib in one lproj  say the es.lproj  and try to assign the icon to the button in IB, I can only see the icon that belong to the OTHER lproj  the ca.lproj .

Negative 7917 pI have some data being pulled in from an Entity model. This contains attributes of items, lets  say car parts with maxspeed, weight and size. Since there are a lot of parts and the base attributes never change, Ive cached all the records.p  pDepending on the car these parts are used in, these attributes might now be changed, so I setup a new car, copy the values from the cached item Engine to the new car object and then add TurboCharger, which boosts max speed, weight and size of the Engine. p  pThe problem Im running into is that it seems that the Entity model is still tracking the context embackem to the cached data. So when weight is increased by the local method, it increases it for all users. I tried adding strongMergeOption.NoTrackingstrong to my context as this is supposed to remove all entity tracking, but it still seems to be tracking back. If I turn off the cache, it works fine as it pulls fresh values from the database each time.p  pIf I want to copy a record from my entity model, is there a way I can say Copy the object but treat it as a standard object with no history of coming from entity so that once my car has the attributes from an item, it is just a flattened objectp  pCheersp

Negative 7917 pIm fairly new to Android development and I cant seem to grasp the Java Out of Memory exception. I know it means that my app has gone over the VM budget but after Googling this many times I still dont seem to grasp this concept. Im afraid that my app uses too much memory because I have six button selectors per screen with two bitmaps for each selector which are around 20 kb each according to the properties tab. On my rooted G2x I have set the VM budget to 12mb,restarted my phone and ran my app with no problems whatsoever. I am unbinding  drawables on each onDestroy and hinting at the GC to run here also. After using the app for a while in the emulator I click Cause GC on my DDMS screen and the results are  ID1, Heap Size 6.133 MB, Allocated 2.895MB, Free 3.238 MB,  Used 47.20,  Objects 52,623. p  pThis is where I dont understand whats happening, my emulator is set to 24MB of VM. Where is that number The actual problem Im having is that if i set the emulator to 16MB of VM my app crashes on the second activity with the Out of Memory exception. How come it doesnt crash on my phone with the VM set to 12 MB or on my old HTC Magic phone with 12 MB of VM stock Also do you guys think my app is taking up too much memory I have no idea if those DDMS numbers are good or not. Thanks for your time. p  pAs for my code I have every image specified in XML layouts I do not do anything programmaticly with them except for adding listeners to them. I found this bit of code on here and Ive added it to every activity that I have...p  precode    Override     protected void onDestroy                  super.onDestroy              unbindDrawablesfindViewByIdR.id.myRootLayout             System.gc            private void unbindDrawablesView view                  if view.getBackground  null                                  view.getBackground.setCallbacknull                          if view instanceof ViewGroup ampamp view instanceof AdapterView                                  for int i  0 i lt ViewGroup view.getChildCount i                                                  unbindDrawablesViewGroup view.getChildAti                                          ViewGroup view.removeAllViews                   codepre  pp  pOtherwise all I do is add onClickListeners to the buttons that have the PNG backgrounds. I would like to learn how to specify button backgrounds programmaticly but I need to have the selector functions like on focus, on press, nonfocused but pressed etc. to make the button backgrounds change according to user interaction. I have reviewed the docs about this but it seems overwhelming, thats why I figured Id start here with the basics of managing Heaps and work my way up to specifying selectors in code. This may not make sense but is there a healthy amount of memory allocation that an app could allocate without getting close to the Out of Memory exception For example if an app allocated 6MB it should be fine but 8MB would be pushing it, are there bounds like that in memory allocation Thanks again Alex Lockwood for your response Im going to read and reread it again until this stuff makes sense to mep
Negative 7917 pI use Matlabs plot function to create a comparison of two matrices each 1300x1 double. The values are plotted in hundreds, because every hundred needs its own color and marker type.

Negative 7917 pI couldnt find a solution for this in other posts, so here is my problem. In advance, I use JSF 2 with Mojarra implementation and Primefaces 3.2 on a JBoss 7.1 ASp  pI am building a searchmask that should be generated dynamically during runtime. I know from another post that I should use a dataTable for that. That is what I will do.p  pBut the searchmask consists of 3 parts, the searchcriterion e.g. name, birthday,..., the operator is, is not, larger than, in range,... and the operand what the user will give as searchinput.p  pMy goal is to get the searchmask get generated dynamically, BUT the type of input field is dependent on what criterionoperator has been choosen by the user.p  pSo if the user chose criterion name and operator is not from the dropdown boxes, then the input field for the operand should be just a simple pinputText.p  pBut if the user chose criterion birthday and operator before, then the input field should be a datepicker like pcalendar.p  pMy idea was to use a pdataTable for a List of SearchRow objects where every object has an array of criteria and operands to use them in a hselectOneMenu.p  pThen I add a valueChangeListener to the selectMenues and in there I calculate and create the right type of UIComponent I need as inputfield.p  pBut I have no idea how to add that UICOmponent as the 3rd column inside the dataTable.p  pSo is my idea any good and is there a way at all to solve my problemp  pThanks in advancep

Also, if to track things you have to use some other framework thing that would be helpful to know too p  pTHANKYOU FOR ANY HELPp

Negative 7917 pI am designing the core of my program and have various entities which I currently loop through to call codeupdatecode. I have around ten codevectorcodes containing my objects, although this might grow to a much larger amount in future. I have just realized I will need to look these up via an codeidcode fairly regularly, so I am forced to loop through all elements to look for the correct id. p  pI am thinking of creating a codehashmapcode that contains the codeidcode along with a pointer to the object itself. Is this the most efficient way to do this The ids are semi random although they only increase throughout program, with each element in each of the lists having an unique id each time one is assigned the id counter goes up. The elements in vectors now get removed and added often. I havent worked much with hashmaps, other than a small bit in java, so I am unsure if this will be an efficient route to go. I believe the code will still be readable, but are there any options other than hashmap that would be better suited for this Thanksp

Negative 7917 pI am new to web designing, I have searched for an answer and tried almost everything I could find but couldnt get what I want.

My layout is something like thisp  precodelthtmlgt ltbodygt   ltdiv idcontentgt      lttablegt        more divs... more content...      lttablegt       lttablegt         more divs... more content...      lttablegt      ....   ltdivgt   ltfootergt      lttablegt       ....      lttablegt   ltfootergt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pAnd please notice my content is dynamic, it can be long or short based on user input. In browser I dont have any problems, the footer is at the bottom of the content. But in print outs I want this footer to be at the bottom of the last page and I want this to work mainly only in IE browsers. IE 7, 8 and 9. So if the content is long, and it goes to 3 print out pages, the footer should appear only on the bottom of the last page. Please tell me how I can get this done Most online solutions like sticky footer just dont work in the print out when the content is long...They stick to the bottom of the content in the print out as you can see in print previews. I will really appreciate any help. Simple css solutions are better, but if nothing else works out I am ready to try js, PHP as well even though I am a beginner. p

It is not present neither among predefined colors nor I can select it from the custom colors popup dialog. Is it a bug Maybe I am doing something wrong.

I failed to dispose context object by just set the reference null.With the help of FB profile tool, I find that context object appears to be a GC Root.

And the profile tool show me this instance is a GCRoot. I read some articles about GC, but few of them mention GCRoot itself. Could anybody tell me why and thank you so muchp  pPS I tried to call System.gc twice after makeAndDrop but it didnt work. In fact, Im more interested in the is GCRoot issueimplied by the fb profile, it may help more if you tell me about it.p

Negative 7917 pEdit It seems this was a stupid mistake by me, i got a rotationChanged notification too early, before i could process it. That caused a chain reaction which caused a crash in some obscure location. Let me see how i can closedelete this question...p  pMy apps been working fine for a while, but i decided today to finally implement it correctly, that is Use a view controller instead of manually adding a single view to the UIWindow. This went quite smooth for a while, untill i tried setting window.rootViewController to my view controller.p  pSomewhere after applicationDidFinishLaunchingWithOptions, it crashes with a bad access. Theres no useful stacktrace it crashes in the assembly, and i cant see it getting back into my code anywhere i placed logs all over the place. Just adding the viewcontrollers view to the main window works fine. This is the part of the codep  precodeBOOL applicationUIApplication app didFinishLaunchingWithOptionsNSDictionary launchOptions      ....     self.window  [[UIWindow alloc] initWithFrame [UIScreen mainScreen].bounds]     self.viewController  [[MainViewController alloc]init]      if i uncomment this it crashes      self.window.rootViewController  self.viewController     [self.window addSubview viewController.view]  Commented out if i use the rootViewController      [self.window makeKeyAndVisible]     NSLogDid finish launching     return YES  codepre  pIve tried quite some debugging methods stacktrace does not exist, stepping through the code manually takes forever, logs are not being called before the crash, but i cant find the problem. It crashes in codelibobjc.A.dylibobjcretaincode, and the only other thing in the stacktrace is codeobjcstoreStrongcode. Its not a retainrelease problem at least not directly, since im using ARC. The final NSLog is called and it gets out of the didFinishLaunching if i step through manually.p  pI can get the app working without setting the root view controller, but the whole point of redoing this part was to do everything proper e.g. rotation has to be done relatively hackish without the root view controller.p  pso StackOverflow, please tell me you have some ideas As this is driving me crazy Sp

Negative 7917 pIm working on an iphone project with storyboards in Xcode, and I have a tableview that lists cells loaded from an array it owns. Through push segues I load 2 other views for adding an item to the table, and then I use a unwind segue to go back to the table. p  pIn the segue method for the tableview, I use reloadData to load the added cell. But when I do so, the table scroll boundaries are off, as if no cell was added. Though when I go back one step in the pushhierarchy and back in again to the tableView, the boundaries are working fine. So, I guess I have to do some more updating in the segue method other than just calling reloadData p  pby boundries are off I mean that the tableview scrolling starts to bounce at the same scroll position as it did before any added cells.

Negative 7917 pI am trying to display in codeDataGridViewcode control names and fields of database tables. In every row name of a table is displayed in the first cell, and second column allows to choose any of the fields of that table.p  pTo do that, I am handling DataGridView.CellBeginEdit event and fill DataSource for cell with names of the fields.

Negative 7917 pIs there a way I can get a context menu pop up when a user long presses on the blank space of a listview I know that this can be done by setting wrapcontent to the layoutheight parameter of the listview. In fact I have been doing that successfully for a while. However, sometimes this wrapcontent behaves very strangely and though there is enough space on the screen the listview restricts itself to a  of the screen and items scroll within that space. To avoid that problem I have moved to the path of setting the height as 0dp and weight as 1. However, that has disturbed the functionality I had in terms of long pressing the empty area of a list to add a new item to the list.

Negative 7917 pI have a project where I have a 2D image but I need to then turn this into a 3D object.  I already have the skeleton model of the object, it is a simple matter of applying color to the surface.  I have been looking around and it seems 3D programs like Blender have a method like this called texture mapping or uv mapping.  However I was assigned to use Mayavi and Python, and so far I could not really find anything about texture mapping in the Mayavi documentation.  I was wondering if someone knows how if possible to perform texture mapping in Mayavi.  p  pAlternatively, if texture mapping is not possible, what would be the best way if there is a way to turn a 2D image into a 3D object.p

Negative 7917 pGmailContacts does a great job of parsing this address into specific address fields. p  p7 Prasad Road, Narimedu, Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India p  pis accurately parsed to be  Street 7 Prasad Road Neighborhood Narimedu City Madurai StateProvince Tamil Nadu, Country Indiap  pIs there anyway to use Google Maps Contacts API just to transform free text into address fields like thisp  pOne more thing to note This is for a nonprofit. Not a commercial site. p  pIm concerned about using Geocoding to approximate because we are working globally and Google Maps is not too accurate in finding the right location in some countries. I still dont want to lose information user has entered. Usually we need to be able to filter addresses by city and state so these need to parsed exactly. The rest of it should not be lost. With geocoding, Im finding that it formats the address to remove the fields that it doesnt understand. In gmail contacts, it leaves that alone and parses what it is able to parse. p  pThanks, Safrisp  pUPDATE  Google maps api is able to pick up the neighborhood, city, state, country from what the user has typed.

Negative 7917 pI have been attempting to write a simple RESTful api in php. Part of my goal in doing this is to get a good grasp on how to approach php OOP projects. In javascript, I have no issue with encapsulation, inheritance, etc. I generally start out with a single object maybe even just as a namespace that I will nest everything in, i.e.codevar appName  code. A simpler object may just be a group of methods...then are a few typical needs like an codeinitcode function to set things up andor codeexecuteruncode function in which I can detail a flow. I like to use a few general functions there that summarize everything that will happen, then detail them, then detail those, etc, so it is always easy to see how the result is produced, and you can investigate the details further as needed. I also keep everything independent so that each function doesnt have to worry about how it gets its dependencies, etc.  So, I hope that gives you an idea of where Im coming from.. I am utterly lost in the world of oop php.p  pI went ahead and wrote a simple api in js just to demonstrate what Im trying to do. It could be better, but this is just a quick example. a hrefhttpjsbin.comAmIfApO3edit relnofollowhttpjsbin.comAmIfApO3edita I have attempted for weeks to achieve this functionality in php, and have failed, failed, failed. I can make it work, but its just awful code and I am determined to write it using best practices. For the sake of not appearing lazy, heres the latest php rewrite I tried....ended in disaster like always a hrefhttppastebin.comcKw9YeVz relnofollowhttppastebin.comcKw9YeVza.p  pWith js, I eventually saw the right example got the right advice and the idea became pretty clear. I think that seeing even just the basic design flow of how this would be done in php would probably help me tie in everything Ive learned. Something just hasnt clicked. If you can give me an example of what classes I should have here or how to divide things up, I would be so appreciative.p  pedit to further clarify what Im struggling with the most is just the bones of an application. There are so many ways to accomplish the same thing. I understand how to package things up in classes and inheritance, I just dont know how those things should be used.

Negative 7917 pI need to disable scrolling of items with mouse wheel for all combo components on the form. Best of all is to have more or less general solution, because design of the form may change, it would be nice if new combo components will be ignored without any additional work with sourcecode. I have two types of combo TComboBox and TcxComboBox from DevExpress ExpressBars Suit. I tried to go this wayp  precodeprocedure TSomeForm.FormMouseWheelSender TObject Shift TShiftState WheelDelta Integer MousePos TPoint   var Handled Boolean begin   if Screen.ActiveControl is TComboBox or Screen.ActiveControl is TcxComboBox then     Handled  True end codepre  pIt works fine for TComboBox, but this event handler never triggered when TcxComboBox has focus. I tried to catch corresponding messages on the level of the form like thisp  precodeprocedure TSomeForm.WndProcvar m TMessage begin   if m.Msg  WMVSCROLL or m.Msg  WMHSCROLL or m.msg  WMMousewheel then     m.Msg  0   inherited end codepre  pBut such messages never come to this handler. I tried to directly disable mouse wheel handling for TcxComboBox, because it has such propertyp  precodeprocedure TSomeForm.FormCreateSender TObject begin   cxComboBox1.Properties.UseMouseWheel  False end codepre  pBut it doesnt work, it is still possible to scroll items with mouse wheel. I posted support ticket for this issue, but even if they fix it in next release i need some solution now.p  pAny ideas, maybe someone solved it somehow p
Negative 7917 pHi I am running scientific computing using numpy  numba. Ive realized that numpy array addition inplace is very slow... compared to matlabp  phere is the matlab codep  precodetic  A,B are 2d matrices, ind may not be distinct for ii1N      Aindii,   Aindii,   Bii, end toc codepre  pand here is the numpy codep  precodes  time.time  A,B are numpy.ndarray, ind may not be distinct for k in xrangeN      A[ind[k],]  B[k,] print time.time  s codepre  pThe result shows that numpy code is 10x slower than matlab... which confuses me a lot.p  pMoreover, when I pull the addition out of for loop, and just compare a single matrix addition with numpy.add, numpy and matlab seem to be comparable at speed. p  pOne factor I know is that matlab uses JIT for version2012a to speed up for loop, but I tried numba on python code, it still does not speed up even a bit. I think this has to do with that numba has not touched numpy.add function at all, hence the performance does not change at all.p  pI am guessing that matlab does some sick caching for this case, hence it beats numpy dramatically. p  pAny suggestion on how to speed up numpy p

Negative 7917 pIm trying to design a new database structure and was wondering of any advantagesdisadvantages of using onetomany vs manytomany relationships between tables for the following example.p  pLets say we need to store information about clients, products, and their addresses each client and product may have numerous different addresses such as shipping and billing.p  pOne way of achieving this is img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comMngIo.png altOnetomany relationshipsp  pThis is a rather straight forward approach where each relationship is of onetomany type, but involves creating additional tables for each address type.p  pOn the other hand we can create something like this img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comeGOy3.png altManytomany relationshipsp  pThis time we simply store an additional type field indicating what kind of address it is ClientBilling 0, ClientShipping 1, ProductContact 2 and sourceid which is either Clients.ID or Products.ID depending on the type fields value.p  pThis way Addresses table doesnt have a direct link to any other tables, but the structure seems to be a lot simpler.p  pMy question is if either of those approaches have any significant advantages or is it just a matter of preference Which one would you choose Are there any challenges I should be aware of in the future while extending the database Are there any significant performance differencesp  pThank you.p

Negative 7917 pI hope to realtime communicate with verilog simulation, just like I type a number at some where and verilog simulation can read it and show it. So I find a way that use readwrite a file to communicate. First I write a c program to scanf what I type in the terminal and realtime change a number in a specific file. Then I thought if the verilog keep fscanf the file, it can communicate. I wrote the verilog code below, it works but not very good. If I type 1  9 each for one second, it will lose about six numbers. I hope all the number I type can be read by verilog. I use ncverilog to compile. Can anyone tell me how to fix my verilog or there are another way to communicate with verilog.

This is strange, because codeplayerapi video.csszoom, resetcode does. So something is specifically strange with the elements style width and height. We can see this by looking furtherp  pFrom the emcontent scriptem I must set codeplayerapi video.get0.style.width  1920pxcode or use codevideo  playerapi video.get0code and set the codevideo.style.widthcode. This is because codeplayerapi videocode has no style property. However setting the codestyle.widthcode from any codefoo.get0code will not change the elements style.p  pFinally, from the console if I try to use the method codeplayer gt video.widthcode directly, I find it is a property and it is not set to anything. Setting this property has no effect on the elements style, but it is at least there. But from the emcontent scriptem it is a method which has no effect on the element.p  pWhy does the HTML5VideoElement behave like this Typically elements never require using code.get0code to inspect or manipulate.p  pAnd emhow can I change the element style width and height of an HTML5 video element from a Chrome extensions strongcontent scriptstrongemp

Negative 7917 pMy issue with arraylists is simple I have a class called Score, it consists of an integer called myScore and a Name class not relevant called myPlayerName. I have an arraylist of these Scores called scoreList, and i want to be able to print out the ten highest scores in that list a top ten list if you will, but when i call a collections.sort method on the arraylist, it seems to return an error. I think this may be because of the fact that my score class has two parameters. how can I order an arrayList based on a specific part of an element. Is it possible to sort them by the score integerp

Negative 7917 pI have a Panel with various child controls on it.  I assigned a context menu to the Panel and it comes up whether I right click on the Panel or on the controls... except for the TextBox control because it comes with its own built in context menu.p  pI would rather not have to set the context menu on controls directly because they are dynamically generated, and they are generated in a dll outside of the GUI that Im using them on.

Negative 7917 pIve a program written in python3 gtk webkit, and would like to start using some fonts in the CSS and HTML files. I see fontsquirrel creates four different types of fonts, and the CSS for them. p  pNow Im not sure, but I believe that different font types are just for cross browser compatibility And I cant upload compiled files so I would like to just use the SVG format of the font file. p  pI believe the CSS for this would be just bep  precodefontface      fontfamily comfortaaregular     src urlfontcomfortaaregularwebfont.svgcomfortaaregular formatsvg     fontweight normal     fontstyle normal   codepre  pAnd then I think I could just set a useragent inside of the program that is most compatible with SVG formats.p  pSo my question is, first off all is my assumption correct, and if so what useragent will work best with SVG, and second of all how compatible will this method be with other peoples computers. p

Negative 7917 pSorry for a basic question. Im sure the answer is quite simple, but Ive banged my head against a wall for a while trying to figure it out. Im new to python, but I understand the concept of vectorized computations. For instance, in the following pretty trivial piece of codep  precodeimport pandas as pd  ndx  [a, b, c, d, e, f] first  [3, 7, 2, 5, 9, 4] second  [8, 9, 7, 3, 3, 7]  first  pd.DataFramefirst, index  ndx second  pd.DataFramesecond, index  ndx codepre  pI know that first  second will return a boolean array, True where each element in a is greater than the corresponding element in b, matching the indexes. I understand that this rigid index matching is one of the benefits of using pandas, but...p  pQuestion how can I efficiently reference offset indexes in a vectorized operation For instance, what if I want to compare the next value in b with the current value in a first[a]  second[b], first[b]  second[c], ... Along the same lines, what if I want to return True only if first[a] is greater than both second[a] and second[b] p  pIve written some code that does things like this iterating through the array by index. Heres an examplep  precode        if next.at[curr.index[i], OI] gt curr.OI[i] and          next.at[curr.index[i1], OI] gt curr.OI[i1] and          next.at[curr.index[i], Vol] gt curr.Vol[i] and          next.at[curr.index[i1], Vol] gt curr.Vol[i1] codepre  pnext and curr are DataFrames. OI and Vol are columns in those dataframes and i is my counter. I know this is not pythonic and its also super slow which... hmmm... might be why its not pythonic lolp  pThank you in advance.p  pSummary general question is how to reference offset elements in pandas and numpy. p  pEDIT Thank you to Jaime and TomAugspurger for the answers for np and pd below. Got it... makes sense.p  pFollowup question How can I implement the pandas shift with dataframes that are different lengths Imagine I have two time series that overlap but one extends before and the other extends after the other. So there are nonmatching values in each index, and the indexes are almost certainly different lengths. pandas will not allow shift with this errorp  precode ValueError                                Traceback most recent call last ltipythoninput1535914edbe0ffgt in ltmodulegt gt 1 aa  q[OI] gt r[OI]  CPython27libsitepackagespandascoreops.pyc in wrapperself, other     540             name  maybematchnameself, other     541             if lenself  lenother gt 542                 raise ValueErrorSeries lengths must match to compare     543             return self.constructornaopself.values, other.values,     544                                      indexself.index, namename  ValueError Series lengths must match to compare codepre  pI suppose I could do a step and take the set defined by the union of the indexes, but that seems like an inefficient extra step. Im trying to learn correct coding practice as much or more than simply getting my project to work. Any ideas on this Thank you in advance.p

Negative 7917 pIm currently trying to implement an autoresizing textarea, based on the popular technique found here a hrefhttpalistapart.comarticleexpandingtextareasmadeelegant relnofollowAlistapart Expanding Textareas 2011a.p  pThe concept is pretty simple you mirror a textareas input with a backing pre element. As the pre element resizes, its container and the absolutely positioned textarea grow with it.

The key to this technique is to make sure that the pre element exactly mirrors the textareas behavior  not only in size, but also in font characteristics, and wrapping points.p  pIve set up this a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netthauburger3LXxE relnofollowJSFiddlea to demonstrate.p  pThe textareas content is in red, while the pres content is in blue.

Negative 7917 pI have a class whose objects use system resources creating temporary files, for example that need to be cleaned up. At the very least, this needs to happen when the program ends. So far Ive been using codecontextmanagercode to do this, for examplep  precodecontextlib.contextmanager def tempdirprefixtmp     tmpdir  tempfile.mkdtempprefixprefix     try         yield tmpdir     finally         shutil.rmtreetmpdir  with tempdir as tmp    dosomethingtmp codepre  pThis ensures that the resources are released as soon as Im done with them, and this works well for most of my purposes. However, I find that this model breaks down when using python interactively, for example in codeipythoncode. In this case, the entire session would need to be inside a codewithcode block, which isnt very practical in fact, codeipythoncode will only evaluate blocks all at once, so the whole interactivity would disappear.p  pIs there a way to ensure cleanup of resources while still staying usable in interactive sessions In codeCcode this could be achieved by putting the cleanup in the destructor. The python codedelcode statement is similar, but I have been told that codedelcode is unreliable and should be avoided. In particular, it is a hrefhttpdocs.python.org2referencedatamodel.htmlobject.del relnofollowit is not guaranteed that codedelcode will be called for objects that still exist when the interpreter exitsa.. Is this one of the cases where codedelcode is still the best solution And if the codecontextmanagercode approach is incompatible with interactive sessions, why is it recommended as the most pythonic approachp

Negative 7917 pSay I have this generic classp  precodeabstract class FooltTgt where T  IBar codepre  pThis is fine up to here, however I would like to also be able to pass codedoublecode as well. Now I have been told that this is a bad idea and that the only way to solve this problem is to write a duplicate class handling the double case. I have also been told that toying with primitive types like this is not a good idea.p  pWhat I thought about doing was wrapping codedoublecode in a class that implements codeIBarcode. This would allow me to use the wrapped double. I can for see some problems with usage of the class and I have again been told that wrapping primitive types for these kinds of purposes is a bad idea.p  ul liWhat would be a good way to go around thisli liIs it time for me to reconsider using doublesli liShould I just go with creating a separate duplicate class to handle doubles in my opinion this sounds as if I am not reusing.li liWhat is the rule of thumb if there is one when having to deal with primitives in a generic wayli ul  pThe structs that are catagorised are codedoublecode which we know of and a codeBigRationalcode struct. This is a representation of a quotient between two codeSystem.Numerics.BigIntegercode members. Arithmetic is fully defined on this struct and what codeFoocode is doing with codeTcode should be defined for codedoublecode and codeBigRationalcode.p  pNow the apposing reason is that these are emunrelatedem and therefore it is embad practiceem to create an interface to unite them not to mention wrapping the primitive in the first place.p  pMy idea for the codeIBarcode interface was to have arithmetic as a requirement. Now in the future if I attempt to use codeFoocode for other classesstructs that implement codeIBarcode it should be fine. strongBut I want codedoublecode to work as well.strong So now what I am looking for is a good reason to even wrap codedoublecode in the first place and how this would coincide with good practice.p

Negative 7917 pI would like to set things up on my mobile app so that the header and footer toolbars behave like the video controls in Netflix that is, they appear on load disappear after a few seconds then reappear when the screen is clicked.  The default behaviour for these classes in JQM is for them to appear on load, then disappearreappear on subsequent clicks. I could do it something like thisp  ol liHave the bars appear on loadli lipSet a timeout to hide the bars, sop  precodewindow.setTimeoutfunction    footer.hide   header.hide , 3000 codepreli lipBind an event to the window so that a click anywhere within it when the bars are hidden has them reappear unbind the event until the timeout kicks inpli liRinse and repeat There are various refinements one could put in have the bars disappear if you click before the timeout, etc.li ol  pSounds simple enough.  Turns out to be difficult, because it appears to conflict with JQMs own way of having headers etc appear and disappear on mouse clicks.  So adding this function, attaching a click event to bring back the headers, leads to erratic behaviour, with the headers appearing and disappeariing in random waysp  precode   function resetTimer          document.bindclick,function            footer.show            header.show            window.setTimeoutfunction                footer.hide                header.hide               resetTimer           , 5000                    window.setTimeoutfunction         footer.hide        header.hide        resetTimer      , 5000 codepre  pAny ideas surely there is a better way to do this than this draconian fiddling with global windows and document events. If I remove the attributes codedataroleheadercode etc from the divs holding the header and footer, everything appears fine  but I lose the automatic positioning and other behaviours offered by JQM, which would mean a painful reconstruction of their coding. But I cant find in the JQM documents etc anyway to do this...p

Negative 7917 pApologies if this is a newbie question...  In Scala I understand that it is preferred to use an codeOptioncode rather than returning codenullcode when you have a function which returns an instance but could potentially return nothing. I understand that this makes it better with regards to safety, because you are not passing null references around, and risking codeNullPointerExceptioncode somewhere down the line. p  pHowever, is there a cleaner way to handle options than using pattern matching  The syntax I end up using is the following p  precodeval optObj  Option[MyObject]  myFunctionThatReturnsOption optObj match    case Someobj gt    my code using obj       case None gt   codepre  pIn reality all this doing is the equivalent of the Java versionp  precodeMyObject obj  myMethodThatCanReturnNull if obj  null    my code using obj  codepre  pIs there some other way to avoid all this boilerplate in Scala when using codeOptioncode instead of codenullcode references All I want to do is execute a piece of code as long as the codeOptioncode contains some object i.e. is not codeNonecode. p

Negative 7917 pI have a goodish understanding of using Maven for JavaWebApp projects but only to the point of following the default goalslifecycle. p  pHowever I now have a Backup project which is not a Java project at all. I was thinking of configuring it with Maven to keep some consistency but am not sure how I override the main Maven goalsphases for my bespoke processing.p  pThe Backup project needs to do the following build  initially, the backup outputs will be a mysql database dump file and a zip exported from an existing WebApp. But I want it to be flexible so calling an ant file to do the actual work creating the dump, calling the WebApp, or doing whatever in the future seems sensible. The output files could then be copied into the target directory.p  pinstall  publish the output files to a local repository, preferably providing a datetimestamp version number instead of the usual 1.0.0SNAPSHOT version. Id like to think that Maven can cope with an artefact being a collection of files, rather than a single jarwar, but not sure on this.p  pMy pom.xml declares the packaging as pom as jar and war dont seem appropriate here.p  pI then want other projects to be able to have a dependency on this Backup project so they can get the lastest backup artefacts if required.p  p1 how do I override the maven compile goal to call an ant build file p  p2 how do I override the maven install goal to publish all files in the target directory but as a single artefactp  pAny helpguidance appreciated.p

The last button is located to the left of the second button and at a fixed distance.p  pAfter this the browser should again load the page where the objects arrive and its rinse repeat. If there is no new object I want the script to do nothing and just refresh the page once every minute or so.p  pSo my question is areound the doability of this And where the best place would be to start and what to look for At first I thought itd be piece of cake but now I am not so sure naymore....p  pThanksp

Negative 7917 pI have a csvfile that is about 100 mb small. Then I have plenty of memory, about 8 Gb. At runtime I dont have more than, at conservative guess, say 10 codepandas.DataFramescode that contain the whole csvfile. So pretty sure not more than 2 Gb of memory should be needed. codegetsizeofdataframecode also does not return a huge number. Then in a function, I do the following Finding an interesting value, let it be an outliner of say the motor current. Then plot 10 seconds about 300 data points around this point in a graph with codebokehcode and moreover 4 other graphs for motor voltage, motor speed and so on. This function is plotting about 50 graphs all the same way in a forloop. Variables are defined locally, so they are overwritten each loop. Now the big question Why is my memory getting fuller each iteration Sometimes it reaches about 7 Gb and I get a memory error. I dont see how my data is getting that big internally. The memory thing even occurs with csvfiles of 10 mb of size.p

Negative 7917 pCurrently, I have an aspx page in vb that launches a RadHTMLChart and I want to grab the SVG code of that chart. However, since the chart is rendered clientside, I have to launch this aspx page and then grab the SVG code from a second aspx page during postback. Currently, I am using Server.Execute firstpage.aspx to grab the SVG code but this does not work. I want to use the SVG to generate a PDF document but the Server.Execute command seems to run in the background and the code that comes after it do not wait for it to finish first, hence I am not grabbing the SVG content.

Negative 7917 pFirst of all, I am pretty new to AWS, so my question might seem very amateur.p  pI am a developing a web application which needs to available globally and currently am hosting it on amazon. Since the application is still under development, i have set it up in the Singapore region. However, when i test the application, i get good response times from locations on the the east side of the globe50ms. However, when i test the response times from the US, its 550ms. So we decided to have 2 instances one in Singapore and one in the US. But im not able to figure out a way to handle data replication and load balancing across regions. Elastic Beanstalk only allows me to do this in a particular region. Can somebody please explain how i can achieve global availability for my web app. The following are the services i currently use. 1. Amazon EC2 2. Amazon S3p  pI need both database replication and S3 file replication. Also it would be great if there was a way where i just need to deploy my application on one place and the changes are reflected across all the instances we would have on the globe.p

Negative 7917 pIm using Google Maps v3 api in my web application, and it is working great in Chrome, IE, Safari, Opera but not in Firefox. Basically, what is supposed to happen is the map gets initialized and then markers are placed on the map for any database addresses within the bounds of the map. The map loads quickly in the working browsers less than 1 second and the markers are displayed. Firefox takes over 5 seconds to load the map, and Im thinking that this lag causes the markers to not display. This idea was reinforced by the fact that when I debug my javascript using Firebug, the markers get displayed correctly. I have tried the followingp  precode       function InitializeMap              gm  google.maps             map  new gm.Mapdocument.getElementByIdmap,                  zoom zoomLevel                           google.maps.event.triggermap, resize              oms  new OverlappingMarkerSpiderfiermap,  markersWontMove true, markersWontHide true               if navigator.geolocation                  navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPositionfunction position                      var geolocate  new google.maps.LatLngposition.coords.latitude, position.coords.longitude                     map.setCentergeolocate                                           else                  alertNo geolocation support                           google.maps.event.addListenermap, zoomchanged, function                   zoomLevel  map.getZoom                 CallHandler                           google.maps.event.addListenermap, dragend, function                   zoomLevel  map.getZoom                 CallHandler                           google.maps.event.addListenerOncemap, idle, function                   google.maps.event.triggermap, resize                  Load Markers                 CallHandler                           google.maps.event.addListenerOncemap, tilesloaded, function                   this part runs when the mapobject is created and rendered                 google.maps.event.addListenerOncemap, tilesloaded, function                       this part runs when the mapobject shown for the first time                     google.maps.event.triggermap, resize                     CallHandler                                        codepre  pThe tiles loaded event did not work either.p  pAny help on this is appreciated.

Negative 7917 pHi all so Im trying to work with this set of data that has two columns, one is names and the other is the number of births for each name. What I want to do is import a csv file, perform some basic functions on it such as finding the baby name with the maximum number of births, and then plotting the data in a bar graph. But, when I have an index value for the dataframe, the bar graph prints that as the x axis instead of the names. So I removed the index and now I get all kinds of errors. Below is my code, first the one with the index and then the one without. Thanks in advance.

In Greenplum to use compression I need to use append only table types meaning the row cannot be directly updated safely. p  pSo, in my inexperienced head, I believe an approach to this could be to have two tables  one holding the rows while they are allowed to be updated which can use standard HEAP storage and has no compression, and one holding only those that have become static the vast majority which is in columnar orientation and is compressed.p  pClearly there are mechanics involved that make life more complex unioning the two if I want to look at emeverythingem, triggering the deletion from one table and insertion into the other when the row becomes static, etc etc so Id really appreciate hearing about a real life solution to this problem.p  pThanksp  pAndy.p

Negative 7917 pIm using the set scale and segmented line tools in ImageJ to make linear measurements on a photograph.

Negative 7917 pI have a php Form class designed to validate form input. However, Ive run into some unexpected behavior when implementing an codeisEmailEmptycode function. Here is my codep  precodeclass Form  var userEmail var userPassword var hashedPassword var requiredPassLength  6  public function constructuserEmail, userPassword      thisgtuserEmail  thisgtcleanInputuserEmail     thisgtuserPassword  thisgtcleanInputuserPassword   public function cleanInputdataField      dataField  trimdataField     dataField  stripslashesdataField     dataField  htmlspecialcharsdataField     return dataField   public function isEmailEmpty      return thisgtuserEmail    thisgtuserEmail  null  true  false   public function isPasswordEmpty      return thisgtuserPassword    thisgtuserPassword  null  true  false   public function isEmailValid      return filtervarthisgtuserEmail, FILTERVALIDATEEMAIL   public function isPasswordValid      return strlenthisgtuserPassword gt thisgtrequiredPassLength  true  false   public function hashPassword      return thisgthashedPassword  passwordhashthisgtuserPassword, PASSWORDBCRYPT   More functions down here... codepre  pNow, lets say Ive instantiated an object in the following way brp  precodeuserEmail  exampleexample.com userPassword  rootatoot form  new FormuserEmail, userPassword codepre  pSince my codeisEmailValidcode function returns a bool, I expect to receive a boolean return value, i.e, truefalse or 10 upon excecution. However, that is not the case. Instead, when the expression evaluates to true, I get a string output of the email value tested. For instance, given the object instantiated above, the statement codeecho formgtisEmailValidcode outputs codeexampleexample.comcode. Running codegettypeformgtisEmailValidcode returns codestringcode, which also was not expected. Whats even more curious the codeisPasswordValidcode function does NOT behave this way. Running codeformgtisPasswordValidcode returns code1code if the password is in fact valid. Running codegettypeformgtisPasswordValidcode returns codebooleancode, as expected. Its also interesting that my code still works as expected. For instance, the blockp  precodeif formgtisEmailValid        echo Valid email  else        echo Invalid email  codepre  palways gives the correct output. Even though my code is running as expected, its still important to understand whats happening behind the scenes and why. So, my questions regarding this behavior arep  ol liWhat is responsible for a bool function returning a string For instance, was this by design or a byproduct of some other process li liAre there any scenarios where this unexpected return value can cause a problem Or does the system understand this evaluation and always handles it as accordingly My code works fine now, but I dont think its farfetched to anticipate unexpected return values causing some issues sooner or later.  li ol  pI appreciate any information you can provide. Thanksp

Negative 7917 pMy node application is making requests to two Servers, A and B.  To server A, it waits for one request to finish before making the next one.  To server B it makes 20 requests a second without waiting.  When Im making the requests to Server B, the requests to Server A take a very long time.

The requests to server B pile up, but there are no more than a few hundred in process simultaneously.p  pIve run the exact same application, with the same node version on a Joyent smartos instance and I dont have this problem, so I assume its an issue with the limits the operating system sets, and not with the limits that node sets.

I used test data from this site  a hrefhttpvision.middlebury.edumviewdata relnofollowhttpvision.middlebury.edumviewdataa They have images along with camera matrix, rotation and translation matrices. The problem is that stereoRectify returns a vertically aligned images Vertical stereo so the epipolar lines are vertical.

Does anyone have similar experience with this Is there a way some parameter maybe to make stereoBM or stereoSGBM work with vertically rectified imagesp

Negative 7917 pIm creating an app with a service and my hope is to be able to blur the screen at any point, even when the app is in the background.p  pIve create a Service that, when the alert is called, creates a transparent View on the top of the Window. This is where Im stuck though. There doesnt seem to be anyway to grab what is on the screen without root to create the blur effect and put it on this top view.  p  pIs there anyway I can make this work Is there anyway to grab the current screen outside of my app Or, could I do something with the transparent view to make whats underneath blurry, like looking through a blurred windowp
Negative 7917 pI just started trying out SailsJS a few days ago.br Ive realized that the Node is terminated whenever I have an uncaught exception.br I have a list of controllers and each of them calls a specific service JS file Containing logics and DB calls in services.br Can I write a global error handler for all services so that any type of error that occurs from these services should be handled by it and appropriate error response has to be communicated to frontend.  p  pI tried using process.onuncaughtexception or some of basic exceptions but it needs to be added to each service method.p  pAlso can I have one common point for all service calls made from client to server through which all io.socket.post and io..socket.get goes throughp  pI would appreciate any pointerarticle that would show me the common best practices for handling uncaught exceptions in SailsJS and using shorter code rather than writing redundant code in all services.p

Any thoughts on what I am doing wrongp  pThanks.p  pThe code below shows how the renderloop changes between the using the outputTexture and not using it.p  precodeRenderLoop.Runform,  gt      if isFormClosed              return           bool useTexture  true     if useTexture              context.ClearDepthStencilViewdepthStencilView, DepthStencilClearFlags.Depth, 1, 0         context.OutputMerger.SetTargetsdepthStencilView, outputTextureRenderTargetView         context.ClearRenderTargetViewoutputTextureRenderTargetView, new Color41, 1, 0, 1         context.PixelShader.SetShaderResource0, textureResource         context.DrawIndexedindexCount, 0, 0         context.Flush           context.ClearDepthStencilViewdepthStencilView, DepthStencilClearFlags.Depth, 1, 0     context.OutputMerger.SetTargetsdepthStencilView, renderTargetView     if useTexture              context.PixelShader.SetShaderResource0, outputTextureShaderResourceView          else              context.PixelShader.SetShaderResource0, textureResource          context.DrawIndexedindexCount, 0, 0     swapChain.Present0, PresentFlags.None    codepre  pProbably these are the most interesting parts of the initialization codep  precode int width  800  int height  600  ...  var ProjectionMatrix  Matrix.PerspectiveLHwidth, height, 10, 10  var WorldMatrix  Matrix.Identity  Vector3 position  new Vector3width  2, height  2, 10  Vector3 lookAt  new Vector3width  2, height  2, 9  Vector3 up  new Vector30, 1, 0  var ViewMatrix  Matrix.LookAtLHposition, lookAt, up  ... var vertices  new[]       Bottom left.     new Vertex              position  new Vector30, 0, 0,         texture  new Vector20, 1     ,      Top left.     new Vertex              position  new Vector30, height, 0,         texture  new Vector20, 0     ,      Bottom right.     new Vertex              position  new Vector3width, 0, 0,         texture  new Vector21, 1     ,      Top right.     new Vertex              position  new Vector3width, height, 0,         texture  new Vector21, 0        Texture2DDescription outputTextureDescription  new Texture2DDescription      ArraySize  1,     BindFlags  BindFlags.RenderTarget  BindFlags.ShaderResource,     CpuAccessFlags  CpuAccessFlags.None,     Format  Format.R32G32B32A32Float,     Height  width,     Width  height,     MipLevels  1,     OptionFlags  ResourceOptionFlags.None,     SampleDescription  new SampleDescription1, 0,     Usage  ResourceUsage.Default  Texture2D outputTexture  new Texture2Ddevice, outputTextureDescription  var renderTargetViewDesc  new RenderTargetViewDescription      Format  outputTextureDescription.Format,     Dimension  RenderTargetViewDimension.Texture2D  renderTargetViewDesc.Texture2D.MipSlice  0 var outputTextureRenderTargetView  new RenderTargetViewdevice, outputTexture, renderTargetViewDesc  var shaderResourceViewDesc  new ShaderResourceViewDescription      Format  outputTextureDescription.Format,     Dimension  ShaderResourceViewDimension.Texture2D,  shaderResourceViewDesc.Texture2D.MipLevels  1 shaderResourceViewDesc.Texture2D.MostDetailedMip  0  Create the render target view. var outputTextureShaderResourceView  new ShaderResourceViewdevice, outputTexture, shaderResourceViewDesc codepre

Negative 7917 pI have a widget whose xml layout is simple an codeImageViewcode and a codeTextViewcode.p  pI can hardcode the rotation of the codeTextViewcode in the xml by using codeandroidrotationcode.p  pHowever I want to be able to set the rotation of the codeTextViewcode programmatically.  It seems that a codeViewcode has a codesetRotationcode method, so the codeTextViewcode will inherit this method, such that a normal codeTextViewcode can be rotated programmatically used this method.p  pBut when the codeTextViewcode is buried within a codeRemoteViewscode, you have to call the methods indirectly, like codesetTextViewTextcode and codesetTextViewTextSizecode.p  pAnd it also seems that you can call the general codesetFloatint viewId, String methodName, float valuecode to set the value of any codemethodNamecode, so you can set text size also via passing codesetTextSizecode to codesetFloatcode.p  pOK to the question....p  pSince there isnt a codesetTextViewRotationcode method in codeRemoteViewscode, I figure I need to call that indirectly using codesetFloatviewId, setRotation, valuecode.p  pBut when I try that, my widget just shows a Problem Loading Widget message box.p  pIt works with e.g. codesetFloatviewId, setTextSize, valuecode to change the text size, so Im on the right track, but it doesnt work for codesetRotationcode in the same place in my code.p  pIm guessing that its because codesetRotationcode is an inherited method from codeViewcode, rather than a method of codeTextViewcode itself, but it leaves me slightly stuck as to how to rotation my codeTextViewcode.p  pAny ideasp  pThanksp

Negative 7917 pIn the JSTL codefmtcode tag library is the tag codeformatDatecode, which has an optional attribute codevarcode. When using the codeformatDatecode tag, you can pass in a string via the codevarcode attribute that specifies the name of the variable that will be created, whose value will be the formatted date string.p  pUnfortunately, Java as of Java 8 doesnt support the Tongan and Samoan locales, which I need. Therefore, a coworker created a custom date formatting tag that basically just formats the date using codefmtformatDatecode but then in the case of Tongan and Samoan replaces the day name and month name values with the appropriate translations. However, this custom tag only outputs using codecoutcode the result, and Id like to enhance the custom tag to be able to create a variable, just like codefmtformatDatecode does. Unfortunately, I dont know how.p  pcodecsetcode doesnt allow expressions in its codevarcode attribute, and for some reason codepageContextcode is null inside the custom tag file dateformatter.tag.p  pSo heres what I have for the tag definition, minus extraneous details assume the codeccode and codefmtcode taglibs are included, as well as the codedateFormatterLocalecode variablep  precodeltattribute namevalue typejava.util.Date requiredtrue rtexprvaluetrue description... gt ltattribute nametype requiredtrue rtexprvaluetrue description... gt ltattribute namepattern requiredtrue rtexprvaluetrue description... gt ltattribute namevar requiredfalse rtexprvaluefalse description... gt  ltfmtformatDate typetype patternpattern valuevalue vardfFormattedDate gt ltcif testdateFormatterLocale  to  dateFormatterLocale  smgt     ...

Negative 7917 pI am using VS 2013 Express for Web with ADO.NET Entity Data Model.p  pWhen updating the entity data model from database using refresh tab option seems you can only select one item though the heading says select objects plural the usage seems unclear and I have noticed some issues.p  pJust two examplesp  ol lipI changed a stored procedure so it returned the same number of fields but one field was of a slightly different type but the complex type never  changed.  I realise there can be an impact on client code but this simply did not change the complex type, everything stayed the same. However, removing the relevant elements from the model browser then readding the elments from the database back into the model did exactly what I expected.pli lipI made some significant changes to two or three tables, attributes and one relationship but did bot change the table names.  Here again refresh had some very odd results, so I simply created a fresh model.pli ol  pI am planning some more changes first change specifically I am adding a FK relationship that I forgot.p  pIs there any way to be sure of what is supported and what is not in terms of refresh.p  pAlso I am concerned that if refresh fails and I so delete the two tables with the relationship, what impact will that have on temporarily orphaned tables and their relationships, and if when I regenerate the two tables their connections with the other tables will still work.  I guess it depends how the generated code works underneath.p  pI want to make these kinds of changes but avoid have to recreate the entire model.p  pAny advice appreciated.p

The new dragged ClusterItems are not clickable and so I think they are only icons that are not being removed.  Can anyone help me find a solution to this  Im guessing I need to programmatically removed the dragged icons after dragging.  Although any suggestions to solving my problem would be appreciated.p

Negative 7917 pI wrote a kernel module that sends generic Netlink multicasts, and wrote a userland client using libmnl that receives them.p  pThat all works fine, but my client works even when its not the root user, and I want to prevent that.p  pman 7 netlink saysp  precodeOnly processes with an effective UID of 0 or the CAPNETADMIN capability may send or listen to a netlink multicast group. codepre  pObviously the listen part of this is not true.

Negative 7917 pIm trying to update some code in a small personal project which uses angular to conform to better practices, and I have heard that the future of Angular can be mimicked in a way by putting a lot of functionality into controllers of directives.

Negative 7917 pI have used Gradle and Spring Boot to build an application using Neuroph. I pretrained the Neural Network on my system and placed it in the project root in the .war file. This set up works fine when I tried it on my system but after successfully deploying it on Beanstalk I get a Whitelabel Error There was an unexpected error typeInternal Server Error, status500. Class not found while trying to read neural network from file I have trained a MultiLayerPerceptron and accessing the stored neural network like belowbr  codeClassPathResource resnew ClassPathResourceCardioMlp.nnet MultiLayerPerceptron mlp  MultiLayerPerceptronNeuralNetwork.createFromFileres.getFilecodep  pThe dependency for Neuroph is like below br codedependencies  compileorg.neurophneurophcore2.9 code br  I could successfully read a text file in project root using ClassPathResource, so I dont think thats the problem. I would be grateful for any help or ideas to overcome this  or even if someone can suggest any other Neural Network library that worked on ElasticBeanstalk  Thanks in advancep

Negative 7917 pI am working on a project and I have come to a stand still . Currently, I am creating a roulette style wheel that will be rotating, the problem I have come to is creating a n amount of polygons for the wheel. I would like in the end to be able to set the n number and use a for loops to create the polygons points. I tried to use the the parametric equation of that certain circle, but the y value were incorrect being that pixels are dealt with differently. The rotation is working correctly with the Rotateicon class.

Negative 7917 pMy app has a list of documents that use a file package format. A list of these documents is shown to the user to let him pick one. In addition to the document names, the list also displays some simple metadata about every document. Currently I store this data in a file inside every document file package.p  pUnfortunately, because UIDocument is mainly geared towards iCloud, opening a UIDocument is an strongasynchronousstrong operation. This results in an empty list being displayed for a couple of frames, before the open callback is executed to display the data. However, I only need a single small file out of local documents. This should be no problem to run synchronously normally.p  pMy question is, am I allowed to go around the UIDocument provided ways to readwrite file packages and readwrite the contents directly or would that introduce weird side effects and race conditions down the roadp

Negative 7917 pI have a highprecision ODE ordinary differential equations solver written on C. I do all calculations with userdefined type coderealtypecode. There is a typedef declaring this type in the headerp  pcodetypedef long double realtypecodep  pI decided to change long double type to codefloat128code for more accuracy. In addition to this I included codequadmath.hcode and replaced all standard math functions by ones from libquadmath.p  pIf long double version is builded without any optimization flags, some reference ODE is solved in 77 seconds. If this version is builded with O3 flag, the same ODE is solved in 25 seconds. Thus O3 flag speeds up calculations in three times.p  pBut in float 128 version builded without flags similar ODE is solved in 190 seconds, and with O3 in 160 seconds  15 difference. Why O3 optimization does such a weak effect for quadruple precision calculations Maybe I should use other compiler flags or include other librariesp

Based on the generalTable.scenario you can look up more details in the other two tables, which are in some columns familiar expiresAt for example but in others not.p  pstrongMy question is, how to get the joined data of generalTable and the right detailed table in just one query.strongp  pSo, I would like a query like thisp  precodeSELECT id, scenario, expiresAt  FROM generalTable     JOIN facebookTable         ON generalTable.id  facebookTable.id     JOIN chiefTable         ON generalTable.id  chiefTable.id codepre  pAnd an output like thisp  precode id  scenario  expiresAt    1   facebook  12345678    2   chief     43547343    3   facebook  45832458    4   chief     23443355   codepre  pHowever, this doesnt work, because both facebookTable and chiefTable have ambiguous column name expiresAt. For the ease of use I want to keep it that way. The result table should also only have one column expiresAt that is automatically filled with the right values from either facebookTable or chiefTable.p  pI have the feeling, that this is actually a very easy task, but its been a long workday for me and you know the days when you think about a problem for so long and cant see the possibly easy solution. So, can you help mep  pAlso, sorry for the bad Englishp
Negative 7917 pI am working on the Joomla framework for the first time and I am having trouble configuring it.

I checked the configuration.php file and everything seems to be finelocalhost, databasename, password.  p  pI have a team of 5 people working on the same project and so I need to configure Joomla in all of the computers, so that it can be integrated easily later on.br I am using Windows 8 64bit OS and have installed wamp server 2.532 bit on my laptop. On the other hand, my teammates have Windows 7 32bit OS and have installed wamp server 2.2 onto their system.  p  pThis is because for some reason, we were unable to install wamp server 2.5 onto their system and the error message shown was missing MSVCR110.dll.br When installing this .dll file, the problem still did not resolve. When I installed wamp 2.2 onto my computer, I got an error message dont have access to the  server when I tried to access localhost. So we decided to stick to wamp 2.2 on their computers and wamp 2.5 on mine.  However, the error doesnt seem to go away.p  pWhen I tried to configure the database on wamp 2.2 and the joomla website, it seems to work fine in my computerwith wamp 2.5 however, the error appears on the other computers having wamp 2.2.

Negative 7917 pI would like to know the most efficient methodsolution using relationships to return eloquent objects from a cache or the database. p  pFor examplep  pI have a users table. Ideally I want to cache each user object individually using the key UserID.p  pAn User follows many Userp  precodeUser 1 followers [] User 2 followers [1]  User 1 follows User 2 User 3 followers [1,2]  User 1 and User 2 follows the User 3 codepre  pnow if I call user2followers or user3followers, I will get a collection of eloquent user objects. If I store in cache each collection then User 1 is stored in both cache keys and thats not good as I will have data duplication in the cache. I would like to avoid this for several reasons but mainly because it helps maintain a well structured cache system that is easy to manage and clear. Other examples could includep  pProduct row with relational Store ID which matches stores tablep  pproductwithstoreget storefind1p  pIn this scenario the store would be saved in the cache under the product key and the store key again leading to duplication in data.p  pI could create a getByID function in my model to negate this but was wondering if anyone had solved this using Eloquent p  pThanks,p  pDanielp

Negative 7917 pIm attempting to learn compilers and recursive descent parsing by example. This is not a homework assignment. Ive tried looking at a few of the other answers, but am having trouble understanding them.p  pThe example Im using is a boolean expression parser that returns the areas where the expression is valid and invalid.p  pValid syntax is whitespace, parentheses, AND, OR, and lowercase words. Lowercase words need to be separated by boolean operators i.e. cat AND mouse.p  pSome examples of how this would work p  precodecat AND mouse  cat ltvgtANDltvgt mouse cat AND mouse OR  cat ltvgtANDltvgt mouse ltigtORltigt pet OR domestic AND cat  pet ltvgtORltvgt ltigtltigtltvgtltvgtdomestic ltvgtANDltvgt cat ltvgtltvgt cat food  cat ltigtltigt food codepre  pAs you can see, what I want to output is whether each parenthesis and boolean operator is valid by surrounding it with either a v tag for valid or an i tag for invalid.p  pI believe the grammar for the language looks like this please correct me if Im wrongp  precodeExpression gt 1 or more clauses Clause gt lowercaseterm  lowercaseterm boolop lowercaseterm LowercaseTerm gt 1 or more letters from [az] BoolOp gt AND  OR codepre  pHowever, Im not too sure how to go about making a recursive descent parser from this.
