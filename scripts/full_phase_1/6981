This sounds a lot like load balancing but its primarily how to use the network to avoid a single point of failure as opposed to how to spread the work between servers.p  pThe advantages to the user are that 1 they only have to know one URL or one IP to connect to and 2 their transactions work in several different failure scenarios.  Like, if the public network near one of the sites fails or is misrouted, if the local loop for that ISP fails, if inhouse routers or servers fail.  Of course, the transactions still fail if the problem is close to the user.p
Negative 6981 pWhat is the best way to store instances of a class to filedatabasep  pWe have a base class called Command and loads of derived classes. Users create instances of these classes by adding commands to a graphical designer where they can configure them.

Negative 6981 pIm maintaining a legacy embedded device which interacts with the real world. Generally speaking, this device collects data from sensors, processes the data using its internal algorithm, and displays warning when data reaches a certain bad state.p  pFor debugging purposes, we wish this device will send us on a regular basis many of the data it receives, as well as the data after it processed it.p  pWe reached to the conclusion that most of the data can be described in a tabular form, something along the lines ofp  precodesensortimetempraturemoisture  1     301220        0.5 2     302422        0.9 codepre  pWe obviously need to support more than one form of table.p  pSo basically we need a protocol that is able to accept a certain set of tables description , and then to deliver table data according to its description.p  pAn example pseudo code for sending data isp  precodetablet table  selecttableSENSORSTABLE sensorstabledatat data[]       1,3012,20,0.5,     1,3024,22,0.9      senddatatable,data codepre  pAn example pseudo code for receiving data isp  precodedatat data  recieve switch datagttable      case SENSORSTABLE          putssensortimetempraturemoisture          for int i0iltdatagtlengthi printf              5s4s9s9sn,               datagtcell[i]gtsensor,               datagtcell[i]gttime,               datagtcell[i]gttemprature,               datagtcell[i]gtmoisture          break     case USERINPUTTABLE          ...  codepre  pDefining the tables could be done either off line both at the device and at the client computer communicating with it, or online. We can add a simple handshake protocol to agree upon tables format at the devices boottime.p  pSince this is a legacy device, it supports only RS232 communication, and since its CPU is pretty slow equivalent to 486, we cannot afford using any XMLlike data transfer methods. Those are too expensive either computationtimewise, or bandwidthwise. Sending raw SQL commands was also considered and rejected due to bandwidth considerations.p  pb[edit]bp  pFor clarification, too reduce the overhead of sending the table header each time, Im trying to avoid sending the table header each time Im sending data. So that each time Im sending a table row, Ill just have to send the tables id.p  pI also would like to note that most of the data I wish to pass is numerical, so textbased protocols are too wasteful.p  pLastly Ive seen Googles protocol buffers, its close enough but it doesnt support C.p  pb[edit]bp  pAny idea about a known protocol or implementation like what I described Any better idea to send this datap  pIm aware to the fact that this protocol is not very hard to design, I had in mind a two phase protocolp  p1 Handshake send the headers of all tables you wish to fill. Each table description would include information about the size of each column.p  p2 Data send the table index according to handshake followed by the actual data. Data will be followed by a checksum.p  pBut I wish to avoid the small details of such design, and use some readymade protocol. Or even better, use an available implementation.p

Negative 6981 pThere is this DBconnectionlike object that my web application will need. It is pretty slow to create and will be used rarely, so I would like to keep only a single instance of it around. If several requests need it at the same time, they will codelockcode the object and serialize their access.p  pTo make things more fun the object is an IDisposable and can be closed. Naturally, Ill avoid writing code that closes it, but... you know... better safe than sorry, rightp  pSo, the nave approach would be to implement it something like thisp  precodeprivate static DBClass Instance private static object DBLock  new object  public DBClass GetDB      if  Instance  null          lock DBLock              if  Instance  null                  Instance  CreateInstance     lock Instance         if  Instance.Disposed              Instance  CreateInstance     return Instance  codepre  pIt will then be used likep  precodelock var Conn  Global.GetDB        Use Conn here.  codepre  pThis will probably work most of the time, but I see an opening that could be exploited  if two threads call this at the same time, they get the same instance at the same time, and then one could still codeDisposecode it before the other acquires a codelockcode on it. Thus  later code fails. Checking for codeDisposedcode at every place that uses it also seems awkward. In fact, codelockcodeing it seems awkward too, but the instance isnt inherently threadsafe so theres nothing I can do about it.p  pHow would you implement thisp

Negative 6981 pWell here is the thing, I have written a Python script that connects to my works webpage and downloads my most recent paycheck. It works great in windows but when I move this script to my server that is running Debian it fails to redirect past the initial page. Is there a difference between the platforms Searching for hours now has not resulted in any useful information for me. I have made sure that both systems and running the same version of mechanize but the Python versions are different EDIT now both are identical, although just a bit different.p  precodeBoth systems are running identical versions of Python and mechanize.  gtgt python V Python 2.7.1 mechanize gtgt printmechanize.version 0, 2, 4, None, None codepre  pNow I have created a stripped down test script just for testing. This is so I can compare the results easily. In Windows the script will return the final page that contains a list of all the paychecks available while in Linux it will only print the initial page that should be redirecting to the login page. I feel that mechanize under Linux is either not redirecting at all or it is just not setting a cookie that is needed to proceed. p  pAny ideas suggestions I am basically asking if there is a difference in mechanize between Windows and Linux. Since the package contents are from the same source my guess is no but then what is causing this issuep  pHere is the code that I am using to test.

Negative 6981 pI have a change password page that needs to hash any passwords entered on the page via Javascript before sending. To complicate it, the page is loaded via a jQuery load call, and is submitted by a jQuery.Form ajaxForm call. Had everything working in MVC2, but MVC3 is giving me trouble.p  pThat is, I have a page with a Change Password link that when clicked, loads the change password page into a jQuery modal popup, then the form on the change password page gets submitted via the jQuery.Form library Essentially just wraps a .ajax call, and returns its result into the modal same modal popup.p  pEssentially, I have a model with two properties, OldPassword and NewPassword. I have two hidden fields generated by by view for these. They hold the hashed value of two other fields, PrehashOldPassword and PrehashNewPassword, and get updated via keyup events I know, this means it does a whole SHA256 hash on every keyup... inefficient, but got the job doen for testing. The key here is that the regex validation and required field validation needs to be executed on these Prehash fields, which exist on the client side only As obviously I dont want to transmit these fields to the server in any way.p  pSo I manually create these two and add on the dataval attributes to the elements, i.e. they are NOT generated by the MVC helpers, etc. I am guessing that this is where Im missing something. When the form submits with all fields empty, all of the errors popup that should, but the form goes right ahead and submits anyway. p  pp  pSo the things Ive triedp  pYes, the unobtrusive library parse method already gets called to parse the AJAX loaded form contents, and it appears to get all of the data validation stuff correctly, since I see the errors show up as fields blur, and when I hit submit before the ajax request completes and replaces the content of the popup.p  pPossible note this call to the unobtrusive librarys parse method happens AFTER the AJAX successfully loads the change password page into the popup... the AJAX form submit binding is put on document.ready of the loaded content, ergo, the AJAX form submission binding MAY be binding prior to, and thus firing before, the validation calls that the parse method may bind to the submit event... p  pHowever, 1 I am doing this same sort of thing in other places without issue, the ONLY DIFFERENCE being that I am manually putting these dataval attributes on elements I am creating manually And 2, if I cause some kind of error on the OldPassword or NewPassword fields, i.e. a required field validation error by not loading a value into them, they display their error, and successfully STOP the form from submitting through the jQuery.Form method.p  pSo I think something has to be wrong herep  precodeltinput idPrehashNewPassword typepassword namePrehashNewPassword datavalrequiredThe password field is required. datavalregexpatternlt RegexHelper.PasswordRegularExpression gt datavalregexlt RegexHelper.PasswordRegularExpressionError gt datavaltrue gt codepre  pI know that jquery.validate is getting the rules right, since I DO see the errors. Its just not stopping the form from submitting when their is an error in these manually generated elements, unless I do something like this, and add a presubmit callback on the forms AJAX submissionp  precode        ChangePasswordForm.ajaxForm             beforeSubmit function   if ChangePasswordForm.valid  return false  ,             target overlay          codepre  pWhile this works, it is kind of ugly and I believe it causes the validation to be called twice... Not a huge deal, but less than ideal. So is there some other call that I need to make in the unobtrusive library to bind thesep

Negative 6981 pIm interested in sequentiallyconsistent load operation on x86.

Negative 6981 pAre there any good if possible scientific resources available web or books about overlap processing. I am not that interested in the effects of using overlap processing and windows when analyzing a signal, since the requirements are different. It is more about the following Real Time situation I am currently dealing with audio signals p  ul liDividing a signal into smaller parts.li liCreating overlap windows. li liFFTing the windowed chunks.li liDo processing in the frequency domain.li liIFFT the results.li liput the chunks together to a continuous stream.li ul  pI am especially interested in the influence of the window used on the resulting error as well as the effect of the overlap length. However I couldnt find any good resources that deal with the subject in detail. Any suggestionsp  pstrongEditstrongp  pAfter some discussions if using a window function is appropriate, I found a decent handout explaining the overlap and addsave method. a hrefhttpwww.ece.tamu.edudeepaecen448handouts08c10OverlapSaveAddhandouts.pdf relnofollowhttpwww.ece.tamu.edudeepaecen448handouts08c10OverlapSaveAddhandouts.pdfap  pHowever, after doing some tests, I noticed that the windowed version would perform more accurate in most cases than the overlap amp addsave method. Could anybody confirm this  I dont want to jump to any conclusions regarding computation time though....p  pstrongEdit2strongp  pHere are some graphs from my testsp  pI created a signal, which consists of three cosine waves img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comlyeqr.png altenter image description herep  pI used this filter function in the time domain for filtering. Its symmetric, as it is applied to the whole output of the FFT, which also is symmetric for real input signals img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comQWueP.png altenter image description herep  pThe output of the IFFT looks like this It can be seen that low frequencies are attenuated more than frequency in the mid range. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comwdgA4.png altenter image description herep  pFor the overlap addsave and the windowed processing I divided the input signal into 8 chunks of 256 samples.

This is the error which leads to different results when comparing windowed process and overlap addsave. The windowed process is closer to the one processed in one big junk.p  pHowever, I have no idea why they are there or if  they shouldnt be there at all.p

Negative 6981 pI need to keep track of the p  ul liCreatedByUserIdli liModifiedByUserIdli liCreatedDateTimeli liModifiedDateTimeli ul  pfor most of my entities. Pretty standard.p  pDo you think its better to add these columns to every table...or to just have a codeCreatedAuditEntryIdcode and codeModifiedAuditEntryIdcode FKs on the tables you want audited that point to existing separate auditing tables which are used to keep track of all changes.p  pAuditEntry looks likep  ul liIdli liUserIdli liDateTimeli ul  pTheres the obvious performance impact of having to do two joins to get the Created and Modified information...but the benefit is that Im not maintaining state in two difference places, which is like cardinal rule number one in my design book.p  pUPDATEp  pJust to be clear, the AuditEntry table contains every modification to every table, regardless. The question here is whether to utilize that table for Created and Modified information via FKs...or to just add the four columns above to each table I want the information for, so as to avoid the joins.p

Negative 6981 pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comFn5hI.gif althttphome.astound.netpuzzlebloguploadedimagescalculator87355.gifp  pI am creating a calculator for that I have taken the font type as DBLCDTempBlack. It is working properly. In the image digits in a label are running on top of another label, and the bottom label has text 888888888 and so on to get an effect of faded light. So to get this effect, we need to have two labels on top of one another. When I am trying to give 1 continuously to the top label, it is not aligning with the digits which are at the back.p  pDigits 29,0 are generally made up of 8 in this font type so they are aligning. But when I am giving 1, character spacing is getting disturbed.p

Negative 6981 pIm new to jQuery 1.5 months and Ive found myself developing a PHP  jQuery habit that I dont particularly like. Im wondering if anyone has suggestions to make things more elegant. Consider the following HTML that Ive generated by performing a simple SQL query and echoed with PHPp  precodeltdiv idboat1 classboat speedboatgtltdivgt     ltdiv idboat2 classboat dorygtltdivgt ltdiv idcar1 classcar racecargtltdivgt ltdiv idcar2 classcar racecargtltdivgt codepre  pAs you can see, Ive opted for an codeidcode naming convention that follows codetypeidcode. Now, in jQuery, Assume I want to bind a click handler to these emcarem divs. Remembering that they are dynamic and there could be any number of them, Id performp  precode.car.bindclick, function do something  codepre  pBut typically, that codedo somethingcode would like to know which car fired the click event. Furthermore, that codedo somethingcode will probably need to seperate the type boat or car and the codeidcode to perform a POST operation and write back to the database...for examplep  pWhat Im doing now to find the id and other unique information as I need it is simple, but to me, it smellsp  precode.car.bindfunction var id  this.attrid.replacecar,   codepre  pOne might suggest to use the class attribute instead because you dont have to worry about uniqueness. But because class names are not singular there can be more than one per element as Ive shown, I dont see this as a candidate solution.p  pBecause ids must be unique in the entire document, this is the solution Ive settled for. Im aware getElementById would break if multiple ids of the same name were made possible but sometimes I wonder if it would be beneficial if ids didnt have to be unique provided they have different parents.p  pHow do you do it p  pShould I use HTML5s codedatacodep  pThanksp

to put the xerces.jar into the domainlib dir. Then users would not be able to use their own version isnt it like that Well I dont think that putting the jar into the folder is a satifying and clean solution. Are there any other suggestions to solve this kind of problem Or is this problem already solved in newer versions of glassfishp

Negative 6981 pI am learning Objective C and noticed this funky quirk while reading up on methods.p  pLike Java and C, Obj.C can take in multiple parameters, which is fine, however it states that objective C methods can have multiple names which does not seem to register to well with me.p  pFor instancep  precodeNSArray shipsAtPointCGPointbombLocation withDamageBOOLdamaged codepre  pIn the above example, there are two parameters, bombLocation return type CGPoint and damaged return type BOOL and alongside the method name seems to be split as shipsatpointwithDamagep  pI dont understand whats up with this... What does it signify when it states that a method can have multiple names  Is this applicable only for methods that require multiple parameters Alternately, say I want to name my method with a single name but provide it with multiple parameters, is that possible or I must provide it with multiple names each of which correspond to a parameter If yes, then whyp  pThanks for jumping in with my confusion p

Negative 6981 pI face this problem days ago a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq7193520147564linka . In will make this short with easy example. I have Company entity which contain tomany Entity employee and toone Entity CEO which inherited from employee.p  pAfter complete my data model I added 5 employees to this company, the I assign CEO to this company. On testing I called company.employees and expected to get 5 employees, but a result wasnt the same as I expected I also get CEO as one of my employees.p  pShocking from this event I begin searching explanation on apple doc, I see two related article  a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibrarymacdocumentationCocoaConceptualCoreDataArticlescdFetching.htmlapplerefdocuidTP40002484SW1 relnofollowFetching and Entity Inheritancea which sayp  blockquote   pIf you define an entity inheritance hierarchy see Entity   Inheritance, when you specify a superentity as the entity for a   fetch request, the request returns all matching instances of the   superentity and of subentities.p blockquote  pand a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibrarymacdocumentationCocoaConceptualCoreDataArticlescdRelationships.htmlapplerefdocuidTP40001857CJBDBHCB relnofollowRelationship Fundamentalsa sayingp  blockquote   pA relationship specifies the entity, or the parent entity, of the   objects at the destination. This can be the same as the entity at the   source a reflexive relationship. Relationships do not have to be   homogeneous.

Negative 6981 pDo you know of a good solution for dealing with text entries of variable lengths lists with a fixed widthp  pI have an unordered list with a set number of items.  Each item contains a title.  The title can be variable length, not only in number of characters, but also number of characterset korean, japanese, roman, etc..  p  pOne option seems to be cutting the text length down with PHP and adding ... at the end, but since character widths can be variable, the exact cutoff can also be variable. Another would be to make items fixed with and hide overflow, but this seems inelegant because characters might get cutoff right in their centers....p  pDo you know of a good tutorial or solution for something like thisp

With all the HTML its about 200bytes.p  pDeployed it on my server running Jetty 7.5.x jdk 6u27 On my client computer create simple JMeter test plan with Thread Group, HTTP Request, Response Assertion, Summary Report Client also running jdk6u27p  pI set up the thread group to 5 threads running for 60secs and I got 5800 requestssec Then I setup 10 threads and got 6800 requestssecp  pThe moment I disable KeepAlive in JMeter on the HTTP Request sampler. I seem to get lots of big pauses on the client side I suppose, it doesnt seem the server is receiving anything. I get less pauses at 5 threads or barely none but at 10 threads it hangs pretty much all the time.p  pWhat does this mean exactlyp  pKeep in mind Im technically creating a REST service and I was getting the same issue, so I though maybe I was doing something funky in my service, till I figured out its a KeepAlive issue as its doing it pretty much on a staic web app. So in reality I will have 1 client request 1 server response. The client will not be keeping the connection open. p

The scene Im drawing doesnt care which heading the user is facing, the figures will always be drawn a set distance from the viewer.

Negative 6981 pWeve recently came across a problem while migrating our web application from Windows Server 2003 and IIS6 to Windows Server 2008 Standard 32 bit and IIS7.p  pThe web application is a classic ASP application which is using a number of legacy COM components for some database operations. The database server is an Oracle 10g DB running on Linux and the Oracle client is also 10g.p  pThe problem is that when trying to do an insetupdatedelete within a transaction it throws an exception saying that the transaction cannot be enlist in the specified transaction coordinator. Read queries are OK. DML commands are also working fine if the COM components are configured to not require a transaction but thats not really an option for our system. p  pI know the MSDTC is configured correctly and so are the COM components both in terms of security settings and opened portsfirewall turned off completely because on the same server we also have a windows service using the same COM components and that one is working fine. I even went as far as to give rights and permissions to almost every user account on this server for both MSDTC and the COM components so whatever the identity of the thread that is running the code in IIS Id say it should be pretty much covered by that. p  pHave been trying to get to the bottom of this for a few days now and all we could find on the internet were things that we already cover, like DTC configuration and firewall issues. Not sure what else to try particularly since the windows service application is running just fine in the same server setup.p

Negative 6981 pI am starting to migrate a couple of applications to Azure. Seems very straightforward and all I have to do is add an addiitonal Azure project to my solution and point it at my web project.p  pHowever what concerns me is that the team starts contaminating my applications with Azure specific functionality and relying on it. For example File uploads would be to Azure storage, azure caching etc. All well and good if we stay Azure and all clients are happy to use Azure. If we find a client isnt happy with Azure Id like not be into a lot of work removing Azure functionality.p  pJust wondering if anyone had experience similar issues. I guess ideally Id like to be able to have the project right publish to Azure and it uses Azure features, Azure Code etc and a second publish that just allows me to use IIS with non Azure features.p  pI assume I just need to be careful use interfaces correctly and DI etc. FileUpload vs AzureFileUpload. What about issues like resources coming from Azure storage for CSSscripts etc rather than local Should I look at using Azure Cloud Drive to simulate just standard NTFS environmentp  pIs there any advicepatternspractices Has anyone experiences with similar How about separating projects up and project structure etc I guess a lot of is it just standard design.

Negative 6981 pFor some time now Ive been structuring my code around methods with no sideeffects in order to use parallel linq to speed things up. Along the way Ive more than once stumbled on lazy evaluation making things worse instead of better and I would like to know if there are any tools to help with optimizing parallel linq queries. p  pI ask because I recently refactored some embarrassingly parallel code by modifying some methods and peppering codeAsParallelcode in certain key places. The run time went down from 2 minutes to 45 seconds but it was clear from the performance monitor that there were some places where all the cores on the CPU were not being fully utilized. After a few false starts I forced some of the queries to execute by using codeToArraycode and the run time went down even further to 16 seconds. It felt good to reduce the run time of the code but it was also slightly disconcerting because it was not clear where in the code queries needed to be forced with codeToArraycode. Waiting until the last minute for the query to execute was not the optimal strategy but it was not clear at all at what points in the code some of the subqueries needed to be forced in order to utilize all the CPU cores.p  pAs it is I have no idea how to properly pepper codeToArraycode or other methods that force linq computations to execute in order to gain maximum CPU utilization. So are there any general guidelines and tools for optimizing parallel linq queriesp  pHeres a pseudocode samplep  precodevar firstQuery  someDictionary.SelectManyFirstTransformation var secondQuery  firstQuery.SelectSecondTransformation var thirdQuery  secondQuery.SelectThirdTransformation.WhereSomeConditionCheck var finalQuery  thirdQuery.SelectFinalTransformation.Wherex gt x  null codepre  pcodeFirstTransformationcode, codeSecondTransformationcode, codeThirdTransformationcode are all CPU bound and in terms of complexity they are a few 3x3 matrix multiplications and some codeifcode branches. codeSomeConditionCheckcode is pretty much a codenullcode check. codeFinalTransformationcode is the most CPU intensive part of the code because it will perform a whole bunch of lineplane intersections and will check polygon containment for those intersections and then extract the intersection that is closest to a certain point on the line.p  pI have no idea why the places where I put codeAsParallelcode reduced the run time of the code as much as it did. I have now reached a local minimum in terms of run time but I have no idea why. It was just dumb luck that I stumbled on it. In case youre wondering the places to put codeAsParallelcode are the first and last lines. Putting codeAsParallelcode anywhere else will only increase the run time, sometimes by up to 20 seconds. There is also a hidden codeToArraycode hiding in there on the first line.p

Negative 6981 pI am currently using Paypal as a payment system on a website Im working and so far everything works great...except one thing. Once the payment is complete, Paypal calls the IPN page I provided and everythings good. But if the person cancels the payment, Im not sure how Im supposed to know that since Paypal doesnt call the IPN in that case at least, from what I understand. p  pSure, if the person clicks on Cancel and return to the website, he will come back to the Cancel page I provided. But what if he just closes the paypal page He would never return to my websites cancel page. p  pIn some cases, I guess it wouldnt be much of a problem. Im sure there is a way to know if the payment is canceled but I just cant find it, which is why Im here.p  pThanks for your help.p

I told him, since the next will be a NULL, copy that NULL into the data field along with the address to the next node which is also NULL. Then he told me there will be a problem of dangling pointers... which I didnt understand a bit. Can some one please throw light into this problem  Is there a generic solution to this p  pUpdate Two days later  A little bit additional. Considering there is no special node at the end of the list. And the last node points to NULL and if that node is given as input, how to make the before last node point to NULL.

Negative 6981 pIm taking an online class with Googles Apex system, and would like to be able to automatically save the data from certain pages.

When I click the course I want to work on, it opens a new window with the lessons. This is the part I havent been able to do with a program.p  pThe first way I thought of was with PHP, to request the web pages and simply save them. The problem is that there is a login, and a number of javascript events and things that I dont know how to automate with php. I got as far as logging in with a POST request, but couldnt figure the rest out.p  pToday I was trying to do it with Windows Forms, C, using the dotnet WebBrowser control. I have it log in for me and navigate to the page where I need to choose the course to open, but if I click the link, it attempts to open the webpage in Internet Explorer. If I use the link it opens, I get an error from the site. p  pInspecting the link on the page Im having trouble with, I found the javascript event that opens the new window. It opens it with a redirect link. Using this redirect link in a new tab instead of new window works in Chrome, but I dont know how to get the redirect link from C.

With overflowhidden it appears inside of body, but I guess its because its somehow included later, or something.strongp  pEdit2 Found some information about this problem a hrefhttpwww.google.comsupportforumpChromethreadtid6d78452432a4c4d7amphlen relnofollowhttpwww.google.comsupportforumpChromethreadtid6d78452432a4c4d7amphlenap  pa hrefhttpwww.hotscripts.comforumsjavascript53545scriptscausingwhitespacebottomchromesafari.html relnofollowhttpwww.hotscripts.comforumsjavascript53545scriptscausingwhitespacebottomchromesafari.htmlap  pBut still no solution...p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comvzvfP.png altenter image description herep  pUsingp  precodeoverflowhidden codepre  pon the page doesnt improve it, it only makes that no scrollbar appear, but the flashmovie still goes up few pixels.p  pThe CSS of the pagep  precodehtml, body, flashcontent      height 100     width 100     overflow hidden  codepre  pThe HTML Element on the flash app, which contains the iframe with TinyMCE is thisp  precodeltdiv idhtmlel styleposition absolute width 583px height 386px backgroundcolor rgb255, 255, 255 paddingtop 0px paddingright 0px paddingbottom 0px paddingleft 0px margintop 0px marginright 0px marginbottom 0px marginleft 0px bordertopwidth 0px borderrightwidth 0px borderbottomwidth 0px borderleftwidth 0px borderstyle initial bordercolor initial borderimage initial overflowx auto overflowy auto left 854px top 117px gtltdivgt codepre  pAnother detail I know its related to TinyMCE, because when I put only a div over the flash app with the same mechanism one that is even bigger this doesnt happen.

Negative 6981 pWere using MySQL and have an 1.1 million record InnoDB table where the entire table has to be replaced with data from a CSV twice per day.p  pWhat Ive been doing up until now is truncating the table, then using mysqlimport to repopulate the table from the fresh CSV twice a day.  This results in around 160 seconds of downtime, which I was initially told was fine, but that is no longer the case.p  pThe only way I can think of to do this is to have a staging table and a production table.  Live queries will go to production, and when I need to repopulate the db, Ill truncate staging, then mysqlimport the CSV into it, then after that is done I will swap the names so that staging will have the old database and production will contain the freshly imported CSV.  I guess I would need an intermediate name, like production becomes production2, the staging becomes production, and then production2 becomes staging.p  pDoes anyone have an alternate solution  The table needs to be imported as quickly as possible which is why Im using mysqlimport, and the downtime must be extremely minimal.p

Negative 6981 pFirst off let me say this is my first attempt into trying MVP.  I am going for the Passive View approach as I want to completely decouple the Views from the Model.p  pI have read up on MVP by reading the following articles among othersp  pDerek Greerbr a hrefhttpaspiringcraftsman.com20070825interactiveapplicationarchitecture relnofollowhttpaspiringcraftsman.com20070825interactiveapplicationarchitectureap  pTodd Snyderbr a hrefhttpblogs.infragistics.comblogstoddsnyderarchive20071017mvcormvppatternwhatsthedifference.aspx relnofollowhttpblogs.infragistics.comblogstoddsnyderarchive20071017mvcormvppatternwhatsthedifference.aspxap  pMy application is going to have 4 Views that are custom controls in which each implement a different interface to interact with the Presenter.  Now this is not a problem for 3 of the views as the controls are static and never change.  p  pMy problem comes along where on the 4th View I need to change the controlView that is displayed based on events triggered from View 1.p  pSo for example lets say View 1 is a list of people who can be from either an employee or a customer.  Now depending on who is selected you can modify different parameters depending on the type of person selected.  The problem is that View 4 needs to dynamically change the editing control based on what is selected.  Keep in mind not only the properties will be different but how they are edited as well.  Also each editing control is going to fire different events for property changes.p  pSo how does my Presenter know how to manage interaction with the Model, when depending on whether an employee or customer is selected there is a different editor that implements a different View interfacep  pI hope that was clear.  Any help is greatly appreciated.  I have searched all over and all examples show a concrete relationship between the View and Presenter whereas mine needs to be extremely flexible.p  pMy goal here is to keep the editing controls on the 4th View so flexible that I could for example add editing controlsViews for aliens or dogs or whatever else I might add to View1 to be selected.p  pThanksp

Not so applicable for information codepre  pBasically the idea is to insert the draggable view between the nearest UIViews.p  pImagine 1,2,3,4,5 same size views in the screen and try to drag the first let it go between 4,5 and then have 2,3,4,1,5. You get the idea. This all should happen without the help of any new Grid. The only part I need is calculate that you put the 1 UIView between 4,5.p  pI could start calculating frames,origins but this does not sound efficient to me. Any thoughtsp  pThank you. p

Negative 6981 pAs you might heard in the title Im using PHP to add info to a database and then use the info. Its a simple comment system. Im very new to PHP and dont really know if there might be any easier way of creating what Im doing but my problem is still the same. When I get info that is to big for the div to handle in one row if it got no spaces what so ever, it automatically increases the width and height of the div.br At the same time Im having another div that contains the personal info like name and stuff. It is 14 of the width and the commentdiv id 34 as Ive set it with CSS. The infodiv gets smaller as the comment is getting bigger for some insane reason, both in width and height.br When I get the info I get all info from one column and displaying them in a table. I place the comment and the infoinfo in two separate td tags and each cell info in a div with the appropriate width and height height 150px width 2575.  brbrp  pIve already tried to break the line with wordwrap whitespace and overflow but nothing seams to work.p  pI got some idea myself of how it comes the browser shows it like this, since the width and the padding of the divs seam to be matching with the values in the CSS if Id have placed the info in the body and not in the content div. Why it would react like that I have no idea and I want to know if anyone knows what I can do about it... And as said, this only happens when a string is to long. Otherwise its working 100 fine.p  pThankful for any help... and I use PHP, JS, HTML, CSS for the moment and a solution needs to be with ether of the formats I could use like jQuary as well and other lookalikesp

Negative 6981 pMy app needs to get synced with other app users on there own devices. I also want to support offline editing, that are synchronized to the other collaborative users when the user gets connected to the internet.p  pSo the User A changes while he is offline some data in ohter words he would update database entries or add new records to the database. When User A gets connected to the internet, all changes and new records are delivered to the other collaborative Users. So User B will get the changesupdates and can insertupdate them into User Bs local device database.p  pBut I need to ensure that the ids of the database entries are unique along the whole system. Therefore I need to use something like UUID.p  pMy question Is it a bad idea to use a UUID String  Varchar as primary key in a android sqlite database table instead of an integer that would be auto incrementedp  pI guess there would be performance issues by using strings a UUID has 36 characters as primary key.p  pI guess indexing uuids instead of integers takes longer comparing string vs. comparing integers. I also guess that when Im using UUID, every time a new database recordentry has been inserted the database needs to reindex the primary key column, since they primary key index is not in a sorted order anymore which would be when I would use integer auto increment primary key, because every future record is added at the end, because the new auto incremented primary key is always the greatest number so far, so the index will automatically be in sorted order. What i also need to do is JOINS over 2  3 tables. I also guess that comparing strings on JOINS instead of integer would slow down the database query.p  pHowever I cant see any other possibility to implement such a collaborative syncing system, so I must use UUID, rightp  pAnother possibility would be to use a integer auto increment primary key and to use a second column uuid. So to work on the users local device, i would use this primary key integer for JOINS etc., while I would use the uuid column for syncing with the other users.p  pWhat do you guys think about that approach or is it in your opinion to much work, since you wont expect a big significant performance issue by ussing UUID directly as primary keyp  pAny other suggestionsp

Negative 6981 pLately I have been reading lots regarding the OAuth Open Authorization protocol. I have come to understand following points strongOAuth 1.0A strong  It uses digital Signature mitigates the phising and recommends the use of TLSSSL mitigates the maninmiddleattack and practically all those Service Providers using OAuth 1.0A are using TLSSSL. Due to implementation of digital signature and TLSSSL, OAuth 1.0A is more secure, forgiving the hard times of getting digital signature correct. Yet many had implemented OAuth 1.0A the paradox. strongOAuth 2.0strong  This is relatively new, but entirely noncompatible with the earlier one i.e OAuth 1.0 A , does not use digital signature due to the hard times faced in getting it correct 100 instead it uses SSLTLS and bearers token i.e the holder of the token can do anything. Best thing about OAuth 2.0 is that it has differentiated the different grant flows which in OAuth 1.0 is all merged together. And noninteroperability is yet another issue with the OAuth 2.0 i guess it will lead to more division..just my guess. p  pstrongIn many ways I find OAuth 1.0A is better than OAuth 2.0, from what I have learnt so far. Now can anyone shed some light on this, why OAuth 2.0 is encouraged when OAuth 1.0A is better better in the sense that it is more securestrong.p  pThanks.  p

Negative 6981 pI have an interesting scenario in which Ive built a validation checking system that maintains a series of requirements in the form codeListltTupleltFuncltboolgt, stringgtgtcode where the Func should return true if validation failed and false otherwise. The string is a corresponding rejection description that describes the condition should the test fail.p  pIn more simple tests like the following the validation system is quite simplep  precodevalidationChecks.AddTuple.CreateltFuncltboolgt, stringgt gt      value1  requiredValue, value 1 did not have the required value codepre  pIm struggling to understand the scope of variables within the lambda for the Func in a more advanced scenario in which the rejection string is calculated in a call to another part of the system. The scenario looks something like thisp  precodestring rejectionString  null validationChecks.AddTuple.CreateltFuncltboolgt, stringgt gt      rejectionString  CallToAnotherMethodThatReturnsStringparameter     if rejectionString  null          return true      else          return false      , rejectionString codepre  pEDIT As observed through testing, when this check fails the rejectionString from the Tuple is still null. I want the rejectionString that was generated by the CallToAnotherMethod to be used instead, is there any way I can do this using ref or otherwise I need the Funcs code to be able to affect the value of the string inside Item2 of the Tuple.p  pstrikeThe problem is that the code inside of codeCallToAnotherMethodThatReturnsStringcode might be code that I only want executed ONCE.

Negative 6981 pa few questions about windows memory segmentation.p  ol lipevery process in windows got his own virtual memory. does it mean that each  each process has it own task I mean own Task descriptor or Task gate pli lipI opened a simple exe with ollydbg and I saw that for each CALL intruction to a dll  function is taking me to the jumping table. the jumping table had jumping instructions to the DLLs like this one p  pJMP DWORD PTR DS[402058]p  pmy question is why its  uses the data segment and not the CS selector for the base address if I open the memory map and find what stored at 402058 I find  that it containes resorces. if I understand correctly the addresses of the DLL function stored in the DS pli lipI noticed that the memory map is organized by owner. shouldnt it be organized with segments like all  the code be in  CS data in DS etc p  pthank youpli ol
Negative 6981 pProblemp  prun a nontrivial c program stored on the heap or data section of another c program as asm instructions.p  pMy progress p  pRan a set of simple instructions that print something to stdout. The instructions are stored on the heap  and I allowed the page containing the instructions to be executed and then calling into the raw data as though it was a function. This worked fine.p  pNext up, I want given any statically linked c program, to just read its binary and be able to run its main function while it is in memory from another c program.p  pI believe the issues are    jumping to where the main function code is    changing the binary files addresses which were created when linking so they are relative to where the code lies now in memoryp  pPlease let me know if my approach is good or whether I missed something important and what is the best way to go about it.p  pThank youp

Negative 6981 pIn a multithreaded Linux program used for serial communication, is it possible and what would be the best approach to terminate a blocking read call from another threadp  pI would like to keep everything as reactive as possible and avoid any use of timeouts with repeated polling.p  pThe background of this question is that Im trying to create a Scala serial communication library for Linux using JNI. Im trying to keep the native side as simple as possible providing, amongst others, a read and close function. On the Scala side, one thread would call read and block until data from the serial port is available. However, the serial port can be closed by other means, resulting in a call to close. Now, to free up the blocked thread, I would somehow need to cancel the system read call.p

Negative 6981 pI am trying to setupmaintain 3 HDFS Clusters, all using High Availability.  They all work fine on there own, but I want to use HDFS Federation to help them talk to each other.p  pI am using Cloudera 420, and have used their guide to set it all up.  For each cluster, the coresite.xml files are different fs.defaultFS, yet the hdfssite.xml are all the same.  The hdfssite.xml file lists all the nameservices dfs.nameservices, which, of course, reference back to the corresponding coresite.xml.  Each cluster has a slaves file which lists the datanodes that should belong to it.p  pMy trouble is in adding a new datanode.  I set it up with the configuration files core, hdfs, slaves, etc. for the cluster I want it to join.  However, when I start the datanode up, it appears to try to join to the first cluster listed in the dfs.nameservices property.  I would think it would look at the fs.defaultFS property first, but it does not appear to do that.  The wrong cluster seems to accept it as well, despite the new datanode not being in the slaves file.p  pBottom line, my new datanode is trying to join the wrong cluster.  How does it know which one to joinp  pThanks, in advance, for any ideas.p  p UPDATE p  pMaybe I just misunderstand the use case for doing this.  When I look through the Hadoop code, it appears a thread for each dfs.nameservices entry is started.  Each of these tries to assign its CID to a single DataNode object, but only if it is already null.  It appears to do this without regard to order, which means first one wins.  Only if I get lucky will it chose the correct one.  If I am not lucky, which I am usually not, it gets another one... and connects there first.  Strange.p

Negative 6981 pMy requirement is to measure the request and response bandwidth of a webapp thats deployed in Tomcat. Basically capture each request and response bandwidth and store the statistics and do analytics on that data overtime. p  pWeve already written a custom Tomcat Valve to capture plenty of information regarding requests coming to a webapp. Since both request and response go through the Valve, I think there should be a way to capture bandwidth stats in the Valve, but havent found out how to do it.p  pOne thing weve done previously is to get this information using the Tomcat RequestInfo.java class. This however doesnt seem like a clean solution. While digging into the tomcat code, I noticed that we can get the org.apache.coyote.Request object thats used in RequestInfo class as followsp  precodeorg.apache.catalina.connector.request.getCoyoteRequest.getBytesRead  org.apache.catalina.connector.request.getCoyoteRequest.getResponse.getContentWritten codepre  pBut both the above statement always returns 0, which is wrong compared to the output in RequestInfo class.p  pAny idea on what could be the issue Why the coyote.Request is not returning the correct bandwidth in the Valve Is there a better way to capture requestresponse bandwidth, with or without a Valve p

Negative 6981 pI am trying to add a profile management functionality to my Ember application, using codeemberdatacode. For that, my backend  frontend play together in the following wayp  ol liThe backend returns a profile array with several profile objects, with wellknown IDs, for the loggedin user, in a fixed URL codeapiprofilecode. Currently I have a codemecode object settings related to currently logged in user and a codemycompanycode object settings related to the company belonging to the current loggedin user. It is straightforward to add more objects. The objects are not of the same kind, and have different properties. There is only one object of each kind.li liI can view and edit each of the objects using different routercontrollertemplate. Most of the functionality is reusable. For the routers and controllers the only thing I need to adapt is the codeidcode of the object in the profile array, and the route to the edit controller.li ol  pBy using this approach, I can easily add objects to the profile, and add templates to display and edit the properties of each object. The only thing I need to do isp  ol liDefine the model for the new objectli liSetup standard routers and controllers based on the already coded mixinsli liCreate the templatesli ol  pSo this is very easy and flexible, which was my motivation to implement this, but I have one worry. Since I am putting together all properties in the codeProfilecode modelp  precodeApp.User  Ember.Mixin.create     email  DS.attrstring   App.Company  Ember.Mixin.create     vat  DS.attrstring    To do this, the profile model includes the User and Company mixins,    as well as some common properties.  TODO Any other way to do this App.Profile  DS.Model.extendApp.User, App.Company,      name   DS.attrstring,     type   DS.attrstring  codepre  pI am worried that when writing back to the server currently I have only tried with codeFIXTUREScode the properties from the codeCompanycode object will leak to the codeUsercode object, and vice versa.p  pSo, the question is if a model has undefined properties that is, the data coming from the server does emnotem have those properties will those properties be sent back to server with codenullcode value, when serializing the object, or will they not be set at all in the codeJSONcode Mind you that the properties were not there to start with, but the model has all possible properties, for all different profile objects.p  pMaybe there is another way of defining the codeProfilecode model, without including all properties of all different objects I have not been able to do this if a property is not declared in the model, it can not be used in the templatecontroller which is the whole point of defining them in the model, I suppose.p  pI would also like to hear some generic feedback on the chosen approach. I feel I am bending Ember a bit too much by having all this bunch of different objects in a common URL, but I also have the impression that this can reduce the complexity of this part of my application.p  pA demo can be seen a hrefhttpjsbin.comuCUboCo5 relnofollowherea. p

In another question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions18935956usingctointerfacewithalinescancameraat3000hzandprocessdisplayUsing C to interface with a linescan camera at 3000Hz, and process  display the dataa I received great advice as I planned my strategy to attack this.  I now have a specific issue.  Ill reiterate my disclaimer  I am an engineer and not a programmer... but Im learning as I go.p  pIm using a codeQThreadcode to continually acquire data into codeQVectorcode.  I emit the codeQVectorcode to the main GUI thread, which creates a codeQRunnablecode and passes it to a codeQThreadPoolcode to process the block of data.  In this way, I plan to acquire blocks of data and create tasks to process and respond to those blocks in real time.  To simply get all the pieces to function and compile, I originally used a single integer value as the payload.  I can continually generate a random emintem in the codeQThreadcode, emit to the GUI thread, create a codeQRunnablecode and operate on the emintem in the thread pool.  Im proud of that.  However, I cant get it to work with a codeQVectorcode.

Negative 6981 pIs it possible to make a standalone program e.g. in c that is able to send emails without needing to send it to a server In other words you only enter the adresses in the program and its not needed to send them to a server or third party.

Yet can one attach a SMTP to the program, or integrate it in any way  And if you can how do most internet providers handle thesep  pEditp  pI would like to create such a program as a friend who runs a business was talking about him having to trust companies with those adresses.

Negative 6981 pIm trying to implement the Prims algorithm.

Negative 6981 pIm using Spring Tool Suite STS to manage a large Java Spring project. strongIs there a function in STS that allows one to find the declaration of a particular bean by its aliasstrong p  pFor example, if I have the following property in a Java classp  precodeResource private WidgetService widgetService codepre  pI know that this property will be autowired from a Spring bean with the name codewidgetServicecode. The bean injected will be an instance of a class that implements the interface codeWidgetServicecode. The implementations may not be located in the same package as the interface. strongI need a way to quickly determine from that property declaration which implementation will be injected.strongp  pI tried searching for codewidgetServicecode using the Spring Beans Search, but it came up empty. It came up empty because the bean is defined as followsp  precodeltalias aliaswidgetService namedefaultWidgetService gt ltbean iddefaultWidgetService classnamespace.DefaultWidgetServicegt codepre  pTheres the answer to my search codeDefaultWidgetServicecode, but its inside a bean named defaultWidgetService. Since the bean that is used to autowire the codeResourcecode is aliased, the Spring Beans Search doesnt work, as it only has options to search by name, class, etc, but not by alias.p  pI know I can just use a File Search and search for codealiaswidgetServicecode but because of the size of the project searching by text is quite slow. I could also examine the property at debug time and get the class of the injected bean, but that is also cumbersome. Java Search is quick because it is indexed, and Spring Beans Search is quick for the same reason. But I wonder why I am using STS which adds extra time to my builds so STS can index the Spring beans if it wont help me with finding aliased beansp

Negative 6981 pSince a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5575112isthereanapitocancelanautorenewablesubscriptionthere is no API to cancel an autorenewable subscriptiona, how should I implement a multilevel subscription servicep  pFor example if I have Bronze, Silver, and Gold subscription levels, if they are all separate autorenewable subscription services I dont want the user to be subscribed to more than one at once. So if they upgrade or downgrade their plan at any time I want to cancel the other ones. Obviously this type of implementation isnt possible without an API to cancel the subscription... I read that you can have different durations of subscription for the same productid, but I didnt see anything about different service levels and pricing for each level under a single productid. Is there a different mechanism offered by Apple to achieve this type of subscription model that I have missedp

Negative 6981 pAlrighty, so I did some research on constants and how they should be designed and used.

Negative 6981 pI am a beginner user of Sublime Text 2, but I was trying to set up project specific default files to build from. Ill explain myselfp  pWhen writing in LaTeX, I tend to separate the sections or chapters in different .tex files. When I build, I would like the main file to be the one passed to the compiler no matter what file has focus a sectionchapter .tex or the .log file or any other file for that matter.p  pSimilarly, when writing C code, I would like to be able to specify a list of files to pass to the compiler.p  pRight now I am using a copy of the C buildsystem with code.cppcode instead of the current file in the codecmdcode line, but not always I want to build every cpp file in the folder. A similar modification on the LaTeX builder would be possible changing the file to build to something like codemain.texcode and using strongmain.texstrong for the main file every time.p  pEven though these are workarounds, I was wondering if there was a way of defining the default files to the be passed to the compiler or to a batch file if necessary from the project specific files.p

Negative 6981 pSo it seems to me like the most basic of git operations could be done effectively without a remote. ie. You could add and you could commit without a problem.p  pIt seems like the biggest problem with a git repo without a remote would be stuff like codegit resetcode. Like if you want to revert your code to a particular commit twenty commits ago  just to test to see if something worked back then or something  it doesnt seem like you could do it. You do codegit reset hard ...code and then youve lost your twenty newest commits and theres no way to get them back.p  pWhat else wouldnt workp

Negative 6981 pWhat is the standard way to simulate an array in Python  It seems that the list structure only works well when there are no gapsand you just keep appending values. p  pBut suppose you wanted to make a hash table and store the values in an array.  Depending on your hash function, you might need to store the first value value at index 1456.  Would you just start with a list and append 1456 instances of None and then stick in the value  This seems pretty lame and I am wondering if there is a better workaround.  p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 6981 pAfter spending a fair bit of time figuring out that the reason my fragments chosen from a drawer layout werent displaying emsometimesem due to the choreographer skipping frames I was using transaction.replace rather than showhide it made me wonder  what are the situations where one would want to use replace rather than showhide or detachreattach My problem went away when I switched to using showhide btw. p  pTaken from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12201695oncreateviewcalledmultipletimesworkingwithactionbarandfragments titlethisthisa thread I got this on what happens when you call FragmentTransaction.replacep  blockquote   pAndroid will effectively perform a sequence of   FragmentTransaction.remove... for all Fragments currently added to   that container and FragmentTransaction.add... for your supplied   Fragment. Removing a Fragment from the FragmentManager will cause the   Fragment to be destroyed and its state will no longer be managed. Most   noticeably, when you readd the Fragment all of the views will have   been reset. Note since you are reusing the same Fragment instance,   the Fragment will still keep the value any instance variables.p blockquote  pand from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13149446androidfragmentswhentousehideshoworaddremovereplace titlethisthisa thread I got that it is probably better to showhide rather than replace if you plan on using that fragment again. My question is, in which situations do you use FragmentTransaction.Replace The only place I could see it really being useful is for something you know you wont need again, kind of like a dialog picker with options but I use dialog fragments for those situations. p  pDoes anyone use FragmentTransaction.replace regularly, and if so, why did you choose that over another method Cheersp

Negative 6981 pIm creating a QMainWindow with a QMdiArea as the central widget. I have a logoimage I want to put in the center of the QMdiArea which will go over a colored background that I set, but I cant seem to figure out how.p  pSo in the QMdiArea I need to set a background color, put the image on top of that color so that the rest of the background is colored, and center the image horizontally and vertically. So does anyone know how to do this p
Negative 6981 pIm working on CentOS 6.5 64bit.  The program Im running is compiled with GCC G really 4.4.7.  When this is compiled for 32bits, all works fine through this point anyway.  Heres the code which just arranges for a SCSI Write16 commandp  precodevoid Write16BuildCommandUInt32 numSectors, UInt32 bz      buffSize  numSectors  bz     ifpBuff          delete [] reinterpretcastltUInt8gtpBuff         pBuff  NULL           ifpBuff pBuff  new UInt8[buffSize]   Causes SEGV in 64bits     ifpCdb pCdb  new UInt8[cdbLen16]      memsetpCdb, 0, cdbLen16      FillRandompBuff, buffSize       code continues to set LBA and number of sectors  codepre  pWhen execution reaches the line Ive commented above, when compiled for 64bits, I get the segmentation violation.  Write16BuildCommand is called with numSectors  1400 and bz  512 thus buffSize  716800.  Clearly, 716800 bytes is peanuts from the heap this system has 8gb of physical memory.p  pI thought that it might have something to do with user limitations.

However, my max memory is unlimited and so is virtual memory.  At this point, Im stumped and would like a second set of eyes.p  hr  pstrongEDITstrong Ive found the problem with the code.  The issue was with the FillRandom function.  This function used the random library call.  I noticed the return of this function is of type emlong intem.  My fatal assumption was that the long int was always 4 bytes wide.  The filled the incoming array like thisp  precodevoid FillRandomconst void pBuff, UInt32 size       size is in bytes, convert to integer sized quantities     UInt32 numLongIntObjs  size  sizeoflong int  if the area isnt quite divisible, oh well     long int  pTemp  reinterpretcastltlong intgtconstcastltvoidgtpBuff      forUInt32 i  0 i lt numLongIntObjs i          pTemp  random         pTemp       codepre  pWell, originally, the code looked more like thisp  precodevoid FillRandomconst void pBuff, UInt32 size       size is in bytes, convert to integer sized quantities     UInt32 numDwordObjs  size  4   OH NO, not good      long int  pTemp  reinterpretcastltlong intgtconstcastltvoidgtpBuff      forUInt32 i  0 i lt numDwordObjs i          pTemp  random         pTemp       codepre  pRather than answer my own question.  Im going to edit this way and cleanly mark it closed.p  pIncidentally, I inadvertently found this by running the code through valgrind.  Valgrind didnt find the issue.  In fact, Valgrind said it had its own problems and wanted to submit a bug report.  However, one of the statements it made about a bad 4 byte write, long before the code I identified as causing the SEGV, caught my attention and led me here.p  hr  pstrongEDIT 2strong Interesting, closing the question isnt what I thought.  Oh well.  Ill leave this here for a few days, perhaps a week, so that people who hit this on searches will see the resolution.  Then, Ill delete.p

Negative 6981 pI am building a suite of web services that all access the same database but using different credentials. So to modularize the database code I am moving it out of each web app .WAR files and giving the database calls its own .JAR file. So that if WebApp1 and WebApp2 use a getAllColumnsFromTable1 MyBatis call I dont have to define the same mapper and domain object in both projects.  That way I only have to change the MyBatis code in one place if Table1 ever changes, and less copy and paste mistakes. p  pWebApp1 applicationContext.xmlp  precodeltbeans

An example of what I am trying to achieve, is for example call Java methods from NodeJS, while allowing the Java method to manipulate Javascript objects. I know the JSObject class is helpful for this purpose. I have also heard so far of Dnode and ZeroMQ. Have you heard of or do you have experience in doing something similar Would you suggest a way on how this communication Java to NodejS can be donep

Negative 6981 pFor school I am supposed to use recursive backtracking to solve a Boat puzzle. The user inputs a maximum weight for the boat, the amount of item types, and a weight and value for each item type. More than one of each item type can be placed on the boat. p  pOur assignment states The program should find a solution that fills the boat with selected valuable items such that the total value of the items in the boat is maximized while the total weight of the items stays within the weight capacity of the boat.p  pIt also has pretty specific template for the recursive backtracking algorithm.p  pCurrently I am using contiguous lists of items to store the possible items and the items on the boat. The item struct includes int members for weight, value, count of how many times it is used and a unique code for printing purposes. I then have a Boat class which contains data members maxweight, currentweight, valuesum, and members for each of the contiguous lists, and then member functions needed to solve the puzzle. All of my class functions seem to be working perfectly and my recursion is indeed displaying the correct answer given the example input. p  pThe thing I cant figure out is the condition for extra credit, which is, Modify your program so that it displays the best solution, which has the lowest total weight.  If there are two solutions with the same total weight, break the tie by selecting the solution with the least items in it.  Ive looked at it for awhile, but Im just not sure how I can change it make sure the weight is minimized while also maximizing the value. Here is the code for my solutionp  precodebool solveBoat ampboat      if boat.nomore          boat.print         return true          else          int pos         for int i  0 i lt boat.size i             if boat.canplacei                  pos  boat.additemi                 bool solved  solveboat                 boat.removeitempos                 if solved return true                                return false       codepre  pAll functions do pretty much exactly what their name says. No more returns true if none of the possible items will fit on the boat. Size returns the size of the list of possible items. Adding and removing items change the item count data and also the Boat currentweight and valuesum members accordingly. Also the additem, removeitem and canplace parameter is the index of the possible item that is being used. In order to make sure maximized value is found, the list of possible items is sorted in descending order by value in the Boats constructor, which takes a list of possible items as a parameter.p  pAlso here is an example of what input and output look like img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comakhiE.png altinput and output examplep  pAny insight is greatly appreciatedp

Why is it not recognizing the parent as the strongtdstrong element which is much smallerp  pAfter further testing with this...

Negative 6981 pI know, that there are tons of questions regarding leaking Android services and how to maintain a service in an app, but its a bit like seeing two doctors with one problem you get three different opinions...p  pIn other words I am completely unsure, how to deal with my service in a proper way. Hence this question.p  pI have the following Several codeActivitiescode and a codeBoundServicecode, which is started on app startup and should be kept alive until the app closes.p  pAndroid.delevoper proposes to use a bound service to ease communication between codeServicecode and codeActivitycode. So I bind my service in each activities codeonStartcode and unbind it in every codeonStopcode to keep it from leaking.p  pIn addition, I read in several threads, that one should use startService to keep the service from being destroyed when no Activity is binding to it anymore. So I use an explicit codestartServicecode in my first codeActivitycode and a codestopServicecode on every exit point of my app.p  pSo basically I have this as my codeServicecodep  precodepublic class NetworkService extends Service      private final IBinder binder  new ServiceBinder      Override     public void onCreate            Override     public IBinder onBindIntent intent          return binder           public class ServiceBinder extends Binder          public NetworkService getService              return NetworkService.this                codepre  pAnd then a starting Activity like thisp  precodepublic class ActFirstActivity extends Activity      private NetworkService      networkService     private boolean             networkServiceIsBound    false      Override     protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState          super.onCreatesavedInstanceState         setContentViewR.layout.act1           Override     protected void onStart          super.onStart          Intent serviceIntent  new Intentthis, NetworkService.class         startServiceserviceIntent         bindServiceserviceIntent, networkServiceConnection, Context.BINDAUTOCREATE           Override     protected void onStop          super.onStop         unbindServicenetworkServiceConnection           private ServiceConnection networkServiceConnection  new ServiceConnection          Override         public void onServiceConnectedComponentName className, IBinder service              ServiceBinder binder  ServiceBinder service             networkService  binder.getService             networkServiceIsBound  true                   Override         public void onServiceDisconnectedComponentName componentName              networkServiceIsBound  false                codepre  pEvery other codeActivitycode would have the same bindunbind functionality and the same codeServiceConnectioncode. As far as I can see, this keeps my app from leaking a service connection. But I have the impression that I introduced a LOT of overhead here.

Instead of showing the Add button Ive created in each sections footer, I see the add button for section 0 showing at the bottom of the table view, underneath section 1. p  pIt seems like doing something to force a refresh of the table seems to fix the problem. This UITableViewController is the top controller in a UINavigationController, and if I select a table cell a new view controller is pushed onto the navigation controller. Navigating back to the original table view controller, the footer buttons are displayed in the correct place.p  pThe easiest way to make this work is just to use codereloadDatacode instead of codeinsertRowsAtIndexPathscode. But Id like to know what Im doing wrong here so that I can avoid reloading all table data if possible.p  pAm I using the codeinsertRowsAtIndexPathscode incorrectly herep

Negative 6981 pIm looking to optimize the PHP side of an app I have.

Negative 6981 pAll.p  pI am building an Angular app where you can choose whether to select the time of day in 5, 7.5, 10 or 15 minute intervals. Because this is utilising select dropdowns, if the interval is set smaller than 15 minutes, it creates many, many options. What I want to do is to select the time in 15 minute increments and then use fine tuning up and down buttons to increment the time selection by the selected interval.p  pSo far I have added the buttons and they work fine. All I need to do now is to filter the selection list so it will only display values that are in 15 minute blocks, i.e. 1200, 1215, 1230, 1245.p  pI should add that if the interval is set to 7.5 minute blocks, the time is formatted as such 120730p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.p  pThank you.p

Negative 6981 pIm going through a surge of interest in C99s variablymodified type system. This question was inspired by a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions28589518whatmethodsignaturewouldimakeforthisfunctionthis onea.p  pChecking the code from this question, I discovered something interesting. Consider this codep  precodeint myFuncint, int, int, int[][100]  int myFuncint a, int b, int c, int d[][200]       Some code here...   codepre  pThis obviously wont and does not compile. However, this codep  precodeint myFuncint, int, int, int[][100]  int myFuncint a, int b, int c, int d[][c]       Some code here...   codepre  pcompiles without even a warning on gcc.p  pThat seems to imply that a variablymodified array type is compatible with any nonvariablymodified array typep  pBut thats not all. Youd expect a variablymodified type to at least bother with which variable is used to set its size. But it doesnt seem to do sop  precodeint myFuncint, int b, int, int[][b]  int myFuncint a, int b, int c, int d[][c]      return 0  codepre  pAlso compiles without any error.p  pSo, my question is is this correct standardized behaviourp  pAlso, if a variablymodified array type would really be compatible with any array that has the same dimensions, wouldnt this mean nasty security problems For example, consider the following codep  precodeint myFuncint a, int b, int c, int d[][c]      printfdn, sizeofd  sizeofd[0]     return 0   int main     int arr[10]  0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9     myFunc0, 0, 100, amparr      return 0  codepre  pCompiles and outputs 100, no errors or warnings, nothing. As I see it, that means easy outofbounds array write even if you are strictly checking the size of your array via codesizeofcode, emnot doing a single castem and even have all warnings turned on Or am I missing somethingp

Negative 6981 pIm using a QLineEdit field within a touchcontrolled environment, thats why my question is a bit strange. There is a situation where a user may have typed some illegal data into the QLineEdit input field and should not be allowed to leave this input field until the illegal input has been corrected.p  pNow when I check the focuslostevent for the QLineEdit, it is too late. This event is sent when e.g. an other button is clicked but this button is already processed at this point, and the probably wrong data in my input field are used.p  pSo how can I solve this Is there a possibility to lock the focus on an element so that all other widgets cant be used until this lock is released disabling all the other widgets is NOT a solutionp  pOr is there some kind of prefocusevent where I can inhibit the event to the other widget and keep my input field active and focused exclusivelyp  pThanksp

Negative 6981 pMy first post so please have mercy andor kind suggestions. p  pI have a web application Sitefinity CMS 3.7SP4 running in c .net 4.0 on IIS running on Server 2012. For the longest time, a single snippet of the code from Twitter displayed with no problems. Then on its own, the code snippet appears not to turn the twitter link into the twitter feed. p  pBy default, the twitter code snippet shows a shortcut to the twitter account. Upon the javascript running sourced from twitter, so no code maintain the feed displays the posts by latest. p  pThis stopped working a few weeks ago on its own. Not sure what it is as nothing appears to show up in the console no errors, just a message navigation occured. Also, the twitter displays in all other browsers. p  pIll post my findings, but curious is anyone else had this happen recently and what was their findings. p  pThanksp
Negative 6981 pIm working on parsing a file and inserting it into a database, using sqlalchemy core. I had it set up with the orm originally but that doesnt meet the speed requirements for the project.p  pMy database has 2 tables Objects and Attributes. The Objects table has a primary key of objid. The primary key for Attributes is composite attrname, attrclass, and objid, which is also a foreign key from Objects.p  pThe attributes are stored after parsing the file in a list of dictionaries, like sop  precode[  objid  objid, attrname  name, attrclass  class, etc...,  ETC ETC ETC] codepre  pThe data is being inserted by first bulk inserting the objects, then the attributes. The object insert works perfectly. When inserting the attributes however, I get an integrity error, saying I tried to insert a duplicate primary key.p  pHere is my insert code for attributesp  precodeself.engine.execute             Attributes.table.insert,                 [objid  attr[objid],                   attrname  attr[attrname],                   attrclass attr[attrclass],                   attrtype  attr[attrtype],                   attrsize  attr[attrsize] for attr in attrList] codepre  pWhile trying to work this error out, I printed the id, name, and class of each attribute in the list to a file to find the duplicate key. Nowhere in the list is there actually an identical primary key, so this leads me to believe it is a problem with the structure of my query.p  pCan anyone figure this out with the info Ive given, or give me somewhere to look for more information Ive already checked the documentation pretty thoroughly and couldnt find anything helpful.p  h2strongEditstrongh2  pI also tried executing each insert statement separately, as suggested by someone on sqlalchemys google group. The results were the same. The code I usedp  precodeinsert  Attributes.table.insert  for attr in attrList      stmt  insert.valuesobjid  attr[objid], ...      self.engine.executestmt  codepre  pwhere ... was the rest of the values. p  h2strongEdit 2strongh2  pThe Integrity error is thrown as soon as I try to insert an attribute with the same nameclass but a different object id. So for examplep  pIn the format nameclassidp  pBy iteration 4, Ive gotp  ul liAttr1Class10li liAttr2Class20li liAttr3Class30li liAttr4Class40li ul  pOn the next iteration, I try to insert Attr1Class11, which fails.p

Negative 6981 pThis is a google flash to html5 banner question.p  pWhen shoving in SWF files to googles Swiffy, it tells me my filesize is e.g. 40kb, but then when i download the gzip file and open it the html file becomes 160kb, and there looks like theres a runtime.js file which is 420kb.

Negative 6981 pI have an application with two UIWindows. The second of these two windows is used to allow a banner to slide down over the iOS status bar whenever a push notification is received. The problem is that I want the first window to determine whether or not the status bar is hidden or visible rather than the banner window dictating that because for different view controllers and different orientations the status bars visibility varies. p  pIve tried a lot of different things, but I havent been successful yet. Ive tried setting the prefersStatusBarHidden method of the banner window to return the isStatusBarHidden property of the other window, but on rotation it seems to get the property before the rotation and the nonbanner window lays itself out as if the statusBarHidden property were still whatever it was in the orientation the device was rotated from. This results in there sometimes being an extra 20 points of space at the top of the view when the status bar isnt visible or alternatively, the view wont leave the 20 points of space for the status bar and then the status bar will overlap with the content at the top of the view.p  pAny advice on how to address this issue would be much appreciated.p

Negative 6981 pI am new to Stack Overflow and to both pygame and python in general, so please forgive me if I made a very simple mistake. I am trying to display text one character at a time in a pygame screen. My function works fine, rendering what I want it to, except that it randomly freezes, displaying Not Responding in the caption area, at inconsistent times e.g. sometimes it will freeze after rendering 10 letters, sometimes after 28, etc. This happens even after I restart my computer. My question is Is this just happening to me, or is it something wrong with my code, and if it is something wrong with my code, please help me fix it.

Negative 6981 pIm trying to build a webpage that contains an iFrame. When I click on a link within the iFrame, my parent page gets redirected to the link I just clicked on. However, what I want is for the new page to also be in the iFrame.p  pFor example, suppose I have google.com in my iFrame. When I click on the images hyperlink to get to google images, my entire webpage gets redirected to google images. What I want is for my webpages URL to remain unfazed, but for the content of the iFrame to change from Google to Google Images.p  pIve tried adding base target  framename but that hasnt helped. p  pInterestingly, the behavior I get depends on the website Im on. When I have w3schools.com in my iFrame, clicking on a link redirects my entire page to that link. When Im on weather.gov, clicking on a link only changes the contents of my iFrame. p

Negative 6981 pI have a performance issue drawing a usercontrol in WPF. Here is what I do.  Basically the application plays an audio file. The class playing the audio file sends information about its position every few times a second. p  pI have a Usercontrol that renders the position of the file. I do it like thisp  precode    protected override void OnRenderDrawingContext drawingContext                lots of drawing happens here like drawingContext.DrawRectangle,          drawingContext.DrawLine ....          base.OnRenderdrawingContext      codepre  pNow I have another thread in the application that does some processing basically reading audio data and sends information to the usercontrol afew times every second via delegate. The second process declares a delegate like thisp  precode    protected virtual void OnBytesPlayedBytesPlayedEventArgs e               if playheadCallback  null             playheadCallbackfileStream.CurrentTime.TotalSeconds, fileStream.TotalTime.TotalSeconds       codepre  pthe usercontrol registered to that event and redraws itself as suchp  precode    public void PlayheadPositionUpdatedouble currentFrame, double allFrames               Application.Current.Dispatcher.BeginInvoke            DispatcherPriority.Background,            new System.Action gt                            this.InvalidateVisual                  codepre  pThis all works, however once I enable the callback and it draws the usercontrol a few times every second everything becomes sluggish and performance goes down. So I guess the way I handle the drawing or redrawing is not efficient. Can someone point me in the right direction how to redraw the usercontrol so it does not impact the playback performance or the overall performance of the application p  pPlease let me know if I need to explain more or provide more code. I wanted to keep it as simple as possible to outline the problem.p  pthank you.p  pEdit p  pThe code that calls NAudio isp  precode            var inputStream  new AudioFileReaderfilename              fileStream  inputStream              var aggregator  new SampleAggregatorinputStream              aggregator.NotificationCount  inputStream.WaveFormat.SampleRate              aggregator.BytesPLayed  s, a gt OnBytesPlayeda              playbackDevice.Initaggregator codepre

The variable pgbrkAll is incrementing the location in the summary workbook however it keeps overwriting data on the summary workbook and jumping back to a smaller value and I am not sure why Thank you in advance for any help.p  precode    Open two workbooks     Workbooks.Open myfile1     Workbooks.Open myfile2     Dim pgBreak As Variant     Dim pgBreak2 As Variant     Dim myVar As Variant     Dim pgbrk1 As Integer     Dim pgbrk2 As Integer     Dim SourceRange As Range     Dim pgbrkAll As Integer increments summary workbook     Dim rowDiff As Integer     Dim rowDiff2 As Integer     Dim matchVar As String variable to search for in other file     Dim matchVar2 As String variable to match from original file      pgbrk1  1     pgbrk2  1     pgbrkAll  1     Workbooks.Add create a summary worksheet   For Each pgBreak In Workbooksfile1name.WorksheetsSheet1.HPageBreaks  Set variable to the first value after the page break eventually change this to set variable to first used cell after page break  matchVar  Workbooksfile1name.WorksheetsSheet1.RangeB amp pgbrk1  1.Value      Set SourceRange  Workbooksfile1name.WorksheetsSheet1.RangeA amp pgbrk1, K amp pgBreak.Location.Row  1     SourceRange.Copy     ActiveSheet.RangeA amp pgbrkAll.PasteSpecial     rowDiff  pgBreak.Location.Row  pgbrk1     pgbrk1  pgBreak.Location.Row     pgbrkAll  pgbrkAll  rowDiff  1      For Each pgBreak2 In Workbooksfile2name.WorksheetsSheet1.HPageBreaks      matchVar2  Workbooksfile2name.WorksheetsSheet1.RangeA amp pgBreak2.Location.Row.Value             If matchVar  matchVar2 Then                 Set SourceRange  Workbooksfile2name.WorksheetsSheet1.RangeA amp pgBreak2.Location.Row, K amp pgBreak2.Location.Row  rowDiff2                SourceRange.Copy                ActiveSheet.RangeA amp pgbrkAll.PasteSpecial                rowDiff2  pgBreak2.Location.Row  pgbrk2  1                pgbrk2  pgBreak2.Location.Row                pgbrkAll  pgbrkAll  rowDiff2  1             Else              rowDiff2  pgBreak2.Location.Row  pgbrk2  1             pgbrk2  pgBreak2.Location.Row             pgbrkAll  pgbrkAll          End If     Next     Next codepre

Negative 6981 pI have used Eclipse for Java for the last few years and am trying out Intellij. Im not using it permanently because it isnt as useful for quick programming like how you cant just drag in files into the src folder but for doing certain things, I think it will be faster for me.p  pI know there is CtrlShiftEnter, but this is just annoying to press. Not because it is awkward to press, but because it takes so much time compared to just pressing enter like you can in Eclipse. I tried to rebind it to enter, but then it just doesnt work.p  pIs there a way to set up the Complete Current Statement so that it happens when I press enterp  pLike, is there a way that I can bind it to Enter, but have it checked before the editor checks for enter as move to next linep
Negative 6981 pI am writing a method that will take a large list of files and split them into smaller lists that contain an equal total of disk space. Eg. a list with 1 file that is 100kb and another with 100 files that are 1kb each. p  pThe code i have does the following. If all files in a list total to more than 500kb i want to split this list into smaller lists. This means if i have a total count of 600kb i will have 2 lists. I want to add 300kb or as close as possible worth of files to each of these lists. p  pI have code written that will do this fairly well, but there is a common type of scenario that will mess this up. If i have 99 files. 99 are 1kb each and the last file is 400kb. This code will go back and forth adding 1 file to each lists until both lists will have 49 files with 49kb in each of the lists, but now the final file which is huge will mean that 1 list will be 49kb and the other 449kb. I need a smart way to divide the files so that the 400kb file ends up in a list on its own. p  precodeint listcount  intMath.Ceilingtotalsize  listlimit 500kb      Listltstringgt[] lists  new Listltstringgt[listcount]     double[] memorytotals  new double[listcount]  this array will keep track of what the file size total is in each of the arrays.      foreachstring file in filelist              double size  new FileInfofile.Length          int pos  0         for int i  0 i lt memorytotals.Length i              if memorytotals[i] lt memorytotals[pos]  pos  i              ifsize gt memorytotals[pos]                      get the next smallest array that is not pos             int pos2  0             for int i  0 i lt memorytotals.Length i                              if memorytotals[i] lt memorytotals[pos2] ampamp pos2  pos                                        pos2  i                                             if moving all contents of the smallest array into the second smallest array make for a smaller size than just putting the larger file directly into the smaller array than do it.             double newlistTotal  memorytotals[pos]  memorytotals[pos2]             ifnewlistTotal lt size                              lists[pos2].AddRangelists[pos]                 empty the list in order to add the new larger file to this list.                 lists[pos].Clear                               lists[pos].Addfile      codepre

Negative 6981 pI have created a C class to wrap a hugeunreadable fortran code. This code does not contain common blocks or modules, but it has some save statements and equivalence statements. The idea is that the class contains members that are sent to these fortran routines to store temporary results.p  pI have tested this C class with singlethreaded MPI processes and it works nicely. But if I try a OpenMP parallelization, it looks like inside the fortran code, threads start to tamper with each others variables, especially inside loops. The way I have implemented the parallel part, is that I have created an vector of objects so each thread uses its own object from that vector.p  pI have spent some time reading on the net and it seems that defining the fortran functionssubroutines as recursive could help. I have done so, but I still get the error Fortran runtime error Loop variable has been modified.p  pHere is a simplified version of the wrapperp  precodeint nthreads  16 vectorltcltegt lte lte.resizenthreads forauto ampitlte it  new clteinput  pragma omp parallel defaultshared privatexx,yy,tt,tid,ele,ele1,ele2,ele3,kk numthreadsnthreads      tid  ompgetthreadnum   fortt  0 tt lt nt tt     foryy  0 yylt ny yy pragma omp for scheduledynamic,2       forxx  0 xx lt nx xx            Compute array offsets           ele   ttnynxnw4  yynxnw4  xxnw4          ele1  ttnynxndep  yynxndep  xxndep          ele2  tidndep          ele3  ttnynx6ndep4nw  yynx6ndepnw4  xx6ndepnw4             synthesize spectra and gradient          synthOneGradlte[tid], nw, ndep, m[tid], dpar,  ampres[ele], ampgrad[ele3]     xx    yy    tt   pragma codepre  pInside synthOneGrad, each thread will call a method lteeos, that calls the fortran functions.p  pIs there a way to force each openMP thread to use their own private memory inside the fortran routines.

Negative 6981 pI am writing a bot using Python with Selenium module.When I open a webpage with my bot, since the webpage contains too many external sources than dom, it takes a lot to get all of the page loaded.

The problem is If i run the following statementp  precodedriver  webdriver.Firefox driver.getsomewebpage elm  WebDriverWaitdriver, 5.untilExpectedConditions.presenceofelementlocatedBy.ID, someelementID   elm.click codepre  pIt doesnt work since the Selenium waits for the driver.get to fully retrieve the webpage and then, it proceeds further.

Negative 6981 pIm looking for some guidance around publishing my application so that customers can find and install it. For my scenario, I suspect the Office App Store may not be the right way to gop  pMy application will run on our onprem infrastructure, and needs to reach out at regular intervals to a number of o365 customers to perform an Azure AD query. Thats it  no UI, no enduser sign on required  just the Azure AD query.p  pIve built the application as a Service application using a certificate to authenticate, as described here a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenusofficeoffice365howtobuildingserviceappsinoffice365 relnofollowhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenusofficeoffice365howtobuildingserviceappsinoffice365a. I created a web page to allow the customer to grant consent, and a console app that polls their Azure AD. All works like a dream against our own o365 tenant, where Im in control of creating the application definition, editing the json manifest to include the cert details etc.p  pSo the question is, what would be the best practice for getting this application to our o365 customers The application will only be relevant to customers who subscribe to one of our other nono365 products, so the app store doesnt feel right i.e. its not a selfcontained app that just anyone can buy.p  pIs there a bestpractice way we can package the application definition and custom manifest and give this to customers outside of the app storep  pAnd how would the packaging side of things actually work, given there is no Visual Studio template for this kind of service app VS only caters for addins from what I can make outp

Negative 6981 pI am attempting to build a dataset from unstructured data.

This whole operation is falling apart on the basis of a seemingly simple problem  p  pI need to append rows to my data where some of the elements do not exist.p  pThe raw data is like sop  precodejsn1 lt listidid1, col11, col2A, col311 jsn2 lt listidid2, col12, col2B, col312 jsn3 lt listidid3, col2C, col313 jsn4 lt listidid4, col13, col314 codepre  pThe structure I am trying to get to is thisp  precodedf lt data.frameidcid1,id2,id3,id4,                  col1c1,2,NA,4,                  col2cA,B,C,NA,                  col3c11,12,13,14  gt df    id col1 col2 col3 1 id1    1    A   11 2 id2    2    B   12 3 id3   NA    C   13 4 id4    4 ltNAgt   14 codepre  pMy approach is along the lines ofp  precodeCollect the json names in a vector filescjsn1,jsn2,jsn3,jsn4  Initialize the dataframe with the first row filling in any missing values.   I didnt do this at first, but it seems helpful. df1data.frameidjsn1id,      col1jsn1col1,      col2jsn1col2,      col3jsn1col3,      stringsAsFactorsF  Create a loop to loop through the files extracting the values then add them to a dataframe. for i in 2lengthfiles      a lt getfiles[i]     new.row lt listidaid,               col1acol1,               col2acol2,               col3acol3      df1 lt rbinddf1,b  codepre  pHowever, this doesnt work because codedf1 lt rbinddf1,new.rowcode requires the columns to be the same length.

And read a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions22045681addingrowtoadataframewithmissingvaluesthisa and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions23156819raddacolumnwithmissingvaluestoadataframethisa among others.p  pMost answers can add to the data frame by knowing a priori what columns will be null not null.  Then constructing a df without those columns and adding it with fill.  This wont work as I have no idea what columns will be present ahead of time.  The missing ones currently end up with 0 elements which is the root of the problem, but I need to check if they are present.  It seems like there should be an easy way to handle this either on read or on the rbind, but I cant seem to figure it out.p  pThere are potentially hundreds of columns and millions of rows though 10s and 100s right now.  The jsons are large so reading them all into memory  contacting the lists somehow is probably not possible with the real data. A solution using data.table would probably be ideal.  But any help is appreciated.  Thanks.p

The model doesnt know yet which types it should hold, because in the future it should be possible to add more pet types on the fly. So, the idea is to pass to the directive an codengmodeluser.petscode, and the directive should be smart enough to take the pet types passed by parameter codedatatypescode, and create one input per type, that was linked to each attribute inside codeuser.petscode. p  pYou may have already noticed the codewhat should go herecode in the template. Now, according to that, and provided I pass a codemymodelcode to the uncompiled directive with an object, and knowing that this object should contain as keys the pet types, and as values the user input per each pet type, how should I do so I tried this one codengmodelmyModel.petcode, but it complains about a codecode here, so I guess I cant generate model names on the fly.p
Negative 6981 pI am trying to remove rows based on whether or not columns 2 and 3 contain 0s. I keep getting very strange results. I tried to write it without codesubsetcode initially because I read somewhere that codesubsetcode should only be used for small amounts of data because of the memory cost. Neither attempt worked for me however.
