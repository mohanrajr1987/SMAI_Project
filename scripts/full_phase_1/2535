Positive 2535 pI have a simple web app in ASP.NET MVC which uses Sql CE for the backend database, using EF. Everything works fine, except that Id like to keep a log of impressions for users hitting an api in the app I get enough requests that it crashes the server. Ive tried a couple options which do not perform well enough and I had to disable them. Im keying off a user id in the database which has a unique index on it. p  pin all cases, if the member doesnt exist in the db, a new record is created and saved. p  ul lipin v1, look up member in db, increment an impression counter, save the record back. This was way too slow and crashed the server. pli lipin v2, I simply checked if the record existed and create it. if it exists, I do nothing. This is still too slow, but faster than v1. pli ul  pIm looking into keeping an inmemory db for this next, and store it out to sql ce occasionally. My concern is, will this still not work if I store up 1000 items in a few seconds, and then try to store them in a single update  It feels like sql ce may just not be capable of doing what I need at all, or am I overlooking some simple performance optimization p

Positive 2535 pAssumed this would be a duplicate many times over, but I couldnt find anything doing quite what Im trying to do, so...p  pWithout too much detail, I have a set of web applications that work together, and share some databases...meaning each application has its own backend SQL database, however there are use cases where other applications in the system need access to data in another database.  Also, depending on how this system is installed, the physical locations of the web applications ASP.NET MVC can vary...for example, they may all be on a single machine, meaning all web applications have direct access to all databases, or in physically different placesnetworks...meaning we need a web interfaceservice odata v4 for some calls in some situations.p  pSo far, Ive handled this pretty well by developing the web applications completely decoupled from the underlying source.  Meaning, direct connections typically via EF6, though some direct ADO calls are in use too and web service calls oData v4 can be used interchangably, literally with the switch of a boolean value.  This is done via an independent interface library...so the controllerview levels of the web applications work with nothing but interfaces...both at the DBContextOdata client context level, and at the individual entity model level.  p  pNow, this all works great...however one aspect Im completely missing is the navigation properties of the models, which in some cases would be very helpful.  I have had virtually no luck trying to implement a generic interface for these objects in both 1n and nn scenarios, and Im thinking hoping that somebody has figured this out previously  It seems like somethign that would be fairly common, but perhaps not.  p  pIdeally, a navigation property, such as a set of say, Employees in a particular Company, could be accessed via an interface, such asp  precodeinterface ICompany       or IQueryableltgt, or Listltgt, etc    IEnumerableltIEmployeegt  Employees  get       other properties here...etc  codepre  pThis way, I could use this common interface interchangably, regardless of the datasource both the EFgenerated data models Company and Employee, and the Odata client generated models with the same name, both implement ICompany and IEmployee respectively.p  pIm not sure if this could be done is such a way that the underlying concrete types can work asis, or if Id have to do some manual coding for these types...such as writing a .Expand statement for the odata model manually and returning that, but either way would be acceptable.p  pThe only way Ive found is to add my own differentlynamed, obviously property to the interface, and manually add code to each concrete type via partial class definitions...but ideally Id like to have a cleaner solution, hopefully one that doesnt require additional properties that dont actually map to any entity in the database.p

The MSSQL database has primary keys defined as Identity and thus they are also defined as such in the EF model.p  pToday we have a manually maintained file that fixes the configuration when using Oracle such that we change the databasegenerated option.

Positive 2535 pI define a one to many relationship. A customer can have many orders but an order can belong to only one customer. An order can have many itemcodes but an item code can only belong to one order. An order has a required field codeDateCreatedcode. And an Item with itemcode has a required field, codeItemNamecode. From a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq25576459807223HEREa I understand the use of custom validators in breeze.p  pBut say I create a customer entity with multiple orders. I then add another order with a null codeDateCreatedcode field, thus making this entity invalid. If i try to validate the customer entity using codecustomer.entityAspect.validateEntitycode, should breeze be able to validate each item in the orders and result that the customer entity is invalid because it has an order with no codeDateCreatedcodep  pSimilarly if I add an item to an order with no codeItemNamecode, will breeze still determine that the customer is invalid because it contains an order with one item lacking an item name That is, will breeze validate any depth of nested relationshipsp  pI have been trying this for a while but to no avail. Collections defined in EF are not just validated when I use codeentity.entityAspect.validateEntitycode, but the validation fails when I try saving. If I try validating the order entity itself order.entityAspect.validateEntity or the Item Entity itself codeitem.entityAspect.validateEntitycode, the validation works fine. I just does not when I try validating the parent entity customercodecustomer.entityAspect.validateEntitycode. I am wondering if this is normal or I am doing something wrong. Should this validation be handled using custom validatorsp

I cant catch anything by model modification like dates out of range, missing relationships and other stuff.p  pWhat I really need is a try..catch for every row or an event on row reading failure, something like this.p

Positive 2535 pIm using the Entity Framework 6, database first Im new to EF. I have two entity classes, codeStructurecode and codeContourcode, where a codeStructurecode may contain multiple objects of type codeContourcode.

For example, if I add a new codeContourcode to an existing codeStructurecode object like thisp  precodeContour contour  new Contour      Structure  structure,  codepre  pI can delete it like thisp  precodecontour.Structure  null codepre  pBut if the contour already exists in the database and I delete it, saving the entity context throws the exception The relationship could not be changed because one or more of the foreignkey properties is nonnullable...p  pThat exception tells me that the entity context wasnt aware that its supposed to delete that codeContourcode. My fix was to delete a codeContourcode as followsp  precodecontour.Structure  null EntityContext.Contours.Removecontour codepre  pBut if the contour doesnt exist in the database already because it was just added, then the entity context is not aware of it and it doesnt find it in its codeContourscode list. So then I modified my delete method to thisp  precodecontour.Structure  null if EntityContext.Contours.Local.Containscontour      EntityContext.Contours.Removecontour  codepre  pThis appears to work so far, but is this how Im supposed to delete entity objects that may or may not already exist in the databasep

It returns all rows from the codeRankingcode table that are linked to the codeWebsitecode entity. It does not filter to return only the first row. In the same way, accessing codecompany1.Employeescode to call the codeAddcode method will load all employees related to codecompany1code because codeWebsite.Rankingscode is of type codeICollectionltgtcode and not codeIQueryableltgtcode.p  pLazy loading is completely unrelated. Lazy loading simply means that the collection is not loaded until the code references this collection or any other property that refers to data from a related table. But once the code references this collection, all related entities are loaded.p  pI would love someone to show me how this is untrue or how to prevent this. So far, the only people who are saying it is untrue are not willing to back it up andor just insult me when I asked them to back up their claims. Not understanding how this works can lead to major performance problems.p

Positive 2535 pI understand that DropCreateDatabaseIfModelChanges will trigger the rebuild of my database when the model changes.  And this is what Ive experienced for the last two weeks Ive been working on this project.  I change the model, delete the MDF, and rerun the project.  When I forget to delete the MDF, upon accessing the controller, the exception reminds me that the entity framework cannot recreate the database since it already exists.  This reminds me to delete the MDF, and all is well again.p  pAt some point today, things changed.  Now, it attempts to recreate the database every time I run the project.br Heres what Ive done to validate Im having a new problem...p  pI delete the MDF to start fresh. Run the project, hit the controller, which creates the MDF, then stop the project.br I then immediate run the project again... no code changes whatsoever. I get the Additional information Cannot create file ....mdf because it already exists. Change the file path or the file name, and retry the operation. removed the actual mdf file name here for brevity.p  pI dont understand why it keeps trying to recreate the DB even when no model changes have occurred.  Any ideas whats going on  Ive restarted VS and Windows, but to no avail.  Id sure appreciate any ideassuggestions on what to check next.p

Yet when I debug the original project, I see img srchttpi30.tinypic.comega874.png altscreenshot of problem p  pThe immediate window tells me the if is false, yet the code falls into the conditional.p  pAt any rate, the best answer, I think, is to prepare for floating point arithmetic in these situations.

Negative 2535 pI have recently just started working with Lucene specifically, Lucene.Net and have successfully created several indicies and have no problem with any of them.  Previously having worked with Endeca, I find that Lucene is lightweight, powerful, and has a much lower learning curve due mostly to a concise API.p  pHowever, I have one specific indexquery situation which I am having problems wrapping my head around.  What I have is a person directory.  People can be searched for in this application, with the goal of returning both exact and approximate matches.  Right now, in the index I concatenate the FirstName and LastName into a single field called FullName, adding a space between the two.  So FirstNameJon with LastNameSmith yield FullNameJon Smith.  I do anticipate the possibility of middle names and possibly suffix, but that is not important at the moment.p  pI would like to do the equivalent of a fuzzy search on the name, so someone searching for John Smith would still get back Jon Smith.  I had thought about a multisearch, however, this becomes more involved if his name was actually Jon Del Carmen or Jon Paul Del Carmen.  I have nothing in what the user types in to delineate the first name or last name pieces.p  pThe only thought that I have is that I could replace spaces in the concatenated value with a character that would not be discarded.  If I did this when I built the document for the index and also when I parsed the query, I could treat it as one larger word, right  Is there another way to do this that would work for both simple names Jon Smith and also more complex names Jon Paul Del Carmenp  pAny advice would truly be appreciated.

Negative 2535 psituation We have a web service running on tomcat accessing DB2 database on AS400, we are using JTOPEN drivers for JNDI connections handled by tomcat. For handling transactions and access to database we are using Spring. p  pFor each select system takes JDBC connection from JNDI i.e. from connection pool, does selection, and in the end it closes ResultSet, Statement and releases Connection in that order. That passes fine, shared lock on table dissappears. p  pWhen we want to do update the same way as we did with select exception on ResultSet object, we dont have one in such situation, after releasing Connection to JNDI lock on table stays. p  pIf we put maxIdle0 for number of connections in JNDI configuration, this problem disappears, but this degrades performances, we have cca 100 users online on that service, we need few connections to be alive in pool. p  pWhat do you suggest p

Negative 2535 pI have recently discovered the ability to use WHERE clauses within indexes in SQL Server 2005.  I would like to optimize some queries, and was hoping to get some feedback.p  pThe table of interest contains 2 float columns, [long] and [short].  These columns could be 0 in 2040 of rows.  There are several stored procs that query this table with one of the following clausesp  ul liWHERE long lt 0 OR short lt 0li liWHERE long lt 0 AND short lt 0li ul  pI am considering putting indexes on long and short or one index on both with the condition WHERE lt 0 in the hopes that the stored procs will be able to use an index scan rather than a table scan to grab this data.p  pGiven the above info, how would you go about creating indexes  Or, if an index isnt the best solution, what are reasonable alternatives  Thanks in advance.p

Negative 2535 pIm developing a Java EE 6 application where providers should be able to define a price and different discounts on a service for users. There are many different providers. Each one provides the same service, the pricing models can be different.p  pPrice Model  A provider should be able to define the price e.g. per hour, per minute, per process, ... .   The provider should be able to easily add conditions to define the discount a user gets. For example users from a specific usergroup get a discount of 10 and users who used the service more than 5 times get another discount.   It shoulld be able to link conditions with logical operations like AND or OR.  The amount of possible conditions should be defined by the software manufacturer.p  ul liWhen a user tries to access the service the userspecific price should be shown. After using the service the particular user gets sometime an invoice where the total cost of this service is listed. While using the service the provider can change the pricing model, so there must be a version number or something. The pricing model versions should then be saved in a database.li ul  pThe Question is  Is it possible and meaningful to use a rule engine to solve this specification  Provider should define conditions without xml files or something like that, just by clicking and choosing. I have no experience with rule engines... so maybe someone can help me to figure out which solution is best for the problem.p

Negative 2535 pI have a webapp that has a master mysql db and four slave dbs.  I want to handle all or almost all readonly SELECT queries from the slaves.  Our loadbalancer sends the user to one of the slave machines automatically, since they are also running ApachePHP and serving webpages.  I am using an include file to setup the connection to the databases, such asp  precodefor master server i.e.  UPDATEINSERTDELETE statements Host  10.0.0.x User  xx Password  xx Link  mysqlconnect Host, User, Password  if Link       die Master database is currently unavailable.  Please try again later.    this connection can be used for READONLY i.e.  SELECT statements on the localhost HostLocal  localhost UserLocal  xx PasswordLocal  xx LinkLocal  mysqlconnect HostLocal, UserLocal, PasswordLocal   fail back to master if slave db is down if LinkLocal       LinkLocal  mysqlconnect Host, User, Password   codepre  pI then use Link for all update queries and LinkLocal as the connection for SELECT statements.  Everything works fine until the slave server database goes down.  If the local db is down, the LinkLocal  mysqlconnect call takes at least 30 seconds before it gives up on trying to connect to the localhost and returns back to the script.  This causes a huge backlog of page serves and basically shuts down the system due to the extremely slow response time.p  pDoes anyone know of a better way to handle connections to slave servers via PHP  Or, is there some kind of timeout function that could be used to stop the mysqlconnect call after 23 secondsp  pThanks for the help.

Negative 2535 pThe answer to just about every single question about using C with json seems to be use JSON.NET but thats not the answer Im looking for.p  pthe reason I say that is, from everything Ive been able to read in the documentation, JSON.NET is basically just a better performing version of the DataContractSerializer built into the .net framework...p  pWhich means if I want to deserialize a JSON string, I have to define the full, stronglytyped class for EVERY request I might have. so if I have a need to get categories, posts, authors, tags, etc, I have to define a new class for every one of these things.p  pThis is fine if I built the client and know exactly what the fields are, but Im using someone elses api, so I have no idea what the contract is unless I download a sample response string and create the class manually from the JSON string.p  pIs that the only way its done Is there not a way to have it create a kind of hashtable that can be read with json[propertyname]p  pFinally, if I do have to build the classes myself, what happens when the API changes and they dont tell me as twitter seems to be notorious for doing Im guessing my entire project will break until I go in and update the object properties...p  pSo what exactly is the general workflow when working with JSON And by general I mean libraryagnostic. I want to know how its done in general, not specifically to a target library...p  pI hope that made sense, this has been a very confusing area to get into...p  pthanksp

Negative 2535 pI am a newbie using Eclipse to develop Java program, and here is my question should I check in my .project and .classpath filep  pMy friend told me that I should only check in .java files and the build.xml to guarantee portability. He said .classpath will cause you much less portability on different environment. .project is entirely your local eclipse settingp  pI agree with him, but partially. p  p Not checking in .project file will make my development less efficient I cant simply import a project code from a directoryp  p Not checking in .classpath file seems OK to me  if my build.xml is written carefully.p  pAnyone wants to share their experience here thanksp  pSeanp

Negative 2535 pIm trying to create the affect of a tool tip with a triangle pointer on top of an unordered list. To create the triangle, I thought I would just create a square div, rotate it 45 degrees, and give it the same background color as the unordered list.p  pAs you can probably guess, this works great in everything except in IE. The problem Im having is that it seems that the overflow is hidden on the ul, so when I position the pointer div half outside of the ul to create the triangle effect, the top half of the div is hidden.p  pI have tried to change overflows and zindexes to get this to work, but no luck. Im thinking it has to do with the gradient filter applied to the ul, maybe that applies an overflow rule I know I can probably just move the pointer div outside of the list, but this will be display on hover of another element, and Id rather just display the ul on hover, instead of the ul and the div.p  pDoes anybody know how I can fix thisp  pChrome screen shot img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comYPLEp.png altenter image description herep  pIE screen shot img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comYbA8H.png altenter image description herep  pNOTE I added borders to the rotated div to make it easier to tell what Im talking about.p  pHTMLp  precodeltulgt     ltligtltdiv idpointergtltdivgtlta hrefgtList Item 1ltagtltligt     ltligtlta hrefgtList Item 2ltagtltligt     ltligtlta hrefgtList Item 3ltagtltligt     ltligtlta hrefgtList Item 4ltagtltligt     ltligtlta hrefgtList Item 5ltagtltligt     ltligtlta hrefgtList Item 6ltagtltligt     ltligtlta hrefgtList Item 7ltagtltligt     ltligtlta hrefgtList Item 8ltagtltligt     ltligtlta hrefgtList Item 9ltagtltligt     ltligtlta hrefgtList Item 10ltagtltligt     ltligtlta hrefgtList Item 11ltagtltligt     ltligtlta hrefgtList Item 12ltagtltligt     ltligtlta hrefgtList Item 13ltagtltligt     ltligtlta hrefgtList Item 14ltagtltligt     ltligtlta hrefgtList Item 15ltagtltligt     ltligtlta hrefgtList Item 16ltagtltligt     ltligtlta hrefgtList Item 17ltagtltligt     ltligtlta hrefgtList Item 18ltagtltligt     ltligtlta hrefgtList Item 19ltagtltligt     ltligtlta hrefgtList Item 21ltagtltligt     ltligtlta hrefgtList Item 22ltagtltligt     ltligtlta hrefgtList Item 23ltagtltligt ltulgt codepre  pCSSp  precodeul      positionabsolute     top41px     left175px     width540px     height361px     padding0     zindex15     marginbottom20px     border1px solid DEDCD9     borderrightnone     backgroundcolor F5EFE3     mozborderradius 0 0 0 12px     webkitborderradius 0 0 0 12px     borderradius 0 0 0 12px     backgroundimage mozlineargradienttop, F5EFE3, FFF  FF3.6      backgroundimage webkitgradientlinear,left top,left bottom,colorstop0, F5EFE3,colorstop1, FFF  Saf4, Chrome      backgroundimage webkitlineargradient69F5EFE3A89D, FFF  Chrome 10, Saf6      backgroundimage lineargradienttop, F5EFE3, FFF     filter progidDXImageTransform.Microsoft.gradientstartColorStrF5EFE3, EndColorStrFFFFFF  IE6IE9    ul li      displayinline     lineheight32px     width269px     borderright1px solid DEDCD9     borderbottom1px solid DEDCD9     floatleft     margin0     padding0     overflowvisible   ul li a      displayblock     texttransformnone     paddingleft20px     color407d85   pointer      positionabsolute     height 15px     width 15px     left10px     top8px     border1px solid black     border0     backgroundcolorF5EFE3     webkittransformrotate45deg     moztransformrotate45deg     transformrotate45deg     filter progidDXImageTransform.Microsoft.MatrixsizingMethodauto expand, M110.7071067811865476, M120.7071067811865475, M210.7071067811865475, M220.7071067811865476  IE6,IE7      msfilter progidDXImageTransform.Microsoft.MatrixSizingMethodauto expand, M110.7071067811865476, M120.7071067811865475, M210.7071067811865475, M220.7071067811865476  IE8    .lte8 pointer      top12px  codepre

Negative 2535 pI dont really need help with the code, but I have a question about CSS and PHP. Im still trying to learn CSS. Please forgive me if I have problems explaining properly.p  pMy website is made up of several .php scripts that always calls from my main include php script. This script contains the header, overall layout, login check, javascript, and scripts that fix errors and log certain stats. This include file calls my style.css sheet. So, every page loads the style.css because every page calls my include file.p  pHere is my problem.p  precodeul     margin0px 0px 0px 0px     padding0px 0px 0px 0px   li     margin0px 10px 3px 10px     padding2px     liststyletypenone     displayblock     backgroundcolor606a86     width125px codepre  pThis is for a menu. I havent used this a lot, because Im still learning, but that code works perfect for the menu I use with javascript. But, I want to use ul and li elsewhere on my site, but I dont want the same look. Basically, I want to have a different look elsewhere when I use class. Problem is, if I try add a ul.example or li.example it doesnt work like it does on other tags when using class.p  pIve also tried directly adding the css to the page, but it still loads the style I have for the menu.p  pNote that I have tried giving both separate ids, such as ul.ex1 and ul.ex2, same goes for the li.p  pAm I just completely lost with CSS, or is there a certain way to do thisp
Negative 2535 pI come from a ASP.Net background and taking baby steps in open source world. I have an image based application and for every image click I want to log data on server. Im using DjangoPython to host this application. p  pMy understanding is that I need to process this data on client side and send to server using Ajax calls. Please correct me if Im wrong. In ASP.net world, we had runatserver tag for every HTML control that  made logging data on server really easy. Is there something similar in DjangoPythonp  pAlso, what is the most efficient way of logging image data in this situationp  pThanks in advance. Your help is highly appreciated.p  pCheersp

Negative 2535 pHi all, I have a problem that I believe will end up a minor syntax problem.  I hope.  I am pulling data from a camera into an app using WIA 2.0 on a windows 7 machine using c. The problem involves the timestamp. I dont want to transfer the image until I check if its timestamp is within a range. Here is the chopped down important part of the code. The sample here is from my test harness where I just do everything in one fell swoop, not from the real code. Again, I can make everything work fine if I ignore time, but that isnt an option.p  precodeWIA.DeviceManager devMgr  new WIA.DeviceManager   foreach DeviceInfo info in devMgr.DeviceInfos          if info.Type  WiaDeviceType.CameraDeviceType grab the first camera                cameraDevice  info.Connect         break             codepre  pHere there is a loop of i items in the camera each item is a pic at this point   p  precodeWIA.Item item  cameraDevice.Items[i]     timestamp  item.Properties.getItemItem Time Stamp.getValue.ToString   codepre  pNow on that last line it just returns codeSystem.ComObjectcode. I have no idea how to get the value out of this object, I cant casttransmutate it to anything useful, it has no properties I can find.  Can anyone help me with getting the value out of this timestamp objectp  pOn a side note, its amazing how few samples there are in the world of people using c and WIA. Just sayin.p

Its a 2D canvas and each row represents a line on the canvas. Guess its also important to know that the maximum range selected for 1 field is never bigger than 1200 pixels. A few weeks ago I upgraded to MySQL 5.5.10 and started using partitions. The x1  10000 hashw as my first and unaware approach to get into the partition topic. It already gave me a decent boost in SELECT speed, but Im sure theres still room for optimizations.p  pOh, and before you ask... Im aware of the fact that Im using a MyISAM table. A friend of mine suggested innoDB, but tried it already and the result was a 2 times bigger table and a big drop in SELECT performance. I dont need no fancy transactions and stuff.... all I need is the best possible SELECT performance and a decent performance with INSERTs.p  pWhat would you change Could I perhaps tweak my indexes somehow Does my partion setup make any sense at all Should I perhaps increase the number of partition filesp  pAll suggestions are welcome... I also discussed a local replication into a memory table with a friend, but Im sure its only a matter of time until the table size would exeed my RAM and a swapping box is a fairly ugly thing to see.p  pWhen you think about my issue please keep in mind that its growing rapidly and unpredictably.

Negative 2535 pI need to dynamically load many sometimes hundreds of thumbnail images.  For performance reasons I need to do this in a limited number of requests, I am using a single requestresponse for testing.  I am sending the binary data for the images in the response and loading them into BitmapImages using a MemoryStream.

Negative 2535 pOK, so this may be an odd situation but please bear with me.p  pI have a Python program which calls up a C class via a SWIG interface. I came to a point where I must asynchronously signal to update a status the Python code from the C library. Originally I had inefficient busy loops which polled a flag. I wanted to replace this by using codeSIGUSR1code.p  pSo, the problem is I discovered that even though these are separate threads, they share the same PID. That is the Python and C program both report the same PID. I have sent the signal using codekillcode, and the Python code caught it in its handler, however it did not interrupt the code as I expected. I tried two methods of waiting for the signal in the Python code, first py calling Pythons codesignal.pausecode which I read was supposed to be preempted on the reception of a signal. The other one was a simple codetime.sleepcode which was supposed to do basically the same thing  return when the signal comes through.p  pFor some reason this isnt working  my C code sends the signal, the Python code receives it and calls the handler, however, the pausesleep calls never return.p  pIf it is possible to correctly signal the same process, how would you do itp  pand if this is just dumb forgive me and move onp

Negative 2535 pI have been working on a local LAN service which uses a multicast port to coordinate several machines.  Each machine listens on the multicast port for instructions, and when a certain instruction is received, will send messages directly to other machines.p  pIn other words the multicast port is used to coordinate peertopeer UDP messaging.p  pIn practice this works quite well but there is a lingering issue related to correctly setting up these peertopeer transmissions.  Basically, each machine needs to announce on the multicast port its own IP address, so that other machines know emwhereem to send messages when they wish to start a P2P transmission.p  pI realize that in general the idea of identifying the local IP is a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions630164howdoyougettheipaddressfromaremotemachinenot necessarily sensiblea, but I dont see any other way the local receiving IP emmustem be announced one way or another.  At least I am not working on the internet, so in general I wont need to worry about NATs, just need to identify the local LAN IP.  No more than 1 hop for the multicast packets is allowed.p  pI wanted to, if possible, determine the IP passively, i.e., without sending any messages.  I have been using code that calls codegetifaddrscode, which returns a linked list of NICs on the machine, and I scan this list for nonzero IP addresses and choose the first one.p  pIn general this has worked okay, but we have had issues where for example a machine with both a wired and wifi connection are active, it will identify the wrong one, and the only workaround we found was to turn off the wifi.p  pNow, I imagine that a more reliable solution would be to send a message to the multicast telling other machines to report back with the source address of the message that might allow to identify which IP is actually visible to the other machines on the net.  Alternatively maybe even just looking at the multicast loopback message would work.p  pWhat do you think, are there any passive solutions to identify which address to use  If not, whats the best active solutionp  pIm using POSIX socket API from C.  Must work on Linux, OS X, Windows.  For Windows I have been using codeGetAdapterAddressescode.p

Negative 2535 pI am new to VB.net and have created a simple master detail windows form.  I created a two table data set and then dropped the master table on the form as a continues form or a detail form with several text boxes to hold the data. The child form is a data grid.p  ptest data that I have added directly to the database shows up with the proper parent child relationships on the form.  I can also enter new records into the database using the parent only portion of my form.p  pWhen I attempt to enter a complete record with data in both the parent form and the child data grid I get this error.p  blockquote   pThe codeINSERTcode statement conflicted with the codeFOREIGN KEYcode constraint   codeFKtblComplainanttblUseOfForcecode. The conflict occurred in database   codeCSQLFILESCCTS2.MDFcode, table codedbo.tblUseOfForcecode, column codeUOFIDcode.   The statement has been terminated.p blockquote  pcodetblComplainantcode is the child and codetblUseOfForcecode is the master.

I have noted in earlier versions of VB.net you had to enter code to save the child record, but the VB 2010 code does not seem to use the same syntax so I assumed the codeUpdateAllcode eliminated the need for the extra codep

Negative 2535 pIm using Freescale Kinetis K60 and using the CodeWarrior IDE which I believe uses GCC for the complier.p  pI want to multiply two 32 bit numbers which results in a 64 bit number and only retain the upper 32 bits.p  pI think the correct assembly instruction for the ARM CortexM4 is the SMMUL instruction.  I would prefer to access this instruction from C code rather than assembly.  How do I do thisp  pI imagine the code would ideally be something like thisp  precodeint a,b,c  a  1073741824    0x40000000  0.5 as a D0 fixed point number b  1073741824    0x40000000  0.5 as a D0 fixed point number  c  long longab gtgt 31   31 because there are two sign bits after the multiplication                               so I can throw away the most significant bit codepre  pWhen I try this in CodeWarrior, I get the correct result for c 536870912  0.25 as a D0 FP number.  I dont see the SMMUL instruction anywhere and the multiply is 3 instructions UMULL, MLA, and MLA  I dont understand why it is using a unsigned multiply, but that is another question.  I have also tried a right shift of 32 since that might make more sense for the SMMUL instruction, but that doesnt do anything different.p

Negative 2535 pWe have an external web service that we access during a custom pipeline stage in FAST. Our task is to get the XML that is output by this web service and store it into a scope field. At this point we have tried the following thingsp  ol lipInputting the XML output by the web service directly into the scope field i.e. using codedocument.Setxml, webserviceOutputcode, where codexmlcode is a scope field and webserviceOutput is of a form akin to codeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8 gtltrootgtltelementgt...ltelementgtltrootgtcode. This did not work and the FAST pipeline complained in the logs that the data was of the wrong type i.e. codelttype strgtcode.pli lipWe also tried inputting the XML output of the web service directly into a flat field and then using the XMLParser and XMLScopifier to convert the string into the right format expected by the scope field. This also did not work and the FAST pipeline complained that the XML data in our flat field was invalid. Upon closer inspection, we discovered that FAST escaped all of the angle brackets of the XML web service output into codeampltcode and codeampgtcode before storing the string into the flat field. This seems to be the cause of the XMLParser not being able to convert the string into the right object expected by the XMLScopifier. pli ol  pTo determine what was going on when we first saw second error above, we ran a simple FQL query from the web frontend i.e. a hrefhttplocalhost15100cgibinxsearchoffset0amphits10ampquerya relnofollowhttplocalhost15100cgibinxsearchoffset0amphits10ampqueryaa and looked at the source of the XML returned e.g. kbdctrlukbd on Firefox. p  pThe angle brackets and the quotes in the XML value of the flat field of interest had all been escaped to codeampltcode codeampgtcode and codeampquotcode. We initially thought this could be a product of the browser attempting to display the XML string correctly, but the same thing does not happen in the body field i.e. codeltFIELD NAMEbodygtcode that also contains tags in its string value e.g. codeltsepgtconvert the whole structure to ltkeygtaltkeygt series of maps ltsepgtcreate ltkeygtaltkeygt dao that handles all interaction withltsepgtcode.p  pThere is also the possibility that FAST is escaping the characters just before the results are sent to the browser, although I am not sure how we can determine if this is the case.p  pHow can we solve thisp  pWe are basically stuck on this at the moment and have absolutely no idea how to move forward from here, so any help or hints would be much appreciatedp  pMany thanksp

Negative 2535 pIm reading on JVM tuning, and it occurred to me that the JVM keeps moving objects around when it does GC. But Java Objects have references to each other, which one would presume are implemented as pointers, but the JVM cant possibly go over the whole heap after every time it moved objects around, and update all the references surely that would take for ever. So how does it resolve references, if the references do not change, but the physical location of the objects dop  pIve read a lot about the JVM, but that was never explained, or even hinted at, anywhere.p  p[EDIT] My point is that references are oneway things. Going from the pointer to the pointed is instantaneous, but going the other way around would require a full heap scan. While it is possible, it seems unlikely. If 10K objects survive a minor collection, how long would it take to do a full heap scan 10K times to update the references to those objects There must be some kind of optimized algorithm or structure used.p

Negative 2535 pThis is related to this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1151987canisetanunlimitedlengthformaxjsonlengthinwebconfigquestiona, but in this case its not something I am returning but rather the model binding. I am using a hrefhttppostmarkapp.comPostmarka to handle incoming emails, which posts to a page with a a hrefhttpdeveloper.postmarkapp.comdeveloperinboundparse.htmlJSON payloada. p  pI have a model as below and an action that takes in this JSON payload posted with applicationjson and processes it. p  precodepublic class EmailModel      public IDictionaryltstring, stringgt Headers  get set      public string From  get set      public string Cc  get set      public string HtmlBody  get set      public string TextBody  get set      public string ReplyTo  get set      public string Tag  get set      public string To  get set      public string MessageID  get set      public string MailboxHash  get set      public string Subject  get set      public ListltAttachmentgt Attachments  get set    public class Attachment      public string Content  get set      public int ContentLength  get set      public string ContentType  get set      public string Name  get set    codepre  pThis works fine for small attachments, but for anything that exceeds the default maxJsonLength property causes an error in deserialization. Error during serialization or deserialization using the JSON JavaScriptSerializer. The length of the string exceeds the value set on the maxJsonLength property. Because I want to accept image attachments, this means most images fail.p  pIve tried updating the web.config, but as per those other threads, this doesnt help for MVC controllers. I figure I can probably do what was mentioned in a custom IModelBinder, but Im struggling with how to intercept the deserialization. In other words, it still fails because the deserialization has happened already. p  pAny suggestions Im sure its just something stupid that Im missing.... p

Negative 2535 pI am working with multiple codeXElementcode objects to provide some userspecified data for several objects in my library.  Im trying to avoid specifying the structure of the entire XML file because the library shouldnt care what the entire XML looks like as long as the specific elements it needs are structured correctly.p  pTo that end, I have 3 separate codeXSDcode files that define schema for each of the 3 codeXElementscode my class needs, however I am running into some problems validating the XElement against the schema.  There doesnt appear to be a method to do that without a workaround.p  pFrom the MSDN page, the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarybb349001.aspx relnofollowcodeXElement.Validatecodea extension method appears to be geared to revalidating subelements of a larger file.  The codeXmlSchemaObjectcode argument is causing my problems as I cannot assume it will be present in any of the codeXElementscode.  I think I can work around this issue by grabbing the codeXmlSchemaElementcode from my codeXmlSchemaSetcode to pass as the codeXmlSchemaObjectcode argument, but since the codeXmlSchemaSetcode already defines everything, it seems strange to have to do that.  p  pIs there a better option for validating an codeXElementcode with a schema without first validating the entire codeXDocumentcodep  pOr should i just let the business layer handle the schema validation in the application and let the library assume the codeXElementcode is properly formed I considered this option, but as a personal preference prefer to avoid throwing exceptions and would rather just let the calling method know that the codeXElementcode is invalid via a return parameter.p

Negative 2535 pI am using wxWidgets to draw a large flow chart, i.e. 625 x 26329 pixels. The program was transported from Qt to wxWidgets. It is easy in layout with a main frame which has a customized scroll window inside. The scroll window draws part of the chart every time within updated client region. p  pNow Qt and wxWidgets make much difference. When scrolling vertically with mouse rolling, Qt refreshs painting the chart very smoothly, while wxWidgets is slowly with flicker.p  pCan anyone tell me how to make the painting efficientlyp

Negative 2535 pWe need to add a new profiling feature to our WCF application, for logging where time is spendt in the application. Im looking at PostSharp for a convention driven approach of applying the logging and need some input on how to actually log it. Ive already created a custom class for logging purposes, using StopWatch and can log the steps through the layers of my WCF application. However Im wondering if theres a thread safe alternative library I could use in conjunction with PostSharp for this purpose. Ive come across MiniProfiler, but it seems to be intended for ASP.NET MVC applications mainly. Any other frameworks I should consider or should I just use my custom class Thanksp

Negative 2535 pOn the homework I am working on we are making a hash cracker. I am implementing it so as to have my cracker. java call worker.java. Worker.java implements Runnable.

Negative 2535 pIm considering porting the  java library a hrefhttpgamadu.comartemis relnofollowArtemisa. An entity system framework. I havnt started yet.

I know there is half worked up a hrefhttpwww.gamedev.netblog1390entry2254064cportofartemisentitycomponentsystemframeworkinprogress relnofollowCPP porta.p  pIve looked at both codes and noticed that the java code puts certain things more elegantly. And mainly the followingp  precodepackage com.artemis  import java.util.HashMap  public class ComponentTypeManager      private static HashMapltClasslt extends Componentgt, ComponentTypegt componentTypes  new HashMapltClasslt extends Componentgt, ComponentTypegt      public static final ComponentType getTypeForClasslt extends Componentgt c         ComponentType type  componentTypes.getc          iftype  null             type  new ComponentType             componentTypes.putc, type                   return type           public static long getBitClasslt extends Componentgt c         return getTypeForc.getBit           public static int getIdClasslt extends Componentgt c         return getTypeForc.getId       codepre  pAnd the componentType objectp  precodepackage com.artemis  public class ComponentType      private static long nextBit  1     private static int nextId  0      private long bit     private int id      public ComponentType          init           private void init          bit  nextBit         nextBit  nextBit ltlt 1         id  nextId           public long getBit          return bit           public int getId          return id       codepre  pBasically what the componentTypeManager does is map a componentType to a class type. Which makes it dynamic when adding new components.p  pThe C port solution is as followsp  precodeifndef COMPONENTTYPEH define COMPONENTTYPEH  namespace SGF      enum ComponentType               CTTRANSFORM  0,         CTHEALTH,         CTRENDERABLE,         CTRIGIDBODY,         CTJOINT,          CTLAST            Component type bits. Used by the entity systems to determine if an entity is compatible.     const unsigned int CTTRANSFORMBIT   1 ltlt CTTRANSFORM     const unsigned int CTHEALTHBIT      1 ltlt CTHEALTH     const unsigned int CTRENDERABLEBIT  1 ltlt CTRENDERABLE     const unsigned int CTRIGIDBODYBIT  1 ltlt CTRIGIDBODY     const unsigned int CTJOINTBIT       1 ltlt CTJOINT   endif codepre  pHere the ComponentManager is completely left out. Instead an enum is used. My problem with this is the fact you have to add new component types to the enumerator and the constants as type identifiers. The java framework allows you to pass a component class type to identify its id. p  pMy question is, how would I go about to get a similar effect of passing a type to map its id like the Java code without hard coding enumerator types for every new component I know C doesnt support class types as arguments. So this is rather mind boggling to me.p

Negative 2535 pI have following code, where I used HashMap using two parallel arrays for storing keyvalue pairs key can have multiple values. Now, I have to store and load it for future use thats why I store and load it by using File Channel. Issue with this code is I can store nearly 120 millions of keyvalue pairs in my 8 GB server actually, I can allocate nearly 5 gb out of 8 gb for my JVM, and those two parallel arrays takes nearly 2.5 gb, other memory are used for various processing of my code. But, I have to store nearly 600700 millions of keyvalue pairs. Can anybdoy help me how to modify this code thus I can store nearly 600700 millions of keyvalue pairs. Or any comment on this will be nice for me. Another point, I have to load and store the hashmap tofrom memory. It takes little bit long time using file channel. As per various suggestions of Stack Overflow, I didnt find faster one. I have used ObjectOutputStream, Zipped output stream also, however, slower than below code. Is there anyway to store those two parallel arrays in such a way thus loading time will be much faster. I have given below in my code a test case.

Negative 2535 pIm porting a program originally written in VB.NET to Java. Im reading from a file which stores 32 bit floats in little endian order.p  pThe original program does thisp  precodeDim br As BinaryReader  ... Dim fvb As Single  br.ReadSingle codepre  pJava is big endian, so I reverse the bytes before converting to a float.p  precodeRandomAccessFile raf   ... int i  raf.readInt int bigEndian  Integer.reverseBytesi float fjava  Float.intBitsToFloatbigEndian codepre  pAs far as I can tell, codefvbcode and codefjavacode contain the same bits. That is, codeBitConverter.ToInt32code on codefvbcode and codeFloat.floatToIntBitscode and codefloatToRawIntBitscode on codefjavacode give the same thing. However, the floats are not equal. For example, let codebigEndian  0x4969F52Fcode. Java will report code958290.94code, and VB.NET will report code958290.938code. Im guessing this comes from a difference in the way the JVM and CLR handle floating point numbers, but I dont know enough about floating point issues to figure out why. This loss of precision is causing trouble down the line, so Id like to identify the source.p

You load your DB and get a bunch of objects like magic. CRUD stuff all gets done against objects. If the DB changes you change the mapping but your objects stay the same.p  pThis would imply that you are going to use these objects throughout the system, and that they will have behaviour. They are business objects. This makes sense to me, and indeed MS a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarycc716789.aspx relnofollowtells you how to add behaviourap  pHowever, Ive been reading lots of people saying that your should never use EF objects as your business objects as they are concerned with persistence of data only, and would couple your business objects with EF. They suggest using EF as an abstraction of the data layer, and mapping them to real business objects.p  pThis seems pointless to me. Why do I need yet ANOTHER abstraction layer when I still end up mapping to my business objects If I have to map EF properties, I might as well map DB columnsp  pI thought the whole point of an ORM was to automate the mapping and act as an abstraction over the backing store Am I missing somethingp  pstrongEDITstrong By behaviour I mean business logic.

Negative 2535 pIm having a problem fetching results from a Core Data store using predicates. What my application does is fetches results from the store based on one or more predicates and shows you either the results based on all of the predicates or the results based on each predicate.p  pIt works fine for the most part, except I cannot get less than queries  to work. Here is the code I am usingp  precodecase CriteriaSelectionIsLessThan         pred  [NSPredicate predicateWithFormatANY value.attribute.name   AND ANY value. lt , [attribute name], keyPath, [[activeValue value] value]]         break case CriteriaSelectionIsMoreThan         pred  [NSPredicate predicateWithFormatANY value.attribute.name   AND ANY value. gt , [attribute name], keyPath, [[activeValue value] value]]         break codepre  pThe code for the more than predicate works fine, it returns the data set for the query, such as  1970 a year. When I try to filter it using the less than predicate, such as lt 1970, it returns the entire Core Data dataset unfiltered.p  p[[activeValue value] value] is an NSNumber.p  pI cant figure it out for the life of me  the predicates are exactly the same but with one character differingp  pHelp would be greatly appreciated. If you require any more codeinformation let me know.p  pEdit heres how I map the data type on import from JSONp  precode[attrib setDataType[NSNumber numberWithInteger[[attribute valueForKeytype] integerValue]]]...   Set the correct data type of the value switch [[attrib dataType] integerValue]      case AttributeDataTypeNumber         [value setNumberValue[NSNumber numberWithInteger[valueForKey integerValue]]]         break     case AttributeDataTypeString            [value setStringValueNSString valueForKey]         break     case AttributeDataTypeDate          NSDateFormatter df  [[NSDateFormatter alloc] init]         [df setDateFormatddMMYYYY]         [value setDateValue[df dateFromStringNSString valueForKey]]              break     case AttributeDataTypeBool         [value setBooleanValue[NSNumber numberWithBool[valueForKey boolValue]]]         break  codepre  pSee, the data type in my JSON is guaranteed to be right as I check that before importing it not in the app. Even when I build a predicate that explicitly says that I want a certain dataType such as value.attribute.dataType  1 with 1 being a number in a enum it still doesnt work. Its really bizzarre.p

Negative 2535 pWhile working in highly interactive and animated client side web applications, we highly rely on jQuery libraries and use their events heavily. p  pIn large enterprise applications, this results in a big connection of the events, their callbacks and further to their internal method calls of 4 digit lines of code.

Negative 2535 pSo this question is an offshoot from another I recently asked, and this is more of a curiosity.p  pMy other question dealt with dynamically loading in external js libraries. In my example, I had jQuery Template importing, followed by Knockout.js, both using .getScript. When each finished loading, I was firing an alert, just to make sure they were loading correctly.p  pHeres the approximate code I was using seems to work in order on jsFiddle, so it couldve been my code before. The question still stands though.p  precode.getScripthttpsraw.github.comjqueryjquerytmplmasterjquery.tmpl.js, function alerttmpl finished loading  .getScripthttpcloud.github.comdownloadsSteveSandersonknockoutknockout2.2.0.js, function alertKnockout finished loading  codepre  pI discovered that the alert for Knockout was firing before the tmpl library when I loaded up the page, even though it is listed second.p  pMy assumption was that they would load synchronously, in queue fashion, waiting for the previous one to finish before loading the next. It appears that this is not the case.p  pstrongSo Im asking for verification of this assumption, and some explanation as to why this isisnt the case. Id also like to know if there is another [better] method to queue up script loading so that I dont run into problems with things being undefined because of dependencies on unloaded scripts.strongp

Negative 2535 pWe currently have a website with user login.p  pWe have a user table with userId.p  pWe now want users to have a duplicate profile, that is entirely seperate from their main profile. This needs to be a secret profile.p  pNow we could just add two records into the db, but the ids would be sequential until we hit a high hit rate of signups so a user could workout that a userId would be related to one ID higher.p  pI realise this is not an ideal solution, but it is a late change to a big software project so we are trying to be as pragmatic as possible, while requiring as little code change as possible.p  pOptionsp  ol liTurn off auto increment Ids, and build our own keyGeneration table. Start one table at 0, and start the secret one at 1000000000. We then can then turn off auto incrementing IDs in the user table, and use these keys.li ol  pThe problem is, does having keys running, 1,1000000000,2,1000000001,3,1000000002 cause a massive indexing problem Would we have to force index rebuilds all the timep  ol liWe key a seperate table just for the 2nd profile ids, again starting at 10000000000. We then modify all our code to check for ids  999999999 and flip the logic on the server side so the lookups work correctly.li ol  pMeans doing that check everywhere a user ID is passed into the site, from the front end.p  pAs we dont do that too much, we obviously mainly grab userId of logged in user securely, it might not be that bad.p  pAnyway, just wondering if anyone has any thoughts on thisp  pEditp  pTo put this into further context, imagine on stackoverflow or facebook, you have 2 profiles that you can control, that have no link between them. Like the way multiple users on Facebook can all act as a Page account, yet there is no link back from that account to the real user profile.p  pEssentially to not break referential integrity or re write too much code, I really want to pass an ID int back down to the front end for these account. Then the whole system just keeps ticking over as it has done.p  pGuid could be cool But it would have a performance overhead NOT THAT I CARE ABOUT THAT REALLY  but it would also mean writing a lot of code to handle Guids being what is passed to the front end not that we rely on front end variables being right but that is why I suggest the high int solution above. As we still have ASP.NET Membership lurking in the background I almost thought that could be good but A we plan to remove that one day or migrate to simple membership b we use sequential Guid generation in our user table for performance sorry again to talk about optimization, before its neededp

Negative 2535 pI was attempting to use worker threads to speed up a larger algorithm when I noticed that using independent priority queues on more threads actually slowed performance down. So I wrote a small test case.p  pIn which I query how many threads to start, set each thread to its own processor, and the push and pop a lot of stuff from my priority queues. Each thread owns its own priority queue, and theyre allocated separately so I dont suspect false sharing.p  pI put the test case a hrefhttppastie.org6226061 relnofollowherea, because its longer than a snippet. The processor affinity bit comes from a hrefhttpblog.ncrunch.netpostHowtosetathreadsprocessoraffinityinNET.aspx relnofollowNCrunchap  pThe priority queue is of my own creation because .NET didnt have a built in queue.

Negative 2535 pI am currently in development of a multitenant system that as core functionality of the system allows the user to define custom types. So for example, they would define an Event, Account, Order, Shipment whatever they choose. Every user in the system will have different definitions for what they want to manage in terms of fields. So for one user an Order may have an order number, status and due date where as for another user it might have 10 fields.p  pThe developers I am working with want to use EAV to store this data. I am opposed to this idea. I have read many articles on this site as well as all over the internet listing the disadvantages of this antidesign pattern, but none mentioning the approach im thinking of taking. I am trying to build this application such that it is scalable from the beginning.p  pWhen I do the math, if I have 1000 tenants, with an average of 5 types each 5000 types. Each type has 1000 records for example 5,000,000 records. Each record has on average 5 fields gives me a total of 25,000,000 rows at the lowest level of the EAV model. p  pA down stream process will also be binding each individual users data to a jquery grid, so first fetching this data and transposing the data just seems so costly to me. what happens when you have 10k tenants or 50k tenants... I understand that MySQL can handle this type of thing when optimized, however it just seems like im shooting myself in the foot.p  pI want to do it another way. However, I have a bad gut feeling about what I am proposing as it goes against everything I know, so I would like some real experts with practical knowledge to validate or criticise my approach. If you validate, please tell me what I need to do to support it and get it working. If you criticise, please tell me the pitfalls I will hit in the short term and the long term.p  pMy Proposal.p  ol liShard the system using domain partitioning such that there is a maximum set of tenants in any particular shard. The master catalogue will reference which tenant belongs to which shardli liFor each Shard, when a user defines a type, create a new table to hold this type. Hold a mapping table in the shard, which links the user to his defined types custom tables.li ol  pThis essentially means that I am going to have a handful of core tables in one shard and 1000s of custom tables. p  pNow to me, usually having that many tables in a database usually tells me that there is something wrong with the schema or that something has been designed incorrectly, but for this scenario, Im just curious to know if it is a feasible approach. In my previous example, it would mean that I have 5000 tables in the shard, with only 1000 rows each. which to me seems a better approach than using EAV. Based on the user, you find the Type and you bind the data to the grid.p  pSome Notes to considerp  ol lipThe multitenant architecture allows users to have their own users. So potentially I have 1000 subscribers, but 5000 users. So the database connections need to be managed. Will I hit problems managing the connectionspli lipWill I hit table caching related problems Will I have problems flushing tablespli lipWhere may I hit performance issues with this design I understand that the master catalouge database may be a bottleneck, but the load on this database will not be too heavy.pli lipDevelopment has started already, dont ask me to change to a NoSQL databasepli ol  pAnother suggestion was to also continue using EAV but within the shard. What do you think of this ideap  pPlease dont pull any punches I need to hear it all. Thanks in advance.p

Negative 2535 pI am experiencing a strange problem when trying to persist an association between two entities. When I use a codeSetcode i.e. the Grails default, it works, however if I try to use a codeListcode, the association in the child table is lost somewhere between setting it in my domain class and the SQL insert statement being generated.p  pIve extracted the offending code from my application, and set up the simplest test case that shows the problem  it involves the 3 domain objects shown below.p  precodeclass Client      String name     ListltModelFieldInstancegt clientModelFieldInstances     static hasMany  [clientModelFieldInstances ModelFieldInstance]   class ModelFieldDefinition      String name     static hasMany  [ modelFieldInstances ModelFieldInstance ]      def afterInsert          Client.findAll.each  client gt             ModelFieldInstance.withNewSession                  ModelFieldInstance modelFieldInstance  new ModelFieldInstance[modelFieldDefinition.id this.id, client.id client.id]                 modelFieldInstance.save                                 class ModelFieldInstance      String value     static belongsTo  [ modelFieldDefinition ModelFieldDefinition, client Client ]  codepre  pIn Bootstrap.groovy, Im creating one Client and one ModelFieldDefinition p  precodeClient client  new Clientname Some Client client.saveflush true  ModelFieldDefinition contactName  new ModelFieldDefinition[name Contact Name] contactName.saveflush true codepre  pThe afterInsert method in ModelFieldDefinition is used to create empty ModelFieldInstances for each Client. If I step through the afterInsert code using the STS debugger, I can see that modelFieldInstance.client has the correct value however once codemodelFieldInstance.savecode is invoked, I get an exception saying that modelFieldInstance.client is null p  precodeCaused by MySQLIntegrityConstraintViolationException Column clientid cannot be null codepre  pIf I change my codeClientcode class, removing the codeListcode declaration like so p  precodeclass Client      String name     static hasMany  [clientModelFieldInstances ModelFieldInstance]  codepre  pThen the association is persisted correctly. Why doesnt this work with codeListcodesp  pEDIT  I am using Grails 2.2.0p
Negative 2535 pI did my best to look around the web but this problem eludes me. I have a stored procedure in SSIS that works fine. It does a bunch of stuff eventually returning some numbers and text. The procedure itself uses temp tables since the data does not need to exist beyond the proc run and returns 931K rows.p  pThe next step was to bring the output of the proc into excel. Using MS query, I call the proc including the necessary parameters. it runs but the only data I get back is the columns with numbers. I am missing the text values. I thought it might be a text translation issue from SSIS to Excel so I changed the output from nvarchar to varchar and the problem remains. I wrote the proc so I can make any changes necessary. Also, I thought that it might be a temp table issue so I tried building a table, inserting the data there using the proc then pull that table into Excel and while I got a few more text columns, a number were still blank.p  pAre there any suggestionsp  pShort version of the problem SQL works in management studio but text is not returned to excel. The number or rows from the proc match the number of rows in Excel when it is finished importingupdating. The numbers come back as expected.p  pVersionsp  pExcel 2007   SQL Server 2005  Management studio 2008R2  ODBC connection using MS query  p  precodeUSE [cmdb] GO  SET ANSINULLS ON GO SET

Negative 2535 pI have a library PyModbus I would like to use that requires a tty device as it will be communicating with a device using serial connection. However, the device I am going to talk to is going to be behind a modem that supports serial over tcp the device plugs into a com port on the modem. p  pWithout the modem in the way it would be trivial. I would connect a usb serial cable to the device and the other end to the computer. With the modem in the way, the server has to connect to a tcp port on the modem and pump serial data through that. The modem passes the data received to the device connected to the com port.p  pIn linux, whats the best way to create a fake tty from the serial over tcp connection for momentary use and then be destroyed. This would happen periodically, and an individual linux server may have 10500 of these emulated device open at any given time.p

Negative 2535 pI am making CAD type software in VS2010 Pro using a C Windows Form Application and OpenTK. Nothing fancy I just want to be able to read in some basic shapes and draw them. Im not sure if this makes a difference to the answer, but I am drawing in 2D space using GL.Orthop  pTo get familiar with graphics Ive done a few OpenTK examples straight from the OpenTK documentation and have a basic understanding of it. From what Ive learned so far I cannot moverotate my primitives unless they were created within this eventp  precode    private void glControl1Paintobject sender, PaintEventArgs e           codepre  pMy program launches and waits for the user to select the CAD file to read in. After I read the file and break it down into primitives I draw it to the glControl1 form. So far it works as expected. However, I do not draw it in the glControl1Paint event. Thus I have no control to translaterotate it by using keyboardmouse inputs.p  pI have read answers to other questions where the asker was directed to draw in the glControl1Paint event. I would love to because it would solve my problem, but I am not sure how to do that since I dont have the primitives upon launch of the application, I wait for the user to provide the data.p  pI suppose I have a few questions that I would like to know the answers top  p1 When does the glControl1Paint event happen in the program I assumed it was part of initializing the glControl1 window and fired upon startup. Can I control when this happens so that I can draw my primitives here If so, how do I control when this happens and how do I pass my geometry into thisp  p2 Is there a way to translaterotate the my primitives outside of the glControl1Paint eventp

Negative 2535 pFirst, let me discuss the data model p  pIve compiled an HL7 definition in an treelike object model, with 3 levels  Segment, Element and Subelement. The segment contains a List, and the Element contains a List. The relationship between those is kinda like ContinentCountryCityp  pSecond, ive created a GUI component composed of 3 combobox, each having a different ComboBoxModel accessing the object model described earlier.p  pIve applied the Observer pattern on the ComboBoxModel, so that each model is aware of which Listlt it has to access br   the HL7DefinitionElementModel observes the HL7DefinitionSegmentModelBR   the HL7DefinitionSubelementModel observes the HL7DefinitionElementModel p  pWhen you pick a value in the first combobox the Segment, the HL7DefinitionElementModel updates and store which Segment have been picked. The data is correctly stored. The first value is correctly displayed in the closed JComboBox. But when you try to open that JComboBox the Element, if the number of elements is too big around 12, the items in the invoked Popup Menu are blank.p  pIll gladly post any code. I could send the entire project if needed, but havent been able to reduce it to a SSCEE. p  pEDIT  here is an illustration of the problemBR a hrefhttpimgur.comAiJ8mu0 relnofollowhttpimgur.comAiJ8mu0ap

Negative 2535 pIm hitting a wall in some work Im doing Ive searched on here for many, many threads regarding numerical interpolation and have found them either to contain too much math for me to interpret them, or that their coding solutions have been too specific to be generalized to the task Im working on.p  pI have sets of coordinates currently float x, y distances around an 0,0 origin point which I am, via Javascript, transposing to latitude, longitude coordinates. The transposition is easy, so dont worry about that Im just telling you that to make the application more clear. p  pFor the rest, refer to the below graphicp  pimg srchttpi.imgur.comJMBP3Jg.png altexamplep  pThe dots are the coordinates. They are generated algorithmically. The blue line shows a simple, linear interpolation between the points. What I want is something more like the red line. Its not emquiteem an ellipse  you can see that around the first coordinates, it forms arcs that are almost like a perfect circle. p  pNote that some of the points are negative in various places. Note that the lines between them must be draw sequentially  an algorithm that generates the points out of sequence will make things much harder for this application.p  pWhat Id like is to have a Javascript function that would let me do the following specify two sequential points from this series x1,y1 x2,y2, specify a number of interpolated steps in between say, 5 to 10, and then output an array of coordinates that would, when linked linearly that is, when a straight line is drawn between them, look something like the red line above with the degree of curviness obviously constrained by the number of steps. p  pOf all of the many spline functions out there, which of these satisfies these requirements The mathematical precision of the spline function is less important to me than the simplicity of adapting it to this purpose, and to its aesthetic output. I would be fine with manually setting the eccentricitycircleness of each individual set of coordinates, too so the first ones really should be very circlelike, but the latter should not be.p  pPut another way, I am looking for a simple function for getting the interior coordinates of an arc between any two sets of coordinates. EDIT to clarify that Im fine with there being a third variable that sets the inclination of the arc positive or negative and its eccentricity or whatever. The function doesnt necessarily have to know where it is on the diagram above, as I will know that. Im just looking for something that can help me interpolate the arc points.p  pI think I understand the parameters of the problem what Im bad at is geometry and turning mathematical answers into usable Javascript. Because I dont emreallyem understand the math.p  pI have already looked at a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiMidpointcirclealgorithm relnofollowMidpoint circle algorithma and found it difficult to adapt to this purpose because of the need for sequentiality and noninteger coordinates Ive also looked at a variety of a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiSplineinterpolation relnofollowspline interpolation methodsa and found them way too complicated for my dummyself to make sense of.p  pAny pointers, help, and code would be appreciated p
Negative 2535 pWindows handles are sometimes annoying to remember to clean up after doing GDI with created pens and brushes is a great example. An RAII solution is great, but is it really that great making one full Rule of Five RAII class for each different type of handle Of course not The best I can see would be one full generic RAII class with other classes just defining what to do when the handle should be cleaned up, as well as other handlespecific aspects. p  pFor example, a very simple module class could be defined like this just an examplep  precodestruct Module      Module  handlenullptr      ModuleHMODULE hm  handlehm, []HMODULE hFreeLibraryh      operator HMODULE const return handle.get  private     HandleltHMODULEgt handle  codepre  pThats all fine and dandy, and no destructor or anything is needed. Of course, though, being able to write the codeHandlecode class to not need a destructor or anything as well would be nice, too. Why not use existing RAII techniques One idea would be to use a smart pointer to a codevoidcode, but that wont work. Heres how the handles are actually declared under normal circumstancesp  precodedefine DECLAREHANDLEn typedef struct nint in DECLAREHANDLEHACCEL DECLAREHANDLEHBITMAP DECLAREHANDLEHBRUSH ... codepre  pIt actually differentiates between handle types, which is good, but it makes using a smart pointer to codevoidcode impossible.

It uses a handle to a desktop, which must be closed. Barring the differences between shared and unique pointers e.g., codeFreeLibrarycode has its own reference counting semantics, is assuming the handle is a pointer and making a smart pointer to whatever its pointing to okay, or should I not use smart pointers and make codeHandlecode implement the RAII aspects itselfp  precodeinclude ltmemorygt include lttypetraitsgt include ltutilitygt include ltwindows.hgt  int main      using underlyingtype  stdcommontypeltdecltypestddeclvalltHDESKgtgttype     stdsharedptrltunderlyingtypegt ptrnullptr, []HDESK deskCloseDesktopdesk  codepre

Negative 2535 pI am explaining the situation below which currently I am facing for the app I am working on.p  pThe app consists of the Login module which stores the data to the application local storage.

Negative 2535 pI want to have a persistent button in the bottom right corner of my app.  During all view transitions, the button should remain static.  Im having trouble deciding what view to add the button to.  I know the button ought to be stored in the AppDelegate, but I dont know what other view it would be sense to add it to except the window.  One downside of adding it to the window is that when theres an app running in the background ie Phone, the added status bar padding will push down the window.  In general, adding it to the window seems to be a hacky solution  any thoughtsp

Negative 2535 pI am new to reporting in asp.net and cant get the things work up good for me. Basically, I made a demo of what was told a hrefhttpweblogs.asp.netrajbkarchive20100509creatinganaspnetreportusingvisualstudio2010part1.aspx relnofollowherea. Everything worked fine and it generated report on my local system. But, did not worked on the web server. p  pNow, Ive got a confusion here There are 2 modes of a reporting in asp.net [VS 2010  .NET 4.0], Local Mode and Server Mode. Local Mode has RDLC extension and Server mode has RDL as extension for the report design file, and it requires Sql Server reporting for support, for which on the other hand RDLC is made on the Client Machine [it may look to be a dumb question but, is it my machine or my pc and not the web server, means I cannot deploy and use it on the web server].p  pThe base of the confusion is that I had uploaded the same demo project on my web hosting and ran it. The report Viewer control was showing perfectly and every thing was looking fine, but the actual report that was to be rendered was absent from below of the Report Viewer Toolbar. But, at the same time, I was able to download the PDF, XLS, and DOC format of the report completely fine, with the actual rows and columns generated, which shows that the report was being generated A bar graph was also included in the design of rdlc, and it generated as well. I guess this was because the webserver did not had Report Viewer libraries installed on it, and did not know how to render the RDLC file.p  pSo, here are the actual questions p  pAm I correct in the thinking that a report can be generated on the webserver when you have RDLC as the report file formatOr should I use the RDL instead p  pIf I deploy my application with RDLC Local Report, ofcourse on the strongweb serverstrong, will it work fine Is it possible to install or get the report viewer installed on the web serverp  pAnd when should I use an RDLC and RDL and when not. A previous question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1079162whentouserdlcoverrdlreportsWhen to use RDLC over RDL reportsa., but I am looking for a simpler explanation in my scenario.p
Negative 2535 pIm stuck in a problem and I cant find a solution to this, its annoying me.p  pIve two tables, one called emcontactsem and the other one called emphonebooksem and they are linked with a third table called contactsphonebooks, this is a manytomany relationship summarize belowp  ul licontacts id pkli liphonebooks id pkli licontactsphonebooks contactid fk, phonebooksid fk Pretty simple and clear, and it works.li ul  pIm using Laravel 4 and Eloquent ORM, everythings works fine when Ive to fetch it, insert it and delete it but when I need to update a contact I fail miserably. Ive a form that has a number of checkboxes that represent all the phonebooks every checkbox has phonebook[] as name so when you check one of those the phonebook id will be saved in the contactsphonebooks with the contact id.

This is weird I know, I try to explain it better. I want to update Mr.x and he actually is in Stackoverflow phonebook, I want to add him in Nerd phonebook so I click on update and I selected Nerd, the other one is already selected.p  pWhen I update him the system deletes the Stackoverflow link and save ONLY the Nerd phonebook with the code above this things driving me crazy because Laravel 4 Doc says that you should use the emsyncem method in order to update a manytomany relationship. p  pI dont how how to solve it, I hope you will understand whats my problem.p  pCheers. p

Negative 2535 pWhats the best practice and established way to portray an image I am working from the assumption that it shouldnt be done in HTML anymore so I am not using the codeimgcode tag in my markup. Instead, I am linking the image in my CSS via codebackground urldircode. If I am already going wrong with this assumption, let me know.p  pIf linking an image in CSS is the correct or at least a good, well established way to go, then the next question is what HTML tag to use in the document Technically, images can be applied to just about any element in HTML, so which ones the right one to use p  pCase in point Right now I am working on a row of icons where each icon has some text underneath it. At the moment, I have it set up as an unordered, horizontal list and I am applying the image and text in my CSS to each individual list item tag. However, there are several other ways I could do this. I could have a row of codedivscode or codespanscode, for example. Or I could use the codeimgcode tag without defining the codesrccode property in the HTML and instead setting it in the CSS at least I think this is possible. Or several other ways I can think.p  pWhat is the best practice in cases like thisp
Negative 2535 pstrongEDITstrong Problem solved, see belowp  hr  pWe had to migrate a MFC application from Visual Studio 2003 to 2008 a while back. It went OK for the most part, except for a huge flaw  the release build doesnt display our dialogs right, whereas the debug build works just fine.p  pHere is a sample of what it should look like and what it looks like in debug  a hrefhttpimg11.hostingpics.netpics864144InterfaceOK1OUT.png relnofollowhttpimg11.hostingpics.netpics864144InterfaceOK1OUT.pngap  pThe black squares are on the picture on purpose And here is what the release build looks like  a hrefhttpimg11.hostingpics.netpics813251InterfaceKO1OUT.png relnofollowhttpimg11.hostingpics.netpics813251InterfaceKO1OUT.pngap  pNow, to try to solve this, I went through different steps p  ul liI built the runtime library with strongMDdstrong in Release configuration, and ran it out of VS dirty, I know it works well, I get an error when closing, which could be expected, but its obviously far from ideal.li liI ran Dependency Walker on Debug and Release executables and compared them both  apart from the Debug DLL MSVC[PR]90D and MFC90D, its mostly the same. I didnt find anything meaningful there.li liI tried to debug my Release build by following the steps described in MSDN msdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryfsk896zzvvs.90.aspx , which presented a peculiar behaviour  while debugging the exe in VS, the dialogs were rendered correctly. However, taking the same .exe file and launching out of VS presented the wrong dialogs display again.li ul  pI thought at first that it was some DLL that wasnt here or was in the wrong version oh, its probably relevant to mention that we also went from x86 to x64 systems the application is still developed in 32 bits though, but since the Release debugging, Im not so sure, since it doesnt use the Debug DLLs verified it in process explorer.p  pIm at a loss here and furthermore not really c savvy, so any help at all would be greatly appreciated p  pstrongEDITstrong Both dialogs contain actually the same components, the one in the Release build appears collapsed, mostly in the upper left corner, as if it didnt know where to put the components.p  pstrongEDITstrong OK, problem solved p  pOK, that was quite silly...p  pThe problem was in the following bit of code p  precodeCMainFrame pFrame  new CMainFrame mpMainWnd  pFrame CRect rect pFramegtCreateNULL, formatStringIDRTITRE, WSCAPTION  MFSSYNCACTIVE, rect, 0 codepre  pCMainFrame inherits from CMiniFrameWnd p  pCRect rect was OK in VS2003, and even appears to be OK in Debug build in VS 2008, although in retrospect I assume it was wrong all along since it doesnt initialize the object as said here  msdn.microsoft.comfrfrlibrary9y3502k0vvs.90.aspx . So for some reason, this wouldnt work in the Release build.p  pI had to edit it like so p  precodeCMainFrame pFrame  new CMainFrame mpMainWnd  pFrame CRect rect0,0,0,0 pFramegtCreateNULL, formatStringIDRTITRE, WSCAPTION  MFSSYNCACTIVE, rect, 0 codepre  pThe dimensions of the frame are reworked later, so it doesnt really matter which value I assign to it, but it appears I have to assign them.p  pWith this done, the application works and appears fine.p  pThanks Michael for pointing me in the right direction, I was going for a more far fetched solution.p

Negative 2535 pIm having a problem in my Android app and didnt find any related topic in the forum maybe I just didnt know how to look for itp  pI have a project that generates a .jar file with some classes I use in two other projects basically a serverclient structure, the Android app being the client. I have built another project in order to test specifically this generated .jar, and it works fine. When I add it to the android app I can declare and use the classes having no compilation problem, but when I execute the app using BlueStacks I get this ClassNotFoundException. If I keep clicking Resume I get also a NoClassDefFound exception when trying to instantiate one of the classes from the generated .jar.p  pIs there any extra configuration other than including it in the build path I have to make to be able to use or generate this .jar Im using Eclipse Kepler, Android 4.2.2 and Java 1.7.p

Negative 2535 pI have a pretty simple requirement I thought, a window that shows an image at a certain start point amp size and moveszooms it to a certain end point and size. This is not the typical Image Viewer requirement for panampzoom. More like a sprite animation.p  pI tried out a couple of ways, e.g. a ThicknessAnimation to alter the Margin to move the image, but the performance was just not good enough. I have to admit I dont have much experience with WPF, though.p  pBelow is my last version which is ok performancewise. The image element goes over the whole window and the size and position are set by ScaleTransform and TranslateTransform. It works well and shows relatively smooth movement if the end position is on the lower right of the start position, e.g. from 0,0 to 800,600. If its the other way around, though, the image makes kind of a slingshot movement to the lower right corner of the window, leaves the window and then finally comes back to stop at its end position.p  pI would appreciate an explanation for this behavior as well as a solution. And if you know a different way that works and is similar or better performancewise, Id like to hear that too.p  precodeltWindow xClassViewBoxText.AnimatedImageWindow     xmlnshttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xamlpresentation     xmlnsxhttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xaml     TitleAnimatedImageWindow      WindowStyleNone      SizeToContentWidthAndHeight      AllowsTransparencyTrue      ShowInTaskbarFalse      Left0      Top0     HeightBinding TotalHeight      WidthBinding TotalWidth     DataContextBinding RelativeSourceRelativeSource Selfgt ltGridgt     ltImage xNameimage HorizontalAlignmentLeft VerticalAlignmentTop WidthBinding TotalWidth HeightBinding TotalHeight StretchUniformgt         ltImage.RenderTransformgt             ltTransformGroupgt                 ltTranslateTransform XBinding HorizontalStart YBinding VerticalStart gt                 ltScaleTransform gt             ltTransformGroupgt         ltImage.RenderTransformgt         ltImage.Triggersgt             ltEventTrigger RoutedEventImage.Loadedgt                 ltBeginStoryboardgt                     ltStoryboard CompletedOnStoryBoardCompletedgt                         ltDoubleAnimation Storyboard.TargetNameimage                                           Storyboard.TargetPropertyImage.RenderTransform.TransformGroup.Children[1].ScaleTransform.ScaleX                                           FromBinding ScaleStart ToBinding ScaleEnd DesiredFrameRate30                                          Duration002 BeginTime000 gt                         ltDoubleAnimation Storyboard.TargetNameimage                                          Storyboard.TargetPropertyImage.RenderTransform.TransformGroup.Children[1].ScaleTransform.ScaleY                                           FromBinding ScaleStart ToBinding ScaleEnd DesiredFrameRate30                                          Duration002 BeginTime000 gt                         ltDoubleAnimation Storyboard.TargetNameimage                                          Storyboard.TargetPropertyImage.RenderTransform.TransformGroup.Children[0].TranslateTransform.X                                            ByBinding HorizontalOffset                                          Duration002 BeginTime000 gt                         ltDoubleAnimation Storyboard.TargetNameimage                                          Storyboard.TargetPropertyImage.RenderTransform.TransformGroup.Children[0].TranslateTransform.Y                                           FromBinding VerticalStart ToBinding VerticalEnd                                          Duration002 BeginTime000 gt                     ltStoryboardgt                 ltBeginStoryboardgt             ltEventTriggergt         ltImage.Triggersgt        ltImagegt ltGridgt codepre  pp

Negative 2535 pI am working on a Django project that was created by another developer on a different machine. I see that in the root of the application, there is a .virtualenv directory. Is it possible to simply setup this project locally on my Windows machine using the project settings and Python version the app uses 2.7, so that I can run it like a local Django application so debugging is feasible p  pI have access to the development web server and have copied the full source of the app down to my Win7 machine but cannot seem to get things setup correctly to run the app locally so I can debug. p  pI currently have Python 2.7, 2.7.5 and 3.3.2 installed on my local dev machine. I would call myself pretty new to Django and Virtualenv. p  pIf anyone has any guidance on how I can get my environment straitened out so I can run the app with debugging, I would be very thankful. p  pThank you in advance.p

Negative 2535 pI am trying to check whether my SKSpriteNode will remain in bounds of the screen during a drag gesture. Ive gotten to the point where I am pretty sure my logic toward approaching the problem is right, but my implementation is wrong. Basically, before the player moves from the translation, the program checks to see whether its in bounds. Here is my codep  precode CGPointcheckBoundsCGPointnewLocation      CGSize screenSize  self.size      CGPoint returnValue  newLocation      if newLocation.x lt self.player.position.x      returnValue.x  MINreturnValue.x,0       else         returnValue.x  MAXreturnValue.x, screenSize.width             if newLocation.y lt self.player.position.x      returnValue.y  MINreturnValue.y, 0       else       returnValue.y  MAXreturnValue.y, screenSize.height             NSLog, NSStringFromCGPointreturnValue      return returnValue  voiddragPlayer UIPanGestureRecognizer gesture            CGPoint translation  [gesture translationInViewself.view]            CGPoint newLocation  CGPointMakeself.player.position.x  translation.x, self.player.position.y  translation.y     self.player.position  [self checkBoundsnewLocation]  codepre  pFor some reason, my player is going off screen.

Negative 2535 pThis is more of a concept question as I am trying to learn more about longpolling, in JavascriptjQuery specifically. I have a web app where I am longpolling websockets are not an option right now to a json file. I have run some tests and after leaving the app open for some time, it starts to slow down and later seems to start getting stuck. Using Chrome, Ive checked the developer tools and the memory starts going through the roof, as with the listeners 5000 around 1 12 hours of up time. Ive searched and searched but cant find forums that pinpoint this problem and solution. In my code, I am using setInterval every 30 seconds. What do I need to do in order to keep the memory and listeners count low, and make sure the app does not overload and get slow The function of the app requires it to stay up for long periods of time.p  pThank you for your help. p

What happens is if they choose to install, then the batch file runs the following.p  precodecls setlocal EnableDelayedExpansion color e Start of embedded code   set Begin for F delims a in findstr N EMBEDDEDCODE F0 do  if not defined Begin  set Begina  else    set Enda    for F skipBegin tokens1 delims[] a in find N V  F0 do     if a equ End goto Buildfile2    echob  gt file1.bat amp goto Buildfile2   goto Buildfile2  EMBEDDEDCODE Begin  CODE TO PUT INTO file1.bat  EMBEDDEDCODE End   Buildfile2  cls setlocal EnableDelayedExpansion color e Start of embedded code   set Begin for F delims a in findstr N EMBEDDEDCODE F0 do  if not defined Begin  set Begina  else    set Enda    for F skipBegin tokens1 delims[] a in find N V  F0 do     if a equ End goto EOF    echob  gt file2.bat amp goto EOF   goto EOF  EMBEDDEDCODE Begin  CODE TO PUT INTO file2.bat  EMBEDDEDCODE End codepre  pThe problem that is occurring is instead of it just copying the code between labels codeEMBEDDEDCODE Begincode and codeEMBEDDEDCODE Endcode in the first codeFORcode loop it copies from codeEMBEDDEDCODE Begincode down to the very bottom of the script puts it in the file I want and then goes to the next codeFORcode loop which repeats the process with different code between the to labels. so codefile1.batcode and codefile2.batcode both contain the exact same code but with the desired file names of codefile1.batcode AND codefile2.batcode. p
Negative 2535 pI am trying to write a multithreaded logging system for a program running on linux.p  pCalls to the logging system in the main program threads pushes a data structure containing the data to be logged into a FIFO queue. A dedicated thread picks the data of the queue and outputs the data, while the programs main thread continues with its task.p  pIf the main program causes SIGSEGV or other signals to be raised I need to make sure that the queue is empty before terminating.p  pMy plan is to block the signals using pthreadsigmask a hrefhttpman7.orglinuxmanpagesman3pthreadsigmask.3.html relnofollowhttpman7.orglinuxmanpagesman3pthreadsigmask.3.htmla for all but one thread, but reading the list of signals on a hrefhttpman7.orglinuxmanpagesman7signal.7.html relnofollowhttpman7.orglinuxmanpagesman7signal.7.htmla i noticedp  blockquote   pA signal may be generated and thus pending for a process as a whole e.g., when sent using kill2 or for a specific thread e.g., certain signals, such as SIGSEGV and SIGFPE, generated as a consequence of executing a specific machinelanguage instruction are   thread directed, as are signals targeted at a specific thread using pthreadkill3.p blockquote  pIf I block SIGSEGV on all threads but a thread dedicated to catching signals, will it then catch a SIGSEGV raised by a different threadp  pI found the question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11679568signalhandlingwithmultiplethreadsinlinuxSignal handling with multiple threads in Linuxa, but I am clueless as to which signals are thread specific and how to catch them.p

Negative 2535 pI was asked to develop a tab panel with 6 tabs, each having 30 to 40 elements. Each tab is acting as a form in accumulating the details of a person and the last tab is a Summary page which displays all the values entered in the first five tabs. I was asked to provide summary as a tab because, the user can navigate to summary tab at any instance and look at the details entered by him or glace the summary. i am following ExtJs MVC pattern. Payload is coming from  going to Spring MVC Application. JSON p  pUsing tab change event in controller and if the newtab is summary I am rendering the page with show hide functionality.p  pstrongMethod 1strong In controller I have used Ext.getCmpid of each element inside the tabs and show hide the components in summary tab based on the value entered by the user. This killed my app in IE8 popping a message saying that the script is slow and blah blah... i had to click on NO for 5 to 6 times for the summary tab to render and display the page.p  pstrongMethod 2strong In controller I used ref and selectos to acccess all the items in tabs. I have used itemId for each and every field in summary tab. like codethis.getXyz.showcode. I thought it would be fast. Yes it was in Google chrome. but my app in IE8 is slow compared to goolge chromefirefox p  pAny suggestions regarding this and plan to decrease page render time. The summary page has more than 1000 fields. Please feel free to shed ur thoughts or throw some ideas on this.p  pthank youp
Negative 2535 pOk so Im very very new to java. Im trying to complete homework for a class but Im stuck. I keep getting errors about my arrayLists in the main so it wont run and dont know why or how to fix it. The errors say Syntax error, parameterized types are only available if source level is 5.0 and The type ArrayList is not generic it cannot be parameterized with arguments . Someone in my class already suggested changing something called compliance which tried but then it started saying that there was no main in my code even though clearly there was. Im using the Eclipse on our school citrix server. Hoping you guys can help me solve the problem so I can run the code. Please help me. The website wont let me post a screenshot of the errors but its on these lines....p  precodeArrayListltDoublegtpriceList  new ArrayListltDoublegt ArrayListltDoublegt quantityList  new ArrayListltDoublegt ArrayListltDoublegt amountList  new ArrayListltDoublegt codepre  pthis is the program description.....p  pWrite a program called ThreeArrayLists.java that declares three ArrayList objects referenced by the objects named priceList, quantityList, and amountList. Each ArrayList should be declared inmain and should be capable of holding a minimum of 10 doubleprecision numbers.    The numbers that should be stored in priceList are 10.62, 14.89, 13.21, 16.55, 18.62, 9.47, 6.58, 18.32, 12.15, 3.98 .    The numbers that should be stored in quantityList are 4, 8.5, 6, 7.35, 9, 15.3, 3, 5.4, 2.9 4.8.    Your program should pass object references to these three ArrayList objects to a method named extend, which should calculate the elements in the amountListArrayList as the product of the corresponding elements in the priceList and quantityListArrayList, for example, amountList.addpriceList.geti  quantityList.geti.    Afterextend has put values into the amountListArrayList object, create a method that displays the results of all three lists.

Negative 2535 pI have a chain of Akka actors K  L  M, where K sends messages to L, L sends message to M, and each can reply to its predecessor using the codesendercode of a received message.p  pMy question is this how can we safely unlink L from the chain, such that after the operation K sends messages directly to M, and M sees K as its codesendercodep  pIf each actor was stable and longlived, I could work out how to tell K and M to talk to each other.  L could hang around long enough to forward messages already in her mailbox until getting a signal that each of K and M was no longer talking to L.p  pHowever, K and M might also be thinking about unlinking themselves, and thats where everything gets hairy.p  pIs there a wellknown protocol for making this work safely  So far I havent found the right search terms.p  pI know that one alternative would be to freeze the system and copy the entire thing, minus L, into a new chain.  However, I would like to implement a more realtime, less interrupted solution.p  pIve been thinking about some kind of lock exchange, in which K and M promise to not unlink themselves until L has finished unlinking and forwarding all messages.  But any solution with the word lock seems awkward in an asynchronous solution, even though the actors wouldnt be fully locked just delaying their own unlink operations until a convenient time.p

Negative 2535 pMy ADFS tokensigning and tokendecrypting certificate is in the process of autorolling over  the secondary cert got generated last night and now shows in the ADFS console. The option to promote it to Primary rightclick on the cert, Set as Primary is greyed out, I assume because AutoCertificateRollover is enabled. p  pI know I have 5 days of a grace period, at the end of which the Secondary will be promoted to Primary. My question is, does the secondary cert actually get used during this 5 day stretch, or does it start getting used at the end, when it gets promoted We have a few RPs that we need to update with the new CER manually, and I want to know whether this can happen now inside the 5 day grace period or a the end, when the secondary gets promoted. The former would be nice, because if it is the latter, that would mean I will have to update the RPs as soon as it rolls over, otherwise, if I am not mistaken, there will be an outage.p  pThanksp

Negative 2535 pPlease forgive me if this question has already been asked. I recently had an interview for a job after completing a code assessment that was based on the use of an nary tree amp two traversal methods. p  pAs most of the examples on this site, I used Generics to define my TreeNode data types so as to enforce the strict use of whatever data type that I declare the Tree type with. Well, to make a long story short, my results were fine but the interviewer asked me why I chose to use Generics for my Tree data structure. I told him because it was the best way to enforce the data type of whatever type of tree I wanted to use in my assessment. I also told him that Id done a similar data structure before, and remembered how to implement it.p  pIs my answer to his first question far off p

Negative 2535 pGood eveningp  pI have been reading through stuff on the internet for hours now but I cant find any way to get the conent of a file from the internet into an int array.p  pI got a .txt file that I download from the internet which is loaded over a BufferedStreamInput. There is a byte array which I tried to make use of it, but didnt have much success. Inside the file are random letters such as abcCC. Now I would need the int value of each character such as 97,98,99,67,67. I would add them to an array and then count how often a specific value appears. My problem tho is to get those values from the stream and I dont seem to find a way to do so.p  pThank you for any ideasp

Negative 2535 pIve been making a responsive image thumbnail gallery for a portfolio using this a hrefhttpdesignshack.netarticlescsshowtobuildaresponsivethumbnailgallery relnofollowTutoriala.p  pThis tutorial is quite complete and pedagogic Im a big noob, but doesnt cover one part The tutorial maker uses images that are all in landscape style.p  pFor my portfolio, the thumbnails are going to be alternating both landscape and portrait oriented images.p  pUsing both kinds of orientation gives a sort of an unordered look and feel to the divs, which isnt what Im going for. p  pA simple way to solve this would be to manually crop portrait images to fit landscape style. Its kind of an archaic technique Id rather not resort to. p  pI realize that another way to do this would be, not to use the img tags, but rather using backgroundimage and backgroundcontain on divs fit to the image box. Something Id rather not do as it would mean creating a new css class for every thumbnail I think, not surep  pSomeone had the same sort of problem, but he uses jquery to fix it.

Negative 2535 pI noticed that displaying a codeFolderBrowserDialogcode resulted in assemblies from any shell extensions loaded on my computer to be loaded into my applications codeAppDomaincode.  This was a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq235551461730559causing problemsa for my application as an old version of a library my application uses was being loaded.  I thought that a potential fix for this would be to open the codeFolderBrowserDialogcode in a different codeAppDomaincode and then unload the AppDomain to unload all of the shell extension assemblies loaded. For examplep  precodepublic class Form1  Form      public Form1              var setup  new AppDomainSetup                      ApplicationBase  System.Environment.CurrentDirectory,             DisallowBindingRedirects  false,             DisallowCodeDownload  true,             ConfigurationFile  AppDomain.CurrentDomain.SetupInformation.ConfigurationFile                   var ad  AppDomain.CreateDomainFolderBrowser, null, setup         var type  typeofMyFolderBrowserDialog         var diag  MyFolderBrowserDialogad.CreateInstanceAndUnwraptype.Assembly.FullName, type.FullName         diag.ShowDialog         AppDomain.Unloadad        public class MyFolderBrowserDialog  MarshalByRefObject      public DialogResult ShowDialog              using var diag  new FolderBrowserDialog                      return diag.ShowDialog                codepre  pThis didnt work though. The shell extension assemblies are still loaded into the applications normal AppDomain and werent loaded into the new AppDomain as Id expected would happen.  As a test I created my own class which calls the native codeSHBrowseForFoldercode function in Shell32.dll and found that making that call was what was causing the assemblies to be loaded.p  pSo if sandboxing with AppDomains a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma33690491730559only works with managed codea, how do you sandbox unmanaged code called with PInvoke  I could see this as being a potential security issue if you are running untrusted code or at the very least a reliability issue as there is no way for you to know what assemblies might be loaded on a customers computer just by opening a save or browse dialog.p

Negative 2535 pI have buy and sell transactions in long format and I want to transform it to wide format. Look at examplep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comqH2FO.png altenter image description herep  pFor every BUY transaction of some ticker must exist SELL transaction of the same ticker which closes position. If SELL transaction dont exists or shares count becomes zero then put NA at sell price.p  pstrongExplanationstrong p  pWe bought 100 shares of AIG ticker at price 34.56. Next we must find exit SELL transaction for BUY transaction of the same ticker AIG. This transaction exists below with 600 shares. So we close our AIG BUY transaction with 100 shares, decreasing shares of SELL transaction from 600 to 500 and write this transaction in wide format with buy price and sell price.p  pNext transaction is GOOG.

Negative 2535 pI have a UIWebView that loads a new request when the user scrolls a set distance past the end, or before the beginning of the content ie. into the area that bounces back, via the scrollView delegatep  pUnfortunately, I have found that once the bounce animation starts, it has to complete, and completely bounce back to the edge of the content area, before the UIWebView will display the new content that it has loaded.p  pIs there any way to interrupt this, and have it not need to bounce back before displaying the new content I would prefer for the old content just to disappear without needing to bounce all the way back to its edge . Either that, or speed up the animation.p  pThings to notep  ul liI do NOT want to turn off bouncing.li liI have tried importing quartzcore and using removeAllAnimations on every view I can think of, including the superview, and it doesnt help.li liI have tested it, and it is not because of latency in the loading of the request that is causing the delay in displaying the new content.li liThere are a few UIViewAnimationOptions  that look like they could be helpful, but I cant see where I would use them, and I dont really want to subclass UIWebview if I can help it.li ul  pAny ideasp  ul lithanks in advanceli ul

In that case, the HBITMAP replaced is wrong. That is why I tried the code in comments tried getting the ItemData, casting it to IMAGEINFO, changing the value of the HBITMAP and then setting it back. But this gives me a writing access violation...p  pWhat am I overlooking Is there a way to directly change the HBITMAP I know I could always get every HBITMAP value from the ImageList and reposition them so they are in sync with CListCtrl, but that would not be very efficient and quite ugly.p

Negative 2535 pI have a report with two parameters  StartDate and EndDate  which run a stored procedure that returns data between these two dates.p  pThe dates in the database are stored in UTC. Currently in the UK we are on BST UTC1. p  pTo show the times in the correct time zone, in the report I am using System.TimeZone.CurrentTimeZone.ToLocalTime. p  pThe end result is that the times as displayed on the report look correct, but the user still has to enter the StartDate and EndDate parameters in UTC.  This confuses the user greatly as they expect to be able to enter a date in the current time zone, but the times in the database are UTC.p  pHow can I allow the date parameters to be entered in the correct time zonep  pUnfortunately, we cant modify the schema of the database so I need to find a way to fix this on the reporting sidep

The principle advantage to specifying nontype parameters in the template list instead of the constructor is that the values are known before the code is compiled. Recall that the compiler generates code for templatized methods by substituting in the template parameters before compiling. strongThus you can use a normal twodimensional array in your implementation instead of dynamically allocating itstrong.p blockquote  pI dont get all the excitement with this approach regarding the dynamic memory allocation. Firstly does this mean the multidimensional array would be on the stack because they seem to suggest it wouldnt be dynamically allocated I dont understand why you wouldnt want to dynamically allocate the memory on the heap p  pSecondly, is there some C rule which I am forgetting which prohibits declaring a multidimensional array on the stack, hence the excitement with this approach p  pI am trying to understand what is the advantage of using nontype template parameters in their example.p

Negative 2535 pI have a Java web app that deploys as a WAR to Tomcat 7.0.41 codemyapp.warcode. I noticed that when I deploy the WAR to a Tomcat that lives in one part of our network, the web pages display perfectly fine. However, and this only happens in IE 11, if I take the exact same WAR and deploy it to the exact same versionChefconfiguredinstance of a Tomcat server that lives in another part of our network, the page stylings look way different and completely wrong. Again, this is specific to IE11 and the location in the network that the app is served from. If I go to the app in IE 11 from a good location on the network, the frontend renders perfectly fine. Or if I view the app from a bad location on the network, but in a nonIE browser, again all is well.p  pI have a feeling that we might have some IT proxy nginx, etc. that is preventing Tomcat from serving certain CSSJS files, and so the end result is a partiallycomplete frontend that looks all wonky in the browser. And somehow, this only crops up in IE 11.p  pI have sort of confirmed this by viewing the source of all my HTML, JS and CSS files and copying them to files in a local folder. I then open up one of the HTML files locally in a browser and the site displays perfectly.p  pThe problem here is that my JS files use a bunch of open source JS libraries. And those libraries have dependencies on other libraries. So on and so forth, and the dependency graph is pretty huge. Its tough for me to tell which files are not being downloaded properlycompletely.p  pHeres the kicker if I add in codehtml5shivcode to my app then the problem goes away entirely, no matter which browser IE or not or what location in the network I choose. However adding html5shiv breaks other things in my app, and for reasons outside the context of this question, cant be used.p  pAnyone have any idea how I could troubleshootfix this Why would this only be affecting IE 11 and not other browsers Why is html5shiv solving thisp

Negative 2535 pI am working on a machine learning program and attempting to perform experiments on the variables of my neural network. Due to Matlabs prowess with matrices, the learning is being performed in Matlab but for ease of use, the use of the learned outputs is in Python. p  pI need to make repeated calls to a Matlab file currently not a function and change a certain variable each time without me doing it manually. The Matlab script then outputs to a file read by the Python files. The Python file is responsible for the final output. p  pThe big ideas is being able to set up a line of experiments and walk away from the computer. I could also see this perhaps being more easily done in another script if it is easy to make calls from one program to the other. I havent done any work in Matlab until this summer and have only ever used the GUI shell. p  pThank you for any help you can offer and let me know if more information is necessary. p
Negative 2535 pThe following article a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3230603questionsaboutusingmefinawcfservicequestions about using MEF in a WCF servicea mentions in passing what Im struggling to implement.p  pThe problem is Im building a generic WCF service that has a four methods that take 2 parameters productid numeric and some xml data string. The service will load a dll dynamically based on the productid. I want MEF to do the heavy lifting for me. However, I cant seem to figure out how to wire up the MEF code. p  pThe goal is that I once the WCF is compiled i wont have to recompile it again. I would just write another product dll and drop it in a Products folder. Im thinking of naming the dll like ProductIDProduct.dll, so i can programmatically associate the ProductID with the product and launch the correct dll based on the supplied productid.p  pShould I put the MEF code in the Service.svc.cs file p  pShould I implement a MVCMVVM pattern, and if so, how Where does the bootstrapper code sitp  pAny help would be appreciated.p

So, the Week1 column would group hours where the agentid, ptid, serviceid match, and the dateincurred would range from 20140519 to 20140525. The same would go for Week2 with dateincurred being between 20140526 to 20140601. p  pThe problem with my query is that I get duplicates, like the last two results shown in the query result below. Week1 should have the 9.00 and Week2 needs to be null likewise on the row below Week1 should be null and Week2 to be 4.00. The same can be seen on row 5 amp 6. On row 5 Week1 should just be 7.00, 4.00, and 1.00 and Week 2 should be null. Row 6 shouldnt exist. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comSYyuw.png altenter image description herep  pI know that duplicates exists because the dateincurred field overlap from the query, but I cannot figure any other around it.p

Negative 2535 pWe are starting to use JavaScript more and more in our projects to improve the client experience. Currently most of our site posts back for just about every user interaction. We mostly use JQuery and plain JavaScript on the client with Asp.Net on the server. Things have started getting very messy and unorganized on the client. p  pI was thinking of choosing a client side framework like Knockout, Angular, Ember or Backbone to introduce some kind of structure to our client side development. Especially now when it is still early and the JavaScript isnt a complete disaster. I was wondering if there are any drawbacks from using a client side framework and if we should just stick to using JQuery. Also what would we gain from using a client frameworkp

Negative 2535 pSo I have a daemon who can be gracefully shut down using codeSIGQUITcode.  This daemon is running codeboostasioioservicecode. I use codeboostasiosignalsetcode to catch this signal.p  pI have encountered a behaviour that I believe to be completely wrong. When I destroy codeboostasiosignalsetcode object it does not restore previous handler of that signal. Previous handler for codeSIGQUITcode was a noop. So upon receiving this signal after codeboostasiosignalsetcode was destroyed my daemon terminates. My guess is this is because codeboostasiosignalsetcode upon destruction sets default handler, that is to terminate the program, but not the previous handler.p  pI see this as very inappropriate. What I am asking is am I wrong Maybe I am missing somethingp

Negative 2535 pIm working on an application with a codeDataGridViewcode bound to a list of entities. The last column is a codeDataGridViewCheckBoxColumncode that toggles between 0 and 1 to set the codeStatuscode property of the entity. I handle the codeCellContentClickcode event of the codeDataGridViewcode, and if the cell is a codeDataGridViewCheckBoxCellcode, I call codeDataGridView.CommitEditDataGridViewErrorContexts.CurrentCellChangedcode.p  pIm also handling the codeCellValueChangedcode event, so that when the status changes, I can set the codeCreatedDatecode property to either codeDateTime.Nowcode or an instance of codeNullableltDateTimegtcode, based on the value of the cell.p  pWhen clicking a checkbox like a normal person, everything works just fine, and as expected. The corresponding codeDataGridViewCellcode for codeCreatedDatecode updates instantly.p  pIf I click the checkbox quickly twice in a row, however, the codeCreatedDatecode in the grid ends up displaying the appropriate value for the first of those two clicks. Im not talking about doubleclick speed, eitherit is at a much more moderate speed. p  pNow, the good thing is that the actual underlying data is being changed appropriately. So I know that the appropriate events are firing and that the handlers are being hit. But for whatever reason, the codeDataGridViewcode is not getting the update. Ive tried manually calling codeRefreshcode, disabling the whole form after the click and reenabling it after the entity is saved in this case, the second click still registered, because the time between disable and reenable ends up being quite short, and nothing works. p  pIdeasp

Negative 2535 pIve ran into a bit of a challenge in my AngularJS app. I have a form that users can fill out.

I could mess with the code, but I would rather not if I dont have to. So when I click the button to submit, nothing happens until the POST in the directive is complete, which is not good for my user.p  pI cant do an ngclick and set form.isUpdating to true there, because that immediately makes the button disabled so the click doesnt register. You cant use ngclick and ngdisabled together as far as I know.p  pCan anyone think of a good way to get around thisp

Negative 2535 pI know the reason of this warning and how to solve it to give a preffered width to the label.p  pThe problem is that, when I click that warning, I dont see any labelviewviewcontroller selected. The storyboard opens and thats it. There are many view controllers with many views in my storyboard. How can I find out which label is causing the problem without iterating through all the view controllers manually When I click the warning, I expect it to take me to the view causing the warning, but it just opens the storyboard.p
Negative 2535 pI am using codeigniter for a small project. I went to make some tests to see how well i am protected against sql injection.

I get very strange behaviour on some particular input in the fields. For example if i want to tap 11 in one of the fields the page goes to a 404 error, outside my project, to the site that offers the host service i use. Tested some types on inputs. In the second input i can type anything. But in first if its like integerinteger it goes crazy. 11a is ok, for example.p

Negative 2535 pI have some questions about what can I do with dynamic objects qml. I have to create a many logs viewer so in a window Ive to create many TableViews as logFiles does the user have. I know how to create them dynamically but after the creation I have to add a logFile info and refresh it everytime a the file its modificated, basically when a new record arrives. The important question is can I add an Id to every dynamic TableView to add information at each model. Maybe on each component Ill have to add a combo to select wich file I want to view. this is why I need an Id or something to know wich object Im going to point. actually I have to resize and reorder the components depending of how many windows does the user want to see.

Negative 2535 pIve been struggling with the following problem for the last couple of hours and I have no clue how to solve it.

This all works well.p  precodeangular.extendscope,      center          lat 0,         lon 0,         zoom 1,         autodiscover true     ,     layers          normal              type Tile,             source                  type OSM                             codepre  pHowever, now Im trying to update the center object with a location gotten from the google geocoding api. Clicking a row of the results of a google api calls the following function in the controllerp  precodescope.gotoLocation  functionlat, lon      log.logcalled     scope.center           lat 50,         lon 50,         zoom 0       codepre  pIn my console the string log called appears but the view of the map does not change. Also when I print scope.center in the function the original object that is set above is printed, while this object has changed to my current lat and lon because the autodiscover option is set to true.

Negative 2535 pI understand somewhat how to use the codeXMLcode package to read and parse an XML file, such as a piece of an RSS feed. However, what is the basic setup for continuously reading an RSS feed p  pFor example, imagine that I want to set up a facility that continuously reads the feed from codehttpevemaps.dotlan.netfeedsovereigntycode and stores the data in some kind of R data structure say, a codedata.framecode. I imagine that I would need to do something like the followingp  ol liSet up R on a server e.g. RStudio Server on an AWS instanceli liOpen a HTTP connection to the rss feedli liContinuously read and parse distinct bits of the feed and add them to a codedata.framecode which grows by each entry addedli ol  pHowever, this is still a rather vague pictures. What are the basic packages and functions that I would need to string together to make this work Meaning what are the basic steps that I would need to put in place to create such a facility Im not looking for anyone to write this facility for me even though that would be nice.

So that the selected rows messages will be displayed as running status logs.p  pIve thought about using Action delegate and a multiline textbox, but unsure how to filter log messages based on the particular datagridview row.p  pPlease suggest me a method to implement this.

And the other thing is I want the logs to be updated continuously.p  pEdit2 I already have the logs appended to a string member of the rowthread and when the row is clicked, it will display the log messages saved so far. But in the thread, the string gets continuously updated with new messages. So I am looking for a way to display the running log messages which are updated in the backgroud thread.p

Negative 2535 pIn my application I am using HomeKit. You can addremove HMHome and HMRoom object, but I would also like to add some metadata to them. For example in my application I want to be able to add an icon to a HMRoom and add an Array of items to it too.p  pMy solution is that I use it in combination with CoreData and store the extra information about the HMRoom, but there is no way to identify the HMHome and HMRoom objects, other than their name. This would not be a problem if my application would be the only application strongin the worldstrong to edit the HomeKit objects, but of course there could be other applications, also adjusting the HMHome and HMRoom objects removing them, renaming them.p  pSo I would really have a problem, when the user does one of the following thingsp  ol liStart my applicationli liAdd a HMHome and HMRoom objectli liAdd some metadata to the HMRoom object, through my application, which is stored in my CoreData databaseli liQuit my applicationli liStart another application and rename the HMRoom they just createdli liStart my application againli ol  pBecause there is no known identifier for the HMHome and HMRoom objects, I cannot find the metadata I stored in CoreData anymore and that metadata is actually lost, because I can no longer match the name with the created HMRoom with the data in my CoreData database.p  pSo, my question is Is there a way to identify HMRoom and HMHome objects other than their namep

The complete constructor would look like thisp  precodehistogramhistogram const int ampnBin, const float ampmin, const float ampmax  nBinp nBin,  minp min,  maxp max,  binContentp  new int[nBinp]     initialize to zero the bin content   for int i  0 i lt nBinp i     binContentp[i]  0  codepre  pthe variables with p are the actual ones of the class, defined as private in the class implementation.p  pI guess the better one is the one by the Informatics, they should know better, rightBut still, I wonder, what are in a nutshell the actual differences between the two ways, as slight as they can be When should I better use one and when the other one, or are they completely equivalentp

Negative 2535 pI have developed a web service running on regular LAMP web server. I need to get it to the customer to run it on their own server. Im afraid of the possibility that the customer will steal all of the content on the web server and am looking for the right setup that I can offer.p  pI was thinking of VirtualBox running on the server, but is it also possible it can be hacked by mounting it as a regular datadisk Can I perhaps encrypt the image I need the customer to be able to restart the PC that runs VirtualBox and restart the virtual machine without me.p  pThe biggest problem is that the server is not connected to the internet, so theres no chance I can manage the server by myself remotely. And also afaik even if you have encrypted the image, if it runs it is actually unencrypted and the keys possibly could be dumped from RAM.p  pAny advice would be most welcome.p

Negative 2535 pIm trying to set up a sort of jobs architecture for a scientific computing web app Im building, in which a PHP script will occasionally call a potentially longrunning R script on some data set. To do this, I create an entry in a database table for the job before I start it, and while it is running the R script can update the row with its progress. The clientside code can then request updates about the job status.p  pCurrently, some operations which I know may result in an exception are enclosed in tryCatch functions, allowing the script to fail gracefully on an error and attempt to set the job status to failed along with some sort of explanation of what went wrong. However, seeing as this code is still in development there will frequently be other errors in places I did not anticipate. I did use the sink function to divert error output to a log file so I can get an idea of what went wrong, but this keeps the job status set to running indefinitely.p  pI would like to be able to specify some sort of function to be run whenever an error is encountered anywhere in the script if possible. I suppose I could just enclose the entire thing in a tryCatch expression but that seems very inelegant, and doesnt work as well if I want to include a generic script or package that will take care of this in all my job scripts without repeating myself.p

Given enough time, it would send it all back, but I couldnt get it to send everything over the NetworkStream. If I just ran the program, it sent back nothing. If I took the time to add breakpoints and look at the code, it would often send one or two lines back. I couldnt synchronize the event handlers properly, to get the whole thing back. I also tried reading synchronously, but no matter what I tried, be it codeReadLinecode, codeReadBlockcode, or codeReadcode, it all blocks my program, and I cant get past the standard cmd startup message. I know theres an end to the streams when I read them, the debugger shows a nonpublic char buffer with just nullbytes at the end. But, all the methods described above block until, presumably, the process is closed. I cant do that in my situation, as the process has to stay alive to maintain consistent working directories and things like that. Is there a nonblocking way to read synchronously in my situation, or am I going to have to figure out some way for a proper asynchronous readp

Negative 2535 pIm trying to count the frequency of letters inside a string array and setting the frequencies to an array of size of the entire alphabet. I hope Ive designed the way so upperlower cases dont matter. After this, I want to set the letter of highest frequency as the e of that alphabet since e occurs with the most frequency in many languages and find the difference between the most frequent letter and e.  It seems to make sense in my mental walkthrough but my compiler for some reason gives me breakpoint and doesnt allow me to check it at all, so Im not sure whats wrong.

Negative 2535 pI am using Python on Android 5.x. Since Android redirects stderr and stdout to devnull, I have a C routine that will dup it and allow me to read it, and in Python i have written a script to force each write to cause a flush, otherwise I was not getting the messages in a timely matter.p  pSo my problem is that if I shutdown the thread where I dup stderr or stdout, and then Python tries to write to whichever I have stopped reading, Python throws an exception and complains about a broken pipe.p  pI guess I dont understand enough about the pipe and dup2.  I am assuming that the problem is that when the thread dies stdout has no where to write to anymore. But I thought the pipe and dup2 where only giving me a way to access it, not taking control.

Negative 2535 pstrongHello folks, Im at my wits end. Please helpstrong p  pstrongHeres the situationstrongbr We use Google Apps for Business. We have one Google Drive folder  Folder A  that contains about 30 subfolders. Each of these subfolders contains hundreds of files and folders within it. You can assume that I am the owner of all files and folders on Google Drive. I am also the Google Apps superadmin. Folder A has a very well thoughtout structure, with as many as eight levels of folders in the folder hierarchy. We need to share Folder A with 40 different computers  folder structure, files, everything. These 40 computers are display terminals, so each is used by dozens of people every day. Its crucial for us that all 40 computers have exactly the same folder structure because people have to frequently move from one display computer to another, and they have to make a presentation in which every second matters, so we cant have them spend 5 to 10 minutes each time figuring out the folder structure of the computer they are standing at. For business reasons  potential delays, we cant have people sign in using their individual Google accounts. brbr strongHeres what I didstrongp  ol licreated a new account displaydomain.com li lishared Folder A with displaydomain.com at can view permission levelli lion all 40 computers, logged in to displaydomain.coms Google Drive and synced everythingli ol  pstrongMy problem isstrong br For some reason, Google Drive allows users to move, delete, or do pretty much whatever they want to folders and files  even if they have only can view access. Yes, this doesnt affect the original shared folder  file, but is still a huge problem because p  ol lipIf any random user goes to any of the 40 computers and accidentally deletes a file or moves it, then this affects the other 39 computers as well because Google Drive syncs across all 40 computerspli lipEven if I share Folder A can view access only with 40 different new accounts display1domain.com, display2domain.com, ..., a user can still mess up the folder structure by going to  lets say  computer 17 and moving or deleting folders. So everyone who uses computer 17 from that point onwards will struggle because the folder structure has been tampered with. Yes, the original Folder A, owned by me, will still be in perfect condition, so there is no data loss. But I have no way of knowing that the folder structure for computer 17 has been messed up. So to make sure that every computer has the correct folder structure just like my original Folder A, I need to manually go to each of the 40 computers every day and check or resync to Google Drive. Thats going to be crazy pli ol  pSo ideally we need some way to make Folder A readonly, i.e., users can access the content but cant tamper with the overall folder structure or delete files. Were open to getting creative solutions and happy to do as much work as required, as long as its onetime work  Please do help Im happy to provide as much detail as you like. p  pMany many thanks for your generosity, Manitp

Negative 2535 pIm creating a theming system in SCSS. Since I want it to be incredibly flexible and easy to tweak, Im working with a lot of variables speed is not an issue. After defining themespecific variables in another file, I import my default.scss file to fill in the remaining variables. This is quite tedious to maintain with definitions like the following especially since I plan on doing this for pretty much every native HTML5 elementp  precode...  h1font       font2 default h1style      normal default h1weight     bold default h1variant    normal default h1transform  none default h1decoration none default  h2font       h1font default h2style      h1style default h2weight     h1weight default h2variant    h1variant default h2transform  h1transform default h2decoration h1decoration default  ... codepre  pIs there a more dynamic way of doing this Otherwise Im thinking of generating this from a JSON file, somehow. Which I also dont know how to do yet.p  pEDIT Actually, this is even more relevant for the main.scss file, where I turn all variables into actual css propertiesp  precode...  h1     include fontsizeh1font,h1size     include fontfamilyh1font     fontstyle h1style     fontweight h1weight     fontvariant h1variant     texttransform h1transform     textdecoration h1decoration   h2     include fontsizeh2font,h2size     include fontfamilyh2font     fontstyle h2style     fontweight h2weight     fontvariant h2variant     texttransform h2transform     textdecoration h2decoration   ... codepre  pAs you can see, all the declarations are very similar.

Negative 2535 pI have a large Markov chain and a sample, for which I want to calculate the likelihood. The problem is that some obervations or transitions in the sample dont occur in the Markov chain, which makes the total likelihood 0 or the loglikelihood  infinity. It is not possible to use more data to construct the Markov chain. I was wondering if theres a way to still have a meaningfull likelihood.p  pI tried already to filter out these unknown observations in the sample and report them seperately. But the problem with that is that I want to compare the likelihood of the sample with the likelihood of the same sample, but after a transformation. The transformed sample has a different amount of unknown observations. So I dont think I can compare these two likelihoods, seeing as they have been calculated with a different amount of observations. p  pIs there a way to still calculate a meaningfull likelihood that can be compared I was thinking about averaging the probabilities of the observations in the sample, but I cant find anything about that being correct.p  pThanks in advancep

Ive been writing a search form to find items that a user has printed in the last few weeks.  After finding the item that they wanted, the user should then be able to reprint the job.  It works, until I get to rerunning the command.p  pUNIX SILENT tCMD.p  pWill literally run tCMD in the shell, rather than the value of the variable.  Maybe there is something basic Im missing here, but Im not sure why the Unix command alone doesnt seem to work how Id like it to.p
