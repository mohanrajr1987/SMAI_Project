Positive 80 pUsing PHPRedis and Apache PHPFPM Im using the pconnect call to reuse connections  its been helpful in past to not let the number of connections creep up too high.

Negative 80 pWhat are the various options to implement a pointertomember construct in CCLIp  pI have implemented some 2D geometry algorithms which perform some actions based on X and Y coordinates. I find that I am frequently duplicating code once for the Xaxis and once for the Yaxis. An example is finding the maximum and minimum bounds along each axis.p  pHad I been using native C, I could have used a pointer to the X or Y member also width, height and so on and passed it in as a parameter so that I need implement each algorithm only once. But with CCLI, this is not possible. What are my options I am looking for something efficient, lightweight and terse.p

Negative 80 pHow would you mathematically model the distribution of repeated real life performance measurements  Real life meaning you are not just looping over the code in question, but it is just a short snippet within a large application running in a typical user scenariop  pMy experience shows that you usually have a peak around the average execution time that can be modeled adequately with a Gaussian distribution. In addition, theres a long tail containing outliers  often with a multiple of the average time. The behavior is understandable considering the factors contributing to first execution penalty. p  pstrongMy goalstrong is to model aggregate values that reasonably reflect this, and can be calculated from aggregate values like for the Gaussian, calculate mu and sigma from N, sum of values and sum of squares. In other terms, number of repetitions is unlimited, but memory and calculation requirements should be minimized. p  pA normal Gaussian distribution cant model the long tail appropriately and will have the average biased strongly even by a very small percentage of outliers. p  pstrongI am looking forstrong ideas, especially if this has been attemptedanalysed before. Ive checked various distributions models, and I think I could work out something, but my statistics is rusty and I might end up with an overblown solution. Oh, a complete shrinkwrapped solution would be fine, too  p  pstrongOther aspects  ideasstrong Sometimes you get two humps distributions, which would be acceptable in my scenario with a single musigma covering both, but ideally would be identified separately. p  pExtrapolating this, another approach would be a floating probability density calculation that uses only a limited buffer and adjusts automatically to the range due to the long tail, bins may not be spaced evenly  havent found anything, but with some assumptions about the distribution it should be possible in principle.p  hr  pstrongWhystrong since it was asked  p  pFor a complex process we need to make guarantees such as only 0.1 of runs exceed a limit of 3 seconds, and the average processing time is 2.8 seconds. The performance of an isolated piece of code can be very different from a normal runtime environment involving varying levels of disk and network access, background services, scheduled events that occur within a day, etc. p  pThis can be solved trivially by accumulating emallem data. However, to accumulate this data in production, the data produced  needs to be limited. For analysis of isolated pieces of code, a gaussian deviation plus first run penalty is ok. That doesnt work anymore for the distributions found above. p  pstrong[edit]strong Ive already got very good answers and finally  maybe  some time to work on this. Im starting a bounty to look for more input  ideas.p

Negative 80 pImagine you have an address book card. Normally the fields are displayed as static text, in a specific layout imagine having multiple phone numbers, emails etc.. When editing it, you want to use the same layout, but with form fields instead of static text. It seems that the normal way of doing this in Django is to use separate views and templates, which forces you to duplicate all of the layout markup ie, its not DRY, and to change pages to switch between browsing and editing mode.p  pIt would be nicer if you could switch in and out of editing mode on the fly, using JavaScript to replace the static text with form fields and vice versa, and Ajax to send changes to the server. Im calling this live editing, but perhaps there is a better term. At any rate, is there a recommended way of doing this in Djangop  pI was thinking of rendering, for each field, both a static and an editable version, and using JavaScript to hide and show them as needed. But I also need to update the static fields with new data from the server, and I need to take into account inline forms, and complex fields such as images where the static display is an codeltimggtcode tag, and you have to update the src after an upload. And I might also need to add and remove fields or fieldsets dynamically again, consider inline formsets.p  pAll in all, itll take a lot of code. Is there an existing solution for Django, or a recommended approach Otherwise, which JavaScript framework might be most helpful for thisp

So we have a FunctionalityStatus table with foreign keys to ApplicationInstance amp Functionality. p  pI think this is kind of bad design  why do we have multiple reference to Application What guarantees that both will point to the same Application Or is there any way to ensure thisp  pSo my proposition of fix is to connect FunctionalityStatus with foreign keys to Machines amp Functionality. But in this case they define ApplicationInstance so what is the guarantee of having ApplicationInstance for each pair Shouldnt they be connected somehow In the real world connection exists and is obvious, so is it OK not to have it in databasep  pIs there a propper way of solving this problem, or of ensuring connections invisible from data designp  pTo make it more clear I prepared design of DB that I have now img srchttpimg6.imageshack.usimg67479dbexample.png altDB designp  pThe only thing that is missing is a connection from FunctionalityStatus to Machine. I see two ways ow making such a connectionp  ol liAdd foreign key to ApplicationInstance  then my doubts are ul liHow to make sure that ApplicationId from Functionality is the same that one from ApplicationInstanceli liIsn this data duplication really neededli ulli liAdd foreign key to Machine  and doubts ul liWill there be a propper ApplicationInstance record for every FunctionalityStatus recordli liIf there is an obvious connection between ApplicationInstance and FunctionalityStatus mentioned in first doubt whu cant we see it in databaseli liAgain data redundancy becouse all ApplicationInstance records are or should be visible in FunctionalityStatus tableli ulli ol  pOr maybe the whole design is screwed up and I should figure out something totally elsep

Negative 80 pI am seriously at a loss here. The three things that will not change in this project are the fact that we are using the Entity Framework to do our data access, the fact that we want thorough unit testing and that our UI is asp.net. My question is how the hell do you make this work in Asp.netp  pE.g. You can use an ObjectDataSource to connect a method to a control, but if this control is a FormView you have all these problems a hrefhttpvaultofthoughts.netProblemsWithObjectDataSource.aspx relnofollowhttpvaultofthoughts.netProblemsWithObjectDataSource.aspxa to deal with and it simply doesnt work.p  pFurthermore, with grids, you dont get paging or sorting out of the box unless you use an EntityDataSource which basically circumvents your entire application. I cant be the only person who cries at this. What do you dop  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 80 pI was reading about a hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenHTTPaccesscontrolCORSa and I think the implementation is both simple and effective.p  pHowever, unless Im missing something, I think theres a big part missing from the spec. As I understand, its the foreign site that decides, based on the origin of the request and optionally including credentials, whether to allow access to its resources. This is fine.p  pBut what if malicious code on the page wants to POST a users sensitive information to a foreign site The foreign site is obviously going to authenticate the request. Hence, again if Im not missing something, CORS actually makes it easier to steal sensitive information.p  pI think it would have made much more sense if the original site could also supply an immutable list of servers its page is allowed to access. p  pSo the expanded sequence would bep  p1 Supply a page with list of acceptable CORS servers abc.com, xyz.com, etc 2 Page wants to make an XHR request to abc.com  the browser allows this because its in the allowed list and authentication proceeds as normal 3 Page wants to make an XHR request to malicious.com  request rejected locally ie by the browser because the server is not in the list.p  pI know that malicious code could still use JSONP to do its dirty work, but I would have thought that a complete implementation of CORS would imply the closing of the script tag multisite loophole.p  pI also checked out the official CORS spec httpwww.w3.orgTRcors and could not find any mention of this issue.p

Negative 80 pI am doing some performance critical work in C, and we are currently using integer calculations for problems that are inherently floating point because its faster. This causes a whole lot of annoying problems and adds a lot of annoying code.p  pNow, I remember reading about how floating point calculations were so slow approximately circa the 386 days, where I believe IIRC that there was an optional coproccessor. But surely nowadays with exponentially more complex and powerful CPUs it makes no difference in speed if doing floating point or integer calculation Especially since the actual calculation time is tiny compared to something like causing a pipeline stall or fetching something from main memoryp  pI know the correct answer is to benchmark on the target hardware, what would be a good way to test this I wrote two tiny C programs and compared their run time with time on Linux, but the actual run time is too variable doesnt help I am running on a virtual server. Short of spending my entire day running hundreds of benchmarks, making graphs etc. is there something I can do to get a reasonable test of the relative speed Any ideas or thoughts Am I completely wrongp  pThe programs I used as follows, they are not identical by any meansp  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltcmathgt include ltcstdlibgt include lttime.hgt  int main int argc, char argv       int accum  0      srand time NULL        for unsigned int i  0 i lt 100000000 i               accum  rand   365          stdcout ltlt accum ltlt stdendl      return 0  codepre  pProgram 2p  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltcmathgt include ltcstdlibgt include lttime.hgt  int main int argc, char argv        float accum  0     srand time NULL        for unsigned int i  0 i lt 100000000 i               accum  float rand   365           stdcout ltlt accum ltlt stdendl      return 0  codepre  pThanks in advancep  pEdit The platform I care about is regular x86 or x8664 running on desktop Linux and Windows machines.p  pEdit 2pasted from a comment below We have an extensive code base currently.

Negative 80 pSay you have a huge automation project and are using a certain testing framework, say JUnit for most of the automation. However you typically get stuck with automating the flash part of the the application . Now you can usually select several tools for that issue only. on the one hand tehre are tools that are standalone and include all framework elements such as If, database queries, multiple test runs etc and others that are plugins that solve the specific flash problem  but require to use the framework e.g.JUnit for creating s full blown test mainly data queries and loops.

Negative 80 pIm developing a lightweight WPF MVVM framework, and would like to be able to catch unhandled exceptions, and ideally recover from them.p  pIgnoring for the moment all the good arguments for not doing this, I encounter the following situationp  pIf I register a handler for AppDomain.CurrentDomain.UnhandledException within the OnStartup method of the App.xaml.cs, as follows...p  pApp.xaml.csp  precodeprotected override void OnStartupStartupEventArgs e    AppDomain.CurrentDomain.UnhandledException  new      UnhandledExceptionEventHandlerthis.AppDomainUnhandledExceptionHandler     base.OnStartupe     void AppDomainUnhandledExceptionHandlerobject sender, UnhandledExceptionEventArgs ea    Exception e  Exceptionea.ExceptionObject    log exception  codepre  pand then raise an exception within one of my VMs, the handler is called as expected.p  pSo far so good, except for the fact that there is no way that I can recover using this approach, all that I can do is log the exception and then let the CLR terminate the app.p  pWhat I actually wanted to do is to recover, and return control to the main framwork VM.  Again putting aside the motivations against doing this.p  pSo, doing some reading, I decide to register an event handler for AppDomain.CurrentDomain.UnhandledException in the same place, so that the code now looks something like this...p  precodeprotected override void OnStartupStartupEventArgs e    AppDomain.CurrentDomain.UnhandledException       new UnhandledExceptionEventHandlerthis.AppDomainUnhandledExceptionHandler     this.DispatcherUnhandledException       new DispatcherUnhandledExceptionEventHandlerDispatcherUnhandledExceptionHandler    base.OnStartupe   void AppDomainUnhandledExceptionHandlerobject sender, UnhandledExceptionEventArgs ea    Exception e  Exceptionea.ExceptionObject    log exception   void DispatcherUnhandledExceptionHandlerobject sender, DispatcherUnhandledExceptionEventArgs args    args.Handled  true    implement recovery  codepre  pThe issue is that once I register the handler for this.DispatcherUnhandledException, NEITHER EVENT HANDLER IS CALLED.  So registering the DispatcherUnhandledExceptionHandler somehow deactivates the handler for AppDomain.CurrentDomain.UnhandledException.p  pDoes anyone have an approach for catching and recovering from unhandled VM exceptions p  pIt might be important to mention that there is no explicit use of threading in the framework.p

Typically this program can handles at least 10 message per second. Unfortunately after a recent upgrade, this program for some reasons no longer able to process the messages fast enough usually around 7 AM. A message come in and it could sit in the program internal queue for more than 10 min before it can be processed. We also notice the program is using higher than normal CPU. Typically it should be 5 on the eight core machine, now it is 2025.p  pThe program does a more than handling incoming messages, it also maintains the database and serve data to clients. It has five threads handles the incoming messages and any maintenance job runs on its on thread.p  pThe current workaround is to restart the service when the slow down happens. After a restart, the program would run normal again CPU under 5. Until the next morning around 7 AM, it would happen agins. All the messages in the queue were discarded after each restart.  Usually 7 AM and 5 PM is the time when we receive a lot of messages, but the issue seems only happen during 7 AM.p  pOur team has tried to reproduce the program in house using simulated messages, and did code comparison to see if there any critical bottleneck.p

Negative 80 pSo, here is the scenario. I am developing a logon system in windows 7. I have created a Credential Provider, containing one Credential. The Credential has three input fields, username, password, and PIN.p  pFrom what I have learned the documentation CMIIW is that when we fill in the fields and click logon, WINLOGON will retrieve the username and password, and send it to LSA by calling LSALogonUser to authenticate. LSA then will try negotiate with Authentication Package KERBEROS for remote logon or MSV10 for local logon.p  pAssume only the local scenario for now, the username and password will be passed to MSV10, and be checked with those in SAM database. Now the thing is, I dont want it to be checked with SAM database. Lets say I have a file Cusers.txt which contains entries as triplets username  password  PIN. All the username here is an existing user in windows. How do I make it so that the authentication is following my way checking the file Cusers.txt.p  pIf Im not mistaken, we can create our own Authentication Package that wraps the MSV10.

Negative 80 pI try to build a list of mutable and immutable Sets. The compiler gets into trouble as it cannot figure out the type of that list. I always thought that I can connect Lists of any types and that the type of the new List is a kind of supertype of the connected Lists. In the following example, I define some lists. You can see the types of those lists, given by the compilerp  precodeval intList  List1 List[Int] val stringList  Listab List[java.lang.String] val mSetList  Listmutable.Set1, 2, 3 List[scala.collection.mutable.Set[Int]] val iSetList  Listimmutable.Set1, 2, 3 List[scala.collection.immutable.Set[Int]] codepre  pNow I use the codecode operator to connect these lists p  precodeval intStringList  intListstringList List[Any] val intMSetList  intListmSetList List[Any] val intISetList  intListiSetList List[Any] codepre  pAs expected, the compiler computes a common supertype codeList[Any]code of both lists. But the following does not compilep  precodeval iSetmSetList  iSetListmSetList type error codepre  pBut if I explicitly cast the two lists, it worksp  precodeval setList1  List[scala.collection.Set[Int]]  mSetList List[scala.collection.Set[Int]] val setList2  List[scala.collection.Set[Int]]  iSetList  List[scala.collection.Set[Int]] val setList  setList1setList2 List[scala.collection.Set[Int]] codepre  pWhy do I have to help the compiler to get the correct type of that list And why does it produce an error rather than simply type it with codeList[Any]code Is it theoretically impossible to compute the type codeList[scala.collection.Set[Int]]code or is it a kind of bug in the compilerp  pThanks a lot for your answers p
Negative 80 pI am attempting to manipulate a DOM tree using codelxmlcodes codeetreecode module.  One task I havent figured out yet is how to test whether a particular node is still part of a parsed tree.  Since the behavior of codeetreecode is mostly undefined if you remove nodes during codeElementTree.itercode, I do the manipulation in two phases.p  pFirst, I iterate through the parsed tree and mark some nodes for removal and certain other nodes for further processing by placing them in respective lists.  The second phase consists of iterating through the list of nodes to remove and removing them from the tree.  At this point, I have a list of nodes to process further and a tree that has been pruned substantially since it was first parsed.p  pWhat I lack is a way to test if a particular node in my nodestoprocess list still lives in the parse tree.  If it isnt part of the tree, that means its a descendant of one of the nodes I removed earlier and I want to discard it.  The problem is that there isnt an obvious way to do this test cheaply.  Even after a node has been removed from the codeElementTreecode calling codegetroottreecode on that node returns the original tree.p  pI could call codeiterancestorscode on each nodetoprocess and check for the root element I would expect for an intree node, but this is On and wont scale well for deep DOM trees.p  pDoes anyone know of a constant time operation, given an codeElementcode and an codeElementTreecode, to test whether the former is part of the latterp  pI realize that traversing a nodes parent chain upward might be the only way to do this test, and any faster way would require some bookkeeping to be implemented by the library.p

Negative 80 pI was just experimenting with the use of pointers when dealing with arrays and Ive become a bit confused with how C is handling the arrays. Here are the relevant bits of code I wrotep  precodedeclare a string as a pointer char szString  Randy                 cout ltlt Display string using a pointer  char pszString  szString while pszString cout ltlt pszString codepre  pFirst off, when I tried using cout to write what was in pszString without dereferencingI was a bit surprised to see it gave me the string. I just assumed it was because I gave the pointer a string and not a variable. p  pWhat really caught my attention though is that when I removed the asterisk from the line codecout ltlt pszStringcode it printed Randyandyndydyy. Im not sure why its writes the array AND then writes it again with 1 letter less. My reasoning is that after writing the char string the increment operator immediately brings the index to the next letter before it can reach the null terminator. I dont see why the null terminator wouldnt cause the loop to return false after the string is output for the first time otherwise. Is this the right reasoning Could someone explain if Im getting this relationship between arrays and pointersp

Negative 80 pIm constructing a .Net 4.0 library that contains a collection of workflows to provide basic business logic e.g. Add Customer, Update Customer, etc etc....  Within each workflow I have at least one or more CodeActivities to implement the desired functionality.p  pIn the name of modularity the CodeActivity does not contain the actual business logic itself, but rather has an [Import] for a provider object defined in another assembly to carry out the task.p  pFor Examplep  precodepublic sealed class AddCustomer CodeActivity      [ImporttypeofICustomerProvider]     private ICustomerProvider mprovider      public InArgumentltstringgt Name get set      public OutArgumentltboolgt Result  get set       protected override void ExecuteCodeActivityContext context              string name  context.GetValueName         context.SetValueResult, mprovider.AddCustomername       codepre  pMy original idea was to create a catalog in the constructor and call ComposeParts but this poses two issuesbr 1, It hardly seems efficient to create a new container every time an activity is created.p  p2, It breaks the design view of the workflow since the import cannot be satisfied at design time.p  pIdeally I would like to somehow mark the workflow itself as exportable, or at the very least only perform composition by the consumer of the library, however I cannot get this to work.p  pIf I try something likep  precodevar customerWorkflow  new AddCustomerWorkflow  NameFoobar  container.ComposePartscustomerWorkflow WorkflowInvoker.InvokecustomerWorkflow codepre  pI will get a null reference exception, which is suggesting to me that composition never touched the activities themselves.  To further complicate things, standard Activities have no codebehind, theyre just straight XAML files so I dont know of any way to mark them as exportable.  Also, if I try to call container.GetExport I get an error saying that the it knows of no container likely because its not marked as exportable.p  pIs what Im trying to do here even possible  It seems like a pretty straightforward task, but Im completely stumped.p

Negative 80 pIm on board with the whole cookieless domains  CDN thing, and I understand how just sending cookies for requests to www.yourdomain.com, while setting up a separate domain like cdn.yourdomain.com to keep unnecessary cookies from being sent can help performance.p  pWhat Im curious about is if using PHPs native sessions have a negative effect on performance, and if so, how I know the session key is kept track of in a cookie, which is small, and so that seems fine.p  pIm prompted to ask this question because in the past Ive written my web apps and stored a lof of the users active data, preferences, and authentication information in the codeSESSIONcode variable. However, I notice that some popular web applications out there, like Wordpress, dont use codeSESSIONcode at all. But sessions are easy to use and seem fairly secure, especially if you combine it with tracking useragent  ip changes to prevent session hijacking. So why dont Wordpress and other web apps use phps sessions Should I also stop using sessionsp  pAlso, let me also clarify that I do realize the server must load the session data to process a page request, but thats not what Im asking about here. My question is about if  how it impacts the network performance, especially in regard to the headers being sent  received. For example does using sessions prevent pages or images on the site from being served from the browsers cache Is the PHPSESID cookie the only additional header that is being sent These sorts of things.p

Negative 80 pHello I have an android application. In my app I have a SQLite database stored on the device that should be synchronized with a MySQL database stored on the server.p  pNow I have to retrieve a list of IDs. I can do it querying the SQLite database or the MySQL database. I chose to use the SQLite database because itd be much faster and easier considering what I have to do. But now I was thinking about it and I have a question emAre the android SQLite database files safeem I mean is there a possibility that someone access these files and modify information inside them or are they hidden to usersp  pBecause if I ask information from the server Im sure that it is safe, instead I dont know the security level of android databases.p  pLets suppose that each ID corresponds to an application ID I paid for for example application 3 and 5. When I find a way to modify the android database and so adding also application 7 and 8 it would seem to the device that Ive paid also for these applications instead I didnt and I cant use them. Thats why I was thinking to query the MySQL database, because the user cant modify it, but this way its gonna be slower. What do you thinkp

Negative 80 pIn an ASP.NET website we are storing sessions in SQL Server. All is working fine except that sessions frequently recycle. Ive a timeout period set to 30 minutes but some times it recycles within a few minutes. Weve a dedicated server, and website running under a classic application pool. Ive searched a lot on this problem, but didnt find a satisfactory answer. Any help will be greatly appreciated.p  pNote mostly it happens on a page where there is lots of use of viewstate, Im curious that is there a link of viewstate with session recycling p

Negative 80 pI want to write a cocoa application that checks if my ftp server is still up and running. So far I learned that CFFTP could be used but this is not object oriented code so a no go for me. Also some people recommend ConnectionKit but that wont build on 10.7. So my idea was to use terminal commands in my application with the help of NSTask. The problem is there are multiple commands that need to be executed, the first being emftp ftp.foobar.comem.

Negative 80 pWith some frequency I find myself writing APIs that offer an codeIteratorltFoogtcode which is backed by a network connection.  The implementation opens a network connection, reads information off the stream, and deserializes that information into codeFoocodes to pass on to the caller.  Unfortunately there is always the possibility of an codeIOExceptioncode and also the need to close the network connection gracefully that can be made automatic when the caller reads the last codeFoocode, but what if that doesnt happen.p  pThere are already a couple of questions a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2346978howshoulditeratorimplementationdealwithcheckedexceptionsherea and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4450138howtoaddthrowsexceptionclausewhenimplementingamethoddefinedinainterherea about how to deal with checked exceptions that would be thrown in an implementation of codeIteratorcode, and the accepted advice is wrap them in unchecked codeRuntimeExceptioncodes.  Meanwhile to allow closing the network connection we can implement codeCloseablecode.  So we end up with something like this for a wellbehaved exceptionchecking callerp  precodeIteratorltFoogt iter  null try      iter  getFooIterator     whileiter.hasNext          Foo foo  iter.next          do something with foo       catchRuntimeException e      ife.getCause instanceof IOException          do something with the IOException          else throw e  finally      ifiter instanceof Closeable try  Closeableiter.close  catchIOException e   codepre  pAnd it seemed like such a nice idea to implement codeIteratorcode.

Negative 80 pHello stackoverflow crew. Im in a programming class where we have just switched from python to C. Im having a bit of trouble with it, as C doesnt seem to perform mathematical operations with the ease that python does, or Im missing something when it comes to math in C.p  pFor my homework, Im writing a program that collects how many miles to a gallon users car gets, how much their gas costs per gallon, and how many miles they drive each month. The program then tells them how much they can expect to pay for gas for the current month. My current code is as followsp  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt  int main    int mpg, miles double gasprice  printfHow many miles per gallon does your car getn scanfd, ampmpg  printfWhat is the price of gasoline per gallonn scanflf, ampgasprice  printfHow many miles do you drive in a monthn scanfd, ampmiles  printfThe cost of gas this month is .2lfn, miles  mpg  gasprice  printfd d d, mpg, gasprice, miles  return 0  codepre  pWhen I run the program with the values 24 for mpg, 3.00 for gasprice, and 1000 for miles, the total comes to 123.00. This isnt correct, and is about two dollars less than the actual price. When you take 1000  24  3.00, you should get 125 even. I added a string to print out all the values to see what C was using for the formula in line 23, and while mpg and gasprice are correct, miles shows up as having a value of 1,074,266,112. I know there must be some error here, as this would throw the result off way more than 2 dollars, but I cant help but think its related.p  pI apologize for the length of the question, but I wanted to be as specific as possible, and Im completely stumped as to why C is reading this in so strangely. Thanks in advance for all of your help.p

Negative 80 pIs there a good way to invalidate a Forms Authentication session from the serverp  pI understand that the cookie has an embedded expiration, but I want to do an additional check on the server to verify that the user has not manually signed out.  When a user manually signs out, I call a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.web.security.formsauthentication.signout.aspx relnofollowcodeFormsAuthentication.SignOutcodea which expires the cookie.  However, if I use a developer tool to set the cookie back to its original value, I am still logged in.p  pOne option I can think of would be to embed the login id into the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.web.security.formsauthenticationticket.userdata.aspx relnofollowcodeUserDatacodea portion of the ticket.  By this, I mean that each login is recorded in a database and there is an id associated with it.  When a user manually logs out, I could update the database record to show they have done so.  This however, would require me querying the database each time a user was authenticated not ideal.  I could maintain a cache, but it seems like that would be a lot of work and I was hoping there was an easier way p  pThanksp

Negative 80 pJust to give you some context, heres what Im trying to achieve I am embedding a const char in a shared object file in order to have a version string in the .so file itself.

At this address its there, zero terminated and as expected. I am using this method for now.p  pI am not a computer scientist.

Negative 80 pI have a problem with server interpreting domain.comindex as domain.comindex.php. This screws with my URL structure. p  pI have created a .htaccess file with the followingp  precodeltIfModule modrewrite.cgt RewriteEngine On  RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME f RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME d  RewriteRule . index.phpurl1 [PT,L]  ltIfModulegt codepre  pSo if I type in the URL domain.comindexabout I want to get indexabout from codeGET[url]code. But instead it is blank. If I type any other URL not starting with index, like domain.comfoobar I get the expected results.p  pI understand that this is due to codeRewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME fcode which ignores any Rewrite if a file with same filename exist.p  pSo my RewriteRules gives me the results I want as long as URL doesnt involve the word index or other dir or filename. And that is all fine, since I have no other dirs or files in the current dir.p  pstrongSo question isstrong Can I make it more specific, as to say ignore filename.php instead of just filename Meaning that emdomain.comindexaboutem should work but not emdomain.comindex.phpaboutem. p  pstrongSide questionstrong And why does emdomain.comindexaboutem not work anyways I have no dir called indexabout and no file called indexabout. Why does it interpret indexsomething as index.phpsomething which makes no sense, as I cannot have a dir inside a file.p

Negative 80 pi have been doing the KVM stuff and have a couple of questions that can not figure out.p  p1 as we know, normally the external interrupt will cause VMexit and the hypervisor will inject a virtual interrupt if it is for guest. Then which irq will be injected i mean the interrupt vector for indexing the guest IDT How does the KVM get to know about this associate a host IRQ with a guest virtual IRQ  p  p2 if for assigned device to the guest, the hypervisor will deliver that IRQ to the guest. by tracing the code, i found the host IRQ is different with the guests i mean the interrupt vector. how the KVM configure which interrupt vector the guest should usep  p3 if we configure not exit on external interrupt by setting some field in VMCS, what will happen during the physical interrupts will the CPU use the guest IDT for response interrupt If so, can KVM redirect the CPU to use another IDT for guest assuming modifying the IDTRp  p4 where is the guest IDT located it this configured by the qemu while initializing the vcpu and registers include the IDTRp  pI really hope someone can reply to my questions. I will be very appreciated.p  pThanksp
Negative 80 h2Summaryh2  pIn our web application when the user clicks faster than the page loads, apparently the browser shows the first request to the user according to some error messages we get. I would have expected that to be the second request.p  h2More background informationh2  pWe have a Struts1 web application. In the user session we put the current context of the user interaction. p  precoderequest.getSession.setAttributecontext, ltsomethinggt codepre  pFor instance, the app shows a list of master records, and the context holds information about the user. When the user clicks on a master record, we save the the information  about that record in the user session object. In the JSPs we often would assign the context object to a local variable. This needs casting to the specific type e.g. codeMasterRecordDTOcode or codeUserDTOcodep  precodelt MasterRecordDTO dto  MasterRecordDTO request.getSession.getAttributecontext gt codepre  pThe user can then drill down into details views of that master record. We have a breadcrumbs showing sth like codelist gt master gt detailcode. These are links so the user can navigate using breadcrumbs.p  pNow when in that situation the user clicks first on master and quickly enough on list he gets an ClassCastException saying p  precodeUserDTO cannot be cast to MasterRecordDTO  codepre  pin the MasterRecordJSP, which means that when the MasterRecordJSP assigns the codedtocode variable in the first request, the second request has already set the codecontextcode session attribute to a codeUserDTOcode object. p  h2Questionh2  pI would have expected that the browser would abandon the first request and shows the result of the second request to the user the list of master records in this example.

Negative 80 pI have an app that create routes for sportworkout purpose by tapping on locations on a Google MapView. The longitude and latitude value are extracted from a GeoPoint object after each tap, in the overridable onTap method. I use proximity alerts on check points throughout routes.p  pThe problem is that these longitudelatitude values are too imprecise with only six decimal points, eg. code55.907648code lati code3.320976code longi. This causes proximity alert to fire much too early, a good distance from the location that is displayed by a marker on the map from where users actually did tap in creating the route.p  pBut when using LocationManager and registering for location updates on the position of the Android device, I get strongmuchstrong more precise location updates from Location objects than GeoPoint, with 15 decimal points, which is desirable. Example of latitude from a Location object code55.91135487283476code.p  pThe question is is there any way to get more precise longitude and latitude values from interacting with a Google MapView Using some web service perhaps..p  pThanks alot in advance for any help on this accuracy issuep

Negative 80 pI am working on a web application page which consists of a form that is three pages long Im constrained to keep it that way for the users, even though it is not the most efficient way of doing it. p  pMy question is What is the best practice for keeping track of the information from one page of the form to the next Generally, we store everything in session variables until the last form where we make a stored procedure call or inline SQL to update the database with the results of the form. The other option would be to use inline SQL pagebypage to store the data before going from one page to the next. p  pTLDR  session variable storage of data and SQL after 3 pages, or inline SQL at each pagep  pThanksp

Negative 80 pI am creating an app where I am using MvvmCross on WP7 along with a Bing Maps control. I am trying to bind the codeMapItemsControlcode codeItemSourcecode to an codeObservableCollectioncode of codeLocationDataSourcecode, which contain a property codeMapPositioncode of the type codeGeoPointcode. codeGeoPointcode is a simple class which contain information about the Latitude and Longitude of the location. The locations which I populate into the codeObservableCollectioncode are fetched by a service which my codeViewModelcode listens to and updates the collection when it has fetched the locations. Though it does not seem to work as no locations are shown on the map. To bind the codeGeoPointcodes I have made a converter which simply converts to codeGeoCoordinatecode which the codeMapItemsControlcode understands.

Negative 80 pI use a nexus s with bcm4329 to communicate with a pc in ad hoc mode. bcm4329 sends a arp request to the pc the pc sends a arp reply back to bcm4329. However, bcm4329 does not deliver the arp reply to upper layer but drops it. Furthermore, bcm4329 also drops unicast udp packets.p  pActually, I removed PKTFILTERSUPPORT and ARPOFFLOADSUPPORT in bcm4329s makefile and even turned off power management in bcm4329.p  pAny idea about it Appreciate itp
Negative 80 pI know that Camels JMS component, for receiving messages, uses Springs DefaultMessageListenerContainer. It can be configured to use CLIENTACKNOWLEDGE mode for acknowledging messages.

Negative 80 blockquote   pstrongPossible Duplicatestrongbr   a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5345152whywouldipreferusingvectortodequeWhy would I prefer using vector to dequea  p blockquote    pI am curious why is it that a hrefhttpen.cppreference.comwcppcontainervectorcodestdvectorcodea is so much more popular than a hrefhttpen.cppreference.comwcppcontainerdequecodestddequecodea. Deque is almost as efficient in lookup, more efficient in insert without vectorreserveand allows for insertingdeleting in the front. p  pHerb Sutter once recommended that a hrefhttpwww.gotw.cagotw054.htmif you want to use vector, just prefer dequea I am paraphrasing. However in a recent talk on a hrefhttpchannel9.msdn.comEventsBuildBUILD2011TOOL835TWriting Modern Ca he again strongly recommends thinking of codestdvectorcode as a default container. According to the a hrefhttpwww.gotw.cagotw054.htmGOTWa I linked earlier, even the standard has similar wording. p  pIs there a reason for this disparity Is it just that codevectorcode is simpler and more well known, or is there a technical reason Or is it that codevectorcode is just a cooler name .. p

Negative 80 pIm running a bunch of AIX systems and I would like to change the way in which users are created. p  pBy default users are made with the group assignment both primary and only group membership as staff.

Negative 80 pI need to sort a NSMutableArray containing NSURLs with localizedStandardComparep  precode[array sortUsingComparatorNSComparisonResultid obj1, id obj2      NSString f1  [NSURL obj1 absoluteString]     NSString f2  [NSURL obj2 absoluteString]     return [f1 localizedStandardComparef2] ] codepre  pThis works fine, but I worry a bit about the performance the block will be evaluated n log n times during the sort, so Id like it to be fast the array might have up to 100,000 elements. Since localizedStandardCompare is only available on NSString, I need to convert the URLs to strings. Above, I use codeabsoluteStringcode, but there are other methods that return a NSString, for example relativeString. Reading the NSURL class reference, I get the impression that relativeString might be faster, since the URL does not need to be resolved, but this is my first time with Cocoa and OSX, and thus just a wild guess.p  pAdditional constraint in this case, all URLs come from a NSDirectoryEnumerator on local storage, so all are file URLs. It would be a bonus if the method would work for all kinds of URL, though.p  pMy question which method should I use to convert NSURL to NSString for best performancep  pProfiling all possible methods might be possible, but I have only one rather fast OSX machine, and who knows  one day the code might end up on iOS.p  pIm using Xcode 4.5.2 on OSX 10.8.2, but the program should work on older version, too within reasonable bounds.p

Negative 80 pTwo things to keep in mind before I expose my problem 1. Im not a programmer, therefore I have NO IDEA of what Im doing 2. Talk to me like Im stupid, and be very very patient see 1.p  pAlright, there are about a million things wrong in the way the site is set up, but right now Im just trying to make Isotope work with Lazyload. Ive probably read every single stackoverflow on the issue but so far I havent been able to solve my problem. Im using Stacey as CMS. Basically, what Im trying to achieve is similar to xxx.aestheticallyloyal.com or in fact, www.imageworkshop.comlazyloadportfolio, but with clickable thumbnails arranged IsotopeMasonry style that open in their respective project pages. I tried getting Infinitescroll to work but Im not entierely sure pagination is supported in Stacey, therefore I gave up on that. Enter Lazyload.p  pI got Isotope to work fine. I can get Lazyload to work fine, separatedly. But whenever I try to mix the two, I fail miserably. The problem is that the images are organized by Isotope before theyre fully loaded, therefore they dont get aligned according to their actual size which is variable but get a fixed width and height Im ok with fixed width, thats the point, but height should scale accordingly. If I resize the window after that, though, the grid is adjusted accordingly, as it should.p  pThis is the code Im working withp  precode    ltscriptgt function       var window  window     var container  container     var imgs  img.lazy      imgs.lazyload         event scroll,         effect fadeIn,         failurelimit Math.maximgs.length  1, 0,         appear function             function           container.imagesLoadedfunction               container.isotope                 onLayout function                       window.triggerscroll                 ,                 itemSelector .photo                                 window.loadfunction           container.isotopereLayout           ltscriptgt codepre  pIts probably wrong in so many ways... I dont know. Plus, as is, I think reLayout is doing absolutely nothing, and from there I really dont know where to go anyway. Can anybody have a look at my site flow.blukaet.com and let me know how to sort this mess Nevermind the menu on the left, I havent even begun looking at that. Thanks.p  pstrongUPDATE 1strongp  pIve been trying to use a different Lazyload script called Fasterize. Things seem to fare only marginally better, but Im still having problems displaying the images that appear below the fold in a correct manner. Basically anything that loads in the viewport gets sorted fine by Isotope, but the remaining images dont get added based on their actual, final, visible size. Id need to trigger something in Isotope to make it rearrange the new items after they are loaded. I dont know if its possible at all. Can anybody help Heres the site where you can see whats going on flow.blukaet.com The code above is no longer actual.p  pstrongUPDATE 2strongp  pSo this is the amended code thanks to the answer provided below also, this is using fasterizelazyload as opposed to appelsiinis lazyloadp  precodeltscriptgt window.loadfunction    var container  container var imgs  img  container.imagesLoadedfunction       container.isotope         itemSelector .photo        window.scrollfunction       container.isotopereLayout   ltscriptgt codepre  pIts not super smooth, but it gets the job done.p  pPreviously I tried something along the lines ofp  precodeltscriptgt function    var container  container var imgs  img  container.imagesLoadedfunction       container.isotope         itemSelector .photo        imgs.loadfunction       container.isotopereLayout   ltscriptgt codepre  pWhich actually ran much smoother, but somehow was giving the following console error p  blockquote   pcannot call methods on isotope prior to initialization attempted to call method reLayoutp blockquote  pSo I dont know.p  pAnother thing to note is that the code works in FF and Opera. Apparently Safari ignores lazyloading altogether. I havent tested in Chrome and IE. If anybody wants to check out flow.blukaet.comp

Negative 80 pAs an excercise I want to implement a solution to the producerconsumer problem. Lets say Ill have an array int[] buffer and two methods Produce and Consume that will simulate the producer and customer, respectively, and one Execute method to call both method asynchronously. p  pIts probably to test whether the implementation will not result in a deadlock, just make Produce and Consume repeat for a large number of time like 1 million, make Execute wait for these two methods to finish, and then in my unit test just make sure the call returns after certain time maybe 1 minute.

Negative 80 pIm calling a .net webservice from my .net winforms app, both in framework 4.0.  During the execution of the program, the first time the webservice has a method called, the call takes 1012 seconds.  Subsequent calls take 12 seconds.  Subsequent calls, even when the web reference instance is recreated, are still 12 seconds.  When the winforms app is restarted, the first call delay occurs again, but subsequent calls are responsive.p  pThe instance of the web reference is being created prior to the call occuring, and is not part of the delay.p  pXmlSerializers for the winforms app are being generated and used, as far as I know, but Im not sure how to verify this.p  pThe delay is not occuring because of a firstrun compilation on the webservice side.  This is a production webservice that is being used throughout the day, and its apppool is remaining in memory.  As far as I can see, the delay is occurring either on the client side, or between the client and the server for that first call, but not subsequent calls.p  pNot sure what to check next.  Any ideasp
Negative 80 pIm working in a Com Server DLL where I use requests to make POST a multipart form along with some XML file. Localy, it works great and with no error. I can call the COM object methods and it returns me what Im expeting to.p  pNow, when I use py2exe to build a dist version of the app, and try to register the DLL Com Server with regsvr32, I get the following error Runtime Error ... R6034 An application has made an attempt to load the C runtime library incorrecly. ... Also, Ive noticed that if I remove any reference to the requests library in my python code, I dont get this issue obviously, Ive lost the main functionality of the module.p  pI tried distributing the C runtime DLLs with the manifest solution in every possible flavor. Also installed the runtime from the microsoft redistributable installer. No effects whatsoever. Im possitively sure that its got nothing to do with the runtime itself.p  pMade virtual machines with W7 and XP, for testing purposes. I can register the Com server with regsvr32, but the error occurs when calling the method. However, if I comment the line where I make the POST with the request lib, or if I call another method where request is not involved, no errors occurs and everything seems to be working fine. Of course, the key functionality of the COM is lost, since everything revolves around the request lib. And I sincerely dont want to use the primitive urllib lib...p  pMy conclusion seems to be something with py2exe and the request lib. Some dependency has to be missing. Although I cant figure what or why, since py2exe seems to be packing everything... Never before has any problem distributing COM servers with py2exe. Has anyone had any similar problem with py2exe and requestsp

Negative 80 pIve been having a bit of difficulty understanding the whole has many through concept and how it works in Rails, I presume it does the leg work for you, as Im used to building the associations manually. I currently have a Billing System, and Im trying to create an orders section, and obviously my order must have many products, so Ive normalised the database to 3rd normal form, so that the Orders and the Products are linked via another table named ordered products, this table contains the ID of the order and the ID of the Product, along with the Quantity of product ordered.

Negative 80 pThis may seem on the surface to be a very basic question but its something Ive never been able to do. And Im wondering if someone can help as its really impacting my scriptingp  pIm a Brit living in Japan, my computer keyboard is a Japanese model with all the icons in the Japanese place but my setup on windows is to think the keyboard is British Im just so used to everything been in its proper place and dont have to look at the keyboard to type. For most purposes this is great. p  pHowever, I cant seem to be able to do a back slash. Where it should be in the bottom left is on a Japanese keyboard an extra big tab, back slash is instead over on the bottom right, near forward slash, a key which does nothing on my setup.p  pDoes anyone know a way to configure windows 7 so that when I alt and shift to switch my typing language something easy to do. Dont need help there it also switches the type of keyboard it thinks I have. Or, even better, customise the layout of my keyboard. Hope this doesnt get closed as many other config questions seem to have been as my being able to script depends upon thisp
Negative 80 pIn VBA, the Long and Object data type are both 4bytes, which is the size of a memory address. Does this mean that, technically, the Object data type doesnt do anything that a Long couldnt do If yes, then is it safe to say that the Object data type exists simply to make it easier for the programmer to distinguish between the purpose of the variablep  pThis question came up as I was considering Win32 API function declarations. They are often times declared as Long, and, unless I am mistaken, their return value is simply a memory address. Seems like defining these functions as Object would have been more appropriate, then.p  pAm I totally off Thanks in advance.p

My question  of course  how do I break this script up into smaller chunksp  pstrongEditstrong I have a workaround.  I apologize it is out of the scope I defined in the original question.  I didnt mention that this is simply a table of potential part numbers.  Particularly, all the potential part numbers allowed by the logic of the part numbering system.  Rather than have a master list of part numbers at the ready just waiting to be used I figure I might be better off validating new part input against the part numbering logic, a function like codecouldthisbeapartnumberinputcode.  It could just test the inputted string against the part numbering logic as opposed to having some master table I would need to check against. p  pstrongEdit x2strong  Im sorry this is the worst.  I moved codeunsetbuildpartcode into the innermost for loop.  The problem was I was trying to a development function in Drupal to print out each buildpart before it was unset  codedpmbuildpartcode.  The script runs fine, its trying to build a webpage with that many part numbers printed to it is what breaks the script.p

Negative 80 pIve got an issue with saving a BufferedImage using a simple paint program. When I save the image from the paint such as a picture of a snake that I drew earlier, it saves the image just fine, but it doesnt save it in the way you might think. Instead of saving the image to a C drive or whatever drive a user may be using it saves the image to the eclipse workspace. This of course is unacceptable, as this needs to be given directly to a users main place of access is. Here is the method that is used for saving the bufferedimage.p  precodestatic void saveImage          try              ImageIO.writebackground, png,                     new FilefileName  .png          catch IOException e              e.printStackTrace               codepre  pSo here, background is obviously the image being saved, png is the extension, and fileName is a string that is saved earlier using a prior method that isnt important here. This method saves the image to the strongeclipse workspace. This is bad.strong We need this to save to the default drive. How do I accomplish this Let me know if you need anything else to aid you with your answer. p  pEDIT So, as requested, here is the code that changes the fileName. It is in a different class with a differnt UI completely, and because Im not sure of how much to post, Ill post the actionListener and the codegetNamecode method. What happens here is that there is a codeJTextFieldcode that, once a codeJButtoncode is pressed, has the string extracted from it and uses it as the codefileNamecode. Heres the code p  precodefinishButton.addActionListenernew ActionListener                 public void actionPerformedActionEvent e                     ProgramUI.fileName  getName                    ProgramUI.fileHasName  true                    ProgramUI.saveImage                    frame.dispose                                    public String getName          return nameField.getText       codepre

Than I can display it in codeUIWebViewcode.p  pI tried with same approach to parse the epub 3 file. I got the code.opfcode file and parse it but the problem is there is no code.ncxcode file. It has codetoc.xhtmlcode file. It is the index file what I needed but in codexhtmlcode format. I am not sure if all files have same format or not. If all epub3 has same format than I can created a custom HTML parser according to my requirement.p  pIs there any efficient epub3 reader sample available for ios I found one a hrefhttpsgithub.comreadiumreadiumsdk relnofollowherea but it contains errors and there is nothing mentioned for configuring it.p  pAny help please.p

Negative 80 pIn my project, I have 5 tables Category, CategoryHasProduct, Product, StoreHasProduct and Store. There I store all my products, in which categories they are and in which store which product is available.p  pNow, I want to know how many products in all the categories are available, depending on which store is selected. For performance reasons, I want to use a SQL query for this. The query isp  precodeSELECT      count,      cp.categoryid  FROM      categoryhasproduct cp,      product p,      storehasproduct sp  WHERE      p.sku  cp.productid AND      sp.productid  p.sku AND      sp.storeid  2 AND      sp.isActive  1   GROUP BY cp.categoryid codepre  pIn the Project I use ORMLite. But to query this, I do a basic dbqueryp  precodeString query  ... SQLiteDatabase db  DBConnector.getConnectorcontext.getWritableDatabase Cursor cursor  db.rawQueryquery, null codepre  pNow I have a problem, which makes no sense to me. On Android 4.0.3, everything works fine. The query takes something like 0.5 seconds to run and I can proceed. But when I try to execute the query on Android 2.3.3, the query itself seems to run into an infinite loop. Even after 20 minutes, the query is not finished. On a real device, the processor of the device is getting very hot, so it shuts himself down.p  pAs I tried a little bit with the query, it seems that it is to large for sqlite on 2.3.3devices. the concatenation with the last storehaseproducttable seems to enlarge the query to much. I also tried other statements like nested queries or joins, but it seems that they have the same problem.p  pDoes anybody else has observed such a strange behavior of sqlite And the much more important question what can I do to make this query work on Android 2.3.3 with a near equal runtimep

Negative 80 pIm making a small game. Its not an action one, but a puzzle one, so performance is not quite as important. Now, I have the main game area, a background image. In certain occasions, I want to draw other images over parts of the background image. My problem is that both the background image as well as the superimposed ones can be animated gifs, with an unknown number of frames basically, user selected.p  pNow, what I want to do is basically Draw the background image and have it animated if its a gif, then draw 0n smaller animated gifs on top of it, position relative to background image, given in pixel coordinates. Additionally, it should be resizeable so that the images zoommove accordingly.p  pHow end result could look like  a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comPxdDt.png relnofollowhttpi.stack.imgur.comPxdDt.pnga just imagine it animatedp  pI have found a solution to it which works by setting the layout manager to null and using absolutely positioned JLabels with Icons to have them animated, using one as background and the other one added to it as foregroundp  precodebackground.setSizebackgroundIcon.getIconWidth, backgroundIcon.getIconHeight foreground.setSizeforegroundIcon.getIconWidth, foregroundIcon.getIconHeight background.setLocation0, 0 foreground.setLocation30, 30 background.setLayoutnull background.addforeground frame.setLayoutnull frame.addbackground codepre  pfull code belowp  pSetting the layout manager to null is, as I heard, problematic esp. since Id want to add some text to the image later on, though Id use another Label inside the background one, not the background label itself or something, and resizing seems not to be possible this way as I cant resize the JLabels image icon found some solutions which splitted the gif into one bufferedImage per layer and resized them all before putting them back together again, through which it loses specific delays between frames and so on. Also, since the position should be pixel perfect, resizing even if possible could be problematic due to rounding errors.p  pNow, is there a better way to do this Can I somehow load animated gifs and merge them manually even tough they may have a different number of layers so I had to paint only one image Is there a layout manager where I can set the components positions manually but which automatically scales it if you resize the windowpanel Is there maybe a thirdparty graphics project that could do what I want off the batp  pIdeally would be something like what I would do if they werent animations, like building a merged Image and then resizing and displaying that one.p  pFull codep  precodeimport java.awt.Dimension import java.net.MalformedURLException import java.net.URL  import javax.swing.Icon import javax.swing.ImageIcon import javax.swing.JFrame import javax.swing.JLabel  public final class Tester  extends JFrame      public static void mainString[] args throws MalformedURLException          new Tester           private Tester throws MalformedURLException          setTitleTester         setDefaultCloseOperationJFrame.EXITONCLOSE          Icon backgroundIcon  new ImageIconnew URLhttps5.favim.comorig51animatedgifgifhandssignlanguageFavim.com542945.gif         Icon foregroundIcon  new ImageIconnew URLhttpi.imgur.com89HANHg.gif          JLabel background  new JLabelbackgroundIcon         JLabel foreground  new JLabelforegroundIcon           ugly         background.setSizebackgroundIcon.getIconWidth, backgroundIcon.getIconHeight         foreground.setSizeforegroundIcon.getIconWidth, foregroundIcon.getIconHeight         background.setLocation0, 0         foreground.setLocation30, 30         background.setLayoutnull         background.addforeground         setLayoutnull         addbackground           set size of frame to size of content         setResizablefalse         getContentPane.setPreferredSizenew DimensionbackgroundIcon.getIconWidth, backgroundIcon.getIconHeight         pack          setLocationRelativeTonull         setVisibletrue       codepre

It didnt even work for me  the image from my webcamera was inverted, frames were changing every few seconds and nothing was being displayed.p  pSo what I ask for is not a whole solution. If someone explained me the way how to do it, Id be glad. I want to understand it from basics and I just dont know where to go now. I spent much time on trying to solve it, if I didnt, I would not bother you with my problem.p  pIm lookin forward for you answers p  pGreetings, Danielp  pEDIT I changed the code. Now you can see how I try to warp the perspective on my image. Firstly I thought that the reason why after calling warpPerspective function my image Mat changed its Mat krzywe, I changed its name so it wont be confusing is black, is the fact I dont start warping perspective everytime from the basic photo. So I added the line     changedMatzdjeciep  pI guess my problem is pretty simply to solve but I really have no idea now.p

Negative 80 pOk so Im very very confused how a piece of hardware can understand code. I read somewhere it has to do with voltages but how exactly does the piece of hardware know what an instruction in software means I know drivers is the bridge between software and hardware but a driver is still software S.p  pFor example, in C we have pointers and they can point to some address in memory.. Can we have a pointer that points to some hardware address and then write to that address and it would affect the hardware Or does hardware not have addressesp  pI guess what Im really asking is how does the OS or BIOS know where a piece of hardware is and how to talk to itp

Im teaching myself Matplotlib right now, so Im sure a junior programmer can see my obvious error in a very short time, but Ive been at it for some time and getting nowhere fast. The main thing I want to do here is just get the lines and points to be redrawn after every click without any of the previously set points to remain on the graph.  Similarly with the textbox on the upper left of the graph, the values should be reset there after every click and not rewrite themselves over each previous string of text.p  pEDITp  pI have tried codeclacode and codeclfcode and they dont appear to work in this case. In fact, they may not even be necessary at any point in this program as codesetdatacode methods I used should be enough to redraw based on the new data from every click.  To prove that, just uncomment the entire codeplotGraphcode method in my class and comment out the same code in codeupdatecode and youll see that the points codePcode and codeQcode will be set new after ever click.  The real problem is the codeRcode point, the lines, and the text box on the upper left.p

Negative 80 pRight now I have a main game loop that constantly redraws the screen. Since I need to slow this thread down but continue to draw other items at a faster rate I need to make a new thread. The problem is I am not sure how to go about making a new thread that also draws to the screen  I know how to make a new thread, I am just stuck on how to implement the Graphics2D drawing in the new thread. For example I have the code below which is the typical starting point and then there is the draw method defined in the other class that directs what and when to draw. If I wanted to branch off and have another thread drawing and doing its own thing how do I do that p  pDo I have to make a new class that creates an entirely new PaintComponent  Or would I simply create a new Graphics2D object so I can use different font colors and such I guess what confuses me most is that I cant just call a different draw method because I still need to pass g2d as the argument. So it appears to me that I need to make the thread from within another method that already has the g2d object. p  pIf this is confusing I do apologize as I am still a beginner to JAVA. If you need more information just let me know. Thank you in advance. p  precode public abstract void drawGraphics2D g2d    Override  public void paintComponentGraphics g  Graphics2D g2d  Graphics2Dg  super.paintComponentg2d  drawg2d   codepre

Negative 80 pIve got a 3 column JTable.  Column 2 is a checkbox which I want to enabledisable the JSpinner for that row.  p  pIve got working how I want except for one thing  The JSpinner doesnt actually look like its disabled text and spinner buttons greyed out.   Im not quite sure how to attain this.  Ive tried forcibly calling setEnabledfalse on the JSpinner, but the table doesnt seem to redraw correctly.p  pHere is some code Ive gotten working through other StackOverflow examplesp  precodeimport

Negative 80 pIn short, Im having issues specifically flattening stamp comments in PDFs while using Itextsharp.

Using some very simple Javascript code also seems to work just fine this.flattenPages. p  pThis problems seems to specifically pertain to stamps, which is the real trick of it. Ive successfully used the pdfstamper class to flatten some other kinds of page comments and annotations e.g. text boxes usingp  precode   stamper.FormFlattening  True     stamper.FreeTextFlattening  True codepre  pBut this does NOT work for the any stamps Ive tried the default included in Acrobat or user created. The document just comes out on the other end with the same editable stamp. So... any ideas And please let me know if theres any additional information I can provide. Thanks. p  pUpdate Obviously this is not the same as other annotations. For whatever its worth, the stamps specifically show up as overcontents. How one would go about changing a flag or otherwise mergingflattening it onto the page is something else I cant find documentation for. p

Negative 80 pIm using a Ryu open flow controller switch written in python to monitor packets in my virtual mininet.I have 3 hosts and Im blocking transportation from host2 to host3 and from host3 to host2. Other packets are added to the switch flow table. My problem is that after a flow is added, if their is a packet between 2 hosts that have a rule in the flow table of the switch, my event doesnt trigger.  For example, if the switch saw a packet from host1 to host2 it is legal so the flow is added to the table, but if another packet from host1 to host2 is sent it wont go through the method again. I looked in Ryu guides but didnt find anyhting regarding the case when a flow was already added to the switch flow table. How can I catch the packetsp  pThanks in advance.p  pHeres my codep  precodeimport logging import struct  from ryu.base import appmanager from ryu.controller import mactoport from ryu.controller import ofpevent from ryu.controller.handler import MAINDISPATCHER from ryu.controller.handler import setevcls from ryu.ofproto import ofprotov10 from ryu.lib.mac import haddrtostr     class SimpleSwitchappmanager.RyuApp OFPVERSIONS  [ofprotov10.OFPVERSION] counterTraffic0     def initself, args, kwargs     superSimpleSwitch, self.initargs, kwargs     self.mactoport    def addflowself, datapath, inport, dst, actions     ofproto  datapath.ofproto      wildcards  ofprotov10.OFPFWALL     wildcards amp ofprotov10.OFPFWINPORT     wildcards amp ofprotov10.OFPFWDLDST      match  datapath.ofprotoparser.OFPMatch         wildcards, inport, 0, dst,         0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0      mod  datapath.ofprotoparser.OFPFlowMod         datapathdatapath, matchmatch, cookie0,         commandofproto.OFPFCADD, idletimeout0, hardtimeout0,         priorityofproto.OFPDEFAULTPRIORITY,         flagsofproto.OFPFFSENDFLOWREM, actionsactions     datapath.sendmsgmod  setevclsofpevent.EventOFPPacketIn, MAINDISPATCHER         def packetinhandlerself, ev  printIm in main function     msg  ev.msg     datapath  msg.datapath     ofproto  datapath.ofproto      dst, src, ethtype  struct.unpackfrom6s6sH, buffermsg.data, 0      dpid  datapath.id     self.mactoport.setdefaultdpid,       self.logger.infopacket in s s s s,                      dpid, haddrtostrsrc, haddrtostrdst,                      msg.inport  if haddrtostrdst  000000000001     print dst     self.counterTraffic 1  if not haddrtostrsrc  000000000002 and  haddrtostrdst 000000000003or haddrtostrsrc  000000000003 and  haddrtostrdst 000000000002          learn a mac address to avoid FLOOD next time.     printafter condition         self.mactoport[dpid][src]  msg.inport          if dst in self.mactoport[dpid]             outport  self.mactoport[dpid][dst]         else                 outport  ofproto.OFPPFLOOD              actions  [datapath.ofprotoparser.OFPActionOutputoutport]            install a flow to avoid packetin next time         if outport  ofproto.OFPPFLOOD                 self.addflowdatapath, msg.inport, dst, actions          out  datapath.ofprotoparser.OFPPacketOut         datapathdatapath, bufferidmsg.bufferid, inportmsg.inport,                 actionsactions          datapath.sendmsgout     if haddrtostrsrc  000000000001         print src                 self.counterTraffic 1     printself.counterTraffic   setevclsofpevent.EventOFPPortStatus, MAINDISPATCHER def portstatushandlerself, ev     msg  ev.msg     reason  msg.reason     portno  msg.desc.portno      ofproto  msg.datapath.ofproto     if reason  ofproto.OFPPRADD         self.logger.infoport added s, portno     elif reason  ofproto.OFPPRDELETE         self.logger.infoport deleted s, portno     elif reason  ofproto.OFPPRMODIFY         self.logger.infoport modified s, portno     else         self.logger.infoIlleagal port state s s, portno, reason codepre

Negative 80 pImagine that you have interfaces which describe the data access layer of your application.

Negative 80 pI have a couple of gigantic XML files 10GB40GB that have a very simple structure just a single root node containing multiple row nodes. Im trying to parse them using SAX in Python, but the extra processing I have to do for each row means that the 40GB file takes an entire day to complete. To speed things up, Id like to use all my cores simultaneously. Unfortunately, it seems that the SAX parser cant deal with malformed chunks of XML, which is what you get when you seek to an arbitrary line in the file and try parsing from there. Since the SAX parser can accept a stream, I think I need to divide my XML file into eight different streams, each containing [number of rows]8 rows and padded with fake opening and closing tags. How would I go about doing this Or  is there a better solution that I might be missing Thank youp

Negative 80 pAt the moment were aggregating our javascript files and putting a far future expiry on them, so returning users get the benefit of having the file cached. Then we change the filename when we have updates, so we know theyll get the new one.p  pHow would that work with an AMD loader Were moving to Dojo, which is why I ask about that specifically. I know I could move everything into a new directory with a version number and modify the dojo config, but it feels like that means Id have to say everything is updated, instead of just targeting the things that actually were. p  pId like it to happen as automatically as possible, of course. Seems like we might have to pass a version number from the build process or something, but Im not seeing how the pieces come together yet.p

Negative 80 pI am used to writing things in html and one of the things I commonly do is make partially transparent patterns so that I can just change the background color instead of having to make a separate image for each color. I was wondering if there was something similar I can do on the Android. Right now I have a small image 5x5 pixels that I repeat using an xml file in the drawables folder. It is used in the background of a scroll view which right now has a linear layout inside. Switching to a relative layout so that I can have an imageview would require a lot of programming changes so Im wondering if there isnt an easier way.p  pEverywhere I have looked for a solution, the answers are a year or two old and they say to use two separate views, but it just seems like this is something that should have been implemented by now. And yes from a programming standpoint changing colors is just as easy as changing images, but it would just be a lot easier to be able to change the color instead of having to make an image for each new color.p

Negative 80 pIn a Trunk Based Development branching model, where you develop on the trunk and release from a branch, every release requires updates to POM files in both the trunk and the new branch.p  pFor example, if the version in the trunk is set to 1.0SNAPSHOT, the release branch needs to be updated to 1.0, and the trunk to 1.1SNAPSHOT.p  pId really like an alternative strategy to preclude the need to update the version on the trunk, and all the associated tasks that goes with this. Thinking about it, you shouldnt really need to apply a version number to the trunk. The version number only really becomes relevant during the release process, but Maven for a multitude of good reasons requires a version number. p  pAs an alternative, we could set the version on the trunk to 0.0SNAPSHOT, which would essentially denote a special build. The problem with this though, is that it would place it before every other version, as far as Maven is concerned.p  pAn alternative might be to use some very large number. This would at least place is after every other version, which is true if the trunk represents the tip of your development. This feels a bit arbitrary though.p  pThe only other option I can see, is to use a string version  e.g. HEAD or LATEST, but this wouldnt conform to the latest Maven versioning scheme. Besides losing the SNAPSHOT functionality, I believe that an integer version will always be considered newer than a string see a hrefhttpdocs.codehaus.orgdisplayMAVENVersioning relnofollowherea.p  pSo, p  ol liDoes the theory seem soundli liIf so, is there a better strategy out thereli ol

Negative 80 pOkay so I want to know the performance cost of chaining method calls repeatedly. For example if you are creating a game and you need to keep checking for collision detection, you would be calling methods the way I am thinking off.

Would this reduce performance significantly Thanksp

So the user can either Submit a new listing or Search for an existing one in the parameters entered. p  pThe problem for me is according to my Django book, searches should be done with the codeGETcode method, and Submits should be done with codePOSTcode. Also, where do I write the search functionality in the codeviews.pycode filep  pThis is what I want img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comEKTp0.jpg altSearch and Submitp

Using a double underscore instead is just as clear and almost as convenient, and eliminates the risk of accidentally interfering with either of these other use cases.p blockquote  pIve just started coding in Python and was wondering if the codecode is the accepted convention What is an example of code where codecode would cause an issuep  precodedirectory  key [0 for  in rangecatnum] for key in blasts codepre

Negative 80 pHi guys I have a small problem here. I am using Socket.io for a turn based card game. I have an array of player objects, I can access each players socket and use to send or receive events. I need to go through every playersocket, send them an event to tell them it is their turn, wait for them to take the turn lets say press a button on the screen and then on to the next player and so on. I made a couple of attempts but I know that socket.io is asynchronous and basically the loop continues to execute without actually waiting for any players to take turns. Any idea on how I could manage it To make it more clear of what I am trying to achieve I will demonstrate my last attempts. Thank youp  precodefori  0 i lt players.length i      players[i].getSocket.emityourTurn     players[i].getSocket.onturnTaken, functiondata          do something with the data          the loop then goes to the next player  codepre

I think I was saying thisp  pIm confused. The command codeterm xcode shows that codexcode is of type codeacode, and that codeacode is of sort codecode. Especially with hindsight here, and in comparison to what I got for codeterm xacode, a sort of codecode is not what I would expect for codeacode.

This kind of answer makes sense to me. Not that codeacode has to have the sort codetypecode, but that codeacode should at least have a sort, though my original motivation was to assure myself that the codeacode in a type class is of sort codetypecode.p  pFrom Lars answer, I am reminded that the type inference engine interprets a type as broadly as possible, so I assume thats at the core of this.p  pstrongUpdate 2strongp  pFrom Lars additional comment, it turns out, at least for me, that a key phrase in understanding codeacode is sort constraint, the constraint in sort constraint giving important meaning to codecode.p  pHeres some source for anyone whos interested in studying the subtleties of the language of types and sortsp  precodedeclare [[showsorts]] thm Pure.reflexive  xa  x [name Pure.reflexive]  thm HOL.refl        tatype  t [name HOL.refl]    Pure.reflexive  theorem xatype  x   byrule Pure.reflexive  theorem xprop  x   byrule Pure.reflexive  theorem xa  x   byrule Pure.reflexive   HOL.refl      theorem xatype  x   byrule HOL.refl     theorem xa  x   byrule HOL.refl ERROR Type unification failed Variable a not of sort type   LINE 47 HOL.thy where the use of type is defined.  setup  Axclass.classaxiomatization binding type, []  defaultsort type setup  ObjectLogic.addbasesort sort type  codepre

Negative 80 pIm working on a project with Flask and FlaskRestful, trying to get dynamic urls according to input from the user in my Restful API.  I created a class with a get method that will be responding to requests, and when the user calls upon another resource, it activates the new one and a url should be created.p  pThe problem comes when I try to add a new resource to my api, which calls the function setupmethod in Flask that checks if the app is in debug and if the first request was already made.p  precode if self.debug and self.gotfirstrequest      raise AssertionErrorA setup function was called after the       first request was handled. This usually indicates a bug       in the application where a module was not imported       and decorators or other functionality was called too late.n      To fix this make sure to import all your view modules,       database models and everything related at a central place       before the application starts serving requests. codepre  pOne simple way to overcome this would be to modify the addview function in Flask to avoid this behaviour.  I first want to understand why would you avoid a setup method like creating a view or in my case a resource after the first request is calledp

Negative 80 pbefore I start explaining, let me state this is not a pleasedomyhomework question. Ill post my code and assumptions or guessings, but Im asking for your assistance as I wasnt able to solve this, and found this matter not only intriguing, but also a good opportunity to learn very useful skills. This exercise is part of a homework task at my University, and deadline is already over. Why am I asking for help then Well, the teachers will only provide the results score, but not the actual explanation on how to solve the exercise its the University policy until the next period, the next year. I cant wait so long, Im very intrigued on how to solve this. This is a summary of the exercise speech theres certain isolated island in which they have their own language, but most people make syntax mistakes, so their governor decides to ask a developer to issue some piece of software which, observing their language rules, corrects the syntax. And these are the rulesp  ol liThe only characters in that language are the characters from g to p plus A, F, D, Q, X.li liEach character from g to p is a valid sentence.li liIf s is a valid sentence, then As is valid too.li liIf s and t are valid sentences, then Fst, Dst, Qst and Xst are valid sentences as well.li liRules from 1 to 4 are the only valid rules to determine the correct syntax.li ol  pAnd this was not clear enough for many of us, so we asked the teacher about points 3 and 4, and he explained as s is not actually a valid sentence, that was just an example they wanted to mean that A can be followed only by 1 lower case character, and F, D, Q and X can be followed only by 2 valid lower case caracters.p  pAlright, that may not sound so much complicated to a lot of you who know about regular expressions. Actually we werent taught regular expressions, only JUnit nothing to do with it well, the thing is this exercise is actually part of a JUnit workshop, and yes, Im as surprised as you. Then, why am I bringing up the regular expresions subject Well, the teacher commented that some student suggested him this exercise could be easily solved using regular expressions.p  pIm developing in Java using NetBeans, and I will post the most important part of the code I have so farp  precodePattern patronUno  Pattern.compile[ghijklmnop] Pattern patronDos  Pattern.compileA[ghijklmnop]A Pattern patronTres  Pattern.compile[FDQX][ghijklmnop]2,2 Pattern patronCuatro  Pattern.compile[A][FDQX]  public String validarString sentencia             Matcher coincidenciaUno  patronUno.matchersentencia     Matcher coincidenciaDos  patronDos.matchersentencia     Matcher coincidenciaTres  patronTres.matchersentencia     Matcher coincidenciaCuatro  patronCuatro.matchersentencia      ifcoincidenciaUno.matches  coincidenciaDos.matches                   coincidenciaTres.matches  coincidenciaCuatro.matches         return YES     else         return NO  codepre  pAnd my first testing cases I have, preapproved by the teachers, arep  pExample IN  Example OUTp  ul liFg          NOli liXij         YESli liAXij        YESli liDklm        NOli ul  pNow, AXij is valid, because A is valid per s, and Xij is also valid, so adding Xij to A is like adding a single one character valid sentence to it. And that my friends, is the part of the exercise I havent been able to deal with as I couldnt learn if there is a way to how to join two valid sentences. Could you help me on that part of the requirementp  pWith that code I posted, Im getting these resultsp  pExample IN    Example OUTp  ul liFg            NOli liXij           YESli liAXij          NOli liDklm          NOli liAAg           YESli liAA            YESli liAm            YESli liAmp           NOli liAmng          NOli ul  pI cant get AXij to be considered as a valid sentence, for example. However I could successfully validate Fx as invalid, Xij as valid, Dklm as invalid, etc.p  pThanks in advance for your help.

Negative 80 pI currently have one method that is running on my SERVER SIDE that returns a randomly generated string that looks like thisp  precodepublic String returnString         String randString  nextSessionId         return randString        codepre  pOn my CLIENT SIDE I have a method that asks for a randomString from the SERVER, encrypts it with the clients key, seals it in a SealedObject and then replies with the SealedObject, it looks like thisp  precodepublic boolean validateClientString loggedInKey throws Exception       Testing      String randString  this.aI.returnString  Client requests a string server returns     System.out.printlnThis is what the server gave me randString      String encryptionKey  loggedInKey     SecretKeySpec key  new SecretKeySpecencryptionKey.getBytesUTF8, AES      Cipher ecipher  Cipher.getInstanceAES     ecipher.initCipher.ENCRYPTMODE, key      SealedObject sealedClientReply  new SealedObjectrandString, ecipher  Client encrypts returned string seals it     System.out.printlnThis is what Im sending back sealedClientReply     ifthis.aI.clientValidatesealedClientReply, loggedInKey         System.out.printlnClient validated         return true     else         return false              codepre  pI then have a method on my SERVER that takes this SealedObject, unseals it and uses the Clients key that it shares with it to decrypt the SealedObject, hopefully producing the same key that the Server sent to the client, it looks like thisp  precodepublic boolean clientValidateSealedObject sealedClientReply, String loggedInKey throws Exception       String encryptionKey  loggedInKey     SecretKeySpec key  new SecretKeySpecencryptionKey.getBytesUTF8, AES      Cipher dcipher  Cipher.getInstanceAES     dcipher.initCipher.DECRYPTMODE, key      sealedClientReply.getObjectdcipher  Server decrypts object     System.out.printlnI received this from the client sealedClientReply     String decryptedClientReply String sealedClientReply.getObjectdcipher     System.out.printlnThis is what I received decrypted decryptedClientReply       ifdecryptedClientReply.equalsrandString       return true     else       return false          return true  codepre  pIn my mind this approach worked great, and was very secure. However I now have one major flaw. As you can see in the commented out code in the last method, the decryptedClientReply cannot equal the randString, because the method that is doing this compare doesnt actually know what randString the server sent to the client in the first place.p  pIf I pass the randString into this method, is it still secure If it is not secure is there another way I could carry out this symmetric approachp

Negative 80 pIm doing stress test on Cassandra. And I learn that using strongring cachestrong can improve the performance because the client requests can directly go to the target Cassandra server and the coordinator Cassandra node is the desired target node. In this way, there is no need for coordinator node to route the client requests to the target node, and maybe we can get the linear performance increment. p  pHowever, in my stress test on a Amazon EC2 cluster, the test results are weird. Seems that theres no performance improvement after using ring cache.

However recently I found Luaxe project, that seems to be a fullfeatured Lua backend for Haxe and was developed as pure Haxe library. I looked at the code of the project and it is using some kind of macro magic to generate Lua source code at compile time. So I would like to ask is it possible to implement a fullfeatured backend in pure Haxe without digging into OCaml and rebuilding the compiler If so is there any limitations Is there any good article on how to implement a backend in pure Haxep

Negative 80 pI have a SharpDX project that is very near completion. It uses a Kinect for interaction. Because of this my project uses WPF both for the Kinect region and the KinectUserViewer object. SharpDX has worked great for everything so far, however, when it gets to a certain part of the program that uses direct3D heavily, it begins to flicker. This is apparently connected to the fact that D3Dimage utilized by the SharpDXElement in MainWindow.xaml may be fundamentally broken and unsuitable for efficient D3D rendering in WPF a hrefhttpsgithub.comsharpdxSharpDXissues118 relnofollow[1]a.

Negative 80 pA few days back I wrote question regarding MIDI and ALSA, but Ive since solved the problem and run into a new one. p  pthe context in shortp  pemI have a Beaglebone Black with debian 7.5 on it.emp  pemMy host is a 32bit Ubuntu 14.10 installation.emp  pemIm using Qt4.8.6 for arm crosscompilation.emp  pemI am trying create an application which uses a touchscreen and also reads MIDI input from a keyboard. Ive used the following tutorial a hrefhttpembedded.vonkannen.net20140521qt486onbeagleboneblack relnofollowhttpembedded.vonkannen.net20140521qt486onbeagleboneblacka to install Qt embedded so I can crosscompile to my beaglebone Tutorial needs some fixes, Ive got a fixed doc ready if anyone needs one and the following one to compile ALSA for use on an ARM MPU omappedia.orgwikiALSASetupemp  pBasically after I finally got the program building and deploying onto my beaglebone black it couldnt find the port it needs to receive the MIDI signals.p  pIm using a a hrefhttpwww.esiaudio.comproductsmidimate2 relnofollowMidiMate IIa to connect the MIDI device Im using to a USB port on a HUB in my Beaglebone Black.p  pI have the following code to check for available ports strongCstrongp  precodeRtMidiIn  midiin  0  RtMidiIn constructor try    midiin  new RtMidiIn  catch  RtMidiError amperror     error.printMessage   exit EXITFAILURE    Check inputs. unsigned int nPorts  midiingtgetPortCount qDebug ltlt nThere are  ltlt nPorts ltlt  MIDI input sources available.n stdstring portName for  unsigned int i0 iltnPorts i     try      portName  midiingtgetPortNamei      catch  RtMidiError amperror       error.printMessage     delete midiin      stdcout ltlt   Input Port  ltlt i1 ltlt   ltlt portName ltlt n  codepre  pI can confirm that the MidiMate functions properly with Ubuntu.

Negative 80 pI have been looking around and cant seem to find something that matches my needs, was hoping someone here would know of either a built in framework object or something to help with the task.p  pI am attempting to read data from a Bluetooth Biometric sensor device, and can successfully pair and connect to the device with no problem, as well as read data over the SPP.

However I feel that if I were to do this, that I should change the codeReadcode call to a codeReadBytecode call so that I specifically timestamp each byte, not each collection of bytes with potentially different timestamps with the same timestamp bc I read them at one time.

Negative 80 pIm having an incredibly difficult time styling Twitter Typeaheads search bar. Adding the Typeahead javascript seems to add three new classes to my search bar, code.twittertypeaheadcode, code.tthintcode, and code.ttinputcode, which each behave in different, bizarre ways.p  pFirst, the background of the search bar was set to transparent after I added Typeahead, even though I had set it to white with a different class, so I had to add a white background wrapper, which contains all three new classes. Giving code.typeaheadcode codewidth 100 height100 borderradius 20pxcodefits it to the borderradius and height of the wrapper, but its about 50px shorter than the wrapper. code.ttinputcode fits the height and width perfectly, but its apparently what is making the background transparent, because the about 50px of discrepancy between code.ttinputcode and code.twittertypeaheadcode is the color of the background, not the white wrapper. Finally, code.tthintcode obeys only the color. Its white, but it doesnt respond when I try to set the borderradius, height, or width.p  pIf explicitly setting the attributes of these classes doesnt appear to work to style them, I have to conclude that there are other classes in play that I cant find. That, or theres a bug in Typeaheads code.p  pHas anyone run into anything like this Does anyone know why the three classes might not be responding to the css Im at my wits end.p

Negative 80 pIm stuck on implementing a mongodb structure.p  pIm have a relational database background and having some problems to make the switch to mongodb in that way that I doubt if Im making the good choices for the database scheme.  What I have is a unit that has a couple of thing like a serial number, version nr, etc. And that unit sends samples to a server that should be saved as well. A sample contains of a time stamp, the measurement value, battery voltage, etc. p  pSo what I implemented so far is 2 collections in the same db, units and measurements. That both have the same serial number so I have a virtual link between them. The problem I have is that the query time takes too long. Because all querying involves looking up the serial number, I added an index on the serial number. Still takes too long. To look up the data I now query both collections separately using the serial number. Is there a better way of querying my databasep  pOn the other hand, is this the right approach or should I completely redraw my designp

Negative 80 pstrongUpdatestrong I was emmistakenem about codetop 100 percentcode generating a better query plan the plan is still much better for a reasonably sized codetop Ncode, and probably has to do with parameter sniffing.p  pWhile I still think this focused question has merit, it is not a useful solution for my problemsup2sup, and might not be for yours ..p  hr  pI am running into some queries which SQL Server optimizes poorly.

The expected intermediate result is only expected to be a few dozen to a few hundred records.

Negative 80 pSo, lets say I want to recode some PNG to JPEG in Java. The image has extreme resolution, lets say for example 10 000 x 10 000px. Using standard Java image API Writers and Reader, you need at some point to have entire image decoded in RAM, which takes extreme amount of RAM space hundreds of MB. I have been looking how other tools do this, and I found that ImageMagick uses disk pixel storage, but this seems to by way too slower for my needs. So what I need is tru streaming recoder. And by true streaming I mean read and process data by chuncks or bins, not just give stream as input but decode it whole beforehand.p  pNow,  first the theory behind  is it even possible, given JPEG and PNG algorithms, to do this using streams, or lets say in bins of data So there is no need to have entire image encoded in memoryor other storage In JPEG compression, first few stages could be done in streams, but I believe Huffman encoding needs to build entire tree of value probabilities after quantization, therefore it needs to analyze whole image  so whole image needs to be decoded beforehand, or somehow on demand by regions.p  pAnd the golden question, if above could be achieved, is there any Java library that can actually work in this way And save large amount of RAMp

I want to use codex2.0.jarcode and codey1.0.jarcode but codey1.0.jarcode depends on codex1.0.jarcode.p  pThere is a tool out there which allows you to bundle up dependencies into a single JAR and change the package names internally so it avoids conflict. For example, if x contains software in the package com.foo, then it can change all classes in codex1.0.jarcode to be in package old.com.foo, as well as any references in codey1.0.jarcode, so we could make a new JAR codexy1.0.jarcode this JAR would not contain any publiclyexposed classes in the com.foo packages, so that we could feel free to use it alongside codex2.0.jarcode with no conflict.p  pThe problem is, I have totally forgotten what the name of that tool is We considered using it once in my company, but my management were concerned about doing binarylevel modifications to classes. However now several years later we have a similar problem which only affects test code, so I want to propose it again. But I have totally forgotten the namep  pThings I remember about itp  ul liOpen source hosted on Google Codeli liBased on ObjectWeb ASM underneathli liI think the name may have been a pun of some descriptionli ul  pDoes anyone know what tool this might be Please help me outp

Negative 80 pIve created an Android project which is being stored on GitHub as a public repository. The project contains an API key which shouldnt be made viewable to the public.

Negative 80 pI have a feature branch and want to alter previous commit message. There I perform a commandp  precodegit commit amend codepre  pIt works as expected when the commit is not pushed yet and so a new commit is created and replaced with the previous one locally. However, if the commit is pushed to remote branch then a diverged branch version is created and therefore I see 1 pull and 1 push. Therefore I need to make commit merge which actually merges altered commit into feature branch by creating completely new commit. However, I dont need this redundant commit.p  pI know we should never alter commits in public branches, however its my personal feature branch which I use for pushing and sometimes working from home, therefore I need to push. So the question is, is it expected behaviour or Im missing something and thats why Im asked to perform merge commitp

Negative 80 pIm currently developing a multiproject Scala application in IntelliJ IDEA 14 with SBT. Projects have dependencies emdependency projectsem between them and I need IntelliJ IDEA to inspect code from all projects, at least, from the projects I use from the current project emworking projectem. I need IntelliJ IDEA to update this inspection e.g. syntax highlighting automatically after a change in a dependency project.p  pThis is what Ive triedp  ul lipIve tried to add a project as a library but the problem is that IntelliJ IDEA seems not to recognize the .scala files and packages. pli lipIve also tried to set a compiled .jar of the working project as a library and set sbt in the dependency project to package the project into a .jar file every time I change a file running codepackagecode in the sbt console of the dependency project. But it seems that this daemon prevents IntelliJ IDEA from reading the newly created .jar file in the working project. If I package the project manually after making a change, it works properly I get code inspection and classes are loaded properly.pli lipIve tried SBT MultiProject too but while this settings work for compiling the working project and the dependecy project, I dont get the IntelliJ IDEA code inspection that I need, everything that is not in the working project is highlighted in red.

Negative 80 pI am developing with Crossrider an extension at the moment. I am now in the process of making it working also on IE and Chrome. The extension adds an IFrame to every page as a sidebar and from the iframe interacts with the parent window. To make this work I use Crossriders recommendation of using a data encoded block for the iframe instead of a URL to work around the same domain issue for security.p  pThis works in Firefox and with some hacking also in IE, however in Chrome i have the following issuesp  blockquote   pBlocked a frame with origin null from accessing a crossorigin   frame.p blockquote  pFrom what I read the only way around it is to actually be on the same domain not possible as the plugin works for every website or use cross window messaging because of a rich interaction we have with the parent a lot of overhead. So my question is, how can I configure override or whatever to fix this for Chrome, is there a way As a quick work around it can even be a setting I have to do in chrome. p  pBut in general I think there should be a way around this because in the end I already have full access to the browser because the extension is installed, so I assume I should be able to override this somehowp

Negative 80 pI have a task at hand which conceptually simplifies to adding a constant number to each element in a 13M element, 25MBsized array which does not fit into the cache 20MB in size. Thus my implementation is a for loop iterating through array indices. I used Intel Threading Building Block TBB to parallelize the task on an Intel Xeon E series server with the following specp  pcode20 CPUscode codeSandy Bridge Microarchitecturecode  code32K L1D, 256K L2, 20M L3code p  pThere are two possible parallelization schemes. On the one hand, I can implement this using the parallelfor template function in Intel TBB, in which the Blockrange object assists in breaking the array into chunks. On the other hand, I can choose to manually breaking the array into chunks and call each of the chunks a task, which can be passed to TBBs pipeline pattern.   p  pTo my surprise, the execution time measured using Oprofile under fixed chunk size of 10000 about L2 cache size for both implementations differ significantly. The simpler parallelfor function processed at 200MBs while the more complex pipeline pattern processed at 600MBs. Varying grainsize 1,000,000 to 10, with decrement of a factor of 10 each time. for parallelfor does not vary the data processing rate much. Varying chunksize for pipeline pattern changes the processing rate and these changes can be correlated with the sizes of L1, L2 and L3 caches.p  pAm I using parallelfor with a wrong grainsize Or is pipeline inherently faster than parallelfor Is it generally recommended to use parallelfor or pipeline when both manually and automatically segmenting the array are possible What are the advantages and disadvantages of replacing parallelfor with pipelinep  pThanks, Gup

Negative 80 pI developed a SharePoint Provided Hosted App which is deployed to an Office 365 SharePoint site for testing purposes.

Lets imagine Im calculating something in the MainStore. Before the calculation I need to show notification calculation has started. And after the calculation show calculation has finished. I have a NotificationComponent which takes the notification text from the NotificationStore. So to show the notification I can trigger the SHOWNOTIFICATIONACTION and pass the text of the notification to this action, so the NotificationStore will catch it and set it to its state and NotificationComponent will be rerendered and notification will appear.p  pThe problem is that I cant fire an action while other is in process. So if Ive already fired CALCULATEACTION I cant fire SHOWNOTIFICATIONACTION. Of course I can catch the CALCULATEACTION in the NotificationStore. But then I will be able to show only one notification  If Ill wait for the MainStore then notification will be after the calculations in the MainStore, otherwise  before.  And one more question what if I need to show notification in the middle of the calculationp  pMy task is a bit abstract and I have more realistic one, but a lot of context should be explained so Ive simplified the task to this example.p  pDoes anybody has any ideasp  pAny help would be highly appreciatedp

Negative 80 pI am trying to implement a custom multipage dialog that takes an arbitrary number of visuals slides and displays them.  The desired behavior would be that the selected item would appear at the topcenter of the display area in the foreground.  The previous slide would be at the bottomleft with a lower zindex, and the next slide would be at the bottomright with a lower zindex.  Previous and Next buttons would set the selected index.  In the set method for the index, I loop through the slides and set an integer value called SelectionState based on whether each slide is hidden, selected, just before the selected one, or just after the selected one.  I am trying to position the slides based on this integer using IValueConverters.p  pFor my Listbox.ItemsPanelTemplate, I tried using a Grid.  In the ItemsTemplate, I was setting the Grid.Column and Grid.Row using IValueConverters.  Stepping through code, I can see that the value converters are being called, and that they are returning appropriate values, but all items appear in row 0, column 0 anyway.p  pAfter getting frustrated, I tried changing the Grid to a Canvas and setting the Canvas.Left and Canvas.Top properties, and again, I can see that I am getting good values back from the converter, but all items position themselves in the topleft corner anyway. This code is shown, but commented outp  pSince I know the value converters are behaving as expected, does anybody else see what I am doing wrong  Thank you in advance for any suggestionsp  precodeltGrid xNameDialogLayergt         ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt             ltRowDefinition Height gt             ltRowDefinition Height420 gt             ltRowDefinition Height gt         ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt         ltGrid.ColumnDefinitionsgt             ltColumnDefinition Width gt             ltColumnDefinition Width1100 gt             ltColumnDefinition Width gt         ltGrid.ColumnDefinitionsgt          ltListBox xNamelbSlides ItemsSourceBinding CurrentFormSet.InterviewSlides Grid.Column1 Grid.Row1 ScrollViewer.HorizontalScrollBarVisibilityHidden ScrollViewer.VerticalScrollBarVisibilityHiddengt             ltListBox.ItemsPanelgt                 ltItemsPanelTemplategt                     ltGridgt                         ltGrid.ColumnDefinitionsgt                             ltColumnDefinition Width250 gt                             ltColumnDefinition Width250 gt                             ltColumnDefinition Width100 gt                             ltColumnDefinition Width250 gt                             ltColumnDefinition Width250 gt                         ltGrid.ColumnDefinitionsgt                         ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt                             ltRowDefinition Height60 gt                             ltRowDefinition Height300 gt                             ltRowDefinition Height60 gt                         ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt                     ltGridgt                     ltltCanvas Grid.Row1 Grid.Column1 gtgt                 ltItemsPanelTemplategt             ltListBox.ItemsPanelgt             ltListBox.ItemTemplategt                 ltDataTemplategt                     ltltBorder BorderBrushBlack BorderThickness1 Width600 Height360 Canvas.TopBinding SelectionState, ConverterStaticResource SelectionStateToCanvasTopConverter Canvas.LeftBinding SelectionState, ConverterStaticResource SelectionStateToCanvasLeftConverter Panel.ZIndexBinding SelectionState, ConverterStaticResource SelectionStateToZIndexConvertergt                         ltTextBlock TextHello World gt                     ltBordergtgt                     ltBorder BorderBrushBlack BorderThickness1 Width600 Height360 Grid.ColumnBinding SelectionState, ConverterStaticResource SelectionStateToGridColumnConverter Grid.RowBinding SelectionState, ConverterStaticResource SelectionStateToGridRowConverter Panel.ZIndexBinding SelectionState, ConverterStaticResource SelectionStateToZIndexConvertergt                         ltTextBlock TextHello World gt                     ltBordergt                 ltDataTemplategt             ltListBox.ItemTemplategt         ltListBoxgt     ltGridgt codepre
