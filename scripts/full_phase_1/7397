Positive 7397 pSo, Im attempting to create an easier way for my clients to create a new patient record if there is no existing patient based on the Opportunity Creation.  If there is no existing patient, the users can enter the patients first amp last names into separate fields and save the record. A Process then runs to create the patient record simultaneously with the Opportunity record that was just created.p  pstrongMy question is.... Is there any work around to have that newly created patient record update the Patient field lookup record on that opportunity without me having to go in and do it manuallystrongp  pI have tried work flows, validation rules, process builder, etc... and cant find any solution to this since SalesForce doesnt allow for updates of Lookup Fields.p

Positive 7397 pI am using the SalesForce Partner API, not the Enterprise API. I want to be able to programatically C add a custom field to any object in SalesForce as an External ID so I can merge data from external systems into the SalesForce object. I know there is a way to do this with the MetaData API, but Ive also seen a number of references that suggest its possible through the Partner API, which would be far better because we dont need to spin up yet another API connection to achieve this.p  pThere seems to be no information about this anywhere. I cant find anything on the SalesForce.com help website or anywhere else on the internet and although mentioned in other posts, it doesnt appear that anybody has posted information about how to do it, or not that I can find anyway.p  pCan anybody point me in the right direction Some sample code or a link to an article somewhere describing how to do itp  pThanks very much.p

Positive 7397 pMy program has 2 activities, SFActivity which extends a SuperClass and gets the data from the DB and GameActivity that should get the data from SFActivity with a Launcher class that extends Application.

Negative 7397 pi will be working on a project that tries to determine your position using the wifi signal strength from a few access points. i was wondering if anyone knew of any similiar projects or any articles on that topicp  pif anyone cares its a research project in at my university. the app is written is used as a playing ground to develop new wifi antenna that are better suited for this type of usage. i only work on the coding part of the project though. oh and its written using c which is not optionalp  phr p  pclarification its ONLY wifi. no GPS goodnes for us becaus its supposed to work indoors the software is supposed to determine your location by using the known locations of the access points and their signal strenghts to tell you where you are. its currently at around 45 meters of accuracy aside from that i already have a working prototype and was just wondering if anything similiar has been done before or if anyone has any tips or ideas forabout the projectp

Negative 7397 pHow do you add a row listener to a specific row, or all rows in a table  I need to add a type of onMouseOver listener to the rows so that when you hover over them, it changes the background color of the row, much like getRowFormatter will allow you to do.p
Negative 7397 pIm using StarTeam 4.1 and Im trying to use the command line version of StarTeam to checkout all the files of the folder.  But for some reason, instead of checking out to CInstallation, it checks out to C400Installation.  In the GUI, StarTeam clearly states that the complete working folder path is CInstallation.  If I run stcmd.exe and try to checkout a single file from the root of Installation, it says that there is no such file, while I can check it out from the GUI.  stcmd.exe also does not display all the subfolders of Installation.  Any idea why this might be happeningp
Negative 7397 pIve been working on an economy simulator in Java and ran into a roadblock. I have an emEconomyem class that owns a vector of emTradersem. Every iteration, the Economy class calls each emTraderem to update and decide what trades it would like to place. The update function returns the desired transactions to be added to the queue in the parent emEconomyem class. I was able to implement all of the above correctly, but I still need each emTraderem to be able to see how many trades he currently has open. Since the trades are stored in the parent emEconomyem class, how should I design the code so that the emTradersem do have access to emEconomyem functions and variablesp

Negative 7397 pI want to change it from one database to another.p  pThere dont appear to be any options to do this on the pivot table context menup
Negative 7397 pThe project on which Im currently working has two codedatagridviewscode that are meant to compare two versions of similar data same number and name of columns. Id like to resize all the columns so that they fit two criteriap  p1 Autosize to fit data thats easyp  p2 So the columns are lined up such that for any column COL,  codegridA[COL].Width  MaxgridA[COL].Widthcode, codegridB[COL].Widthcode, and the same for codegridB[COL].Widthcodep  pThe problem Im encountering is, when you do an autoresize, the codeWidthcode property doesnt show you the ACTUAL width it displays the width before the autoresize, I guess.p
Negative 7397 pOk, Ill try and keep this short, sweet and tothepoint.p  pWe do massive GeoIP updates to our system by uploading a MASSIVE CSV file to our PHPbased CMS. This thing usually has more than 100k records of IP address information. Now, doing a simple import of this data isnt an issue at all, but we have to run checks against our current regional IP address mappings.p  pThis means that we must validate the data, compare and split overlapping IP address, etc.. And these checks must be made for each and every record. p  pNot only that, but Ive just created a field mapping solution that would allow other vendors to implement their GeoIP updates in different formats. This is done by applying rules to IPs records within the CSV update. p  pFor instance a rule might look likep  pif countryName  Australia then send to the Australian IP Poolp  pThere might be multiple rules that have to be run and each IP record must apply them all. For instance, 100k records to check against 10 rules would be 1 million iterations not fun.p  pWere finding 2 rules for 100k records takes up to 10 minutes to process. Im fully aware of the bottleneck here which is the shear amount of iterations that must occur for a successful import just not fully aware of any other options we may have to speed things up a bit.p  pSomeone recommended splitting the file into chunks, serverside. I dont think this is a viable solution as it adds yet another layer of complexity to an already complex system. The file would have to be opened, parsed and split. Then the script would have to iterate over the chunks as well. p  pSo, question is, considering what I just wrote, what would the BEST method be to speed this process up a bit Upgrading the servers hardware JUST for this tool isnt an option unfortunately, but theyre pretty highend boxes to begin with.p  pNot as short as I thought, but yeah. Halps p

Negative 7397 pWe have SOAP implementations of our services and up till now we had some legacy code that was wrapping our args and returns in another object to get around some serialization  generics on RPC methods.p  pAfter optimization, we had implemented this class so that it Json serialized DataContractJsonSerializer and GZipped our complex request params and response objects.p  pI now want to push this stuff down into the WCF stack. What I really want is the ability to encode the message body as GZipped Json on a standard SOAP service. We need transactional support and security etc so we need to be able to support the standard bindings.p  pI have managed to implement an Operation Behavior to Json serialize so that the message infoset will contain json compatible XML.

Negative 7397 pSo for my current project, there are basically three main Java classesp  ol liGUIli liInstant Messagingli liComputationli ol  pEssentially, there needs to be full communication, so weve decided to use the mediator approach rather than than allow the GUI to run the entire project.p  pBasically, the mediator is going to encapsulate the communication. The problem weve run into is how to allow the GUI components to update without building a ton of methods for the mediator to call anytime something completes.p  pEx. Say the GUI wants to log in the user, it goes through the mediator to create a thread and log in, but then the mediator has to relay the successfailure back to GUI as well as update a status message.p  pThe other issue is things that need to update the GUI but do not need the moderator. Is it practical to just allow the GUI to create an instance of that class and run it or should everything go through the mediatorp  pOur original design just had the GUI managing everything, but it really killed reusability. Is there a better design method to use in this casep

Negative 7397 pIm quite new to the C combo with ASP.NET, so ill try to be as clear as i can with my explanation.p  pIm using a GridView to display some columns and rows that reside in a database. This works excellent. Because i wanted to add columns dynamically out of a List of names. Lets say we have a list with 5 names in it, then it dynamically creates a column for every name in the GridView. Heres some code to display what i dop  precodeprotected void PageLoadobject sender, EventArgs e      if IsPostBack              Create columns for each student         ListltStudentgt allStudents  new Eetlijst.Business.Students.GetAll         allStudents.Reverse          foreach Student student in allStudents                      StudentBoundField studentField  new StudentBoundField             studentField.HeaderText  student.Naam             MaaltijdGrid.Columns.Insert4, studentField                   ShowDataInGridDateTime.Now.Month, DateTime.Now.Year codepre  pTheres some other stuff in there that isnt important. The ShowDataInGrid looks as followingp  precodepublic void ShowDataInGridint maand, int jaar      ListltMaaltijdgt allMaaltijden  new Eetlijst.Business.Maaltijden.GetByMonthAndYearmaand, jaar     Session.Contents.Addmaaltijden, allMaaltijden      MaaltijdGrid.DataSource  allMaaltijden     MaaltijdGrid.DataBind  codepre  pHow do i create the dynamic columns for each row I create them with a DataBound event. So when the GridView databinds, the columns get filled with data. There is also a check inside to see if the row is in edit mode or not. So when i click on the edit button next to the row, the row goes perfectly in edit mode. The code i made adds a TextBox control to the cell. When i fill in a value and press the Update button, it cant find any controls anymore and therefore i cant get the value i entered. The control is still there in the DataBound when i put a break point after it. But as soon as i click the Update button, all the controls of the cells are gone.p  pI searched on the internet and all i found is that it has something to do with the application firing a postback before it reaches the RowUpdating method.p  pSo, how can i let the controls exist that i added to the cell when it is in edit modep  pIf anyone needs the code thats inside the DataBound event ill post it.p

Table2 is now Drivers. Table3 is now Cars.p  pPretend I am writing an insurance application. The relation of these tables will exactly match what Im trying to do.p  pEach house can have one or more driver, and each driver has exactly one car. Right now, Im just trying to get it working with one house, one driver, and one car. The user should first see a form called HouseInformation which will ask them to fill in information about their house. Then they will see DriverInformation which will ask them to fill in information about themselves. Then they will see CarInformation which will ask them to fill in information about their car. After they are done, there will be one record in each table. The record in Drivers will contain HouseId, matching the corresponding house, and the record in Cars will contain DriverId, matching the corresponding driver. I dont especially care how the forms are linked, just that they are and that it works reliably.p  pFor what its worth, Ive also tried numerous other methods of loading the form and setting its foreign key id. None of them have caused the form to pull in the data from the previous forms table, even though this exact pattern does work between the first two forms.p  hr  pstrongMore updatesstrongp  pSubforms are not acceptable to the client, who specifically requested separate forms.p  pI find this extraordinarily confusing, but after Form3 loads, if I close it, go into design view, open the query for Form3 and switch to datasheet view, the correct data is there, including the fields I want from Form2. It just wont show up on the form. I requeried. It makes no difference. It wont show up.p

I dont want any cart functionality or other such features, I just want to display the products,their specifications and images etc. on the website and give my client an admin panel to manage products.br Now I looked into various PHP shopping cart scripts but couldnt find a way to remove price info from the display. I am not experienced enough in web development to make a product catalogue from scratch so if you guys could point me out in right direction I would be very grateful. If you could give me link to some shopping cart or cataloguing script or any other way to accomplish the task it would help me out a lot..  p  pThanks in advance to all those who reply.p

Negative 7397 pI have a C dll reporting lots of useful information via console output using printf or cout. Im linking this dll to my GUI application written in MFC and want to access its output.p  pSounds pretty simple, yeah Well, I was surprised when after hours of searching internet and implementing several solutions none of them workedp  pSo maybe some additional information about application is needed. I have a huge host application to which I have no access. Actually, Im writing plugin to it. It links my plugin dll at runtime using LoadLibrary, I suppose. My dll at its turn uses external dll which output I want to acquire. This dll is linked to my statically via corresponding lib file, so CRT does all the loading.p  pAs far as I know, any application including all loaded in whatever way dlls has single stdout stream single stdin and single stderr. And thats when things are going too complicated for me. Ive tried to redirect this stdout stream obviously, for whole applicationprocess and in some cases it worked for MY dll, but it still doesnt work for EXTERNAL dll. I.e. if I use something like codecout ltlt Heycode from my dll, I can see this in file to which Ive redirected stream. However, the same call from inside external dll yes, I have its sources but I really dont want to change them does nothing. God knows where this output is done. p  pIve triedp  ol liGood old codefreopencode trick. Worked for my dll, no effect for external dll.li liWinAPI codeSetStdHandlecode call. Doesnt work at all.

Negative 7397 pI need some advice how we can decouple nHibernate dependencies in the presentation layer. Currently we have a three tier C winforms application consisting simplified of the following layersp  ul liUser Interface UIli liBusiness Logic BALli liData Access Logic DALli ul  pWe are migrating this application to an ORM nHibernate and would ideally like to have only the DAL referencing nHibernate. We also want to employ the Unit of Work functionality which is included in nHibernate, adopting a Session per conversation methodology. p  pTo achieve this we need to create and open a session in the UI, pass the session through the BAL to the DAL however we cannot achieve this without creating a dependency to nHibernate in both the BAL and DAL.p  pAny advice would be appreciated.

Negative 7397 pThis is my first question here so let me know if Im doing things wrongp  pI am building an Android application with Eclipse and am reading QR codes with the barcode reader. This is all working just fine, however, sometimes there are special case barcodes that contain a reward for the user.p  pThis reward is contained in a specially formatted string, this string COULD be tampered with by people who intend to cheat the system. This isnt a huge issue but I have implimented steps to prevent it, now my question is... How secure are these stepsp  pHere are two examples of the stringsp  precodeCodev1.031c8f90a405010010C1337 Codev1.06a9c4e8d92da1002C4D23A1BC1337 codepre  pThe strings are formatted like sop  precodeCodev1.0HASHCODEIDREDEEMONCECODEACTIONARG REDEEMONCE has 3 possible values codepre  pMy hashing system work like sop  precodesalt    didnt think it wise to post this, but the length is                              the same and its alphanumeric MD5  salt .  . codeParts[2] . codeParts[5] . codeParts[4] .  . codeParts[3] .  MD5 . codeParts[4] . codeParts[3] .  . codeParts[5] . codeParts[2] codepre  pIs this a secure way of doing this, the code cannot seem to be tampered without affecting the hash, but surely hashes can colide and if somebody worked out the hashing scheme it all becomes pointless this is a little less of a risk of just finding it as its on the server side, but if somebody figures it out.p  pWhat are your thoughtsp

My question comes from the fact we have one school but many Instructors, Pupils and lessons so when building a program we will need to display lists of these Objects. Therefore would a list of any of them be considered a class in its own right or when it comes to programming will it be necessary to create an instance for each Instructor, Pupil and lesson. Or am I missing something fundamental in the design of an OOP system.p  pAs I say, just working out OOP so please be gentle with me.p  pMany Thanks  Colinp  hr  pThanks everybody for the comments so far. The more I think about this the more I realise, at least for me. that a list of something in my system is an object. I imagine each item in a list will be a form, as it is now, so any selection of an item will result in a new script being run which will create a new instance of a Pupil, Instructor etc. along with executing methods for the new instance.p

Negative 7397 h2The Situationh2  pI have some trouble with my query execution plan for a mediumsized query over a large amount of data in Oracle 11.2.0.2.0. In order to speed things up, I introduced a range filter that does roughly something like thisp  precodePROCEDURE DOSTUFF     orgfrom VARCHAR2  NULL,     orgto   VARCHAR2  NULL     [...]   JOIN organisations org     ON cust.orgid  org.id    AND orgfrom IS NULL OR orgfrom lt org.no    AND orgto   IS NULL OR orgto   gt org.no    [...] codepre  pAs you can see, I want to restrict the codeJOINcode of codeorganisationscode using an optional range of organisation numbers. Client code can call codeDOSTUFFcode with supposed to be fast or without very slow the restriction.p  h2The Troubleh2  pThe trouble is, PLSQL will create bind variables for the above codeorgfromcode and codeorgtocode parameters, which is what I would expect in most casesp  precode   [...]   JOIN organisations org     ON cust.orgid  org.id    AND B1 IS NULL OR B1 lt org.no    AND B2 IS NULL OR B2 gt org.no    [...] codepre  h2The Workaroundh2  pOnly in this case, I measured the query execution plan to be a lot better when I just inline the values, i.e. when the query executed by Oracle is actually something likep  precode   [...]   JOIN organisations org     ON cust.orgid  org.id    AND 10 IS NULL OR 10 lt org.no    AND 20 IS NULL OR 20 gt org.no    [...] codepre  pBy a lot, I mean 510x faster. Note that the query is executed very rarely, i.e. once a month.

So I can imagine that this is not just a coincidence.pli lipAm I missing something Maybe there is an entirely other way to achieve query execution plan improvement, other than variable inlining note I have tried quite a few hints as well but Im not an expert on that fieldpli ul
Negative 7397 pIve noticed recently that there are a great many algorithms out there based in part or in whole on clever uses of numbers in creative bases.  For examplep  ul liBinomial heaps are based on binary numbers, and the more complex skew binomial heaps are based on skew binary numbers.li liSome algorithms for generating lexicographically ordered permutations are based on the factoradic number system.li liTries can be thought of as trees that look at one digit of the string at a time, for an appropriate base.li liHuffman encoding trees are designed to have each edge in the tree encode a zero or one in some binary representation.li liFibonacci coding is used in Fibonacci search and to invert certain types of logarithms.li ul  pMy question is strongwhat other algorithms are out there that use a clever number system as a key step of their intuition or proofstrong.

Negative 7397 pThe question is pretty much in the title in terms of OSlevel implementation, how are shared objects and dlls differentp  pThe reason I ask this is because I recently read a hrefhttpdocs.python.orgextendingwindows.htmldifferencesbetweenunixandwindowsthis pagea on extending Python, which statesp  blockquote   pUnix and Windows use completely different paradigms for runtime loading of code. Before you try to build a module that can be dynamically loaded, be aware of how your system works.p      pIn Unix, a shared object .so file contains code to be used by the program, and also the names of functions and data that it expects to find in the program. When the file is joined to the program, all references to those functions and data in the files code are changed to point to the actual locations in the program where the functions and data are placed in memory. This is basically a link operation.p      pIn Windows, a dynamiclink library .dll file has no dangling references. Instead, an access to functions or data goes through a lookup table. So the DLL code does not have to be fixed up at runtime to refer to the programs memory instead, the code already uses the DLLs lookup table, and the lookup table is modified at runtime to point to the functions and data.p blockquote  pCould anyone elaborate on that Specifically Im not sure I understand the description of shared objects containing references to what they expect to find. Similarly, a DLL sounds like pretty much the same mechanism to me.p  pIs this a complete explanation of what is going on Are there better ones Is there in fact any differencep  pI am aware of how to link to a DLL or shared object and a couple of mechanisms .def listings, dllexportdllimport for writing DLLs so Im explicitly not looking for a how to on those areas Im more intrigued as to what is going on in the background.p  pEdit another obvious point  Im aware they work on different platforms, use different file types ELF vs PE, are ABIincompatible etc...p

Negative 7397 pBrowsing the a hrefhttpwww.tkdocs.comTkDocsa website, it looks like Tk has come a long way in the native look and feel department. But looking at some of a hrefhttpwww.tkdocs.comtutorialfirstexample.htmlthese screenshotsa, it seems to be let down in Linux. If you scroll down that page, youll see a Mac screenshot that looks exactly like Mac, a Windows XP screenshot that looks exactly like Windows XP, and a Linux screenshot that looks like ... well Windows 98 or Windows XP with classic style.p  pI know Linux doesnt really have a native look and feel, since every toolkit does its own styling.

Negative 7397 pI have a GridView control which I am dynamically binding to a DataTable which is populated by a query built based on a set of selected options. p  pWhat I am trying to do is simply handle the RowDataBound event in order to format specific rows based on the value of a database field.

Negative 7397 pWe have a standalone product not browser based that uses Flash for some of its gui.  We let flash render to a windowless control then used that bitmap as a 3D texture where it is then displayed by directxp  pwe have traditionally taken advantage of the render it on black, then render it on white, and painfully extract the alpha info from the flash movie since we need the full alpha from the movie.p  pAs of flash 11, no matter what we prefill the bitmap to and we use wmodetransparent, flash now overwrites that with black, preventing us from extracting the alpha and leaving ugly black outlines everywhere.p  pWhile it would be great if Flash wmodetransparent just started working again, what would be even more fantastic would be if we could use wmodewindow and have flash directly provide the alpha into our target render bitmap.p  pBetter for flash, better for us.

Negative 7397 pI will admit that starting programming on your own as a newbie can seem a bit daunting. However after toying around very basically in both Python and currently C Im wondering if C may be more suitable for a hobbyist. By hobbyist I mean someone who foresees no real future in actually programming for a living but rather sees it at least currently as an interesting exercise. So while I would like to be able to do things Im dont really see myself yknow making a 3d game engine.p  pI know that I dont NEED to learn C to learn C. But from what Ive read a couple of people have said that C is easier to learn because its a smaller language. It seems like it would be more suitable to me given that, and I know that C is certainly fine for anything Id want to do with it, and thus not really need to learn or use it as a stepping stone for C. From what I can see C would be a Easier to program with, meaning easier to get in and make things and keep one interested. b lower level means more flexibility, whereas Python would be hindered perhaps by its high level nature. C Still widely used though perhaps not to the extent of Cp  pA lot of people ask about learning C to get to C but Im wondering more about Cs own merits in and of them self. I wonder if what Im thinking is true or if Ive been filled with misconceptions. Thanks for any help p
Negative 7397 pOk so I understand how to use the include tag but Ive run into a problem.p  pBasically I want to have a layout defined in xml which has a couple of textviews and an image view in it. I then want to iterate across an array and populate fields within the xml layout depending on whats in an arraywhich is populated on runtime. Thus making multiple copies of the xml layout and populating the fields with unique data. Now ive got no idea how you can reuse this linearlayout in this way as the textviews and imageviews within it have a constant id and I need to make multiple copies of this layout.p  pIs there any way to inflate a resource and then make a copy of it, that would work... So p  pLinearLayout one  new LinearLayoutinflater.inflateR.layout.home, container, falsep  p Theres no constructor like that unfortunately.p  pThe only other way is to do it all programatically but I would of preferred to have the properties of the views and the linearlayout in xml rather than in the code. Its like I want the linearlayout to be a template which you can make copies of I guess... Really not sure if thats possible.p  pThanksp

The div has a front div child and back div child, with the back div having codewebkittransform rotateY 180deg code set.p  pThe problem that once the parent element is rotated to display the back side of the div, it will only detect clicks of child elements on exactly one side of the div, specifically the second half of the div or right side. The front side div detects clicks on the entire face of element. Also, the zindexes are fine. I assume that the issue may be due to the rotation and the browser displaying one half of the side closer p  pThe code that this is breaking is extremely complex, so I created a test file to demonstrate the problem below. Im using a jQuery plugin I wrote for the 3D transformations, which can be found here a hrefhttpsgithub.compwhisenhuntjquery.transformblobmasterjquery.transform.js relnofollowhttpsgithub.compwhisenhuntjquery.transformblobmasterjquery.transform.jsa.p  pstrongEditstrong After experimentation, the clicking of the button element is only registering from 100200px and not from 0100px. In other words, it is in fact only registering on the second half of the div.p  pAny help is very much appreciatedp  precodelthtmlgt ltheadgt     ltstylegt         .element             width200             height200              webkitperspective 800             webkittransformstyle preserve3d                   .element figure            display block           height 100           width 100           position absolute           webkitbackfacevisibility hidden             border1px solid yellow                   .element .front              webkitborderradius8px             padding 0px             margin 0px             backgroundcoloryellow             zindex 9870                   .element .back              webkitborderradius8px             padding 0px             margin 0             webkittransform rotateY 180deg              zindex 0             border 1px solid red             backgroundcolorgreen              ltstylegt     ltscript srchttpajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjquery1.6.2jquery.min.jsgtltscriptgt             ltscript srchttpsraw.github.compwhisenhuntjquery.transformmasterjquery.transform.jsgtltscriptgt     ltscriptgt         function             var temp  false             .element.clickfunction                 iftemp  false                     this.transformsetAnimationDuration, 1.transformrotateY, 180                     this.unbindmouseenter mouseleave                     button  document.createElementdiv.attrid, button.css width 200, height 50, backgroundColorblue                      button.clickfunction                         console.logClicking                                          temp  true                     this.appendbutton                                            ltscriptgt ltheadgt ltbodygt     ltdiv classelementgt         ltfigure classfrontgtltfrontgt         ltfigure classbackgtltfrontgt     ltdivgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pstronga hrefhttpjsfiddle.net7AbWe relnofollowA JSFiddle Example of the Problem  Can be found HEREastrongp

Negative 7397 pIn WPF, I have a scrollviewer with 7 different groupboxes in it.  Each groupbox is its own individual section for different forms.  Because the scrollviewer is so long, Ive placed a series of buttons in a stackpanel on the left side of the panel, and done codebehind so that clicking a button triggers the BringIntoView method for the corresponding groupbox.p  pMy question is, is there any way to force BringIntoView to position the groupbox at the top of the visible section each time.  By default BringIntoView only moves the scrollviewer until the entire groupbox is within view, not so that its the topmost item displayed.  Is there a way around thisp  pI looked into using ScrollToVerticalOffset, but couldnt figure out how to get the right position, mostly because its saying that groupbox has no Locate property, which I was going to use to get the position, then set it with ScrollToVerticalOffset.  One thing I thought of while typing this was to have each buttonpress jusmp to the top groupbox first, then immediately continue to the correct one, but this seems kind of hackish, and I prefer to find the correct way.   p

I want to know if there is anyway to get the sockaddr, or port from just the SOCKETp  pI ran into a similar problem with a UDP socket but I fixed it by just getting the port number from the sockaddr when it was about to send data and updated my information about it.  But the problem is, I dont have anything to go off of besides the SOCKET.p  pThe program is making a SOCKET with port 0, and later on it assigns it to a new port.  By the time that happens my programs information on the socket is already set using port 0, which is not true.  So, I need to find a way to either... A Find the port based on the SOCKET, or B When windows updates the port, I can hook that and update the port.p

Negative 7397 pI have many large multidimensional NP arrays 2D and 3D used in an algorithm. There are numerous iterations in this, and during each iteration the arrays are recalculated by performing calculations and saving into temporary arrays of the same size. At the end of a single iteration the contents of the temporary arrays are copied into the actual data arrays.p  pExamplep  precodeglobal A, B  ndarrays Atemp  numpy.zerosA.shape Btemp  numpy.zerosB.shape for i in xrangenumiters      Calculate new values from A and B storing in Atemp and Btemp...      Then copy values from temps to A and B     A[]  Atemp     B[]  Btemp codepre  pThis works fine, however it seems a bit wasteful to copy all those values when A and B could just swap. The following would swap the arraysp  precodeA, Atemp  Atemp, A B, Btemp  Btemp, B codepre  pHowever there can be other references to the arrays in other scopes which this wont change.p  pIt seems like NumPy could have an internal method for swapping the internal data pointer of two arrays, such as codenumpy.swapA, Atempcode. Then all variables pointing to codeAcode would be pointing to the changed data.p

Would that a correct assumption Whats the best way to utilize full BW between two regular Linux machinespli ol  p5.Whats your favorite tool for measuring current bandwidth usage on interfaces This is probably just more of a preference, I looked at iptraf etc, but would like to see what others use and like most.p

Negative 7397 pIm working on a messaging app and I have a dilemma about how to send data from server to client.p  pIm using a centralized server design, where clients uses codeNSURLConnectioncode to send messages to the server, the server doesnt keep and manage open sockets and cant send a message for one of the clients. So clients use a timer and query the server every 2 seconds to see if new data is waiting for them.p  pThe problem with this approach is that polling the server every 2 second seem to kill the battery very fast, so I thought maybe instead of clients polling the server, to stronguse APNSstrong so when the server has some strongnew informationstrong  for the client, the server will send a strongpush notificationstrong emem  to the client, then the client will fetch the data from the server.p  pstrong use APNSstrong  if client allows it, client can of course disable this option. So I will check if push allowed every time the app enter foreground and if not Ill return to the polling approach.p  p  strongNew informationstrong can be anything from text messages to server admin messages. and there are a lot of admin messages...br For example, in my app users can see their friends status onlineoffline, so if user1 and user2 are friends, and user2 just change his status from online to offline, then server needs to send this new info admin message  user2offline to user1.p  pemstrongemstrong  strongThe push notificationsstrong server sends are empty with no datasound, its just a trigger for the client to fetch the new info, so if a push was sent to the client and the client app was close, he will not notice anything. if the app is running, then it will fetched the new info from serverp  pstrongWill this approach work with a massive messaging app requiring massive push notification usesstrongp  pTo be clearer my main concerns arebr 1. Is APNS reliable enough  that I can use it as my core servertoclient messaging mechanismbr 2. Will apple approve potentially thousands or hundreds of thousands push notifications a day from my serverp

So the question is Is there an complex algorithm to serialize values in similarly simple XML file into keyvalue form It has to be deterministically serializable and unserializable and no values can be lost. Order of elements doesnt matter Python dict in examples is not a random choice, its really what Im trying to get.p  pI know XMLs can be very complex namespaces, attributes, whatever, but this is not the case. The only problem I need to properly resolve is nested values as presented and related multiplicity of the same keys.p

Negative 7397 pI havent coded this bit up yet, because Im not sure of which is the best method to tackle this.p  pFor starters, what the program does now is simply put the names of all the files in the same directory as the program into an array of strings and then print that array out. p  pWhat I want to do is sort these by file extension. There will be a list of particular extensions for the user to choose from, after which all files with that extension in the folder will be returned to the user. p  pIm just not sure how to go about that. The first thing that comes to mind is to iterate through the vector and compare each string to another string with the desired extension, and if there is match then push that string into another vector that is specific for that file extension. There are only 5 extensions Im looking for so its not like I would have to make a whole ton of new vectors for each extension. p  pAlternativley I thought it might also make sense to never populate the original vector, and take the users request first and then iterate through the files and push all files with matching extensions into a specific vector. Once done if they choose another option the vector will simply be cleared and repopulated with the new file names.  p  pAny tips on how to go about actually doing the comparison, Im not that good with c syntax, also would it be wise to use a different type of containerp  pThanks a lot for any and all advice you guys are willing to throw my way, its greatly appreciatedp  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltfilesystemgt include ltvectorgt using namespace std using namespace stdtr2sys   void scan path f, unsigned i  0   string indenti,t cout ltlt indent ltlt Folder   ltlt systemcompletef ltlt endl directoryiterator d f  directoryiterator e  vectorltstringgtiterator it1  stdvectorltstringgt fileNames   for  d  e d       fileNames.pushbackdgtpath      print out conents without use of an array     cout ltlt indent ltlt          dgtpath ltlt isdirectory dgtstatus    [dir] ltlt         endl      if I want to go into subdirectories     if isdirectory dgtstatus           scan f  dgtpath, i  1    forit1  fileNames.begin it1  fileNames.end it1   cout ltlt it1 ltlt endl        int main      path folder  ..      cout ltlt folder ltlt isdirectory folder    [dir] ltlt endl      scan folder   codepre

Negative 7397 pGood evening, everyone. Im writing multithread program using Python 2.7 and emthreadingem module. Here is a code examplep  precode Importing myFunc function which will be run in the new thread from src.functions import myFunc  Importing a threading module import threading  Creating and running new thread initiated by our function  and some parameters. t  threading.ThreadtargetmyFunc, args1, 2, 3 t.start codepre  pI know that in C POSIX thread libraries there is a a hrefhttpwww.kernel.orgdocmanpagesonlinepagesman3pthreaddetach.3.html relnofollowpthreaddetacha function which puts a running thread in the detached state. It guarantees that this thread will release resources back to the system after the function ends. So, is there any analog of such function in Python Or, maybe, its not necessary to detach threads in Python at all, and the resources taken by the thread will be released automatically after the end of the threaded functionp  pI tried to search for information on a hrefhttpdocs.python.org2librarythreading.html relnofollowdocs.python.orga and Google but it was fruitlessly.p

Negative 7397 pSo I recently setup my Rackspace server Ubuntu LAMP stack to use Postfix and Sendgrid for outgoing email. It works great in that my test mail from the cmd line gets delivered via sendgrid smtp. However, when I receive the email it says its from coderootrackspaceservernamecode and I cannot reply to it. p  pI created an alias as per this topic a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9538817howtochangedefaultemailaddressforpostfixhow to change default email address for postfixa which makes it say codewebmastermydomain.comcode by the sender name which still appears as coderootcode.p  pWhat do I need to change to have the server use my webmaster email or at least make it appear thats where it is coming from and thus a reply would go to that emailp  pAny help is greatly appreciatedp

Negative 7397 pWCF is extremely extensible and has a lot of readytouse features, however I continue struggling with some topics and the more documentation I read, the more I get confused.p  pI hope to get some answers from the community. Feedback on any assumption or question is extremely welcome. p  pFor the record to really accept a single answer I should divide this post in multiple questions but it would lead to even more confusion. I am pretty sure there are some real WCF experts online who can answer the few questions in this document all at once so I can accept a single answer as the real deal to setup clientcertificate authentication using IIS the right way.p  pLet me sketch the situation and partner requestp  p1 The partner requirement and the question to use a client certificate.p  pPartner X needs to call an API on my backend and they have the clear requirement to use Clientcertificate authentication. They created the clientcertificate and provided us the certificate with only the public key since it seems only logic they keep the private key actually private and in their own systems. The certificate was imported on the local computer account and looking at the certification path this is valid. All intermediate certification authorities and in the end the root certification authority are trusted.p  p2 Our WCF strongserversidestrong configurationp  pI have a serviceBehavior configured as suchp  precodeltbehavior nameClientCertificateBehaviorgt     ltserviceMetadata httpsGetEnabledtrue gt         ltserviceCredentialsgt         ltserviceCertificate findValueltserialnumber heregt x509FindTypeFindBySerialNumber gt         ltclientCertificategt           ltauthentication certificateValidationModePeerTrust gt         ltclientCertificategt     ltserviceCredentialsgt ltbehaviorgt codepre  pemI guess I made a first mistake here and should use ChainTrust to actually validate the certificate using its certification pathem.

We configured the folder in which the services reside to require SSL and to accept Client certificates. Authenticationwise anonymous authentication is enabled.p  hr  pThe thing is that communication from the partner works and we were confident that everything was OK, however toggling the IISsetting to require client certificate shows us that all of a sudden it is no longer possible to successfully call our service.p  pAm I correct to assume that following things are not done correctlyp  ul lipThe serviceCerticate in the serviceBehavior is not really necessary. This is a setting used by the client. Or is it necessary to provide this certificate information for the service endpoint to match the certificate thats being send by the clientpli lipFor clientcertificate authentication to really work in IIS the certificate needs to be mapped to a user. This user should be granted permissions on the folder containing the services and all authentication mechanisms anonymous, windows,... should be disabled. This way IIS will handle the actual handshake and validate the servicecommunication. Or is it more a matter of extra security mapping the certificate to a userp  ul lipBy setting Accept on IIS we bypass the actual certificate validation between client and server.pli lipAll authentication mechanisms like anonymous and windows have to be disabled on IIS for the folder which holds the services.pli ulli ul

I dont want to display non editable fields. If I use ediatable fileds only, after updating, I get non editable fields as null perName is null after update.

I am specifying name attribute of text field using codesession.person[iterator index].perAgecode. Till this point everything works fine. But if I change the value in any text field amp try to update, I get the old session attribute instead of changed one.

As a case study I came to know that Yahoo runs more than 15000 jobs on a daily basis. So if most of jobs are Data Dependent It will be an overhead on NameNode. I am currently working on a cluster which has 34 Nodes, basically our own laptops. But my prof has asked me how can I validate my work on such a large scale. I have to provide him some analysis to prove that my solution will work on that scale. Please suggest me some options for doing the samep

Negative 7397 pI am using a lightbox in which I am having some trouble with jquery codescrolltopcode function.

Negative 7397 pIm working with an API that only supports byte values for the RGB components of a color. I am trying to differentiate a variable amount of items, say between 8 and 12. I would like to assign each item a color. So if there are 10 items, I would divide the range into 10 and assign each item the corresponding color think rainbow.

Negative 7397 pI saw that another poster WolfiG had asked a very similar question, but I dont see the answer.  I understand the error message, and am NOT looking for how to fix the error, I AM trying to determine whether there is any type of error checking or debugging technique to use for other errors.p  pI found similar code and added to it, to get each table in each database on a server...and to show the PKs and rowcounts. Working on an inventory and then a data dictionary  but this is not the issue, I am just explaining how the code came to be.p  pSO in this case I had already narrowed down the data somewhat  meaning I know which database I am querying and encountered the error  so there were only 81 tables rows that could have been in error.   BUT of course that would require too much manual checking to find the problem, so I was hoping that there was a way to see which t.name was being read when the subquery got the error.  I narrowed it down the the first subquery by commenting out a line at a time there were 10 and I just did not copy all of them here.     p  pAgain the question is and it looks like I am not the only person asking this type of question    strongemIs there a way to determine which row data caused an error in a queryemstrong p  pand in the example below,     strongemIs there a way to display the t.name or other columns data was the most recent when an error occuredemstrongp  pHaving worked in Mainframe  you can look at a dump or buffer.

I had to say that I am pretty much sadly disputing your comment that SQL is better than other DBs for the dictionary.

So looking for a pattern, I found that MAYBE sysindexes.status  might limit my results  but while that was close there still were duplicate rows.  Again ARGGGH   p

Negative 7397 pWe are developing a big piece of software that has a main SWF of more than 30mb. In order to reduce the loading time, we are using external SWFs that are loaded on demand e.g. when a certain GUI Button is clicked or at a certain stage of the application is reached. In order to connect the logic of the SWFs with the main application we are loading the external SWF with all its class definitions first and set graphics and localized texts later. The data and logic is set blindly  we as programmers do not see which public member and variables are used by the SWF created by GUI designers so we are really prone to typos on both sides of GUI development and AS3 programming. However  we do have the source code available and the troubles we are having seem to be unnecessary.p  pHow do we connect source code of Adobe Flash Pro with AS3 code which works with the corresponding SWF in a way that code assistance features of Flash Builder are enabled When you import the code of the .fla, certain members are unknown since they only exist within the .fla. What is the recommended workflowp

Negative 7397 pOkay so I have 3 TextViews top, divider, botom that form a stacked fraction like 34 but the 4 is below the 3 with a horizontal line dividing them. p  pThe problem is the horizontal line... because all the dynamic creation of these elements is done in the onCreate method, I cannot use .getWidth and .setWidth to limit the size of the line it is supposed to be as long as the longest textview, either above or below it.p  pNow my question is is it possible to make a container with the three TextViews stacked neatly one above the other, that could be easily added to an existing layout, like a box that would contain the three views and that would function as its own layout in which I could set the line width, the textviews text align to center etcp

Negative 7397 pI need help with some Javascript strtotimetype code, please.p  pOur company runs a weekly promotion for 2 days only for its members. So when a member logs in, they see a banner promoting the promotion. If they happen to login outside of the promotion dates, the banner links to an information page. Otherwise, it links directly to the promotion.p  pCurrently were updating this by hand each week, which is a pain. Wed like to be able to use Javascript to automatically change the link for us. OK, no problem, rightp  pWell, the thing is, what we dont want to have to do is go in and edit the script every week with the specific datestimes  otherwise, whats the point Currently the promotion runs Wednesday at 9a.m. to Thursday at 9a.m. It changes from time to time, every couple of months or so MonTue, 9a9p, that sort of thing so we will have to edit the script from time to time, but if we can avoid doing it weekly, thatd be great.p  pSo heres what I came up with. Its heavily commented so my notsotechnical coworkers can go in and make the edits without too much difficulty.p  precodevar getData  function      var d  new Date     var today  d.getDay  current day, numerically     var hr  d.getHours  current hour       For Days      0  Sunday      1  Monday      2  Tuesday      3  Wednesday      4  Thursday      5  Friday      6  Saturday      var startDay  3     var endDay  4       For Hours      This is a 24hour clock. Midnight 1200 AM is 0, Noon  12, 9 PM  21, etc.      So for a start time of 9 AM, put 9, and for an end time of 9 PM, put 21.      var startTime  12     var endTime  15       Set the url variable to the NONsale landing page.

If this were the real thing, the desired result would be for the promo link to display Wednesday 12pm to Thursday 3pm. What happens with this code, obviously, is that the promo banner is live Wednesday 123 and then Thursday 123.p  pIve goofed around with various permutations of the logic and havent been able to hit the right one. Ultimately, Id like to be able to open the script or for one of my coworkers to open it, and be able to set the start daytime and end daytime, without having to set specific dates Wednesday, July 24 to Thursday, July 25 and it just work.p  pIf this were PHP Id have it wrapped up. But its Javascript, so any assistance I can get making this work would be fantastic.p  pThanks, Bobp  pstrongUPDATEstrong Kamala, I tweaked the time a bit by adding minutes, and a few other tweaks, but theres an issue of it not accepting the end time.

Negative 7397 pI am working on a form that has two pages, technically 1 page, just hiding the second until first is finished. My first task was to be able to validate the first page with parsley.js, without including the elements from the second page. I did this by disabling via attr the elements on the second page. Therefore only leaving the items on the first to be validated when the Next button is clicked.  This works great, unfortunately on the second page, after I removeAttrdisabled from the elements, parsley ignores them and still only validates the first page, thus returning true and submitting the page  without checking any elements from the second.p  pThanks for readingp

List1. string, bool  List2, string, bool, object List2, is the one failing.p  p3 The other Listbox works like a charm.p  p4 I could provide alot of code, but there is a lot to take in, since i dont know where the problem occurs, so ill provide a snippet.p  precode    ltDataTemplate xKeyListBoxItemTemplateAssignmentTypesgt             ltGridgt                 ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt                     ltRowDefinition HeightAutogt                     ltRowDefinition HeightAutogt                 ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt                 ltGrid.ColumnDefinitionsgt                     ltColumnDefinition Width gt                     ltColumnDefinition Width gt                 ltGrid.ColumnDefinitionsgt             ltStackPanel NameStackPanelAssignmentType Grid.Column0 Grid.Row0                 Margin0 0 0 0 gt                 ltFormImageCheckBox xNameImageCheckBoxState HorizontalAlignmentRight                                          SourceSimaTech.Forms.AssignmentBringBackcomponentImagesCheckbox.png                                          Width24 Height24 MouseLeftButtonUpImageCheckBoxStateMouseLeftButtonUp gt             ltStackPanelgt             ltStackPanel Grid.Row0 Grid.Column1 OrientationHorizontal Margin10 0 0 0gt                 ltTextBlock NameTextBlockType TextBinding PathType StyleStaticResource TextBlockStyle1 gt                 ltStackPanelgt             ltGridgt     ltDataTemplategt     ltDataTemplate xKeyListBoxItemTemplateVehiclegt         ltGridgt             ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt                 ltRowDefinition HeightAutogt                 ltRowDefinition HeightAutogt             ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt             ltGrid.ColumnDefinitionsgt                 ltColumnDefinition Width gt                 ltColumnDefinition Width gt             ltGrid.ColumnDefinitionsgt             ltStackPanel NameStackPanelVehicle Grid.Column0 Grid.Row0 Margin0 0 0 0 gt                 ltFormImageCheckBox xNameImageCheckBoxState HorizontalAlignmentRight                                          SourceSimaTech.Forms.AssignmentBringBackcomponentImagesCheckbox.png                                          Width24 Height24 MouseLeftButtonUpImageCheckBoxStateMouseLeftButtonUp  gt             ltStackPanelgt             ltStackPanel Grid.Row0 Grid.Column1 OrientationHorizontal Margin10 0 0 0gt                 ltTextBlock NameTextBlockName TextBinding PathVehicle.Name StyleStaticResource TextBlockStyle1 gt             ltStackPanelgt         ltGridgt     ltDataTemplategt        ltBorder Grid.Column0 Grid.Row2 Margin20 10 Padding20 0 BorderThickness2 0 0 0 StyleStaticResource BorderHorizontalSeperatorgt             ltStackPanelgt                 ltStackPanel OrientationHorizontalgt                     ltStackPanel Margin0 5gt                         ltTextBlock TextGammel dato StyleStaticResource TextBlockStyle1 gt                         ltDatePicker NameDatePickerOldDate CalendarStyleStaticResource StyleCalendar HorizontalAlignmentLeft Margin0 10 0 0 Width150 BackgroundWhite SnapsToDevicePixelsTrue gt                         ltDatePickergt                     ltStackPanelgt                     ltStackPanel Margin18 5gt                         ltTextBlock TextNy dato StyleStaticResource TextBlockStyle1 gt                         ltDatePicker NameDatePickerNewDate CalendarStyleStaticResource StyleCalendar HorizontalAlignmentLeft Margin0 10 0 0 Width150 BackgroundWhite SnapsToDevicePixelsTruegt                     ltStackPanelgt                 ltStackPanelgt                 ltStackPanel Margin0 5gt                     ltTextBlock TextOpgave type StyleStaticResource TextBlockStyle1 Margin0 5 gt                     ltListBox NameListBoxAssignmentTypes  Margin0 0 100 0 ItemTemplateStaticResource ListBoxItemTemplateAssignmentTypes gt                      ltListBoxgt                 ltStackPanelgt             ltStackPanelgt         ltBordergt         ltBorder Grid.Column1 Grid.Row2 BorderThickness0 0 2 0 Margin10 10 20 10 StyleStaticResource BorderHorizontalSeperatorgt             ltStackPanelgt                 ltStackPanelgt                     ltTextBlock TextMontrMontrgruppe StyleStaticResource TextBlockStyle1 Margin0 5 0 10 gt                     ltListBox NameListBoxVehicles Margin0 0 120 0 ItemTemplateStaticResource ListBoxItemTemplateVehicle gt                      ltListBoxgt                 ltStackPanelgt                 ltStackPanel NameStackPanelButtons OrientationHorizontal HorizontalAlignmentLeft Margin0 30 0 0gt                 ltStackPanelgt             ltStackPanelgt         ltBordergt codepre  pI have code behind aswell,  to set and remove my checkmark in the image, but this is only triggerede on a mouseupevent, and has nothing to do with scrolling.p  pIts a strange problem, and I wondered if anyone had an idea, or had experienced it themselves.p  pEDIT Found out that when a listbox has a certain number of listitems, it redraws the listitem back to default.

Negative 7397 pI am writing a program that does the followingp  ol liWhen the user right clicks on a file and selects an option OPT, an exe file is called with the inputs as the constant OPT and the file path.li liIn the registry, for the key HKEYCLASSESROOTshelloption xcommand the data is someprog.exe OPT 1  where 1 is the file path of the file selected via right click.li liThe exe file then writes the path and the string OPT to a file f.li liA background process polls this file and picks up the entries in the file f .li ol  pNow I would like to extend the above solution to multiple files by enabling multiple selecteg 300 files. However with the above setup when we select n files, it spawns n processes which write to the shared files making the entire  setup extremely inefficient. I am looking for a solution that spawns just one process whose command line arguments are the string OPT and the n file paths. I tried googling but I could not find a solution.p  pI found that Notepad does something similar where if you select multiple files and then click on open, it opens one notepad program but has multiple tabs inside it. Though I am not looking for exactly the same solution the end goal seems to be the same ie.

Negative 7397 pI was experimenting with AVX AVX2 instruction sets to see the performance of streaming on consecutive arrays.

What is  also interesting is that prefetching does not seem to be helping and L1 misses increases considerably. Although, I would expect to see at least 50 percent hit rate considering each cache line brought into L1 for read will be a hit  for the second access 64 byte cache line 32 byte is read with each iteration. However, once dataset is spilled over to L2 it seems L1 hit rate drops to 2. Considering arrays are not really overlapping with L1 cache size this should not be because of cache conflicts. So this part still does not make sense to me.p

Negative 7397 pI know this question has been asked a million times but every answer I find is either incomplete or links to the AES256EncryptWithKey category which has been removed due to insecurity.p  pBasically, I have a PHP script that sends JSON data to my iPhone app. In this JSON data, I would like to encrypt a few of the strings that will be decrypted in the app. These are not super sensitive strings or anything, just price lists that we dont want competitors to scrape for their own programs.p  pMy encryption knowledge is minimal at best. I know PHP has some key padding issues so I dont mind if I have to use Python or Perl to do the encryption. I just want the encrypted string to be base64encoded, sent to the app, and then decoded to be displayed inapp. I figure I will just use a hardcoded key on both the server and app to encrypt  decrypt.p  pAre there any easy classes, code snippets, functions, whatever to do just that Any links to other answers that are secure enough for this type of encryptionp  pSorry if this was answered before, I have been searching for a day and havent found what I am looking for.p

Im trying to work with a field in a gridview that I need to take a long file name that Im entering for the first time and chop all but the six characters on the left side of the file name during the update process.  The rest of the fields in the gridview have already been entered so this isnt an INSERT scenario but an UPDATE operation.  Ive figured out the basic command for that LEFT but what I need to do is to have the code behind the page Im assuming with SQL code take a filename in this formatp  pHeres the code  p  precodeltaspGridView IDGridView1 runatserver AutoGenerateColumnsFalse DataSourceIDSqlDataSource1gt ltColumnsgt ltaspCommandField ShowEditButtonTrue gt ltaspBoundField DataFieldline HeaderTextLine SortExpressionline InsertVisibleFalse gt ltaspBoundField DataFielddata HeaderTextData SortExpressiondata gt ltaspBoundField DataFieldnewdata HeaderTextNew Data SortExpressionnewdata gt ltaspCommandField ShowEditButtonTrue gt ltColumnsgt ltaspGridViewgt codepre  pThe output code looks something like this...p  pLine nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp    Data   nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspNew Databr .............................................................................................................................br  1 nbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp  131024000000Ablahdeblah1of12.pdf    nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp 131024br  2 nbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp  131024000000Ablahdeblah1of12.rtfbr  3 nbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp  131024000000Ablahdeblah2of12.pdfbr  4 nbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp  131024000000Ablahdeblah2of12.rtfbr  5 nbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp  131025000000Ablahdeblah3of12.pdf             p  pand so on....p  pWhat Im attempting to do with this is to find a way via SQL to take the file name behind the scenes in the data column, cut off the file name to the right of the first six digits and then write it to the newdata column.  p  pHeres what Ive triedp  precodeUPDATE  [dbo].[lefttest]  SET [newdata]   SELECT LEFTData,6  FROM [dbo].[lefttest] WHERE [data]  data GO codepre  pWhich yields the following errorp  precodeMsg 512, Level 16, State 1, Line 2 Subquery returned more than 1 value.

Negative 7397 pIve written a fairly complex program which simulates the behavior of small celllike organisms in a particle system.p  pThe simulation goes through a few stages where it calculates the next position for each object in the simulation. A motion member function is called for each particle and organism in the simulation, which updates its displacement vectors in the case of the organism, it handles AI and motion. The render function then iterates through each object and draws the appropriate shape at each objects new displacement.p  pThe displacement calculations for each object are done several hundred times before a frame is rendered, which allows the simulation to run much faster.p  pIn this process, it is impossible to calculate the next position of the objects without knowing the current position due to the serial nature of the process, so I cannot give a block of frames to calculate to several different threads  each frame relies on the calculation of the previous one.p  pAs I mentioned before, the new positions of each object are calculated by iterating through each object and calling a current objects member function which calculates the new position for that particular object. I was wondering whether this process could be done in parallel  calculate one quarter of the objects on one thread, another quarter on a second thread, etc. Is this method possible, and would it improve the speed of the calculations for each frame when there are huge amounts of objects in the simulationp

Negative 7397 pI am trying to add the elements of a vector of doubles belonging to a class called path into a double called dist using a for loop twice. I want it to add all the distances inside the class vector for the first iteration and then at the end set the double dist back to zero and add them up again. However, when I run it, it works fine the first time as it prints out the correct answer of 3, but the double ends up being 0 by the time it prints out the second time and after the loop is done. It looks like it is not adding the vectors data.

Negative 7397 pI just took a final exam and one of the questions asked me to double join three tables, and report the max sale payout for each salesperson.  The tables have the following variablesp  pSalespersonid, name Orderorderid, orderdate, Custid, Salepersonid, amount Customerid, namep  pAfter joiningp  precodeselect salesperson.Name, Orders.Number, customer.Name, Orders.Amount from Orders join salesperson on orders.Salespersonid  salesperson.ID join Customer on customer.ID  orders.custid codepre  pWhat the instructed wanted was for me to find each salespersons maximum sell as found by order.amount. He also wanted the salesperson salesperson.name, the order number of the max sale orders.number, the customer the sale was with customer.name, and the max sale amount. What is the most efficient way to do this problem I have tried to use group by salesperson.name, but I cannot because the orders.number and customer.name are never held in the aggregation.p  pI finished the problem this way p  precodeselect  salesperson.name as SalesPerson,  orders.number as OrderNumber,  customer.Name as CustomerName,  orders.Amount as SaleAmount from salesperson left join Orders on salesperson.ID  orders.Salespersonid left join Customer on orders.custid  customer.ID where orders.Amount in select maxorders.Amount   from salesperson   join Orders   on salesperson.ID  orders.Salespersonid   join Customer   on orders.custid  customer.ID   group by salesperson.name codepre  pI know this is a bad way to do it. For instance, what if two different salespersons max sale was equivalent Max and min are not like count and sum because it is picking out one line from a aggregation, but the rules still apply. Also, you might notices that there is no real unique identifier in the joined table other than order.number which is not useful. Therefore, I would have to use some composite of salesperson.name and order.number.p  pAlso, what do I do if I have to pick the top three sales for each salesperson Should such an output be totally different codewise than what would be required from just the first salep  pI keep bumping me head against this problem, and I would love to have a more professional approach to this problem. p

Negative 7397 pIm trying to convert from a different DVCS to Mercurial. Ive found a situation where Mercurial wont let me do something that the other DVCS finds perfectly reasonable.p  pIt seems that in the repo, one of the users is in the habit of working like thisp  ul liforkli lido work in forkli limerge trunk  forkli litestli limerge fork  trunkli ul  pThat all seems perfectly reasonable. Except that if trunk emhasnt advancedem while the user was testing, hg refuses to do the final merge, with abort nothing to merge. codeforcecode doesnt help.p  pI can replicate this with the following test casep  precodeecho Test data gt file hg add file hg commit file m Ancestor  rev 0  echo Trunk gt file hg commit file m Trunk  rev 1  hg checkout 0 echo Branch gt file hg commit file m Branch  rev 2  hg merge tool internallocal 1 hg commit m Merge trunk to branch  rev 3  hg checkout 1 hg merge tool internallocal 3   lt fails hg commit m Merge branch to trunk codepre  pIf I modify the test so that trunk advances between the two merges, so at the final merge trunk is now a new revision 4 and revision 3 is merged into it, everything works fine.p  pThis is obviously all perfectly standard workflow  I do this myself. So why isnt this workingp  pbUpdatebp  pThis test case worksp  precodeecho Test data gt file hg add file hg commit file m Ancestor hg branch trunk  rev 0  echo Trunk gt file hg commit file m Trunk  rev 1  hg checkout 0 hg branch branch echo Branch gt file  hg commit file m Branch  rev 2  hg merge tool internallocal 1 hg commit m Merge trunk to branch  rev 3  hg checkout 1 hg merge tool internallocal 3 hg commit m Merge branch to trunk codepre  pThis is iexactly the same codei as the first test case, except that trunk and fork are now explicitly branched rather than just using adhoc heads. All merges and checkouts use the same revisions as before. Apparently branches are magic.p  pUnfortunately I cant use branches in the real code, because the other DVCS iisi using adhoc heads, none of which have any branch information. I dont want to have to fake a branch for every fork.p  pHow can I persuade Mercurial to let me do this without using explicit branchesp
Negative 7397 pI have plans for a small application, to gather some data from a website. The website have a few textboxes, in which you can write different numerical values, then click a button and an output value will be written on the page.

Negative 7397 pIm building an application that accepts input over a websocket that has to be shared back to other clients that may be connected to other frontend servers.p  pFor simplicity imagine a multiuser multiroom chat application. Getting the input routed to the correct connection isnt a problem its the messaging between the servers and being able to scale that and keep the latency of the messages in check.p  pRight now I have a broker process that each frontend connects to, they then subscribe to a queue for anything its connections might need to know about. This is being done to cut out receiving messages from the broker that will never be used by a frontend. However, I still get about 75 to 85 of the messages being sent back to each frontend from the broker. p  pOn the trip in Im doing message validation, parsing and any other business logic work. On the trip out Im looping over the local array for the subscription and sending the message to each subscribed connection.p  pAn example If Im getting 10 messages in across 11 frontend servers thats something around 110 total messages  10 messages handled locally and not sent back by the broker  0.75 optimistic subscription level  75 messages being sent back to each server to handle. So we have 10 local  75 broker  85 messages being processed for that slice of time by each server.p  pNow I wouldnt have 11 frontend servers for 100 msgsec maybe two but the messages being sent back to each frontend server by the broker process would appear to explode the more messages I receive across additional frontend servers.p  pThe broker process is a small node.js application that talks to RabbitMQ and PostgreSQL. The frontend servers are also node.js applications.p  pWhat can I do or should I be doing differently to keep latency low during periods of high volumep  pUpdate to reply user comment While I expect a lot of overlap between the queues the connections will cause their frontend server to subscribe to I dont expect it to be 100 for each server. Worst case is every frontend server has to subscribe to every queue on the broker thus getting 100 of the messages back from the broker. Optimistically, only about 75 of the messages will really need to be sent back to any specific frontend server.p  pSecond Update for itaifrenkel It is possible that a message sent by two users might be returned in different orders. It would only be acceptable if the latency was very low and it only happens with messages send very close to each other. If it was happening with messages seconds apart then Id say we have an issue with latency and scale.p  pThere is a case where we would need to display a history but I left that out because I felt it was out of the scope of the question.p

Negative 7397 pI have a few different ways of upload entire directories to Amazon S3 within my application depending on what options are selected.  Currently one of the options will perform an upload of multiple directories in parallel.  Im not sure if this is a good idea as in some cases it sped up the upload and other cases it slowed it down.  The speed up appears to be when there are a bunch of small directories, but it slows down if there are large directories in the batch.  Im using the parallel ForEach loop seen below and utilizing the AWS APIs codeTransferUtility.UploadDirectoryAsynccode method as suchp  precodeParallel.ForEachdirs,myParallelOptions,                     async dir gt  await MyUploadMethodAsyncdir  codepre  pWhere the codeTransferUtility.UploadDirectoryAsynccode method is within codeMyUploadMethodAsynccode.  The codeTransferUtilitycodes upload methods all perform parallel uploads of parts a single file if the size is big enough to do so, so performing a parallel upload of the directory as well may be overkill.  Obviously we are still limited to the amount of bandwidth available so this might be a waste and I just should just use a regular foreach loop with the codeUploadDirectoryAsynccode method.  Can anyone provide some insight on if this is bad case for parallelizationp

Negative 7397 pI would like to write a custom fullscreen container view controller with the intention of putting a UINavigationController in it as a child view controller. The view of the UINavigationController will fill up the view of the container view controller so that it looks like the UINavigationController is the root view controller. One would want to do something like this to, say, create the sliding sidebar menu UI popularized by Facebook.p  pWhat Ive done works EXCEPT there is a glitch when presenting another view controller that hides the status bar when the iPhone is in landscape orientation. Typically, the navigation bar slides up when the status bar disappears and slides down when it reappears. Instead, the navigation bar stays where it is when it is suppose to slide up, and when it is suppose to slide down, it is first positioned with the status bar overlapping it and then jumps to its correct position below the status bar. Basically, Im trying to have the UINavigationController behave as it would if it were not inside a custom container view controller.p  pBelow is some code that you can run to see the problem, but if you dont want to do that, just take a look at the emContainerViewControllerem class, which implements a minimal custom container view controller. strongWhat is it that Im missing in my custom container view controller that is causing this problemstrong It works when I use a UITabBarController as the container view controller, so it seems like Im just missing something in my implementation.p  h1MORE STUFF BELOW TO READ IF YOU WANTh1  pIf you would like to run the sample code to see the problem, here is an overview.

Negative 7397 pIm learning RoR on the side and Ive decided to duplicate my current site built w PHPWP to the exact functionality or as best as I can.p  pI have a Projects model and each has their own show page. I also have a Pages controller which routes all URLs to root as a slug. ie testpage, about, contactp  pBut is there a way I can also point the projects slug to root So it would be projectname1, projectname2 etc instead of projectsslugp  pIm new to Ruby and RoR so I feel like Im probably missing something obvious. The only way I can see how to do this, for now, is to write a controller to pull in the proper controller for the slug type based on a slugmatching system. So if page matches in a Page model, it uses that template. Otherwise, a project.p  pIt seems wrong and Im not even sure if I can direct controllers like that anywayp  hr  pCame up w this.. but it seems incompletep  precodeinclude Rails.application.routes.urlhelpers  class SiteController lt ApplicationController     attraccessor project, page      def show         check  gt m  m.wheretitle gt params[slug].first           if project  check.callProjects.present             render projectsshow          elsif page  check.callPages.present             render pagesshow          else             raise ActionControllerRoutingError.new Not Found         end     end end codepre

Negative 7397 pI have a swing Desktop application that uses Hibernate.

Negative 7397 pI need to make an application where a mobile web app can connect to a local web service in a LAN.  For example, several locations are running this web service on their own local server. When someone with the mobile app comes into the location they can open it up and it will somehow be able to connect to that local webservice through WiFi.  The mobile app wont know the IP of that webservice ahead of time.  Any thought on how to go about this  This will be a .NET webservice and HTML5 app but I dont think that matters.p

Negative 7397 pI have recently written an asynchronous HTTP client in c for iOSOSX. I was confused as to why headers were not arriving in my CFHTTPMessageRef response object until I realised that there was an object lurking as a property of the stream which contains the headers after handling the kCFStreamEventBytesAvailable event.p  pSo now I copy the headers from the property into my response object during the notification of the stream ending, before calling my event handler.p  pcode available on request, theres quite a lot of itp  pThe Apple documentation is characteristically silent on the subject and I was wondering if anyone out there knows the reason for this design decision by apple. I am keen to know in case I have a fundamental misunderstanding somewherep  pEDIT the documentation says thisp  blockquote   pAfter you schedule the request on a run loop, you will eventually get   a header complete callback. At this point, you can call   CFReadStreamCopyProperty to get the message response from the read   streamp blockquote  pHowever there seems to be no indication as to what the name or value of this event mask is.p  pEDIT Having done some experimenting, I see that the stream creates its own response object some time after sending the codekCFStreamEventOpenCompletedcode notification and before the first codekCFStreamEventHasBytesAvailablecode notification.p  pIn the codekCFStreamEventHasBytesAvailablecode event handler I can do thisp  precodeauto response  CFHTTPMessageRefCFReadStreamCopyPropertyreadStream,                                           kCFStreamPropertyHTTPResponseHeader constexpr CFIndex bufferSize  1024 UInt8 buffer[bufferSize] auto bytesRead  CFReadStreamReadreadStream, buffer, bufferSize if bytesRead gt 0      CFHTTPMessageAppendBytesresponse, buffer, bytesRead  CFReleaseresponse codepre  pand the streams response message object is indeed updated with new body data.

Negative 7397 pI need to write a customized function that will be called many times by other fixed functions. In this function, at the first called time, it will return the total number of lines of a file.

Negative 7397 pI am trying to animate a refresh button so that it rotates indicating that the refresh is in progress. It needs to be smooth so that if the refresh only takes  0.1 seconds we still do a complete rotation so the user can acknowledge something happened and that its a smooth transition. It should also continue rotating until i stop it however stopping shouldnt abruptly stop it only tell it to complete the current turn.p  pOriginally i did something like thisp  precodeCABasicAnimation rotationAnimation rotationAnimation  [CABasicAnimation animationWithKeyPathtransform.rotation.z] rotationAnimation.toValue  [NSNumber numberWithFloatMPI  2.0  10] rotationAnimation.cumulative  YES rotationAnimation.duration  10 [self.layer addAnimationrotationAnimation forKeyrotationAnimation] codepre  pAnd stopping like sop  precode[self.layer removeAllAnimations] codepre  pThis Worked fine in the sense that the animation continued past 2pi radians smoothly, however when the refresh took less than 110 of the second it wouldnt look very smooth as the animation would get get 10 of the way round and then suddenly stop and the removeAllAnimations method resets the image back to its default.p  pI managed to get around this an alternative stop methodp  precode    CALayer presentLayer  self.layer.presentationLayer     float currentAngle  [NSNumber  [presentLayer valueForKeyPathtransform.rotation.z] floatValue]      [self.layer removeAllAnimations]         if currentAngle lt 0          currentAngle  2  ABScurrentAngle           float rotationProgressPercent  currentAngle  2  MPI         CABasicAnimation rotationAnimation     rotationAnimation  [CABasicAnimation animationWithKeyPathtransform.rotation.z]     rotationAnimation.fromValue  [NSNumber numberWithFloatcurrentAngle]     rotationAnimation.toValue  [NSNumber numberWithFloatMPI  2]     rotationAnimation.cumulative  YES     rotationAnimation.duration  1  rotationProgressPercent codepre  pBasically I get the current angle of the rotation in radians, stop the animation and start a new animation from that position to two pi. I have to do some work with the duration to keep the speed constant, the speed aspect works fine but the problem is that somethings the animation has a very slight lagtwitch to it. I believe this is because the stop animation is asynchronously posting this request to the system this is just speculation and that my current angle is stale by the time i go to do my second animation.p  pAre there any other approaches i can try.p

Negative 7397 pI am implementing a Python plugin that is part of a larger C program. The goal of this program is to allow the user to input a commands actions in Python. It currently receives a string from the C function and runs it via the exec function. The user can then use an API to affect changes on the larger C program.p  pThe current feature I am working on is a pause execution feature. It needs to remember where it is in the code execution as well as the state of any local variables, and resume execution once a condition has been met. I am not very familiar with Python, and I would like some advice how to implement this feature. My first design ideasp  p1 Using the yield command. This seemed to be a good idea at the start since when you use the next command it remembers everything I needed it to, but the problem is that yield only returns to the previous level in the call stack as far as I can tell. So if the user calls a function that yields it will simply return to the users code, and not the larger C program. As far as I can tell there isnt a way to propagate the yield command up the stackp  p2 Threading Create a main python thread that creates a thread for each command. This main thread would spawn a thread for each command executed and kill it when it is done. If it needs to be suspended and restarted it could do so through a queue of locks.p  pThose were the only two options I came up with. I am not sure the yield function would work or is what it was designed to do. I think the Threading approach would work but might be overkill, and take a long time to develop. I also was looking for some sort of Task Module in Python, but couldnt find exactly what I was looking for. I was wondering if anyone has any other suggestions as I am not very familiar with Python.p  pEDIT As mentioned in the comments I did not explain what needs to happen when the script Pauses. The python plugin needs to allow the C program to continue execution. In my mind this means A returning if we are talking about a single threaded approach, or B Sending a messageFunction call to Cp  pEDIT EDIT As stated I didnt fully explain the problem description. I will make another post that has a better statement of what currently exists, and what needs to happen as well as providing some sudo code.

So the positions are relative. Also I can save the object for later but that will consume some more memory, likep  precodemActiveCard.equals getChildAtLASTOBJECTINSTACK  codepre  pOne idea is to setId of the view or setTag. So if I have a unique Stringint then I could later get the id or the tag.

Since Asnyc request initiated by file system in mobile device, I cant add a cookie in JavaScript code. Simply because cross domain policy in web browsers not allowing writing cookies to other domains.  p  pSo to overcome this issue I have added few lines of code to viewControllerForRequest method in CDVViewController class IOS platform plugin. p  pObjectiveC Code as follows and simply it works.

Negative 7397 pIm really confused over here. I am a ai programmer working on a game that is designed to detect beats in songs and some more. I have no previous knowledge about audio and just reading through whatever material i can find. While i got fft working and stuff I simply dont understand the way samples are transferred to different frequencies. Question 1, what does each frequency stands for. For the algorithm i got. I can transfer for example 1024 samples into 512 outcomes. So are they a description of the strength of each spectrum at the current second it doesnt really make sense since what i remember is that there are 20,000hz in a 44.1khz audio recording. So how does 512 spectrum samples explain what is happening in that moment Question 2, from what i read, its a number that represent the sound wave at this moment. However i read that by squaring both left channel and right channel, and add them together and you will get the current power level. Both these seems incoherent to my understanding, and i am really buff led so please explain away. p

Negative 7397 pI have 3 sets of data AA,B1 and C1 with different lenght and size. The purpose of my code is to be able to count for the similarity score between the data for example the similarity score between AA and B1, AA and C1, B1 and C1. So below is my code that should be able to calculate the similarity score but there is a bit of problem in looping. Only the highest value is select for each pair of data of different length.

Negative 7397 pI have a code that accesses a TFS, retrieves a query, modifies it it sets the changed date to  last time I executed it and then I would like to display the results of the query in Visual Studio  as if I would have double clicked on one of my predefined queries in Team Explorer.p  pRemarks I dont want to write my own UI to display the results. However I cannot go with predefined queries or modify a predefined query because VS does not support queries with time precision like code[System.ChangedDate] gt 20150402T114500.0000000code. But it is possible to specify and execute such a query in code with codenew Queryworkitemstore, query, null, falsecode where the last parameter indicates that I need time precision and not date precision.p

Negative 7397 pFor VBA functions and most programming in general i understand general program execution to occur something like this...p  pInside a sub procedure if you call a function it should return a value, in this case it would return a value to variable num.p  pTo expand this means that execution reaches the line where I call the function, and should then skip down to where the function is written, and go through executing each line inside that function.p  pThis is how it has worked for me previously when I use the F8 key to highlight and follow the code execution line by line. p  pstrongThe problemstrong The problem is when execution reaches the line inside the sub procedure where the function is called the function is just skipped over and execution doesnt go inside the function and run each line inside it.p  pand I should say when this happened I had 95 of a working program, and ive tried rewriting the function, calling other functions.p  pBut whenever a function is called execution of the code doesnt go into the function itself it just skips over it, and the variable that holds the result of the function therefore is left empty.p  pIve tried creating breakpoints at the beginning of the function and when the function is called in the sub procedure however this hasnt worked.p  pAt the very least execution should get to the definition of the function Function FirstRow etc and throw and error but its not doing that.p  precodeSub Main      Dim num as double      Dim sheetname as string      num  FirstRowsheetname  End Sub  Function FirstRowsheet as string as double      select case sheet ltlt execution never gets inside the function      case sheet         FirstRow  8     case sheet2         FirstRow  12      end select  End Function codepre

This is the only code that has worked for child tabs, all other tab selection code only worked for the parent tabs only.p  precode Pickup the onClick and get the ID of the tab or sub tab being clicked, this is used in the case switch statement for updating the grid accordingly     var tabContainerPanel  registry.byIdmyDivID   get dijit from its source dom element      ontabContainerPanel, Click, function event          selectedTabString  tabContainerPanel.selectedChildWidget.title          if typeof tabContainerPanel.selectedChildWidget.selectedChildWidget  undefined              There are no child tabs, parent tab only             selectedTabString  tabContainerPanel.selectedChildWidget.selectedChildWidget.title                   Update tab you selected when you select it setGridData will update it every 10 seconds after it is selected.         switch selectedTabString              case blah1                 Some code blah blah                 break             case blah2                 Some code blah blah                 break And so on...another 13 cases... codepre  pMy problem is when I click inside my codedojocode codegridxcode object which resides within a codeContentPanecode that resides inside my codeTabContainercode, the codeonClickcode is being captured and causing other code to be executed specified only for tab onClicks and it is preventing my mouse clicks from working correctly for the codedojocode components in the cells of the codegridxcode like for buttons and editable text areas etc.p  pHow do I get the tab codeonClickcode code to only work on the tabs themselves and not the child objectsp  pHere is how I am adding the codegridxcode to the codeTabContainercodep  precode     Every tab is a TabContaner, including sub tabs.

Negative 7397 pIm currently in the process of programming a Calculator. I have a JFrame, with a JPanel that has all the various elements on it JButtons, TextArea. However, when the program first starts running, none of the buttons are visible, until the mouse hovers over it Menu Bar and Text Area are visible. Additionally, whenever any of the elements become covered, either by a menu being dropped over it or dragging it with the mouse offscreen then back on, that part of the element now becomes just gray.p  pI was reading around, and was able to find some people mentioning this problem, using repaint to fix it, but that didnt seem to work for me.p  pHeres the code I have so farp

Negative 7397 pIm working on a Magento extension, which should ideally support versions as low as 1.51.6.p  pIve created a custom attribute programatically as a part of the module and its a select type so it naturally renders a drop down.p  pI wonder, is there anyway to override that behaviour and make it render my own control which I have designed with help of jQuery its a drop down with fuzzy search functionality. Or maybe there is a way to make the default Magento drop down into a fuzzy search.p  pI need it to be a fuzzy search because the list of values which can be selected are huge and a fuzzy search makes the selections much faster.p  pThanksp

Negative 7397 pI have created an MVC application in visual studio 2013 using Visual Basic and when the user logs into the application it will either display the log In failed view or continue to the submit Issue view.

This is the exact format it requiresbr Example code20150625T180000codep  pPerhaps Im not interpolating the T character correctly here, but Ive tried lots of combinations and cant get it to work.p

Negative 7397 pim having a problem with webrequest. Im trying to parse a great amount of HTML documents, and sometimes i receive only the  part. The problem persist until i close the application and open it again. So i guess its a defense mechanism against too many requests in the server side.p  pI tried to create a new WebRequest object every time i parse a HTML document, but the problem persists, and only sometimes it stop happen after a variable amount of seconds.p  pI think this could happen because the connection remains open until the garbage collector completely destroy the object. Theres some way to immediately restart the connection Thank you.p

Also, year 2000 X2000 in the table is a factor with 786 levels and it should have been read as an int. Why did R read the observable sex with this large number of levels and why did it read year 2000 as a factor while it read the others as int as is the casep  pEdit The age column has values of the form 2024, 2530, ... till 8590. and another category as 90p

Negative 7397 pFor many years I experience a puzzling problem with rclock. I use rclock on many different Slackware boxes which all feature the same slack version. rclock helps to keep ssh connections open.

Negative 7397 pI have a site where the permalinks are already setup and working fine in the format a hrefhttpdomainpostname relnofollowhttpdomainpostnamea, I want to move them to a hrefhttpdomainblogpostname relnofollowhttpdomainblogpostnamea. Everything is done in the IIS rewrite module. I am assuming I need to first make a redirect rule from a hrefhttpdomainpostname relnofollowhttpdomainpostnamea to a hrefhttpdomainblogpostname relnofollowhttpdomainblogpostnamea and then tweak the permalink rewrite rule to make it work with the new a hrefhttpdomainblogpostname relnofollowhttpdomainblogpostnamea format although I am not sure if that is needed if I update the permalink settings in wordpress to a custom format that has the blog in the path. The first problem I am having is that the redirect is not working correctly, it redirects but doesnt put the blog in front of the postname like I am expecting. Here are the rules in the web.configp  precode        ltrule namewordpress stopProcessingtruegt             ltmatch urlblog negatetrue gt                 ltconditionsgt                     ltadd inputREQUESTFILENAME matchTypeIsFile negatetruegt                     ltadd inputREQUESTFILENAME matchTypeIsDirectory negatetruegt                 ltconditionsgt             ltaction typeRedirect urlblogR1 redirectTypePermanent gt         ltrulegt         ltrule namewordpress2 patternSyntaxWildcardgt             ltmatch urlgt                 ltconditionsgt                     ltadd inputREQUESTFILENAME matchTypeIsFile negatetruegt                     ltadd inputREQUESTFILENAME matchTypeIsDirectory negatetruegt                 ltconditionsgt             ltaction typeRewrite urlindex.phpgt         ltrulegt codepre  pAlso, if I need to tweak the second rule I am not sure what needs to change to make it continue to work or if I just need to update the permalink settings in wordpress. I am fairly new to wordpress and my knowledge of the rewrite module is enough to be dangerous. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I have been looking for an example of this, but have had a difficult time finding one. Thanks in advance.p

Youre forced to to do it that way as Resteasy wont throw codeConstraintViolationExceptionscode directly for some obscure backward compatibility reasons.p  pTherefore in any codeValidationExceptionMappercode implementation one has to conduct some more or less intense inspection on the incoming codeValidationExceptioncode including checks on its type to make sure its an instance of codeResteasyViolationExceptioncode.p  pAnd then theres a line I dont understandp  precode ... if exception instanceof ResteasyViolationException              ResteasyViolationException resteasyViolationException  ResteasyViolationException.class.castexception             Exception e  resteasyViolationException.getException             if e  null                  return buildResponseunwrapExceptione, MediaType.TEXTPLAIN, Status.INTERNALSERVERERROR              else if  ... codepre  pfull code on a hrefhttpsgithub.comsamaxesjaxrsbeanvalidationjavaee7blobmasterwildflysrcmainjavacomsamaxesjavaxrsvalidationValidationExceptionMapper.java relnofollow titlegithubquotGithubap  pNow, under which circumstances would codee.getExceptioncode return something other than codenullcode For what reason does this method exist It is not required by the Bean Validation API, Resteasy javadoc does not explain a single thing at all and as you can see the code above isnt commented as well. So, what could someone possibly attach to a codeResteasyViolationExceptioncode and why should it directly be mapped to internal server errorp  pAs always, thanks a lot in advancep
