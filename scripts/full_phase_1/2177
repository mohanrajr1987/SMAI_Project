Positive 2177 pIm uploading a datababase to MySQL and get this problem p  blockquote   pERROR 1293 HY000 at line 31 Incorrect table definition there can be only one TIMESTAMP column with CURRENTTIMESTAMP in DEFAULT or ON UPDATE clausep blockquote  pThe problem is that of two columns with Timestamp data type in that table, only one should have Current Timestamp value, while the other default value is null. When I upload the database, both columns value get changed to Current Timestamp, which makes the process of exporting and importing very annoying, since I have to manually change it back to null before importing again.p  pAny idea why it automatically changes to current timestamp This is an Amazon EC2 linux instance see attached mysql versionp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comXModw.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comXModw.png altmysql versionap

Where user can create event from any place and this created events can be seen by any user in the world as it will be open for all. There will be no relational time like  1 min ago , few seconds ago we are providing real times with date and time like 09222015 122345 to show for event start time and event end time. There can be situation where event from New York can be seen by user from London. So how should i store timings of event start time and end time and what should i use to show them as start time and end time to users of different time zone. p  pAnd there will be also user actions to event like they join, like , share , save  this events. So to the users of different timezones how should i store data in my MySqlPHP app. what should i use to save timings of all actions. p  pLike  Event createdtime , eventstarttime, eventendtime.  also for the user action on event i need to store time.  so when i show time it look accurate.p  pThere will be users from different time zones who are creating events . How can handle all this scenario.p  pstrongactually right now we are using server systems datetime .. we use phps date function to store datetime in mysql. we store systems datetime. But it is wrong. And there can be problems in future if we stick to save datetime of the server system. and we do not want to be dependent of server . so need another way out.strongp  pActually right now confused which way to go... Ive read answers but confused to which will fit my scenarioes. p  pWay 1  Save timings of users timezone . Means i have to save time and timezone of user. and show other users on the basis of thier timezone. Now here what time i should use to show event timings of an event in NewYork to user in United Kingdom.p  pWay 2   Use the timinigs of event Time as constants on depeneding on thier location . And for the actions like [like, save , share , join] i save timezone and time of the users timezone.p

Heres a basic example of a site hierachy, much like a filesystem with folders and pagesp  precodeFProducts     FLight Trucks         FZ150             IPictures             ISpecs             IReviews         FZ250             IPictures             ISpecs             IReviews         FZ350             IPictures             ISpecs             IReviews         ISplash Page     FHeavy Trucks     FConsumer Vehicles     IOverview codepre  pIf I writep  precodefrom item in lightTrucks.Items where item.Title  Pictures select item codepre  pWhat is the most intuitive way to express an intent that the query get all items underneath Light Trucks, or only the immediate ones The leastintrusive, lowestfriction way to distinguish between the two intentsp  pMy 1 goal is to be able to turn this LINQ provider over to other developers who have an average understanding of LINQ and allow them to write both recursive and list queries without giving them a tutorial on writing recursive lambdas. Given a usage that looks good, I can code the provider against that.p  pstrongAdditional clarificationstrong I am really sucking at communicating this   This LINQ provider is to an external system, it is not simply walking an object graph, nor in this specific case does a recursive emexpressionem actually translate into any kind of true recursive activity under the hood. Just need a way to distinguish between a deep query and a shallow one.p  pSo, what do you think is the best way to express it Or is there a standard way of expressing it that Ive missed out onp

Negative 2177 pWere looking for a good way to stop fraud on our website. We have a site with constant traffic coming in  we have regular access to the normal info IP, session, cookies etc, plus info that the users have provided.p  pWe need to be able to detect duplicate users in real time. Basically, people are coming in pretending to be different people in order to earn money on each account. We have to stop duplicate users and robots from entering our system.p  pTo stop or slow robots, we implemented a CAPTCHA. This helped a bit.p  pTo try preventing duplicate accounts, we created an IP trending system. It temporarily and silently suspended any account with duplicate activity within the past 10 minutes. It also incremented a duplicate counter on all accounts with activity on that IP  this flag lights up accounts quickly if they have too much duplicate activity.p  pHowever, the above fix doesnt work when someone comes in a day later. It also doesnt work if people use proxy servers or different IPs. It generates tons of false positives with AOL accounts and other ISPs that use shared IP addresses. Is there anything else that we can do to help slow or stop duplicate and robotic fraud in real timep  pIf we can stop them in real time, we can keep our advertisers happy fraud never happens. If we can stop them within a few days, we can at least stop payment to these duplicate accounts, making it pointless to keep trying.p  pAny help on an automated solution detecting this fraud will be appreciated.p

Negative 2177 pstrongtldrstrong I want to load an XML file once and reuse it over and over again.p  pI have a bit of javascript that makes an ajax request to a PHP page that collects and parses some XML and returns it for display like, say there are 4,000 nodes and the PHP paginates the results into chunks of 100 you would have 40 pages of data. If someone clicks on one of those other pages besides the one that initially loads then another request is made, the PHP loads that big XML file, grabs that subset of indexes like records 200299 and returns them for display.

This also happens for ARIMA2,0,0, which is the best ARIMA fit for the data using auto.arima forecast package and for an ARIMA1,0,1 model.p  p2 The intercept value for the ARIMA1,0,0 model is 12260.298. Shouldnt the intercept satisfy the equation C  mean  1  sumAR coeffs, in which case, the value should be 715.52. I must be missing something basic here.p  p3 This is clearly a series with nonstationary mean. Why is an AR2 model still selected as the best model by auto.arima Could there be an intuitive explanationp  pThanks.p

Negative 2177 pAlright, I know questions like this have probably been asked dozens of times, but I cant seem to find a working solution for my project.  Recently, while using jQuery for a lot of AJAX calls, Ive found myself in a form of callback hell.  Whether or not jQuery is too powerful for this project is beyond the scope of this question.  So basically heres some code that shows whats going onp  precodefunction checkformtable    var file  modelstable.json   var errs      var xhr  .getJSONfile, functionjson        for key in json            var k  key       var r  json[k]       .extenderrs, checkitemk,r           return errs  codepre  pAnd... as you can probably guess, I get an empty object returned.  My original idea was to use some sort of codeonReadyStateChangecode idea that would return whenever the codereadyStatecode had finally hit 4.  This causes my application to hang indefinitely, though.  I need these errors to decide whether or not the form is allowed to submit or not as well as to tell the user where the errors are in the application.  Any ideasp  pstrongEdit.strong  Its not the prettiest solution, but Ive managed to get it to work.  Basically, checkform has the json passed to it from another function, instead of loading it.  I was already loading it there, too, so its probably best that I dont continue to load the same file over and over again anyways.  I was just worried about overloading memory.  These files arent absolutely huge, though, so I guess its probably okay.p

If the item information is updated I need to create a new item, and a new GroupRelation. If the Item changes group I have to create a new GroupRelation. And if the Group information is changed I have to create a new Group and a new GroupRelation.

Could this be a problem with the 3.1.3 version of MKMapView or just a quirk in the simulatorp  pMy code isp  precodecombinedView  [[UIView alloc] initWithFrameself.view.frame]  self.awView  [[AdWhirlView alloc] init] awView  [AdWhirlView requestAdWhirlViewWithDelegateself] self.awView.delegate  self  [combinedView addSubviewawView]  mapView  [[MKMapView alloc] initWithFrameCGRectMake0,50,320,430] mapView  MKMapViewself.view mapView.delegate  self [self.view insertSubviewmapView atIndex0]  [combinedView addSubviewmapView]  mapView.showsUserLocation  YES  Create a location coordinate object CLLocationCoordinate2D coordinate  coordinate.latitude  40.1 coordinate.longitude  76.30575   Display map mapView.region  MKCoordinateRegionMakeWithDistancecoordinate, 40000, 40000  [combinedView bringSubviewToFrontawView] codepre  pThanks for any advice.p
Negative 2177 pComing from a VS Setup project, where it automatically adds the dependencies within each project into the resulting msi, is there a way to do that in WiX as wellp  pFor example project A references b.dll which exists in the GAC. It seems that b.dll is not being added to the resulting msi and it then crashes when the application is ran. Do I have to manually add b.dll as a component in the .wxs file or can it be done automatically like the VS setup projectp  pThanksp

Negative 2177 pIm trying to grasp my head around the best way to carry out something.p  pIm creating a very simple forum, using ASP.NET MVC and LINQ to SQL. Very simple means it has no categories, and each message consists of a subject, a composer and the message contents. Comments can be threaded, but only go one level deep if you comment on a child message, it will appear as though you commented on the parent message of that child.p  pOh, I also properly paginated the forum.p  pNow, the ASP.NET MVC flow bit Im trying to understandp  pWhen someone goes to codeHomeForumpagecode I create a model for the view with 2 objects  a list of all the messages to show in the proper order of parents and children. I create the list serverside, and a codeforumMessage newMessagecode object, so if the user creates a new message, or replies to an existing message, I can easily populate the object and send it back to the server.p  pHowever, after reading stronglotsstrong of articles on validation, models, etc., it seems to me as though I would be better off using brokendown message fields to be filled out by the user i.e codeString messageComposer String messageComposer String messageContentscode, since it will be easier to define validation rules for them.p  pThis is for two reasons p  p1 since the codeforumMessagecode object is created using LINQ to SQL, its kinda of an issue to define its validation rules yes, I know you can use a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1420136validationwithaspnetmvclinqtosqlhowdoiavoideditingageneratedsourcbuddy classesa, but Im kinda scared Oo p  pand what seems to be the bigger reason 2 in all validation examples, if the data that was needed to be validated was passed as an object i.e codeforumMessagecode, then it was the only object in the model. I saw no reference to scenarios in which the model consisted of data which was also used simply to populate the views in my case  the forum messages for the particular page. p  pbrp  h2Which brings me to thish2  pstrongSo far, whenever I had to get input from the user, I passed along the objects which I wanted to display or populate as the actual LINQ to SQL objects.strong p  pstrongWas I going about this the wrong way Should I pass LINQ to SQL objects i.e. classes for display purposes, but use plain old fields strings, ints, etc. for the data I want to retrieve, and create the actual LING to SQL object server side, when I get all the data back to the controllerstrongp  pIm at a crossroads here, and would appreciate some help from seasoned veterans p  pThank youp

Returns suddenly start getting doublespaced, unintended formatting gets introduced via pasting from other HTML sources, undosredos are completely broken, formatting becomes excruciatingly difficult to control, etc.p  pI believe this is one of the reasons Google Docs introduced its own much more constrained, nonHTML formatting engine. Is there any opensource library out there that provides something similar Thanks in advance.p

I want to have similar options on the left that relate to their appearance height, weight, skin colour, eye colour, hair colour, that sortve thing, and an updating avatar on the right which reflects whatever changes the user has made. I suppose this would be very similar to creating a Mii avatar on the Wii, or creating a customiseable character in many RPGs Then I want the be able to use this data later on to recommend products based on the options the user has selected. p  pIs there a way that this could be built using PHPjQuery, and if so, where would be the best place to startp

Negative 2177 pIm currently migrating a large project from Flex 3 to Flex 4.5. The problem Im stuck on is network communication were using a custom protocol that we embed in AMF3, but it seems the messages sent by flash.net.NetConnection arent readable.p  pOur Java backend uses some BlazeDS classes to deserialize the message, namely flex.messaging.io.amf.AmfMessageDeserializer.AmfMessageDeserializer, and I can monitor the network traffic with Charles Web Proxy which decodes AMF3. The very simple code herebelow sends a message that can be decoded by Charles when compiled in Flex 3.5, but not in Flex 4.5 I get Failed to parse data com.xk72.amf.AMFException Unsupported AMF3 packet type 17 at 26.p  precodeimport mx.controls.Alert  private function initvoid      var pdl  Dictionary  new Dictionary      var connection  NetConnection  new NetConnection     connection.connecthttplocalhost      var responder  Responder  new Responderresult     connection.callnet, responder, pdl   private function resultpdl  Object  void      Alert.showcoucou, hello  codepre  pIve set up an apache server at localhost80 to test this.p  pHas anyone used NetConnection in Flex 4.5 and encountered deserialization problems How did you solve themp  pThanks,p  pDanielp

Negative 2177 pIn Matlab, I frequently compute power spectra using Welchs method codepwelchcode, which I then display on a loglog plot.   The frequencies estimated by codepwelchcode are equally spaced, yet logarithmically spaced points would be more appropriate for the loglog plot.  In particular, when saving the plot to a PDF file, this results in a huge file size because of the excess of points at high frequency.p  pstrongWhat is an effective scheme to resample rebin the spectrum, from linearly spaced frequencies to logspaced frequenciesstrong Or, what is a way to include highresolution spectra in PDF files without generating excessively large files sizesp  pThe obvious thing to do is to simply use codeinterp1codep  precode  rate  16384  sample rate samplessec     nfft  16384  number of points in the fft    [Pxx, f]   pwelchdetrenddata, hanningnfft, nfft2, nfft, rate    f2  logspacelog10f2, log10fend, 300   Pxx2  interp1f, Pxx, f2    loglogf2, sqrtPxx2  codepre  pHowever, this is undesirable because it does not conserve power in the spectrum.  For example, if there is a big spectral line between two of the new frequency bins, it will simply be excluded from the resulting logsampled spectrum.p  pTo fix this, we can instead interpolate the emintegralem of the power spectrump  precode  df  f2  f1   intPxx  cumsumPxx  df                      integrate   intPxx2  interp1f, intPxx, f2               interpolate   Pxx2  diff[0 intPxx2] . diff[0 F]        difference codepre  pThis is cute and mostly works, but the bin centers arent quite right, and it doesnt intelligently handle the lowfrequency region, where the frequency grid may become more finely sampled.p  pOther ideasp  ul liwrite a function that determines the new frequency binning and then uses codeaccumarraycode to do the rebinning. li liApply a smoothing filter to the spectrum before doing interpolation.   Problem the smoothing kernel size would have to be adaptive to the desired logarithmic smoothing.li liThe codepwelchcode function accepts a frequencyvector argument codefcode, in which case it computes the PSD at the desired frequencies using the Goetzel algorithm.  Maybe just calling codepwelchcode with a logspaced frequency vector in the first place would be adequate. Is this more or less efficientli liFor the PDF filesize problem include a bitmap image of the spectrum seems kludgyI want nice vector graphics li lior perhaps display a emregionem polygonconfidence interval instead of simply a segmented line to indicate the spectrum.li ul
Negative 2177 pI currently face the problem that I have a web application including an axis 2 web service client, which should use rampart for the security header. Therefore, I adapted the axis2.xml file, included all libraries and the rampart module in the webapp. Putting axis2.xml in the classpath eg. WEBINFclassesaxis2.xml works fine. But what about the module repository I tried different locations WEBINFclassesmodules, WEBINFmodules but it simply does not work.

Negative 2177 pI have a Pyramid web application that needs to send emails such as confirmation emails after registration, newsletters and so forth.

Negative 2177 pI am designing a game engine in Java.p  pAt the core of this engine exist the two classes Asset and Attribute, where an Asset has a list of Attributes. Most Attributes need no link back up to their Attribute, meaning that Attributes can and often do appear in the lists of more than one Asset. However, there is an extention of Attribute called UniqueAttribute, which is an implementation for those that are specific to their Asset, and utilise a link back.p  ol lipIdeally, my Assets addAttribute method would look something like this if I cut out the other codep  precodepublic void addAttributeAttribute attribute   ifattribute instanceof UniqueAttribute     UniqueAttributeattribute.setAssetthis   attributeList.addattribute  codepre  pUnfortunately, since they live in different packages, UniqueAttribute.setAsset must be public. This leaves the method open to outside users of the engine to mess with, and while I could just handwave it off by saying using this method directly is a bug  it seems rather sloppy.pli lipThe second option is to provide the UniqueAttribute with the Asset on construction, meaning that the code at the point of creation would look something like thisp  precodeasset.addAttributenew UniqueAttributeasset codepre  pWhile I can add a checkandthrowable or assert to confirm the correct asset is passed in, I am basically relying on the user to connect the two, which I also would prefer not to do.pli lipThe third option is to bite the bullet and put 50 java files all into the same package so that I can just use the standard visiblity.pli ol  pIs there some kind of pattern or something that will help link these two together without exposing the wires, or forcing me to put everything into one massive packagep  pemIrrelevant rant I have always disliked that the concept of subpackages in java has not really been expanded in any meaningful way. A subpackage, as far as java is concerned is simply a different package, and there have been many occasions I could do with more visibility modifiers directly related to this.emp

Negative 2177 pIve been trying to set up my Facebook Application Profile Page by adding an iFrame tab to it. Seeing as this is similar to the process of adding an iFrame tab to a Fan Page, I going through the same process, to no avail.p  pIn order to add an iFrame tab to a Fan Page, one is required to create a Facebook iFrame Page Tab Application process described here a hrefhttpwww.hyperarts.comblogtutorialaddaniframeapplicationtoyourfacebookfanpagefall2012 relnofollowhttpwww.hyperarts.comblogtutorialaddaniframeapplicationtoyourfacebookfanpagefall2012a, and then browse to the newly created apps page, click the Add to My Page link and select the page to which they want to add the iFrame Page Tab Application.p  pNow, if I want to do the same thing, but instead of adding the iFrame Page Tab Application to a Fan Page, add it to an Application Profile Page, then thats impossible because, apparently, Application Profile Pages dont appear in the window where youd select the page you want to add the tab to. Ive seen other applications that have done it, and have tried many approaches, none of which seem to work.p  pAny ideasp  pUltimately, my goal is to create a tab in my Application Profile Page, with my own content which is basically just a picture with a link on it. Tried using the FBML app that Facebook provides but the problem with that is that they dont let you customize the icon to the left of the tab when using the FBML app, and using the iFrame Page Tab Application as described above is a workaround, but then I cant add it to my App profile page p  pThanksp

Negative 2177 pAfter switching a couple of database calls to cache, we actually had worse performance. We noticed a huge jump in CLR time and response time according to new relic. Please see attached graph for the jump cache was introduced 15 at 000. The emonlyem thing that has changed has been the introduction of Azure App Fabric Cache.  Our cache client uses a singleton pattern so there is only one for the instance of the webservice.  the cache factory is created once and then stored away so we are not encuring the overhead of opening the connection each time.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.compL1KF.png altenter image description herep  pFurthermore, NewRelic reports that cache is taking on average 15ms. In many cases, 15ms can be slower than the databasep  pnto The object we are sticking i cache constits of two byte arrays, one has a length of about 421 and the other has a length of 8.p  pNot really understanding why with the introduction of cache we see increased response time.

One engineer reported that the cache layer was built on top of SQL Azure which explained the high request times.  Another engineer denied that claim, but wasnt exactly sure how Shared Caching was implemented. p  pWe were never able to get the azure cache working quickly and ultimately switched from Azure to Amazon ec2.  Once on Amazon ec2 on comparable hardware our response time dropped to about 6070ms. p  pFor anyone else in considering this, this was what we learned in the switch.p  pSQL Azure is shared DB hosting.  You do not get your own DB you are in a server with a bunch of other DBs and if you have any kind of decent traffic, you will get throttled.  They kept telling us about some ticket purchasing success story, but in that scenario they had 750 DBs to process the transactions.  Sharding is no fun, and a better success story is that you handled all those requests with 1DB.p  pWe use SSL, and having IIS manage the SSL really kills your CPU.  Amazon has your ELB do the ssl and then your IIS boxes dont have to.  This freed up the IIS boxes to handle requests faster.p  pAmazon lets you run memcache.  Memcache is awesome.  Having a lightening fast cache layer capable of growing well beyond 4GB, took tremendous load off our DB.p  pWe made the switch back in jan 2012, so its possible Azure has become better in the last year, however I have no plans on giving it a second chance.p

Negative 2177 pI have found many questions here about storing values in viewstate, but havent found a good answer.p  pI have a situation when i retrieve large amount of data from database. Then i filter and manipulate the data according to my needs so it is a preety heavy process. Then I put the result inside a list of custom class. For example lets say this class will be Personp  precodeListltPersongt persons  new ListltPersongt  private void FillPersons     Call to webservice    persons  ws.GetPersonsList     Do all kind of custom filtering     Manipulate the data   codepre  pNow the whole codeFillPersonscode method is a heavy process that returns pretty small amount of data. And unfortunately it cant be moved to SQL and the heaviness is in the process, but that is not the point. p  pThe point is that i need to reuse this data on the page between post backs.  Right now in order to spare the additional call to codeFillPersonscode  I mark Person class as serializeable and store the list in the viewstate, that works fine except the fact that the page becomes 1mb size because of the viewstate. According to what i have read, it is not so acceptable approach i.e. it is not secure and it blows the source code making the page heavy etc. second is what most concerns me p  pSo it leaves me with a session. However session is persisted not only between postbacks, but much after it, even when user leaves the page. Or worst the session will end before user decide to postback. So finding the best time span for session lifetime is mission impossible.p  pMy question is what is the best practice to reuse datasets between postbacks What you guys do in such cases p  pThanks.p  pPS hidden fields etc. is not an option.p

Negative 2177 pHeres my problemp  pIn my android app I use AutoCompleteTextView and refresh items list for each 5 seconds. Refreshing is working, when I call notifyDataSetChanged. But when I type here something and itll give me the list of matching items and then I close it manually, when another thread is refreshing the list and calling notifyDataSetChanged dropdown list is showing automatically even if I closed it before. And its really annoying, because if list is long it takes whole screen and after closing itll appear in another 5 secounds. I tried dismissDropDown just after calling notifyDataSetChanged, but it doesnt have any effect. It looks like dropdown is showing with a little delay. Its also not good way to fix it, because if user hasnt closed the list itll close after a refresh.

Negative 2177 pI have a written an ASP.NET Custom Server Control, which I have working. This control inherits from codeCompositeControlcode and has different views that it can show during its life time. The best analogy would be similar to a Tab control where one control has many user selectable views depending on which tab the user selected. Before someone asks, no, mine is not a Tab control, its an analogy that everyone should be familiar with.p  pAnyway, I want to have the view to be selectable in the Visual Studio 2010 designer. To do this, I created a codeCompositeControlDesignercode with actions just a single combobox to select the view. All of this works just fine, I have even stepped through the code in the debugger and verified that everything is firing off as expected including codeCreateChildControlscode back in the main control, but Visual Studio is NOT refreshing the screen. It only appears to refresh the designer if a tag is addedremovedmodified on the control which will not happen in this case since it is an designeronly featurep  pDoes anyone have a clue as to how to force the designer to refreshp

Negative 2177 pMy app uses Facebook Javascript SDK authorization on client side, and for authorized user app fetches access token from Facebook API, using facebook cookie with signed request and provided codecodecode, and store it into database. p  pEverything is working fine, but im wondering, when I should refresh stored access token What if user have changes password, and have signed inconnected again. p  pAs I understand, now she has new access token, and app should load it from Facebook.

Or maybe im doing something wrongp  pI meanp  ul liIve authorized user on client sideli liIve cookie with signed requestli liSigned request is pretty enough to authorize user on server side validate user credentialsli liI can get codeaccess tokencode by calling Facebook API, anytime when user user makes request to my app because I need a codecodecode from signed request. So, im doing it when I dont have stored codeaccess tokencode or existing codeaccess tokencode has expired.li licodeaccess tokencode just stored in database, and can be used anytime, in different thread, maybe few minutes later mean we dont have user request and cookie with signed requestli liWhat if stored codeaccess tokencode not expired, but invalidated on facebook side I need to fetch new codeaccess tokencode, but cookie has gone at this moment.li ul  pCurrently I see only one way store codecodecode from signed request into databse, and when we have found that we have invalid codeaccess tokencode, try to load it.

Negative 2177 pIm struggling with tombstoning support in my WP 7.1 app. I have a single longlived instance of DataServiceContext, which I serialize and deserialize using a DataServiceState helper.  Upon deserialization, I can successfully retrieve an instance of my User class from the context using a URI as a lookup key. E.g.,p  precodevar context ... a deserialized DataServiceContext ... var userIdentity  ... a URI that identifies a User instance ... User user  null context.TryGetEntityuserIdentity.ToString, out user codepre  pBut if I try to load a property on the User instance that Ive emjust pulled from the contextem as followsp  precodecontext.BeginLoadPropertyuser, Foo, MyCallback, null codepre  pthe context throws an InvalidOperationException with message The context is not currently tracking the entity. It appears that deserialization does not preserve the referential integrity of the context.p  pIve created a simple app to demo this issue. Download from Skydrive a hrefhttpsdrv.msMhctLA relnofollowhttpsdrv.msMhctLAap  pThe app uses the sample data service at a hrefhttpservices.odata.orgODataOData.svc relnofollowhttpservices.odata.orgODataOData.svca. I manually ran dataSvcUtil to create the proxies in ODataDemo.cs. Note that I had to add the DataContract attribute on class DemoService in the generated code, but no other changes have been made.p  pOnce the app is running, tap on the data service context button. The following page will load all of the Products from the data service, randomly select one to retrieve from the context, cache the identity URI of that product, and then load the Category property of the product.p  pNext, tap the serialize button. The app serializes the context using a DataServiceState.p  pFinally, tap the deserialize button. The app deserializes the context, and then attempts the following against the resurrected contextp  ol liGet a product using DataServiceContext.TryGetEntity and the cached URI. li liGet the URI for that same product using DataServiceContext.TryGetUri. li liLoad the Category property of the product.li ol  pStep 1 succeeds, while steps 2 and 3 fail. The fact that TryGetUri cannot find the descriptor for an entity that I just retrieved from the context indicates that something is wrong with the deserialized context.p  pAm I doing something dreadfully wrong Or is this a bugp

Negative 2177 pIm working on an MVC 3 project, and i created a DAL project too. the EDMX is in the DAL project, and of course there is a connection string in the App.configin the DAL project so everytime i want to update the edmx it refers to this connection string of course.p  pThe case is as following, the database is in the APPData folder in the MVC 3 project, and so i can update the edmx file, i have to refer to the database using the physical path in the connection string in the App.config in the DAL project.

Negative 2177 pIs there a simple noniterative way to bind two sockets, one TCP and one UDP, that guarantees both have the same ephemeral portp  pI have a simple server thats connected to via TCP initially, but also transmits over UDP. I dont want to send a UDP packet postconnect from the client just for the server to discover the clients UDP ephemeral port.  I dont want to send the port number via the initial TCP connection message unless I have to.p  pRight now I explicitly bind the client UDP sockets port after a getsockname on the TCP socket to discover the OSassigned ephemeral port.  It hasnt failed yet, but it feels fragile.p  pstrongEditstrong To clarify, the current implementation assumes that the operating system will never assign an ephemeral port for a TCP socket that is already used by a UDP socket.p

Negative 2177 pI have a program in R which calls a couple of Fortran routines, which are openMPenabled. There are two Fortran routines codesub1code and codesub2code. The first one is called twice in an R function, while the second is called once. Both routines are almost identical except for a few minor things. I call the first routine, then the second, then the first again. However, if I have both of them openMPenabled, the function stops doing anything doesnt have an error or stop execution, just sits there when it gets to the second time it uses the first fortran routine. p  pIf I disable the openMP in codesub1code then everything runs fine. If I instead disable the openMP in codesub2code, then it again hangs in the same fashion on the second usage of codesub1code. This is odd because it obviously gets through the first usage fine.p  pI thought it may be to do with the threads not closing properly or something I dont know too much about openMP. However, another oddity is that the R function that calls these three routines is being called four times, and if I only enable openMP in codesub2code, then this works fine ie. the second, third etc. call to codesub2code doesnt hang.

Before when the results were ranked based on location, each distinct location was assigned a rank based on a total of points.  It was clean and the numbers added up.  Now there are duplicate ADs and the ranking is backwards least amount of total ranking points is listed as 1st place.  p  pI simply added the AD column to the INSERT statement and the select statements.

Negative 2177 pIm an amateur when it comes to programming, but Im trying my hand at Python. Basically what I want to be able to do is use math on a dictionary value. The only way I could think to do it would be to assign a dictionary value to a variable, then assign the new value to the dictionary. Something like thisp  precodemydictionary      foo  10,     bar  20,       variable  mydictionary[foo] newvariable  variable mydictionary[foo]  newvariable codepre  pHowever, when I try to assign a variable this way, I get a syntax error. Is there a better and straightforward way to do this p  pEDIT Also, I am only using this as an example. Lets say this is a block of code, not the entire program. The fact that new variable has not been declared is completely irrelevant, I just want to know how to perform math to a dictionary value.  Also, I am attempting to access a dictionary outside of the function I have my code in. p

Negative 2177 pI have a div which contains navigation items, along with a text input which will be used as a search bar.

Negative 2177 blockquote   pFor example, consider a composite primary hash and range key table where the hash key represents a device ID, and where device ID D17 is particularly heavily requested. To increase the read and write throughput for this hot hash key, pick a random number chosen from a fixed set for example 1 to 200 and concatenate it with the device ID so you get D17.1, D17.2 through D17.200. Due to randomization, writes for device ID D17 are spread evenly across the multiple hash key values, yielding better parallelism and higher overall throughput.p      pThis strategy greatly improves the write throughput, but reads for a specific item become harder since you dont know which of the 200 keys contains the item. You can improve this strategy to get better read characteristics instead of choosing a completely random number, choose a number that you are able to calculate from something intrinsic to the item. For example, if the item represents a person that has the device, calculate the hash key suffix from their name, or user ID. This calculation should compute a number between 1 and 200 that is fairly evenly distributed given any set of names or user IDs. A simple calculation generally suffices such as, the product of the ASCII values for the letters in the persons name modulo 200  1. Now, the writes are spread evenly across the hash keys and thus partitions. And you can easily perform a get operation, because you can determine the hash key you need when you want to retrieve a specific device owner value. Query operations still need to run against all D17.x keys, and your application needs some logic on the client side to merge all of the query results for each hash key 200 in this case. But, the schema avoids having one hot hash key taking all of the workload.p blockquote  pcan anyone please explain what are they saying in above examplep  pthanks in advancep  pAl Aminp

Negative 2177 pIm trying to get the list of all the open applications.

Its only grabbing about half the ones I can see in the task manager or that I know I have open. For example, this method doesnt pick up Notepad or Skype for some reason, but DOES pick up Google Chrome, Calculator, and Microsoft Word.p  pDoes anyone know either why this isnt working correctly or how to do sop  pAlso, a friend suggested it might be a permissions issue, but I am running visual studio as administrator and it hasnt changed.p  pEDIT The problem Im getting is that most of the solutions Ive been given just returns a list of ALL processes, which isnt what I want. I just want the open applications or windows, like the list that appears on the task manager. Not a list of every single process.p  pAlso, I know there is bad code in here, including the empty catch block. This was a throwaway project just to figure out how this works in the first place.p

Negative 2177 pI was responding to a slough of basic Java practice test questions and the correct answer to the following question slipped past me while taking the test.p  pQuestion  If an exception is not caught, the finally block will run and the rest of the method is skipped  TRUE or FALSEp  pI am attempting to prove out the answer with the ThrowTest class pasted at bottom but I find Java exception handling to be somewhat unfamiliar.  I compile the class as is with the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException portion of the catch block commented out.  I then execute the class without passing an input parm thus creating an exception the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException exception .  I would expect the final System.out.println would not execute and indeed it does not.p  pI find if I uncomment the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException catch block and recompile, the class then catches that specific error at run time and executes the Rest of method println at bottom.    So, does my code prove the rest of the rest of the method is skipped or do I have to test it from a method other than the main method Maybe there is a more straightforward method of testing it.p  precodepublic class ThrowTest        public static void mainString[] args          try                      String anyString  args[0]             System.out.printlnTry  code executes               catchSecurityException e  any old exception                      System.err.println Error SecurityException.              e.printStackTrace                begin comment     catchArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e                      System.err.printlnError Caught ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.              e.printStackTrace                  end comment       finally                      System.out.printlnfinally block executes                     System.out.printlnRest of method executes        codepre

Negative 2177 pEveryone knows that Javas String object is immutable which essentially means that if you take String object codeacode and concatenate it with another String object, say codebcode, a totally new String object is created instead of an inplace concatenation.p  pHowever, recently I have read a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11408427howdoesthestringclassoverridetheoperatorthis questiona on SO which tells that the concatenation operator codecode is replaced with codeStringBuildercode instances by the compiler.p  pAt this point, I get a bit confused since, as far as I know and think, the codeStringBuildercode objects are mutable due to their internal structure. In this case, wouldnt this essentially make String objects in Java emmutableem  p

Is it better to do this with QGraphicsScene Is there any tutorial or sample code I can seep

Negative 2177 pSo, I want it to be very easy to create all the entities of my game and for other people to come in and do the same. I was thinking I could just let the usersmyself create an XML sheet the stores all the properties of each block Like a Terraria or Minecraft voxel and add Lua scripts that are referenced in the XML for additional functionality of any of the blocks.p  pIm starting to think It would just be easier to let the user create a JAR file full of classes for each block. And then that JAR file could easily be used to get all the blocks. Itd just be interesting to reference all the blocks by a block id without storing all the classes by ID. Or I could give each class a static id. But thats not important.p  pOkay, so my short question isstrongwhat are the pros and cons of storing all the the different types of blocks as classes versus in an XML sheet with Lua for additional functionalitystrongp  pstrongUPDATEstrong It looks like Ill be using pure Lua Looks like an interesting and effective way to do itp

Negative 2177 pI am attempting to create my first custom function in R yay. Ive got something that sort of works now but I think it could be improved.p  pBasically, I want to create my own custom table within R that can be run through xtable for a final report. I want the table to follow this format for each columnp  pgroup1mean, group1sd, group2mean, group2sd, tvalue, pvalue.p  pAt current, my function does this. However, it produces column names e.g., V3 and V4 that I would like to leave blank and I would like to have it loop through multiple dependent variables and append the results as new rows in the matrix automatically.

Negative 2177 pIm working on the design of a reasonably large system to manage a repository of data and vend it out to users through various media. For the sake of argument, lets say that its a big catalog of widgets and orders. One of the things that Im finding unsatisfactory about the design is that Im finding myself with a number of parallel, but distinct, object models in different parts of the system, and lots of code to manage and intertranslate them.p  pTo be more concrete, we have at least the following so farp  ol lipThe Entity Framework strongdomain modelstrong. This is the source of all truth, and whats stored into the database. The codeWidgetcode here knows everything about a widget. While it is a Code First POCO model, EF does put certain constraints on what properties you need to define for the model to work properly. Trying to leave out the foreign key IDs just leads to suffering, IMO.pli lipThe strongview modelsstrong for the admin web app. Most of the display views could just use domain objects. But not every property should be directly editable, some must be editable in a different form than theyre stored, and so on.pli lipA set of strongDTOsstrong for a web API used by a set of native mobile apps. The foci here are a providing only the information that the apps need, and b defining the shape of the JSON that comes out of the serialization process. The output is not always onetoone with the domain model.pli lipWere also working on a parallel web API through which our OEMs can see and manage their own widgets. The requirements are not the same as the mobileoriented API or the internal admin site, so the set of data this API exposes for a codeWidgetcode or our part orders wont 100 match.pli ol  pIts all the same conceptual entities that are being moved around, but different parts of the system interact with them differently, or with different facets of them. Adding a new field, or changing validation logic, or things like that potentially require touching a whole bunch of different codeWidgetcode classes in different namespaces, and adjusting the translating code. Not conceptually hard, but tedious and errorprone.p  pEven if we didnt have aesthetic objections to decorating the domain model with attributes related to rendering views and managing serialization, there is frequently more than one set of views for an entity, or more than one API, so there isnt a single set of instructions to encode.p  pAs someone whose nature demands systematizing and simplifying things, frankly this all just embugs meem. It smells bad. I cant escape the feeling that I emmustem be missing something, and there must be a bettercleaner way to handle this.p  pstrongWhat sort of strategies and tools are available to mitigate or automate this spread Or is this sort of duplication inevitablestrongp  pAm I fighting the frameworks in the way that this system is put togetherp

Negative 2177 pLets consider following two Mercurial scenariosp  pScenario A I have linear history from rev 1 to rev 5, I create branch foobar and commit revisions 511 to it.

Negative 2177 pmy question considers the partial handling in Rails. I just cant get the reason for some design decisions. p  pIf I render a partial like this p  precodelt render partial foobar, object herbie gt codepre  pWhere herbie is an object of class Car. Why is the local variable called codebarcode by default instead of codecarcode which  at least for me  would be more reasonable in most cases. p  pIf various partials share a common layout I have to add the codelayout ...code each time I use coderender partialcode. This seems odd to me Isnt it more likely to have various partials wich share the same layout then the other way around Wouldnt it be more reasonable to define the layout within the partial, or to add a codetolayoutpathcode method to the ActiveRecord Model p  pemUpdateemp  pI get the point that it might be better to use the partial name, as this is well known in the partial context. However the use of the tags locals and as screws up this argumentation. p  pIn an actual case I want to use different partials depending on the state of an object questions that could be open or closed. I moved the decision which partial to render to the codeQuestion.topartialpathcode method which seems to be quite elegant. However I named the partials codeopenquestioncode and codeclosedquestioncode and this makes the partial code unreadable.  It gets even worse if I consider different types of questions.p  pI expect that within a partial we always make some presumptions about the model that is passed in. Thus in codeclosedquestioncode I am quit sure that I get a question  thus I would expect the variable to be called question. On the other hand I can imagine situations where we pass in something different that just behaves appropriated Ducktyping. p  pMy temporal meaning about partials is that within the partial it should be possible to define the name of the given parameter as well as a layout file that is used.  The parameter indeed can be realized by introducing a new variable  question  openquestion which feels a little bit unclean to me. p

Negative 2177 pI have an issue using subprocess.call when calling scripts which in turn run background processes.p  pI am calling a bash script from a python script. python 2.7.3.p  precodebinpython from subprocess import call . . call[runexp,filename] print exp complete . . codepre  pcoderunexpcode is a bash script which runs a process in the background.p  precodebinbash . . runtask autooutput 2gtdevnull amp . . echo runexp finished codepre  pThe coderun taskcode command is another bash script. This is always completed by the time coderunexpcode has finished. p  pRunning coderunexpcode from command line I see expected behaviour and all processes finish completed. p  pAn issue arises when i call the coderunexpcode command using python codecallcode. When using codecallcode I see the output runexp finished but never exp complete. If I remove the coderuntaskcode operation and associated code with its operation in coderunexpcode from coderunexpcode, the codecallcode command runs to completion as expected.

Negative 2177 pI have a fairly complex scenario, so I am trying to distill this down to the basic issue.p  pI have 3 classes simplified herep  precodeclass Base  protected     stdmap ltunsigned int, Nodegt nodes   class Node  protected     stdmap ltunsigned int, Leafgt leaves   class Leaf  protected     myDataStruct myData  codepre  pThese classes represent a 3level tree consisting of a base, some number of intermediary nodes in a codestdmapltint,ptrgtcode, and some number of leaves per node, also as a codestdmapltint,ptrgtcode.  This tree is generated and updated dynamically in an update thread.p  pI have another thread that renders data from these nodes, at a much slower rate than the updates, so I prefer to keep the update action separate from the rendering.  I do not render all of the data on every loop of the render thread either.p  pMy original idea was to register that I wanted to render data from a leaf by calling a function that stores a pointer to the data in the leafp  precodevoid MyRenderClassregisterDataint dataPointer       store dataPointer in MyRenderClass     myStoredDataPointer  dataPointer  codepre  pThen during the render thread loop, I use that data pointer to render the data.p  pSo, the question is strongIs this safestrong  I can handle the case where the leaf or node is deleted by unregistering the data in the respective destructors.  What I really want to know is, strongwill that pointer stay the same as the tree is updated and as new nodes and leaves are added to itstrong  Will the codestdmapcode rearrange or move pointers as it is modifiedp  pOn a related note, can I safely store pointers to the parent nodesbase in the leavesnodes so I can traverse the tree from leafbasep  pI hope this makes sense.  I thought this seemed ok at first, but I want to verify before I go further down this path.  The example is slightly contrived, as the entire code base is much too large to grok.p

My problems are two fold. The first problem I have is that in mB I get an Undefined is not a function on the line codevar modelA  new mAcode when creating a new collection cA. Removing their interdependency stops the error but doesnt help me.

The Windows Phone 8.1 buildin VPN is too primitive and does not work with the VPN I need to use.p  pIs there any way I can develop and app that needs to connect to a server only accessible through VPN. p

Negative 2177 pIm reading about Flask. Given its tight integration with Jinja2 and WTFforms, what happens when I start writing a native mobile version of my website I usually write a bunch of backend API that work independent of the frontend and then code up the frontend using JS. This way, if I have to implement a native mobile app, I can seemlessly use the backend APIs. With Flasks or some other frameworks tight integration with template engines, how should I design my applicationp  pFor example, let us take an example from a hrefhttpblog.miguelgrinberg.composttheflaskmegatutorialpartiiiwebforms relnofollowherea, the author advocates that the login function be written like thisp  precodefrom flask import rendertemplate, flash, redirect from app import app from forms import LoginForm   index view function suppressed for brevity  app.routelogin, methods  [GET, POST] def login     form  LoginForm     if form.validateonsubmit         flashLogin requested for OpenID  form.openid.data  , rememberme  strform.rememberme.data         return redirectindex     return rendertemplatelogin.html,          title  Sign In,         form  form codepre  pHowever, when I am building a native AndroidiOS app, Im assuming that the backend should expose a bunch of API calls that validate the input and do the login for you. And given that mobile is agnostic to Jinga2 or some other templating because everything is implemented native, all this code is useless in the context of native mobile apps. This means, I will have to refactor the realworld Flask code to be compatible with a mobile app. Is this the case or am I missing the higherlevel pointp  pMy specific question is What is the design pattern I should follow in Flask to ensure that my site is web and mobile friendlyp

The final issue I have is with the Scrolling of the TabItem content in my first tab. The requirements call for only the tabs with overflowing content to scroll and not the entire tab control. I.e.  the tab headers should still be viewable including controls above the tab control itself and the scroll bars should appear eminsideem of Tab1s TabItem area.  Ive played with this for hours to no avail.  Im obviously doing something wrong here and could use some assistance. p  pA bit more detail  The binding on the CheckBoxes  ItemControls on the Values collection can have upward of 200  500 controls and thus causes everything to get knocked out of wack. p

Been spending 48 hours on this now and definitely need help.p  pI have a very simple setup. I am using ionicangularjs. For those of you who are not familiar with these, I dont believe it is relevant, but I include this so that you are aware of my set up and the odd syntax of a codescopecode variable...p  pBasically what you see below is a login method that when invoked, executes codefacebookConnectPlugin.logincode. I ordered the parameters codepermissions,successCallback,failCallbackcode which I believe is the correct order as opposed to what shows up in the docs. p  pMy codesuccessCallbackcode function simply gives an alert that a successful login occurred and gives out the accessToken. My codefailCallbackcode function just gives an alert that login failed and gives the response.p  pWhen I run the code on my android device and click login, it fails to login and the response variable is just a string that says JSON Error. No other information. Im completely lost and hoping someone can tell me what the issue is.p  pIve followed the android guide step by step with no errors so I would assume that I should be able to use the plugin.

Negative 2177 pI am developing a WordPress theme that uses a custom Walker class to generate the primary navigation menu. The primary menu has lots of photographs, you can think of it similarly to a hrefhttpwpmegamenu.com relnofollowUberMenua.p  pI obviously do not want to load all of these images on mobile devices, and instead want just a basic text menu if you will.p  pI want to load the correct menu depending on the UA andor users screen size. Is it possible to conditionally load which menu I want to use using javascript, before all the images are loaded to the browser. I do not want to load both menus and then hide one depending on screen size, as the browser will still have to load all of the images in the background.p  pI was thinking of placing the codewpnavmenucode function in a separate PHP file, and then loading that PHP depending on the screen size, but I am not sure if this is safe andor efficient or the right way to do this. I am using Modernizr if it helps. p  pAny ideas are appreciatedp

Negative 2177 pI am concerned with the following question How likely is changing vectors in C, that were allocated in R, to cause problemsp  pI know that rdevelopers recommend readonly access to Robjects and if one wants to modify, we have to copy stuff. And this is exactly what I am trying to avoid in a very limited application frame, which is thisp  pBefore I call my C function I already know that I want to return a vector of doubles and I know how long it is supposed to be. I dont want to deal with external pointers, which do not seem to offer a convenient solution for what I am trying to accomplish. So I take this approach I preallocate the vector I need before calling the Cfunction. I pass this  vector as argument to the function, I grep the pointer to the array and modify elements of that array directly in C. So I dont return anything.p  pSo here is my example C function using inline and RcppEigenp  precodecode lt     int n  INTEGERnR int p  INTEGERpR  double  xin  REALXR double  yin  REALyR double  solin  REALsolR  EigenMapltEigenMatrixXdgt Xxin,n,p EigenMapltEigenMatrixXdgt yyin,p,n EigenMapltEigenMatrixXdgt solsolin,n,n  sol.noalias  Xy    settings lt getPluginRcppEigen settingsenvPKGCXXFLAGS lt pastefopenmp O2 , settingsenvPKGCXXFLAGS settingsenvPKGLIBS lt pastefopenmp lgomp, settingsenvPKGLIBS  fun lt cxxfunctionsignatureXRnumeric, yRnumeric, solRnumeric,nRintger,pRinteger, code, pluginRcppEigen,settingssettings codepre  pNow in R I would do thisp  precoden  as.integer100 p  as.integer3000  Xltmatrixrnormnp,n,p   preallocating the solution vector sol  doublenn   calling the c functions while passing the solution vector   funX,tX,sol,n,p   check if we get same results  dimsol lt cn,n all.equaltcrossprodX,sol codepre  pThat way I avoided an unnecessary copy of the solution vector. I played around with that a bit and I did not encounter problems, but appearently there have to be some as this approach is absolutely not recommended. So what are the traps I am running into  p

I declared newImage like sop  precodepublic static char[][] newImage codepre  pMy logic was that since it is public, the codegetImagecode method would be able to use the codenewImagecode array. That was until I realized that I used codechar[][] newImagecode as a parameter in setImage.

Negative 2177 pI am facing an weird problem with codeasync.jscode. I am explaining the whole scenario. I have two tables in database. Let one be codeXcode with 5 rows and another be codeYcode with 2840 rows. As my project is in codesails.jscode I am using codewaterlinecode as ORM. I am running three functions in codeasync.seriescode. First one for fetching all the rows from table codeXcode, second one for fetching all the rows from table codeYcode. In the third function I am running codeasync.eachSeriescode over all the rows of codeYcode that is fetched in second function and calling an external POST api. So the overall flow is,p  precodeasync.series[     function callback1           Fetch all rows from X     ,     function callback1           Fetch all rows from Y     ,     function callback1          async.eachSeriesallRowsOfY, functionitem, callback2              Call an external POST api.         ,         functionerr               , ],  function err       Do something  codepre  pProblem is, even if codeYcode has 2840 rows, only around 600 api calls are being made, then codeasync.seriescode is beginning to run from the very first. And this incident is going on and on. Why is this happeningp

Negative 2177 pTo explain Ill start by presenting the problem and then my current approach currently just an idea for doing this. However Im happy for my idea to be proven rubbish, so dont let my approach limit your answer. brI have a group of projects and each project has its milestones and therefore a milestones table. The table will look like thisp  precode    Project     Milestone    Date     Status      Milestone 1 1.4.14    Complete     Milestone 2 1.4.15   In Progress  etc. codepre  pEach project would need its own table of this format.p  pstrongGoalstrong Rather than have a sheet per table or table per project I would like to make it so the user isnt overwhelmed by a worksheet or even table for every project.br strongMy Solution strong Just a rough idea but I was thinking I could have one main table that the user readsedits with buttons either side allowing you to switch to the next projects table.br All these tables values would be stored in a dummy sheet hidden and the macro would change the cell references on the main table. So essentially the dummy table would have 3 number of projects columns filled. Im not sure if this is the best way to achieve what I want and would greatly appreciate some help.

Negative 2177 pHow do you use Visual Effect Views with Blur and Vibrancy in Interface Builderp  pIve dragged this item out into the View, then dragged a codeUILabelcode onto the last view in the hierarchy  the vibrant effects codecontentViewcode I assume.

Negative 2177 pFIRSTLY, this question is NOT about codeforcode loop performance. That is just the background.p  pSo, I somehow found out that when using Java, counting down the for loops is much faster than counting up the loop. I mean, codeforint i0 i lt n icode is way slower than codeforint in1 i 0 icode. Yes, I do know that premature optimization is the root of all evil, but I just wanted to find out the reason. So, this led me to think that the difference is because of how codecmpcode is implemented in machinelevel language. One of the ways I could think of regarding writing codecomparecode function natively is like thisp  precodepublic int compareint a, int b    int diff  ab   ifdiff  0      return 0      ifb 0      returnis MSD of a 111      returndiff,0   codepre  pAnd I can check the MSD bit by rightshifting the number by bitmachine size and see if its a 1 or 0. BUT, even for this, Id be needing codecode. That will again come back to the same problem. So, my question is, at the assembly or machine level, how are codelt,,code implemented just using bitwise operations and maybe codejmpcode sequencesp

Negative 2177 pIm using the Facebook SDK for iOS together with the parse.com SDK for my backend but thats not important for my problem.p  pBoth SDKs are working properly.p  pWhen the user opens my app for the first time as long as he isnt logged in, a modal view controller appears which says youre not logged in blah blah and the Facebook login button provided by the SDK.p  pWhen the user tappes the login button, the Facebook app or Safari opens and you can login with Facebook, then you return to my app and you are logged in.

Negative 2177 pI made some changes to a couple of files in my skyartdept repository. I added a Summary and Description and hit the Commit to master button on my copy of GitHub for Mac. I then hit the Sync button. So far, nothing I havent done dozens of times before. This time, though, I realized that I made a small error in the SummaryDescription shortly after I clicked that Sync button. So, before it could finish, I clicked the Undo button next to the commit at the bottomleft of the window, figuring that would cancel the sync and I could fix the SummaryDescription, then hit Commit to master again, then Sync again.p  pAfter trying that, the dreaded Git Error message appeared.p  precodeCannot rebase You have unstaged changes.

Negative 2177 pSo Im trying to learn how to keep a good structure in a WPF application and having a hard time figure out the best way to work with BLL and DAL.  p  pI already have a couple of models in my BLL, for example p  pCustomer, Account,  etc p  pIm also using MVVMLight toolkit to make things easier so almost all my models inherit from ObservableObject.p  pNow Im going to create the DAL and use Entity framework. As all my models use ObservableObject I feel I cant just move them to my DAL to create my tables code first. p  pWould the best way here be to create almost identical objects in my DAL and map all the data to my old models in my BLL when I retrieve them I know its a bit of double the work and so but cant see how I can keep it more clean other than stop inherit from ObservableObject p

Due to   limitations with application domains, unhandled exceptions that are   thrown in addin application domains cause the entire application to   crash, even though the isolation boundary exists. However, WPF and the   .NET Framework addin model provide a simple way to work around this   problem and improve application stability. A WPF addin that displays   a UI creates a Dispatcher for the thread that the application domain   runs on, if the host application is a WPF application. You can detect   all unhandled exceptions that occur in the application domain by   handling the UnhandledException event of the WPF addins Dispatcher.   You can get the Dispatcher from the CurrentDispatcher property.p blockquote  pI try to handle this from my WPF host, and Im only partially successfulp  precode  AppDomain.CurrentDomain.UnhandledException  new UnhandledExceptionEventHandlerx, y gt                              MessageBox.Showy.ExceptionObject.ToString              codepre  pException that was propagated somehow to main appdomain, in this context, CurrentDomain, gets handled in this handler.

I can pull the content without issue.  The second table is where I run into the issues, it either is not linking to the table or does not understand what content to pull.

Negative 2177 pIm making a meal planning  grocery list application with JavaScript and jQuery. Basically, this is how it worksp  ol liThe user adds recipes through a form. The user enters the name of the recipe as well as the ingredients associated with that recipe.li liWhen submitted, each recipe is stored in a codeltdl idrecipeListgtcode element. The name of the recipe is stored as a codeltdt classrecipegtcode and each ingredient is stored as a codeltdd classingredientgtcode.li liFor each day of the week, the user may click on a Plan a Meal anchor. This brings up a copy of the coderecipeListcode. When the user clicks on a codeltdtgtcode, a codeclassmealcode is applied to it and the rest of the list is removed.li liThe next step is for the user to click on the Generate Grocery List anchor. When the user does this, JavaScript should loop through each code.mealcode and create an array, codemealsArraycode. JavaScript should then loop through each codeclassrecipecode and check to see if the code.innerHTMLcode of it matches an item in the codemealsArraycode. It does this just fine, but strongthe problem isstrong after a match is found, it should get the children of the codeclassrecipecode i.e., the codeltdt classingredientgtcode and push them into codegroceriesArraycode.li ol  pJavaScript will not find the children of the codeltdt classrecipegtcode.

Negative 2177 pIm  using WinJS to write a Windows Store app that needs to work with XML documents.p  pI quite easily found the WinJS.xhr function, but Im having trouble figuring out how to use the value I get back from it.p  pSince I have to extract a lot of information from specific nodes, but dont have to do anything with the document as a whole, Im calling with coderesponseType documentcode and saving the coderesult.responseXMLcode property.

This makes no sense considering the XML should supposedly have already been made into a DOM format, per the definition of the document responseType.p  pI tried going ahead and treating it as if it were an codeIXMLDOMDocumentcode, but I get a function not found error on calling codeselectNodescode, so it really isnt that type, either.p  pIn fact, examining the object in the debugger reveals it doesnt even possess the codeparseFromStringcode method.p  pIm hesitant to just look at the members in the debugger and guess at which ones do what I want. Several of them look pretty familiar from manipulating the HTML DOM, but I dont like making assumptions.p  pCan anyone here who might have a better understanding of the WinJS API enlighten me on just how I should be treating this object and what methodsmembers arearent safe to usep  pstrongEDITstrong In order to continue what I was doing, Ive managed to fudge my way along by using codequerySelectorAllcode, which does exist on that object and seems to do what it suggests.

But now, I installed another wordpress in www.example.comdirectory  301 is not working on this directory only. As, I had many other directories like www.example.comdir1 dir2 dir3 and so on. And when I added 301 all of them are also working perfectly. p  pThe only redirect problem is coming for the directory which is added after added 301 redirect. p  pstrongInformation that you may need isstrong  Site is on Wordpress.  To redirect whole site nonwww to www I added this code to .htacessp  precodeRewriteEngine On  RewriteCond HTTPHOST example.com [NC] RewriteRule . httpwww.example.comREQUESTURI [R301,L] codepre  p which is working fine   Now, for that directory which is not working I addedp  precodeRedirectMatch 301 example.comtechnology.         httpwww.example.comtechnology codepre  pwhich I expected to change all internal links of technology and including technology directory to redirect from nonwww to www [after reading from the existing solutions at stackoverflow] but, it is not working. p  pGuide me kindly so that I may correct my mistake.  Looking for the response. Thank Youp

Negative 2177 pI have been trying to recreate a .net Windows Service to utilize the Quart Scheduling system, instead of simple timers. So far the Service runs perfectly when started from inside a separate GUI app that has been built to run the service in an interactive mode. However when starting the service alone from within Service manager I receive a windows service error 1053 immediately after starting it most of the time, it has started a few times on one computer but very inconsistently and even then only after a reboot. After attaching a debugger to the process I can see that it always stops when running GetScheduler the program never throws an exception howeverp  pCurrently I am creating a Schedule factory and running GetScheduler from within the service constructor. I have tried running these commands in the OnStart method instead but I receive an error 1067 then. p  pAlso because Quart is open source, I have tried importing its code and searching for where my program stops inside of GetScheduler but it never stops at the same place.p  pAny ideas for why I cant run the program as a service would be appreciated, Thanksp

To test API I use Chrome Extension Advance Rest Client or Curl, but neither of them work, I mean client works good but the problem is in laravel, I think.      p  pThe problem is that I have manually specefied headers in my request but none of them are appeared in laravel dd    codeddrequestgtheadercode .    p  pI have tried different headers, they worked, not all,but some of them except codeAuthorizationcode header.p  pHere is an examplep  precodeRequest headers  CSP active UserAgent Mozilla5.0 X11 Linux x8664 AppleWebKit537.36 KHTML, like Gecko Chrome43.0.2357.132 Safari537.36 From asdasdsadsa Authorization token20sadsa Accept  AcceptEncoding gzip, deflate, sdch AcceptLanguage ruRU,ruq0.8,enUSq0.6,enq0.4,ukq0.2 Cookie PHPSESSIDsdotvgu9bvm63b947h5d98nk72 languageru currencyUAH codepre  pAnd what I get from dd    p  precodearray9 [   host gt array1 [     0 gt myhost ip   ]   connection gt array1 [     0 gt keepalive   ]   csp gt array1 [     0 gt active   ]   useragent gt array1 [     0 gt Mozilla5.0 X11 Linux x8664 AppleWebKit537.36 KHTML, like Gecko Chrome43.0.2357.132 Safari537.36   ]   from gt array1 [     0 gt asdasdsadsa   ]   accept gt array1 [     0 gt    ]   acceptencoding gt array1 [     0 gt gzip, deflate, sdch   ]   acceptlanguage gt array1 [     0 gt ruRU,ruq0.8,enUSq0.6,enq0.4,ukq0.2   ]   cookie gt array1 [     0 gt PHPSESSIDmyphpsession languageru currencyUAH   ] ] codepre  pAs you can see codeFromcode header works, but Authorization header are not present in dump.br For me it seems that laravel is consuming and removing Authorization header before my middleware, even in case I have commented default middlewares for any request.     p  pPlease help to solve this problem. Or maybe there is another better approach to authenticate in REST API  I would be grateful for any suggestion, criticism.br Thanks.p

Negative 2177 pI am writing an application and running it with Electron.

Negative 2177 pIm writing a file system using Dokan. What I want to achieve is allowing users to access files that are on multiple sources as if they are all on a local folder. i.e. a file can be available locally, on a remote location or in memory.p  pInitially I was creating placeholders that describe where the actually file is available like the win8.1 OneDrive. When the user access a file, I read the placeholders first. Knowing the real location of that file, I read the real one and send the data back to the user application.p  pAfter about an hour of coding I found this idea seriously wrong. If the real location of the files are on the Internet, this will work. But if the file is available locally, I actually need request my hard drive to find two filesplaceholder and the real file. Also, if the file is available in memory users do this to improve performance, I still need to access the hard drive, making it pointless to cache the file into RAM.p  pSo... I guess I have to write my own file table, like the NTFS MFT. Well, the concept of a file table is straightforward. But Im not sure if I can write one thats as efficient as NTFS. Then I started considering a Database. But Im also not sure if this is a good idea...p  pWhat should I dop  pThanksp  pPS. I only have very basic knowledge of File Systems.p

Which, of course, they cant see because the the object is pulled from the codestdvectorltgridCellgt gridCellVectorcode so it only sees the object as a pointer to the base class.

Negative 2177 pI am using IndexedDB as local storage and it is working well.  For reasons that are too detailed to get into here, I often create just a single database and consume it, but in some instances I need to create more.  In some of those cases, these additional databases may end up orphaned or unused, and unnecessary into the future.  Do unused IndexedDB databases somehow age out of some sort of local storage cache presumably in some browserspecific way  I dont mind doing my own cleanup, but since there seems to be no definitive way to get a list of existing databases, I am unsure how to do it.  And the ability of the user to merely delete ALL databases seems like a bit of a blunt instrument.....p  pI suppose I could keep a masterDB with a list of all existing databases.... but even then I dont think I can actually delete them.  The best I could do is empty them I think.p  pGrateful for your insights.p
