Positive 66981 pOur production servers setup is quite standard API  WEB  DB servers.p  pThe API is mainly the one to access the DB, but the WEB does that also in certain cases.p  pI want to create a similar local setup using Vagrant.p  pstrongThis is where I got so farstrongp  pI have 2 git projects, a WEB and an API. I turned them into Vagrant projects, by putting a Vagrantfile in both main directories.. each Vagrantfile points to a dedicated box which includes all the server dependencies.p  pBoth VMs take the code from the mounted vagrant folder. So far  it works like a charm.p  pNow, ive got to the point where I need to create a VM for the DB, the thing is.. I obviosuly dont have DB git project  where do I put the Vagrantfile in this case Its very convenient that the Vagrantfile is part of the code.p  pWhat are the best practicesp  pI hope my question makes sense.p  pThanks a lot.p
Positive 66981 pIm trying to set up two VMs with Vagrant, and one of them needs to be able to ssh into the second one using the private key.p  pI defined both VMs inside one vagrantfile, started them up and then copied the private key from the .vagrant directory into my first VM. I was then able to ssh into the second VM without a password.p  pThe problem is that this is not stable, Vagrant recycles this key each time I do codevagrant upcode and creates a new one. This obviously breaks the ability to ssh from the first VM to the second one until I copy the private key again.p  pI dont particularly care which key exactly Vagrant uses, I just want it to be stable so that I can always ssh between my VMs. How can I do thatp
Positive 66981 pIm setting up Vagrant on a university network. I dont want to use a public network as the university network is quite strict about what can connect. Id rather use a private network. p  pThe problem is, when using a private network Vagrant seems to create a network adapter on the machines, something the students dont have permission to do. Is there any way to set up the private network in such a way that it doesnt require administrator privileges on the machinep  pThe machines are running Windows 7, and the vagrant box is using Virtual Box with a Linux guest.p
Positive 66981 pIm trying to use Packer to a hrefhttpwww.packer.iodocsbuildersvirtualboxiso.html relnofollowbuild a Vagrant box from an ISOa, using a  a hrefhttpsgithub.comboot2dockerboot2dockerreleases relnofollowboot2docker ISOa.  All goes well until I try to run vagrant up, which fails with Error Authentication failure. Retrying....  The box is OK  I can get in with vagrant ssh by supplying a password.  But ssh authentication doesnt work.p  pThis turns out to be a known problem with a a hrefhttpsuperuser.coma745998499251known solutiona  add a public key to .sshauthorizedkeys on the box.   If I do this manually after Ive accessed the box with a password, I dont need the password for future access.  So I updated my Packer script to do that  and found that changes made to the boot volume are discarded without effect.  Packer script changes to other volumes work, but not to the boot volume, which is the one I need to update.  It looks like it can only ever be an image of the ISO.p  pIs my only option to create my own ISO with the public key preinstalled  Is there any way to use Packer to apply the key to the output boxp

S when I run codevagrant sshcode, I ssh into the machine with my custom private key.p  pNow I need to let Ansible SSH into my Vagrant machine and I do not want to use codeVagrantfilecode for it.p  pSo I executedp  pcodeansibleplaybook i hostsdevelopment privatekey.sshidrsa u vagrant dev.ymlcodep  pAnd I have this error returnedp  blockquote   pfatal [192.168.50.5]  SSH Error Permission denied publickey.   while connecting to 192.168.50.522p blockquote  pThe codehostsinventorycode file holds just the IP of my Vagrant VM 192.168.50.5.p  pI do not know why Ansible cannot ssh into the VM. Its using exactly the same user codevagrantcode and key codeidrsacode as when executing codevagrant sshcode.p  pHowever, there is no problem sshing with codevagrant sshcode while the above would not run.p  pAny suggestions would be much appreciated.p
Positive 66981 pI develop maven project on local and want to use maven repository on vm, I think vagrant will be a good way like python with vagrant on Pycharm. But i cant find any guide, how to use java and maven environment on vm p
Positive 66981 pTo test some parts of code which require a fresh VM I use Vagrant. To automate testing I use codepythonvagrantcode package with which I automatically create and destroy VMs.p  pThe problem is that I switched to Docker, so my app in now containerized and therefore I run tests inside a testing container. Even if I install Vagrant inside a container it complains that there is no VirtualBox around. Is there any possibility to solve this problemp  pRight now I created a Makefile function which spins up a VM runs a container executing tests and destroys VM at the end. But that does not allow me to perform VM rollbacks between tests and so on.p
Positive 66981 pOk, my first question in these forums Ill do my best.p  pIm trying to connect an Arduino Uno to VirtualBox v5.04 on COMx where the Arduino is a detected USB device and the filter applied in the USB settings for the virtual machine. The problem I have is that when I attempt to start the guest OS Ubuntu 14.04, same as host, I receive an error stating p  pIoctl failed for serial host device devttyACM0 VERRDEVIOERROR. The device will not work properly p  pErrorID DrvHostSerialFail Severity Warningp  pWhen the device is set to COM1 it eventually boots, though slowly though much faster if on another com port. However, even when the device is eventually seen in the guest os, the Arduino IDE doesnt work as expected I presume, given the warning. There are no blinking lights on the Arduino that suggest coms are occuring, for instance.p  pDMESG on the guest OS shows the Arduino as a recognized device. The Arduino IDE shows a connected device on devttyS1 I believe I had com2 when I checked this. p  pMy user in both the guest and host os the guest OS is also a Vagrant box, if that is helpful are members of the dialout group, if that is helpful.p  pWell, thats a start. If anyone has any notion, Id gladly report any settings to help me troubleshoot this. Thanks in advance.p

Positive 66981 pim trying to create a virtual testing environment. for purpose of testing, im going to send udp packets to application running inside the virtual machine. i want to control source ip of the packet when it is received by the application.p  pi tried different vagrant configurationsp  precodeconfig.vm.network forwardedport, guest 1111, host 11111, adapter 2 codepre  porp  precodeconfig.vm.network forwardedport, guest 1111, host 11111, hostip x.x.x.x codepre  pbut no success.p  pit seems to me that this can not be solved by Vagrant alone. unfortunately, im completely unfamiliar with iptablesroute.p  plet me explain the problem in greater detail ideal scenario is to be able to send this from within virtual environment itself  application is listening on some port P. then test script sends data to host1port1 and it comes through one interface and application sees its source ip as 1.1.1.1, and when script sends packets to host2port2, application sees it as though its coming from 2.2.2.2.p  pkeeping it inside virtual environment is good because i can use just the image across QA local machines and build servers, as it will contain everything.p  pif this configuration is not possible though i dont see why, configuring virtual box to have 2 or more ports forwarded via different interfaces, so that sending packets to them results in different source addresses.p

Positive 66981 pI am making a web app with a team of 5 using Ember and Sails. The frontend will be written using Ember and the backend will be a RESTful API written using Sails.

Positive 66981 pI realise that the Apigility UI requires write access to the modules directory and config directory.  My question is, what permissions does it require to the subdirectories that it createsp  pIn my case, it creates subdirectories such as modulemyapi with 755.  My web server user does not own the file structure or belong to the relevant group, so it cant write to the directories it has created.  I think that might be causing the errors I am getting.p  pUnder normal circumstances I would just modify the users, groups and permissions to whatever I wanted.  In this case, however, I am using Vagrant and the permissions on my synched directories are under control of the host.p

Negative 66981 pIs it possible to setup a JDBC connection to Oracle without providing usernamepassword information in a configuration file or in any other standard readable locationp  pTypically applications have a configuration file that contains setup parameters to connect to a database. Some DBAs have problems with the fact that usernames and passwords are in clear text in config files.p  pI dont think this is possible with Oracle and JDBC, but I need some confirmation...p  pA possible compromise is to encrypt the password in the config file and decrypt it before setting up the connection. Of course, the decryption key should not be in the same config file. This will only solve accidental opening of the config file by unauthorized users.p

Negative 66981 pI need some mind reading here, since I am trying to do what I do not completely understand.p  pThere is a 32bit application electronic trading application called CQG which provides a COM API for external access.  I have sample programs and scripts which access this API from Excel, .NET C, VB and C and shell VBScript.  I have these .NET applications as source code and as compiled executables 32bit, compiled on Windows XP.p  pNow I have Windows Vista Home 64bit which makes my head to spin. Excel examples work just fine in Excel 2003.  Compiled .NET sample executables work as well.p  pBut when I am trying to run .NET C sample converted to and compiled by Visual Studio C Expression, or run the VBScript script, I am getting error 80004005 when trying to create an object.  Initially the .NET application also gave me 80040154 but then I figured how to make it produce 32bit code and not 64bit, so now the errors in C and VBScript applications are the same. Thats all the progress I got for now.p  pAnd yes, I tried running 32bit versions of cscript.exeWScript from SysWOW64 folder on my VBS, but still the result is the same 80004005.p  pHow to solve this problem  I am almost ready to believe it is practically impossible, but the fact that Excel VBA works and .NET executables compiled on Windows XP run just fine just makes me angry.  There should be a way to beat this thing some secret which probably only Windows Vista developers know  I will appreciate any helpp  pPS I believe code samples do not make much sense here, but this is the line of VBScript which failsp  precodeSet CEL  WScript.CreateObjectCQG.CQGCEL.4.0, CEL codepre  pAnd this is Cp  precodeCQGCEL CEL  new CQGCEL codepre  pUpdate Forgot to say a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiUserAccountControl relnofollowUACa is off, of course.

Negative 66981 pI am currently writing an application using Drools 5.0. This application seems to be running a little slow, but I have a theory why. This application receives many updates for facts already in stored in the knowledge session. The Drools update function under the hood really does a retraction then an insertion. This application has over 200 rules. Some of the rules are written to fire when certain facts are removed. Other rules are written to fire when certain facts are asserted into the knowledge session. Since update really does a retraction then insertion will the retraction and insertion related rules still fire during an update Even though nothing is really being inserted or retracted from the knowledge sessionp  pOne thing to note, I hooked up the WorkingMemoryFileLogger to my knowledge session to get a better idea about whats going on. Thats when I saw lots of unexpected retractioninsertion ruleactivation creations being added to the Agenda, but it seems they dont ever get activated. It seems to me that updating facts can be expensive especially based on your fact model, and should me used sparingly. Is this correctp

Negative 66981 pIn our program, a new thread is created each time an HTTP request needs to be made, and there can be several running simultaneously.  The problem I am having is that if Ive got two threads already running, where they are looping on reading from codeInternetReadFilecode after having called codeHttpSendRequestcode, any subsequent attempts to call codeHttpSendRequestcode just hang on that call, so I end up with the previously mentioned two threads continuing to read from their connections just fine, but the third just blocks on codeHttpSendRequestcode until it times out.p  pFrom what Ive been able to find on my own, this seems like it could just be the way wininet works, as a hrefhttpwww.ietf.orgrfcrfc2616.txt relnofollowthe HTTP speca recommends A singleuser client SHOULD NOT maintain more than 2 connections with any server or proxy.p  pIve seen various programs handle multiple simultaneous downloads to the same server, but Id imagine they need to do a lot of extra work to do that, in terms of managing the various connections, or writing their own http interface.p  pIf it would require a lot of extra complexity to set it up to handle more than two active sessions, then I would just change things to only handle one or two files at a time, leaving the rest queued.  However, if there were some lowcomplexity way to allow more than two at a time off the top of my head, Id guess using a new process per download might work, but would be messier, that would be preferable its not like it would be downloading more than 35 simultaneously anyway, and each download is at the users request.  I read some mentions of registry hacks to change the limit, but thats definitely not something Id do.  Any ideasp

Negative 66981 pI wanted to know what the community considers the best practices in respect to mapping class hierarchies with Spring JDBC.  p  pWe do not have the ability to use a full fledged ORM tool, however we are using the Spring JDBC to alleviate some of the tedious nature of JDBC.  One class which we leverage very regularly are the BeanPropertyRowMapper for its ease of use and the ability to have type insensitive bean property access from our result set. p  pI have a class hierarchy that all maps back to a single table taking the tableperhiearchy approach for this small class hierarchy.  As such, the table contains an classId column which can be used to determine what class should actually be instantiated.  Ex. 1  Manager, 2  Employee, 3  Contractor.  All of these are People but each subclass of person has a few attributes which are unique to their class.  p  pMy initial thought is to create a subclass of BeanPropertyRowMapper and try and inject this logic to say if column A  1 then instantiate a Manager and then do your nomral binding.  p  pDoes this seem like a reasonable approach  Are there any other suggestions people may have that have worked for youp  pThanks in advance for your replies, p  pJustin N.p

Negative 66981 pA while back I asked a question about TransactionScope escalating to MSDTC when I wasnt expecting it to. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1690892transactionscopeautomaticallyescalatingtomsdtconsomemachinesPrevious questionap  pWhat it boiled down to was, in SQL2005, in order to use a TransactionScope, you can only instance and open a single SqlConnection within the life of the TransactionScope.  With SQL2008, you can instance multiple SqlConnections, but only a single one can be open at any given time.  SQL2000 will always escalate to DTC...we dont support SQL2000 in our application, a WinForms app, BTW.p  pOur solution to singleconnectiononly problem was to create a TransactionScope helper class, called LocalTransactionScope aka LTS.  It wraps a TransactionScope and, most importantly, creates and maintains a single SqlConnection instance for our application. The good news is, it works  we can use LTS across disparate pieces of code and they all join the ambient transaction.  Very nice.  The trouble is, every emrootem LTS instance created will create and effectively kill a connection from the connection pool.  By Effectively Kill I mean it will instance a SqlConnetion, which will open a emnewem connection for whatever reason, it never reuses a connection from the pool, and when that root LTS is disposed, it closes and disposes the SqlConnection which is supposed to release the connection back to the pool so that it can be reused, however, it clearly never is reused. The pool bloats until its maxed out, and then the application fails when a maxpoolsize1 connection is established. p  pBelow Ive attached a stripped down version of the LTS code and a sample console application class that will demonstrate the connection pool exhaustion.  In order to watch your connection pool bloat, use SQL Server Managment Studios Activity Monitor or this query p  precodeSELECT DBNAMEdbid as DB Name, COUNTdbid as Connections FROM sys.sysprocesses WITH nolock WHERE dbid gt 0 GROUP BY dbid codepre  pIm attaching LTS here, and a sample console application that you can use to demonstrate for yourself that it will consume connections from the pool and never reuse nor release them. You will need to add a reference to System.Transactions.dll for LTS to compile.p  pThings to note Its the rootlevel LTS that opens and closes the SqlConnection, which always opens a new connection in the pool.  Having nested LTS instances makes no difference because only the root LTS instance establishes a SqlConnection.  As you can see, the connection string is always the same, so it emshouldem be reusing the connections.  p  pstrongIs there some arcane condition were not meeting that causes the connections not to be reused Is there any solution to this other than turning pooling off entirelystrongp  precodepublic sealed class LocalTransactionScope  IDisposable        private static SqlConnection Connection            private TransactionScope TransactionScope       private bool IsNested            public LocalTransactionScopestring connectionString                  stripped out a few cases that need to throw an exception          TransactionScope  new TransactionScope            well use this later in Dispose... to determine whether this LTS instance should close the connection.

You want to open your connections as late as possible and hold them open for as little              time as possible.  However, in order to use TransactionScope with SQL2005 you can only have a single               connection, and it can only be opened once within the scope of the entire TransactionScope.  If you have              more than one SqlConnection, or you open a SqlConnection, close it, and reopen it, it more than once,               the TransactionScope will escalate to the MSDTC.  SQL2008 allows you to have multiple connections within a               single TransactionScope, however you can only have a single one open at any given time.               Lastly, lets not forget about SQL2000.  Using TransactionScope with SQL2000 will immediately and always escalate to DTC.              Weve dropped support of SQL2000, so thats not a concern we have.

Negative 66981 pIm using Delphi 2010 and Im wondering if theres a way to trace through code which is in the project without tracing through calls to included VCLs.p  pFor example  you put in a breakpoint and then use kbdShiftkbdkbdF7kbd to trace through linebyline.  Now you run into a call to some lengthy procedure in a VCL  in my case its often a Measurement Studio or other component that draws the doodads for a bunch of IO, OPC, or other bits.  At any rate, what happens is that the debugger hops out of the active source file, opens the component source, and traces through that line by line.  Often this is hundreds or thousands of lines of code I dont care about  I just want to have it execute and return to the next source line in MY project.  p  pObviously you can do this by setting breakpoints around every instance of an external call, but often there are too many to make this practical  Id be spending an hour setting a hundred breakpoints every time I wanted to step through a section of code.  p  pIs there a setting or a tool somewhere that can do this  Allow one to trace through code within the project while silently executing code which is external to the projectp

Negative 66981 pI am poking at XBRL documents trying to get my head around how to effectively extract and use the data.  One thing I have been struggling with is making sure I use the context information correctly.  Below is a snippet from one of the documents I am playing with this is from Mattels latest 10K p  pI want to be able to efficiently collect the context key value pairs as they are important to help align the real data  Here is an example of a context elementp  precode ltcontext ideolPE60500910K0010STD0200912310gt    ltentitygt      ltidentifier schemehttpwww.sec.govCIKgt0000063276ltidentifiergt     ltentitygt    ltperiodgt    ltinstantgt20091231ltinstantgt     ltperiodgt    ltcontextgt codepre  pWhen I started this I thought that if there was a parentchild relationship I should be able to get the attributes, keys, values and text of all the children directly from applying a method  to the parent.  But the children retain their independence though they can be found from the parent.  What I mean is that if the children have attributes, keys, values and or text those constructs cannot be directly accessed from the parent instead you have to determineidentify the children and from the children access the data or metadata that is needed.p  pI am not fully certain why this block of code is a good starting pointp  precode from lxml import etree  testtreeetree.parserctemptestxmlmat20091231.xml  treelist[p for p in testtree.getiterator  codepre  pso my treelist is a list of the elements that were determined to exist in my xml filebr Because there were only 664 items in my treelist I made the very bad assumption that all of the elements within a parent were subsumed in the parent so I kept trying to access the entity, period and instant by referencing just those elements not their childrenp  precodefor each in treelist     if context in each.tag         contextlist.appendeach codepre  pThat is I kept applying different methods to the items in the contextlist and got really frustrated.  Finally while I was writing out the question I was trying to get some help figuring out what method would give me the entity and period I just decided to tryp  precodechildren[c for c in contextlist[0].iterchildren] codepre  pso my list children has all of the children from the first item in my contextlistp  pOne of the children is the entity element, the other is the period elementp  pNow, it should be that each of those children have a child, the entity element has an identifier child element and the period element has an instant child element This is getting much more complicated than it seemed this morning.  p  pI have to know the details that are reported by the context elements to correctly evaluate and operate on the real data. It seems like I have to test each of the children of the context elements Is there a faster more efficient way to get those values  Rephrased, is there a way to have some element and create a data structure that contains all of its children, and grandchildren etc without having to do a fair amount of try else statementsp  pOnce I have them I can start building a data dictionary and assign data elements to particular entries based on the context.  So getting the context elements efficiently and completely is critical to my task.p

The control renders into the following HTML codep  precodeltinput typetext styleheight 20px textalign right classedit idnumberBox gt codepre  pNow at the time i presses any key in this input text field, event fires but those events are not registered here with element perhaps the events are registered by the control somewhere else in the javascript files that are registered along with this control.p  pMy question is how to track that exact event handler, is there any tool for it to see all the associated events of that particular element.p
Negative 66981 pis there any way to determine the visible region of a WPF control that is clipped by parent controls e.g. ScrollViewer, Canvas, or panes p  pBackground of my question we are using the WebBrowser control in our application. Since it is derived from HwndHost, parent controls cannot clip it, i.e. it will overlap parent controls, which does not look nice. Thefore, my idea was to automatically resize the WebBrowser control when it does not fit entirely into the parent controls. Our application is very flexible and therefore it is hard to predict what the hierarchy of parent controls for the WebBrowser control is. Therefore, I would need a method UIElement.GetVisibleRegion that returns a Rect or Geometry with the visible part of the control, in control coordinates.p  pMany thanks for any helpful suggestions in advance.p

Negative 66981 pI developed some components with their own codeOnPaintcodeoverride where I draw them.p  pI now added a status panel which is designed to overlap topmost with part of my form. I use a alphablended color to emgray outem the underlying controls and display a text on it.p  pUnfortunately some of my underlying custom controls paint themselves after the status bar and so draw themselves above the status bar. Debugging I found out that first the status bar on paint event was called, later the paint event of the underlying controls.p  pHow can I make sure the proper order is used to paintp  pWhen underlying components draw themselves the components infront of them should always be automatically invalidate so they redraw themselves but that is not happing. I also called codeSendToFrontcode on the statusbar but that did not helper neither. So I am also asking what is the proper mechanism to maintain the order and how do the core components handle that.p  pstrongEditstrong I also run in this problem With every run of my codeOnPaintcodeevent my overlay gets more and more opaque because it draws with emalpha128redem again and again on itself.p

However, the issue I am running into is how to set and synchronize passwords. Since it appears that the LDAP driver is not able to set the encrypted password correctly I was going to use dscl to set the password after the user is created by the driver. Since this step must occur after the XDS is submitted on the subscriber channel, can I create a followup event to trigger the dscl command or can I use the status message that comes back on the publisher channelp  pIt seems like synchronizing eDir to Apple Open Directory with IDM should not be something new. I am a little surprised that there is not an existing driver configuration in the Designer palette or at least some more detailed examples or discussions in the forums. p

At any      given point during compression, let XYZ be the next 3 input bytes to      be examined not necessarily all different, of course.  First, the      compressor examines the hash chain for XYZ.  If the chain is empty,      the compressor simply writes out X as a literal byte and advances one      byte in the input.  If the hash chain is not empty, indicating that      the sequence XYZ or, if we are unlucky, some other 3 bytes with the      same hash function value has occurred recently, the compressor      compares all strings on the XYZ hash chain with the actual input data      sequence starting at the current point, and selects the longest      match.p blockquote  pI do know what a hash function is, and do know what a HashTable is as well. But what is a chained hash table and how could such a structure be designed to be efficient in C with handling a large amout of data Unforunately I didnt understand how the structure described in the RFC works.p  pWhat kind of hash function could I choose what would make sensep  pThank you in advancep

Negative 66981 pI have a Window Mobile application that Id like to display Arabic characters in.

Negative 66981 pIm having trouble getting the size, in pixels, of a text node using Javascript. Examplep  pre ltp   first text block   ltbsecond text blockltb ltp pre  pI need to get the bounding box of the two text blocks independently. I could get the size of the second block just by measuring the ltb element, but the first one eludes me. It doesnt appear that textnodes in Javascript have a height or width, so far as I can tell.p  pWrapping the first text block in a ltspan and measuring that is not an option, because Ive discovered that a span does not necessarily inherit all of the styles above it, and when I wrap the text it suddenly changes size.

Negative 66981 pI have been using Subversion at my current position for just over one year.  It was one of the first things I did here.  I immediately implemented it as there was no versioning control of any kind in place.p  pLast year, I imported our entire site into Subversion.  I imported it exactly as it was, garbage and all.  PDFs, images, frontpage vticnf folders, EVERYTHING.p  pI felt this would allow me to safely make any changes to the site, and give me a starting point to be able to track changes progress, etc...p  pNow a year later, Im a little upset with some of the way I set this up.  Mainly I want to figure out a better way to handle binary documents.  strongI do not want to put binary files in my repository. period.strongp  h2Please noteh2  pImages, are different. TortoiseSVN can compare images, and they are a different animal. They would affect the look or feel of the site. This is not the case for pdfs, word docs, excel, access dbs, zip files, movies, etc... p  hr  pHere is the process for how we manage website updates to production.  Updates to the site are done weekly, after the site is updated I create a tagged copy for that week.p  ol liI get a request to update a pdf with a new version, and change the hyperlink text to have some new description  li liI update my working copy to the latest version, I make the html code change to the site.  li liI copy the new version of the pdf file into my working copy, replacing the old pdf with the new.  li liAt this point, my working copy shows 2 pending changes, though only one is actually a code change.  PDFs are just content.  li liI codecommitcode both changes to my repo.  li liNow when its time to move to production, I compare my trunk with last weeks tag folder.  li liTortoiseSVN is able to generate an export of only the files that need to be updated on production, with full paths.  I do this so I can alway have the root copied over to the production site.li liI export the files and empty folder structures to a location where another team picks it up and copies it over to production.  li ol  pSo using this method, both the code change and the PDF get moved to production.  But, I dont like it.p  pMy other problem, with not using the above process is that I also dont trust my memory to remember during every move to production to manually copy the pdfs into my changeset prior to moving to production.p

Negative 66981 pOn an ASP.Net page that uses an UpdatePanel containing various validated controls for partial postbacks, the Visual Studio 2010 script debugger window starts to show an ever growing list of Script Block entries which appear to be anonymous our autogenerated functions related to the controls on the panel as it is reloaded. It appears that old script blocks from previous times the panel was updated are not disposed so the list just keeps on growing, slowing down the page and the debugger, until IE is closed whereupon it can take a long time to delete the hundreds of blocks that have appeared.p  pIs this a problem with the way the page is operating or an artifact of the debugger Comparing performance of the debugged and nondebugged page it appears to be the latter, but it would be good to know what is going on and why.p

Negative 66981 pOur app receives a list of records that are to replace an existing set of records. Each record has a primary key based on a sequence, and a unique constraint on another field, which is a foreign key i.e an alternate key on something else.p  pIt goes something like thisp  precode   for each old record       delete the old record    next     for each new record       insert new record    next codepre  pThe problem is that Hibernate is running the inserts before the delete and consequently raising a unique constraint violation. The new records have the same alternate key as the old ones.p  pIf I remove the unique constraint it works fine.p  pWhat is the correct way to do something like this p

Negative 66981 pWe are working on an assignment for a GPGPU course. We picked an algorithm, implemented it on the CPU and are now converting it to OpenCL.p  pThe algorithm weve chosen loads a model as a set of triangles and rasterizes them to voxels. The voxels are defined as a VBO of point data. We then use a geometry shader to convert these points to voxels as triangles.p  pSo our OpenCL program needs to take a list of triangles and output a variable list of points.p  pAnd outputting a variable length array seems to be a problem.p  pThe solution we found is to atomically increment a counter and use that counter as both an index into the output array and a final size of the array. Except... both our GPUs dont support the extension for atomic operations.p  pThis is what we have so farp  precodepragma OPENCL EXTENSION clkhrglobalint32baseatomics  enable pragma OPENCL EXTENSION clkhrlocalint32baseatomics  enable pragma OPENCL EXTENSION clkhrint64extendedatomics  enable  define POS1      i0  3  0 define POS2      i0  3  1 define POS3      i0  3  2  void WritePosition global float OutBuffer, uint inIndex, global float inPosition       OutBuffer[ inIndex  3 ]  inPosition[0]     OutBuffer[ inIndex  3  1]  inPosition[1]     OutBuffer[ inIndex  3  2]  inPosition[2]   kernel void Voxelize      global float outPointcloudBuffer,      global float inTriangleBuffer,      global uint inoutIndex       sizet i0  getglobalid0     sizet i1  getlocalid0      WritePosition outPointcloudBuffer, inIndex[0], ampinTriangleBuffer[ i0 ]       atomicincinoutIndex[0]     inoutIndex[0]  maxinoutIndex[0], i0  codepre  pAnd the output of this is very odd.

Negative 66981 pIve been thinking about meta content in MVC, specifically the page title and the meta description which is useful for guiding the snippet Google shows on your search result. p  pI cant come to a firm decision about where this should live though.

Negative 66981 pIm having problems when uploading lots of files in Django.

But with more lines, and consequently more images, theres a IOError happening in random positions.p  pIve checked several questions about fileimage upload in Django but couldnt find any that is related to my problem.p  pThe model Im using is the Product model of LFS www.getlfs.com. We are developing a system that is based on LFS and to facilitate the creation of dozens of products in batch we wrote some views and templates to receive the main product properties through a spreadsheet. Each line is a product and the columns are the desired properties.p  pLFS uses a custom class ImageWithThumbsFieldImageField to store the products image and when saving the product instance got from the spreadsheet, all thumbnails are generated. This is a time cpu consuming task, and my initial guess is that for some reason the temporary file is deleted before all processing had occurred.p  pIs there a way to keep these uploaded files for more time Any other approach suggested to be able to process hundreds of uploaded files Any hints on what can be happeningp  pHope you can understand my question.

You can read about it here a hrefhttpwww.assembla.comspacesbreakoutdocswikiAssemblaRESTAPI relnofollowhttpwww.assembla.comspacesbreakoutdocswikiAssemblaRESTAPIap  pThe API requires you to set Accept applicationxml on the request header to receive xml data back.

Negative 66981 pIm developing a solution with approx. 15 custom content types. Therefore I created in Visual Studio a SharePoint Project and added content types defined in XML Markup. As some of these content types use references between each other LookupColumns, I added List Definitions and List Instances as well. As lookups can be declared in XML since SharePoint 2010  everythings fine.p  pNow my feature contains all the content types, the list definitions and the list instances.p  pBut the problem is Sometimes the deployment succeeds and sometimes it fails. I suppose this may occur because the elements within the features have no activation order. Now I could change my project and create a feature for every content type and define acitvation dependencies to define an activation order. But this would lead to at least 20 features and in my opinion this cant be the supposed solution to handle this correctly.p  pSo the question is Whats the correct way to deploy content types with lookups to other content types within the same solutionp  pTheres one restriction everything has to be sandboxed because I want to deploy in Sharepoint Online.p  pThanks in advancep  pMartinp

The move gives the company time to reorganise itself without facing its creditors, and Kodak said that it would mean business as normal for customers. The company has recently moved away from cameras to refocus on making printers to stem falling profits. The 133yearold firm has struggled to keep up with competitors who were quicker to adapt to the digital era. Announcing the move to seek bankruptcy protection, Antonio M Perez, Kodaks chairman and chief executive, said The board of directors and the entire senior management team unanimously believe that this is a necessary step and the right thing to do for the future of Kodak.         ltpgt             ltdivgt             ltdiv idthird classnavcontent span20gt                 lth2gtSupport Uslth2gt                 ltpgtLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

Negative 66981 pSo Im writing a web server I know, like the world needs another one And I want to call php through CGI. Ive got a nice working CGI1.1 implementation good enough to run perl cgi scripts for example.p  pNow I want to run php. But when my cgi module calls the php program it returns a 404.p  pHow do I get this workingp  pThe detailsp  pIm running on ubuntu with php5. In my web server, I pass cgi requests to a handler that will find the program and call it with the sc ript as an argument. So here is the code that spawns the cgi processp  precodechdir dir  execve argv[0], argv.data, char const req.posixEnv  codepre  pThe command Im running is equivalent top  precodeusrbinphp5cgi homerafaelwebserverdatacgibintest.php codepre  pThis means Ive set dir top  precodehomerafaelwebserverdatacgibin codepre  pAnd the cgi process should run in that directory. Argv[0] is usrbinphp5cgi, argv.data returns a null terminated array with the following elementsp  precodeusrbinphp5cgi homerafaelwebserverdatacgibintest.php NULL codepre  pThe process environment contains the CGI environment that includes a block of the usual CGI environment variables.p  pWhen I run the above command from a shell, that is by literally typing it into a shell, the script runs fine and php generates the test page. When I call it from CGI it returnsp  precodeStatus 404 Not Found XPoweredBy PHP5.3.101ubuntu3.2 Contenttype texthtml  No input file specified. codepre  pNow I know more or less what is happening. PHP is detecting if it is running in CLI or CGI mode, and searching for the script to run differently in each mode. In CGI mode it is probably using CGI environment variables like SCRIPTFILENAME and DOCUMENTROOT to resolve the script name. Ive tried a whole bunch of things  different settings for these variables. But none of it works.p  pWhat I do know The whole spawning of PHP, and reading output works. For example if I remove  certain CGI variables such that it thinks it is running in CLI mode it works great  generates the page and everything.p  pWhat I need to know isp  ol liwhat is the right way to set up the CGI environment variables for the phpcgi to find my script. li liwhat is the right way to call a php script from exec. Im using full paths for everything as an effort to debug this. Id prefer to use relative paths.li ol  pAll the documentation I can find is about configuring php for cgi on particular web servers. I need to know this from the perspective of someone writing a server.p  pEDIT I have a simpler example that eliminates c. Im pretty sure that part is working correctly anyway.

Negative 66981 pI am having problems updating and inserting data into my database. I have debugged most of the program so I know for sure that the problem is the line of code for updating and the line of code for inserting data. I am very confused because their are other functions that use the same code and all the variables I used in each function were declared locally in the function so I know they are not conflicting. the code at the top that says   is all the database code to open the line of communication with the database and php. That code works Ive already tested it in other programs. I can still pull data with the SELECT code from the database and Ive checked and double checked if the names match up with the table. This code is part of some ajax code so it will update in real time but the post I use with the javascript transfers the data just fine to the php file. So I have no idea what Im doing wrong or if there is just something wrong with the server. If anyone as any ideas please let me know.

Negative 66981 pI have a jQuery fading slideshow I have created for mobile that will be displayed by DGP DoubleClick for Publishers. I first made sure that everything worked by submitting it as a tag with no HREFs. Because this is advertising I would really like to have a different URL for each image, and of course being advertising, this needs to be tracked. My two ideas were to use Google Analytics, and have each URL use this p  precodeonClickgaq.push[trackEvent, campaign, Click1, offer1] etc. codepre  pHaving submitted my jQuery slideshow in that format, I have been told by AdOps they are newbies at DFP that does not work. I was sent a screenshot of the error message.p  blockquote   pSorry, we dont recognize this tag. If you want to track clicks via DFP and avoid  counting discrepancies, you must insert macros manually.p blockquote  pIs a macro just something I add to the URLp  pMy other idea was to use a clickTracking URL creating by Google. AdOps is telling me they read that you can not use a clickTracking URL in DFP, and I have not submitted one for testing, but due to the newbiness and not really tech savvy nature of the person telling me this, I was hoping someone here might know if that is actually true.p  pMainly seeking ideas and suggestions. If I cant track a different URL for each image it wont be a deal killer but it would be sweet. p

Negative 66981 pHey everyone so Ive been trying to write what should be a really easy counting program for my CS class, but for some reason it keeps spitting back out the Please enter a number 0 to stop  prompt and seems to completely disregard the while loop. If the condition inside the while loop is being met, why does the while loop not stop even if 0 is entered I have done C in the past, but Im not really familiar with Javas caveats, so if theres anything weird that Java doesnt like me to do let me know.

Negative 66981 pIve written a small nodeJS server that outputs system audio captured by ffmpeg on Windows using DirectShow to the browser as a streaming MP3 file. The audio needs to be as live as possible, with minimumno buffering, and a skipping effect in the audio is perfectly acceptable.p  pWhen I play the audio in Chrome using the HTML5 audio tag, theres a delay of about 810 secs over a lowlatency LAN connection. I suspected this to be a clientside buffer, and used a Flash MP3 player on the clientside, which brought down the delay to 23 secs.p  pNow, the buffering seems to taking place on the serverside. The documentation for NodeJSs response.write mentions that the data is written kernel buffers.

Negative 66981 pUnder Windows, Im trying to use a 3rd party DLL codeSomeLib.dllcode programmed in C from Python 2.7 using codectypescode. For some of its features, this library uses another COM DLL codeSomeCOMlib.dllcode, which itself uses other DLL codeLibA.dllcode.p  pemPlease note that this isnt about using a COM DLL directly from Python, but its about using a DLL that uses it from Python.emp  pTo make the integration with Python easier, Ive grouped the calls I want to use into my own functions in a new DLL codeMyLib.dllcode, also programmed in C, simply to make the calls from codectypescode more convenient using codeextern Ccode and tailoring the functions for specific scenarios. Essentially, my library exposes 2 functions codedoSomethingSimplecode, codedoSomethingWithCOMobjcode all returning codevoidcode, no parameters.p  pThe effective dependency hierarchy is as followsp  pre classlangnone prettyprintoverridecodeMyLib.dll   SomeLib.dll     SomeCOMlib.dll       LibA.dll codepre  pIm able to write a simple C console application Visual C that uses codeMyLib.dllcode and makes those 2 consecutive calls without problem.p  pUsing Pythonctypes, the first call works fine, but the call that makes use of COM throws a codeWindowsError [Error 529697949] Windows Error 0xE06D7363code. From the rest of the library behaviour, I can see that the problem comes exactly where that COM call is made.p  pThe simple test C application also fails more or less at the same place if codeLibA.dllcode is missing, but Im not sure if its related.p  pIve looked at the dependency hierarchy using a hrefhttpwww.dependencywalker.com relnofollowDependency Walkera. codeSomeCOMlib.dllcode isnt listed as a dependency of codeSomeLib.dllcode, although its clearly required, and codeLibA.dllcode isnt listed as a dependency of codeSomeCOMlib.dllcode, although its also clearly required at run time.p  pIm running everything from the command line, from within the directory where these DLLs are and the C sample executable works fine. Ive tried to force the PATH to include that directory, and Ive also tried to copy the DLLs to various places where I guessed they might be picked up codeCWindowsSystem32code and codeCPython27DLLscode, without success. codeSomeCOMlib.dllcode was also registered with coderegasm.execode.p  pstrongWhat could cause this difference between using this DLL from a plain C application and from Pythons codectypescode when it comes to its own usage of the COM mechanism and possibly the subsequent loading of other DLLs therestrongp  pstrongWhich steps would give at least a bit more information than codeWindows Error 0xE06D7363code from Python, to be able to investigate the problem furtherstrongp  pThe Python code looks like thisp  pre classlangpython prettyprintoverridecodeimport ctypes myDll  ctypes.WinDLLMyLib.dll myDll.doSomethingSimple myDll.doSomethingWithCOMobj  This statement throws the Windows Error codepre  pThe test C standalone application that works, linked to codeMyLib.dllcode makes exactly the same calls within codemaincode.p

Negative 66981 pI am new to Ruby on Rails and am trying to understand its usage beyond the simple blog examples.p  ol lipIt appears that Rails makes it easy to interact with forms and receivepersist objects to the database.  I get this for twitter or blog type applications.  But what about more real world type examples  Lets say we build a site that has a home page full of mostly static information with signinsignup w Devise and OmniAuth.p  pa.  Do I need a home controllerbr b.  For that matter, do I need a controller that corresponds with every type of webpage on the site assuming the page is not 100 static, in which case it would be in the public pli lipWhat if after you login the user is taken to a feature rich page that uses a graph, a data table, and a map  Maybe those 3 things require data from 3 different models.  How is this to be done  I suppose in this case there would be lot of client side logic like Kendo UI or Jquery.  So I imagine that the rails app would basically just become a json API  If a page is going to have a lot of client side whizbang... is rails the right back endpli ol  psorry for the stupid questions.. I am without a rails mentor.p

However, for sporting events such as the NFL, events only occur on Monday, Thursday, Sunday sometimes Saturday and it becomes cumbersome for the user to use the date nav UI control.p  pWhat Id like to do is to change the logic behind the creation of the date nav UI links to include only those dates that have events.  The logic would be something likep  ul liGiven todays date or a date supplied by the user, return the nearest date which has events currentdateli liGiven a currentdate, find the nearest previous date which has events previousdateli liGiven a currentdate, find the nearest next date which has events nextdateli ul  pSo, in the case of the NFL, the date nav UI control might look like, assuming todays date is Nov 27p  precodeMon Nov. 25   Thu Nov. 29   Sun Dec. 2 codepre  pThe way in which to tell if there are any events for a given date is by codestarttimecode field in the DB.p  pI dont like to post a question without some code, but Im looking for some guidance as to how I should approach this without having to hit the DB a ton of times.p  pNOTE 1 When you click on a date for a sport, it returns all the events for that date. The date nav is not used for viewing individual events.p

Negative 66981 pA pure function in functional programming is the one which do not have side effects. One of the meanings of this is it can not change the values of input parameters. Can this be seen as disadvantage for the memory utilization br e.g. Lets say I have a function which simply takes a list and add another element in it. In C it could be as simple as brp  pre code void addElemstdvector vec, int a      vec.inserta  code pre  pThis function clearly doesnt use much memory than already taken by passed object.br But same in Haskell will come to something like this. brp  pre addElem  [Int]  Int  [Int]  addElem xs a  xs  [a] pre  pNow in this computation as xs is not changing its value. So am I correct in saying that at some time the function will be consuming the memory double size of  xs, one for xs and other for the return value. Or somehow lazy invocation makes sure that actually xs is only getting returned by adding only one element at the end br I know that Monad is the way to have something which can have side effect. But can Monad be used to simply modify the input and return its valuebr Also can changing xs  [a] to axs consumes less memory p

Negative 66981 pI have a c class, lets call it codeTwoButtonsHoldercode. In this class, I have 2 codeUIElementscode I wanna animate using StoryBoards. Lets call them codeButtonAcode and codeButtonBcode. Because I wanna have the both of them animate at the same time, I decided to put all their animations in one Storyboard object or is there a better way. So right now Im trying to create the storyboard object in code behind, but I am stuck at the part where I have to define the target property. Normally when I declare animations I use code like this to set the propertyp  precodeStoryboard.SetTargetPropertymyDoubleAnimation,                              new PropertyPathUIElement.OpacityProperty codepre  pnow I have the UIElement within the target Object of the type TwoButtonsHolder. How do I create a storyboard and set the animation target property to codeTwoButtonsHolder.ButtonA.UIElement.OpacityPropertycode Is this bad design for using a single storyboard to animate multiple objects in order to have animation that runs at the same time Just FYI, I wanna try this in code behind, dont wanna go into XAML yet because I find it too complicated and hard to learn IMHO. Thank youp  pEdit Just wanna add that the 2 buttons have different animations, the only reason Im putting them in the same storyboard is for them to start animating at the same timep

Negative 66981 pIm trying to figure out why what I am trying to build using TPL is not working as expected.p  pHeres the scenario I have a bunch of service request classes that go through a central service processor, and return service result objects. Sometimes I need to execute multiple Id say between 2 and 5 of these requests for a single call. So I have something like thisp  precodeServiceRequestType1 Request1  new ServiceRequestType1 ServiceRequestType2 Request2  new ServiceRequestType2 ServiceRequestType3 Request3  new ServiceRequestType3 ServiceRequestType4 Request4  new ServiceRequestType4  ServiceProcessor sp  new ServiceProcessor  ServiceResultType1  sp.ProcessType1Request1 ServiceResultType2  sp.ProcessType2Request2 ServiceResultType3  sp.ProcessType3Request3 ServiceResultType4  sp.ProcessType4Request4   do stuff with the ServiceResult objects... codepre  pThese 4 requests, when running synchronously on my local machine  all process very quickly usually in under 10 ms each even when they are accessing a database for their data. Im happy with that performance. Over time though, as the size of the database grows and performance slows, I wanted to see if I could get multiple requests to run in roughly the same amount of time in parallel using Parallel.ForEach.p  pSo I setup something like sop  precodeConcurrentBagltServiceResultBasegt results  new ConcurrentBagltServiceResultBasegt  Parallel.ForEachltIServiceRequestgtrequest.Requests, serviceRequest gt     ServiceResultBase serviceResult  ExecuteServiceRequestserviceRequest    results.AddserviceResult  codepre  pAs Ive been testing now, the problem is that I get very inconsistent results. Sometimes all requests run great together and all 4 execute in lt 10 ms total. Other times some requests run in lt 10 ms but others take over 3000 ms, and then sometimes one or more will take over 30,000 ms to run. Sometimes one or more requests wont complete at all. Im trying to debug and get to the root cause of this but so far its been difficult to tell where the issue is and why Parallel.ForEach is behaving this way for me.p  pAre there any gotchas or options I should be aware of when using code.ForEachcode  Ive read some other posts on here referencing TPL but nothing really the same as what Im experiencing.p

Negative 66981 pWhile running my program normally in QT Creator on a Linux machine, when I hit the stop button, I am able to handle the SIGTERM signal and gracefully shut down my software. However, when I run in debug mode and hit the same button, no signal appears to be executed and the program just dies. Does the stop button while running in debug mode send some other signal, and if so what signal Is it even possible to handle this from within QT Creator Does it send a signal I cant even handle such as SIGKILL I can gracefully shut the software done in debug mode if I issue a SIGTERM signal to the process of my software, but I was hoping there was a way I could do this within QT Creator as opposed to using another terminal window. p  pThank youp

Negative 66981 pI am a beginner with jQuery, AJAX and php.  Here is what I am trying to achievebr   If a user enters the website through a page that does not already have an email form, show a modal popup asking them to optin with email address.br  Once user clicks submit, change the content in the modal to show a thank you message and then automatically close the modal, allowing the user to interact with the page they originally came to.br   Send submitted info to a databasebr  I do not want to redirect them to a confirmation page upon submit, but it would be OK if the modal did not automatically close and instead just displayed a confirm message.p  pI have to host the php on a different server than the website is hosted on, so I think am having a crossdomain response issue.  I am able to successfully submit the form submission goes into database in Firefox, Chrome, Safari and IE10, and I dont see any error messages in the console when I submit the form.  However, data will not transmit from IE8.p  pIve done some research online and read about using JSON, JSONP, and XDR but a Im not clear as to how to implement over my head right now and b seems using these methods seems to increase the risk of someone getting access to these email address submissions.p  pWhat can I do to make this work in IE8 Any guidance will be appreciated. An iFrame was the closest alternative I could find so far, but the scrollbars do not disappear and they are unacceptable.p  pHere are my scripts web server automatically uses jquery 1.3.2 and I have to use a newer version for the modal, hence the use of noConflict.

Negative 66981 pWe are thinking about going with Hadoop in my company. From looking at the docs in the Internet I got the impression the idea of HDFS is to keep it in RAM to speed up things. Now our architects says that the main idea of HDFS is scalability. Im fine with that. But then he also claims the main idea is to keep it on the on the harddisk. HDFS is basically a scalable harddisk. My opinion is that backing HDFS by the harddisk is an option. The main idea, however, is to keep it in RAM. Who is right now Im really confused now and the point is crucial for the understanding of Hadoop, I would say.p  pThanks, Oliverp

Negative 66981 pI have contact page on my website where I have various social network links plus an email form with links at the side to select each one. Clicking a link makes an ajax request to the server, and on success replaces the html of a common div with the response.p  pEach one has a javascript file associated with it, and this is added as a script tag in the document head on ajax success.p  pThese scripts should evaluate on each load and prepare the DOM in the response. However, I am finding that the first click works perfectly, the script is loaded and executes, but when I go to click on another link, it loads the new script but it never seems to execute.

Negative 66981 pUsing Phonegap and Kendo Mobile UI, my application fills several different listviews dynamically from an SQL db accessed through the openDatabase in phonegap. When I first start the app and click through several different lists the application navigates and populates the views very quickly. After flipping through the screens more than 1520 times the entire app starts to slow down, and eventually crawls to a point where its hard to use.p  pRunning on an iPhone4  5 or simulator doesnt make a difference.p  pStarting the app fresh I am greeted with the first list view. Inspecting the web view and looking at the file list I can see index.html. Under that the normal folders Scripts, Images, Fonts ect.. p  pClicking on a list item drills into another listview. Once the page is changed and the new listview is populated I now notice a new folder under the index.html parent item. A folder called Extra Scripts Inside the Extra Scripts folder I find a new index.html file with no children. Clicking on it opens its contents, 1 linep  precodecordova.requirecordovaexec.nativeFetchMessages codepre  pClicking on another item drills down further by changing the view again and populating another list view. On this third screen now, I notice there are 2 index.html files in the Extra Scripts folder.p  pIn short Anytime these views with lists on them are shown, a new file is attached to Extra Scripts. Once the number of these files gets over 12 or so, the device slows down. I do have other views in my application that do not contain dynamically populated list views, these pages do not cause an Extra Script to be created.p  pI am not sure if the issue exists with the Kendo Mobile ListViews or Phonegap 2.4 itself. I have also upgraded Phonegap to 2.9 which did not help. I also have another application running the same version 2.4 and it does not experience any of these issues, although it does not concentrate on listviews has heavily, several listviews exist and no issue arises. p  pAnother big difference between the two apps is that the broken one fills its data from phonegaps WebSQL database plugin, where as the app that works pulls its data from ajax calls contacting a REST service.p  pBelow is an example of how I create and initialize my list views p  precodeltdiv dataroleview idequipmentPage datatitleMy Network datalayoutmobiletabstrip gt     ltul datarolelistview classequipmentlist datasourceequipmentDS datatemplateequipmentListItemTemplategt     ltulgt ltdivgt     ltscript typetextxkendotemplate idequipmentListItemTemplategt    ltdiv classleft wide linamegtnameltdivgt    ltdiv classhiddenField styledisplay nonegtidltdivgt    ltdiv classrightgt      ltdiv classhiddenField styledisplay nonegtidltdivgt      ltdiv classkmbutton badgeButton idbadgeequipmentidgtltdivgt      ltbutton classeditEquipment styleverticalalign top datarolebutton dataiconcomposegt ltbuttongt    ltdivgt ltscriptgt   function equipmentliTemplateInit   lockOverlay  true   showLoadOverlay   console.logequipmentInit    dbSelectSelect  from Equipment WHERE active  1 and userId    temp.selected.friend gt 0temp.selected.friendtemp.user.userID   AND siteId    temp.selected.site  , functiontx, results     var equipment  new Array     forvar i  0 i lt results.rows.length i            equipment.pushresults.rows.itemi          fillEquipmentequipment     lockOverlay false     hideLoadOverlay       function fillEquipmentequipment    equipment.sortfunctiona, b     var nameA  a.name.toLowerCase     var nameB  b.name.toLowerCase     ifnameA lt nameB       return 1       ifnameA gt nameB         return 1         return 0      .equipmentlist.datakendoMobileListView.destroy   .equipmentlist.html   .equipmentlist.kendoMobileListView     dataSource kendo.data.DataSource.createdata equipment ,     template equipmentListItemTemplate.html      equipmentDS.dataequipment   setBadges   ifequipment.length lt 1     .equipmentlist.htmlltligtltcentergtThere are no equipment to display.ltbrgtUse the  button to add one.ltcentergtltligt   defineListItemActions  codepre  pI tried to upload images but new users are unable to.p

Negative 66981 pI need the user to be able to drag and drop several picturessprites. However, I do not want them to overlap with each other. I plan to add something in the onTouchEnded method but do not know how to do it. p  pThe preferred way is to only change the overlapping part of the two sprites to redtinted. However, if this is not possible, we can also change the two sprites both to redtinted. p  pI tried to use sprite.color  ccRED. but it changed the whole sprite to red color instead of a tinted one. p  pBy the way, both the two sprites are in regular sizes.p

Negative 66981 pIve downloaded strongAlgebirdstrong and I want to try out few things in the strongScala interpreterstrong using this library. How do I achieve this p
Negative 66981 pSo what I am trying to do is this I have a for loop that is generating files. Now this can take some time. For example it may take anywhere between 110 seconds to generate a file in my function lets say. However, I want to use a4jpoll every second to see how many files have been generated so far.p  pFor the way I have done it, it appears that the poll waits until the for loop is finished executing even though its interval is 1 second.

Negative 66981 pI have a JavaFX app which contains a line chart. I want users to be able to select the color of each series in the chart. Since the selection is dynamic I cant use static CSS to set the colors. I also have other controls that I need to set to the same color as the associated series. Its possible to set the line color of a series dynamically using code like thisp  precodeseries.getNode.setStylefxstroke   color   codepre  pThat works well and I can use the userspecified color on the associated controls.p  pMy problem is that I also need to set the color of the symbols for each series to the same color. I cant find any way to do that dynamically. All of the tutorials, documentation, and posts that Ive read on the topic point to the static CSS approach.p  pMost charting widgets make this sort of thing very easy to do, but Ive found no clues here or on the Oracle forums. Any guidance would be greatly appreciated.p  p Update p  pIve found no way to do this other than to enumerate every data point in every series, grab the associated symbol node and set the style individually. Not what I was hoping for. In the process I realized that the default Node allocated for a symbol is a StackPane. I didnt need that flexibility so I replaced it with a Rectangle. This made rendering faster.p

Negative 66981 pI am currently in the process of implementing a backup scheme to run a Cygwin Expect Script. What I would like to do is have task scheduler open Cygwin and run an expect script called Backups. p  pThe issue that I run into is what I believe to be either variable or path based. I have the correct user from Active directory well call it ADsvcbackup set, and I am currently trying to just see if I can get the task scheduler to open Cygwin. p  pSo far it will only open the program if I have the run only when user is logged on radio button pressed. This will open cygwin, but not let me run any further commands and gives me an error. p  pFor example ls gives me bash ls command not found When it asks what program I want to start, I simply point it to the shortcut on my desktop and it then fills in the path Ccygwinbinmintty.exe . Task scheduler does not seem like the most intuitive tool IMO but if I can get it to work I will use it. I also know that cygwin can use cron as well. Would cron be a better optionp

Negative 66981 pWe have separated our business logic layer and business objects into a completely separate projectassembly. Some properties of the models can contain HTML content. In front of the business logic, we have an ASP.NET MVC web application, where users can manage the business objects.p  ul liTo allow HTML content on specific properties, we had to add the AllowHtml attribute. But we cant, because we do not want to reference System.Web.Mvc in our core project.li liPartial classes cannot be used across multiple assemblies.li liUsing the MetadataType attribute is not an option, because it would cause an indirect dependency to MVC or a circular dependency between the core layer and the web application.li liAnother partial solution would be to turn off request validation for the whole request, by using the ValidateInput attribute, but we want to turn off request validation only to specific properties.li liProperties are not virtual, so we cant just simply create a derived type to override the specific properties.li liWe do not want to duplicate our business objects to view models with exactly the same properties and metadata.li liOverriding the model binding logic is not an option.li ul  pSo, how can we indicate to the MVC model binder that we want to allow HTML content on and only on some specific properties, without referencing ASP.NET MVC in our business logic layer Or, how can metadata be injected from another assembly without strong referencesp  pThank you.p

Negative 66981 pIve managed to get a simple router working and even created a child router for my submenu but there are one or two things Im not sure of why theyre there. The docs give you a basic leg up and then youre on your own.p  pSo Im reading the docs from herebr a hrefhttpdurandaljs.comdocumentationUsingTheRouter.html relnofollowhttpdurandaljs.comdocumentationUsingTheRouter.htmlap  pFirst, theres mention of splat routes but it doesnt really explain what they are or how you might use it. All you get is an example bit of JS which means nothing without showing how its used. My assumption would be that they mean some sort of wildcard system of defining multiple routes on one line Not entirely sure though.p  pSecond, when defining the child router they are setting a property on the route of type intro. Theres no mention of why though and it only seems relevant on the child router. Does anyone know what this type refers to and what the different values arep  pOverall Im really impressed with this framework. Ive managed to get a really sophisticated looking webapp roughed out in no time at all. Its just now I want to understand in a little more depth and the docs dont cover that much detail.p  pstrongEDITstrongbr Digging around Ive managed to find out a bit more about splat routes. It looks like a concept that has been copied from backbone plus others.br a hrefhttpbackbonetutorials.comwhatisarouter relnofollowhttpbackbonetutorials.comwhatisarouterap  pBasically if I map the route sectiondetails then this route will match any path that begins section and everything after the  will be passed as a parameter called details. I see how this can be useful for child routers because it will ensure deep linking will work. We want to make sure a request to sectionadmin goes first to the parent router the section part and then to the child router admin.p  pStill not getting this type parameter though. I cant find that explained anywhere.p

Negative 66981 pIm playing around with Microsoft Test Manager 2013 though it appears it is just MTM2012 to try and get a better understanding of test cases and test suites as I want to use this at work. So I was hoping that I could run a test suite on a build which gets included in this test suite. That is what I emWANTem to do, but it could very well be wrong. So maybe a better scope of what Im doing at work might lend to a better answer.p  pMy company makes tablet PCs. I write programs for those tablets. For sake of argument lets just say there are 5 tablets, that run a similar array of OSs. Tablet1,2,3 and 4 can run WinXP, WinXP embedded, Win7, and Win7 Embeded, and Tablet5 can run Win7, Win7 Embedded, and Win8 embedded. Lets say im making a Display test program. Naturally this display test will run differently on each tablet, but the program it self is supposed to be able to handle that along with not being able to worry about OS. So I wrote out a very simple test. Open Program, try to open again, verify only 1 instance, check display, close program.p  pI figured it would be good to make a Test Suite called Complete Display Program Test and put 5 sub test suites to that for each tablet. Then moved the 5 test cases to a single test suite. I configured all test cases to only have the correct tabletOS configuration. Queued a build and waited for it to finish. I then attached that build to the main test suite. I then clicked on run a test for tablet 1 but I didnt see the build attached to the test runner. Ive looked around a little bit to see why or how and havent found anything. Question is is how do I do that Or if you are scratching your head and wondering why in the world I am doing it this way then by all means suggest another way. This is the second time I have ever looked into MTM so I might not be doing it right.p  pThank you for your time.p

Negative 66981 pIn Mongo, I have a documents that look like the followingp  precodedateRange [     price 200,     dateStart 20140101,     dateEnd 20140130 ,       price 220,     dateStart 20140201,     dateEnd 20140215 ] codepre  pNice and simple right Just dates and prices. Now, the tricky party Im is how would I go about creating a query to find the dateRange that fits with 20140112, and then JUST return the strongpricestrong after its found instead of the entire array of dateRanges p  pThese dateRanges can get quite large, and Im trying to minimize the amount of data returned if this is possible at all with Mongo. Note, the date format I can change up if required, I was just using the above for example purposes.p  pAny help is appreciated, thanksp

Negative 66981 pIve created a class called codeDBPDOcode that strongextends the standard PDOstrong class codeclass DBPDO extends PDO code in order to have all the methods and properties that come with PDO with the addition of more control on the queries ie. profiling when developing, etc... and methods that permit to speed up the work when coding queries.p  pId like to improve this class. Im thinking about all the connections that are created throughout the website, most of all are created inside different scopes to perform independent queries. So Im wondering why do I have to create ie. 5 connections on 5 different methodsclassesfunctions of my application, when I could use the same connection on all of themp  pI dont want to use persistent connections for example read a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3332074whatarethedisadvantagesofusingpersistentconnectioninpdoWhat are the disadvantages of using persistent connection in PDOa.p  pId just like to have a class that  when instantiated  gives me an already active connection, if exists, or gives me a new one.brThere is a problem, though. What if I have to visit the results of a query and perform another query at each result I necessarily need two different connections. So Ill need to tell this new class if I want a brand new connection or a used one.p  pI was thinking of writing a new class codePDOConncode, with an static method codegetConnectionforceNew  false code and an static private property codeConnections  arraycode.p  pWhen I need a connection, I writep  precodedbh  PDOConngetConnection codepre  pPDOConn will look if codeConnectionscode already contains at least one connection in form of an instance of my already working codeDBPDOcode class and reaturns that object. If codeConnectionscode is empty, it will create a new object instance of codeDBPDOcode, adds that object to codeConnectionscode and returns it.p  pIf I want to force the creation of a new connection, Ill writep  precodedbh  PDOConngetConnectiontrue codepre  pSo it will create a new connection and adds it to codeConnectionscode. When codegetConnectioncode is called again without forcing a new creation, codePDOConncode will return the first created connection or maybe the last one.p  pstrongQuestionsstrongbr Do you think this is a good way, a good idea Do you have any better suggestion Most of all do you think that theres something I didnt consider in my codePDOConncode class functionality that could cause me problems Im not figuring out right now Do you think that writing a class like that is worthy to manage PDO connections I mean, I started this thread because I wanted to reuse connections when its not necessary to create new ones is this worthyrelevant or I can continue creating how many connections I want, it doesnt matterp  pThank you.p

Negative 66981 pI would like to integrate a SOAP client CXF into my Java app. Ive been trying to find a good design guide on best practices, but to no avail.p  pA naive approach is to use autogenerated client code in the app directly. This would mean that when the autogenerated client code changes the whole app component will need to be updated. I wonder if shielding the app with an integration layer is a good option What I dont like about this approach is that it will require duplicating the autogenerated code in the application domain model packages, which increases the maintainability overhead.p  pI would be very grateful if people can share their experiences  best practices  integration patterns they used for client integration.p

Negative 66981 pIs this possible I have 2 spread sheets, one with a list of items, and how many items are being requested. I have another spread sheet with the same list of items, when inventory will arrive, and how many units. I need to know at what point do we NOT have enough inventory to cover the requested amount. p  pI know how to do the formulas on an individual basis but do not know how to combine them. I need a formula that will look up the items, then reference a table where the column headers are the week numbers, and quantities are listed for each item. It would then do a subtraction of the requested amount, from the inventory through the specified week numbers, and populate with the corresponding week number of when the inventory for that item became negative.  p  pI have my items listed, in one spread sheet. I need to know at what week as listed in the next spread sheet does inventory become negative, so i can say when the orders is at risk.p  pAny Help on this would be immensely appreciated. Even just help with breaking down the logic would be great. Thank you. p

Negative 66981 pCurrently Im trying to query the Windows Search Service from a SQL Server 2008 R2 instance also tested on SQL Server 2012 .

Negative 66981 pI know how to find recurrence relation from simple recursive algorithms. p  precodeFor e.g.  QuickSortA,LB, UB     key  A[LB]     i  LB     j  UB  1     do         do             i  i  1         whileA[i] lt key         do             j  j  1         whileA[j] gt key     ifi lt j         swapA[i]ltgtA[j]     whilei lt j     swapkeyltgtA[j]     QuickSortA,LB,J1     QuickSortA,J1,UB   Tn  Tn  a  Ta  n codepre  pIn the above recursive algorithm it was quite easy to understand how the input size is reducing after each recursive call. But how to find recurrence relation for any algorithm in general, which is not recursive but might also be iterative. So i started learning how to convert iterative algorithm to recursive just to make it easy to find recurrence relation. I found this link a hrefhttprefactoring.comcatalogreplaceIterationWithRecursion.html relnofollowhttprefactoring.comcatalogreplaceIterationWithRecursion.htmla.

I wonder if there is any similar mechanism in iOS Does someone know even better solutionp

Negative 66981 pMany site designs call for a dark background with a lighter foreground page that contains the sites content. When using Bootstrap, it seems logical that one would merely apply the light color to the .container div and be done with it. However, Bootstraps container does not provide any padding between its edges and the columns within, so this solution provides a light background but with the column content flush with the edges  not a good look.p  pThis is a common problem and there are several solutions on stackoverflow and elsewhere for Bootstrap 2, but I couldnt find anything useful for Bootstrap 3.p

Negative 66981 pI am working in ecommerce and I need to find skusimage jpg files from a list of specific skus. I have a large folder housing about 5000 jpg images and need to find all images for each list within the master list. I also need to COPY these images to another folder location of each list of image skus.p  pexample.p  pthe image file would be named strong800061test.jpgstrong and the list document which could be a txt., excel, or csv. would list out each jpg file as strong800061teststrong.p  pThis list of matchning image skus has about 1500 skus of which there are varying amounts of duplicated needed for each image. So I may have 400 image skus that each need 2 duplicate images while I also may have 10, 30, 50, 100 image list skus that will need 10, 20, 30, or 40, image duplicates for each sku.p  pIve found separate bat. files that will duplicate images in a folder for me, however I have not been able to find a bat. file code that will FIND from a list within an image folder and copy those found images into another folder. SO i really need each list of image skus to have their own folders at the end of this thing. So it may be like 75 new folders.p  pCan anyone help Thanks in advancep  pI basically need to be able to copy images from a folder into another folder rather than manually finding and copypasting each of 400 images per folder one by one. But I ALSO need to do this via an already compiled list of image skus. So I will have to do this about 75 times as I have a list of image skus with matching image jpgs. p  pexample I have 400 separate product skus that all need to be duplicated 2x each for their matching image skus as image01.jpg, image02.jpg. I have a previously used bat. file that will duplicate these by altering the count. this gets me the 02. But i need to do it in bulk and fins all of the 400 images in a folder that has about 8000 images in it. So each SKU whether it needs 2 dupes or 100 dupes needs to be able to be searched and found and copied to a folder.p

Negative 66981 pI would like to develop a client side javascript widget that may be included on authorized partner web sites only. The javascript widget will make REST calls back to the main website. Partner web sites should be able to use the javascript widget without installing any server side components. Any attempt by an unauthorized site to use a given key should fail. Obviously, any API keys that are delivered to a web browser would ultimately be vulnerable to exposure even if they were obscured somehow.p  pOne real world example I looked to for ideas is the a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.commapsdocumentationjavascripttutorial relnofollowGoogle Maps Javascript API v3a, which imposes quota limits and optionally allows API clients to restrict access for a given key to specified domains. But it looks like this restriction is based on referers, which seems too easy to forge.

If I send back, for example, 2500.36 it will display fine in 1.4.11 but appear as 2500.00 in 1.4.13.p  pAt first I thought it was me applying some odd filtering to ngGrid cells but having dug into the developer tools it appears that the Breeze backing store is holding the truncated value rather than the full value.p  pI havent been able to check in 1.4.12 as I cant find where to download it without having to build it from source  which requires a bit of grunt work pun intended that Im not familiar with at the moment.

I know they will have correct size after codeviewDidLayoutSubviewscode method is called but it causes double reloading of the codecollectionViewcode items which makes UI glitches at run time.p  pHere is code[collectionView layout sizeForItemAtIndexPath]code method of my implementation.p  precode CGSizecollectionViewUICollectionView collectionView layoutUICollectionViewLayout collectionViewLayout sizeForItemAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath      CGSize innerSize  CGSizeMakegalleryView.frame.size.width  80, galleryView.frame.size.height  40     GLPhotoAsset photo  [PCOpticsPhotoPoint cluster.points[indexPath.row] photo]     CGFloat ratio  MINinnerSize.width  photo.size.width, innerSize.height  photo.size.height      return CGSizeMakephoto.size.width  ratio, photo.size.height  ratio  codepre

Negative 66981 pI have two Java wepapps potentially on different domainsservers using Spring Security for authentication. The first is handling authentication locally storing users in the application database. For the second, I would like to authenticate users using the same users accounts than the first webapp with single sign on if a user is authenticated in the first webapp, it shouldnt have to enter his info again in the second.p  pI identified three potential ways to do this but it doesnt seem very straightforwardp  ul lipShared cookies Using a shared session cookie and the same database for the two applications. It seem relatively easy to do but the two webapps need to be on the same domain which isnt necessarily the case for my applications.pli lipDirectory service Using a central directory service LDAP which would be used by the two webapps to handle authentication. It seem pretty heavy to implement and the users cant be stored in the first webapp database anymore. The existing users accounts would need to be migrated into the LDAP and it would not be possible to create new users using the first webapp.pli lipOAuth It seem to be be possible to make the first webapp handle external authentications requests by providing an OAuth api like Google sign on kind of service. That would allow the second webapp to use this api to authenticate the users, but Im not sure that the signin process would be totally transparent to handle single sign on. It doesnt seem very easy to implement either, as it would necessitate the development of a complete OAuth api in the first webapp.pli ul  pI also looked at this service a hrefhttpsauth0.com relnofollowhttpsauth0.coma that seem to provide an authentication api that can be interfaced with an external database, but Im not sure that it can be interfaced with Spring Security and it also mandate the use of an online solution which isnt ideal. Im not sure that it would handle single sign on either, only shared accounts.p  pIs there any other way to handle this use case that would be more straightforward p

In the GUI, this involves going to codeReleasescode, adding a chained package, linking to the MSI and streaming the file into the project.p  pIve reverse engineered what exactly happens behind the scenes by analyzing the project file as XML. It essentially just comes down to table edits. I understand you can use Windows Installer Automation to open an code.ismcode file and access the database tables a hrefhttpscommunity.flexerasoftware.comshowthread.php109074DirectEditorthroughAutomationobjects relnofollowLINKa.p  pYet, there is a single field in the ISChainPackageData table which I cannot seem to generate or figure out how it was calculated. It is the column titled, codeFilecode. It is a 32 character hex string preceded by an underscore. I have discovered that the only attribute that determines this field is the name of the MSI file being streamed. For examplep  pLinking to a chained MSI by the name of codeTest.msicode, yields code29B31F67F21C9EE77CBF8C4C5D24ACE9code.p  pChanging the name would change this. Changing the file, including replacing it with an empty file of the same name, does not.p  pI believe it is some kind of simple hash of the name, but I havent had any luck guessing it.p  pDoes anyone have any insight on what they might be using herep  pThanksp
Negative 66981 pI was wondering, how does processors know when to stop executing a program. Or rather, when to stop the fetch, decode execute cycle.br I have thought of different ways but not sure which is the correct one or if they are all wrong.br 1 Maybe there is a special instruction at the end automatically added by the assembler to let the processor know this is the end.br 2 When it reach an invalid memory But how does it recognize that.br 3 It loops and rerun the program, but again how does it recognize when to loop or maybe it is added by the assembler automatically.br 4 Or maybe it doesnt stop at all, it will keep running for ever. But isnt that power inefficientp  pPlease advice.br If the answer may vary from processor to processor, lets take MIPS and x86 as an example.p  pThanks.p
Negative 66981 pI am working on a cluster and am using the codesnowfallcode package to establish a socket cluster on 5 nodes with 40 CPUs each with the following commandp  precode gt sfInitparallelTRUE, cpus  200, typeSOCK, socketHostschost1, host2, host3, host4, host5  R Version  R version 3.1.0 20140410    snowfall 1.846 initialized using snow 0.313 parallel execution on 5 CPUs. codepre  pI am seeing a much lower load on the slaves than expected when I check the cluster report and was disconcerted by the fact that it says parallel execution on 5 CPUs instead of parallel execution on 200 CPUs.

I put the codeConfigurablecodeannotation on the class, made sure codespringaspectscode was loaded by gradle, and setup the unit test to use my application configurations. The repository itself is annotated with codeAutowiredcode and codeTransientcode. But still, the repository wont be injected is null. In the test class I wrote, the repository was autowired with not much effort.

Also the image of the third pic should have come to the latter part of the second image since there is enough space. strongIn some pages the content goes underneath the navigation bar as well.strongp  pThe logic is  I get the entire content and when a space is found get the previous word and then check whether the text height is larger than the screen height. If not again check for the next space and append the next word to the previously collected string. Likewise I get the page content.p  pThe code to get the textHeight is as follows,p  precode    public int getTextHeightfinal String text       TextView textView  new TextViewgetContext      textView.setTexttext      textView.setTextSizeTEXTSIZE      TextPaint textPaint  textView.getPaint      return new StaticLayouttext.toString, textPaint, getScreenWidth,Alignment.ALIGNNORMAL, 1.0f, 0.0f, true.getHeight      codepre  pCode for Screen height ,p  precode    public int getScreenHeight        WindowManager wm  WindowManager getContext.getSystemServiceContext.WINDOWSERVICE       wm.getDefaultDisplay.getMetricsdm       return dm.heightPixels          codepre  p Since there is a navigation bar at the bottom I reduced 50 pixels from the screen height. But still the content goes underneath the navigation bar.p  pSo my questions are,p  ol liHow to hide the navigation bar or If it can not be hidden then how to get the exact height of itli liWhat is the reason for the content not to fit on the screen, I really cant find the reason for this.

Negative 66981 pI recently got into c programming, and I have gotten a lot of experience with it. My past few programs have been using the system command, which I have read is supposed to be a really bad idea. First of all, why is it such a bad idea I am using it on Linux for things like clear the screen [ex systemclear ] and to launch other parts of my program, such as returning to a menu [ex system.menu ]. Is it okay to use it for things as I showed above which are the main things anyway, or is there a better solution I just program as a hobby, but I still really dont like making crappy programs.

Negative 66981 pLet me preface this question with I have found a way to make this work, I am just wondering why I had to do it this way. So I have Installed docker on my Droplet, and pulled the ghost image down. I can successfully create a container and run it. It says that its running and everything is fine. Now heres the weird behavior. When I bind it to host port 4040, I cannot access the server. The port is correctly bound because when I try to run a second instance, I am getting the error that it is already bound, I just cant access the application. When I try running nmap it does not show that the port is open. However, when I run the container bound to port 81, I have no problems at all. I am really curious as to why this is happening. Thanksp

Negative 66981 pstrongBackgroundstrong  I am working on a Lync application which acts as a middleman in conversations going to specific users. Basically, a call coming in to UserA is forwarded to UserB, but the caller isnt given UserBs details. From her point of view, she converses directly with UserA. Basically, the application manages two calls for each incoming call to UserAp  ol lifrom the caller to UserAli lifrom UserA via impersonation as the caller to UserBli ol  pEach message is received and is forwarded as is to UserB.p  pstrongProblemstrong There are a few scenarios in which I wish to give an automatic reply from the system. No problem so far, but I want to set a style for these system messages. When chatting in a normal Lync conversation, you are able to select font, color and size, as well as change the direction of the text.p  pNow, for regular communique between the two parties, I simply pass the messages on untouched  i.e., UserA receives a message from the caller, and the system sends the codee.TextBodycode to UserB as is codeecode is codeInstantMessageReceivedEventArgscode. I simply callp  precodeinstantMessagingFlow.BeginSendInstantMessageEncoding.UTF8.GetBytese.TextBody,     res gt              try                      instantMessagingFlow.EndSendInstantMessageres                  catchException ex                      handle exception               codepre  pNow, in this case the formatting get completely lost. I have found no evidence of any sort of emstyleem data passed in the codeInstantMessageReceivedEventArgscode...p  pI know its possible to style the IMs using HTML so that sending the message becomes something likep  precodeinstantMessagingFlow.BeginSendInstantMessagenew ContentTypetexthtml,     Encoding.UTF8.GetBytesltdiv stylecolor bluegt  e.TextBody  ltdivgt,     res gt      [...] codepre  pThis gives me the text in the selected color, but I am having trouble selecting a font, or setting text alignment. No matter what I do, some of the font is displayed in Times New Roman or is it Segoe UI Whatever the default is.... I set font using codefontfamily Arialcode. In some cases, it is simply ignored, but even when it works, setting codedirection rtlcode most of the text is supposed to be righttoleft, or codetextalign rightcode has strongno effect whatsoeverstrong...p  pAm I putting incorrect commands Is there a specific command that I need to use for the textalignment which isnt codetextaligncodep
Negative 66981 pMy issue is that when I have the page full screen I need it to display the header image and navigation bar.

Negative 66981 pGiven an undirected and unweighted graph, I want to find out the minimum sum of k pair of sourcedestination path, under the constraint that each vertex is used at most once.p  pFor example, the following graph with 2 pair sourcedestination A, E and B, F has minimum sum of 7 steps. That is, A  G  H  I  E  4 steps and B  C  D  F  3 steps.p  pa hrefhttpi.imgur.comW4uNiac.png relnofollowhttpi.imgur.comW4uNiac.pngap  pIt is obviously that greedy method of finding all these k path sequentially will result in suboptimal solution. For example, there exists a solution of 8 steps with A  C  D  E  3 steps and B  J  K  L  M  F  5 steps.p  pI have consider to model this problem into minimum cost maximum flow problem. However, such multiple sourcedestination pair cannot always be distinguished. For example, if k  2 and the two pairs are A, B and C, D, the solution applying MCMF may result in A  ...  D and B  ...

I have made a change password section also where I enter the old password in textbox2, new password in textbox3 and confirm password in text box4. What I want is for the password to update from textbox3 or textbox4 and then be set as the password. So whatever was entered in textbox3 or textbox 4 is now the password. And when I enter this new changed password in textbox1 it logs in. I have tried everything I can think of with no solution. Here is the code I am using.p  precodeprivate void button14Clickobject sender, EventArgs e  Main Screen Password Login Button      String passWord     passWord  login      if textBox1.Text  passWord              passWord  textBox3.Text          textBox1.Clear         button1.Enabled  false         button2.Enabled  false         button3.Enabled  true         button4.Enabled  true         button5.Enabled  true         button6.Enabled  true         button7.Enabled  true         button8.Enabled  true         button9.Enabled  true         button10.Enabled  true         button11.Enabled  true         button12.Enabled  false         button16.Enabled  true         button16.Visible  true         button20.Enabled  true         numericUpDown1.Enabled  true         numericUpDown2.Enabled  true          button14.Click  ResetTimer           else              MessageBox.ShowPassword is Incorrect         textBox1.Clear       private void button19Clickobject sender, EventArgs e  Admin Confirm Old Password Button        String passWord      passWord  textBox2.Text      if textBox1.Text  textBox2.Text                             MessageBox.ShowPassword is Correct         textBox3.Enabled  true         textBox4.Enabled  true          else              MessageBox.ShowPassword is Incorrect      private void button17Clickobject sender, EventArgs e  Admin Update New password Button      String passWord      passWord  textBox3.Text       passWord  textBox3.Text      passWord  textBox4.Text      iftextBox3.Text  textBox4.Text              passWord  textBox3.Text         MessageBox.ShowPassword Changed         textBox1.Clear         textBox2.Clear         textBox3.Clear         textBox4.Clear         textBox3.Enabled  false         textBox4.Enabled  false           else              MessageBox.ShowPassword Does Not Match         textBox2.Clear         textBox3.Clear         textBox4.Clear         textBox3.Enabled  false         textBox4.Enabled  false          button17.Click  ResetTimer  codepre  pSo when I click button17 I want the password to change to whatever is entered in textbox3 or textbox4. This new password will then be used to login at textbox1. I hope I described my problem correctly. Any help will be much appreciated. Thank you.  Jennifer.p

Negative 66981 pI know thatp  blockquote   pFor stateless session beans the server can maintain a variable amount   of instances in a pool.   Each time a client requests such a stateless bean e.g. through a   method a random instance is chosen to serve that request.p blockquote  pMy question is Why a pool is needed Shouldnt one instance of a EJB stateless bean be enough to serve all requests p  pAlso if the server for a given stateless bean is using a pool of 10 instances, is 10 the maximum number of requests it can handle on such a bean p  pCan you help me clear my doubtp  pstrongEDITstrongp  blockquote   psection 4.3.14 of the ejb 3.1 spec gives the answer.p      p4.3.14 Serializing Session Bean Methods The following requirements apply to Stateless and Stateful session beans. See Section 4.8.5 for   Singleton session bean concurrency requirements.p      pThe container serializes calls to each stateful and stateless session   bean instance. Most containers will support many instances of a   session bean executing concurrently however, each instance sees only   a serialized sequence of method calls. Therefore, a stateful or   stateless session bean does not have to be coded as reentrant.p      pThe container must serialize all the containerinvoked callbacks that   is, the business method interceptor methods, lifecycle callback   interceptor methods, timeout callback methods, beforeCompletion, and   so on, and it must serialize these callbacks with the clientinvoked   business method calls.p blockquote  pSearching a bit online, my quess is that a thread pool is necessary to the specification that imposes that EJB stateless methods are thread safe. So if we have,say 10 beans in the pool, only 10 requests can be served simultaneously, the other will be queued and assigned to the first free bean. Please correct me if Im wrong.p

Negative 66981 pIm having some trouble in my JavaScript deciding whether to wait for codeanimationendcode events or not and wondered if an elegant solution to this problem exists.p  pLets say that I have a div that animates on page load and fades in, then at a later time I have another script that appends an codeltimggtcode tag to the div.p  pI want the codeltimggtcode to be appended emafterem the animation has completed in order to avoid any stuttering during the animation and to just make it look nicer.p  pCurrently I know that I can write something like this assuming I use animate.cssp  pstrongHTMLstrongp  precodeltdiv classappendimagehere animated fadeIngtltdivgt codepre  pstrongJavaScriptstrongp  precodefunction    .appendimagehere.one[     webkitAnimationEnd,     mozAnimationEnd,     MSAnimationEnd,     oanimationend,     animationend   ].join , function      ltimggt,  src image.jpg .appendTothis     codepre  pThis is fine if the script runs before the animation completes and the codeanimationendcode event fires, but if the script happens to run after the animation ends the codeltimggtcode tag will never be created and will never be appended to the div for example if the handler was set in a timeout or something like that which ran past the animation duration.p  pIs there any way to detect if a CSS animation is currently running so the script can decide whether to wait for the codeanimationendcode or not without having to rely on user added classes or data attributesp  pI ask to not rely on classes and attributes because if Im working with someone elses animations I may not know the classes ahead of timep  pAny help would be appreciated.p

Negative 66981 pIm coding an API with emDjango  DRFem and my client is an iOS app. My users need to be able to authenticate with Facebook. p  pMy initial thought was implementing the strongclientside flowstrong, send the access token via https to my backend, retrieve the user info with that token and registerlogin the user with my back end and it seems this approach is the most popular since its easier to implement using Facebook iOS SDK.p  pIs there any security gain by using the strongserverside flowstrong instead p  pBut Im not sure about the implementation of the server side flow. My understanding is that there would be a link to the third party OAuth endpoint does it need to be a web view or it could be a link to Facebook native app with the redirection URI embedded the app custom URL something like emMyApp...em Am I right. The ressource owner would authenticate and be redirected to the client the app. The iOS app would then get the access code from the URL and send the access code to the back end. The back end then uses its id and secret along that code to get the user access token so its never handled by the client.p  pWouldnt that workp  pDoes it worth it securitywisep  pIn a mobile app, doesnt it makes most sense to use the clientside flow p  pI understand that tokens gotten with the client side flow are in most cases shortlived depends on the provider, but this is not really a problem since Facebook provides an endpoint to trade short lived tokens for long lived ones. p  pThanksp
