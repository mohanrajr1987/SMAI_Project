Negative 1866 pI really dont understand the fascination with XHTML strict.

Negative 1866 pI need the proper terminology for a specific type of function.  p  pSuppose you write a function in your SQL database, whose inputs and outputs are contained within the scope of a database transaction.p  pThat is, if you call this function in the scope of a database transaction, all the data used by the function is available within the same scope.  It can query a database table, but it cant read a file from the filesystem, or ping a web site, etc.  If you call the function twice within a single transaction with codeREPEATABLE READcode isolation, you should get the same result, even if other clients are making changes in the database.p  pLikewise, the function has no sideeffects, except within the same transaction scope.  Changes in state outside the scope of the database transaction are not allowed.  The function shouldnt send emails, nor write to the filesystem, nor store a value in codememcachedcode, etc.  If the function changes data within the database, thats okay because if the calling transaction is rolled back, then the effects of the function are too.p  pThe arguments of the function are okay, since theyre basically used as constants.p  pWhat would be the proper term for a function of this type  Deterministic doesnt really seem to be specific enough.  How would you describe this class of functionp  phr p  pThanks for your answers, but none of them is exactly what I had in mind.  Idempotent gets closest, so I marked that as the accepted answer.  But each of you got an upvote from me regardless.p  ul lipstrongPure functionsstrong have no sideeffects, and their result is based solely on their arguments.  The result given the same arguments is always identical.  This doesnt work because the database functions I have in mind can be based on the state of data, and the function can also affect the state of data.pli lipstrongIdempotent functionsstrong can return a result based on the state of data, and given the same state of data, the result is always identical.  But this doesnt work for what I have in mind exactly the effects of an idempotent functions must result in an unchanging result no matter how many times the function is called.  But theres no distinction between changes made within transaction isolation and changes made external to that scope.pli ul

Negative 1866 pI have some a bit more than a little code where object values from a DataReader are assigned to business object properties.  This code is quite untidy to look at with lots of null coalescing, parsing, etc.  I was wondering how to implement a tidier means of converting the object values from the DataReader to the appropriate values for the object properties.p  pOne option is to have discrete conversion functions for each data type, where the data types on my object properties are limited to a small set of CLR primitive types.

Negative 1866 pHopefully, this fictitious example will illustrate my problemp  pSuppose you are writing a system which tracks complaints for a software product, as well as many other attributes about the product.  In this case the SoftwareProduct is our aggregate root and Complaints are entities that only can exist as a child of the product.  In other words, if the software product is removed from the system, so shall the complaints.p  pIn the system, there is a dashboard like web page which displays many different aspects of a single SoftwareProduct.  One section in the dashboard, displays a list of Complaints in a grid like fashion, showing only some very high level information for each complaint.  When an admin type user chooses one of these complaints, they are directed to an edit screen which allows them to edit the detail of a single Complaint.  p  pThe question is what is the best way for the edit screen to retrieve the single Complaint, so that it can be displayed for editing purposes  Keep in mind we have already established the SoftwareProduct as an aggregate root, therefore direct access to a Complaint should not be allowed.  Also, the system is using NHibernate, so eager loading is an option, but my understanding is that even if a single Complaint is eager loaded via the SoftwareProduct, as soon as the Complaints collection is accessed the rest of the collection is loaded.  So, how do you get the single Complaint through the SoftwareProduct without incurring the overhead of loading the entire Complaints collectionp

Negative 1866 pCustomers from around the world can send certain requests to my server application.

Negative 1866 pI am currently reading about IPC on Windows, and I would like to seek some opinions and recommendations for implementing the following system, which I think is probably quite typical p  pClients generates inmemory data at a maximum rate of about 1kbsec. Ideally, the IPC implementation allows clients to dump these data to a temporary dumping location with fast IO most likely RAM and then move on with their other tasks ASAP. The server would then pop the data out from the temporary dumping location and then write it to some persistent storage, using relatively slower IO. The goal is for clients to make a quick dumpandgo, and then let the server do the slow data saving work.p  pJust writing the above description already seems to suggest that Shared Memory is the way to go. Or are the some other Windowsspecific mechanisms that can achieve what I needp

Negative 1866 pWe have a large ebusiness application server that is out of our control, we can not modify it in any way shape or form. The company behind this application server will also not modify it to our customers requirements. This is due to the fact that they see us as a competitor and they do not wish the customer to use our application as a front end to their application.p  pOur desktop application uses web services to communicate with this application server and each login from the desktop occupies a user slot on the server. The application server offers no functionality that enables us to figure out if a user slot is taken or not. The best solution would be for us to develop an application that sits in the middle of the application server and our desktop client, this application would manage the allocation and deallocation of user slots and the problem is solved. This solution has be declined as the customer does not want to install our application on the ebusiness application server as that would void the user support of said ebusiness server, the alternative would be an extra server but that is something they dont want to deal with.p  pWhich leaves us with the solution that our desktop application has write access to a shared folder. Each desktop application has a UID and we use that UID together with the user slot id and create a file UID.UserSlotId.locked. This would mean that each time a connection is made the desktop application would need to check this shared location and make sure they are not about to use a UserSlotId that is taken.p  pNow I now that the locked file is a terrible solution but the customer has requested this and no matter how much we inform them that this will never be a water tight solution they still want to go ahead. They are under the assumption that a 98 solution is a good solution. So what can the StackOverflow community offer in the way of advice with dealing with such a file locking systemp

Negative 1866 pI am very new to live555 media server but I am trying to use it as the backbone to develop a simple video and audio streaming server using android as the client.  I have been desperately testing and have managed to encode a simple test video in H.264 with the extension .264 and streamed it to the handset using the complete live555 media server.  The problem with this is I constructed the .264 file from a raw avi recording and lowered its spec considerably making the fame size 320X240 and bit rate and frame rate very low. I really want my system to be able to stream any mp4 file which live555 does not support at the moment but is natively supported by android. p  pCan I implement this formats into the live555 code without knowing too much about encoding or streaming  If this is not possible for me can some body please advise me on the next steps to take. I am quite sure that trying to encode the mp4 to a raw .264 file upon request at the server is very far from the right answer but atm it is the only format I can stream. Any help or direction would be greatly appreciated.  p

Negative 1866 pI have a pretty large system to deploy, plenty of components and built to be quite extensible.

I am more likely to deploy everything into a single folder than to abandon this stance. Furthermore I dont want to modify any program code which assumes this deployment structure.

Negative 1866 pIm having hard time consuming a secure WCF Web Service from a PHP site. My knowledge in PHP are limited, I found various examples on the Web but didnt succeeded making them working yet.p  pI have a Silverlight application that also consume this WebService and it works fine. But when I run the PHP site, I get this error p  blockquote   pMessageSecurityException Security processor was unable to find a security header in the message. This might be because the message is an unsecured fault or because there is a binding mismatch between the communicating parties.   This can occur if the service is configured for security and the client is not using security.p blockquote  pI also tried to change the customBinding to a basicHttpBinding. When I do that, the Custom Username validator is not called anymore. But, using basicHttpBinding and removing credentials validation on my WCF Service works Besides the fact that it is unsecured.

Negative 1866 pI have an app with an SQLite database for storing information for a users account. I designed the database on the assumption that the app would only have one user. As such, the users ID isnt stored in the database but it is stored in a central database on a server. However, it is possible to logout of the app and let another user log in, but the problem with this is at the moment, their data is downloaded and then appended to the other users data. This is not what I want to happen, but Im not sure how best to change the databse design to solve this.  I have thought aboutp  ol liOne database per user.  Could result in unecessary data storage if a user just logs in once on their friends phone and never again.  Also I guess this could be hard to manage.li liAdd a user ID column to all tables, so appending doesnt cause a problem. Still has the unecessary data issue that 1 has, and loses 1s modularity.li liWipe the database when the user logs out.  If the user has a lot of data on the server, it will take a long time to sync the data when the application starts this will be done on another thread, but its still a pain.li ol  pIs one of these approaches good  Or is there a better way to do thisp

Negative 1866 pThanks to the help here i got a mostly working socks4 proxy based on poll. I am using this programm to learn C and socket programming. This programm is still lacking send checks for partial writes, but i am fairly certain that is not the cause of the current issues with it. It is working OK with some proxied TCPconnections, for instance netcat or even chrome though that throws excessives recv errors. It doesnt work with firefox or ssh. I am not sure what difference is there, but i think somehow i must be handling the sockets incorrectly. The error currently presents itself as such with nonworking clientsp  ol liclient sends socks4 connection request to proxy OKli liproxy sends socks4 OK to client OKli liclient sends TCP segments with payload data to proxy OKli liProxy forwards TCP segments with payload data to server OKli liServer sends TCP segments with payload data to proxy OKli liProxy sends TCP segments with payload to client OKli liclient does nothing NOT OKli ol  pI doublechecked the tcpsegment payload and it is exactly the same for a tcp segment from a proxy and from a connection directly from a server. For instance an ssh client should send a ssh client hello to the server after he received an ssh server hello.p  pif i connect via netcat as a client i can verify that i get the banner correctlyp  prootubuntu nc X 4 x 127.0.0.18000 127.0.0.1 22p  pSSH2.0OpenSSH5.3p1 Debian3ubuntu7p  pI see in wireshark that the ssh client gets this banner as well, but he does nothing.

Negative 1866 pWell, the initial thing to my mind was how to make sure if a hrefhttppydispatcher.sourceforge.netpydispatchera or a hrefhttppubsub.sourceforge.netpubsuba is threadsafe or not. pubsub might be a little tricky or complex to figure out but pydispatcher seems simple to realize. Then I started to wonder how to figure out if a python module threadsafe or not. Any heuristicsp

Negative 1866 pIm very new to MVC, and so Ive been scouring the net in an attempt to build my own framework to get a real understanding on how the whole concept works. p  pAnyway, almost all tutorials out there that deal with MVC always seem to assign data that needs to be displayed in the view to an intermediary variable that is THEN used in the view. p  pMy question is, why bother with that extra stepp  pMost MVC implementations end up including the view WITHIN the controller... so if thats the case, why waste timememorycpu cycles to create an intermediary variablearray that is then passed to the View when the View ends up being included with the controller at the end. p  pWould it not make more sense to simply use the Controller variables directly in the View itself p  pHeres a code example to hopefully clarify what I meanp  precodeclass NewsController    public function mainarray getVars      newsModel  new NewsModel      get an article     article  newsModelgtgetarticlegetVars[article]      create a new view and pass it our template name     view  new ViewModelthisgttemplateName      assign article data to view     viewgtassigntitle , article[title]     viewgtassigncontent , article[content]     viewgtrender  codepre  pThe render function is basically just an include to bring the View into the Controller to be displayed down the chain.

Negative 1866 pIve always been told vectors are fast, and in my years of programming experience, Ive never seen anything to contract that.  I decided to prematurely optimize and write a associative class that was a thin wrapper around a sequential container namely codestdvectorcode and provided the same interface as codestdmapcode.  Most of the code was really easy, and I got it working with little difficulty.  p  pHowever, in my tests of various sized POD types 4 to 64 bytes, and codestdstringscode, with counts varying from eight to twothousand, codestdmapfindcode was faster than my codeassociativefindcode, usually around 15 faster, for almost all tests.  I made a a hrefhttphomepage1.nifty.comalgafieldsscce.htmlShort, Self Contained, Correct Compilable, Examplea that clearly shows this a hrefhttpideone.com41iKtat ideonea  I checked MSVC9s implementation of codestdmapfindcode and confirmed that it matches my codevecfindcode and codestdlowerboundcode code quite closely, and cannot account for why the codestdmapfindcode runs faster, except for a discussion on Stack Overflow where people speculated that the binary search method does not benefit at all from the locality of the vector until the last comparison making it no faster, and that its requires pointer arithmetic that codestdmapcode nodes dont require, making it slower.  p  pToday someone challenged me on this, and provided a hrefhttpideone.comvaI3vthis code at ideonea, which when I tested, showed the vector to be over twice as fast.  p  pDo the coders of StackOverflow want to enlighten me on this apparent discrepancy    Ive gone over both sets of code, and they seem euqivalent to me, but maybe Im blind from playing with both of them so much.p  pFootnote this is emvery closeem to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8784732one of my previous questionsa, but my code had several bugs which were addressed.  Due to new informationcode, I felt this was different enough to justify a separate question.  If not, Ill work on merging them.p

From the code above i am injecting the session into repository and controlling the transaction via IHttpmodule . Now there are two concerns for me .p  ol lipIf I implement the transaction management via the code above it would be called whenever there is a request and it would open a session for that request . anyhow thats the sole purpose of implementing Session Per Request approach . but what if among all my controller methods I have only one method which actually uses the repository then I dont want to open the session everytime i make a request . Only during the actions which are marked by Transaction attribute in controller would handle the transaction.pli lipI would make a request and session would be opened only when the respository requests for it . so can it be implemented via any IoC container . pli lipI still want the httpcontext events to handle the transaction so that contextBegingRequest and contextEndRequest. and the transaction would be handled inside that httpmodule with the httpcontext on request . But i dont want to implement IhttpModule and put into web.config . Is there any other alternative for this approach pli lipThe session opening and closing would be done solely inside those httpcontext only however I want to manage it via an IoC container preferably ninject but only when the repository is being requesting for that session . Mind it the reopsitory may be intialised when the controller is invoked but that shouldnt open the session inside that repository. session should open when actually repository is performing any transient actions . pli ol  pI might not b good at english if someone can help me with the approach can someone clarify what practise should i follow for this scenario p  pI am using Mvc 3 with ninject and nhibernate p

A sample output is given after the code where the threads dont print all the values from 1 to 100 before deadlock. For deadlock to occur in either thread, the codewhilevictim icode has to run forever.

Negative 1866 pI have been researching this for a few hours and I feel that I cant decide on what is right or wrong. This was asked before on Stackoverflow, but a couple of years ago so I thought I could ask again. I want to include H1 tags on my pages but hide them, because I have graphic in my banner, but I was taught to use an H1 tag for accessibility reasons. p  pI discovered that this can be considered SEO spamming and can get a site blacklisted, I do not want this. It was also discovered that using H1 tags can greatly increase the sites SEO when using relative headers.p  pSo I want to use them and hide them, for two reasons, but avoid Google blacklisting my site, is there a standard accepted method to doing this, or will I need to choose between risking blacklisting and helping those with visual disabilities a better user experiencep  pThanks in advance for any advice.p

Negative 1866 pIm trying to render a html page with an image in it.p  pI am having an issue that current the size of the image seems to be getting doubled, my image is 304x112 and when it renders to pdf it is 607x224.p  pI did find thisp  blockquote   pScreen resolution is typically 96 dpi. So when you view an HTML page   on your monitor, Windows will display it at 96 dpi.p      pThe disparity between the screen resolution and the PDF 72 dpi   resolution means that HTML appears larger in print documents than it   does on screen.p      pYou will need to apply a scale of 7296 0.75 to compensate for this   if you want both to appear the same size.p      pFor example, if you are rendering a web page supplying a value of 800   for the Width parameter, you will need to set the width of your Rect   to 600 if you want both to appear the same size.p blockquote  pandp  blockquote   pPDF documents are predominantly vectorbased. As such, they do not   really have a dpi because they are resolution independent. The only   portions of PDFs which are raster based are images.p      pMost elements of HTML  text, lines  are vector based. So they are   resolutionindependent.p      pThe resolution at which images in your web pages are rendered is   complicated. Suppose you have a 300 square image referenced by an   image tag. If the width of your Doc.Rect is the same as the width you   pass to AddImageUrl, then this will be rendered at 72 dpi. However, by   changing the ratios between these two values, the image will be scaled   and hence the resolution will be changed.p      pAnd... if your 300 square is in an img tag with a width and height of   150, then the default resolution will be doubled.p blockquote  pMy problem seems to be what is described in the second part there.p  pMy end result will be to add the output to a a4 portrait page so it can be printed along with other text in the document but that is working correctly.p  pCurrently when rendering I use thisp  precodedoc.MediaBox.String  pageSize doc.Rect.String  pageSize doc.AddImageHtmlhtml, true, width, disableCache codepre  pwhere page size is A4 and the width is set to 800 in the addimagehtml call.p  pI have tried setting the doc.Rect.Width to 600 after the pagesize is set and also made the width to the addimagehtml call 800 but the image still renders incorrectly.p  pIs there something else Im missingp  pEDIT Html of page to be converted is thisp  precodelthtml xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtml gt     lthead runatservergt         lttitlegtWorkpacklttitlegt          ltstylegt              body  fontfamily Arial, Helvetica, sansserif          ltstylegt     ltheadgt     ltbody styleborder 1px solid blackgt         ltdiv styleheight 1100pxgt             ltdiv styleposition absolute top 50gt                 ltdiv styletextalign center width 780px gt                     ltdivgt                         lt if string.IsNullOrWhiteSpaceModel.CompanyLogogt                             ltimg srclt Url.ToFullyQualifiedUrlModel.CompanyLogo gtgt                             lt  gt                     ltdivgt                     ltdivgt                         lth1gtlt Model.PlantName gtlth1gt                     ltdivgt                     ltdiv stylefontsize 15pt fontweight boldgt                         lth1gtlt Model.WorkpackTitle gt  lt Model.WorkPackNumber gtlth1gt                     ltdivgt                 ltdivgt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt     ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre

Negative 1866 pWe have a .Net application that connects to web services on servers that we host, and we have SSL certificates bound to https443 on those servers.  Sometimes these SSL certificates are selfsigned, so were not relying entirely on the X509Certificate2.Verify method and the SslPolicyErrors.None enum within the method that weve programmed for ServicePointManager.ServerCertificateValidationCallback, because our certs arent always valid.p  pWe have a secondary step that checks the signature of the hash string X509Certificate.GetCertHashString and compares it against a list of approved certificates.  This way we can return a true for the callback if its a known certificate.p  pIn one of our installation sites, were getting a different hash string when connecting to precisely the same web server.  After printing out to a log file every property on the X509Certificate object, I found that the Issued By value is different when they connect.  Something along the way from their users workstations out to their network hardware, and then off to our server, is modifying the certificate.  When our application validates the certificate, first of all its not a trusted authority anymore, and second when it checks the hash string, its not on the approved list changing the issuer seems to change the hash.p  pCan anyone provide any ideas on how theyre doing this  Furthermore, any idea how to do that programmatically in .Netp  pThanks, Danp

A snake cube is a puzzle composed of a chain of cubelets, connected by an elastic band running through each cubelet. Each cubelet can rotate 360 about the elastic band, allowing various structures to be built depending upon the way in which the chain is initially constructed, with the ultimate goal of arranging the cubes in such a way to create a cube.p blockquote  pExamplep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com5VYDt.png altenter image description herep  blockquote   pThis particular arrangement contains 17 groups of cubelets, composed of 8 groups of two cubelets and 9 groups of three cubelets. This arrangement can be expressed in a variety of ways, but for the purposes of this exercise, let 0 denote pieces whose rotation does not change the orientation of the puzzle, or may be considered a straight piece, while 1 will denote pieces whose rotation changes the puzzle configuration, or bend the snake. Using that schema, the snake puzzle above could be described as 001110110111010111101010100.p blockquote  pChallengep  blockquote   pYour challenge is to write a program, in any language of your choosing, that takes the cube dimensions X, Y, Z and a binary string as input, and outputs 1 without quotes if it is possible to solve the puzzle, i.e. construct a proper XYZ cube given the cubelet orientation, and 0 if the current arrangement cannot be solved.p blockquote  pI posted a semidetailed explanation of the a hrefhttpjuantalon.tumblr.compost27619664958solvingsnakecubepuzzles relnofollowsolutiona, but how do I determine if the a hrefhttpsgithub.comjagtalonUdacityblobmastertrialpaysnake.py relnofollowprograma solves the problem I thought about getting more test cases, but I ran into some problemsp  ol liThe snake cube example from TrialPays blog has the same combination as the picture on Wikipedias Snake Cube page and www.mathematischebasteleien.de.li liIts very tedious to manually convert an image into a string.li ol  pI tried to make a program that would churn out a lot of combinationsp  precodeWe should start at the binary representation of 16777216 00100..., because lesser numbers have more than 2 consecutive 0s 000111... i  16777216 solved  [] while i lt 227     s  strbini[2]     Add 0s     if lens lt 27         s  027lens  s     Check if there are more than 2 consecutive 0s     print s     if s.find000  1         if snakecubesolution3, 3, 3, s  1             solved.appends     i  1 codepre  pBut it just takes forever to finish executing.

I guess this is a preauthentication scenario, but I dont have any clue how should I get this to work.p  pThis is my securitycontext.xmlp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingISO88591gt ltbeans

Negative 1866 pI started with requirement of reading and writing files in fromin a directory on a remote Ubuntu machine.p  pFirst, I wrote a Java program that could read,write files from a shared folder on a remote Windows machine i.e on a LAN.

But finally, I want to write a code like the snippet given, irrespective of the machines, network etc.li liThe Jsch solution and the others suggestedusage of http, ftp etc. over URL finally are using some services that are running on the remote machine. In other words, it is NOT THAT Java IO is being used to access the remote file system  this doesnt appeal to me as Im relying on services rather than using goodold IO.li liSamba, SSHFS too popped onto the scene, only to add to my confusion. But I dont see them as the solutions to my objective li ul  pTo reiterate, strongI want to write a code using Java IOeither plain or nio, both are fine which simply can read, write remote files without using services over protocols like ftp, http etc. or socket senderreceiver modelstrong.

Negative 1866 pI am making a small alarm clock application to brush up on Java.

They are always rectangular, not necessarily following the order in which the pixels are calculated lefttoright, but the area does not always stretch to the far side of the subimage.p  pI have verified that immediately after the pixel is drawn with Graphics.drawLine, BufferedImage.getRGB returns the right color for the pixel, but after the calculation is finished, it can return black instead, as the pixel is drawn on the screen.p  pThe problem seems to vanish if I disable multithreaded calculating by assigning only one core to javaw.exe via the task manager but I really dont want to have to abandon multicore calculation. Has anyone else encountered this problem I have not found anything via Google and stackoverflow, and do you know how to fix itp  pThe Graphics.drawLine call is synchronized on the Graphics object if I additionally synchronized it on the BufferedImage, nothing changes.p  pIf you want to see the bug for yourself, you can download the program at a hrefhttpcode.lucaswerkmeister.dejfractalizer relnofollowhttpcode.lucaswerkmeister.dejfractalizera.

Negative 1866 pSo heres a question about scheme variable binds.  Lets say I have the following functionp  precodedefine undefinedTest lambda y list x y codepre  pThis will warn of x being an unbound variable when run in GuileScheme 2.0.3.  If I then execute the following statementp  precodegt let x something undefinedTest else codepre  pI will get an error and the option to debug it.  However if I execute the following statementsp  precodegt define x something gt undefinedTest else codepre  pI get the expected answer of something else.  Why is scheme able to bind x when it is defined at the toplevel, but not when it is bound by let.  Is this because when the function is defined it is also defined at the toplevel, and so when scheme go to search its nearest enclosing environment, the let environment is not actually enclosing as it still starts its search at the toplevel  p

Negative 1866 pFirst of all, I want to say hello to everybody since I am new here and I have found a lot of solutions to my problems in this page. Great job.p  pMy question is about iOS development. I am writing a simple game in order to test the low level Core Graphics functions contexts, layers, etc and how to mix it with actual simple views... I explain it  I have a simple sprite in the screen, it is animated with the codeUIImageViewcode properties, so the frame rate works perfectly. After that, I added an infinite background that is being generated on the fly with  codebezier curvescode. To animate this, I use a codeCADisplayLinkcode, calling a method codeanimatecode on the background, that moves my points on the codebezier curvecode, and then I call codesetNeedsDisplaycode. It works more or less well, but if I remove the background or the codesetNeedsDisplaycode calling, so it does not get regenerated every frame the frame rate increases a lot, so anything is not working correctly in this part... p  pI have also tried a double buffering system, but it works worse than my current code. I though about using a thread too, but I really dont find anything hard for CPU to do on background.p  pHere is the codep  precodeThis is called automatically with CADDisplayLink.  void animateCADisplayLink sender      Check for deleting the first point.     float x  points[firstPoint].x     if  x lt 2DIST           CGFloat lastX  points[lastPoint].x         lastPoint  firstPoint         firstPoint  firstPoint  1  TOTALPOINTS         points[lastPoint]  CGPointMakelastX  DIST, [self getNextY]           Move points     forint i  0 i lt TOTALPOINTS i          points[i].x  7           Mark as needed to redraw     [self setNeedsDisplay]     voiddrawRectCGRectrect          CGContextRef context  UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext      CGContextSetLineWidthcontext, 3.0     CGContextSetRGBStrokeColorcontext, 0, 0, 0, 1.0     CGContextSetRGBFillColorcontext, 1.0, 0, 0, 1.0     CGContextSetLineCapcontext, kCGLineCapRound      Create path     CGMutablePathRef path  CGPathCreateMutable      Draw the curve     [self drawBezierCurveInPathpath]       Close and add path     CGPathAddLineToPointpath, NULL, 485, 5     CGPathAddLineToPointpath, NULL, 5, 5     CGPathCloseSubpathpath      CGContextAddPathcontext, path      CGContextSetFillColorWithColorcontext, bg2          [[UIColor redColor] setFill]     [[UIColor blackColor] setStroke]      CGContextDrawPathcontext, kCGPathFillStroke            Release     CGPathReleasepath        Paint time.     playintIntervalView.text  [NSString stringWithFormatf, playingInterval]    void drawBezierCurveInPath CGMutablePathRef path      CGPoint fp  midPointpoints[firstPoint], points[firstPoint1TOTALPOINTS]     CGPathMoveToPointpath, NULL, fp.x, fp.y       int i  firstPoint     for int k  0 k lt TOTALPOINTS2 k          previousPoint2  points[i]         previousPoint1  points[i1TOTALPOINTS]         currentPoint  points[i2TOTALPOINTS]           calculate mid point         CGPoint mid2  midPointcurrentPoint, previousPoint1          CGPathAddQuadCurveToPointpath, nil, previousPoint1.x, previousPoint1.y, mid2.x, mid2.y           i  i  1  TOTALPOINTS                codepre  pI would prefer to store a codeUIBezierPathcode so I can then make some collision tests but it doesnt allow you to just remove ONE point when it leaves the screen on the left, so I would have to initialize it every frame too...

Negative 1866 pWere updating our architecture to use a single object model for desktop, web and mobile that can be used in the MVVM pattern. I would like to be able to limit the data fields that are serialized through Web API by using interfaces on the controllers. This is required because the model objects for mobile are stored in HTML5 local storage so dont carry optional data while a thin desktop client would be able to store and work with more data.p  pTo achieve this a model will implement the different interfaces that define which data fields should be serialized and there will be a controller specific to the interface.p  pThe problem is that the Web API always serializes every field in the model even if it is not part of the interface being returned. How can we only serialize fields in the returned interfacep

Negative 1866 pIve looked at a lot of articles this afternoon, but I cant seem to find a complete post that deals with complex objects within models that addresses what Im attempting to do.p  pI am using a Code First approach, but do not have my models directly altering my database structure.

To demonstrate it betterp  precode    private interface ShapeFactory         public Shape createint x, int y           private class CircleFactory implements ShapeFactory         public Shape createfloat radius, int x, int y error             return new Circleradius, x,y               codepre  pAny ideas how to overcome this problem I must not recieve an input from user inside the factory must be recieved from outside.p  pThanksp

Negative 1866 pI wrote a function in a .pyfile, in an external editor PyScripter. I loaded it into the IDLEeditor early, and then continued writing the function in PyScripter, occassionally running it in IDLE by using F5 on the loaded .py without reloading it in the IDLE .pyeditor.p  pNow then, to the problem. I was done with the .py, saved it one last time in PyScripter and ran it in IDLE. Found that I had to do one last tweak. Accidently did the tweak in the IDLEeditor, which had the old  version, saved it. PyScripter still running. Reloads the file when it notices it has changed on disk. All data gone.p  pI realized the mistake without reloading the saved .py in IDLE though, so the function is still available in memory.

Negative 1866 pIve noticed something odd about Skype on the iPad. It keeps sending me notifications with the contents of what people have sent to me as text even after Ive closed the app. For the first ten minutes it makes sense as thats how long something can keep running in the background after you close an app. These are local notifications. However beyond that it should simply not be possible. Skype has claimed for ages that their connections are end to end encrypted. For them to keep sending these notifications after ten minutes means that they are sending them via Apples push notification service. Which means that somehow they are decrypting messages I receive on their servers and sending them to my device via Apple. This seems like either clear evidence of there being no end to end encryption or that they have a deal with Apple allowing them to keep running for more than ten minutes. If its the latter, is there some way to do this in my own appp
Negative 1866 pI have a child class that starts a method of the base class as a thread. The child class has also implemented a pure virtual method from the base class. The thread then needs to call the childs implemented version of the pure virtual method in the thread, but the thread throws an exception Pure virtual method called. The code below demonstrates what happens on construction of a Childp  precodeclass Base    stdthread messageThread    virtual void processMessagestdstring msg  0    static void checkForMessagesBase c      whiletrue        stdstring msg  Hello       cgtprocessMessagemsg           class Child  public Base    Child      messageThread  stdthreadcheckForMessages, this       void processMessagestdstring msg       stdcout ltlt Message  ltlt msg ltlt stdendl     codepre  pMy understanding is that Child is still considered a Base until after the constructor finishes, so the thread is only able to see processMessage as a pure virtual function.

Negative 1866 pI have an app where you can rotate images around by twisting with your fingers and you can move the app by dragging it. You can also stretch and squeeze the image. I have had much problems with memory overloads and have solved them to a certain degree. When the image is at a right angle I can import the image cropped to where the only part that gets imported is the part that shows in the image view so the rest doesnt take up memory. I do this by having it start at a certain x and y and only have it import to a certain height and width. This works just fine. I am using a matrix to size, and rotate the image. The issue is when it is rotated to other degrees it becomes much more complicated. The only way I have been able to do things like this is with much trig and it is very hard to get it to not cut off wrong things inside the image view. Is there any easier way to do this Is there something that will crop it at certain parts after it is rotated instead of before I am just looking for some help on this, if more information will help somebody help me I will be glad to give more information, just not sure what part of my code will be helpful with this question. Any help would be appreciated, Thanks.p

Negative 1866 pI would like to implement a PDFViewer which shows two pages of the document side by side at a time. Naturally, the document should show the cover page alone if it exists such that those pages belonging together are shown simultaneously. The problem is that some documents have a cover page as a first page and some seem to have the front cover and then the back cover as the first pages and some have neither.p  pMy question is How do I know if there is one or more cover pages or not Do cover pages carry a special marking that can be recognised Or is this maybe a matter of examining page numbersp  pThanks for your timep

Negative 1866 pIve got a class derived from a set containing pointers to another class objects. Basically it looks like thisp  precodeclass connectionSLOT private stdsetltconnectionSLOTgt  ...  codepre  pIts very simple and works fine to represent directed graphs, perhaps. My class also contains some simple methods like connect, disconnect, and so on, all of them expect object pointers as argument and also return with such a pointers. i.e. their declarations differ only in their names For instancep  precodeconnectionSLOT connectionSLOTconnectconnectionSLOT A    insert A return A  codepre  pOrp  precodeconnectionSLOT connectionSLOTdisconnectconnectionSLOT A    eraseA return this  codepre  pSo, my issue is how can I make a new method which applied these functions not on the object itself but all the objects contained in the set ie contained in the calling object p  pI  would like to have something like thisp  precodeconnectionSLOT newmethod passing a method and its argument      foritbeginitendit execute the method on it    return something   codepre  pIt would be applied for connecting all the neighbor points to a certain vertex, perhaps.

Negative 1866 pI have a narrow codeUITextViewcode about 1 line in height to which I only add text programmatically, setting the codetextcode property of it as I click buttons. I also handle the cursor position manually, setting the codeselectedRangecode as the text changes. All works great as long as I have only one line of text.p  pWhen I have two or more lines of text and try to insert text at the first line, the text is inserted correctly and the cursor position is still at the right place but the codeUITextViewcode scrolls to the bottom. When I then add another piece of text at the top it scrolls up to the correct position. This pattern then repeats for every entered piece of text at a line other than the last, making the UITextView scroll up and down for every button pressed.p  pI also tried calling codeUITextView scrollRangeToVisiblecode passing the selectedRange property as argument after setting the new text. That didnt work either.p  pI finally tried setting codeselectedRangecode after a 0.5 s delay after I set the codetextcode. Then it works as it should, but only after the codeUITextViewcode has first been scrolled down to the bottom for 0.5 s. This seems to indicate that the codesetTextcode method of UITextView is asynchronous in some way, and completes after I have already set codeselectedRangecode or called codescrollRangeToVisiblecode, and readjusts the UITextView to what it believes is the desired.p  pCan anyone tell me what is going on, and how I can get around the problem.p  pThanksp

A FastCGI server, may hold a context which may be big and costly to share between processes which is global to all request handlers when it is designed as a multithreaded server. Forking a new process for each concurrent request does not allow to ensure a common context anymore.p  h1The questionh1  pAre the two above quotations still true one is dated 2011, the other 2010 I searched the web on the topic, but could not find anything relevant. If its still true, then, will it always be true or is there an expected plan for codemodfcgidcode, to be aware of multithreaded FastCGI servers and accept these may be designed to handle multiple concurrent requestsp

The output should simply be the sum of the two floatsp  pI believe that the problem lies within the normalizing.p  precode.data askusera     .asciiz Enter a decimal number a  askuserb     .asciiz Enter a decimal number b  sum            .asciiz ab   erroroutofrange .asciiz Error A number you entered is out of range  newline       .asciiz n   .text main Ask user for the input a la a0, askusera       load the addr of askusera into a0. li v0, 4            4 is the printstring syscall. syscall              do the syscall.  put input a into s0 li v0, 6           6 for getting floating point numbers syscall              do the syscall mfc1  s0, f0          move floating point number to s0   ask user for the input b la a0, askuserb       load the addr of askuserb into a0. li v0, 4            4 is the printstring syscall. syscall              do the syscall.  put input b into s1 li v0, 6           6 for getting floating point numbers syscall              do the syscall mfc1  s1, f0          move floating point number to s1  extract parts for A srl t0, s0, 31        t0  Sign Bit A sll t1, s0, 1 srl t1, t1, 24         sub t1, t1, 127       t1  Exponent Bit A     sll t2, s0, 9 srl t2, t2, 9         t2  Mantissa A srl t2, t2, 13        Truncate Mantissa ori t2, t2, 0x800000 srl t2, t2, 12  extract parts for B srl t5, s1, 31        t5  Sign Bit B sll t6, s1, 1 srl t6, t6, 24         sub t6, t6, 127       t6  Exponent Bit B sll t7, s1, 9 srl t7, t7, 9         t7  Mantissa B srl t7, t7, 13        Truncate Mantissa ori t7, t7, 0x800000 srl t7, t7, 12  Check that exponent A is gt16 and lt16, jump to error otherwise blt t1, 16, oorerror bgt t1, 16, oorerror  Check that exponent B is gt16 and lt16, jump to error otherwise blt t6, 16, oorerror bgt t6, 16, oorerror  j nooorerror  Throw error oorerror   la a0, erroroutofrange   load the addr of askusera into a0. li v0, 4            4 is the printstring syscall. syscall              do the syscall. j exit        There was no out of range error nooorerror  compare exponents beq t6, t1, exponentsmatch bgt t6, t1 expBgtexpA sub t8, t6, t1 srlv t7, t7, t8 move t6, t1 j exponentsmatch expBgtexpA sub t8, t1, t6 srlv t2, t2, t8 move t1, t6  exponentsmatch If the signs are the same, add mants If the signs are diff, subtract mants bne t0, t5, differentsigns add t9, t2, t7 j significandsadded differentsigns sub t9, t2, t7   significandsadded normalize  determine size bne t0, t5, normalizedifferentsign  normalizesamesign andi t8, t9, 0x1000 beq t8, zero, donenormalize srl t9, t9, 1 addi t1, t1, 1 j normalizesamesign  normalizedifferentsign andi t8, t9, 0x1000 beq t8, zero, donenormalize sll t9, t9, 1 subi t1, t1, 1 j normalizedifferentsign  donenormalize  Check for overflow  Convert back to float sll t0, t0, 31        move sign to 32nd bit addi t1, t1, 127      Add bias sll t1, t1, 23        move exponent to bits 2431 sll t9, t9, 11        move over mant andi t9, t9, 0x3FFFFF sll t9, t9, 1   or s2, t0, t1 or s2, s2, t9  Print the float mtc1 s2, f12 li  v0,    2    syscall  exit Exit Program li v0, 10           syscall code 10 is for exit. syscall              make the syscall. codepre

Negative 1866 pI have implemented a custom scroll view not list view. Its using Intent Service to hit the server with offset and limit and display the result. For instance. i set offset  0 and limit  FIRSTBATCH int FIRSTBATCH  15 for the first call. Its returning 15 names and details. And the next intent service call. I am using offset  FIRSTBATCH and limit  FIRSTBATCH. Its retuning next 15 names, from 15 to 30. And i am displaying Load More button at the end of 30 names. Here is my problem. Once i hit Load More button, i want to display the next 15 names, with offset  FIRSTBATCH  FIRSTBATCH and limit  FIRSTBATCH. And it will be growing more ..... Here is my implementation ....p  precodeprivate void startName  Intent getNameSearch  new IntentgetSherlockActivity, IntentService.class     getNameSearch.putExtrasearchoffset, 0     getNameSearch.putExtrasearchlimit, FIRSTBATCH     getNameSearch.setActionIntentService.ACTIONGETNAMESEARCH     getSherlockActivity.startServicegetNameSearch     mCallback.onCreateProgressDialog      getNameSearch  new IntentgetSherlockActivity, IntentService.class     getNameSearch.putExtrasearchoffset, FIRSTBATCH     getNameSearch.putExtrasearchlimit, FIRSTBATCH     getNameSearch.setActionIntentService.ACTIONGETNAMESEARCH     getSherlockActivity.startServicegetNameSearch     mCallback.onCreateProgressDialog  codepre  pOnce the view is displayed. I am loading the LoadMore Button. And once i click the LoadMore button i am calling the intent service again. But i know this is wrong. As the offset will be always 30 everytime. So the name will be displayed from 30 to 45 all the time. I want this to grow. Say, after i click LoadMore button. I want this to be 30 to 45 and Again hit the load More button, it should be 45 to 60 and goes on ... p  precode    final Button btnAddMore  Button myNameSearch.findViewByIdR.id.loadMore     btnAddMore.setVisibilityView.VISIBLE     loadMoreButton  false     btnAddMore.setOnClickListenernew OnClickListener          Override         public void onClickView v              loadMoreButton               codepre  pAnd here is the loadMoreSpinner methodp  precodeprivate void loadMoreButton      Intent getNameSearch  new IntentgetSherlockActivity, IntentService.class     int finalOffset  FIRSTBATCH  2     getNameSearch.putExtrasearchoffset, finalOffset     getNameSearch.putExtrasearchlimit, FIRSTBATCH     getNameSearch.setActionIntentService.ACTIONGETNAMESEARCH     getSherlockActivity.startServicegetNameSearch     mCallback.onCreateProgressDialog  codepre

Negative 1866 pAs a developer, Im trying to make my classes more modular and reusable.  One of the areas where Ive run into problems is when I design a class to work with entity framework entities.p  pFor example, I might create a shopping cart class, whos role is to act as a container for products, discounts, and other things related to checkout.  It exposes methods to get the cart total, and enforce some business rules related to what a cart can and cant do.p  pI might create and entityframework entity thats a Product and make my shopping cart accept this entity.  However convenient this seems, it creates an unwanted dependency on the Product class in the project that Im using the shopping cart in.  If I wanted to reuse that shopping cart into another project, the Product entity wouldnt necessarily be the same.p  pHow can I elegantly decouple my shopping cart class from entity framework in a way that isnt going to cause architectural problems down the roadp  pIve thought of creating an interface IProduct that has the related properties and methods that the shopping card would need and then make my entity class an instance of IProduct.p  pBasically, Im looking for a good design pattern to decouple my classes from a projects local domain entities, whatever form they might take..p  pstrongHeres what I ended up going with a generic shopping cart where T is IProduct.

Negative 1866 pIve searched for a while about JS testing frameworks and came across a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions300855lookingforabetterjavascriptunittesttoolthis posta. The mentioned testing frameworks are QUnit, Jasmine, Karma, JSTestDriver, YUI, TestSwarm, and JSUnit as well as Mocha. I havent worked at all with any of these and based on their brief descriptions, Im not sure which is best for my purpose.p  pWhat Im looking to do is not as granular as unit testing but its not as high as acceptance testing either. If anything Id lean towards unit testing but as I said, its not quite that. So from the mentioned frameworks and others which you know of, are there any frameworks that at least somewhat cover this approachp  pIm using AngularJS and I know that Karma is strongly associated with it but Id like to know more about other testing frameworks.p

Negative 1866 pSo, I have a piece of code using WeakReferences. I know of the common code.IsAlivecode race condition, so I didnt use that. I basically have something like thisp  precodeWeakReference lastStringnew WeakReferencenull public override string ToString    iflastStringnull        var slastString.Target as string error here     ifsnull            return s           var strbase.ToString   lastStringnew WeakReferencestr   return str  codepre  pSomehow, Im getting a null reference exception at the marked line. By debugging it, I can confirm that lastString is indeed null, despite being wrapped in a null check and lastString never actually being set to null. p  pThis only happens in a complex flow as well, which makes me think garbage collection is somehow taking my actual WeakReference object, and not just its target. p  pCan someone enlighten me as to how this is happening and what the best course of action is p  pEDIT I cant determine at all the cause of this. I ended up wrapping the error code in a trycatch just fix it for now. Im very interested in the root cause of this though. Ive been trying to reproduce this in a simple test case, but its proven very difficult to do. Also, this only appears to happen when running under a unit test runner. If I take the code and trim it down to the minimum, it will continue to crash when running using TestDriven and Gallio, but will not fail when put into a console applicationp

Here are my thoughtsp  h31. Balancing using source IPh3  pCaching the tokens on one server and balancing by IP would be ideal, however, the IP can not assumed to be static. So when the same user tries to access services that require authorization from another IP with a valid token, it will fail, because it is not cached on this machine. Also other devices logged in with this user will not reach the same machine.p  h32. Balancing using a load balancing cookieh3  pAlso not really an option, since it cannot be assumed that every client implements cookie storage.p  h33. Balancing using the codeAuthorizationcode headerh3  pBalancing by hashing the codeAuthorization Bearercode token header is problematic, because the first request for requesting the authorization token has no codeAuthorizationcode header, thus, the following request might not hit the same instance.p  pMy current approach is to use a central Redis instance for authorization token storage. Is there an option left, where a centralized approach can be avoidedp

The app delegate simply asks the topmost view controller to do this job.p  pIs this properp

Negative 1866 pIm trying to make a copy of the resizing algorithm of OpenCV with bilinear interpolation in C. What I want to achieve is that the resulting image is exactly the same pixel value to that produced by OpenCV. I am particularly interested in shrinking and not in the magnification, and Im interested to use it on single channel Grayscale images. On the net I read that the bilinear interpolation algorithm is different between shrinkings and enlargements, but I did not find formulas for shrinkingimplementations, so it is likely that the code I wrote is totally wrong. What I wrote comes from my knowledge of interpolation acquired in a university course in Computer Graphics and OpenGL. The result of the algorithm that I wrote are images visually identical to those produced by OpenCV but whose pixel values are not perfectly identical in particular near edges. Can you show me the shrinking algorithm with bilinear interpolation and a possible implementationp  pNote The code attached is as a onedimensional filter which must be applied first horizontally and then vertically i.e. with transposed matrix.p  precodeMat rescaleMat src, float ratio      float width  src.cols  ratio resized width     int iwidth  cvRoundwidth     float step  floatsrc.cols  floatiwidth size of new pixels mapped over old image     float center  step  2 V1  center position of new pixel     float center  step  src.cols V2  other possible center position of new pixel     float center  0.099f V3  Lena 512x512 lower difference possible to OpenCV      Mat dstsrc.rows, iwidth, CV8UC1      cycle through all rows     forint j  0 j lt src.rows j         in each row compute new pixels         forint i  0 i lt iwidth i             float pos  istep  center position of the center of new pixel in old map coordinates             int pred  floorpos predecessor pixel in the original image             int succ  ceilpos successor pixel in the original image             float dpred  pos  pred pred and succ distances from the center of new pixel             float dsucc  succ  pos             int valpred  src.atltuchargtj, pred pred and succ values             int valsucc  src.atltuchargtj, succ              float val  valpred  dsucc  valsucc  dpred inverting dsucc and dpred, supposing dsucc  1  dpred...             int ival  cvRoundval             ifival  0 if pos is a perfect int x.0000, pred and succ are the same pixel                 ival  valpred             dst.atltuchargtj, i  ival                    return dst  codepre

Negative 1866 pIm building a browser extension script that highlights keywords on a page, and when the user hovers over them  creates a tooltip which is filled using AJAX and PHP. I use a series of javascript libraries  jquery, highlight library, tooltip library, and a file containing an array. The AJAX sends an id number to the PHP, which retrieves API data off another server, which the PHP echoes into the tooltip.p  pAs of now, the PHP file used is being hosted on my websites server inMotion hosting. For certain keywords the user hovers over, it takes a long time to load the PHP 10 seconds, for others its fast less than 1 second. My question  is this under my control, or does this lie with the APIs server Are there any steps I can take to hopefully improve the loading speedsp
Negative 1866 pIm working on a site herep  pa hrefhttpwww.jasnasyogaonline.commembershiptest.php relnofollowhttpwww.jasnasyogaonline.commembershiptest.phpap  pAnd if you hover over the right nav, youll see a fade in effect that happens where the background animates to the top and bottom from the middle of the link. In between the three colored lines the border of the right nav youll see that there is white color. This is because on the other pages of the site, the background is white and the original programmer just used a background image to create the diagonal edge of the nav item. Now that there is a full page videoimage, this doesnt work because the background isnt white and the effect is lost.p  pMy client is now looking to just have it be transparent between the razor lines but keep the nav items with the diagonal edges. If I removed the images on the end of the nav item, they just become straight rectangles. Ive tried some CSS with bordersborderwidths, etc. but its a little tricky because if you look at the source code, the background is being generated by a PHP file thats using imagecreatetruecolor to create the hover effect.p  pAny ideas on how to cut the corner off of the right nav while keep the area between the razor lines transparent Im beginning to run out of ideas.

Negative 1866 pI have a large dataset that I need to output in a table for study reasons, I work on a local server. I first wrote this codep  precodemysqliquerycon,SELECT xxx, yyy, zzz FROM table1 ORDER BY xxx ASC LIMIT 0, 100 codepre  pwhich is ok, it takes one instant to output the values. The problem is i need to join table1 to another table of the same database, so I do thisp  precodemysqliquerycon,SELECT xxx, yyy, zzz FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.yyytable2.yyy ORDER BY xxx ASC LIMIT 0, 100 codepre  pand the query stucks forever.p  pIs there some coding error I think no, because I did the same query on a smaller database with the same table structure and it worked.p  pSo, I guess the problem is that when I perform the join all the values from table2 are called and my poor local server doesnt manage to finish the query also, I notice a huge amount of disk space is used, when second query is performed, an I talk about several GB of space. Is there some way to select only few records from table 2, as I did for table 1 I mean something like codeSELECT xxx, yyy, zzz FROM table1code and also codeSELECT yyy, www, aaa FROM table2code and join just these values.p  pThanks everyonep
Negative 1866 pI had to refactor a web page when I added an image upload form nested within the main form as this is not possible. The outer form was converted into elements with an item class and onClick of the submit button I serialised these using a selectorp  precodeform  .item.serialize codepre  pHowever Im now refactoring again to use the jquery validate plugin and Im wondering if Im able to use this selector rather than the form itself which is nolonger there in some way.p  pI was thinking something likep  precode.item.validate     rules           summary                validateSummary true               ..........etc etc codepre  pthis doesnt seem to work but the theory was Id serialize the matching .item elements and then apply custom validation to the elements in this list that matched the name in the same way I assumed that a form serialization would work.p  pIve seen the classRules option that comes with the validate plugin however it looks like this groups custom validations by class, in fact I want to do normal form validation only for this I use a selector instead of the form.p

Negative 1866 pI have two activities. One is main activity one add button and one listview, the other one has edittext for task name, datepicker for date, spinner for priority of task. When  start this app it shows add button, when  click this button it shows edittext, datepicker and spinner, when  fill these fields and click ok button it adds this on mainactivitys listview. My code provides to add new items to listview but i confused on how to edit these items. When i click on one of the items in listview  want to create new edit activity this activity must also has an edittext, spinner, datepicker with the its entered values from the user. and this activity updatesedits the items of the mainactivitys listview. In my code, when i click an item in the listview, i get an error like this p  pLogCatp  precode1111 164738.311 EAndroidRuntime1015 FATAL EXCEPTION main 1111 164738.311 EAndroidRuntime1015

Negative 1866 pI have a embarrassingly parallel algorithm thatll run within a Parallel.ForEach block on my 4core machine in about 5 minutes. When I run the same on an 8cores machine it ran for much longer I gave up after 10 minutes, so I dont know exactly how long. Since .NET uses a SharedMemory architecture for this kind of thing, Im guessing that access to main memory is creating a bottleneck.p  pSo my question is, is there a way of making ncopies where n is the number of available cores of my data and assigning one copy to each core, thus removing the bottleneck p  pWhat I soxymoronicallys basically want to do is something like distributed memory, but within the same machine.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pI reran the code on the 8core machine and while on my 4core the CPU usage via Task Manager will max out for the duration of the run, on the 8core machine the CPU usage ran at about 5060 for the duration. I wonder if this is indicative of somethingp  pstrongUPDATE 2strong Implemented MPI.NET in my program and I now get 100 CPU usage on all cores, plus I can access cores on other machines.p

Negative 1866 pIm attempting to run a simple encryptiondecryption Android app and testing it in Java as well. Ive searched and havent found an answer thats related to my problem. p  pEssentially, the encrypting and decrypting is working for the most part, except the text after decryption in Java and Android are both slightly different than the original text that became encrypted.

Negative 1866 pI dont know if I worded that correctly and I am not sure if it is even a TSP problem but here is the scenario.p  pI am designing and trying to optimize a route planner for a delivery service. I have multiple drivers salesmen who are all picking up packages at a central depot origin and delivering them on their way home. Their home locations endpoints are known and all the delivery destinations vertices on the map are also known. After finishing the deliveries, the drivers go home instead of coming back to the depot.p  pWhat kind of problem is this and what sort of solutions should I be looking into I have been treating it as a multiTSP without return but still cant determine any near optimum tours. I have also tried shortest length Hamiltonian path but im quickly running into a bloc once i introduce a second driver. p  pAny resources, algorithms and heuristics suggestions are also welcome.p

Negative 1866 pI am using Ci Doctrine here...p  pI have 3 tables named codeexchangeratecode, codeexchangeratebatchcode and codeagentscode.p  pcodeexchangeratecode and codeexchangeratebatchcode have many to one relationship and the agents have many to one relationship with codeexchangeratebatchcode.p  pWhile updating exchangerate table, the updated rates of different countries are added as new rates together with the old rate and a new exchangeratebatch is created and linked with the exchange rate.p  pThe agent table consists of mainagents and subagents on the same table where they are related as one to many but on the same table.p  pI do not have any problem inserting and generating new batch ids. The real problem starts when i have to update the new created id of exchangeratebatch table on each agents and subagents on my agent table. The exchange rate is different for different agent. I need to search all the sub agents of the particular agents and update the exchangeratebatch id.p  pOne solution would be to run the insert of the exchange rate and batch and redirect to the same page while running the update of agents on the background so that the user dont have to wait for the process to continue.p  pHow can we do that. I have hear shellexec can do it but not sure how to use it. Any idea on PHP how to use background process so that i could update the agent table in the background.p  pSorry for the trouble,,p

First result was to be expected C and Python show the same performance, as they call the same C or C routines in the backend.p  pSecond result is that none of the libraries made a big difference. In numbers 22500 rectangles 150150 needed approximately a second to update. As there will be constant upadating due to a new data, i.e. more rectangles, and b user interaction, i.e. zooming, panning etc., a second is way to longp  pWhat would be a faster way.

Past results are                 not indicative of future returns and financial instruments can go down as well as up                 resulting                 in you receiving less than you invested. Do not assume that any recommendations, insights,                 charts, theories, or philosophies will ensure profitable investment. Spread betting, trading                 binary options and CFDs carry a high risk to your capital, can be very volatile and prices                 may                 move rapidly against you.

Negative 1866 pHoping someone can help me with this one because Im stumped.  First of all, I am using MS VS 2010, c .net.  I have two buttons, both which are calling a JQuery function and using .toggleclass to change the background based on .css properties.  If I create both buttons in the same location of my webpage, they both work.  However, if I move the button into a different design element lets say a different table cell, the original first button continues to call the function whereas the other no longer does.  p  pI have tried to recreate problem on JSFiddle, but no luck.  I do notice that the second button still picks up the class on page load though, because the background image is set to what it is supposed to be.  Other than that it doesnt want to run the function.p  pHere is the code for what Im trying to do...p  pHTML  This works....p  precode lttd style77gt ltbutton idbutton1 datainfot1 gtltbuttongt ltbutton idbutton2 datainfot2 gtltbuttongt lttdgt codepre  pHTML  This doesnt workp  precodelttd style77gt ltbutton idbutton1 datainfot1 gtltbuttongt lttdgt lttd style77gt ltbutton idbutton2 datainfot2 gtltbuttongt lttdgt codepre  pemstrongemememstrong   the rest of the code  strongememememememstrongp  pJQueryp  precodebutton.clickfunction                                  this.toggleClasson   codepre  pCSSp  precodebutton      backgroundimage urlimage path  button.on      backgroundimage urlalternateImage path  codepre  pThanks in advance for any help.p

Negative 1866 pI have a grid environment which contains in each cell a static agent. When my agent enters a cell, the static agent in this cell might take points away from me, give me points, or do nothing. My agent can not observe adjacent cells until it moves into one them, it can only move up, down, left or right.p  pThis agent can not learn whilst it is exploring. It enters the grid from a particular corner, and may only leave from that corner. If the agent manages to successfully explore the environment and return back to the corner with positive health, emthenem it can learn from its collected experience, which includes the row, column positions it visited, and the properties of the static agents located in those positions. If the agents health drops to zero whilst exploring, game over. But I can restart the exploration as many times as I want.p  pEach static agent has one of three shapes, one of three colours, and one of two sizes. It also has an associated reward, indicating how many points it addsremoves from me.p  pEach move in this environment costs me one point. I want to design an agent that correctly recognises the reward associated with each type of static agent in this grid.p  pPlease may someone recommend a learning andor evolutionary approach to solving this problem Im stuck at the moment because of the restriction that agent may not observe adjacent squares. Im not sure how I can learn anything from this testing environment from the row, column and static agent properties encountered alone.p

Negative 1866 pI cant figure out whats wrong with my code here. I am trying to have the user think of a number between 1 and 100 and then this program will be able to guess it. The program adds the high and low numbers of the range and divides by two and uses that as the guess. The user enters a 1 if the number the program guess is higher than their number, 1 if it is lower, and 0 if the guess is correct. After at most 7 guesses the number guessed should be right. When I run my code it constantly prints out the guess as 50 and never changes. It seems to never be running through the if statements. It should be running through the program and finding a new guess.p  precodedef main     import random     printGuessing Game     print     printThink of a number 1 and 100 inclusive.nAnd I will guess what it is in 7 tries or less.     print     ready  inputAre you ready yn      print     if ready  y and ready  n         ready  inputAre you ready yn      if ready  n         printBye     if ready  y         lo  0         hi  100         guesshigh  1         guesssame  0         guesslow  1           a  random.randint1,100         numlist  []         for i in range1,100             numlist.appendi         while lo lt hi             guesscount  0             for guesscount in range1,8                 guesscount  1                 guess  lo  hi  2                 printGuess,guesscount,  The number you thought was,guess                 userresponse  inputEnter 1 if my guess was high, 1 if low, and 0 if correct                  if userresponse  1                     hi  guess  1                     guesscount  1                     guess  lo  hi  2                 elif userresponse  1                     lo  guess  1                     guesscount  1                     guess  lo  hi  2                 elif userresponse  0                     printThank you for playing the Guessing Game. main   codepre

Negative 1866 pI am creating multiple rather lengthy forms that will be used as checklists for an evaluation. Because of the length, I would like to maintain the user interface for creating the forms visually as opposed to writing them. p  pWhat I would like to do is insert a piece of code at specific points throughout the forms to include a file uploader. My thought was to place a text field when creating a form in the editor with a specific phase such as fileupload. This script could then search and replace these fields with the file uploader code when the form is opened. p  pDoes this sound possible Others have successfully developed the code to upload a file but only used it in a simple written form. The forms I am creating are much to lengthy to take that approach and I feel the editor simplifies the creation process.p  pThanksp

So I want to be sure there is no leaking or things like that. To be clear, not really in Application context, but a custom controller that is launched from app context and manages all background stuff like robospice requests or location stuff. I am trying to emulate MVC pattern where all the logic is really independent from activities and fragments which have only Subscribe methods for changing the UI. p  pEDIT Actually, if I call this from application context then its different case than Activity or Fragment.

Negative 1866 pIm asking this question in order to share a solution code.p  pstrongContextstrong Apple introduced the AppReceipt in iOS 7. It is also present for OS X IAP. This receipt is a PKCS7 container asn.1 with a payload which is also asn.1 structured. Documentation from Apple instructs how to control the validity of the receipt ondevice and to parse it to check that is has been issued for the current device. There are also instructions to validate the receipt through an application server by contacting Apple server. In that latter case though, the returned json data from Apple does not include information identifying the originating device. Previous IAP protocol model with transactionReceipt included the identifierForVendor UID in the json. p  pstrongQuestionstrong How to parse the binary receipt on a server, using PHP, to check the UID hash, to ensure this receipt belongs to this device This may be done before or after sending the receipt to Apple server.p

Negative 1866 pI am working on RRT path finding system. Basically, it generates random points to find a path. I finished it successfully but am faced with a serious problem. While generating these points I am using a codewhilecode statement and it takes around 10,000  15,000 loop iterations. As you might guess, it freezes the game for 12 sec. I thought to use codeyieldcode for my codewhilecode statement but if I am right, when I use that, my codewhilecode loop will work one time per frame. Then if I have 60 fps, it will take 250 seconds to finish this codewhilecode loop. This is impossible to ignore. So my question is how can I finish this while loop without any game freezesp

Negative 1866 pI have a C project that has a ListBox as part of its user interface. This ListBox is used to display a number of project names. I also have options that will change the size of this ListBox based on queries to a database all projects, incomplete, complete, so on.p  pI also have a label that will display the number of results that are inside the ListBox. I was hoping to find a way to do this automatically each time the list changes, rather than at each line of code where I change the list.p  pI have tried using the DataSourceChanged event, but this poses a really interesting problem. The event is fired BEFORE the ListBox is actually populated with the new values. For example, at the beginning of the program I set the ListBoxs data source to a group of 100 projects. Then, the DataSourceChanged event is fired, and I call codelistBox1.Items.Count.ToStringcode to get the value, and it returns 0. Again, because the list box hasnt been populated. So I will have a label displaying 0 and a list box of 100 items.p  pNow, if I were to narrow this down to incomplete projects which, for example, will have a count of 50, when the event is fired it will return a value of 100. This is because the incomplete projects havent yet been populated since the datasource changed. So, I will have a label that says 100 but a list box of only 50 items.p  pIs there another event I can use Does the DataSourceChanged event have any parameters that I can view the pending data source to get a count Or should I really find every instance in my code that changes the listbox and update the label there.p

Negative 1866 pApples GCD documentation states the followingp  blockquote   pGCD provides and manages FIFO queues to which your application can   submit tasks in the form of block objects. Blocks submitted to   dispatch queues are executed on a pool of threads fully managed by the   system. No guarantee is made as to the thread on which a task   executes. GCD offers three kinds of queuesp blockquote  pDoes this mean that even if I issue a request such as p  precodedispatchsyncdispatchgetglobalqueueDISPATCHQUEUEPRIORITYHIGH, 0, ... codepre  pit could result in the block of code to be executed on the main thread In that case, it seems that calling dispatchsync with a concurrent queue on main thread can result in a deadlock situation in which the main thread is stuck waiting for itself.p  pIs my interpretation of the GCD documentation correctp

Negative 1866 pWe are using SVN on a remote server that I dont have access to.  We use TortoiseSVN and AnkhSVN to check in and out for repositories.  I use SubversionEdge to log in and manage users.

Negative 1866 pI have a question about how to best handle a table that would be shared among multiple relationships, but shouldnt really be joined with all these tables.  For example, suppose I have a table that has US States in it.  Then, in this example, I have maybe three or four other tables that have a relationship with the States table, like  a Users table where the user is from, a Car registration table, an Email table maybe on this system we track sent and received emails and where they originate from and some other table.  If I joined all of these tables to the State table, it kind of makes it look like all of these table should have some sort of relationship with oneanother.  Maybe this is so for a few tables Like User and Car registration but not necessarily between all the tables User and Email table for example.  Or another example might be that we have two tables, Employees and WorkOffice.  Each has there own state.  And each is joined to oneanother, creating a loop WorkOffice has many Employees.  Employee belongs to State and WorkOffice belongs to State.  Now we have a loop.  p  pSo, is it better to have multiple State tables  It doesnt seem like it would be.  But at the same time, I dont want to create relationships that might not really exist  Or is it better to just have the tables but not actually create any sort of relationshipp  pThanks jasonp

Negative 1866 pIts useful to have a hrefhttpgulpjs.com relnofollowgulpa building files using a codewatchcode task. In my case I have a task which watches a codephpcode directory for changes and lintscopies on change, a JS directory which concatenates and copies, and SASS which compiles to CSS on change.p  pIf I checkout another git branch with the watch task running it quite expectedly goes insane, as literally hundreds of files change. One problem which could be solvable is that the codewatchcode triggers generic tasks  the PHP one for example simply relints and copies all PHP files, not just the one that changed. So if 50 files change, the whole stack is relinted 50 times. Ditto for JS because of dependencies and SASS because it runs compass, which then also sees every file as changed.p  pSo at present my solution is to kill my codewatchcode task which is running using a hrefhttpsgithub.comNicoSantangelosublimegulp relnofollowSublime Gulpa, then checkout a new branch, then rerun it. Id imagine that any solution would either need to modify the codeSublime Gulpcode plugin, or stop me using it  which would be fine if there was a quick shortcut to have the codewatchcode task run in the background of my terminal, and allow me to see output but not have it forced on me.p  pI know that git has hooks, and so Im imagining another solution may be to have a checkout hook produce a file which could act as a temporary strongstopstrong sign to the watch task, or something similar.p  pAnyone experienced a similar issue using codewatchcode and how would you suggest solving itp

Negative 1866 pIm stuck with relatively simple sorting problem. I have to write a method codesortpointsPoint[] pointscode that sorts a codePointcode array based only the codePointcodes codexcode coordinates and it is known that their codexcode coordinates can only be either code1code or code2code.

Negative 1866 pI am running an Openfire server on a AWS EC2 instance and am able to connect to the server from my mobile devices and send messages back and forth. Of course, since XMPP is a clientserver based protocol, I incur costs for running this traffic over the AWS server. However, for most use cases, this cost is not very high at all, as normal XMPP stanzas rarely seem to go above ca. 1 KB, so from this end all is ok.p  pI would now, however, like to include the ability to send images from one client to another. One way would be to use an HTTP server, to which user A uploads the picture and then sends the URL of the image to user B via XMPP, so that the user can now get the image via HTTP. There are also several other methods for sending images via XMPP. However, I am interested in doing this via Jingle. p  pAs far as as I understand, Jingle is an out of band peertopeer extension to XMPP. My simple question is, since Jingle communicates peertopeer, i.e. without the use of a server, for the multimedia aspect of the session, will I even incur any data cost on AWS for transferring multimedia from one client to another using Jingle Or put differently, if Jingle is peertopeer, does any data go via my AWS server using Jingle except the session initiate, ack, session terminate stanzas If not, what kind of route does this data take, and how can anyone be billed for this traffic cost, if it is peertopeerp

Negative 1866 pI have a a hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenUSdocsWebAPIWebWorkersAPIbasicusage relnofollowWeb Workera. I wish to make periodic network requests with it. One thing I particularly want is to make these requests even if the main JS execution thread is blocked eg by a window.alert. Im using Chrome 38.p  pHowever, when I attempt to make network requests in the worker, the requests appear to be blocked by the UI thread. Here is a contrived example to illustrate the problemp  pbase.jsp  precodevar worker  new Workerworker.js  setTimeoutfunction      console.logbegin blocking     var startDt  new Date     var blockPeriod  5000     var a      Obviously wed never actually do this, but this while loop      is a convenient way to create the problem case a blocked main      thread.     while new Date  startDt lt blockPeriod          a  0          console.logstop blocking , 3000 codepre  pworker.jsp  precodevar requestInterval  1000  var sendRequest  function      console.logSend request interval      var request  new XMLHttpRequest     request.openGET, ping, true      request.onload  function          if request.status  200             console.logrequest.responseText          else              console.logrequest.status                    request.onerror  function          console.logerror           request.send      setTimeoutsendRequest, requestInterval   sendRequest codepre  pThe result Im seeing is that we see successful HTTP requests for three seconds, until the blocking begins. At this point, we dont see anything logged to the console until the blocking ends, at which point we see five Send request intervals followed by 5 logs of the response, like sop  precodeSend request interval pong true Send request interval  pong true  Send request interval pong true Send request interval pong true begin blocking stop blocking 5x Send request interval 5x pong true Send request interval pong true codepre  pI also see in my server logs that no requests are made in that blocking time, then those five requests are all received roughly simultaneously at the end of the blocking period.p  pGiven that Send request interval occurs five times in a row, the worker is evidently continuing to execute if it werent, it wouldnt make it through to queue up the next iteration. Ive also found that if I block by triggering a window.alert instead of spinning in a loop, I get the log messages from the beginning of codesendRequestcode at 1 second intervals, and then get the response handler log messages in a large batch as soon as I stop blocking.p  pIn Firefox, the background thread seems to stop entirely in this case I dont get that same batch of five requests queued up during the blocked period. However, Im only targeting Chrome in this case and I ultimately want to use WebSockets which dont even work in Firefox Workers, so Im not really interested in that.p  pAll added together, this leads me to believe that there are some classes of activity in Web Workers which are blocked by the spawning thread, and some which are not I originally saw this same behavior with WebSockets. Concretely, Id like to know if anyone does knowp  ol liWhat Worker activity is blocked by the main thread in Chromeli liIs there a way to work around this Id very much like to be able to able to establish a WebSocket connection in a Worker, and then continue to PINGPONG back and forth, even if something such as an alertconfirm does block the main thread.li liIs this all nonsense, and am I just doing something stupidli ol

Negative 1866 pSo Im trying to sell my first personal software product online a hrefhttpwww.thingiequery.com relnofollowshameless pluga. Its a VSTO Excel plugin which Im having trouble distributing. Ive made a wix bootstrap installer and hosted it on the project website. While my product might not be fantabulous, Im pretty sure its not malware. However when people download it the following software seems to think otherwisep  ol liBrowsersli liWindows 8 SmartScreenli liAntivirus softwareli ol  pThe browsers warn the user that the .exe could be dangerous as its not often downloaded, Windows SmartScreen warns the user that the installer might be dangerous and advises the user not to install it, antivirus software sees the dlls the ones that are obfuscated as threats. p  pI dont think many people will install my software with all these warnings. My question is How does a 1man software startup distribute software with all these roadblocks p  pWould buying an EV certificate solve all of the above problems Can I use such a certificate to sign my wix bootstrap installer p  pAlso, if I use a normal non EV authenticode certificate to sign my files and installer, how long could it take to build up enough reputation to satisfy SmartScreen I know it probably depends, but Id like to hear peoples experiences with this.p

Negative 1866 pI am hoping to get a few highlevel suggestions on the best way to approach a what I believe to be a common unobtrusive js validation problem.p  pI have a form that loads a partial that contains country and state dropdowns. The forms view model requires country but does not require state for obvious reasons. When the country changes, I load, via AJAX, the appropriate state data into the state dropdown listp  pWhen a country is selected that does require a state, such as USA, Canada and Australia, I want to make the state dropdown required. My thought was to add a rule to the element via  .validator .rulesadd... before I call parse but I am gettingp  pTypeError c.data... is undefinedp  pI am not sure why the form data is not available at this point in the code or if my approach is even the best choice. To me, it seems like the simplest way.p  pHere is some of the code. I am keeping it brief intentionally but I can add more if needed.p  precodeifmakeStateRequired     ProspectState.rulesadd,  required true, messages  required  State is required       .validator.unobtrusive.parsefrmProspectMemberDialog   btnSave.onclick, function e          e.preventDefault         var form  frmProspectMemberDialog         if form.valid              loadingarea.show             .ajax                 type POST,                 url form.attraction,                 data form.serializeArray,                 success function data                  ...                                         codepre

Negative 1866 pIm developing an application but I had problems with the DBhad multiple instances[however it was a public static in my MainActivity] in every activity and returned wrong values, deleted something but existed on other activies, etc... So I decided to rewrite the whole thing from scratch, now, I understand the queriesinsert, update, delete, select, also had experience from mysql before but I dont know how to use the database properly between activities, how to have a global instance of it when to close the database What to pass in context when calling it in static, or noncontextual classmethod I would very appreciate if someone would give me a good example of how to do these things, I almost read every tutorial on google, but these are more about the base insert, update and delete stuff, than using it globally.

Negative 1866 pIm investigating an approach to implement npm with dedupe as a dependency manager instead of bower. And now, I have npm packages like jqueryui that use CommonJS require statements to include dependencies like jquery. p  pBefore using npm, I used reqular jqueryui script, without require. So now I guess I have to use Browserify to generate JavaScript that can be used inside the browser. p  pAnd now I have a questions lets consider jquery amp jqueryui example if I have other packages or my own code that uses jQuery, does it mean I always must have one output file from Browserify For instance jqueryui depends on jquery, and my own code also depends on jquery. If I have two separate output builds eg p  pcode browserify jqueryui.js o distjqueryui.js browserify myCode.js o distmyCode.js codep  pthen this approach is bad, because Ill have two jquery included twice.

It seems, however, as if the combination of codeEntityGraphcode and the codeINcode clause causes problems. It seems to be a bug. If I remove the codeINcode clause and change the method to look up a single company, everything works fine with the entity graph.

The original issue was that the image that was deployed to all the machines ended up having the login cookie and webcache data for one of our IT users in the default profile that all of the other local profiles build off of. This image was deployed during christmas break so countless users have already logged onto and created profiles on various machines. p

Negative 1866 pI have a WebBrowser control which navigates to different websites with different URLs I dont have any control over those websites in a developmentway, I just show them to the user. Those websites are getting called by the method WebBrowser.Navigatestring. What I know for sure is, that these websites I want to nagivate to do not load any childdocuments, so the DocumentCompletedEvent is only fired once per WebBrowser.Navigatestring call. I dont want the user to see how the browser engine is drawing up the new website, everytime navigating to a new page, but rather load the new website content in the background and display it to the user after the content is fully loaded and processed by the browser engine.p  pThere is this workaround to create a new WebBrowser instance in the background which navigates to the new website url and loads the content and after its fully fetched and built, instantly swap the active instance to the prepared instance in the background. Doing this, using the DocumentCompletedEvent. But this way seems quite ugly to me.p  pHow can I solve this the right wayp  pThanks in advance for your helpp  pahoip

Negative 1866 pIm trying to implement the simplest spinlock using TAS in C using inline assembly with the command xchg. Since my compiler error messages are getting more and more exotic and Im starting to grow grey hairs Ive decided to ask here. Also Im sorry if this question was already answered since I havent found anything.p  pWhat might needs to be said about my programming experience concerning this topic. Im doing pretty fine with C in my opinion, considering standard problems. Also I believe to know the basics about x86 but Im totally lost when it comes to constraints in inline assembler. What I found doing some googling is even more confusing to me since many sources say very different stuff.p  pMy code so farp  precodeint acquirelockint lock     int val  1     int lockcont     whilelockcont  lock  0             asmxchg 0 1  q val, m lockcont          return 0  codepre  pThis doesnt work for reasons that are probably obvious but are making me go nuts. Ive also tried some other variants but none of them even compiled. You can probably tell by now that I dont really know what Im doing so Id be more than happy for any kind of advice.p  pHere my compiler messages in case this helps p  precodemylock.c1711 error unexpected token in argument list             asmxchg 0 1  q val, m lockcont                      ltinline asmgt112 note instantiated into assembly here     xchg eax 16rbp                1 error generated. codepre  pThanks in advancep  pA desperate studentp  pEDITp  pI got the lock to work.. a do while loop and the comma did the trick.

Not quite happy with this result since this locks x for quite a long time but I guess Ill have to live with this.. I assume the problem is that between my asm instruction and the comparison from the while I cant guarantee atomicity when the locking and unlocking is such a fast stream of instructions for loop in threaddo since I dont see a workaround in C suggestions are welcome, Ill stick to this implementations since the general idea seems to be right.p

Negative 1866 pIm running Ubuntu 14. Ideally looking for a terminalbased solution.p  pI have about 300,000 photos that I plan on turning into a timelapse. The photos are all taken in 43 aspect ratio, and are 2592x1944 px. I will eventually string them together into a video, but first I want to get the dimensions right.p  pI want to make copies of each photo, converted to 169 aspect ratio, at 1920x1080 resolution. Its also important to be able to arbitrarily decide the specific pixels to crop not just cut x pixels from top, as I will at first be cropping out different amount of the top and bottom of the video. I do NOT want to distort the image by stretching it.p  pSince I have so many photos to work with 150 GB worth, I also want to make sure the process runs in a quick and efficient manner. I dont expect this process to be fast exactly, but I am looking for one of the faster methods available.p  pTLDR Looking to use Ubuntu terminal to make copies each photo, resize it into another directory, and crop it to my specified dimensions and aspect ratio.

Ive tried giving it a single dash codecode, but it creates a file with that name instead of directing to STDOUT.pli lipEven with the codeMDcode option enabled, codeascode attempts to assemble the source code, which could generate an error and halt the entire build process. I would expect it to output the dependencies instead of assembling the code, rather than performing both actions.pli ol  pWhile these are little more than annoyances right now, I can see this significantly affecting my builds as the project grows largerparticularly the latter. Is there a way to get codeascode to output dependencies without trying to assemble the codep

Negative 1866 pI get how the DFT via correlation works, and use that as a basis for understanding the results of the FFT.  If I have a discrete signal that was sampled at 44.1kHz, then that means if I were to take 1s of data, I would have 44,100 samples.  In order to run the FFT on that, I would have to have an array of 44,100 and a DFT with N44,100 in order to get the resolution necessary to detect a frequencies up to 22kHz, right  Because the FFT can only correlate the input with sinusoidal components up to a frequency of N2p  pThats obviously a lot of data points and calculation time, and I have read that this is where the Shorttime FT STFT comes in.  If I then take the first 1024 samples 23ms and run the FFT on that, then take an overlapping 1024 samples, I can get the continuous frequency domain of the signal every 23ms.  Then how do I interpret the output  If the output of the FFT on static data is N2 data points with fsN2 bandwidth, what is the bandwidth of the STFTs frequency outputp  pHeres an example that I ran in Mathematicap  p100Hz sine wave at 44.1kHz sample rate img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comzGFLm.png altenter image description herep  pThen I run the FFT on only the first 1024 points img srchttpi.stack.imgur.combBc8A.png altenter image description herep  pThe frequency of interest is then at data point 3, which should somehow correspond to 100Hz.  I think 441001024  43 is something like a scaling factor, which means that a signal with 1Hz in this little window will then correspond to a signal of 43Hz in the full data array.  However, this would give me an output of 43Hz3  129Hz.  Is my logic correct but not my implementation  p

For example, Input  funamp time will result in Output  time p  pThis question has been asked a hrefhttpscodereview.stackexchange.comquestions65049findinglongestwordinastringbeforea, although the original question involved using a variety of string methods and a regexp.  I am a JS and programming noob and find this approach nonintuitive, and am trying to assess whether my alternate method is a feasible approach to this problemp  precodefunction LongestWordsen     var count     var max  0 loops thru string amp tallies letters in sequences   for i  0 i lt sen.length i         if sen.charAti gt A ampamp sen.charAti lt Z           sen.charAti gt a ampamp sen.charAti lt z              count  sen.charAti conditional tracks longest letter string to date             if count.length gt max                 max  count                                     resets count if it encounters a non letter value in string     else          count                    return max   codepre  pThis seems to work in that it recognizes whether or not the first char is a letter or not and logs it to my var count, but its not iterating through the array as Id expected.p  pIs this a valid approach  Or do I need to learn more about string methods and regexp before I come back to this  Thanksp
Negative 1866 pI use Linux Mint and am mail merging labels in Libreoffice.p  pMy mail merge data is in a spreadsheet.p  pAn obstacle to migrating from MS Office for me was understanding that, when mail merging, Libreoffice writer imports database tables not spreadsheets.p  pSo to make this easy, and remove this obstacle, a script placed in the same directory as the single table spreadsheet, worksheetsheet1, that connects to the spreadsheet and creates the Libreoffice database file, would be really helpful.p  pI dont know how to do it, though for someone else it may be an off the top of the head job. p  pThe script needs to  Open Libreoffice, then connect to the spreadsheets worksheet, sheet1, then save itself as the same name as the spreadsheet, in the same directory, with same file name and the database file extension.p  pSuch a script would significantly reduce the overhead of mail merging using libreoffice. p  pAnyone know how to do thisp  pThank you p

Negative 1866 pI have a plugin 1 with a Class UserObjects that implements ISharedObjects ans Serializable, which belongs to plugin 2.p  pNow, my plugin 2 is a framework to synchronize data between clients. in plugin 2, I have a public method setSharedObjects ISharedObjects object. After that I serialize the data in plugin2 and send it to other clients, that also receive it in plugin 2 and deserialize it.p  pNow from my design, the frameworkplugin 2 should be generic and dont know all implementations of ISharedObject, that other plugins could use.  So I call in plugin 1 setSharedObjects UserObjects objectsnew UserObjects. It is serialized properly, and is transported to other clients. But when they try to deserialize it, they get ClassNotFoundException, because their plugin 2framework does not know the Class UserObjects, that lies in plugin 1. I cannot simply pass the string to plugin 1 and deserialize it there, because it would destroy my whole concept.I also cannot simply import plugin 1 in plugin 2, because I would get loop errors and also my framework should be generic and dont have any informations about the userplugin plugin 1 in this casep  pIs there any possibility to still make this work I thought about 2 possible options, but can not het option 1 to run, and have no exact clues to option 2. Option 1 my plugin 2 defines a SharedObject class, and UserObjects extends SharedObject. then for the transport I cast everything to SharedObject and deserialize it.p  pSecond option during serialization I store the classloader path of UserObjects in my serialized data, and during deserialization I retrieve this path and it works. But for this solution I have not found, how I can concretely implement it, and would be thankful for any clues.p  pAt the moment I use this serialization functionp  precodepublic String serializeObjectToStringObject object          String encodednull                 ByteArrayOutputStream byteArrayOutputStream  new ByteArrayOutputStream        ObjectOutputStream objectOutputStream      try          objectOutputStream  new ObjectOutputStreambyteArrayOutputStream                      objectOutputStream.writeObjectobject                      objectOutputStream.close      catch IOException e          e.printStackTrace           encoded  new StringBase64.encodeBase64byteArrayOutputStream.toByteArray     return encoded         public static Object deserializeObjectFromStringString objectString throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException                byte[] bytes  Base64.decodeBase64objectString.getBytes     Object object  null       try         ObjectInputStream objectInputStream  new ObjectInputStream new ByteArrayInputStreambytes         object  objectInputStream.readObject        catch IOException e         e.printStackTrace        catch ClassNotFoundException e         e.printStackTrace        catch ClassCastException e         e.printStackTrace              return object codepre  pIf I can realize it with another serializationdeserialization function, than simply tell me with which one.

Negative 1866 pstrongIs log2 n  log log n or log n2strongp  pI was reading about masters theorem and then encountered a video a hrefhttpswww.youtube.comwatchvlPUhHmgrpik relnofollow titlethisherea. Here, Mr Ravula said that log2 n is not log n  log n, but later in his video, precisely at 1150th min, he wrote nlog n as nlog1 n. So I am confused about this because          nlog nnlog n1, which shouldnt be nlog1 n as per the video. Can someone please help me understand the difference between the two log representations my basics seems to be hazy over this topic.  If I have an equation for masters theorem TnaTnbfn with fn of the form log nlog n, so can I write it as log2 n or does log2 n represent as the Mr Ravula told log log np

Negative 1866 pWe have an automation framework that uses Cucumber  Appium to test an iOS application.p  pAppium is fine, but one of its limitations is that we need to run every test from the beginning, which slows down development.

He kept saying you can only have one setting for ALL the sites either 5.4 or 5.5 but thats not been the case.  If my other site site54.com is on 5.5, it breaks.  Right now, site55.com is on 5.5 and working fine, while site54.com is on 5.4 and working fine.

The API accepts assessment.name and assessment.id. But the parameter in the api.assessmentretrieve is triggering the wrong thing.This is what I believe due to the codeassessment  api.retrieveassessmentrequest.routeurlassessment, ididcode because when
