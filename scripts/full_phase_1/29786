It doesnt work in Firefox or Opera Firefox does nothing, Opera complains the URL is invalid.li liI dont have a Windows box handy atm so Im unsure if computershare works in anything apart from IE e.g. Firefox  Opera.li liIf you have a better idea for consolidating a bunch of random samba shares it certainly cant get much worse than mine  its worth knowing that there is no guarantee that any of the servers I would be wanting to index  consolidate would be up at any particular moment. Moreover, I wouldnt want the knowledge of what they have shared lost or hidden just because they werent available. I would want to know that they share foo but they are currently down.li ul

Negative 29786 pOne of the functionalities in a Django project I am writing is sending a newsletter. I have a model, codeNewslettercode and a function, codesendnewslettercode, which I have registered to listen to codeNewslettercodes codepostsavecode signal. When the newsletter object is saved via the admin interface, codesendnewslettercode checks if codecreatedcode is True, and if yes it actually sends the mail.p  pHowever, it doesnt make much sense to edit a newsletter that has already been sent, for the obvious reasons. Is there a way of making the codeNewslettercode object readonly once it has been savedp  h2Edith2  pI know I can override the codesavecode method of the object to raise an error or do nothin if the object existed. However, I dont see the point of doing that. As for the former, I dont know where to catch that error and how to communicate the user the fact that the object wasnt saved. As for the latter, giving the user false feedback the admin interface saying that the save succeded doesnt seem like a Good Thing.p  pWhat I really want is allow the user to use the Admin interface to write the newsletter and send it, and then browse the newsletters that have already been sent. I would like the admin interface to show the data for sent newsletters in an noneditable input box, without the Save button. Alternatively I would like the Save button to be inactive.p

Negative 29786 pI am trying to learn how Hibernate works, and I am running into an almost unacceptable learning curve.

It is also not possible to disable the use of the assignment operator thus opening up the option of the user to create a broken class by using the incomplete default assignment operator codeA obj1,obj2 obj2obj1  Could result is an incorrectly initialized obj2 code .p  pIt would be good to relax the requirement that to codeaorig.a,borig.b...code in addition to codea0,b0 ...code must be written.

Negative 29786 pI have a legacy system where I want to improve the user experience. On one of the forms there are 2 drop down listboxes the change of one ddl cascades to the next. On the current form, this is acheived by selectedindexchanged event from which the other ddl can be repopulated. Although this works, in order for the event to be fired, the control has to have the autopostbacktrue property set. This postback creates a bad user experience. So the simple solution is to put the ddls into an update panel control. However doing this has the odd knock on effect of disabling my JQuery Cluetip controls. I do not know why this is. In which case it is time I finally got round to populating my controls using JQuery andor AJAX. So I have tried the following solution below in a test application. However when I click on the submit button, the changes I make to the Sub Categories ddl are not being picked up in the code behind event for my button a server side control. The reason appears to be that the client side updates happened after the last postback, and so on the server the control still has the previous values. How do I pick up the new values on server side, or should I try something else I am using a server control button because that is what the orginal legacy code does, and changing everything to client side would be a big job.p  pThe web pagep  precodelt Page LanguageC AutoEventWireuptrue  CodeFileDefault.aspx.cs InheritsDefault gt  ltDOCTYPE html PUBLIC W3CDTD XHTML 1.0 TransitionalEN httpwww.w3.orgTRxhtml1DTDxhtml1transitional.dtdgt  lthtml xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtmlgt lthead runatservergt     lttitlegtlttitlegt     ltlink hrefCSSRM.css relstylesheet typetextcss gt     ltscript typetextjavascript srchttpjqueryjs.googlecode.comfilesjquery1.3.2.min.jsgtltscriptgt     ltscript typetextjavascript srcDefault.jsgtltscriptgt ltheadgt ltbodygt     ltform idform1 runatservergt     ltdivgt         lth1gtTest Categorieslth1gt           lttablegt         lttrgt         ltth classwid3gtCategoryltthgt         lttd classwid4gtltaspDropDownList                  IDCategoriesddl runatserver DataSourceIDodsCategories                  DataTextFieldCategory1 DataValueFieldCategoryID                  gt            ltaspDropDownListgt            lttdgt         ltth classwid3gtSub Categoryltthgt        lttd classwid4gtltselect                  IDSubCategoriesddl runatserver DataSourceIDodsSubCategories4Category                  DataTextFieldSubCategory1 DataValueFieldSubCategoryIdgt            ltselectgtlttdgt        lttrgt        lttablegt        ltaspObjectDataSource runatserver IDodsCategories              TypeNameClassLibraryRiskManCategories.DAL SelectMethodGetCategories gt        ltaspObjectDataSource runatserver IDodsSubCategories4Category              TypeNameClassLibraryRiskManCategories.DAL SelectMethodGetSubCategoriesgt             ltSelectParametersgt                 ltaspControlParameter ControlIDCategoriesddl NamecategoryId                      PropertyNameSelectedValue TypeInt32 gt             ltSelectParametersgt        ltaspObjectDataSourcegt         ltdiv stylepadding100pxgtltaspButton runatserver IDbtnTest TextSubmit                 onclickbtnTestClick gtltdivgt     ltdivgt     ltformgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pThe JScriptp  precodedocument.readyfunction      Categoriesddl.changefunction          SubCategoriesddl.html         var CategoryId  Categoriesddl gt optionselected.attrvalue         if CategoryId  0              .getJSONLoadSubCategories.ashxCategoryId  CategoryId, functionSubCategory1                  .eachSubCategory1, function                      SubCategoriesddl.appendltoptiongtltoptiongt.valthis[SubCategoryId].toString.htmlthis[SubCategory1]                                              codepre

Then what change i need to do to my existing functions so that they communicate to hadoop file system to do basic operations on the file.

Negative 29786 pIn a spring application I want do some background computing. The task is that I save an entity lets say a GPS coordinate and then I want to query a web service to get distance between all the coordinates and store them in the db for later use. There is a possibility that after storing the entity, connection cannot be made to the web service which will be used for calculation of the distances.p  pI think that this can be accomplished with introducing a job in the system some thing like a cron job. Once we want some thing to happen in the background we put it in a job queue. The queue will try to execute the first job it receives, A job will go and connect to the web service, if for some reason it fails, it stays in the queue and tells the queue that it failed. The queue can then execute after a specified time for retry.. When its successfully a job complete it is taken out of the job queue.p  pI am clear on the requirements, but I am not sure which technology to use. JMX, JMS, Spring Task Scheduler, Spring Integration, mixmatch or all.p  pThis seems similar to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1939229howtocreatebackgroundprocessinspringwebapphttpstackoverflow.comquestions1939229howtocreatebackgroundprocessinspringwebappa but not entirelyp  pstrongEditstrong Lets add to it a bit further.

There is no way to update the text catalog without rebooting the server every time. Maybe if someone can create a demo of this for mep  pAlso, would like it to support UTF8. The data should be consistent.p  pSo what is wrong with this implementation  Why use gettext  How can it be used to improve translations to work for both UTF8 and non UTF8 language strings so that it can be translated.p  pstrongEDITstrong Please note, the files will eventually need to be renamed to  codeManageDPModules.[language].phpcode, codeDreamPortal.[language].phpcode, etc., etc. in order for the translations to work.  So, how would catalogs help me in this regard  If you want to see possible ENDRESULT Translations, you can download a language package located a hrefhttpdreamportal.netindex.phpactiondownloadsarealangpacks relnofollowherea and open up the .german.php language files to see what it should look like after the member submits a language on a file by file basis.  Noted that some of these packages have UTF8 strings, and some do not.  The filename of the packages let you know this.  Would be nice if I can also make it support UTF8, but it is not a requirement.  Please note, Im not trying to create complete packages here.  I just want to create the languagefile.[language].php with all of the translated strings inside of them which my code already does.p  pOK, I will provide the ENTIRE index.php file for this so you can see what it does exactly when you do translations.  Here is the a hrefhttpacs.graphicsmayhem.comrc4index.phpactiondreamFilesmod17id6 relnofollowindex.phpa file for this and youll need some english language files a hrefhttpacs.graphicsmayhem.comrc4index.phpactiondreamFilesmod17id2 relnofollowDreamPortal.english.phpa, a hrefhttpacs.graphicsmayhem.comrc4index.phpactiondreamFilesmod17id3 relnofollowManageDPModules.english.phpa, and a hrefhttpacs.graphicsmayhem.comrc4index.phpactiondreamFilesmod17id4 relnofollowDreamHelp.englishutf8.phpa.  Now, in order to see this, you need to upload to a server, index.php, create a few folders where index.php is, call 1 english, and create a folder in there for each additional language you want I did 2 folders, spanish and french, than upload the 3 language files into the english folder.  Run index.php in your browser and you will see it working.p  pNow, how could I use gettext for catalogs with this SAME approach.  I need to enable online translation of files.  I need to create PHP files of the translations in the SAME style that the .english.php files are with the same PREFIX that is before code.english.phpcode, and I need to change the language within the filename to the same language defined for the folder name.  Online translations is the ONLY method available.  Translators need to focus ONLY on translating the strings.  They shouldnt be focusing on installing programs, packaging it up, renaming the files, etc. etc..  This makes this process as painless as possible allowing it to be done online.  And I know there is a way to do this, and even for UTF8 support.  But Im using the best method that I know how at the moment.  But so many of you are MUCH smarter at this sort of thing than I am, so I ask for help from you guys.p  pIs there anyone that can show me a better way  An example like the one that I have given you in this questionp  pstrongI need to allow translations to be done ONLINE from translators, and would also like it to support UTF8 files, as well as non UTF8 files.strong  I like the way I have it setup for the link provided above a hrefhttpacs.graphicsmayhem.comtest3index.php relnofollowTRANSLATIONS TESTa so that translators can just do the translations online and not have to worry about anything else, and it would automatically create the files needed.  Which would be the same as the english filename of the language with the folder name representing the language after the first strong.strong dot and it needs to have the extension .php like it does in the code I am currently using.  So basically, I need an adaption of the current index.php to support UTF8 and non UTF8 for all or most languages, and was told that using gettext and catalog files would help with this.p  pLooking for a modified version of my current index.php to use gettext in a way that it will support most, if not all, languages and translations.  The REGEX I got going on for pregreplace isnt completely satisfactory because it seems to place a forward slash in front of double quotes when savingsubmitting the translations.  So perhaps an improvement on the pregreplace would be needed also.p  pI provided a complete example with ACTUAL CODE bytheway. Id like for someone to alter this example, with the CODE that I provided to USE GETTEXT instead and support UTF8. Or actually provide a ACTUAL METHOD for me to do this myself with. Not looking for a bunch of links that I can find on my ownp  pThank Youp

Which was fine for the size of projects I was doing.p  pHowever my projects have been getting bigger in size and complexity and now I want to start reusing code, and making my head a simpler place.p  pThe main problem I have is generally along the lines of codePlayercode needs to know about the codeMapcode and so does the codeEnemycode, this has usually descended into setting lots of pointers and having lots of dependencies, and this becomes a mess quickly.p  pI have thought along the lines of a message style system. but I cant really see how this reduces the dependencies, as I would still be sending the pointers everywhere.p  pThanks.p  psupPS I guess this has been discussed before, but I dont know what its called just the need I have.supp

And whats calling this is indeed calling it many times, with many different parameters, very quickly.

Negative 29786 pProblem Im working on a project for school my choice which is a program loaderDLL injector, the idea of which I initially found a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comKBcppcodecave.aspx relnofollowherea, modified to suit my needs, and converted the ASM portions of the DLL to extended ASM that will compile with GCC instead of Visual Studio. Rather than do the pinball score print in a console window thing, Im loading a program I wrote that takes input from a user and writes it to a file. The loader injects a DLL with a function in it that redirects user input, formerly destined for a file, to a messagebox, and will write my own string to the file. p  pIt works on my machine, however, I have concerns about platform switching because my professor has to compile the work on her machine, so it is possible that the address 0x004014A6, which currently contains the instruction to codeCALL ltsome addressgtcode which writes that string to a filethe actual code is codeofile ltlt userinputcode wont contain anything close to that when compiled on another machine, but will still have a call to that function that writes a string to a file.p  pWhat I want to do is dynamically determine what that address will be, as opposed to hardcoding the address. I think I can do this by using GetProcAddress on the function that gets called to get the address, then create an array to hold the bytes representing codeCALL ltthat functiongtcode, and search byte by byte in memory somewhere around where I expect to find that call to be made, take the address, and work from there. p  pI dont know exactly how to do that, though.p  pMAIN QUESTION  How can I scan a range of memory addresses and compare the contents to elements of an arrayp  pPut another way, I want to include in my DLL a function that reads bytes at an arbitrary address in memory and compares it to an expected sequence. How can I just arbitrarily read contents of memory addresses within a certain process p  pSuspicions Ill need to know the starting and ending addresses where execution of the original program takes place. How can I get the range between starting and ending addresses This seems like the real hurdle here. I can probably get the rest knowing only how to obtain the processes beginning and ending addresses.p

Negative 29786 pI need to accomplish fairly complex animations on my website where elements slide up and down, CSS properties are manipulated and so on. I wonder how to do this in an elegant way. p  pActions fire onclick, another click should revert everything until the site is in its original state again. p  pWhat I not want to do is write a function likep  precodesomebutton.onclickfunction          ifthis.hasClassclicked               this.slideDown              that.show              button.cssposition,absolute               more things going on            else                revert all things gone on              this.slideUp              that.hide              button.cssposition,static            codepre  pp  pThat means I do not want to write all these statements twice, or even worse, most of the animations are the same in 70 . I did not want to write that over and over again.p  pWhat I thought of was something like an animation queue, which I can manipulate, pop and shift and most important revert. I found jQuerys queueFunction, but there is one point I get stuckp  ul liponce the custom queue is dequeued it is not present any more, that means I can animate the element once, but I cant say for example p  pmyQueue.queueanimate.reversepli ul  pafter myQueue was fired because it is empty at this point.p  pThis lengthy explanation is not just for this simple queue problem.

Then Player B logs on and starts the game and gets the score from player A.p  pIf I save the last playerID and just use that, you get into the situation of player B starting a game after player A and all scores go to player A, or are lost for player A when player B starts.p  pOr is it just not worth worrying about stuff like this because its lt1 likely to ever happenp  pOr am I just missing the simple solution to all this stuffp  pGame Center is just a complete mess of edge cases.  Apple could have done a much better job on this API.p

Negative 29786 pSo I know functionally what I would like to happen, I just dont know the best way to make a computer do it... in C...p  pI would like to implement a C function that maps a 10 bit sequence to a 6 bit sequence.p  pNevermind what the bits stand for right now... There are 210  1024 possible inputs. There are 26  64 different outputs. Probably lots of patterns. Obviously lots of patterns. But its complicated. Its s a known mapping, just a complicated mapping.p  pThe output is just one of 64 possibilities.  Maybe they all dont get used.  They probably wont.  But assume they do.p  pRight now, Im thinking a quadruple nested switch statement that just takes care of each of the 1024 cases and takes care of business inline, assigning appropriate values to whatever pointer to whatever structure I passed to this function. This seems to be naive and sort of slow. Not that Ive implemented it, but thats why I want to ask you first.p  pThis basic function mapping will have to be run at every statement node, often more than once, for as many statements this system wishes to support. I ask you, how do I map 10 bits to 6 bits as efficiently as possible in Cp  pI know what the mapping is, I know which inputs of 10 bits go with what output of 6 bits... I could totally hardcode that ... somehow Multiswitch is so ugly. How can I map my 10 bits to 6 bits Neural net Memory muffin What would you dop  pNote to self  So here is why I am not a fan of the lookup table.  Lets assume all inputs are equally likely of course they are not, and could be ordered more effectively, but still then it will take on average 512 memory advances of the array to retrieve the output values... It seems that if you make a global, why not binary tree 10 levels deep, you cover the 1024 inputs and can retrieve the output in an average of just 10 steps...  and maybe less if there are good patterns... given a deterministic function that is run so often, how best to retrieve known outputs from known inputsp

Im not sure if Im too new at this to see the error or if Ive been staring at it for too long.  The output shows the array is filled correctly, but the target is always 0, so the 11th int gets placed in the next array.

Negative 29786 pIm creating a small search engine for some data and need to use MyiSAM because of its fulltext search feature.  Unfortunately I also need to use transactions for commits and rollbacks to ensure entry of the data that will be searched.p  pIve created an InnoDb table for data storage because it can do commit and rollback, and a MyiSAM table that is an exact copy of the InnoDb table for using fulltext search. The problem now is keeping these tables in sync.p  pIm looking for an efficient way to keep the MyiSAM table synced with the InnoDb table.  I cant use triggers because I dont want anything stored in the MyiSAM table until data is committed to the InnoDb table.p  pIm okay with writing some code that will sync the tables on commit, but Im not sure of a fast way to combine the two tables.  The tables may potentially be huge and I dont want the user waiting an hour to insert one record.  In the same context, I dont want the user to be unable to access the search engine at some time in the day for an hour as a cron job syncs the two tables and locks the MyiSAM table.p  pOne thing to mention too, is my MySQL server is on Bluehost and therefore MySQL is locked on version 5.1, so I cant use the new InnoDb fulltext search with version 5.6.  And of course I cant install any third party search server like sphinx on Bluehost.p  pIf anyone has a good solution to my problem, Id be very grateful.p

Negative 29786 pI am a bit new to LINQ and to Entity Framework, so rather simple SQL queries are causing me a headache.

Negative 29786 pUsing Java, I want to strip the fragment identifier and do some simple normalisation e.g., lowercase schemes, hosts of a diverse set of URIs. The input and output URIs should be equivalent in a general HTTP sense.p  pTypically, this should be straightforward. However, for URIs like codehttpblah.orgA28Secret29.xmlblahcode, which percent encodes codeSecretcode, the behaviour of codejava.util.URIcode makes life difficult. p  pThe normalisation method should return codehttpblah.orgA28Secret29.xmlcode since the URIs codehttpblah.orgA28Secret29.xmlcode and codehttpblah.orgASecret.xmlcode are not equivalent in interpretation [2.2 a hrefhttpwww.ietf.orgrfcrfc3986.txtRFC3968a]p  pSo we have the two following normalisation methodsp  precodeURI u  new URIhttpblah.orgA28Secret29.xmlblah System.out.printlnu          prints httpblah.orgA28Secret29.xmlblah  String path1  u.getPath      gives ASecret.xml String path2  u.getRawPath   gives A28Secret29.xml   NORMALISE METHOD 1 URI norm1  new URIu.getScheme.toLowerCase, u.getUserInfo,                        u.getHost.toLowerCase, u.getPort, path1,                        u.getQuery, null System.out.printlnnorm1  prints httpblah.orgASecret.xml  NORMALISE METHOD 2 URI norm2  new URIu.getScheme.toLowerCase, u.getUserInfo,                       u.getHost.toLowerCase, u.getPort, path2,                        u.getQuery, null System.out.printlnnorm2  prints httpblah.orgA2528Secret2529.xml codepre  pAs we see, the URI is parsed and rebuilt without the fragment identifier. p  pHowever, for method 1, codeu.getPathcode returns an unencoded URI, which changes the final URI.p  pFor method 2, codeu.getRawPathcode returns the original path, but when passed to the codeURIcode constructor, Java decides to add doubleencoding.p  pThis feels like a Chinese finger trap. p  pSo two main questionsp  ul listrongWhy does codejava.util.URIcode feel the need to play with encodingstrongli listrongHow can this normalise method be implemented without fiddling with the original percent encodingstrongli ul  pI would rather not have to implement the parseconcatenate methods of codejava.util.URIcode, which are nontrivial.p  hr  pstrongEDITstrong Heres some further info from a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase6docsapijavanetURI.htmlcodeURIcode javadoca.p  ul lipstrongThe singleargument constructorstrong requires any illegal characters in its argument to be quoted and strongpreserves any escaped octetsstrong and other characters that are present.pli lipThe strongmultiargument constructorsstrong quote illegal characters as required by the components in which they appear. strongThe percent character  is always quoted by these constructors.strong Any other characters are preserved.pli lipThe getRawUserInfo, stronggetRawPathstrong, getRawQuery, getRawFragment, getRawAuthority, and getRawSchemeSpecificPart methods return the values of their corresponding components in raw form, strongwithout interpreting any escaped octetsstrong.

Negative 29786 pIn this particular application, there is no separate data layer and the data access code is in the Entity itself.

But wouldnt you want an exception to be throw when the value you are reading from the db does not conform to what your code expects I mean in this case, if there is a wrong phone number in the db then perhaps the object shouldnt be initialized at all instead of loading an object with an empty phone numberp

Negative 29786 pHow can I get a direction vector representing the direction the back of the device is pointing relative to earth coordinatesp  pFor example, if place down on a desk screen facing up it should read [0,0,1] and if held vertically facing north it should read [1,0,0], etc.p  pI know how to calculate it from heading, pitch, and roll, as long as those are relative to earth coordinates.

Negative 29786 pIm trying to develop a GTK application in Python and Im really stuck with the correct usage of a a hrefhttpdeveloper.gnome.orggtk3stableGtkTreeStore.html relnofollowcodegtk.TreeStorecodea. My main problem Ive already parsed some JSON and I have my own data structure which ist basically a Python list and two kinds of objects One represents a collection of items collections cant be nested and one for representing items which might appear in the list as well as in a collection.p  pIm already familiar with the basic usage of a codeTreeStorecode and managed to get items correctly rendered on screen. I dont know how to deal with the fact that a treestore is only capable of storing gobject types at this point Im not sure because I dont know much about the gobject type system. The documentation for C lists the following, except PixBuf basic types which can be inserted and are automagically mapped to Python data typesp  blockquote   pAs an example, gtktreestorenew 3, GTYPEINT, GTYPESTRING, GDKTYPEPIXBUF will create a new GtkTreeStore with three columns, of type int, string and GdkPixbuf respectively. p blockquote  pFurthermore it says you may insert any a hrefhttpdeveloper.gnome.orggobjectunstablegobjectTypeInformation.htmlGType relnofollowcodeGTypecodea. The link from the documentation directly points at this paragraphp  blockquote   pA numerical value which represents the unique identifier of a registered type. p blockquote  pMy research of the topic ends here and Google finds mostly GTK 2.x tutorials and nothing about inserting other data types except codestrcode and codeintcode etc.br Questionsp  ul lipIs it possible to implement a new GType or any other interface that will make insert custom data in a treestore possible and how to do itbr I already tried deriving from codeGObjectcode but it didnt help.pli lipHow can I get rid of keeping two data structures at the same timebr Namely my parsing result and the duplicate information in a Treestore.pli lipHow is it possible to deal with mixed contentbr In my case I have collections and items with different additional information which are mirrored in the treeview as nodes with or without children.pli ul  pIf above questions are resolved, I also get rid of the problem when handling selections it is difficult to match a simple type like codestrcode or codeintcode to match an item I inserted before. Such attribute has to be a key and still you would to search the list with parsed results which is quit ineffective.p  pThank you in advancep  pAdditional information not directly related to the questionp  hr  pI thought it could be a feasible challenge to implement a custom codeTreeModelcode until I read this in a a hrefhttpscentric.nettutorialseccustommodels.htmlseccustommodelswhen relnofollowtutorial for GTK 2ap  blockquote   pHowever, all this comes at a cost you are strongunlikely to write a useful custom model in less than a thousand linesstrong, unless you strip all newline characters. Writing a custom model is not as difficult as it might sound though, and it may well be worth the effort, not least because it will result in much saner code if you have a lot of data to keep track of. p blockquote  pIs this still validp  hr  pstrikeI just came across a hrefhttpwww.pygtk.orgarticlessubclassinggobjectsubclassinggobjectinpython.htm relnofollowhttpwww.pygtk.orgarticlessubclassinggobjectsubclassinggobjectinpython.htma Can this be helpful As many resoucres its for PyGTK 2.0.strike deprecated.p

Negative 29786 pCurrently I am creating an app. for the ipad that uses a media player.

Negative 29786 pIm building my first real django application which has different user roles and the normal User signal that creates an UserProfile approach is falling short. Could you guys help me out p  pTo give out more context, here are the requirements from a functional perspective p  ul liNew users are added only from the Admin and will be done by nontech savy people, so I need a user creation flow thats intuitive and easy.li liEach user has a role Manager, Employee, Salesman, etc with different needs and fields.li liThe user list needs to show both User Information and role  profile information login, email, name, and the extra information on profileli ul  pInitial approach p  pSo armed with this, I went with the recommended approach of creating a UserProfile 1to1 object linked to user, provide the UserProfile with a choice field where the role is set useful for knowing what im dealing with when calling getprofile  and subclassed UserProfile into ManagerUserProfile, EmployeeUserProfile, etc.p  pProblem p  pThat works for my needs in the frontend outside of the admin, but setting the signal to create a UserProfile when a User is created is pointless since I dont know what kind of UserProfile should I create based only on user information.p  pWhat Im aiming at is an atomic way of creating a particular User and its corresponding EmployeeUserProfileManagerUserProfile at the same time, and having a neat admin representation.p  pSome of my ideasp  ul lipHide the UserAdmin and User Profile admins, create AdminModels for EmployeeUserProfileManageretc and inline the User model. That way the person creating the users will see only a New Manager link with its corresponding fields. But they may create the UserProfile without a user  How can i make this atomic  How do i prevent from deleting the user within or make sure they provide all required info before allowing the profile to be saved   Problem with this approach  I cannot seem to inline the user because it has no PK to UserProfile its the other way around.pli lipAgain, hide UserAdmin, expose the subclassed profiles Admins, and reverse the signal. When a profile is created, create a corresponding user. But for this I need to be able to provide user fields username, pass, email, etc from profiles admin form.pli ul  pSuggestions p  pIts my first app and maybe theres a neat way for this, but I havent found it yet.p  pThanks for taking the time to read this.

Negative 29786 pWe are a small team two people intending to develop mobile device games. Initially it will be on iOS only, but will be ported to androidwindows phone. Cocos2d seems to be the best open source game engine for now. The problem Im discussing with coworker is whether we should use cocos2diphone objectc or cocos2dx c.p  pWe both have quite some experience with C, and I have played around with objectc for couple months in spare time. It is not that difficult to use objectc, but C is still more preferable. p  pInitially I intend to use cocos2diphone since most online documentsexamples are based on cocos2diphone. After playing around some cocos2dx samples, I feel they are quite similar. Considering we will port the game to android or windows phone, its probably better to use the c based cocos2dx for game engine related code, so it will be easier when porting the game.p  pIf anyone has practical working experience with cocos2dx, could you share your thought or comment Which one will you choose cocos2diphone or cocos2dx Thanks.p

Negative 29786 pIm pretty new to CQt and Im trying to create an application with Visual Studio C and Qt 4.8.3.

The weird thing happens beyond this size. When I set codeimgwidth16000code and codeimgheight8000code, for example, the line codeimg  new QImage...code returns a null image. The image data should be around 512,000,000 bytes, so it shouldnt be too large, even on a 32 bit system. Also, my machine Win 7 64bit, 8 GB RAM should be capable of holding the data.p  pIve also tried this version p  precodeuchar imgbuf  uchar mallocimgwidthimgheight4 QImage img  new QImageimgbuf,imgwidth,imgheight,QImageFormatRGB32 codepre  pAt first, this works. The img pointer is valid and calling codeimgwidthcode for example returns the correct image width instead of 0, in case the image pointer is null. But as soon as I call codeimgsetPixelcode, the pointer becomes null and codeimgwidthcode returns 0.p  pSo what am I doing wrong Or is there a better way of modifying large images on pixel levelp  pRegards, Davidp

Negative 29786 pIm new to PHP and I just figured out how to generate content from several arrays to populate 40 divs. Its a product gallery and the different parts are generated via a for loop.

For example, the function,well call it codeparsebetweencode would work as follows in Rp  precodegtmainstringltthe quick brown foxgt jumps over the lazy lt dog gtsubstringltparsebetweenmainstring, begingt, endlt gtsubstring [1]  jumps over the lazy  codepre  pEven better if it could produce a vector with elements corresponding to each instance. Ive searched some of the packages available for string manipulation like stringr but have not found a function to do this as easily as the example shows. My motivation is to parse html files unfortunately despite searching I havent found an html parser for R. p
Negative 29786 pI have a Test, Staging and Production environment several storage accounts and VMs in each.  p  pstrongDoes it make sense to have them all based in one Affinity Group or across 3 separate Affinity Groupsstrongp  pThe only communication that occurs between these environments is the downloading and restoring of the Production database to the other environments which is not time critical, but it is several gigs.p  pDo more entities in an affinity group make data transfer between them slower  I wouldnt want my Production environment to be slower because its Affinity Group is shared with Test and Staging.p  pAs far as I understand, transferring data in the same data center does not incur transfer costs.  But transferring data within a Affinity Group would be faster.p

Negative 29786 pI am using the Android codeMediaRoutercode API 16 and codePresentationcode API 17 classes to generate amp manage a secondary display.  I followed the example in a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidappPresentation.html relnofollowApiDemosa to create unique nonmirrored output, and so far it works fine testing with Nexus 10 connected to HDTV via HDMI cable.p  pNow, I have a situation where I want the Presentation object created in codeActivity Xcode to continue running on the secondary display, even if codeActivity Xcode invokes another codeActivity Ycode.  In this situation, codeActivity Xcode is still on the stack, but codeActivity Ycode is now on top of it.p  pThe problem is that when codeActivity Ycode starts, the physical secondary display reverts to mirroring.  When I exit codeActivity Ycode, the content of codeActivity Xscode Presentation goes back since I never called codedismisscode on it.p  pSo the question is strongHow can I keep a Presentation attached to a secondary display running on that display, even if a subordinate Activity is running on the local devicestrongp  pstrongUPDATEstrong One way I thought of doing this is to instantiate the codePresentationcode object from a background thread then the subsequent creation of another codeActivitycode should not interfere with the content being written by the background thread to its codePresentationcode object.  But Im not sure this will work, as its generally not allowed to update a UI from a background thread.  p  pAnother approach would be to disable the use of secondary displays by the subordinate codeActivitycode, if possible, thereby preventing it from reverting the secondary display to mirroring when the new codeActivitycode becomes active.  But I havent found a way to do this either.  Thanks again for any suggestions.p

Negative 29786 pI have a web app with a jqgrid which is populated with data using jquery ajax, which calls a webmethod. The jqgrid is refreshed every 5 seconds to poll data. what i would like to do is get new data that is added to the table every 5 seconds. p  pSo i thought i would modify my webmethod to get data in batches of 20, starting from the last ID read. What i thought is in the webmethod i would do a counter, firstRecordID, lastRecordIDRead variables, if counter  0 i would get the first record ID and store it in firstRecordID, if counter is larger than 0 than firstRecordID would be the lastRecordIDRead firstRecordID  20. So if the first ID in database is 906, on the first poll it would get records from 906 to 925, then in second poll it will get from 926  20 other records and continue like this. p  pWhen this method is used in a console app as an example it worked fine, however i cant understand how should i go to implement this when using a webservice, since a webservice is stateless i dont know how i should implement the counter variable etc. Any idea please Or maybe a solution which is betterp  pThanks a lot.p

It wont be a good idea to plot every single point because it would be very slow to launch the plot command every time.

How I do this This is not a good example because the numbers grow too quickly. And the plot initialization doesnt know the max y value in advance. Maybe it is better to use some other better graph packagep

Negative 29786 pI have a usecase for which I would like to know if HTML5s ServersentEvents is suitable.p  pMultiple clients JavascriptHTML5 browsers connect to the web server with a Java EE backend. Each client could be looking at a different view at any time, depending on what is their object of interest. p  pMy strongQuestionstrong is How to keep multiple clients on different views uptodate on the updates happening on the serverside, strongwithoutstrong flooding all clients with all updates on all views  p  pImportant points that I need to consider arep  ol liMany clients might be interested in the same events. If two clients are looking at the same view, they MUST get identical events.li liEvents to be sent to a client depend on the view that client is currently at.li liSome clients may not be interested in any events i.e they might be viewing static datali liA given client could be dynamically changing their interest. for ex close View1 and open View2.li liA client could be interested in multiple event channels for ex two dynamicallychanging views could be part of a single page.li liI can target only browsers with complete support for SSE.li liThere will only be a maximum of 100 clients browsers connected to the server at any time. So, I could have the luxury of having more than one connection open for SSE, per client.li ol  pI have searched SOGoogle for SSE and couldnt yet get reliable solution for production quality software. I dont want to go back to old Comet techniques, before fully exploring SSE.p  pIs SSE by itself capable of delivering on these requirements  I am looking into Atmosphere right now, but I dont want to resort to some polyfill that imitates SSE, before deciding that SSE wont be sufficient by itself.p  pstrongWhat I plan to do if this is not possiblestrong br The server could broadcast all events to all clients and let the clients figure it out. This would mean, lots of unnecessary traffic from server to client and complex client code.p

Negative 29786 pI didnt want to bloat one post here with a ton of .htaccess questions, so Im breaking them up individually. This one has to do with using codeRedirectMatchcode to create rules for existing, indexed pages that are part of an existing website.p  pSpecifically, my test site has been up for about a year and I am now using .htaccess to rewrite clean URLs for better SEO. So when I had a container page whose content was called based on a query string in a link, like sop  pcodehttpwww.website.comdepartments.phpdepcontactuscodep  pIm working on making the URL appear smoother likep  pcodehttpwww.website.comcontactuscodep  pThe tutorial I read suggested that changing my links to the new, snazzier SEOfriendly style would lead to lots of 404 errors and broken page links until the site has been indexed again and the records brought up to date.p  pThus, my question Is this a legitimate concern or will the new links be picked up in 2448 hoursp  pI ask because I have several websites with many layers of file structure and Im thinking that Id need a TON  of rules in my .htaccess file to fix all the broken links I may be creating.p  pIf Im creating confusion here, please let me know and Ill clarify things.p  pMany thanks in advancep

It seems like those are not totally supported by mobile browsers. Most of the articles I found about those are quite old however and things could have changed since then.p

With your help, I have decided to go with using a database. It works much more efficiently and so far, I havent run into any problems. For posterity, here is how it worksp  pstrongThe databasestrongp  pWorking in Android, I have set up an SQLite database and table for storing each tile. At first, I decided to run an insert query each time a tile is generated. This quickly turned out to be another performance bottleneck because each INSERT took a bit over 2ms to complete, throwing a wrench into even the smallest 300x300 tile generation process. I had to utilize a multiple INSERT query which took many tiles and stored them using a single query. So, I have created an tile buffer where each tile is stored with their coordinatesp  precodeA linked list of integers is good enough.  The first 2 are X and Y coordinates, the third one is the tile type.  I can add more fields if needed. this.tileDBbuffer  new LinkedListltInteger[]gt codepre  pHere is how the buffer is filledp  precodevoid addTileBufferint x,int y, MapTile maptile      int maxsize  10000     Integer[] tiledata     tiledata  new Integer[3]     tiledata[0]  x     tiledata[1]  y     tiledata[2]  maptile.type     if this.tileDBbuffer.sizegt maxsize          Log.dthis.getClass.toString, Buffer filled up... Saving         savemapbuffer          this.tileDBbuffer.addtiledata  codepre  pOnce the buffer reaches a certain size or the tile generation ends the savemapbuffer function is ran, which basically calls this function first, and then purges the bufferp  precodepublic void addTileBulkLinkedListltInteger[]gt maptiles      Integer[] tiledata  new Integer[3]      if db  null db  this.getWritableDatabase      String sql  INSERT INTO TABLENAMEMAP COLUMNNAMEMAPX, COLUMNNAMEMAPY, COLUMNNAMEMAPTILETYPE VALUES ,,     db.beginTransaction     SQLiteStatement stmt  db.compileStatementsql     try          while maptiles.isEmpty              tiledata  maptiles.pop             stmt.bindLong1,tiledata[0]             stmt.bindLong2,tiledata[1]             stmt.bindLong3,tiledata[2]             stmt.execute                  db.setTransactionSuccessful      finally          db.endTransaction            maptiles.clear  codepre  pstrongHashmap in usestrongp  pSoon after this, problems occurred while drawing the map. The drawing is done in another thread, so iterating through it while simultaneously generating new tiles threw lots of weird errors. After testing for a bit using is the map busy booleans, I ended up using a strongConcurrentHashmapstrong instead of a regular strongHashmapstrong. It worked.p  pstrongChunksstrongp  pAfter that, I ended up needing to use chunks after all. It was easier to manage discrete sections of the map rather than estimating which tiles to load based on player distance. So now, each HashMap element is a fixed 2 dimensional integer array, containing tiles. I call them strongCellsstrong p  precodemap  new ConcurrentHashMapltPoint, MapCellgt codepre  pand a cell is something like thisp  precodepublic class MapCell      public int x,y     private static int cellsize  32     public MapTile[][] tiles  new MapTile[cellsize][cellsize]  codepre  pNow.

Negative 29786 pHaving learned loads from answers on this site thanks, its finally time to ask my own question.p  pIm using R tm and lsa packages to create, clean and simplify, and then run LSA latent semantic analysis on, a corpus of about 15,000 text documents. Im doing this in R 3.0.0 under Mac OS X 10.6.p  pFor efficiency and to cope with having too little RAM, Ive been trying to use either the PCorpus backend database support supported by the filehash package option in tm, or the newer tm.plugin.dc option for socalled distributed corpus processing. But I dont really understand how either one works under the bonnet.p  pAn apparent bug using DCorpus with tmmap not relevant right now led me to do some of the preprocessing work with the PCorpus option instead. And it takes hours. So I use R CMD BATCH to run a script doing things likep  precodegt  load corpus from predefined directory path, gt and create backend database to support processing gt bigCcorp  PCorpusbigCdir, readerControl  listloadFALSE, dbControl  listuseDb  TRUE, dbName  bigCdb, dbType  DB1  gt  converting to lower case gt bigCcorp  tmmapbigCcorp, tolower  gt  removing stopwords gt stoppedCcorp  tmmapbigCcorp, removeWords, stoplist codepre  pNow, supposing my script crashes soon after this point, or I just forget to export the corpus in some other form, and then I restart R. The database is still there on my hard drive, full of nicely tidiedup data. Surely I can reload it back into the new R session, to carry on with the corpus processing, instead of starting all over againp  pIt feels like a noodle question... but no amount of dbInit or dbLoad or variations on the PCorpus function seem to work. Does anyone know the correct incantationp  pIve scoured all the related documentation, and every paper and web forum I can find, but total blank  nobody seems to have done it. Or have I missed itp

It is necessary to determine whether there is in the picture with the document or that stamp reference. Stamps can be rotated.p  pDoing a similar task with the usual etalons cartoon characters, finds good. But with stamps problem is probably due to the fact that they are very similar  all round.

Negative 29786 pHey guys so Ive been trying to decipher this problem for the last hour right now and having some trouble here. This is the problemp  blockquote   pThis method for calculating the square root of a number n starts by   making a non zero guess at the square root. It then uses the   original guess to calculate a new guess, according to the formulap  precodenewGuess  n  oldGuess  oldGuess  2.0 codepre      pHave two variables codeoldGuesscode and codenewGuesscode. Initialize codeoldGuesscode to   coden  2.0code and calculate codenewGuesscode according to the above formula. Use   a while loop to iterate as long as the absolute value of the   difference between the codeoldGuesscode and codenewGuesscode is greater than   code1.0E06code. Do not forget to reset the value of codeoldGuesscode to the   codenewGuesscode value in the while loop.p      pIn your program you will prompt the user to enter a positive number.   If the number is negative, print an error message and ask the user to   try again. For a positive number, calculate the square root using the   above method. Find the difference between the square root you obtained   and the value obtained from using the exponentiation operator. Write   out the value the user entered, the square root you computed, and the   difference your square root  coden  0.5codep blockquote  pThis is my program so far p  precodedef main     n  evalinputEnter a positive number      while n lt 0         print Error please reinput         n  evalinputEnter a positive number       oldGuess  n  2.0     newGuess  n  oldGuess  oldGuess  2.0     difference  n  n  0.5           while difference lt 1  10  6         print Error         difference  absn  n  0.5     print Difference, difference  main codepre  pSo I dont really understand how we can tell the program to make a guess and then calculate the square root of variable n. I dont even think my while statements are right in this context. I dont use the already embedded function the squareroot built into python so it has to be done manually I believe still lost on what it means by the guess function. p

SERVICEQNAME  new QNameservicesNamespace, SERVICENAME  I wrote this code quite some time ago, and at the time I wrote the comment below. Ive included it here in case it is helpful   The sample code creates an instance of the generated TheServiceService class.  TheServiceService has references to the local WSDL file that it was generated from, and  will report an error if it is not found. To prevent that error, we could  1 ensure that the WSDL is available locally in the production environment in the location      referenced in the generated Java  2 generate the Java from the WSDL located on the web rather than local WSDL, meaning that      the WSDL referenced in the generated Java would be a URL to where it is located on      serviceproviderss web site.  3 Rather than create an instance of TheServiceService, just create an instance of its      super class, javax.xml.ws.Service, which has a static method to create an instance of it that      does not require the location of the WSDL to be passed to it.  I am going to choose option 3. Option 2 is a close second.

The server sends back a path that should become the new codewindow.locationcode of the browser. So the ajax call wants to be something likep  precode.ajax     stuff     success function destination         other stuff       window.location  destination    ,      still more stuff  codepre  pThis works fine as long as codedestinationcode is a pure path, like codesomepathcode emandem if the browser is not currently on that page.  However, if the path emisem the page that Im currently on and also includes a target  codesomepathsometargetcode, I lose the browser simply repositions the page at the specified target, but does not hit the server for a fresh view of the page, which I need since the server has done some stuff during the ajax call.p  pSo, maybe I just add a codelocation.reloadcode after the codewindow.locationcode call  That would work when the code is running on the page to which its being returned, I think.  But if Im on another page, I get hit by a race condition, where the reload is called before the browser has finished making the codewindow.locationcode change, and I get the old page reloaded, not the new destination.p  pBlurgh.

Negative 29786 pI have an app that uses timers in conjunction with the UIImagePicker and sends the images to Parse. I am trying to find out the best way to go about setting my timers up. What I need is to be able to have the images uploaded to Parse but not be released to the recipients until a datetime specified by the user uploading the images. I need the images to still be released to the recipients even if the app is not open or the users phone is offbroken. Is there a way I can do this from a backend server like Parse or is there a way to set it up within the app itself so that the timer will still go off when the app isnt loaded New to development and just looking for the best way to achieve this thanksp

Negative 29786 pI have been running a largeish site for years, with a typical nginx  apache setup, and all the pages are modperl. Up until recently, I was running on FreeBSD. After a hardwarereplacement, and due to other reasons, I was forced to migrate to Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS, which I use on many other servers, so no big deal. However, I have a problem with my logs now. For some reason, more and more actions are no longer logged through Log4Perl. This was never a problem on my previous setup, but now I seem to lose between 2 and 15  of my logentries. This is checked and verified by logging the data to a database at the same time.p  pDoes anyone have a clue why this would happen Is there something I should know about large logfiles and ubuntu Its not that large tbh, 390 MB atm I get nothing in my errorlogs anywhere, and as the databaselogging happens AFTER the loginfoENTRY HERE, the script obviously doesnt crash. But I am missing a lot of those ENTRY HEREs  The log in question is hit about once per second on average, but I should not think this would be a big problem Could there be too many processes trying to write to the log in parallel, causing lockingissues, preventing data form being appended to the file Any typical Ubuntusettings that might be adjusted for something like thisp  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.p  ul liSpinnerli ul

Negative 29786 pI have several packages that are almost identical. Differ only by columns addedremoved in different database versions. When I copy a package and modify the data flow of the copy, I delete the OLE DB Data Source and add a new one. Once the new one is defined, its preview shows exactly what I expect. Columns, however, are from the OLE DB source that was deleted. Its like it is being cached somewhere.p  pSeems like I need to close the package and reopen it after removing the data source. Is there some other way to clear this cached state Whats going on internally that causes this to happenp  pMore... it looks like its the parametrized connection manager that is holding on to previous parameters until the package is closed and reopened.p

Negative 29786 pI need my Rails app to only allow users with admin to be able to access the signup page and add users. However, if someone is signed in admin or otherwise, Devise redirects them and displays the already signed in message bound to the alreadyauthenticated error.p  pI know there are other, more robust ways around this like creating a new controller to override the standard one in Devise, but because I am fairly new to Rails and my current needs are small I simply wanted to disable that alreadyauthenticated redirect entirely. Then, I could easily add an if statement to the top of the signup page to keep regular users out of it, but still let those with admin attributes pass. I could do the same with the signin page and start it with an if signedin query to see if a user is currently signed in and redirect as necessary on my own. Easy peasy I think.p  pIve been pouring through the Devise docs and their lib files but havent been able to locate exactly where this redirect is being handled, if that is indeed what its doing at all.p  pAny help is appreciated and thank you in advance.p
Negative 29786 pMy app allows users to format text in a UITextView by clicking some formatting buttons that apply attributes to the attributedText property of the text view. I want to allow users to copy their formatted text from one UITextView and paste it into another using the standard pasteboard and standard cutcopypaste menu.p  pCurrently if I copy formatted text from a UITextView and paste it into a new message in the Mail app, the formatting is preserved  so the copying of formatted text is happening automatically. But if I paste the formatted text into another UITextView in my app, only the plain text appears.p  pBy following the Pasting the Selection section in the a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationStringsTextFontsConceptualTextAndWebiPhoneOSUsingCopy,Cut,andPasteOperationsUsingCopy,Cut,andPasteOperations.htmlapplerefdocuidTP40009542CH11SW37 relnofollowText Programming Guide for iOSa, I was able to override the paste method of UITextView and intercept the pasted contentp  precode voidpasteidsender      UIPasteboard pasteboard  [UIPasteboard generalPasteboard]     NSLogtypes available , [pasteboard pasteboardTypes]     for NSString type in [pasteboard pasteboardTypes]          NSLogtype   , type, NSStringFromClass[[pasteboard valueForPasteboardTypetype] class], [pasteboard valueForPasteboardTypetype]       codepre  pThis shows me that the pasteboard contains content in the following formats com.apple.rtfd, public.rtf, public.text and Apple Web Archive pasteboard type.

Negative 29786 pWe are currently using Couchbase in a product not released but we are thinking of using Couchbase Lite in our test environment. However can we use com.couchbase.client.CouchbaseClient to do CRUD operations on Couchbase Litep  pI have googled it and read Couchbase Lite doc but I can not get any answers.p
Negative 29786 pIve searched as much as I could but did not find any answersexamples for my question.p  pIm completely new to Web UI development but have a decade and a half of experience in Java and other languages. I seem to be completely lost in the sea of available options for the client side, but for the server side I have a Rest server Play running already. I cant and dont want to use a complete package for both client and server bc I want to pass JSON back and forth between the server and the client. This way I can use multiple different clients web, Excel, Swing, etc. I want to keep it flexible like this. p  pSo far I pretty much decided to use GXT for the client side, and found RestyGWT to be sitting in the middle. This is what causes my problems. So far, I have not been able to find a single example of a GXT  RestyGWT combination. Just a single example a Grid for example would be extremely helpful, since I have no experience with J2EE, beans, or any of that. p  pAny help or examples with GXT  RestyGWT would be greatly appreciatedp

Negative 29786 pWe are planning to port our C inmemory DB app into Java.  We are looking to using Hazelcast as a inmemory DB solution in Java parlance.p  pThe required throughput from a system having 40TB of data is 30k reads and writes per sec. Since the amount of data in memory is large we cannot compromise on throughput once the system goes down.p  pAn in house implementation using C provides us a flexibility of storing this data in shared memory along with the disk storage. Once the application restarts we can recover it by attaching the process back to shared memory file. p  pCan we have a similar functionality available in Hazelcast as well Or is there some similar inmemory data grid solution where we can have this functionalityp

Negative 29786 pThis is a very detailed question about the logic operators , ampamp on C. Im using them in my code, but I doubt about this codep  precodebool filluppointerintsth if filluppointeramppointer  filluppointer2amppointer     return codepre  pfilluppointer returns true if something happened, so not always. My question is, if the first function returns true, will the second function in the if block be executed  is equal to the OR operator, so according to the specification both functions are executed consecutively and then the bools are compared. I just want to create such a structure that the entire if structure returns when encountering the first true function, and it is critical to stop then since I want that specific value in the pointer. Executing another function afterwards will change the value not in here, but in my real code it does.p

I want it to be stored in the iOS and Android AppStores, so just a webapp with mobileview option doesnt seem right to me. Now my question. Whats the best option to start with Create the webapp first to get the backend, databases and stuff and than write the native app that gets access to that databases Or start with native app first and just build a simple webapp that gets access to the native app backend Or maybe write the webapp with mobile view option and just write a simple native app that uses the UIWebView to show the mobile version of my webbapp I hope this question is not too confusingp  pP.S. I decided to go for ruby on rails for the webapp and store that stuff on amazon aws  P.S.2 How much is the UI of a native app customizable e.g. TableViews etc Because implementing WebApp via UIWebView may be the more stylish option greetzp

Negative 29786 pI have learned recently that anonymous functions can carry around large amounts of unused data, even if this data is created after the anonymous function is instantiated.

The above seems to suggest that codes.workspace1code will always contain the external variables and their values that the anonymous function actually uses. Meanwhile codes.workspace2code seems to contain updates to variables that came into scope embeforeem codefuncode was defined. Am I correct that these are the rules But if so, then why, in the above, does codes.workspace2code contain an update to b, but not to a and cp  pThese things seem important to understand, since obviously, I can end up carrying large amounts of unintended memory that was allocated after my anonymous function was created.p

I can still see the last repository opened.p  pSometimes, it doesnt show me a repository when I open this window, and then when I try to connect to the local VisualSVN repository, I get a message saying http10.0.0.1008080svnTestProject but no indication as to why it couldnt connect.p  pI can paste the same URL into a web browser, and after entering my user name and password, it shows me the repository.p  pI suspect that the problem is that the VisualSVN server requires a user name and password, but the AnkhSVN addin doesnt ask me for one. It did when I connected to beanstalk.p  pI found this SO post, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10358297howtosetusernamepasswordtoconnecttosubversionrepositoryinankhsvninvHow to set usernamepassword to connect to Subversion repository in AnkhSVN in Visual Studioa which suggests checking Tools  Options  Source Control  Subversion Environment  Authentication Cache, but that only shows the beanstalk one. If I delete that, I still cant connect to the local server, but can connect to beanstalk after entering my user name and password again.p  pI also checked in the Subversion folder under APPDATARoaming, but there wasnt anything in any of the four folders there.p  pAnyone any idea what I can do The addin prompts me for a user name and password when connecting to beanstalk, but not when connecting to the VisualSVN server.p

Negative 29786 pOk, so Im writing a Node class that is a container for a type Element. Im supposed to write a copy constructor to iterate through the links of Node classes and copy each node.p  pFor the Node class, the only variables are an Element the data contained and a pointer to the next node, and if there is no next node it will point to nullptr.p  pI understand I need to make a deep copy and make new nodes for each of the nodes pointed.p  pWhat I had was something like thisp  precode    NodeNodeconst Nodeamp rhs               elethe element  rhs.ele          next  rhs.next          Node cur  Nodeele          cur.next  next          whilecur.next  nullptr                         Node n  new Nodecur.ele               n.next  cur.next               cur  cur.next                    return this       codepre  pObviously this doesnt work at all. To my understanding, to keep the copies I need to store the new nodes on the heap and keep allocating new nodes until I hit the nullptr, but Im not sure how exactly to implement this. Thank youp

Negative 29786 pI have recently started reading Martin Fowlers Analysis Patterns in an attempt to improve my data modelling skills and I find the book really interesting and enlightening as far as objectoriented approaches are concerned. However, although I think I understand how most of the patterns would translate into a relational database schema, I fail to see how to implement them in a realistic way. p  pFor example, implementing the Measurement pattern chapter 3.4 in a non objectrelational database would requirep  ul li1 table to store Persons.li li1 table to store Measurements for a Person N1 relationship.li li1 table to store the Quantity of a Measurement 11 relationship.li li1 table to store the Phenomenon Types that may characterise a Measurement 1N relationship.li ul  pIn an RDBMS all this amounts to several sort operations to realise joins and to a large number of records that need to be joined, especially if were storing lots of Persons and lots of Measurements for each Person. I suspect it would not perform well.p  pThe question, I suppose, is whether I am correct in my suspicion and if someone could point me to the right direction in terms of books or other sources that discuss the implementation of such analysis patterns to relational databases.p  pThank you very much in advance, Nicop

Negative 29786 pSo I have CRM Online and SharePoint Online as document storage.  I have the list component installed and everything is working there.  I have a plugin I have built which generates emails, and as part of the process, grabs documents from various SharePoint folders and attaches the to the email before sending.p  pTo do this in a SharePoint online environment, I have to go out, grab a SAML token from MSs login STS service, pass the token to SharePoint, receive a couple of authentication cookies back, and pass those cookies along with any requests I make to SharePoint.  All of this is working.  The bad news is I have to have a username and password hardcoded in or prompt the user.

Because these tables gattung and art contain a lot of species names latin which one can choose I think about an eased editing feature.p  p1 Id like to generate an autocompletion when entering the first 3 characters into a line edit instead of a combo box for gattung so that on can choose only these species that beginns for example with Que from a list.p  p2 When Ive chosen a name that matches with these 3 characters for example Que for Quercus, in the second field art only valid names can be chosen. For example petrea ore robur as a subset of the whole artnames which one can choose. Valid names are Quercus robur or Quercus petrea. This could be done via line edit when entering 4 characters or with a combo box.p  pI thought about python and a lettercode Quepetr for Quercus petrea to solve this but doesnt know where to start and also where to enter the code for the widgets in QTDesigner.p  pIm grateful for any help or ideap

Negative 29786 pThis is my first attempt at creating a custom ASP.NET control and Ive almost cracked it, but am falling at the final hurdle.p  pIve created a custom control which inherits from the Button class.  Ive overridden the Render method because I want to add styling to the button, which obviously goes in the buttons parent tag, thus precluding use of RenderContent or RenderChildren as I understand it.  That part all works perfectly.p  pThe problem is that in overriding the Render method I have obviously omitted something which is in the default Render method which allows the code in the OnClick method Ive written to be fired.  If I simply comment out my overridden Render method and build the solution the button works perfectly aside from the styling.  I have tried including codeMyBase.Renderwritercode in my overridden Render method, but that appears to mess things up more, acting more as if my code in my Render method was in the RenderContent method.p  pSo, I can either have the button look exactly as I want it but not function, or function perfectly but look wrong.

Negative 29786 pIve searched stackoverflow for an answer to this question, but I couldnt find one or I didnt understand the answers well enough to know that my question has been answered, so please accept my apologies if the later is the case.p  pYou can see an example of the site that Im working on at a hrefhttpwww.bcgsc.cadownloadsbdavistempsite relnofollowhttpwww.bcgsc.cadownloadsbdavistempsitea.p  pWhat I would like to be able to do is have an onHover or onClick or ideally both, each resulting in a different action for the row names.  You can see an example of this functionality by looking at the column headers.  If you allow your mouse cursor to hover on the column header H3K4me3 for example it will bring up a brief description of what that is, and if you click on it it will open up a web page where I will place content in greater depth about it.  I would like to be able to recreate this functionality for the rows headers e.g. CD19 cell.  p  pAt the moment, the website populates the grid by reading a data.xml file which specifies enough information to display the values contained in the grid, and provide the information to the back end of the system so that when a user clicks on View in UCSC browser that the correct information is transmitted.  A CDATA tag is used in the data.xml file, a brief example of which is pasted below.p  precodeltcellgtlt[CDATA[ Blood]]gtltcellgt codepre  pThe way I had conceived of achieving this functionality was to place some javascript  html within the CDATA object, but obviously that wont work because its CDATA, so its not parsed, but replacing CDATA with PCDATA causes the backend to break I dont know why and the table doesnt get filled in at all.  Ive even tried simply replacing the entire CDATA snippet with just an stuff, but thats not processed by the web browser either, I imagine thats because of the way jqgrid is transmitting the data.p  pNote, that at the moment when you hover over the row names, you can see the contents of that cell.  So a reasonable strategy would for the onHover functionality be to dynamically change the title for that cell, or perhaps modify jqgrid in some way to allow it to set the cell contents to something different from the title attribute.p  pAn ideal solution would allow me to have both .hover functionality and .onClick style functionality, but I would be satisfied if I could only get the onClick to work. That is definitely the more important function. At the moment the cell does not have a unique id, but the row does.  p  pSo, can anyone help me or provide some directions to look in. p  pThanks, Brad Davisp

The main application and each plugins references an third assembly that only contains a class interface for emsafecastem in the loadreflection step. This assembly builds to the same folder that the main app and all the plugins.p  pThe problem is when I executedebug F5 the application inside Visual Studio, everything works fine. Also, when the app is executed outside VS, it works OK too. But, when the app is executed on a PC without VS, I got the following error strongCould not load file or assembly PluginInterface.dll or one of its dependencies. The specified module could not be foundstrong. p  pThe error seems to happen when the plugin assemblies are first loaded AssemblyLoadFromfilename in the main application. Cant be sure, since as I said, the computers where the error occur, dont have VS installed for debugging, or else the error does not occur. This point is the very first use of those assemblies in the application.p  pThe deployment PCs all have .NET 4.0 and the VC redist installed.p  pWhy is this happening What can i do As you can see, this problem is holding the deployment.p

Negative 29786 pI am a programmer, and I am lazy. Currently I am working with some OpenAL wrappers in C. Every time I call an OpenAL method, I have to request the error from OpenAL using codeGetErrorcode and if there is one, I throw an exception. It didnt take long until I added a static helper class containing the following functionp  precode    public static void Check              ALError error         if error  AL.GetError  ALError.NoError             throw new InvalidOperationExceptionAL.GetErrorStringerror      codepre  pThis worked for a while, but I wanted more. So, after a while, I came up with the following methodsp  precode    public static void CallAction function              function         ALHelper.Check           public static void CallltTParametergtActionltTParametergt function, TParameter parameter              functionparameter         ALHelper.Check           public static TReturn EvalltTReturngtFuncltTReturngt function              var val  function         ALHelper.Check         return val           public static TReturn EvalltTParameter, TReturngtFuncltTParameter, TReturngt function, TParameter parameter              var val  functionparameter         ALHelper.Check         return val      codepre  pThis worked great, but I was still not happy with how exactly the code looked when used, so I decided to take it one step further I turned the above methods into extension methods. As I knew I could pass methods as the codeActioncode and codeFunccode parameters, I thought it would work as well for extension methods, turning the ugly codehandles  ALHelper.EvalAL.GenBuffers, amountcode into a more elegant codehandles  AL.GenBuffers.Evalamountcode.p  pSadly, I was welcomed with an exception once I started using this Expression denotes a codemethod group, where acodevariable, codevalue orcodetype was expected.p  pSomewhat saddened that this doesnt work, I actually got curious as to why this wouldnt work. What exactly is the reason you can pass a method as codeActioncode or codeFunccode, but using extension methods doesnt work Is this a limitation of the Mono compiler I am using .NET 4.0 I am using, or is there something else going on insidep

Negative 29786 pI am developing a mobile cross platform game iOS, Android, WP8 using MonoGame amp Xamarin. I have a class called PlayerData that holds data such as high score and other stats.

Negative 29786 pMy tool actually rewrites the host file based on a few options and those values are used to do things like communicate with one of several databases via dns, but the problem is that in a different area of the tool, I need to use the current value of the host file. Unfortunately, it seems that the values that are present when the app is first run are all that get used.p  pIve tried flushing dns, but it doesnt seem to have any effect. The methods Ive tried arep  ul liSetting timeoutli ul  pcodeServicePointManager.DnsRefreshTimeout  0code  this actually broke everything. I wasnt able to communicate with the database at all.p  ul lipImportingp  precode[DllImportdnsapi.dll,EntryPointDnsFlushResolverCache] private static extern UInt32 DnsFlushResolverCache  codepreli ul  pThis didnt seem to have any effect.p  pHow do I ensure that my application is using the current values of my host filep  pUPDATE To be clear, I am not reading the host file in order to use it. The IPs get changed, but the app uses the host name when trying connect to the database. e.g.p  ul licode127.1.1.14 MyDatabasecode   is in the host file, the app tries to talk to codeMyDatabasecodeli liApp changes the host file to read code127.1.1.16 MyDatabasecode, the app tries to talk to codeMyDatabasecode, but it should resolve to .16, but instead it still resolves to .14li ul  pThis seems to only affect the app which makes me think that its caching the DNS the first time it resolves it i.e. the first time it talks to the database which is why I tried flushing the dns in the ways outlined above, without success. If I open command prompt and codeping MyDatabase 4code then I see the correct IP address resolve. I use my app to change the host files IP address for that host, then codeping MyDatabase 4code, and it shows the correct updated IP, so like I said, I think its the app that is caching it.p

Negative 29786 pWere a small organization that uses github. We have a pretty simple workflow feature and fix branches are made off of origindevelop, and pull requests are opened back onto develop when the developer thinks the branch is ready to be merged. We then do code review and QA. p  pThis often means that there are three or four open PRs at a time, and theres a 15 day lag between when a PR is opened and when it is approved by the team and merged into develop.p  pLocally, Ive started keeping a future branch, which is basically just develop  any open PRs. This lets me have my own nightly build be as complete as possible, and lets me catch possible conflicts a bit earlier. p  pSo Im interested in making this codefuturecode branch available to the rest of the team. I can see this getting a bit complicated, though currently, if a PR is closed, I just nuke my local branch and then rebuild again from develop. This is super easy. It gets a little more complicated, though, if other people have their own local copies. I can always forcepush my own working copy back up to origin, but then there will be conflicts for people who check it out.p  pIdeally, I could have some sort of virtual branch, that just offered an uptodate snapshot of the code base at a given time, and which people could just sort of update and build.p  pDoes anything like this exist Is there some other way of getting the sort of functionality Im talking about p

Negative 29786 pIve made a simple home screen widget which has two TextView fields and a refresh button. TextViews are loaded from AsyncTask which downloads and parses small XML file. The refresh button calls onUpdate again using PendingIntent, and eventually AsyncTask again. I have a simple model class XMLValues which can store parsed values from the XML and which is initialized in the AppWidgetProvider classp  precodepublic class XmlValues  private int mFieldValue1  public int getFieldValue1      return mFieldValue1  public void setFieldValue1int FieldValue      mFieldValue1  FieldValue  private int mFieldValue2  public int getFieldValue2      return mFieldValue2  public void setFieldValue2int FieldValue      mFieldValue2  FieldValue  codepre  pp  pIn AsyncTask I pass in it RemoteViews views, int appWidgetID, AppWidgetManager appWidgetManager where the XML is downloaded and parsed, the postExecute method looks something like thisp  precodeprotected void onPostExecuteXmlValues xv         if isCancelled             xv  null                 views.setTextViewTextR.id.textView1, xv.getFieldValue1        views.setTextViewTextR.id.textView2, xv.getFieldValue1        WidgetManager.updateAppWidgetWidgetID, views       codepre  pThis all works I load the TextViews with correct values, however I am stuck trying to do the following  since the XML values that I am parsing can potentially change, I would like for example to change the color of the TextViews if the new values that come from the new XML are larger then the current ones in the widget. How can I achieve this I tried looking around but didnt manage to find how to affect the model class object created in the main widget class, from the onPostExecute method from AsyncTask.p

Negative 29786 pWe have some access databases executed via runtime that are using Office 2010 x86.

Normally i would keep my model in session scope and have some managed beans and controllers in request scope that access the model. But this is not possible because with one browser i have only one session, and so i can only have one model. Here i thought the JSF 2.2 Flowscope would help me, because i can put each model into a flow and i hope that this would work perfectly as if i have a session for every model.

I started topics on GSAP forum and CSS tricks forumstackoverflow.com is limiting me to post only 2 links as a newcomer.p  pI used GSAP JS library for animatinggenerally very happy with GSAP but animation behaves the same if I use CSS3 to animate. I concluded that it is not related to GSAPviewbox size property seems to have little bit of effect here , more likely to be related to SVG structure itself or browser compatibility or both. So I guess there must be some work around to make it work like I would like to. I most likely lack some SVGHTMLCSS3 knowledge since I am not very experienced but trying to learn as much as I can.

Negative 29786 pI want only trusted devices to connect to my peripheral. And I dont want anyone to be able to discover services and characteristics of my peripheral. So before connecting to the peripheral I would like to show an alert with a pin code. Is it possible to do it and what is the easiest wayp  pI couldnt find the answer to this question and tried to implement encrypted characteristic by adding CBAttributePermissionsWriteEncryptionRequired to the permissionsp  precodeself.characteristic  [[CBMutableCharacteristic alloc] initWithType[JUUIDBuilder uuidWith1706]                                                          properties CBCharacteristicPropertyWrite                                                               valuenil permissionsCBAttributePermissionsWriteEncryptionRequired] codepre  pFor some reason it didnt help because Im able to write values from my second device all the time without any security checks.

Negative 29786 pI have a Rails 4 app that I am using to track if a product, in this case the product refers to Badges, that uses a uniquely generated QR Code to identify if the badge is legitimate and not counterfeit.

I have heard that gzip at least thats what I think it was called can do this job quite well, but it has issues with Heroku. If this is the case then is there another compressor that I can use to compress this folderli liHow can I actually get the User to download the compressed folder I have tried codesendfile publiccodesout, xsendfilegttruecode, but unfortunately I cant send it like this because it isnt compressed.li ol  pIf it helps at all, these QR Codes are all just simple PNGs, I have tried using Dragonfly and looked at Paperclip, but wasnt sure if either was actually useful for getting an entire directory downloaded at once like this.p

Negative 29786 pDidnt really know what title to give this question so I hope its acceptable.p  pI am using a system which has an API.  I dont have a lot of control over this system, but one thing I need for security reasons is for it to be locked down to my IP.  This works, so now the system can only be accessed from my IP.p  pNow, I have built a custom app which uses the above API.  This app is hosted on a server which is different from my IP address.  Therefore, when I try to make the API call it fails due to it being restricted.  I know this is the case, because if I run the app locally from my location, it works without any problems.p  pSo, the question is whats the best thing to do  I know I could add the IP address of the server which is hosting my app to the systems API.  However, I think the servers IP is dynamic which could cause problems.  I have also used things like noip locally to control my dynamic IP, but I cant imagine I can install this on my web server.p  pLooking for thoughts as to how I can overcome this problem.p  pThanks p

Negative 29786 pFirst Time Posting here. I am New to Access and Have learned a lot regarding access but I still consider myself a novice as I am not comfortable writing codes, modules, or VBA. p  pHowever, I am Using Allen Brownes Module to perform A concaterelated function, however i keep getting various syntax errors.p  pHere is what i am working with and trying to accomplish I am working with three columns from an ODBC Database table. CustomerNumber, CustomerName, and YtdDollarSales. The CustomerNumbers are comprised of a main account number and each account number has a job id ex main acct1234, job id1234.001. Many customers have multiple job id numbers. Each time we receive payment from a customer that has multiple Job id s, that payment goes under the job id and not the main acct. So im trying to use a concatrelated function to combine the account s with the job id with the end goal to get a single YTD sales report per customer that includes all of their job ids.p  pI figured that the best way to start is by combining the CustomerNumber with the CustomerName. I have the following in the query field p  pConcatRelatedCustomerNumber,davecCM1,CustomerName   amp [CustomerName]p  pHowever when i run this, i get a variety of syntax errors claiming that it is missing operators i.e. error 3075 Syntax error missing Operator In Query expression CustomerName  CASH SALE C.p  pIm assuming that it is something in the Module that doesnt compensate for parenthesis or backslashes in the cells. But I dont know. p  pIf anyone can help me out with this, Itd be Really great.p

Negative 29786 pI have WPF Window and inside it DataGrid which Items Source is set to BindingList collection in my data context. DataGrid and bindings works just fine, items show up and remove how I change my model. Have also hooked up handler for ListChanged event of BindingList collection in model. Then we can compare model with already persisted data while user types in items in DataGrid and then enable save button if model is updated. Also have validation rules for items in DataGrid. For example, when user enters invalid characters for name, items gets red marking. We then also just disable save.p  pBut now I have new requirement to check if there are multiple items in DataGrid with identical names and to mark them in DataGrid with red color  also while user types in items. p  pAs model already implements IDataErrorInfo, I can easily find that duplicates do exist in collection in model. But how can I mark just that items with duplicated names in DataGrid As I understand, this is in a way validation first of the group DataGrid and then marking of specific items based on that rule, but Im completely blocked as have no idea how to implement it properly in MVVM and WPF...p

Negative 29786 pWhen merging two tables in PowerQuery an evaulation is run to determine the possible number of matches. I run pretty large tables merge a 10K record table with a 500K record table so this can take a long time.p  pI know there will be matches because I have done this before and I am not a beginner.

But I am not sure what is emexactlyem going on with this line of code.li liGiven that codeifstrcode is an equivalent statement to codeifstr  NULLcode, what would you pass into a function to make codestr  NULLcode For example, in my codemaincode, I tried to do codechar str[]  NULLcode, thereby, attempting to pass a NULL so that it wouldnt go inside the code codeifstr  NULLcode. But I get an error saying I cannot make this declaration codechar str[]  NULLcode. So my question is why am I getting this error and what can I pass through the codereversecode function in order to make the code inside of codeifstrcode not execute I hope this question made sense. li liAnd the code codeendcode is doing pointer arithmetic correct So every time it is incremented, the address is moving to the address right next to itli liIm a little confused codewhilestr lt endcode. What is the difference between just codestrcode and codestrcode I understand that codecout ltlt str ltlt endlcode has to do with overloading the operator codeltltcode and therefore prints the entire string that is passed through the argument. But why, when I codecout ltlt end ltlt endlcode, it only prints the character at that memory address So my question is, whats the difference between the two Is it just dereferencing when i do codestrcode I might actually be asking more than that question in this question. I hope I dont confuse you guys lt. li ol

Negative 29786 pI saw a few blog articles saying that AngularJS and jQuery could be used together in one app. That seems good as jQuery has some functionalities Angular doesnt have and Angular allows us to make a greatly structured logic for a web app.p  pThe fact is, as Im french I also take a look at french blog articles about that, and french tends to say that we should never use jQuery and Angular together. I asked why on a forum and people said that its probably because beginners usually use jQuery and Angular for the same things  adding elements dynamically, use ajax requests, etc... But Id like to use jQuery for some things Angular does not do and to allow bootstrap js to work on my app.p  pWhat do you think, are jQuery and Angular bad at working together in one single app Or does it just depend on how we make them work togetherp

Everything works fine until  toggleoff some columns and change page. Then columns which should be hidden are not mentioned in datatable header this is ok, but data are still here. So datatable header is shorter than rest of datatable and columns do not shown under their headers. Primefaces version is 5.2.p  pDid someone face the same problem What do you recommend to trycheckp  pExamplep  pLets say that we i have table with 5 columns.p  ol liIdli liColorli liNameli liTypeli liPriceli ol  pIn this table is about 100 records. One page shows 10 records so we have 10 pages. When we use ColumnToggler and toggleoff price and type column. This will cause that these two columns will disappear. Problem occures if we choose different page via Paginator or just try change number of records showed on one page. After these operation i will get broken table. Header of table will contains only first 3 columns Id,Color,Name. This is ok, because last two columns should be hidden. So table header is filtered well. Problem is that table body contains all columns so also columns for Type and Price.p  pUnfortunatelly i can not provide screenshots because of character of data.p

How can I calculate similarity between these Which metric should I usep  pUPDATE numbers represent vote from 1 to 10. Users vote items in one specific category. We dont know items they have been voted. We only know that these items are belong to the same category. So we have arrays of votes in category. The problem is how we could calculate similarity between these users. p

Negative 29786 pIm going through the Head First Java book and Im currently at the chapter where you build a BeatBox drum machine. The BeatBox imports its MIDI sounds from javax.sound.midi., and the thing Im having difficulty figuring out is why the MIDIs sound different on Linux Mint than they do on Windows 8.1. When I pack the 16 instrument MIDI BeatBox into a .jar and run it on Linux Mint there are only about 5 actual instrument sounds. You can select different instruments to play back, its just that most of them will sound like a bass drum. For instance, if you select a whistle, it will sound like a bass drum on Linux Mint whereas when the same .jar is ran on Windows 8.1 all 16 instruments are represented accurately a whistle sounds like a whistle.p  pIs there a difference between the way Windows 8.1 and Linux Mint handle MIDIs in Java programs p

Here is the link.p  pa hrefhttpswww.youtube.comwatchvMwmnzZXS1EA relnofollowhttpswww.youtube.comwatchvMwmnzZXS1EAap  pIf you click the link, you can see a link of Facebook page.p  pI could get the code of this video from Facebook page.p  precode Include required libraries include ltAdafruitCC3000.hgt include ltSPI.hgt   These are the interrupt and control pins define ADAFRUITCC3000IRQ   3 define ADAFRUITCC3000VBAT  5 define ADAFRUITCC3000CS    10   Use hardware SPI for the remaining pins  On an UNO, SCK  13, MISO  12, and MOSI  11 AdafruitCC3000 cc3000  AdafruitCC3000ADAFRUITCC3000CS, ADAFRUITCC3000IRQ, ADAFRUITCC3000VBAT, SPICLOCKDIV2  you can change this clock speed  define WLANSSID nobuka  cannot be longer than 32 characters define WLANPASS fkaakzx59   Security can be WLANSECUNSEC, WLANSECWEP, WLANSECWPA or WLANSECWPA2 define WLANSECURITY WLANSECWPA2  define LISTENPORT 80  What TCP port to listen on for connections.   The HTTP protocol uses port 80 by default. define MAXACTION 10  Maximum length of the HTTP action that can be parsed. define MAXPATH 64  Maximum length of the HTTP request path that can be parsed.   There isnt much memory available so keep this short define BUFFERSIZE MAXACTION  MAXPATH  20  Size of buffer for incoming request data.  Since only the first line is parsed this  needs to be as large as the maximum action  and path plus a little for whitespace and   HTTP version. define TIMEOUTMS 500  Amount of time in milliseconds to wait for  an incoming request to finish.

Negative 29786 pI have an input box in the GUI in VisionWorks. The input is treated as a codeValueHoldercode that holds the string I want to traverse and whatnot, but I cant seem to get to that value. Any ideasp
