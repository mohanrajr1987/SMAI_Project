Positive 27066 pI am Superdadsuper an Administrator and Bureaucrat on a hrefhttpbible.wikia.com relnofollowBiblicalapediaa a wikibased website about the Bible. I am not very keen in JavaScript and so am looking for some help in adding a feature.p  pBeing a website about the Bible and a wiki, its extremely important to attribute all of our content to the ultimate source the Bible. Over the years we have tried different systems in order to cite these, but none of them have matched with our needs. Rather then containing inline Bible verses Gen 11 we have all verses footnoted in the bottom using our CMSS MediaWiki reference system. I have finally found a feature that is highly customizable and automatically links all Bible verse cites and allows you to preview the verse with a hover this is called a hrefhttpreftagger.com relnofollowreftaggera.p  pAs I mentioned we are hosted on MediaWiki. Reftagger does provide some documentation on adding it to MediaWiki but does not apply because of the type of hosting we use and we have not been given that level of access to the system. Out of the system settings we do have access to, I have attempted adding it to [cite references link one][3], the file that allows customizing of the reference feature. This did not work as it just repost the code for every reference and I tried adding to the common.js file the file that allows you to custom the site with JavaScript I would link these files but cannot due to my amount of reputation points, but this still didnt work. I have tried many onwikia resources and recieved no help even consulted logos and received no aide.  I also saw something that it needs to be added right before the end body tag for it to work. Common.js embeds before that. I am wondering if that is the issue and if so could someone provide a code that appends my script following below to directly before the end tag. If not those who are familiar with MediaWiki or able able to do research if they had any idea of how I could get this to work My script as follows generated from reftaggers websitep  precodeltscriptgt     var refTagger               settings                    bibleVersion NIV   ,                                       roundCorners true,                     socialSharing [twitter,facebook,google],                     tooltipStyle dark,                     customStyle                               heading                                      backgroundColor  611e03,                                     fontFamily  Verdana, Geneva, sansserif                             ,                             body                                         color  f5f5f5,                                     fontFamily  TimesNewRoman, Times New Roman, Times, Baskerville, Georgia, serif,                                     moreLink                                               color 006cb0                                                                                                              functiond, t              var g  d.createElementt, s  d.getElementsByTagNamet[0]             g.src  api.reftagger.comv2RefTagger.js             s.parentNode.insertBeforeg, s     document, script codepre  p Please note the script tags will probably need to be taken out for it to work on a js file. The source is located at the g.src url that is provided. Another cause for the issue may be that the script wasnt designed to be done in the ol tag or more specifically with the class references. If this is the issue again please provide a fix. I am a little but frustrated with my lack of aide and would really like to get this rolling out on my site. By adding this feature you are helping Biblicalapedia take the next step and further centering our focus of the source of the content on the Bible itself. Whether you are Christian or not I would extremely appreciate anyone who helps me and would like them to be aware that they are aiding in our essential part of our ministryp  pThanks,  Superdadsuper, Biblicalapedia Administrator and Bureaucratp

Positive 27066 pOne of PHPs biggest advantages , is that because its interpreted and not compiled , you can fetch from the DB an entity with a dynamic composition of attributesproperties and can refer to them in code as if they were static getterssetters p  precodeperson  thisgtgetPerson persongtgetN1 ... ... ... ... persongtgetNn codepre  pWhere getN1...getNn were not declared for the person class at all .p  pThis enables the language to be very efficient in working infront of dynamic DBs and be used in CMSs  where virtually nothing is known about the received entity , as the user configureddeclared it his own via the ADMIN backend .p  pCan this advantage and behavior be replicated in Java without working with dictionariescollections , which defacto make you give away most of the basic language getset syntax and object handling and stay with the dictionary.keyexist  dictioanry.get syntax through out the entire system  which is perhaps more error prone then dynamic language just think of all the constantsreadonly you need to declare when accessing the entity dictionary fields if you want it to be best practiced .p  pIf not , would you suggest that PHP is simply more suitable for CMSs , where the user can configure the entities himself  p  pThank you,p  pJamesp

Positive 27066 pI am looking for a solid CMS that can be used locally on my Desktop. It could be something like Docfetcher a hrefhttpsourceforge.netprojectsdocfetcher relnofollowhttpsourceforge.netprojectsdocfetchera, only with some additional CMS features like Custom Meta Data Preview Functionality Tagsp  pIt should not be run on top of an application server, like embedded Jetty etc  chances are you would just run into trouble accessing the app due to Firewall constraints, Proxies, AntiVirus software and what not. Plus there does not need an ongoing process for serving requests, the only thing that should be ongoing is file indexing like it is the case for DocFetcher.p  pIs there something I would imagine it could be written in Java like DocFetcher and hence work on any OS.p  pThanks z4cp
Positive 27066 pWe are using umbraco 7.1.3p  pAs per clients requirement we need to create more then 550 Umbraco CMS sites for different cities with same template and asp.net user control which access data from one master database.p  pSo we created one windows application that will create 550 sites as per city name under one NonUmbraco root site.

Positive 27066 pI would like to aggregate posts from different already existing blogs on my website. I want to show blog title and number of comments.

Positive 27066 pI dont know how to properly format this question. Looking on S.O. I saw remotely similar problems that did not get a real response.p  pHere is what I am trying to do. I have a project that requires one page home page if you will for every census district in the continental United States. It requires these at the state, county and local levels.p  pI have a MySql list of these geographies that I believe would be more effective to use than clunky lists inserted into html. Perhaps adding a code to each entry for identificationp  pThe Problem Yes I can template the html and css with simple PHP. That only requires less than 12 dozen designs. But, If I use an MVC...do I really have to hand code 10s of thousands of routes to generate the urls Or would a cms be more appropriatep  pTo make this problem EVEN better. Each page will have links to data RELEVANT to each location. One example of some of these would be collecting data from my adjacent jurisdictions list and posting on the appropriate page with links.p  pI KNOW they say do NOT put code in your MySQL database but considering the second problem wouldnt it be logical to actually include the urls IN THE DATABASEp  pI know this can be done programmatically, I just can not visualize the construct at all of how this is even remotely achievable.p  pThere is NO chatter on google about this. Ive spent an obscene amount of time looking. But I fear, ultimately, it has more to do with the fact that I dont know how to phrase the question to get an honest response. I would call it dynamic but everytime someone uses that term they get 100 responses to look up the definition of dynamic. So.. that much I HAVE learned, not to call anything in any form for any reason at any time dynamic. You will just be flamed and ridiculed. I dont even use the nomenclature. No point.p  pBOTTOMLINE I feel like I can see the engine, but I cant visualize the camshaft driving it. Is this foolishp  pOf note Some of the online resources I had hoped on giving proper guidance and solution to this unique problem are cursed with affliction of age. The info is just too old to apply to a living language that has moved on. Ill waste too much attention focusingdebugging depreciated code examples rather than focusing on clean examples introducing new or new to me methods.p  pI think the scope of the project is what is throwing me. I am spinning thinking I need a tank when a garden trowel will probably do. Hmmm...p  pThanks in advance for any insite. Apologies for the length of the post. But I wanted to be crystal clear on my objective since I am lacking the proper terminology to classify the problem.p  pCan I automagically create large volumes of urls based on a known geographic list. Can I automagically populate the templates that live in those urls with links to more pages and create urls for them. The text for these links will be the same general topics but obviously the urls will be relevant to the pagegeography to which they reside.p

Negative 27066 pIve inherited a body of Visual C source that consists of about a dozen subprojects.  One of these is an empty MakeAll project that depends on all the others, so I can build the entire project by setting the MakeAll project active and selecting Build All.p  pId like to automate this process, and coming from a linux environment, my instinct was to generate a Makefile and build from the command line.  The IDE will generate code.makcode files for each of the subprojects, but not for the toplevel MakeAll.

It basically does long division the way youd do it by hand.p  precode    Public Function MyModByVal numberString As String, ByVal modby As Integer As Integer         Dim position As Integer  1         Dim curSubtraction As Integer  0          While position lt numberString.Length  1             position  1             curSubtraction  curSubtraction  10  CIntnumberString.Substringposition, 1              If curSubtraction  modby lt 1 And position  numberString.Length  1 Then                 Return curSubtraction             ElseIf curSubtraction  modby lt 1 Then                 Continue While             Else                 curSubtraction  curSubtraction Mod modby             End If         End While         Return curSubtraction     End Function codepre  pIs there a cleaner, more efficient wayp  pEDIT To clarify, the integers are coming from IBAN bank account numbers.  According to the specification, you have to convert the IBAN account number containing letters into one integer.  Then, you do a modulus on the integer.  So, I guess you could say that the real source of the integer to perform the modulus on is a string of digits.p

Negative 27066 pSo we ran into an interesting issue today. We have a Java EE web app that uses a bunch of 3rd party jars. This includes Hibernate.p  pWe use the Java logging api that comes with the SDK for logging purposes. Typically we are pretty thin on logging but we ran into this issue with one of our 3rd party jars using log4j to create its own log file. Not only was it logging statements from its own code, it even started writing out debugs for the hibernate code which resulted in a batch job logging 3 GB worth of logs in no time.p  pI have 2 issues with thisp  ol liI need to fix this logging issue If possible I do not wish to yank out or modify the log4j config in the 3rd party jar. Is there a good way to do this besides modifying or yanking out the log4j config in the 3rd party jar OR by having my own log4j config that overrides the config in the 3rd party jar I do not like either of the 2 options but I want to do whats best.li liI want to ask if it is kosher to expect 3rd party libraries to be logging away merrily I think this is bad design. I want to get the communitys opinion on this.li ol  pI want the 3rd party libraries logging ERRORs. That being said I think it is slightly awkward that this 3rd party jar to log DEBUGs from packages other than the ones it is responsible for. e.g. in my case, this 3rd party jar is logging Hibernate debugs even though it does not even call any hibernate methods. The batch job that we ran did not even call the API in this jar. It looks like having my own log4j config override whats in there seems to be the best way to go. p

Negative 27066 pIm struggling to understand the ViewModel part of the strongMVVM patternstrong. My current approach is to have a class, with no logic whatsoever important, except that it implements strongINotifyPropertyChangedstrong. The class is just a collection of properties, a struct if you like, describing an as small part of the data as possible. I consider this my strongModelstrong.p  pMost of the WPF code I write are settings dialogs that configure said Model. The codebehind of the dialog exposes a property which returns an instance of the Model. In the XAML code I bind to subproperties of that property, thereby binding directly to the Models properties. Which works quite well since it implements the INotifyPropertyChanged. I consider this settings dialog the strongViewstrong.p  pHowever, I havent really been able to figure out what in all this is the ViewModel. The articles Ive read suggests that the ViewModel should tie the View and the Model together, providing the logic the Model lacks but is still to complex to go directly into the View. Is this correct Would, in my example, the codebehind of the settings dialog be considered the strongViewModelstrongp  pI just feel a bit lost and would like my peers to debunk some of my assumptions. Am I completely off track herep

Negative 27066 pI have got a dll that I load in my program which reads and writes its settings to the registry hkcu. My program changes these settings prior to loading the dll so it uses the settings my program wants it to use which works fine.p  pUnfortunately I need to run several instances of my program with different settings for the dll. Now the approach I have used so far no longer works reliably because it is possible for one instance of the program to overwrite the settings that another instance just wrote before the dll has a chance to read them.p  pI havent got the source of the dll in question and I cannot ask the programmer who wrote it to change it.p  pOne idea I had, was to hook registry access functions and redirect them to a different branch of the registry which is specific to the instance of my program e.g. use the process id as part of the path. I think this should work but maybe you have got a different  more elegant.p  pIn case it matters I am using Delphi 2007 for my program, the dll is probably written in C or C.p

Negative 27066 pIm using Rails 2.3.8 and acceptsnestedattributesfor.p  pI have a simple category object which uses awesomenestedset to allow nested categories.p  pFor each category I would like a unique field called code.  This would be unique for the category per level.  Meaning parent categories will all have unique codes and sub categories will be unique within their own parent category.p  pEG p  precodecode name 1    cat1    1 sub cat 1 2    cat2    1 sub cat 1    2 sub cat 2 3    cat3    1 sub1 codepre  pThis works without the validation process but when I try and use something like validatesuniquenessof code, scope  parentidp  pThat will not work because the parent has not been saved yet.p  pHere is my modelp  precodeclass Category lt ActiveRecordBase   actsasnestedset   acceptsnestedattributesfor children, rejectif gt lambda  a a[name].blank , allowdestroy gt true    defaultscope order gt lft    validatespresenceof code, name, ischild   validatesuniquenessof code, scope gt parentid end codepre  pI have thought of a different way to do this and its very close to working, problem is I cannot check for uniqueness between child categories.  p  pIn this second example Ive embedded a hidden field in the form called ischild to flag if the item is a sub category or not.  Here is my example of this modelp  precodeclass Category lt ActiveRecordBase   actsasnestedset   acceptsnestedattributesfor children, rejectif gt lambda  a a[name].blank , allowdestroy gt true    defaultscope order gt lft    validatespresenceof code, name, ischild   validatesuniquenessof code, scope gt parentid   validate hasuniquecode    attraccessor ischild     private    def hasuniquecode      if self.ischild  1        Check here if the code has already been taken this will only work for         updating existing children.     else         Check code relating to other parents       result  Category.findbycodeself.code, conditions gt  parentid gt nil        if result.nil         true       else         errors.addcode, Duplicate found         false       end     end   end end codepre  pThis is very close.  If there was a way to detect duplicate codes in the rejectif syntax under acceptsnestedattributesfor then I would be there.  This all seems over complicated though and would like suggestions to make it easier.  We would like to keep adding categories and sub categories in the one form as it speeds up data entry.p  pstrongUpdatestrong Maybe I should be using build or beforesave.p

Negative 27066 pIn my spare time, Ive been taking code Ive written for various purposes and appropriating them into other languages just to have a look at whats out there. Currently Im taking a genetic programming graph colouring algorithm, originally written in Java, and trying to coerce it into C.p  pThe arbitrary data structure Im using for the task has a few classes. In Java, it wasnt so much of an issue for me because I had been exposed to it for a while. The graph structure was only created once, and a codeColouringcode was assigned to that. The codeColouringcode specifically finding a mostly optimal one was the real point of the code. I could have a codeGraphcode class with inner classes like codeNodecode and codeEdgecode, for instance, or I could have a package codegraphcode with classes codeGraphcode, codeNodecode, codeEdgecode, etc.p  pThe first case above might lend itself well to my idea of C. A main .cpp file might have some classes codeNodecode, codeGraphcode, codeEdgecode, defined in it. But this seems to really be missing the point of C, from what I can tell. Im just taking what I wrote in Java and emforcingem it into C, adding destructors where appropriate and turning object references to pointers. Im not yet emthinkingem in C. Do these classes bear separating into separate .cpp files Should they be separated, and then compiled as a library to use in the main program What I really need are some good resources or contrived examples or even rules of thumb to say, in C programming, what are the different options that exist and when is it a good idea to thinking about one over the otherp  hr  pEDIT Ive been asked by Pawel Zubrycki to provide some example code. Im not going to do this, because each component is fairly trivial  It generally has a reference to the next thing, and some getset methods. I will, however, describe it.p  pIts essentially an incidence list. There is some unnecessary use of classes termed code...Pointercode  they were a product of a literal translation of a diagram first used to explain incidence lists to me.p  pThere is a container class, codeVertexListcode, which contains a head element codeVertexPointercode, and methods to add new codeVertexPointercode objects Adding it to the graph, but not connecting it to any other nodes, allowing searches to search nonconnected graphs, naive search for indices on codeVertexcode objects, etc. Every codeVertexPointercode has a codeVertexcode object, as well as a codeVertexPointer nextcode, and all those handy codehasNextcode methods that you might expect. A codeVertexcode also has an associated codeConnectionListcodep  pThe same is duplicated for codeEdgeListcode, codeEdgePointercode, and codeEdgecode, except that an codeEdgecode is associated with two codeConnectioncode objects.p  pcodeConnectionListcode and codeConnectioncode codeConnectionListcode mimicking codeVertexListcode or codeEdgeListcode, having a codeConnection headcode and all those handy methods you might expect, like codeaddConnectioncode. A codeConnectioncode has an codeEdgecode associated with it, as well as some codeConnection nextcodep  pThis allows us to easily get the connected components of any one point in the graph, and have an arbitrary number of connections. p  hr  pIt seems pretty overthetop complicated, but the same functionality could be duplicated with some codeLinkedListcode of codeVertexcode objects, a codeLinkedListcode of codeEdgecode objects, and a number of codeLinkedListcode of codeConnectioncode objects. The codeLinkedListcode of codeVertexcode Objects allows us to iterate over all Vertices for exhaustive searches on Vertices, and the same applies for edges. The codeLinkedListcode objects of codeConnectioncode allow us to quickly traverse to any connected Vertices and to arbitrarily add or connections in the graph. This step up in complexity was added to deal with the complexity of evaluating a certain colouring of a graph weighted edges, quick traversal of local subgraphs, etc.p

Negative 27066 pI have a Javascript function bound to the click event of an INPUT element either checkbox or radio. That function examines the checked property of the DOM element and takes action depending upon whether it is set or not.p  pIf the user clicks on the element as represented in the GUI, the state of the checked property reflects the appearance in the GUI that is, if the users click activated the element, the checked property is true.p  pHowever, if I trigger the click event using jQuery, then, when the boundtotheclick function is invoked, examining the state of the checked property does NOT show the new state. However, the GUI does get updated to present proper representation of the actual state.p  pIs there a defined order to when these activities are performed It seems odd to me that the event listener would be invoked before the checked property is set. p

Negative 27066 pI have a few projects to maintain that use a lot of SQL Server stored procedures in TSQL. I know how to maintain them, but since there are many tools to automatically convert between different languages, Im wondering if theres any tool to convert the stored procedures to C codep  pI do NOT want to convert them to CLR Stored Procedures I simply want to migrate the logic in my data layer to the C end of my project and automate the grunt work. Most of the stored procedures maybe 70 are simple SELECT  FROM table WHERE id  id affairs, and they could be done just as well with Entity Framework.p  pI know that its not a straight line between TSQL and C as it is from VB.NET to C and that conversion isnt as straightforward you will need to introduce a data layer in C, for example, and some things like cursors dont have corresponding concepts. I just want to move off of stored procedures without the repetitive manual labor if possible.p  pSince this has been put into question by faulty assumptions I already know TSQL, and given the code of any one of these stored procedures I could tell you what they do. There are very good practical reasons why I do not want the logic to continue residing in stored procedures. p

Negative 27066 pWe are working on a pixelart based game for iPhone using Cocos2D. We have a peculiar requirement  we would like users to be able to change the color scheme for some objects. So, for example, we might have a red car with blue wheels the user can use a selector to change among different color schemes, like yellow body and green wheels black body and white wheels and so on.p  pThe simple approach, of course, would be to prerender the art but this will increase the build of the game enormously, since we have 40 color combinations and dozens of objects. p  pWhat is the best way to approach this in your opinion We are complete newbies to Cocos2D, having worked only on nongaming apps, so even pointing us to the right direction in the Cocos2D docs would be more than enoughp  pThanks allp
Negative 27066 pIm new to AS3 and HaXe, but was hoping to find a way to use methods from a final class Graphics without always prefixing an instance variable.p  pInstead of something like thisp  precodevar grGraphics  flash.Lib.current.graphics  gr.clear gr.beginFill0xffffff, 1 gr.drawRect0,0,400,400 codepre  pI was hoping to get something that works like processing.org, but I guess a lot of the convenience there comes from the preprocessing. I looked at the HaXe reference on advanced types a hrefhttphaxe.orgreftypeadvanced relnofollowhttphaxe.orgreftypeadvanceda, but I havent been able to make anything work so far. This probably isnt possible since Graphics is final, but I thought it wouldnt hurt to ask. It seems it would be easy if I could extend Graphics. Anyway, thanks for reading.p

Negative 27066 pWe recently purchased a codesigning certificate and Ive been incorporating the code signing step into our automated builds.p  pOur build script has to build both VB6 and .NET projects, so we currently have a batch file that builds everything. For the .NET projects, our build script calls MSBUILD, passing in a solution file to build. The projects in these solutions have some thirdparty dependencies, and these files all have the strongCopy Localstrong option turned on in emReferencesem, since they are needed to run the application. In addition, some projects use COM Interop, and so they have automaticallygenerated Interop assemblies such as strongInterop.MSXML2.dllstrong that are also copied to the to the output folder during a build.p  pIm trying to figure out an easy to only code sign the files that are compiled during the build i.e. emourem assemblies, and ignore thirdparty libraries and Interop assemblies, without resorting to having to call strongsigntool.exestrong on each assembly separately.p  pCurrently, I worked around this by doing the following in the build scriptp  ul liMake sure the build cleans all previouslybuilt filesli liCompile the .NET solution with MSBUILD, specifying an output folder for the buildli liRecursively sign all of the binaries EXEs, DLLs, OCXs in the output folder with strongsigntool.exestrong. This signs everything, including the thirdparty libraries and autogenerated Interop assembliesli liMy thirdparty dependencies are in a separate codelibcode folder, so I copy all of the files from codelibcode back into the build output folder, overwriting the copies that the build copied there. This way these files are no longer signed, but our assemblies still areli ul  pMy question is, is there a better way to do this The only other alternative I can think of is to call strongsigntool.exestrong individually on each assembly that needs signing, but this could be a pain because of the number of projects and the amount of change occurring in them assemblies get renamed, move, get deleted as the projects evolve. Plus, I dont want to have to guess whether a particular assembly got signed or not, so looping through the files and signing them in bulk makes the most sense to me.p  pAt the same time, however, it doesnt seem right morally, legally, or otherwise to arbitrarily sign files that we didnt create with our codesigning certificate.p  pOr maybe Im going about this the wrong way altogetherp

Negative 27066 pI am trying to find a simple way to use something like Perls hash functions in R essentially caching, as I intended to do both Perlstyle hashing and write my own memoisation of calculations.  However, others have beaten me to the punch and have packages for memoisation.  The more I dig, the more I find, e.g.codememoisecode and codeR.cachecode, but differences arent readily clear.  In addition, its not clear how else one can get Perlstyle hashes or Pythonstyle dictionaries and write ones own memoization, other than to use the codehashcode package, which doesnt seem to underpin the two memoization packages.p  pSince I can find no information on CRAN or elsewhere to distinguish between the options, perhaps this should be a community wiki question on SO What are the options for memoization and caching in R, and what are their differencesp  hr  pAs a basis for comparison, here is a list of the options Ive found.

Negative 27066 pI would like to change the wallpaper of all desktops formerly spaces on a screen. As of OS X 10.6 there is a category to NSWorkspace which allows the setting of the wallpaper, however, when I use this function only the wallpaper of the current desktop gets changed and all the other desktops remain unchanged.p  pI then looked at the desktop preferences plist and wrote a class that modifies it to reflect the changes I want basically set a new image file path. After the new file was saved I sent the com.apple.desktop BackgroundChanged notification  Google if you dont know what I am talking about, this was how people changed wallpapers in pre 10.6 days. At first this didnt produce any result, so instead of nil as userInfo dictionary I sent the exact same userInfo dictionary along as Apple does when you change the wallpaper in your settings subscribe to the notification in an app and change the wallpaper in the settings app and you will see what it looks like. Luck helped me here, when I sent the notification this way for some reason the Dock crashed and when it reloaded, it loaded the settings from the preferences file thus displaying my changes.p  pThis works on 10.7.1, however, I would a rather not have the bad user experience of the dock crashing and reloading, and b use a path that is more or less guaranteed to work in future releases as well. Exploiting a bug doesnt seem like a stable path.p  pAny other ideas on how to change the wallpaper of all desktops I am also unsure whether the current behaviour of the NSWorkspace wallpaper category is intended or a bug, however, judging from the behaviour of the wallpaper preferences pane it seems that the former is the case.p

Negative 27066 pAs the title says Im trying to read from an address I found in Cheat Engines pointer scan. But the only problem is the only pointers Ive ever had to work with are just Pointer Address  Offset. I am using C .Net 4.0 from Visual Studio 2010. I think I remember seeing something about this before but I didnt think to much about it as it didnt apply to me at the time.p  pSomething about getting the Process or Module ID and adding it to the pointer address then adding the offset and reading from there But I cant remember the commands to get a processes ID or Module ID p  pAlso this is a level 5 pointer Im working with, Ive only used level 1 or 2 pointers but Im guessing its around the same. Just read the address from the pointers until I get a base address to write to.p  pIf it helps my pointer looks like this ProcessName.exe003E6D98p  pIt might help if you said why in the world you need to play with pointers from .NET  John Saundersp  pI am making a trainer for one of my games. Ive made them before just not with this type of pointer and I forgot exactly how to handle this type of address. I think I have to get the modules id but Ive forgotten how. Im actually pretty good with memory and pointers I just usually have the average address without the process name next to it.p

Negative 27066 pIve got the following codeTabItemcode template where the codeTabItemcode contains an image whose source depends on the codeIsSelectedcode property.

Negative 27066 pImagine youre going to manage a number of servers with a number of different services thats used by a number of people. Now say you want to reconfigure or replace some software on one of those servers. Obviously you dont want to work on servers that are in production. p  pIf this was a code change, as a developer, I would make the change on my local development machine, test it locally and commit the change to a version control system. The changes could then be deployed in a staging environment, tested further and finally deployed in a production environment. It would also be easy for me to roll back, if necessary.p  pGenerally, or specifically, how do you achieve this in system administrationp  pThe first thing that comes to mind is to use virtual machines and put virtual machine images in version control, but Im sure there is a lot of literature and clever solutions Im not presently aware of.p

Negative 27066 pIve got a template that has a lot of includes nested in for loops.  Weve got different parts of pages broken out into separate template files because we reuse them by piecing them together in different ways for different views.p  pFor example      for user in users           include userDetail.html       endfor p  pWe have some 40k records in our database.  Ive pinpointed the issue to the templating system.  rendertoresponse takes about 11 seconds to run.  I figured maybe Django wasnt caching the templates, so maybe it was an IO issue.p  pI flatted one of our templates so theres no includes at all, and shaved off about 5 seconds.  But this isnt very helpful in our situation where we reuse a lot of the template code.p  pDoes anybody know a solution to this problem  Or does anybody have any other ideas why rendertoresponse would be taking so longp  pstrong[edit]strong I should mention that I enabled Djangos caching template loader, and it only saved about 1 second.  Flattening the template was significantly quicker.p
Negative 27066 pIm making a traditional rhythm game in XNA, and I have a simple formula that calculates the distance from the guide notes that a note has to be from the guide note relative to the time in which the note is designated to hit the guide note as well as speed of the note. The problem is that the notes pass the guide notes 12 seconds earlier than designated. The note moves at 1 pixel a frame, and I noticed that when the window is active, the note moves a little faster than expected and passes the guide note early. When the window is inactive I gave the focus to my task bar so that I was still able to see the game, the note arrives at the guide note exactly at the designated time. If you find that I am unclear, I will try to provide as much detail as possible Thank you I forgot to mention that FPS is also relative in the formula.p

Negative 27066 pThere is something that I really dont understand with the HttpListener.p  pThe code below speaks for itself and expose the issue in one way.p  pI simply instantiate two different HttpListener with the same single prefix for each one.

Negative 27066 pXCode 3.6.2, OS X 10.6.8p  pTo build a command line tool BSD API that incorporates objectiveC code, I created a new XCode project and selected Cocoa Application. I then added a second target with the template Cocoa, Shell Tool which, according to the description, is for building a command line tool that uses Cocoa APIs. I made the second target dependent on the first. p  pThe first target built correctly and produced an app that worked correctly. However, the second target, though building and debugging correctly failed to produce an executable in either Debug or Release. I also searched elsewhere, but with no success.p  pTo troubleshoot, I reduced my main.m to a simple Hello world print statement p  precodeint mainint argc, char argv[]      printfHello world n     return 0  codepre  pwith print output directed to the Console. Once again the app was created and worked correctly when doubleclicked, and once again the second target built and debugged correctly but did not create anything. I should also add that the icon under Executables was present but remained a writing pad and pencil rather than the dark rectangle associated with a binary file. I have tried a command line build with xcodebuild and got exactly the same result. I had suspected a linking problem, but surely not with such a simple main statementp  pAs I have not tried this particular combination in XCode before it is likely that I am missing something obvious. However, I would be very grateful if someone could enlighten me and yes, I have searched long and hard.p  pDavid.p
Negative 27066 pI am using semantic.gs to create a grid for a webpage.

Trust me, they are an exact copy and paste of the official demo as you can see in the fiddle.p  pThe grid import is the official download of the grid mixins. I didnt change it. The big mystery here is why with the same markup and SCSS I get different resultsp  pCould it be due to my compilation process Im using the Scout app to monitor my SCSS folder.

It seems like the same results can be achieved either way  its a question of time to develop or available funds GreenHat etc. arent cheap.p  pThanks in advancep  pEDITp  pHaving checked one of the links1 posted below, I think this is what Im getting atp  pVirtual services are just test stubs that you can make yourself.p  pWhile you can code your own stubs, once you get past very simplistic behaviors the effort and cost of mocking up all the systems you depend on throughout the software development lifecycle becomes overwhelming. Service Virtualization demands automation in that the simulation and modeling can be conducted by direct observation on the part of software rather than requiring manual coding and adjustment. Otherwise, you may be spending as much time maintaining your stub environments as you do building and testing the application functionality itself.p  pSame as any tool then basically, ehp  p1 a hrefhttpservicevirtualization.comtop10 relnofollowhttpservicevirtualization.comtop10ap

Negative 27066 pI am having trouble grasping what the best implementation of this functionality. My end goal is to take stats from a note document such as word count and line count by session session being one instance of opening the document and editing it then closing it. Then take that data and graph it over time. I cant find anything related to using core data this way. Im using a NSFetchedResultsController in line with the awesome iOS lectures posted by Stanford.p  pThis could simply be a huge misinterpretation of core data on my part. Would it be easier to save each session data as NSString attributes in a similar format to timestamp  wordCount and timestamp  lineCount for later parsingp  pI have an app which has a text documnt lets call them notes entities. Each note entity has a stats entity associated with it in a onetoone relationship. The notes entities keep individual total wordCount and lineCount attributes while the stats entity keeps data attributes in data sets in the NSString format mentioned above.p  pThe reasoning is that I want to be able to launch the notes objects on start without having to load a ton of data on app launch. p  pIs this the best way to keep this sort of data Just seems kind of jenky to me for a lack of better words. I read the apple documentation on Core Data, watched some tutorials including the Stanford lectures and searched this up through Googlefu skills but couldnt find anything. This is my first time using Core Data so I believe Im just having a hard time actually applying what Ive learned.p  pIf I missed anything please feel free to call me out as I was writing this while walking.

Negative 27066 blockquote   pstrongPossible Duplicatestrongbr   a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions92859whatarethedifferencesbetweenstructandclassincWhat are the differences between struct and class in Ca  p blockquote    pIm just trying to figure out if using C structs in C are essentially useless or not.  Do you gain anything by using them opposed to simply creating another classp  pIn C the point of structs is obvious, simply contiguous allocations of grouped data and a nice way to access said data, in C I feel the role becomes a little more vague.p  pSeeing as that you can have functions which are members of structs, instance variables, and visibility labels, the only real difference that I see between structs and classes in C is that struct members default to public while class members default to private.  The way I see them, they can actually both be implemented with the same exact underlying system.p  pSo am I missing something here as to the purpose of structs in C  Or have they kind of lost their purpose, as I feel they have in Cp

My application will use diffrent prices for same product with same options one piece normal price, another 70 price for example.p

Negative 27066 pWhy does codeimagepathcode insist on appending codeassetscode to the front of image paths that are stored in publicimagesp  pIm building a photographers website, so naturally we want photos to be in it, including a random subselection of some photos to be shown as part of the layout. Further, Ive built a supersimple gallery that just displays all photos. Those image files are stored inp  precodepublicimagesgallery codepre  pIve gotten an ImageMagick gem to shrink them to the desired size. Those small files are stored inp  precodepublicimagesgallerysm codepre  pThe shrinking is done on page load as part of rendering the layout ERB. I know it might initially sound awful, but it only shrinks an image once, and the lazyshrinking means we dont have to restart the server to add new photos which hed want to do.p  pMy reading suggests that the asset pipeline is for static layout stuff, but this is more dynamic than that. Im led to believe that publicimages is where this stuff should go, especially since productionmode Rails complains that the generated thumbnails are not compiled. p  pEnter the problem I place those images in the paths shown above, and imagepath gives back what looks like an asset pipeline path. It doesnt even work when I flatten the subdirectories and have everything live in publicimages.p  pMy workaround is to build the tag manually. So is imagepath and by extension, imagetag only for asset pipeline stuff Am I supposed to construct  tags from strings for public images Ive also found mentions that imagepath is supposed to look in public for a matching file first, but Ive also seen documentation a hrefhttpapi.rubyonrails.orgclassesActionViewHelpersAssetTagHelper.html relnofollowhttpapi.rubyonrails.orgclassesActionViewHelpersAssetTagHelper.htmla claiming that it wont verify the existence of something it returns a path for.p

Negative 27066 pWhen I call codefzrunpagecode MuPDF only draws the actual PDF objects onto the pixmapp  pstronge.g. text, images, vector graphics, etc.strong. p  pIt does not draw the page bounding box and fill it with a static color e.g. white. Is there a way to have MuPDF draw the page background as well p  pI know that I could use codefzclearpixmapwithvaluecode to manually set the background to a static color before I call codefzrunpage.code But this solution gets problematic as soon as rotation comes into play because then there will be empty unused spaces at the borders of the rotated PDF page. So it would be very helpful if there was a possibility to have MuPDF draw the pages bounding box first, fill its background to a static color, and then draw the PDF objects like text etc. on it.p  pIs this possible somehowp  pThanksp

Negative 27066 pIve been using codeplotcode for quite awhile now and Im wondering how much would be broken if the type argument could override categorical predictors.  Right now plot always attempts boxplots when the x variable is a factor.  It seems that the codeplot.factorcode method always gets called then.  It would be nice if type could override that feature and I didnt have to make the xaxis numerical, suppress it, and then add it later.  Im not interested in a wrapper function since Ive pretty much just described how to do that.  Im just wondering if theres a codeplotcode argument Ive missed that can solve this.p  pFor example, typically a boxplot is attempted in this case...p  precodey lt 14 x lt factorletters[14] ploty  x codepre  pId prefer it to just plot the points and label the xaxes correctly.  The following works but I was hoping for a simpler version.p  precodenx lt lengthx ploty  1nx, xaxt  n axis1, 1nx, x, xlab   codepre  pI was hoping something like the following might work...p  precodeploty  x, type  n points1nx, y codepre  pbut no go.  And codetype  pcode doesnt do it either.p  pI believe this last failure is yet another example of inconsistency in R.  Setting codetype  ncode should be working in method calls as well or it should be mandatory that all codeplotcode functions use it inherited or at least passed through code...code.  Its in codeplot.defaultcode.p

Negative 27066 pIm having difficulty with coding my realloc function.p  pI have it working through standard memcpy procedure, but I cant get it optimized. I know there are two other cases I need to accommodate for expanding the current block forward, and checking if the current sized block is large enough and if too large, split it to free memory.p  pHowever, I cant seem to get it right. I always get errors. To clarify, these are not compile errors... these are heap integrity checks that fail through a trace driver.

The commented section in the middle is my attempt to expand, but I think I need to split because its causing a ton of fragmentation. This is leading to me running out of memory and erroring out during one of the realloc tests.

Negative 27066 pThis is more a question if I am taking a wrong path to accomplish the task.p  pI need to print Data to Receipt Printers from Web Application. p  pBased on what I understand from various posts on net, it seems best option would be to create something like a Print Server not sure about the name.

Negative 27066 pI am trying to use the BreezeKnockout Template written by Ward Bell AKA, BreezeJS MVC Template.  I successfully installed the breezetemplate.VSIX extension by running the downloaded file into VS 2012.  p  pHowever, when I inspect the Extensions and Updates from Tools in VS 2012 the Breeze Knockout Spa Template shows up under Tools not under Templates in the dialog.  I am assuming that is why when I create an ASP.NET MVC 4 Web Application, the Breeze Single Page Application does not appear in the next step when you are prompted to select a template to use.  It simply does not appear in the list of available templates to use.p  pI wanted to install this as a sample template to see a fleshed out usage of Breeze using EF and a datarepository on the back end.  I am using Hot Towel SPA as a starting point, but it really doesnt have any Breeze code.  p  pI added in a simple Breeze DataContext to the Hot Towel Spa template based on the Breeze.WebApi NuGet packages written by Jay Traband.  Using that I was able to modify my project to use EF backed by a SQL database instead of a pseudodatabase as used in the Breeze.WebApi example.  p  pHowever, it looks like the BreezeKnockout template written by Ward Bell is a more sophisticated example.  I need this more sophisticated sample to server as an example for how I want to use Breeze.p  pSo after a long explanation here is what I am askingp  p1 How can I get the BreezeKnockout template to install as a template instead of as a tool in the VS 2012 Extensions and Updatesp  p2 If there isnt an answer to 1, is there somewhere where I download a VS 2012 project based on the BreezeKnockout templatep  p3 If the answer to 2 is no, will Ward Bell please make a simple project based on this template available via GitHub, or other public code repository NuGet Please.p  p4 Is there some other nontrivial example of Breeze using EF and a data repository that is available to use as a referencep

Negative 27066 pI have some functions which take very specific matrices with specific information loaded in using another function Ive made. Currently the matrices the function accepts are the normal R matrix type. However Id like to assign them as a different type or class so as to achieve easy input checking so the user cant throw any matrix into the function.p  pI figured the S3 method would be easy after seeing a few examples on the netp  precodemat1 lt matrixc110,ncol5  colnamesmat1 lt cONE,TWO,THREE,FOUR,FIVE  as.sdpmgdna lt functionx    classx lt sdpmgdna   returnx   mat2 lt as.sdpmgdnamat1 codepre  pThis appears to work in so far as if I return mat2 I see a matrix, and if I call it via indecies mat2[1,2] I get the right values I should get. However I cant be sure some things have changed  it is now described as sdpmgdna[10] i.e. it seems to ignore it has 2 dimensions, although doing the above and printing mat2 to screen shows it clearly does have 2 dimensions. Another odd thing is if I do codecolnamesmat2code they are returned. However if I try to find the colname of an individual column e.g. codecolnamemat2[,4]code then the value returned is codeNULLcode. Can anyone explain why this is or what I should do  I really want it to basically be a matrix, but because the functions require it to be very specific in terms of a matrix of what and how big, defining it as another class would make error and input checking so much easier  and allow me to use the methods mechanism of R so all my custom plotting functions could just be methods of plot.p

Negative 27066 pIm replacing the background view of a codeUITableViewCellcode with my own custom subclass of codeUIViewcode, in which I override the codedrawRectcode method with my own, which creates a multicolored and changing background.p  pThe problem is that when the codeTableViewCellcode is selected, the graphics under are completely hidden and it looks odd. I need to create a custom codeselectedBackgroundViewcode in order to fix this. The problem is that that view needs to create a blue gradient tint over the graphics already there, and I dont know how to draw a codeCGRectcode or something similar that is partially transparent.p

Negative 27066 pIn order to implement chat functionality in my app, I have integrated XMPP framework in to it.

Due to this functionality I have not created any Roster or Privacy list in the app, and anonymous chat mode has been implemented. p  pEverything works fine except block user functionality, since this is an anonymous user chat hence there is no privacy list for the users, and XMPP extension XEP016 only supports blocking through privacy list.p  pI have also tried to look for the alternatives and one of them is to implement XEP0191 but unfortunately Open Fire does not supports this extension. p  pSo techies please guide me to fix this problem.

Negative 27066 pWe are building a mobile app based on webtech. Our endpoint weblogic 11g sends a jessionid cookie as well as a wlauthcookiejessionid cookie which is later automatically sent to the server again for authorization purposes. But we dont want this to happen, rather we want to ask the user to enter his credentials at the start of the app, then store these credentials within javascript runtime variables and, if the user clicks logout, we toss those variables. But then if one enters arbitrary login credentials, the ajax request attaches the cookies to the request and the server ignores our BASIC header and instead uses the former cookies to authorize the user. p  pSo how do we either delete the cookies, or block them from being placed in the first placep

Negative 27066 pJust need some clarification.p  pIf I have a form with fields that should not be modified by the user then I need to use the HiddenFor helper to pass those values through otherwise those values will be missing and Model Binding will ensure Nulls are stored for those Field Values.p  pOf course this seems over zealous of the Model Binder, and one would think that if a field did not exist at all in the Viewresponse stream then that field would be left untouched. Obviously an EditFor field with a value of  is different and that value should be null or .p  pThe only other approach I have come across is to use objects mappers such as Automapper to ensure nulls are ignored.p  pAt the moment I will just use hidden fields to pass the values through. p  pThoughts on the above appreciated or rather what is the recommended method for dealing with this issuep  pThanks.p

Negative 27066 pHeres the use case I am trying to solve for A user submits a form to a long running serverprocess.

But I have to be able to support the user breaking the client connection and coming back later.p

Negative 27066 pSorry if this is a repeat question, I tried searching but I couldnt find anything that relates to my problem. p  pI have a byte value in which each bit or group of bits means something. I have an enum with a custom attribute to define those bits, as so p  precode[Flags] public enum Config4      [StringValueEnable goodread beep]     GoodReadBeep  1 ltlt 0,     [StringValueLow beeper volume]     LowBeep  1 ltlt 1,     [StringValueMedium beeper volume]     MediumBeep  1 ltlt 2,     [StringValueLow beeper frequency]     LowFrequency  1 ltlt 3,     [StringValueMedium beeper frequency]     MediumFrequency  1 ltlt 4,     [StringValueMedium beeper duration]     MediumDuration  1 ltlt 5,     [StringValueLong beeper duration]     LongDuration  1 ltlt 6,     [StringValueReserved]     Reserved  1 ltlt 7  codepre  pThe catch is that apart from these individual definitions, pairs or even groups of bits are defined something else. For example, codeLowBeep  MediumBeep  HighBeepcode. p  pLets say I have a byte value 47 that I want to find the string representation to. The method i have implemented currently involves finding the number of bits set in the byte, then iterating through those bits and appending the string value from the enum. Something like the following     p  precodefor int i  0 i lt bitsSet.Count i      answer  ConfigDataHolder.Config4bitsSet[i].GetStringValue  ,   codepre  pThis poses a problem when groups of bits are defined. In the case mentioned above, 47 would contain both codeMediumBeepcode and codeLowBeepcode and thus the string representation shoud be codeHighBeepcode instead of codeMediumBeepcode and codeLowBeepcode individually. p  pIs there a more effecient way to fetch the string representation of each bit set in the byte considering there could be groups of bits that mean something completely different than if the individual bits were set p  pThanks Riship

Negative 27066 pessentially I am wondering if it is possible to write a function so that if any item inside a specific container is clicked and nothing happens, it will codealertcode that the feature has not been made available yet.p  h1explanationh1  pwhat I mean by nothing happens is that the DOM or site does not change. So if a javascript or jquery function is called on click, it would not alert. if the item is a link to another site, it would not alert. but if nothing happens on the click event of an item inside a specified container, then it would alert.p

Negative 27066 pA week ago I have submitted an application which supports Blackberry Z10. Yesterday, I finished another version which supports Blackberry Q10 and Blackberry Q5. At the moment, my app on the market is version 3.0 and it only supports Z10. p  pIf I upload a new bundle, the version of the app automatically increase to 4.0. This bundle also only supports Q10 and Q5 as the previous version already supported Z10. In this case, what will happen to Z10 users Will they receive the update version 4.0, as it is a newer version, although I already set the specific devices to Q10 and Q5p  pIn the future, if I make some update, how can I manage itp  pCheers, p

Negative 27066 pMSDN says, for the codeThread.Abortcode methodp  blockquote   pWhen this method is invoked on a thread, the system throws a ThreadAbortException in the thread to abort it. ThreadAbortException is a special exception that can be caught by application code, but is rethrown at the end of the catch block unless ResetAbort is called. ResetAbort cancels the request to abort, and prevents the ThreadAbortException from terminating the thread. Unexecuted finally blocks are executed before the thread is aborted.p blockquote  pSo the exception would be thrown only once from the most immediate codecatchcode block, or from all encapsulating codecatchcode blocks  Also, when saying unexecuted codefinallycode blocks are executed, does it include both totally unexecuted and partially executed blocksp

If I assign above 16 bytes not power of 2 then it allocates 32 bytes I guess upto 32 bytes.p  pWhereas in Visual Studio, If I allocate 1 byte then 9 bytes gets allocated, if from 24 bytes then 12 bytes gets allocated, if from 58 bytes then 16 bytes gets allocated by the compiler.p  pAnyone know why this kind of assignment p  pAtleast In Visual studio, if there is buffer overflow I get a debug error but in gcc nothing happens. GCC only provides segmentation fault only if too large overflow happens.p

Negative 27066 pIm trying to model a unidirectional OneToMany relationship using Hibernate3 with annotations. The scenario is that a user emhasem many articles and an article emhasem many users.

Negative 27066 pFirstly, Im REALLY new to programming. Ive just started my first programming class two weeks ago, and I apologize if I sound newbish.p  pMy professor wants me to implement a press any key to continue... thing in my program.

This is what my code looks likep  precode    include ltstdio.hgt     int main                printfThis is the first line of this program          systempause          printfThis is the second line      codepre  pExcept he wants us to do this in Linux, so systempause wont work in this case. Is there a way to have it do exactly what pause does, but in linux termsp  pagain, sorry if i sound newbish. thank you so muchp  pAlso, he doesnt really care if the code is efficient or anything, as long as it runs.

This will create an empty UIView and assign it to the inputview property of the UITextView.li liTap the button Set inputview to nil. This will assign nil to the inputview property of UITextView. This is done in order to show the system keyboard.li liTap the button Dismiss ViewController. This will dismiss the view controller to return to the original view controller.li ol  pAs soon as the ViewController is dismissed, the app crashes immediately. The crash log sometimes, but not always, refers to an unrecognized selector being sent to an object. The objects type is different every time the crash is reproduced.p  pHas anyone else come across this sort of bugp

Negative 27066 pI have several GUIs which open progressively that are all experiencing the same issue.  When I open them, the first object which is selected is a codeTextCtrlcode object.  These GUIs are rather large and have scroll bars.  Since a codeTextCtrlcode object is selected, scrolling with the mouse wheel does nothing and makes it appear as if the scroll bars are broken.  To demonstrate this, I made the following codep  precodeimport wx  class Testerwx.Frame     def initself         wx.Frame.initself, None, 1, Window, size500, 500         self.panel  wx.ScrolledWindowself,wx.IDANY          self.panel.SetScrollbars30,30,600,400          textBox  wx.TextCtrlpanel, 1, , size200, 150, stylewx.TEMULTILINEwx.TELEFT         textStuff  wx.StaticTextpanel, 1, AnbunchnofnlinesntonmakenthisnlongnenoughntonhavenscrollnbarsnnnnnnnnnnIts lonely down herennnn         lonelyBtn  wx.Buttonpanel, 1, So Lonely           vbox  wx.BoxSizerwx.VERTICAL         vbox.AddtextBox, flagwx.EXPANDwx.LEFTwx.RIGHTwx.TOP, border10         vbox.AddtextStuff, flagwx.LEFTwx.RIGHTwx.TOP, border10         vbox.AddlonelyBtn, flagwx.LEFTwx.RIGHTwx.TOP, border10          panel.SetSizervbox         panel.Layout  app  wx.PySimpleApp Tester.Show app.MainLoop codepre  pWhen you run this and try to scroll down, youll notice you cannot scroll with the mouse wheel.p  pSo far, this all makes sense. Heres where it gets a little weird.  If the selected object is a codeButtoncode, using the mouse wheel engages the scroll bars. You can test this by pressing the button, then using the mouse wheel.  Also, strongclicking on the panel, or even the scroll bar itself, doesnt allow the mouse wheel to work.strongp  pstrongWhat Im looking forstrong is a way to make sure that if there are scroll bars, they can be used with the mouse wheel upon displaying the GUI they are selected by default. I can accept that the mouse wheel will not function once a user clicks into the text control.p  pAdditionally, if you have an explanation for why the mouse wheel works for buttons and not text controls, Id love to hear itp  pstrongEDITstrong I know I can add a listener thanks to Mr. Joran Beasley, but this means that the scroll bars within a multiline text control can never be used with the mouse wheel.  The ideal solution which Im not sure is possible, is to have clicking on anywhere outside the text control panel or scroll bar allows the mouse wheel to scroll the panel.  Is this possiblep  pAdditionally, Ive switched over to using codeScrolledWindowcode instead of codeScrolledPanelcodep  pstrongEDIT 2strong The fix was to use the followingp  precodeself.panel.Bindwx.EVTMOTION, self.onMouseMove  def onMouseMoveself, event         self.panel.SetFocusIgnoringChildren codepre  hr  pstrongEDIT 3strong The emactualem fix was to do something a little tricky.  Using the code below I bound only multiline text controls to codeEVTENTERWINDOWcode and codeEVTLEAVEWINDOWcode as well as binding every item and the panel itself to codeEVTMOUSEWHEELcode.

Negative 27066 h2Problemh2  pIm working on an Xcode project thats meant to be built into a library and included in other projects, either as a CocoaPod or in a workspace. Im using agvtool to set the bundle and marketing versions.  I wanted to add a simple method for reading the version of the library as part of the API, and its turned into a much more complicated thing than I anticipated. I had initially implemented my versionString method like thisp  precode NSString versionString    return [NSString stringWithFormat., [[[NSBundle mainBundle] infoDictionary] objectForKeyCFBundleShortVersionString], [[[NSBundle mainBundle] infoDictionary] objectForKeyCFBundleVersion]]  codepre  pHowever, when the library is included in a workspace, codeCFBundleShortVersionStringcode and codeCFBundleVersioncode get their values from the workspace, strongnotstrong from the library So, if the library is marketing version 1.2 and the bundle version is 3, but it is included in a workspace that is marketing version 2.0 and bundle version 130, this method would return code2.0.130code instead of code1.2.3code.p  pDoes anyone know of a way that I can get access to the librarys codeCFBundleShortVersionStringcode instead of the workspacesp  h2Additional Infoh2  pI started digging into some of the more obscure aspects of codeagvtoolcode, and Ive discovered a reliable way to get access to the bundle version, but what I would really prefer is the marketing version, as thats what I would use to indicate API compatibility. p  pcodeagvtoolcode will set the codeCurrent Project Versioncode property in your build settings, so if you set codeVersioning Systemcode to codeApple Genericcode, Xcode will generate a .c file with some global constants for you as part of the build process. All you have to do to gain access to those values is expose them in your own header, like thisp  precodeextern const unsigned char PRODUCT NAMEVersionString[] extern const double PRODUCT NAMEVersionNumber codepre  pWhen I saw this, I thought for sure I was on the right track. VersionNumber is indeed 3.0, but VersionString is codePROGRAMPRODUCT NAME  PROJECTPRODUCT NAME3code.p  pIt seems like I might be able to get what I want by setting the codeGenerated Versioning Variablescode parameter in the build settings, but Im also getting the suspicion that I started in the wrong direction and Im only getting further off track.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 27066 pBackground we are porting an enterprise system to have android clients.  The architecture for windows and html is based around a core library that does the hard business logic but no user interaction at all, and we use programs or single page web apps to provide the user interface and simply call the core API library to actually do stuff.p  pThe core is implemented as a shared library on windows and built into each app. If we mirror this and use a java library, we need to share files using external storage, which is a not permitted as data needs to be reasonably secure. Nb data is binary data, not Sql database, in case that is relevantp  pSo we thought about using a bound service, and using intents, content provider etc, but it seems from googling we must then distribute the background service separately the user interface app, but this seems terrible experience for new users. However, a bound service seems ideal from all other angles.p  pWe also cannot guarantee which apps a user might download, we will have at least 10 individual apps all doing logically different things, but referencing similar data.p  pIn briefp  ul lilots of individual apps all wanting access to same datali lino control over which apps are downloadedli liusing external data is not permitted as data should be semi secureli liusing sqllite might not work as data is long binary chunks  eg 3Mb plus .

Negative 27066 pI would like to unit test a class that acts as a codeCBPeripheralManagerDelegatecode  to the codeCBPeripheralManagercode class.  Typically, in order to stub out an external class dependency, I would use either a form of dependency injection by passing in via the class initializer or via  a property. When dealing with singletonbased APIs, I have been able to use libraries like Kiwi to stub the class level method that returns the singleton i.e. code[ClassName stubselectorsharedInstance andReturnmyStubbedInstance]code.  The issue in the case of mocking codeCBPeripheralManagercode is that its initializer takes the delegate instance.  So any code that uses my class would need to do something like thisp  precodePeripheralManagerWrapper wrapper  [[PeripheralManagerWrapper alloc] init] CBPeripheralManager peripheralManager  [[CBPeripheralManager alloc] initWithDelegatewrapper queuenil optionsnil] wrapper.peripheralManager  peripheralManager codepre  pThen, for unit testing my codePeripheralManagerWrappercode class, I could simply instantiate it and pass in a mocked codeCBPeripheralManagercode.  However, I dont like requiring any calling code of my wrapper object to have to go through this setup.  Is there a better pattern for dealing with this situation  Ive used both Kiwi and OCMockito, but neither seem to provide this functionality short of maybe stubbing the codealloccode and codeinitcode methods of codeCBPeripheralManagercode and then just instantiating the instance in the codePeripheralManagerWrappercode s initializer.p

Negative 27066 pIs there any convention for functions written in jQuery that are to be called from a child document i.e. inside an codeltiframegtcode to the parent documentp  pFollowing on from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq21413455930393my question yesterdaya, regarding the use of an codeiFramecode in a jQuery UI code.dialogcode... I need the page inside the codeiframecode to alter the size of the dialog at a particular time.p  pI already have this working, with the following code in the child document...p  precodewindow.parent.myDiv.dialogoption, height, 180.dialogoption, width, 300 codepre  pHowever, I think it would be cleaner and easier to understand if the code which is much more complex than just that line was included with the original code.dialogcode code in the parent document.p  pThis could obviously be done simply having the following in the parent document...p  precodefunction resizeDialog    myDiv.dialogoption, height, 180.dialogoption, width, 300  codepre  p... and the following in the child documentp  precodewindow.parent.resizeDialog codepre  pHowever, I want to know if there is any convention for including the resizeDialog function as part of the codemyDivcode so that it be called with something like...p  precodewindow.parent.myDiv.resize codepre  hr  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI guess the question Im trying to ask is thisp  pIs it considered unacceptable to have a function like this when using jQuery...p  precodefunction resizeDialog    myDiv.dialogoption, height, 180.dialogoption, width, 300  codepre  pIf so, then what is the format for having a jQuery function that can be called from outside of the current documentp

I can retrieve the desired workflow entity, but the required components are not referenced in that object to my knowledge.p  pUsing that same id with a codeRetrieveRequiredComponentsRequestcode does run, but it returns an codeEntityCollectioncode with 0 records as a result.

Negative 27066 pI need a container which has ability to search over 1 million items pretty fast and keep the insertion order. p  pSo first I thought about stdmap but it doesnt care about the insertion order it orders the data according to the key.

So I did something like thatp  precodestruct myData      unsigned long id     unsigned long insertionOrder      myData      myData unsigned long id,unsigned long insertionOrderidid, insertionOrderinsertionOrder       myData     typedef multiindexcontainerlt     myData,          indexedbylt                 randomaccessltgt,   keep insertion order             orderednonuniquelt memberlt myData, unsigned long, amp myDataidgt gt         gt  gt myDataContainerType codepre  pI can push data into the container without any problem.

Negative 27066 pFirst off, hello Im new to this website so I apologize for any errors that I make postingwise.p  pI am in a web technology class where we are learning JavaScript. In a previous class we learned HTML5 and CSS. Our current assignment is to make a webpage that will either display 1 of 3 images or no images when the user enters the corresponding word in the prompt window.p  pI was wondering if there was a way to account for userentered typos For example, I have in the code Spn but was wondering if there was a way to easily make it so that if a user were to enter Son by mistake, they would still be shown the image. Is there a way to do this without having to add a separate if statementp  pBelow is the code I have so far, which includes my little test to see if I could do this. I thought it had worked when I only had two items ex Spn, spn, but when I added a third it stopped working, and now it isnt working again. I may have very well been mistaken that there was ever a success, though.p  pOh, also, we are only allowed to use JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. So if you have a solution that is jquery I have no idea what that is, then thankyou, but Im afraid I cant use it.p  pPlease let me know if there is any other information that you need and I will gladly supply it to you.

Being more specific, I am running a single Timer with TimerTask, which keeps loading data from that PLC every period. But here comes the main problem  a single variable readed from data block takes about 250ms. I want to read more variables at the same time. So basically, it takes variables250ms in time. I think that threading here would be absolutely necessary to achieve dreamed goals. p  pCome little more deeper into the codep  pFrom the beginning. I am starting a Timer as thisp  precodeTimer timer  new Timer timer.scheduledc, 0, period codepre  pWhere the dc is instance of a DataCollector class, which gets the data from PLC. A vital fragment of method run in DataCollector is like thisp  precodeOverride public void run      variables  readFromPlc codepre  pAnd here comes the problem I am standing at. readFromPlc calls read from another class called TCP. In that class, I am creating as many threads as are variables. But the problem is how to keep those threads running in period of time. I create those Threads in constructor and at the first time, they of course call run and properly read datas from plc and show them to a graph. But thats end of those threads  run wont be called again. p  pIf i could stop and continue threads repeatedly, that would be great. But I am structed here.  PS I cant simple make a new instance of TCP, because I have some other methods and functional code there which I dont want to run again.p  pOR very simplyfied I want to run threads run method every period of time f.e. every second.p  pI would appreciate any help.p  pThanks, Michael p

I have confirmed the lexor is converting the objects correctly. However, when I go to print the types the lexor has found I run into an error. p  pThere appears to be an issue with records in a nested table, the second recordand any following records in the tables shows up in the list but when i try to print the entire table, the second records objects appear to be null. p  pI suspect the issue is casting or memory management in oracle 10G vs oracle 9i because to print an object it has to be cast from its type to a JSON value. I havent seen any changes in the oracle versions that would cause the second objects objects in nested tables to be null. p  pCan anyone explain the difference in 9i and 10G that could cause my nested table to have null records for the second rowand beyond when casted  p  pAll of my code works has been tested in 11G the docs for the program indicate 10G should be supported though..The only changes I have made to the core libraries is in adding a regex like sudo function in the lexor in order to support parsing..p  pEDIT So the function was actually a reference to a type..for some reason the developer named it cast, and it was reference a variable of sys.anydata type..p  pEDIT I have narrowed the error down to the loading an object using getobject from sys.anydata .  Yet I dont see any changes that happen to that with Oracle 10G..Im not sure whats wrong with the get object..it works on the first object but not the second object... p  pEdit I havent done testing to confirm this so its just conjecture, if anyone can provide docs for it I would accept there answer ..but I suspect the issue Im having is because sys.anydata.convertobject does not implicitly convert collections in 9i.. I think this behavior changed in 10g.. Meaning I need to call create anydata and fill it with convertobject and convertcollection anywhere that I have objects with collections.. p

Negative 27066 pI have a C Class Library project that is referenced by many different Line of Business solutions, lets call it MyCompanyUtilities. MyCompanyUtilities contains database access code, code for retrieving data from our ERP system about our employees, useful extension methods, code to send emails etc.p  pOccasionally, I want to refactor the code in MyCompanyUtilities, which would sometimes introduce breaking changes in other projects.

Negative 27066 pI have a large XML data feed 5GB dropped to me daily I need to get it via HTTP.

Negative 27066 pI am working on a simple AlarmManager example, and have run into an interesting problem. I am setting a boolean value to be passed through our intent based on a button that is clicked. There is a repeat alarm and one time alarm button that tells us whether or not we are supposed to repeat our Alarm or have a one time Alarm, I am utilizing the ability to pass extra values with intents intent.putExtrakey,value, nothing new, nothing special.

Negative 27066 pIm trying to conceptualize how to communicate and sync the data between my view tablets and the server.p  pFist let me describe the set up I have several tablets running the same app that can choose to display any view in particular. A main server contains the models for all those views and manipulates the data in those models. The tablets will only be used to display said data and send back touch inputs.p  pIf I understand sockets well enough, you can send entire serialized objects through a network from a java server to an android device.p  pAs a result, this made me come up with the following way to handle the situation I will have the same model object per view on the server, and have the same model object on the tablet. Both the server and the tablets will contain their own controllers for those models views.  Every second or so, the tablets will send back the state of their model object to the server, which will change the states of all the model objects if necessary, and send those objects back out to be displayed.p  pA big issue that I see with this, is what will happen when a model is changed by two different sources, Id have to figure out some merging methods which seems like a wee bit of hassle, but doable. Also, having it update once per second, I wonder if that will cause a noticeable lag or not.p  pAre there better ideas as far as how to accomplish this type of communication, perhaps a well known patternp
Negative 27066 pI have tried many different ways to try to create a 10 second video file out of an image file and have used all the same switches and codecs as I used to encode my video file.  However, when I concat the two using anything but complexfilter which forces the video through another round of transcoding, the resulting video file is corrupt.  I believe this is due to the inherent differences of the 10 second clip that ffmpeg created from the image, but there must be some way to get it to encode the exact same way as my video file.p  pHere is the command I am using to turn the image into a 10s video clip I added a silent mp3 because I thought that an audio stream starting partway through the video was messing things upp  precodeffmpeg loop 1 i splash.jpg i silence.mp3 cv libx264 preset slow g 60 r 29.97 crf 16 ca libfdkaac ba 256k cutoff 18000 t 5 tmpoutput1.mp4 codepre  pHere is the command I am using to encode my videop  precodeffmpeg i input.f4v cv libx264 preset slow g 60 r 29.97 crf 16 ca libfdkaac ba 256k cutoff 18000 tmpoutput2.mp4 codepre  pHere is the command I use to convert both of them to .ts to get ready for concatp  precodeffmpeg i tmpoutput1.mp4 c copy bsfv h264mp4toannexb f mpegts tmpoutput1.ts codepre  pAnd finally the concat which is where I get crazy video corruption, everything along the way looks finep  precodeffmpeg i concattmpoutput1.tstmpoutput2.ts c copy output.mp4 codepre  pAgain, the issue is that Im already transcoding everything once and I should be able to get it to transcode in a similar enough structure so that it can be concatenated without another transcode tacked onto the end.  p  pHas anyone successfully added a fullframe splash graphic to the front of a video with ffmpeg before  I am using a brand new crosscompile of ffmpeg as I thought that might be the issue, but alas, the issue persists after the update.p  pThanksp

Negative 27066 pIm new to objective C and C and got baffled over this comparison tonight.p  pThe code is located in a fast enumeration loop, the variables being n and w.p  pThe broken code piece wasp  precodeif n  w codepre  pAnd fixing it was p  precodeif [n isEqualToStringw] codepre  pI completely understand why the second works, as I was in fact comparing two strings, and that would be the logical method to use Just took me a while to find it However, I dont understand why the first  comparison doesnt work, can anyone explain this in a little detail for me as I cant find any good references exactly how it works.p  pMany Thanks,p
Negative 27066 pI am VERY new to PhP. Quick question that I am having trouble finding the answer to online, although I am sure most of you will quickly know the answer. I have the following code creating an associative array and then I am trying to display it in a table. I know there are easier ways to display it in a table like a foreach loop, but I would like to learn this method first p  precodeclass CarDealer extends Company   var navbararray  array   function  createnavbararray         mainurl  thisgtcompanyurl    get the main url address of this web page     thisgtnavbararray  array Home Pagegtmainurlwhichpagehome, Salesgtmainurlwhichpagesales,        Support gt mainurlwhichpagesupport, Contacts gt mainurlwhichpagecontact     function getLeftNavBar  data lttable border1 stylebackgroundcoloryellow width35gt data .lttrgtlttdgtthisgtnavbararray[Home Page]lttdgtlttrgt data .lttrgtlttdgtthisgtnavbararray[Sales]lttdgtlttrgt data .lttrgtlttdgtthisgtnavbararray[Support]lttdgtlttrgt data .lttrgtlttdgtthisgtnavbararray[Contacts]lttdgtlttrgt data .lttablegt return data    codepre  pLater in my code I create an object for my class and then try to print the table.

Negative 27066 pI am trying to recreate the way the codeviewscode are laid out in a chat application with messages from me aligned to the right and other messages aligned to the left. As of now, I am using a codeListViewcode with an codeArrayAdaptercode. p  pInitially, each list item was a codetextviewcode, but codeAbsListView.LayoutParamscode does not have  gravity. Therefore, I wrapped up my textviews in a codeLinearLayoutcode and then set the gravity of the textview dynamically by getting it codeLayoutParamscode and casting that to codeLinearLayout.LayoutParamscode. I thought this would work, but alas it didntp  pI searched for the reason behind it and I did come across some posts which say that I need another codeLinearLayoutcode inside my first codeLinearLayoutcode for the gravity values to be honored or use a codeRelativeLayoutcode with codelayoutalignEndcode or codelayoutalignStartcode to achieve the effect. p  pIt would be great if someone can explain as to why the layout with a single codeLinearLayoutcode doesnt honor the gravity valuesp

However I do not think that copying the code from SimpleJpaRepository to my custom repositories is a good idea...I think that something should be possible with the entity manager.

Any suggestions on getting SignerName instead of SignerID in the ADO query resultp  pUpdate2p  pHeres a sample SQL statement that returns different fields depending on either its in Access or in ADOp  precodeSELECT MasterAccount.[SignerKey1]  FROM MasterAccount  codepre  pPer Preets request, heres the ADO code in Excel VBAp  precodestrDatabasePath  rgDatabasePathCell.Value rgDatabasePathCell is a worksheet cell object. strPWD  DATABASEPASSWORD  Set cnn  New ADODB.Connection cnn.Provider  Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0 cnn.ConnectionString  Data Source amp strDatabasePath amp Jet OLEDBDatabase Password amp strPWD amp  cnn.Open  Set cmd  New ADODB.Command cmd.ActiveConnection  cnn cmd.CommandType  adCmdText cmd.CommandText  strSQL Set rst  New ADODB.Recordset  rst.Open cmd.Execute  shMA.Cells2, 1.CopyFromRecordset rst shMA is a worksheet object. codepre  pUpdate 3p  pIt occurred to me that from what Ive said so far, it might seem like I could just change thisp  precodeSELECT MasterAccount.[SignerKey1]  FROM MasterAccount  codepre  pto thisp  precodeSELECT [Signers].[SignerName]  FROM MasterAccount  codepre  pBut there are 13 affected lookup fields, all with exactly the same Row Source property text as shown above, and all return different SignerName items for each row. I dont know why they are all returning different items per row I have not been able to find any difference in the way they are defined. Ive been tasked with getting the same result in Excel as that Access query gets.p  pUpdate 4p  pVBlades  Thanks, I found the form that has a tab with dropdowns for each of the 13 SignerKeyn fields. If I rightclick that form and choose Form Properties, the RecordSource property isp  precodeSELECT MasterAccount., Bank.BankRating FROM Bank INNER JOIN MasterAccount ON Bank.BankID  MasterAccount.Bank codepre  pHowever I dont understand how that would be selecting a different SignerName item for each of the 13 SignerKeyn fields, or what to do with this information to get the same results in ADO as in the Access query. Any suggestionsp  pUpdate 5p  pI may be close to a workaround. If I do this, I get the SignerName field for SignerKey1p  precodeSELECT Signers.SignerName FROM Signers RIGHT JOIN MasterAccount ON Signers.SignerID  MasterAccount.SignerKey1.Value codepre  pAnd if I do this, I get different SignerName items for each field on each rowp  precodeSELECT Signers.SignerName, Signers1.SignerName, Signers2.SignerName FROM Signers AS Signers2 INNER JOIN Signers AS Signers1 INNER JOIN Signers RIGHT JOIN MasterAccount ON Signers.SignerID  MasterAccount.SignerKey1.Value ON Signers1.SignerID  MasterAccount.SignerKey2.Value ON Signers2.SignerID  MasterAccount.SignerKey3 codepre  pThat works both in an Access query and in ADO. Next step, Ill try to add these joins to the main SQL statement.p  pUpdate 6p  pWell, when I try to add even one of those 13 joins to the main SQL statement, it works fine in an Access query, but in ADO I get the errorp  pRow handles must all be released before new ones can be obtained.p  pSo Im stuck. Any suggestionsp  pIve raised the issue with the database owner, but they dont know why the affected fields Row Source property includes SignerID, so Im not sure if thats going to help.p

Negative 27066 pIm trying to use AppleScript to click on context menu items in Logic Pro, preferably by simply providing the name of the menu item.

Negative 27066 pIm writing a program that is supposed to create a triangle and throw an exception if the triangle is not legal, meaning that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side.

Negative 27066 pI am working with a PHP class which needs to accept multiple types of iterators and encompass them inside a unified wrapper. One of the types of iterators I need to support and can is an anonymous function containing the yield keyword  an anonymous generator, essentially.p  pIs there a way in PHP to test whether or not an anonymous function is a generator The following is a list of methods I have tried designed to show the outputs, not how I used themp  precodeanon  function  yield 1 yield 2     build anonymous generator gettypeanon                              object anon instanceof Traversable               0 anon instanceof Iterable                  0 anon instanceof IteratorAggregate         0 anon instanceof Generator                 0 anon instanceof Closure                   1  but doesnt tell me whether or not the closure is actually generator  anon  anon                             invoke, then run the same checks gettypeanon                              object anon instanceof Traversable               1  anon instanceof Iterable                  0 anon instanceof IteratorAggregate         0 anon instanceof Generator                 1  anon instanceof Closure                   0 codepre  pAs you can see above, I can invoke the anonymous function and emthenem determine whether or not the function is a traversable type, but in order to implement this in a lazyloading fashion for example, an anonymous function wrapper around a SQL statement call followed by a yield of each record, I cannot invoke the anonymous function before the foreach iteration.p  pAre there any methods  types in PHP which I am missing that can be used to determine whether or not an anonymous method which has emnotem yet been invoked is a generatorp

Howeverp  ol liIdeally some records should allow some null values for yearli liAs this catalogue table is referenced in subsequent tables it would seem clearer to create a new autoincrementing primary key variable so I can link tables on this one variable rather than joining on a compound of 8 variables and carrying these variables over to the other tables one big INT variable compared to a mix of smallmedium INT variablesli liCan I or should I make a composite key with one auto incrementing big INT ID variable in combination with the year variable there could only be one occurrence of missing per bigint value so I could assign that year to 0 for exampleli ol  pAny advice would be much appreciatedp

Negative 27066 pOk so Im trying to resize an image using php.  I do not have access to install plugins on the server I use at this time.p  pcodeoriginalimagecode is the actual original image that Im going to resize. codewidthcode is another parameter to define codeoriginalwidthcode. The same can be said for codeheightcode and codeoriginalheightcode.p  precodeoriginalwidth  imagesxoriginalimage originalheight  imagesyoriginalimage  maxwidth  thumbwidth maxheight  thumbheight  width  originalwidth height  originalheight codepre  pUsing the presetup above I start to work on this one here. This works but no way to set a max height. For example I pass a max width as codethumbwidthcode and max height as codethumbheightcode and this will work as desired till I then try to go ahead and use an image thats higher than it is wide. Portrait image.  It does not completely fail however it does fail to enforce a max height, rendering an image that can potentially be very high. p  precodeif width gt height  newwidth  thumbwidth divisor  width  thumbwidth newheight  floor height  divisor  else  newheight  thumbheight divisor  height  thumbheight newwidth  floor width  divisor   image  imagecreatetruecolor newwidth, newheight  imagecopyresampled image, originalimage, 0, 0, 0, 0, newwidth, newheight, originalwidth, originalheight  codepre  pAfter trying to understand this and failing after a few hours I came up with the code below which I had gotten from php.net.    As you can see there was a reason I set two sets of variables equal to each other in the presetup part of the code.   Mostly because I can not comprehend calling codemaxwidthcode as codethumbwidthcode in the second code segment. This below works as well until you pass in a parameter though that is larger than the width or height of codeoriginalimagecode.p  precode taller if height gt maxheight      width  maxheight  height  width     height  maxheight    wider if width gt maxwidth      height  maxwidth  width  height     width  maxwidth    image  imagecreatetruecolor width, height  imagecopyresampled image, originalimage, 0, 0, 0, 0, width, height, originalwidth, originalheight  codepre  pIm sorry I cant find a way to do this on my own.  As for this being a duplicate question, Most similar questions end up with [Insert plugin name here] is better use that instead.  I am asking specifically for an answer that does not use other plugins or javascript. Besides GD which is preinstalled on my server. Before I end this question I will say that I am using codeimagejpegimagecode so the use of HTML or CSS is completely forbidden.p

Negative 27066 pIm working on a module to save browser memory and stuck at some point. Taking an example, I have a webpage with two frames. Lets say these two frames are exactly the same web page, which means that they should share DOM and Javascript object. However, the current Firefox browser still treat them differently, which means I have duplicate DOM and Javascript Object in my memory. I want to add a feature that they can share DOM and Javascript Object. I tried the approach to modify the Firefox source code but it introduces a lot of new bugs which makes the browser crash again and again. I know there is a DOM inspector which can find all the DOMs, insert new ones, or delete the existing ones. So I want to ask if I can implement this sharing feature using a browser plugin. Or, I would really appreciate it if you can give me some inspiration.  p

You can select the level of   granularity you need.p blockquote  pBut a KTRegion has only a uuid property. My expectation would be that there is a majorId property within the KTRegion class. But that just doesnt exist. p  pBtw, I know how to monitor with the iOS location manager.

Negative 27066 pI am struggling with a character parenting on moving platforms in 2D game.p  pIm using OnTriggerEnter2D for a detection when player steps on the moving platform. It changes his parent to that platform. With common moving platforms leftright everything works fine, if a character stands on that platform he moves parallel with it, he can walk, jump etc. The problem appears when I use the platform that hangs on two ropes connected with HingeJoint2Ds. The player should swing that platform by walking left and right. When using a keyboard input everything works fine but with a touchinput controller, when player doesnt move, the character remains on one place and doesnt move with that platform. In a hierarchy panel is everything correct, player is a child of platform and the platform is moving but character isnt.p  pFor moving character Im using this part of character controllerp  precodefloat move  Input.GetAxis Horizontal rigidbody2D.velocity  new Vector2 move  maxSpeed, rigidbody2D.velocity.y codepre  pThats the same for keyboard and touch input.

So i apologize in advance if this has been asked before. p  pMy need is to have a script ssh into other devices at different times, to do this I need to store a password.  I dont want to use plain text or base64, but I would be OK with hashing the password and I have no issue doing that.  The issue is I dont know how to get the hash to be sent to the devices as a password.  It just sends the hash and the login gets denied.p  pThis is the hash script that writes to a filep  precodeimport getpass, hashlib, os  pwf  openhashes.txt, w password  getpass.getpass hashpass  hashlib.sha256password.hexdigest pfw.writehashpass codepre  pThis is the 2nd script that I can pull the hash out of the file, but its still a hash. p  precodehashes  openhashes.txt, r for pw in hashes     passwrd  pw.strip   password  passwrd codepre  pThats all fine and dandy, but the I cant login with the hash..  Im sure im doing something fundamentally wrong here.  please let me know.p  pAlso i left out the other ssh code as I didnt think it was relevent.p

I should also note that I am calling the codephpcode page from and AJAX call. p  pSo I think it may have something to do with the Cloud 9 configuration that may not let me use codesetcookiecode to create cookies.

Negative 27066 pHow to set the return value of a Java application started via Eclipse Equinox It implements codeIApplicationcode.

I searched the Internet for an example of its use but could not find one.p  pWhat would happen if our application simply calles codeexitcodep  pIn my current understanding, the return value of a Java application is either the argument of codeexitcode, if that is called, or else the return value of codemaincode.  This return value is available after the application exits, which happens either if codeexitcode is called or else if tha applications last thread terminates.p  pOur application is started from within Eclipse and as standalone tool in GUI and batch mode. p

This is clearly a different operation than what Im looking for  codezcode wont even have the same number of neurons as length as codexcode. What should the second codeconv2dcode command be to reconstruct the original codexcodep

Negative 27066 pI have been told to connect to a customers server using twoway authentication. The server authentication is working smoothly but we are having huge troubles getting the client authentication in place. Let me try to explain our hassles.p  pSome time ago my company bought a certificate at GeoTrust, a certificate which should be perfectly valid to use as our client certificate. Apparently the customer did not manage to add this GeoTrust certificate appropriately to their truststore and we therefore saw the error strongunknowncastrong in our SSL handshake logs every time we tried to connect to their server.p  pInstead the customer asked us to send them a certificate signing request csr and we received back a root certificate as well as a certificate which should be used as our client certificate. After having updated our keystore accordingly we are now seeing the error strongunsupportedcertificatestrong in our SSL handshake logs instead. A closer look at the customer signed client certificate reveals that the new certificate is explicitly having the emServer Authenticationem extension but does not have the emClient Authenticationem extension. I find the correlation between the strongunsupportedcertificatestrong and the missing emClient Authenticationem extension quite obvious, but the customer refuses to accept the missing emClient Authenticationem as a valid explanation and therefore refuses to create a new and properly extended client certificate for us. This is what the customer arguesp  pThe customer has sent me a screen shot of a strongno certificate returnedstrong from his logs and claims that this log entry means that I am passing the client certificate over the wire in a wrong formatp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comPmecF.png altenter image description herep  pIn order to strengthen his assertion about me submitting the client certificate in a wrong format, the customer has sent me the following TCP dump screen shot where a strongpkcsstrong has been circledp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com5MZxE.png altenter image description herep  pAs I see it, the strongpkcs9atemailAddressstrong is just the standard way of including email address information in a certificate and has nothing to do with the certificate being submitted in a wrong format. Also I have found a place in Google where it is mentioned that the strongno certificate returnedstrong log entry can occur in cases where a client certificate is missing the emClient Authenticationem extension.p  pIn order to rule out that it is the strongkeystore.jksstrong and strongtruststore.jksstrong being used by our Java codes which are malformed, I have tried to connect to their server using just an OpenSSL commandp  pcodeopenssl sclient CAfile caroot.cer cert client.cer key client.key connect lthostgtltportgtcodep  pExecution of this OpenSSL command results in the exact same strongunsupportedcertificatestrong error.p  pI would greatly appreciate if someone could help me understand whether we are right or the customer is right. Thanks a lot.p

However, when I need to apply some model changes using dnx . ef migration add we get an error No parameterless constructor defined for this object.p  pOk, no problem.  So we add an additional constructur with no parameters, which we want to only be used by the migration process.

Negative 27066 pI am planning on making a cascade detector for a white cup, a red ball, and a blue puck. With how simple these objects are in their shape, I was wondering if there are any parameter differences I will have to have in the training vs finding complex objects such as cars  faces Also, within the training pos images I have the objects in different lighting conditions and instances where the objects are under shadow.p  pFor training negative images I noticed the image sizes may vary. However, for positive images they MUST be a fixed size. p  pI plan on using 100x100 pos images to help detect the objects from 2030 feet, the 200x200 pos images to detect the objects when I am within 5ft  am directly overhead of the object 3 ft off the ground appx. Does this mean that I will have to train 6 different XMLs 2 for each object as it is trained for 100x100 and 200x200p

Negative 27066 pIm working on a chess program and trying to write tests for the Board class. The top of the spec file contained the following codep  precodedescribe Board do     letboard        Board.new      letemptyboard  Board.newemptytrue      ... end codepre  pHowever, I read that having boolean flags for methods is a code smell because it signifies that the method is responsible for more than one thing. So, I refactored the logic in the initialize method out into two methods in the board class codecreatedefaultboardcode which initializes the contents of the board to the default configuration, and codecreateemptyboardcode.p  pIn the spec file, however, I cant figure out how to call these methods on codeboardcode and codeemptyboardcode, respectively, before the individual tests are run without having to do so within each describe block. Is there a way around thisp

Negative 27066 pIm programming a game but Ive run into a problem regarding cameras Ive made the camera follow an object, but it messes up the coordinates. It seems that no matter where I click, its as if Im always interacting with the same coordinate plane. For example, if I were to click at the point 500,500 from the screens perspective, the world would react correctly. However, if I were to move the player 200,200, the camera would shift accordingly, but if I were to then click at 500,500 from the screens perspective, instead of reacting at 700,700, the game would still react at 500,500, or from the screens perspective, 300,300.  Some photos are below. Green circle is the objects position where the camera and games coordinates align. Red circle is where I click. Blue circle is where the click registers in the game [normal]a hrefhttpi.imgur.comOatfEIk.png relnofollowhttpi.imgur.comOatfEIk.pnga Here Ive moved the object so that the cameras coordinates matches up to the games coordinates. Clicking a point correctly registers in the game. [player moved upright]a hrefhttpi.imgur.com5i0thwi.png relnofollowhttpi.imgur.com5i0thwi.pnga Here Ive moved the object right of the alignment position. Clicking below the object registers the click in the game below the original position. The cameras perspective is wonky how to fix thatp

Negative 27066 pI understand this is a difficult question since it does not only depend on hibernate, but also the particular way we use it.  We use hibernate 4 in our application, probably in a wrong way, but this is how it is.p  pSo we load a whole class hierarchy, with joined subclass tables in one big statement and get in the order of 150K rows that we turn into objects. p  pSince the objects have lots of fields to set 100, we would like to parallelize the loop that iterates over the result set and gets the individual rows. Is this possible in Hibernate Is there a point at which Hibernate has received all the results from the DB and can use the data to hydrate objects, so we can use multithreading to speed up fetching a large result set p  pDoes this make sense or is it better to change the data structure and the mapping to get rid of multitable joinsp  pAs it is, loading 150K of those objects takes a minute or 0.3 msentity. We have simpler tables with more entries that we load one order of magnitude faster at 0.02 msentity. We do not load other entities after the initialization phase which takes more than 5 minutes for the whole DB. p  pIf we remove joins by unexposing the class hierarchy to the DB and switch to a compositionbased data structure, we may get more simple table loads instead of complex joins at the cost of multiple table loads instead one join that has those loads combined into one. p  pBut the problem remains if we have this many rows to load and accordingly many setters to call when filling out the fields for each object, can this be done in parallelp

Trying to implemented Rete pattern match. all the common LHSs are shared between rules. done whenever any LHS gets satisfied a function counts the percentage.done But, insted of calling the function per rule, Can it be possible for the rules to announce it Since, all the information is stored. it just needs to be called.

Negative 27066 pWe use closure library and closure compiler, and we want to use closure templates.p  pBut closure templates havent got inheritance. Thats really a problem for us.p  pAs I understand, the reason why closure templates dont have inheritance, is because templates must be simple, and easy to read.p  pBut how can you live without inheritance in big projectsp  pFor example, we have a template file embutton.soyem that generates button with public template codeproject.createButtoncode and private templates codeproject.createOpenTagcode, codeproject.createCSSClassescode, codeproject.createAttributescode, codeproject.createContentcode, codeproject.createCloseTagcode.p  pWe have JavaScript class codeproject.Buttoncode, and we have codeproject.ButtonCirclecode perhaps this separate class codeproject.ButtonCirclecode seems unnecessary, but its just an example which extends codeproject.Buttoncode.p  pcodeproject.ButtonCirclecode needs little changes made in codeproject.createButtoncode template.p  pOf course we can add new functionality to codeproject.createButtoncode, but its a very bad idea, because such approach will create monster templates in the future.p  pOr we can create public template codeproject.createCircleButtoncode in file embuttoncircle.soyem, call all private templates from codeproject.createButtoncode in it, and when we need to override one of these private templates, for example codeproject.createCSSClassescode, we just create new private template in embuttoncircle.soyem with name codeproject.createCSSClassesCirbleButtoncode.p  pYet in this case we need to copypaste all content from codeproject.createButtoncode to codeproject.createCircleButtoncode. Thats terrible.p  pAlso we tried using Delegate Templates, but its not suited for inheritance.p  pWhat is approach towards this problemp

Negative 27066 pIm trying to figure out a way of capturing, and storing a click event, in a way that allows me to replay that exact event again once the page has been reloaded.p  pInitially I thought to capture the selector of the target thats been clicked, but what happens if the element doesnt have any identifying idclasses Also assuming I have a generic on click listener, intercepting all click events, what happens if the page simply contains 10 codeltbuttongtClick Meltbuttongtcode elements  how can I store which one received the clickp  pHeres an example of my generic click listenerp  precodefunction handleClickevent     Store the click event in a way that can be later replayed   document.onclick  handleClick codepre  pAnother requirement is that I cannot assume the screen size is the same, so I cant simply record x amp y coordinates  this is because the replaying of the event may occur in a browser with different viewport dimensions.p  pAny ideas, pointers or whether or not this is even possible would be greatly appreciatedp  pstrongUpdatestrong Just to clarify, by storing the event I dont mean a mechanism cookiedatabase etc, but rather the informationdata its self that could be stored to identify and replay the captured event.p
