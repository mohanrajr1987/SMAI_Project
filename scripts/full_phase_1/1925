Positive 1925 pI am working with Java of late, and was wondering whether there was any kind of interface implementation derivation in Java. My preferred programming language is Haskell, which is in many ways antithetical to Java, but one feature that I was wondering whether Java had anything like is the ability to derive interface implementations of compound types from the interface implementations of their parameters. For example, in Haskellp  precodedata Pair k v  Pair k v  instance Ord k gt Ord Pair k v where     compare Pair x  Pair x   compare x x codepre  pThis allows you to order a codePaircode if its first parameter can be ordered, without explicitly requiring that to be the case. However, the closest I can come  to this in Java is through explicit requirementp  precodeclass PairltK extends ComparableltKgt, Vgt extends ComparableltPairltK,Vgtgt      K k     V v     public int compareToPairltK,Vgt p          return k.compareTop.k       codepre  pWithout a way of leaving the comparability to be inferred, it is impossible for me to implement a BST of pairs without ensuring that all pairs have a comparable first element, so I cannot implement any kind of Map where the first element is not explicitly required to be Comparable. Is there any way around this, other than creating a method of my BST class that attempts to compare the generic type by casting it first as comparable, and then as a Pair with a comparable key, comparing whenever comparability is possiblep

Negative 1925 pSo there is the guy on the internet who wrote a ton of code and stored it all on github.  One day, said guy just up and disappears deleting all of his repositories.  Thankfully, there were many forks of his main projects but still there were many smaller repos that were not forked.

However, there is one problem what I have are the contents of the individual repos .git directories.  p  pI am unclear how to leverage these .git dirs in order to effectively fork them, thus creating fairly complete mirrors of their corresponding repos.p  pAny guidancep  pmp
Negative 1925 pI have a list of Product objects  as rows , each object has several data fields  like product id, product family, etc   as columns. I managed to create a table model subclassing QAbstractTableModel, and display the datas in a QTableView.p  pWhat i want is provide a grouped view of the model in a treelike structure. For example I want to group the products by their family id, so the tree should contain in the first level the groups  family id  and their childs are the products having that family id.p  pAny ideasp  pPS The need of multiple groupings  group by family id, and group them by another column, and so on  shows me that the model should be a tree. The root nodes indicates the groups, and then the childs are the group members. The multiple grouping can be achieved by multilevel trees.p  pThen my transformed question is the following How can I implement a special QTableView class that displays only the trees leafs  at a given level   Because actually leafs are the real objects we would like to see in a grid p  pI can use setRootIndex in the tableview, but it doesnt solve anything, other leafs are not displayed.p  pI was digging a little bit, and found that in QTableViewpaintEvent, when displaying each row and column, the actual item is fetched like p  pconst QModelIndex index  dmodelindexrow, col, drootp  pwhere droot is the root node given by setRootIndex. This should be embedded in a treetraversal code, and everything would be fine. But how could I avoid to reimplement the whole paintEvent method p

Negative 1925 pI encountered following weird behavior yesterday. It seems a compiler bug to me or is there a something that Ive missed I was wrapping Facebook Connect for iPhones ObjectiveC classes with ObjectiveC to C adaptor classes, so that they could be used from our own OpenGLC code more conveniently.p  pThe following code reveals the problem. In the first variant below, the compiler compiles but messes up the vtables and thus wrong method is called. In the second variant, we get a compiler error which indicates that gcc is confused.p  pComments try to explain the situation in more detail.p  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt import ltFoundationFoundation.hgt   An abstract C interface class Foocpp  public     virtual void foo  0    Another abstract C interface class Barcpp  public     virtual void bar  0     An ObjectiveC to C adaptor.   It takes a C interface Foo. When its dofoo method is called it  delegates call to Foofoo. interface Fooobjc  NSObject      Foocpp foocpp  end  implementation Fooobjc   idinitFoocppfoo      self  [super init]     if self          foocpp  foo           return self    void dofoo      stdcout ltlt dofoo      foocppgtfoo  end    Another ObjectiveC to C adaptor.  interface Barobjc  NSObject     Barcpp barcpp  end   implementation Barobjc   idinitBarcppbar      self  [super init]     if self          barcpp  bar          return self    void dobar      stdcout ltlt dobar      barcppgtbar  end    Main class implements both abstract C interfaces which will  confuse the compiler as we shall see.   It constructs two ObjectiveC to C adaptors as a members and  tries to pass itself as a C delegate for these adaptors. class Main  public Foocpp, public Barcpp  public     Fooobjc foo     Barobjc bar      Main           We try to construct two objectivec to c adaptors Fooobjc and          Barobjc.

When dobar is called, we expect          bar to be called via Barobjc, but instead          foo is called from both adaptors.          Output is             dofoo foo             dobar foo   Calls wrong method          foo  [[Fooobjc alloc] initthis]         bar  [[Barobjc alloc] initthis]          [foo dofoo]         [bar dobar] else           Now, this variant tries to help the compiler by passing           this via a variable of the correct interface type.          It actually reveals the confusion that the compiler          is having. Seems like a bug in the compiler.

Instead it merrily goes along trying to create the new controller to handle the request which fails and I end up being redirected to our custom error page.p  pLooking at the callstack, I would think this needs to happen somewhere around codeMvcHandler.System.Web.IHttpHandler.ProcessRequestcode or codeMvcHandler.ProcessRequestcode .. certainly before codeDefaultControllerFactory.CreateControllercode is called.p  pHas anyone else had to handle this situationp  pstrongUpdatestrong To be honest, I think this approach is probably incorrect and the better idea is to handle forms authentication timeout on the clientside with some javascript on the master page. I could then redirect to an action that will clear the session and return them to the login page similar to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions859309sessionendinaspnetmvcwhat is described herea.p

Negative 1925 pIm running a software called Fishbowl inventory and it is running on a firebird database Windows server 2003 at this time the fishbowl software is running extremely slow when more then one user accesses the software.

Negative 1925 pI see a lot of objectivec code that just defines local constants it needs, and then proceeds on its merry way.  The problem is that, as far as I know, defines arent scoped.

Negative 1925 pI dont know if its simply because pageloads take a little time, or the way servlets have an abstraction framework above the bare metal of HTTP, or just because of the Enterprise in JaveEE, but in my head I have the notion that a servletbased app is inherently adding overhead compared to a Java app which simply deals with sockets directly.p  pstrongForget webpages, imagine instead a Java server app where you send it a question over an HTTP request and it looks up an answer from memory and returns the answer in the responsestrong. You can easily write a Java socketbased app which does this, you can also do a servlet approach and get away from the bare metal of sockets.p  pIs there any measurable performance impact to be expected implementing the same approach using Servlets rather than a custom socketbased HTTP listening appp  pAnd yes, I am hazy on the exact data sent in HTTP requests and I know its a vague question. Its really about whether servlet implementations have lots of layers of indirection or anything else that would add up to a significant overhead per call, where by significant I mean maybe an additional 0.1s or more.p

Negative 1925 pThe majority of my questions Ive asked here so far on StackOverflow have been how to implement individual concepts and techniques towards developing a softwarebased NES clone via the XNA environment.p  pThe small samples that Ive thrown together on my PC work relatively great and everything.  Except I hit a brick wall.  emHow do I merge all of these samples together.emp  pHaving proofofconcept is amazing, except when you need it to go beyond just that.  I now have samples strewn about that Im trying to merge, some of them incomplete.  And now Im stuck with the chickenandtheegg situation of where I would like to incorporate these samples together, to make sure they work, but I cannot without test data.  And I dont have tools to create test data, because theyd need to be based off of the individual pieces that need to be put together.p  pIn my mind, Im having nightmares with circular reference.  For my sample data, I am hoping to save it in XML and write a specification  and then make sample data by hand  but Im too paranoid of manually creating an XML file full of incorrect data and blaming it on my code, or viceversa.  It doesnt help that the endresult of my work is graphicoriented, which makes it interseting how a graphic on the screen can be visualized in XML Nodes.p  pI guess, my question is this  What design patterns and disciplines exist in the coding world that address this type of concern  Ive always relied on bruteforce coding and restarting a project with a whole new code base in attempts to further along my goals, but I doubt that would be the best way to do so.p  pWithin my college career, the majority of my programming was to work on simple projects that came out of a book, or with a given correct data set and a verifyable result.  I dont have that, as my own design documents that I am going by could be terribly wrong.p

Negative 1925 pIm curious whats the view on things that compile into javascript e.g. GWT, Script and WebSharper and their like. These seem to be fairly niche components aimed at allowing folks to write javascript without writing javascript.p  pPersonally Im comfortable writing javascript using JQueryPrototypeExtJS or some other such library and view things like GWT these as needless abstractions that may end up limiting what a developer needs to accomplish or bestcase providing a very longwinded workaround.

Negative 1925 pFor this post, Im looking for more conceptual help than a specific technical solution although anything helps.  p  pBasically, Ive been asked to automate an XML HTTP POST through an application layer.  Ive never done anything like this before, so Im a bit confused where to even start on a high level.  It would be great if someone could share with me what steps I would need to take to accomplish this task.  Here is some more background informationp  pCurrently, our company uses an application well call it Program.exe on a daily basis to design frontend interfaces with a visual editor.  Once the interface is completed, Program.exe creates JSP files and submits them to the server.  Unfortunately, the process of creating and sending the files takes an awfully large number of clicks, so management would like to automate this process by running a script that would take the project files from Program.exe, convert them to JSP and accurately submit them through the application layer of Program.exe to the appropriate server.p  pSo far I have used WireShark to sniff the packets of a simple transaction using Program.exe and discovered a number of HTTPXML POST packets that contained XML data with information like Current File Name User name and more.  Curiously, all of these data items were submitted in different packets, not all in one.  There are also multiple references to SOAP. I have almost no knowledge of SOAP, except that it existsp  pAt this point, this is all of the information I have.  I am unsure what steps I should take from here.  I would really like to understand this process on a high level, so any conceptual information would be greatly appreciated.  p  pFinally, we use C primarily for these sorts of tasks, so if someone would like to share a technical solution feel free to use C.p  pThank you all very much.p

Negative 1925 pI have two codeNSMenuscode with the same codeNSMenuItemscode. Only one codeNSMenuItemcode in its codeNSMenucode should be selected. Kind of like an codeNSMatrixcode. So I connected each codeNSMenuItemcode to the same action and added an iVar for the index of the item with the codeNSOnStatecode. Inside the method I set the state of the item with the old index to codeNSOffStatecode and the new one to codeNSOnStatecode, then I set the old index to the new index. This works just fine for one of the two codeNSMenuscode. But I would like to sync them both. I can add IBOutlets for every NSMenu and then set the states inside the method since I have access to both codeNSMenuscode. But this feels kind of redundant.. strongNotestrong Im also planning to save the index in the user defaults so maybe it can be achieved by an codeNSUserDefaultsControllercodep

Negative 1925 pem[Edit]  I figured out how to do this on my own.  I posted my solution in the hope that it will save someone else a few days of googling.  If you are a WPF guru, please look at my solution and let me know if there is a better  more elegant  more efficient way to do this.  In particular, I am interested in knowing what I dont know... how is this solution going to screw me down the road The problem really boils down to exposing inner control properties.emp  pProblem I am creating some code to autogenerate a databound GUI in WPF for an XML file.  I have an xsd file that can help me determine the node types, etc.  Simple KeyValue elements are easy.p  pWhen I parse this elementp  precodeltKeygtvalueltKeygt codepre  pI can create a new KeyValueControl and set the codeDataContextcode to this element.  The KeyValue is defined as a UserControl and just has some simple bindings on it. It works great for any simple XElement.p  pThe XAML inside this control looks like thisp  precodeltLabel ContentBinding PathName gt  ltTextBox TextBinding PathValue gt codepre  pThe result is a line that has a label with the element name and a text box with the value that I can edit.p  pNow, there are times where I need to display lookup values instead of the actual value.  I would like to create a KeyValueComboBox similar to the above KeyValueControl but be able to specify based on information in the file the ItemsSource, Display and Value paths.  The Name and Value bindings would be the same as the KeyValueControl.p  pI dont know if a standard user control can handle this, or if I need to inherit from Selector.  p  pThe XAML in the control would look something like thisp  precodeltLabel ContentBinding PathName gt  ltComboBox SelectedValueBinding PathValue           ItemsSourceBinding [BOUND TO THE ItemsSource PROPERTY OF THIS CUSTOM CONTROL]           DisplayMemberPathBinding [BOUND TO THE DisplayMemberPath OF THIS CUSTOM CONTROL]           SelectedValuePathBinding [BOUND TO THE SelectedValuePath OF THIS CUSTOM CONTROL]gt codepre  pIn my code, I would then do something like this assuming that this node is a Thing and needs to display a list of Things so the user can select the IDp  precodevar myBoundComboBox  new KeyValueComboBox myBoundComboBox.ItemsSource  getThingsList myBoundComboBox.DisplayMemberPath  ThingName myBoundComboBox.ValueMemberPath  ThingID myBoundComboBox.DataContext  thisXElement ... myStackPanel.Children.AddmyBoundComboBox codepre  pSo my questions arep  p1 Should I inherit my KeyValueComboBox from Control or Selectorp  p2 If I should inherit from Control, how do I expose the inner Combo Boxs ItemsSource, DisplayMemberPath, and ValueMemberPath for bindingp  p3 If I need to inherit from Selector, can someone provide a small example of how I might get started with that  Again, Im new to WPF so a nice, simple example would really help if thats the road I need to take.p

Negative 1925 pIm contemplating a project where Ill be required to make use of what is variously called the asynchronous mode, or the duplex mode, or the callback mode of SOAP webservice. In this mode, the caller of the service provides in the SOAP header a replyto address, and the service, instead of returning the output of the call in the HTTP response, creates a separate HTTP connection to this replyto address and posts the response message to it. This is normally achieved in WCF using a CompositeDuplexBinding, like sop  precodeltbinding nameasynchttptextgt     ltcompositeDuplex clientBaseAddresshttp192.168.10.1231234async gt     ltoneWay gt     lttextMessageEncoding messageVersionSoap12WSAddressing10 gt     lthttpTransport useDefaultWebProxyfalse gt ltbindinggt codepre  pThis results in not one, but two HTTP connections per call one from the client to the service, and then one from the service back to the client. From the point of view of the service implementation, nothing changes, you have a method that implements the interface method, and you take in the request and return the response. Fantastic, this is what I need, almost.p  pIn my situation, the request and response can be separated by anything from minutes to days. I need a way to decouple the request and the response, and store the state message, response URI, whatever until I have enough information to respond at a later time or even never, under certain circumstances.p  pIm not terribly excited about having my methods essentially paused for up to days at a time, along with the required silly timeout values if theyre even accepted as valid, but I dont know how to go about putting a system like this together.p  pIn order to be completely clear, Im implementing a set of standards provided by a standards body, so I do not have flexibility to change SOAP message semantics or alter protocol implementations. This sort of interaction is exactly what was intended when the ReplyTo header was implemented in WSAddressing.p  pHow would you do it Perhaps Workflow Foundation enables this sort of thingp

It calls runCallback in the separate process     runCallbackuniqueId   def setupCallbackfunc, delay     uniqueId  idfunc     funcs[uniqueId]  func     proc  multiprocessing.Processtargetfunc, argsdelay, uniqueId     proc.start     return unqiueId codepre  pHere is how I want it to workp  precodedef aFunc     return None  setupCallbackaFunc, 10  some code that gets run before aFunc is called   aFunc runs 10s later  codepre  pThere is a gotcha here, because I want this to be a bit more complex.  Basically when the code in the main process is done running... I want to examine the funcs dict and then run any of the callbacks that have not yet run.  This means that runCallback also needs to remove entries from the funcs dict... the funcs dict is not shared with the seperate processes, so I think runCallback needs to be called in the main process   p

Negative 1925 pI am trying to create a simple annotated timeline from a PostgreSQL database using a server side PHP script to access the data from the database, then a JavaScript client side script to display the graph.

Negative 1925 pemProblememp  pIm trying to display a small amount of text using complex scripts such as Arabic and Bengali on mobile devices specifically Android, BlackBerry phones, and BlackBerry PlayBook. The app is a hrefhttpssites.google.comsiteficksworkshopallergytraveler relnofollowAllergy Travelera These devices both fail to correctly display the text, but for different reasons.p  pOn Android and PlayBook, I can supply a font in which case the characters display, but the characters are not connected correctly. Each character displays without considering the context.p  pOn BlackBerry, the device doesnt have appropriate fonts. I can supply a font, but the font file far exceeds the maximum font size 70kB.p  pemProposed Solutionemp  pI think the process of correctly using context to display a word is called reshaping. Presumably, this takes the text and returns an alternative set of characters to display. My proposed solution is to do this reshaping in advance. On Android, this would ensure the text correctly uses the context, and on BlackBerry, this would allow me to remove unused characters, and reduce the font size.p  pemQuestionemp  pAre there any APIs to do this reshaping or any other suggestions Im willing to use any technology on Windows or Linux eg a Win32 API, Perl, Python, Java, ...p  pThanks for all the suggestions.p

Negative 1925 pMy first question here on the Stack.  Forgive me for the bad explanation in advance.  p  pI am working on my first MVVM application Silverlight.  I have a custom user control that contains a ListBox to show navigation items.  This control is placed in my main xaml page.  I dont know if I need to create a composite view model my main page view model with a view model especially for the custom control in it or if there is some way to elevate the ListBox properties that I need to bind to.p  pThrough XAML I dont know how to bind, lets say, the ItemsSource property of the ListBox inside the custom control to my main page viewmodel.  Basically, Im at the point that I am questioning my design decision for trying to bind the custom control through my main page view model.p  pWhat I have done so far is create dependency properties for the custom control and try to tunnel those dependency properties down to the ListBox properties.

Negative 1925 pI am developing a system in Access talking to a Sql Server backend. I can connect with two separate accounts A and B so that I can control permissions.  In particular I have a view which is accessed via a pass through query which is denied to A but allowed by B.p  pNormally selection of A or B as the login is related to which Access Security Group the user belongs in, but I have set it up so that people in the Admins group ie me read the login from an internal access table.  I have also created a form and associated code that allows an Admin to change this value.p  pThis all works great and does its job perfectly  strongprovided I start up Access from scratchstrong. p  pIt detects I am admin, reads the last value I set in the internal table, connects to the server with the correct login string I loop deleting and recreating all the tabledefs using this new connection string and then displays my first form.  I navigate to a button that runs the pass through query.  When I click that button it recreates the pass through query, by deleting one with the same name and recreating it with the correct connection string A or B login before then running it to output results. If I am A, then it fails with a permission error which I display and inform the user about, if I am B it works and I get the results.p  pI have added a system to attempt to change this on the fly for testing purposes.  Having changed who Admin should login as by writing to an internal table, it recalls the startup code, which loops through deleting and recreating tabledefs and then puts me back at the intial form.p  pHOWEVER  If I now navigate to the button that runs my permission controlled query, it still deletes and recreates the query def from scratch, but when I run it, it seems to run in the context of the SQL Server Login it set when I first started access, and not the new SQL Server Login I have just recreated everything with. So the query will run when it shouldnt of visa versa.p  pIf I exit Access and try again  it starts working properly again.p  pThe only conclusion I can draw from this is that somewhere inside of Access it is caching the ODBC connection string  and instead of using the new one is  using the old.p  pSo my question is  is my conclusion correct, and if so how can I tell Access to clear its cache.p  pI am developing in Access 2010  for a system that will ultimately be running in an Access 2000 environment  so the file format is an .mdb in the Access 2000 format.p

Negative 1925 pSo Ive been working with 2 different Localstorage application for a task Ive been given. The one is a todo list and the other one is notes which both work on the same html file.p  pNow, the todo list have 3 localstrorage keys. One for the value of the todo. Second for the order of the todos which is first, sec, third etc and Third how many todos you have in general. So thats 3 different values.p  pFor the notes is 1 localstorage Key with all its values. see image belowp  pNow the problem is If for example I have 3 notes and then I add a todo I get this on the localstoragep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comAYjqK.jpg altenter image description herep  pwhich this is working fine.p  pBut, if I add another two notes, I get this p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com9yQ5y.jpg altenter image description herep  pwhich is logical although strongthe last two notes doesnt show.strong p  pAnother example img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comzhW9b.jpg altenter image description herep  pstrongThis will not show any notes although there are 4.strongp  pIm not sure how to explain this but basically what happens is that what ever is written on the localstorage after a todoID, doesnt show but note that the todoList keeps working perfectly.p  pIm not pretty sure what the problem is but what I think it could be its the way the keys are being loaded. maybe p  pSo here is how I load the notesp  precodevar initStickies  function initStickies      ltdiv gt,           text  ,          class  addsticky,         click  function   createSticky      .prependTodocument.body     initStickies  null , openStickies  function openStickies      initStickies ampamp initStickies     for var i  0 i lt localStorage.length i          createStickyJSON.parselocalStorage.getItemlocalStorage.keyi       codepre  pand this is how I load the todolist p  precodeorderList  localStorage.getItemtodoorders  orderList  orderList  orderList.split,  []  for j  0, k  orderList.length j lt k j      itemList.append         ltli id  orderList[j]  gt          ltspan classeditablegt           localStorage.getItemorderList[j]           ltspangt lta hrefgtXltagtltligt       codepre  pWhat the problem could be Does anyone had this problem beforep  pThanks alot for reading and sorry for the big post.

Negative 1925 pIm sort of new to rendering graphics with GDI...p  pI made a paint program, and it works fine, its just that it causes a lot of annoying screen flickering. I will admit my paint code is not really optimized lack of time, but it shouldnt be super inefficient either, so Im puzzled.p  pWhat Im basically doing is creating a compatible DC on init, then create a compatible bitmap. Then I select it into the compatible DC, and paint to the compatible DC. Then I use BitBlit to copy it to the window hDC...p  pCould anyone tell me the possible causes for this screen tearing EDIT btw, screen flickering only occurs during the drawing of a path before the

From everything Ive read this is supposed to work if I use codeAttachConsolecode.p  pstrongReprostrongp  pHeres a minimal sample  Note that the project is set to be a codeWindows Applicationcodep  precodeusing System using System.ComponentModel using System.Runtime.InteropServices using System.Windows.Forms  class Program      [STAThread]     static void Mainstring[] args              if AttachConsole1                      MessageBox.Show                 new Win32ExceptionMarshal.GetLastWin32Error                     .ToString                                    Console.WriteLineTest           [DllImportkernel32.dll, SetLastError  true, ExactSpelling  true]     private static extern bool AttachConsoleint processId  codepre  ul liWhen I run this from a command prompt, I dont get an error, but I dont get any console output either.  emThis is the problememli liIf I add extra message boxes anywhere in the execution flow of the app, the message box gets displayed.

Negative 1925 pI am struggling with the problem described a hrefhttponjava.comonjava20060913dontlethibernatestealyouridentity.html relnofollowherea. I have a persistent class that I want to make collectionsafe by overriding codehashCodecode and codeequalscode. Because my entity doesnt have a good natural key, these methods will need to use the codeIdcode field, so I need to assign the id at the time of object creation. But now Hibernate will need another way to determine whether an instance is transient or persistent, and the logical field to use for that is codeVersioncode.p  pI know I could do this in an hbm file using codeltversion unsavedvaluenullgtcode. But Ive been using annotations, which dont support the codeunsavedvaluecode attribute. If I just use the plain codeVersioncode annotation, will Hibernate be smart enough to use it to determine the persistence state Ive checked the Hibernate documentation, but its a little ambiguous.p  pDoes anyone know of a solution other than moving the mapping for the entire class into an hbm filep

Negative 1925 pHello and thanks for lookingp  h1Backgroundh1  pI am designing a greenfield application using .NET4 wC that will be packaged forby Azure and run in the cloud.p  pOne of the main functions of this application will be to listen for requests coming out of other crossdomain apps throughout the Internet, authenticate the request method for doing that has not yet been determined, and then respond with data in the form of a JSON object.  p  pThis application will serve up data on a subscriptionAPI basis and I will have no control or advanced knowledge of where future requests will originate.p  pIn the past, I have created a MVC3 project in my solution as a service layer which simply listened on certain URLs e.g. mydomain.comjson for data requests from the emsameem domain.  In response to the request, I would grab some data from SQL entities actually, serialize it into JSON and then return it as codereturn Contentfoo,applicationjsoncode via the action result.  This has worked GREAT.p  pThe JSON will likely emalwaysem be requested via ajax running on a client machine, so I am not that worried about threads being blocked on the server.p  pPlease note, I know very little about WCF service projects and very little about Azure.p  h1Questionh1  pAlthough I am very happy with the way my MVC JSON service pattern works in other applications, are there any major reasons I should NOT do this  Major reasons I emshouldem be using WCF instead  p  pI am tempted to subscribe to the if it aint broke dont fix it philosophy, but I know that is not best practice.  p  pI look forward to reviewing the advice of the brilliant minds on Stack Overflow regarding this matterp  pThanks,p  pMattp

Negative 1925 pI have a C program spanning across dozens of files. My aim is to write a function that when called will save all the global variables to some file and exit to the OS command line in windows. Later, I need the program to load the global variables from the file and continue running.p  pThe program is a single threaded exe which does not load any DLLs.p  pThe straightforward way to solve this is to make a list of all the global variables assuming Ill convert statics to globals and just dump them to a file.

Negative 1925 pI have an app that uses Core Data and it gets its ManagedObjectContext by using UIManagedObject.

Ive been able to do the instantiation using an object RSAParameters, loaded with the byte[]s for Modulus and Exponent derived from this public key string using an OpenSSL shell command. But since this public key may change in the future I want to be able to store it in its original form in a database. There must be a more straightforward way of dealing with this.p  pA lot of the examples Ive read so far avoid this problem by exporting and importing the generated private and public keys to and from a keycontainer object and use it in the same piece of code and thus not transferring the key in some string form out of memory. Some people have expressed the same problem, both here on StackOverflow and on other sites, but I have not been able to find a satisfying answer yet.p  pAny ideas are more than welcome.p  pBackground info My communication partner computes a 20byte SHA1hash from an input string of variable length, composed of the information contained in several fields of an ASCII encoded message. This hash is then RSAsigned with my partners private key and sent along with the ASCII message to me. Upon arrival, I compute the SHA1 hash myself, using the same fields from the ASCII message and then try to verify if these fields were not altered by calling VerifyHash.p  pThe key is provided in 2 forms regular and noNL.

Negative 1925 pI am implementing a basic board game in Java and that I am having difficulty deciding the pros and cons of in solving. I am already successfully making use of the Command Pattern to enable undo functionality in the game, and originally intended to implement game savingloading by serializing the entire set of game model objects. p  pHowever I realised that as the game is a board game with no random elements involved and always initialising with the same state, I could implement saveload functionality by simply serializing the object containing the command stack and the commands themselves up to that point, and then reexecute all of the commands in order to bring the game up to the saved position.p  pMy current design does not allow me to do this, as my Commands hold references to the object instances that form my boards tiles and pieces, which I believe is best OO practice. That would mean I would also have to serialise those model objects, which would defeat the purpose of just serialising the commands and executing them.

Negative 1925 pIs this the only way to achieve scale with map amp reduce p  pWhat I hate about this is that persistence ignorance is all jacked up. It should be that HDFS expose itself via an interface, you shouldnt care about what language its written on, or why. Just like how you can write ODBC and itll plug into Oracle, Sql Server and what not running on any operating system.p  pI am aware of Hive, but I do not think it is well suited for heavier computation such as matrix manipulation, Gaussian analysis, etc.p  pThe other problem is writing complex instruction set and the dependency such thing entails. It means you have to figure out how to port your code and install it along with any dependencies onto the server itself. This is a lot of infrastructural cost And its also difficult to do inside a Platform as a service Paas cloud.p  pAn example using Hadoop streaming for instance. You gotta make sure your binary is compiled against the target server kernel. eg. Linux vs. windows etc. You also gotta make sure that all your projects reference the same version of the dependencies. Again this is bull. If you have multiple teams this is a lot of coordination and overhead. We moved to SOA to get away from some of these.p  pI understand the data is heavier than the code, and its much more efficient to put the code next to the data itself, but is this the only way to achieve scale Do you absolutely have to sacrifice Seperation of Concern when working with the amount of data Hadoop is supposed to address.p  pFor example, yes you can embed CLR into Sql server, but in practice this is reserved only for the truly serious bottle neck that could not be resolved in any other way. aka  its a hack or an antipattern if you want to call it that. Do this too much, and your product becomes heavily coupled to Microsoft Sql Server. You cant just swap it out for Oracle or what not as the biz need changes. Not good. p  pAlso in all of computing history we have always bring the data to the code, not the other way around. Eg. you load the data from database to Orm, to service, to memory, to cache, and then to the instruction set. This stood for a reason namely SOCp  pMy question is, whether map amp reduce   no sql is one of those cases where you just have to put the code next to the data, as opposed to loading the data as needed to the instruction set eg. a load balanced service somewhere in the cloud.p

Negative 1925 pIm trying to parse a lisplike language which has some syntactic sugar for common functions. For example, the plus function can be written as  1 2 or as 1  2. Im thinking that eliminating syntactic sugar before trying to interpret the language would significantly facilitate the interpretation process, because then, the only evaluation rule that needs to be implemented is going to be that of a function call, and all infix operators would have to have corresponding builtin functions. I was thinking I could create a parser that will iterate over the tokens received from the lexer, and reorder them to put the expression into prefix notation. But this would require the output of the parser to also be a list of tokens. Is that possible in Spirit.Qi As far as I understand, Spirit.Qi builds a hierarchical structure not a linear list of tokens.p
Negative 1925 pWe have a system that generates android apps automatically. The users enter in our website and login in their accounts and the users make a description of wich functionalities want and our system automatically generates the signed android apk and publishes on market.p  pThe apps are published on the market with our developer account, not with the user account.p  pSuch users would need PUSH notifications, for example, through GCM, to their applications. Therefore, we need to know if there is any way to automate the process so that users only have to enter on our website their google accounts and the message they want to send their applications, and our system must automatically send the messages to the phones that uses the user applications.p  pYou have to remember and highlight the following factorsp  ul lipApplications are published in the market under our developer account.pli lipUsers who have created their apps through our system have their own google accounts not developer accounts and want to send their messages from their accounts of Google and to its applications only, not those of others users and not using our google developer account.pli lipThe whole process should be automatic and transparent to the user, since they should only provide these data, their google account, the message they want to send, and the app that must receive the message.

Negative 1925 pA critical bugfix update to one of my apps was recently rejected due to an alleged violation of the iCloud Data Storage Guidelines.p  pHeres how my app stores data hasnt been a problem since the first version of my app was approved in 2009p  ol liOn startup, it copies a starter SQLite3 database from the app bundle to the Documents folder.li liThe database contains the basic schema and some example data so the user can see how to use the app. Its small  just under 3MB.li liThe users future work is then saved only in this database file. They may delete or keep the samples, they may add tons of their own data, but that database file will always be there.li ol  pAn update earlier this year was rejected for the same reason, but when I gave them the explanation above, the app status changed from Rejected to In Review to Processing for App Store. They didnt send me any explanation, so I thought it was just a misunderstanding on the reviewers part.p  pThis time, the reviewer responded to my explanation by simply saying that nonusergenerated data shouldnt be stored in iCloud and my update remains in the Rejected state.p  pBut I dont understand what Im supposed to do here. Because all of the users work is kept in the database, its not an option for me to exclude this from iCloud backup or store it in a Cache folder. Also, I cant really cleanly separate usergenerated from nonusergenerated data because the app works from the same database file. The initial, nonusergenerated data will be quickly replaced with the users own data, though the filename and directory location of the database will remain the same.p  pAnd even if there were no sample data in the database, any databasebacked app will still have to generate an empty database when it starts  even if the only thing it holds is the apps database schema.p  pThis must be a very common problem, but unfortunately its not okay for me to just turn off backup  users put a lot of work into the data they store in my app, and iCloud backup is very important to them.p  pWhat options do I have at this point Heres what I can seep  ol lipContact Apple again and try to explain whats going on.pli lipCan I set the files backup attribute to NO and then only toggle it to YES when the user makes their first change Is that okay technically and okay with Applepli lipRemove my example data from the database. This will be really bad for usability and will increase my support load, but Im willing to do it if it will get my update approved. However, Ill still have to create a stub database at startup to hold the empty database schema, so Im not sure if that will even make a difference in the approval process.pli lipCry.pli ol  pAnyone have any advice I have to imagine that there are lots of other apps that use a database the same way mine does, but dont have the option of just disabling backup. p  pIts also very depressing that any changes I make will require another round of testing and app review, which will set back my critical update an additional 2  3 weeks. p  pstrongUPDATEstrong There may be another option can I simply save the file in codeLibrarycode instead of codeDocumentscode, since their problem seems to be specifically with the use of the Documents folder Will the file be backed up if its stored in codeLibrarycodep  pstrongUPDATE 2strong The thing I find most confusing is that any databasebacked app even if it uses Core Data, I assume will have to create a database file containing at least the apps schema. Is the problem just that the size of my database is too big Because I cant see how any databasebacked application can avoid having to create a database at startup.p  pstrongUPDATE 3strong Im using a custom SQLite interaction layer  not Core Data. Also, the example data consists of starter images, which the user will probably end up deleting as they start using the app.p

Negative 1925 pIm using Apples view controllers quite alot in my app like codeMFMessageComposeViewControllercode and codeABPeoplePickerNavigationControllercode.

Negative 1925 pI am implementing a user theory plugin. I want to test inconsistency in the user theory to prune some models. p  pMore specifically, in my theory, codexcode is a variable of the user sort of set and codefcode is the function returning the size of the set. I have two assertions codex  set1 OR x  set2code and codef x gt 2code. Suppose the size of codeset1code is 1 and the size of codeset2code is 3. p  pIn the search, Z3 goes with codex  set1code first. So I can add another assertion codef x  1code, which will be inconsistent in the INT part. I want to test the inconsistency so that I can negate the current assignment, let Z3 backtrack and try the other option.p  pMy question is that how I can do that.p  pI tried 3 approaches p  p1 Add the assertion codef x  1code directly using codeZ3theoryassertaxiomcode. Then the search terminates immediately returning UNSAT.p  p2 I tried to use codeZ3checkassumptionscode with codef x  1code as the assumption to check with current context. But codeZ3checkassumptionscode doesnt allow such a compound formula. So, it can not be the solution.p  p3 I firstly push the context, add the assertion codef x  1code with codeZ3assertcnstrcode, test the consistency with codeZ3checkandgetmodelcode, and then pop the context just pushed. In the test, if its not consistent, I get current assignment with codeZ3getcontextassignmentctxcode and assert the negated assignment to trigger the backtrack. What I observe is that Z3 does find the inconsistency but the current assignment only contains assertions about the size part like code 1 f xcode. Or in other word, the assertions about the user theory like code x set1 and not  x set2code is missing. So even I negate the current assignment, after the backtracking, Z3 still tries the codex  set1code instead of the other option codex  set2code. p  pWhere I was wrong Thanksp

Negative 1925 pI very rarely close down Visual Studio intentionally.  The project Im working on is so ginormous that it takes about 15 minutes just to load it up, so its been my practice just to leave the solution open overnight so that itll be ready for me the next morning.  The only time I have to restart the program now is if it crashes  which  happens.  Every once in a while Ill do something it doesnt like and it quits on me.  I accept this.  Id love for it to be bulletproof, but I hardly expect that.p  pThe downside of this is that apparently, any settings you change in the program while its running fonts and colors, keyboard shortcuts, autoformatting settings, basically anything in the ToolsOptions dialogue are only saved when you quit the program legitimately.  These settings are strongnotstrong saved when it crashes.  So I find myself having to redo any settings changes I made every single time.p  pFirst off  why the heck doesnt it save the settings emwhen you change the settingsem  How hard would that be  Its a certain level of hubris to take it on faith that your program will always close normally and not bother saving state until the shutdown process.  And not having it save settings in an abnormal shutdown process either  Id get fired or at least reprimanded for writing code that did that, so how does Microsoft get away with it  And is there some way of forcing it to save settings without quitting and reloadingp

Ive also looked into CSS3 filters to accomplish the same thing, but again, support is horrible. So, would this be the only approach to fullscreen background image filters with modern browser compatibilitypli lipThe updateCanvas method is creating a new image object each time, Im thinking that this might be a bottleneck, but am unsure, and also unsure of how to get around itpli lipIve read others using a separate canvas as a buffer Would this actually increase performance in my situation pli lipIm really thinking theres a major logic issue in my code somewhere. It just doesnt make sense to me that I would need to loop through all of the pixel information more than once, but this is the only way Ive gotten it to work. Isnt there a way I can draw itapply the filter once, then on resize, just adjust the dimensions without having to redrawreloopreapply the filter I would think that it would maintain the filtered image, but if I remove the call to the canvasFilter method on window resize, it completely removes the filter effect. pli lipIve yet to use memoization techniques as Ive never quite understood it, and never quite understand wherewhen to use it. But, essentially, if I have a function that is returning the same results again and again such as the canvasFilter method can I memoize to increase performance  or would it be difference because its pulling different pixel information after the window has resizedpli lipIve also heard that a webGL render might help with this Might be way off as I dont know anything about webGL.pli ol  pSo sorry for the loooonng question, but hopefully this covers some topics that others can benefit from as well. Any suggestionstips would be much appreciated. Thanks p

Negative 1925 pI am trying to device an algorithm that performs error correction in names. My approach is having a database with the correct names, compute edit distance between each of them and the name entered and then suggest the 5 or 10 closest.p  pThis task is significantly different from standard error correction in words as some of the names might be replaced by initials. For instance Jonathan Smith and J. Smith are actually quite close and could easily be considered the same name, so the edit distance should be really small if not 0. Another challenge is that some names might be written differently while sounding the same. For instance codeShnaidercode and codeSchneidercode are versions of the same name written by people with different localesthere are better examples for that I guess. And another case  just imagine all the possible errors in writing codeJawaharlal Nehrucode most of which have nothing to do with the real name. Again probably most of them will be similar phonetically.p  pObviously Lucenes error correction algorithm will not help me here as it does not handle the above cases.p  pSo my question is do you know any library capable of doing error correction in names Can you propose some algorithm for handling the cases mentioned abovep  pI am interested in libraries in c or java. As for algorithm proposals any language or pseudo code will do.p

Theres another problem in that their initial states must be set to hidden beforehand and I dont want to do it in CSS that would hide everything from people whose browsers dont support javascript. Is anything of this sort possible or will I have to rely on creating slides in a loop my element ids go like w01, w02, ... If so, how would I put that block inside a loopp

I just want to call that stored proc to get data and not modify it.p  pThe problem is that the stored proc is returning multiple result set with exactly same fields. Just the data is bit different. So when that stored proc is being called in the front end it is being used to populate two diffrent data tables which is fine.p  pBut now I need to work with the combined results in excel and so dont have the advantages of multiple data tables. p  pBasically I want create a new stored proc which returns the union of the two results just by calling the existing storedproc.

Negative 1925 pAnkhSVN works fine while changing code in existing classes or adding new files to project. It updates project to newest version to all members. The problem is if user deletes a file from some directory locally because he thinks he doesnt need it and then he wants to have it after all, AnkhSVN will not add that file again. So, every time when user chooses to update project to latest version, AnkhSVN will ignore that file and will not add it to project again. The only way is to delete project and open it again directly from repository.p  pWhile working with TortoiseSVN it is normal when user deletes file locally and then if he chooses to update directory to latest version, TortoiseSVN will add that file again to local version. Why is that not a case with AnkhSVN and Visual Studio 2012 Can it be fixed somehow Thank you.p

I did change the name but everything worksp  pSo now I have turned to Stackoverflow to get help with my problem.

Negative 1925 pI made a flyout window in the notification area using WinAPI and my goal was to make it similar to the flyout windows that show up when you click some of the icons in the notification area, like the Volume icon.p  pI already succeeded in making it look and behave similar to the other ones, but there is one thing I cant seem to figure out. The link area of the flyout windows has a darker blueish background and there is a subtle difference in the look between Windows 7 and Windows 8. A picture of it in Windows 7 can be seen herep  pa hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopaa511448.aspxflyouts relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopaa511448.aspxflyoutsap  pI achieved this by painting this link area of my flyout window manually in the right colors including the gradient at the topmost part of the section using the codeWMPAINTcode message, but I just feel like its too much of a hack, especially because its not affected by changing themes in Windows. For example, if I set the Windows Classic theme this area should be grey and not blue.p  pSo, my question is, am I missing something in how this can be achieved without painting the window manually. I noticed that the details pane in Explorer windows in Win 7 has the same look. Ive searched quite a bit for answers but I havent found anything yet. This is my first time doing a GUI using the WinAPI so I have very little experience, and therefore Im assuming there is something that I just dont know about.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pI did manage to figure out how to draw this area without painting it manually. It can be drawn by using the codeOpenThemeDatacode and codeDrawThemeBackgroundcode functionsp  blockquote   pHTHEME aeroTheme  OpenThemeDatahWnd, LFLYOUTbr   DrawThemeBackgroundaeroTheme, hdc, FLYOUTLINKAREA, 0, amprect, amprectp blockquote  pThis obviously only works when themes are enabled, so for nonthemed cases I draw a normal rectangle with the appropriate color.p

Why EWS isnt storing a unique ID for appointments why and appointment.Id.UniqueIdis not constant p  pI didnt find a clear solution for this problem.p

Negative 1925 pSo what I am doing is creating a custom image picker, and I have a 320 X 320 AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer that I am using, and when I take a picture, I want to get a UIImage of what is actually seen in the preview layer, but what I get when I take a photo with codecaptureStillImageAsynchronouslyFromConnection completionHandlercode is a normal image with size 2448 X 3264. So what would be the best way to get make this image into a 320 x 320 square image like is seen in the preview layer without messing it up Is there a Right Way to do this Also, I am using codeAVLayerVideoGravityResizeAspectFillcode for the codevideoGravitycode property of codeAVCaptureVideoPreviewLayercode, if that is relevant. p
Negative 1925 pImagine Im developing a kind of system call which receives a codepidt pidcode and returns a file descriptor codefdcode. What this syscalls got to do is monitor the process whose pid is codepidcode so that, whenever this other process calls codeforkcode, something is written to the file descriptor codefdcode. To achieve this, I created a new list field in codestruct taskstructcode called, for example, codefilestosignalonforkcode. So, my syscall creates a new codestruct file filecode, gets the codestruct taskstruct taskcode related to codepidcode, add codefilecode to codetaskcodes codefilestosignalonforkcode list and returns the file descriptor representing codefilecode, so that I can use codepollcode to keep track of when the other process calls codeforkcode. I added a few lines of code to codedoforkcode, so that, when it gets called, it writes something to all the codestruct file code structures stored in the process codefilestosignalonforkcode list.p  pSo, is passing a process codestruct file code structure to another process a good idea Is there any way to check if the codestruct file codes owner is still alive before codedoforkcode try to write something to itp

Negative 1925 pMy idea was creating iOS applications where the user can enter a location. This location is stored in a remote database with the device id for push notifications. Then the application on the remote server periodically checks the weather and when its about to rain in one of the locations stored in the database it sends push notifications to all device ids for that location. p  pSo basically I need to create iOS applications to store data I like to call these listeners and a application for the server which connects to a weather api and sends notifications controller.p  pMy idea on the controller is still kind of vague and I dont really know how to achieve this.

Negative 1925 pIm starting to write a toy OS for the a hrefhttpbeagleboard.orgProductsBeagleBone20Black relnofollowBeagleBone Blacka, which uses an ARM CortexA8based a hrefhttpwww.ti.comproductam3359 relnofollowTI Sitara AM3359 SoCa and the UBoot bootloader. Ive got a simple standalone hello world app writing to UART0 that I can load through UBoot so far, and now Im trying to move on to interrupt handlers, but I cant get SWI to do anything but hang the device.p  pAccording to the AM335x TRM starting on page 4099, if youre interested, the interrupt vector table is mapped in ROM at 0x20000. The ROM SWI handler branches to RAM at 0x4030ce08, which branches to the address stored at 0x4030ce28. Initially, this is a unique dead loop at 0x20084.p  pMy code sets up all the ARM processor modes SP to their own areas at the top of RAM, and enables interrupts in the CPSR, then executes an SWI instruction, which always hangs. Perhaps jumping to some deadloop instruction Ive looked at a bunch of samples, and read whatever documentation I could find, and I dont see what Im missing.p  pCurrently my only interaction with the board is over serial connection on UART0 with my linux box. UBoot initializes UART0, and allows loading of the binary over the serial connection.p  pHeres the relevant assemblyp  precode.arm .section .text.boot  .equ usrmode,          0x10 .equ fiqmode,          0x11 .equ irqmode,          0x12 .equ svcmode,          0x13 .equ abtmode,          0x17 .equ undmode,          0x1b .equ sysmode,          0x1f  .equ swivector,        0x4030ce28  .equ romswibaddr,    0x20008 .equ romswiaddr,      0x20028 .equ ramswibaddr,    0x4030CE08 .equ ramswiaddr,      0x4030CE28  .macro setupmode mode, stackpointer     mrs r0, cpsr     mov r1, r0     and r1, r1, 0x1f     bic r0, r0, 0x1f     orr r0, r0, mode     msr cpsrcsfx, r0     ldr sp, stackpointer     bic r0, r0, 0x1f     orr r0, r0, r1     msr cpsrcsfx, r0 .endm  .macro disableinterrupts     mrs r0, cpsr     orr r0, r0, 0x80     msr cpsrc, r0 .endm  .macro enableinterrupts     mrs r0, cpsr     bic r0, r0, 0x80     msr cpsrc, r0 .endm  .global start start      Initial SP     ldr r3, CSTACKTOP     mov sp, r3       Set up all the modes stacks     setupmode fiqmode, FIQSTACKTOP     setupmode irqmode, IRQSTACKTOP     setupmode svcmode, SVCSTACKTOP     setupmode abtmode, ABTSTACKTOP     setupmode undmode, UNDSTACKTOP     setupmode sysmode, CSTACKTOP       Clear out BSS     ldr r0, bssstart     ldr r1, bssend     mov r5, 0     mov r6, 0     mov r7, 0     mov r8, 0      b clearbsscheck  clearbss     stmia r0, r5r8  clearbsscheck     cmp r0, r1     blo clearbss       Load our SWI handlers address into      the vector table     ldr r0, swihandler     ldr r1, swivector     str r0, [r1]       Debugprint out these SWI addresses     ldr r0, romswibaddr     bl printmem      ldr r0, romswiaddr     bl printmem      ldr r0, ramswibaddr     bl printmem      ldr r0, ramswiaddr     bl printmem      enableinterrupts  swicall     swi 0xCC     bl kernelmain     b reset   .global swihandler swihandler      Get the SWI parameter into r0     ldr r0, [lr, 4]     bic r0, r0, 0xff000000       Save lr onto the stack     stmfd sp, lr     bl printuint32     ldmfd sp, pc codepre  pThose debugging prints produce the expected valuesp  precode00020008 e59ff018 00020028 4030ce08 4030ce08 e59ff018 4030ce28 80200164 codepre  pAccording to objdump, 0x80200164 is indeed swihandler. 0xe59ff018 is the instruction ldr pc, [pc, 0x20].p  pWhat am I missing It emseemsem like this should work.p

It is not so important right now how that order is build a codeSeq[TransferObject[]code, or one transfer object referencing the next or however. li ol  pstrongThere will be different implementations of the codeServicecode trait. For each codeServicecode instance it must be specified which types this instance can handle.strongp  pExample This Service codeval myService  MyServicecode can handle codeTransferObjects[MyTypeA]code and codeTransferObjects[MyTypeB]code etc.. When an API user tries to pass a codeTransferObjects[MyUnknownType]code the compiler should throw an error.p  pI read about Scalas type system, about type classes e.g. with implicits and type declarations, but I dont understand all details, yet.p  pI tried to use an implementation of the codeServicecode trait with type specific handlers as type classes. codeMyHandler[MyTypeA]code, codeMyHandler[MyTypeB]code etc. and using implicits to pass in the correct handler for the current parameter type. But strongthe handlers should not be exposed to the API userstrong. That is why I wonder if it is possible at all, to throw compiler errors if the user passes in parameters of types that the codeServicecode cant handle.p  pThe real implementation is more complicated and currently broken. Maybe I can deliver some more code later.p  hr  pstrongRoundupstrongp  pSo again I want multiple Service instances. Each of them should be able to handle multiple parameter types. If a parameter of an unknown type is passed in, the compiler should throw an error. Type specific handlers are considered as implementation details and should remain hidden from API users.p  pHow do I realize thatp

Negative 1925 pIm extending an existing Matlab program with additional functionality. The original program uses a structure to represent a steady state point in a phase space, and this structure has 4 fields, like thisp  precodeoldstylepoint      kind stst     parameter [0.7846 1]     x 2.0010     stability [1x1 struct] codepre  pIn my extension, I would like the structure to have 5 fields i.e. one extra field. For most points, the field would just be empty, but for some special bifurcation points, it would contain some text naming the kind of bifurcation occurring. So it would look likep  precodenewstylepoint      kind stst     parameter [0.7846 1]     x 2.0010     stability [1x1 struct]     flag hopf codepre  pBut now we run into a problem. Points like these are stored in arrays branches, and most branches are built iteratively. So the existing programs has several subroutines doing things likep  precodenewbranch  [oldbranch, newpoint] newbranch1  pointzero newbranchN1  newpoint codepre  pNow if the branch consists of old style points with 4 fields and I want to add a new style point with 5 fields, Matlab gives a concatenation error.p  pSo now my question is there any way to tell Matlab that it should automatically create the missing fields when concatenating Or is there another way to solve this problem in an elegant fashionp  pOf course, I could edit all existing subroutines to make sure all points they handle get the new field set to  if they dont have it already. But I would prefer changing as little existing code as possible. The other way around, ensuring all ingoing points passed to existing routines as arguments are new style would be difficult as well.p

Negative 1925 pFor example in my program I called a function foo. The compiler and assembler would eventually write codejmp someaddrcode in the binary. I know the concept of virtual memory. The program would think that it has the whole memory at disposal, and the start position is code0x000code. In this way the assembler can calculate the position of foo.p  pBut in fact this is not decided until runtime right I have to run the program to know where I loaded the program into, hence the address of the codejmpcode.

Negative 1925 pWe are using the embedded activemq broker within Fuse ESB 7.1.0 with consumers colocated .p  pThe producer client is deployed on a remote GlassFish server. It uses activeMQ resource adapter 5.6.0 along with spring jms template. The client publish messages to different queues. I want some of the messages going to a given queue to use jms.useAsyncSendtrue where as the other messages should use the default. I see below optionsp  p1 I cant append the the option jms.useAsyncSendtrue in the resource adapter URL because that will enforce it for all messages.p  p2 The JNDI lookup for the connection factory is returning an instance of org.apache.activemq.ra.ActiveMQConnectionFactory. I was actually expecting an instance of org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQConnectionFactory, which would have allowed me to use setUseAsyncSend for the corresponding jmsTemplate. So I cant use this option as well.p  p3 I have multiple connection factories configured under the GlassFish connectors one for each queue. I am trying to pass the property jms.useAsyncSendtrue as an additional property to a particular connection factory. I am expecting this to be used only for the connections created in that particular connection pool. Now, having done this I want to verify if it really worked.p  pQuestion 1 Is there a way where I can check in the consumer side if the property useAsyncSend was set in an inbound message This is to verify what I have done at producer side has actually worked. Note that I am using camelcontext to route messages to the end consumers. Is there a way to check this within the camecontext is there a header or any such thing corresponding to thisp  pQuestion 2 Is there a better way to set useAsyncSend in the producer side where one resource adapter is used for sending messages to different queues with different values for useAsyncSend.p  pI understand that useAsyncSend is an activeMQ specific configuration hence not available in jmstemplate interfacep  pAppreciate any help on this.p  pthanksp

Negative 1925 pIve a delicate problem regarding the fact that I have a working solution with AutoFac, CommonServiceLocator and Udis Domain events a hrefhttpwww.udidahan.com20090614domaineventssalvation relnofollowhttpwww.udidahan.com20090614domaineventssalvationa.  I let Autofac set the ServiceProvider in MVC bootstrapper. But two things are annoying me 1 The domain events are raised through static method which uses CommonServiceLocator. This makes it hard to unit test and it also hides away some Autofac features I like to use. This leads me to ... 2 My events are consumed by IEventSubsriber where T is a DomainEvent. But the scenario is that I like to have several subscribers on one event. That means I get several Subscriber when I raise an Event. p  precode IEnumerableltIEventSubscriberltTgtgt registeredHandlers                      ServiceLocator.Current.GetAllInstancesltIEventSubscriberltTgtgt codepre  pBut I have tagged this Subscriber Instances with MetaData through AutoFacp  precode   builder.RegisterTypeltCreateNewRevisionEventgt.AsImplementedInterfaces                    .WithMetadataltEventSubsriberMetadatagtx gt x.Fororder gt order.Order, 1 codepre  pand the MetaData Class isp  precodepublic class EventSubsriberMetadata              public int Order  get set       codepre  pSo the question.

I know that I have a dependency to CommonServiceLocator today. But use DI on an Base Entity class that what it result in I do not know any easy way. Ive seen Nicklas Blumhardts demo where AutoFac injects an DomainEventDispatcher into entities through NHibernate Interceptors and there for can dispatch Events during UpDown to persistence. Neat Solution.  But I use Entity Framework 5 and also I hope for a easier solution.p  pLooking forward to see some answer or at least discuss this topic. I think a lot of people halts when they approach this problem. And maybe just  Ok we use CSL just for Events and they make boundaries for Unit testing as well.  We skip unit testing for events.  That not an issue here p  pBest Regards Magnusp

Negative 1925 pIve got a chat bot setup to receive chat messages using a standard instant messaging protocal. As it is now, the chat bot responds to a client each time a message is sent. This means that it responds to each line sent. Instead of doing this, Id like to store 5 messages at a time from a client and respond on a time based interval instead of on a per message based interval. Heres an example of per message based intervalp  precodeHuman Hey there Bot Hello Human What is your favorite color Bot Green Human Do you like animals Bot I like your mother. Human HEY gt codepre  pWhat Id like to do is store 5 lines at a time for each user talking to the bot. Since each user has a unique userID, I can store the messages in a onetomany relationship. It would look something like thisp  precodeUserIDMessage1, Message2, Message3, Message4, Message5 codepre  pSo the above example would be stored asp  precodeHuman Hey there, What is your favorite color,Do you like animals,HEY gt, Message5 codepre  pId like the list to be limited, though, and replace the first entry when a new entry appears and the list is full. Basically, it is always keeping the most recent 5 chat messages in this list.p  pIm not sure what type of object or function I should use to create this type of associative array. I need to be able to check to see if a user is already added, and expand or collapse the list if a user stops talking to the bot we dont want an infinite list  we should garbage collect lists which havent been used in a whilep  pHow can I efficiently set this up so that I dont run into resource problems, memory leaks, etc p

Negative 1925 pI have a JSP page which I need to style with JQM. The catch is all the html elements are generated by a JSP tag library EMC Documentum wdk  framework . The problem is I cannot add JQM attributes to these JSP tags to style them as they throw an exception stating that JQM attributes are invalid attributes this is how normally JSP tags work. JQM automatically applies default styling to these generated html elements. But what I want is to change some of these JQM styling and add what I want. For example there are three buttons generated on my page. After JQM applies its default styling to these buttons they appear as block level elements and they occupy the entire width of the page. I want to change them to be inline buttons so that they appear in one row and their width becomes the width of their content.

I also cant use attachments with an codeLMSGcode.p  pIm sorry if this is the wrong place for this kind of post  I find it very difficult to find the emrightem place.p

Negative 1925 pIn a great many places in the software I write, there are threedimensioned arrays of codeshortcode or codefloatcode, usually with several million elements. The data is best understood conceptually as a threedimensioned array, since it describes values at regular locations in space. p  pI saw a mention elsewhere here that the .NET CLR is not terribly performant when it comes to traversing those arrays, for example, when computing new values and populating a second, equally sized and dimensioned array. If this is true, why is that so p  pFor reasons of readability Ive not settled on the idea of using jagged arrays, yet, but if thats really the answer then Im willing, butp  pTo get around this its been proposed to me that I format the data as a single dimensioned array. For example, if my array has dimensions with magnitudes codemcode, codencode, and codeocode, then I would create a codefloat[mno]code instead of a codefloat[m,n,o]code, and write my own indexer to get to the correct array locations during traversal.p  pThe specific use case is in parallelizing the traversal, such asp  precodeParallel.For0,mx gt fory0,yltn,y  forz0,zlto,z doSomethingarrayx,y,z  codepre  pWhere in the singleindexed case there would be a codeParallel.ForEachmyArray, position gt doSomethingarrayPositioncode kind of thing going on instead of the nested codeforcode loops. p  pSo, the question is, really, would that be any faster than relying on the CLR array indexing thats built in p  pstrongEDIT Ive supplied my own answer below, based on some timing tests.

Negative 1925 pIn standard 12.8[class.copy], clause 31p  blockquote   pWhen certain criteria are met, an implementation is allowed to omit   the copymove construction of a class object, even if the copymove   constructor andor destructor for the object have side effects.

Negative 1925 pIm using magento C.E 1.7. I use all shipping methods of magento and Im viewing only one shipping method in the front end, which has higher priority. Im using table rate shipping for some countries.p  pI wanted to add strongspecial fixed shipping pricestrong for some products when they shipped to that countries only. So that, I added new shipping method namely strongflat rate per productstrong, by using a new module. p  pBased on this module, a text box is added to all the products in admin to specify the special shipping price. If I filled this field with some value, It considers it as a special shipping price. And if not filled it, it will be considered as special shipping price is 0. p  pSo I have given least priority in the sort order for this shipping method to avoid this method from viewing on front end when products without special shipping price and products with special shipping price both are added into the cart.p  pSo that, If only the special shipping priced product is added to the cart, It shows only table rate shipping method  in front end.p  pI checked the code in availble.phtml. There is a foreach loop to proceed with available shipping methods. I need to check the availability of the strongflat rate per productstrong and its price value for the product before start of loop execution.p  pI tried to get all the values of the array. But I could not. Can anyone help on thisp

Negative 1925 pI want to understand more about what I found about all points in a polygon intersecting a bitmap in Android. Say I have a bitmap and I use the getPixels function to retrieve all of my pixel values in that bitmap. Then I draw a polygon of any shape such that part of it intersects with the bitmap. At any partp  pI want then is all of the pixel values of the intersect of the bitmap and the polygon. Here is an example image of what I am talking about img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comyc9ZM.jpg altenter image description herep  pThe shaded part is the intersection of pixels of the bitmap larger rectangle and the closed area of the polygonsmaller rectangle that I wantp  pFrom the post about Point in Polygon describes using ray casting, a straight lineray horizontally across the shape, we find how many times the ray intersects the polygons vertices. I think my solution is an extension of this concept but I am stuck about my approach.  p  pI thought of having multiple rays and somehow grab the number of times that the pixels of the polygon and the pixels of the bitmap intersect but I believe this approach is not practical. p  pCan someone help with this issuep  pPlease do not write up a solution as I want to write one on my own although example code and how it works are appreicated as I am a beginner in Android.p
Negative 1925 pSo Ive got a C client application that contains a List of object models each of which represents a row in an MS SQL Server database table.p  pThese contain a DateTime member called RowDate.p  pThe database table also contains a datetime2 column called RowDate.p  pRowDate is basically the date and time that the row was last updated or inserted in the database.p  pI need a query to select rows that are out of date  i.e. RowDate on the server  RowDate in the client application FOR THAT PARTICULAR ROWOBJECT. Obviously its not as simple as just putting codeWHERE RowDate gt [whatever]code in the query as there will be many dates to compare to and they all need to be compared on a rowbyrow basis.p  pThe point being to make sure the cached data in the C application is brought up to date while minimising the traffic to and from the database.p  pI have a few ideas how to achieve this, but they all seem very ugly, slow, inefficient, or a pain in the ass so Im throwing this question out here in the hope that someone can point me in the right direction.p  pI emCOULDem always concatenate some lengthy codeWHEREcode clause, but that seems a bit clunky  there could be thousands of objects in the C application, so that ends up being a very lengthy SQL query...surely theres a better way Maybe creating some sort of temporary table in memory with some sort of intersection between that and the main table in the DB My inexperience with SQL is showing here.p  pIve spent a while on google trying to look this up but Im struggling to distill my question down into search terms...p  pThanks in advance.p

This is what I am trying to dop  ol liThe basic form is some predefined long text,li liAt some predefined places in the text, insert form widgets, like a combo box or a date picker.li liThe whole structure should be presented to the user as continuous text with the options to select on the combobox, date, etc.li liThe text should wrap around the end of lines of the containing element a paragraph containerli liThe form inputs combobox, etc should flow next to the end of the preceding text in the same line.li ol  pI would post an image for clarification but unfortunately I do not have enough reputationp  pThe problem I am experiencing with smartgwt forms is that they are presented to the user within a table structure using rows and columns that doesnt fit the concept of continuous text. My text is wrapped around the containing cell of the table and the flow of the form is lost.p  pIf I set the text to no wrap with .setWrapfalse, then the text doesnt wrap in the containing cell, but it doesnt wrap either at the end of the line for the paragraph stracture. It is difficult to use colspan and rowspan because the size of the text varies for different templates.p  pAny ideas on how to implement this Any help appreciated.p  pMany thanks in advance,p

Negative 1925 pFirst of all, I have looked at loads of related questions, both on SO and in other places  but none is addressing my issue unfortunately.p  pI have a dynamically built DOM substree about 10levels deep and a complex javascript code that shows or hides pieces of that subtree or the entire subtree.  Theres another code that can change text of various codedivcode elements somewhere inside that subtree somewhere means anywhere from level 1 to level 10.  Further, individual nodes inside the subtree can also be shown or hidden.p  pTo make a long story short, whenever the text is changed, I need to figure out the new height of the corresponding div.  Unfortunately, when the text changes, the actual div is visible within the context of its parent and usually its parents parent  but not within the context of the whole subtree  hence the height is returned as 0.p  pPretty much all solutions center around making the div visible, measuring its height, then hiding it again.  To adopt this solution to my issue, I would have to take the div in question, then traverse the dom tree upward from it, check whether the corresponding parents are hidden or not, change their visibility, continue upward until I got everything shown, then measure the height of my div, then revert the visibility of the elements that I changed.p  pApart from being a nightmare to implement, it sounds EXTREMELY slow.  So, is there any solution for getting the height of a div, that in itself is visible within its parent, but has several of its not direct parents hidden  Im happy with either jQuery or a plain javascript solution.p

Negative 1925 pFor a few weeks Ive been thinking about relation between objects  not especially OOPs objects. For instance in strongCstrong, were used to representing that by layering pointers or container of pointers in the structure that needs an access to the other object. If an object codeAcode needs to have an access to codeBcode, its not uncommon to find a codeB pBcode in codeAcode.p  pBut Im not a strongCstrong programmer anymore, I write programs using functional languages, and more especially in strongHaskellstrong, which is a pure functional language. Its possible to use pointers, references or that kind of stuff, but I feel strange with that, like doing it the nonHaskell way.p  pThen I thought a bit deeper about all that relation stuff and came to the pointp  blockquote   pemWhy do we even represent such relation by layeringemp blockquote  pI read some folks already thought about that a hrefhttpshackage.haskell.orgpackagedatareify relnofollowherea. In my point of view, representing relations through explicit graphes is way better since it enables us to focus on the emcoreem of our type, and express relations later are through combinators a bit like SQL does.p  pBy emcoreem I mean that when we define codeAcode, we expect to define what codeAcode is emmade ofem, not what it emdepends onem. For instance, in a video game, if we have a type codeCharactercode, its legit to talk about codeTraitcode, codeSkillcode or that kind of stuff, but is it if we talk about codeWeaponcode or codeItemscode Im not so sure anymore. Thenp  precodedata Character       chSkills  [Skill]   , chTraits  [Traits]   , chName    String   , chWeapon  IORef Weapon  or STRef, or whatever   , chItems   IORef [Item]  ditto    codepre  psounds really wrong in term of design to me. Id rather prefer something likep  precodedata Character       chSkills  [Skill]   , chTraits  [Traits]   , chName    String      link our character to a Weapon using a Graph Character Weapon  link our character to Items using a Graph Character [Item] or that kind of stuff codepre  pFurthermore, when a day comes to add new features, we can just create new types, new graphs and link. In the first design, wed have to break the codeCharactercode type, or use some kind of work around to extend it.p  pWhat do you think about that idea What do you think is best to deal with that kind of issues in strongHaskellstrong, a pure functional languagep

Negative 1925 pWas reading up on the OpenClosed principle of SOLID design and was curious about its maintainability.p  pLets say I have child class B and C which inherit from parent class A. B has methods unique to B, C has methods unique to C. Parent class A has two common methods that are utilized by the child classes.p  pIn a future code release, lets say we have a new feature that introduces a common method between classes B and C. We now cannot push that method up to class A because itd violate the Closed for modification portion of the principle. This seems to introduce code redundancy. Not only that, but technically wouldnt adding this new feature to classes B and C be also violate the modification tenet of the principlep  pIt seems with the OpenClosed approach you end up building an unnecessary, cascading hierarchy of child classes simply because one is not allowed to make alterations to the original code. Is this a correct assumptionunderstandingp

Upgrading to .NET 4.0 or .NET 4.5 is not an option today.p  pIve tried two other possible ways of skipping the LinkLabel that do not work.p  ol lipPut the LinkLabel on a panel and set the TabStop property on the panel to false.  The LinkLabel still gets tabbed to.pli lipProcess the Enter event on the LinkLabel and use SendKeys or some such nonsense to continue to the next control.  This doesnt work because it makes the Click event stop firing.pli ol  pI also considered setting the TabIndex for all LinkLabels on the form to a much higher value than the rest of the controls.  However, that would not work eitherp  pEach field is a TextBox or ComboBox on a panel with a Label.  The ComboBox fields have an additional control on the Panel with them a LinkLabel that says Edit Items.  Each of these Panels are on the main FlowLayoutPanel.  p  pCorrect me if Im wrong.  The way I understand tab order of controls on nested panels is that each Panel would have its own Tab Order.  Then the tab order of each is combined in series based on the TabIndex of each Panel to determine the effective tab order of the controls on the form.  Right  So setting the TabIndex of each LinkLabel to a number in the high 200s would not fix the original problem, the way I see it.p  pHas anyone seen this challenge before  How did you solve it  I feel like I may have to do something drastic like subclass the LinkLabel control.  What would you dop

Negative 1925 pI have a solution with several projects in it, one of them being a website. The website has references to five web services, which are being run on our own servers. When building the website with VS 2010 I get the following errorp  blockquote   pValidating Web Site   AppWebReferencesVpService1 Build web Reference.svcmap Could not load file or assembly Konzeptum.BL.Base, Version2.6.0.0, Cultureneutral, PublicKeyTokennull or one of its dependencies.  The system cannot find the file specified.p blockquote  pThe service that produces this error changes on every build. The apparently missing dll cannot be found on any of the machines I looked at, its not even present on the servers running the services. The services however have references to some APIs which in turn have references to the dlls emKonzeptum.BL.Telerate.Provisioning, Konzeptum.VO.Base, Konzeptum.VO.Telerate.Provisioningem. My emguessem is that these dlls make use of the missing emKonzeptum.BL.Baseem.p  pI can compile each project just fine the services, APIs etc. just the website has this problem. I have tried updating the service references, deleting and readding them, nothing. The only solution I could find online and that kind of works is deactivating the reuse of types in the emService Reference Settingsem for each service. I uncheck the three dlls mentioned above and reuse all other types.p  pNow however if I build the website I get errors that there are ambiguous references between types provided by the service and existing ones e.g. FileInfo from System.IO or errors that some data types cannot be found. These missing types however have nothing to do with emKonzeptumem stuff, they are defined by the services themselves. Luckily for me these errors pop up very late in the build process of the website, so that most of it is usable.p  pWhat could be the cause of these problems and how can I solve them Thank you for any help.p  pstrongEditstrong Maybe it wasnt clear before, but this problem seems to occur only on my machine, two other developers dont have any problems building the website and were using the same tfs repository. The servers running the live system dont have any problems. But the missing dll is not present anywhere, so I cant just copy it over. The Assembly Binding Log Viewer isnt of much help either, in the entry for emKonzeptum.BL.Baseem under Calling assembly it just says Unknown.p

Negative 1925 pfunction readandsend is not getting called, no error message. Basically what I am trying to do is that I want to communicate between concurrent server and client programs. Client will request for a file , server will check if the file is available, then it will check if the file size lt 1000 bytes, then just send the file to user, but if file size  1000 bytes then server will compress it and transfer to the client.p  pWhat I have done is that client enters the file name and, server passes the filename and communicationsocket to a function which is causing problem. That function finds the length of the file and execute accordingly.  p  pI am using ubuntu 13.10. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Negative 1925 pIn a Silverlight 4.0 with Prism application I am maintaining, a page has a Search button which makes WCF service call asynchronously to fetch some data from database, based on the search criteria entered by the user. During the search operation i.e. from the time Search button is clicked till the time search results are displayed on page, a progress bar window Silverlight child window is shown on top of the page I know it blocks the user for the duration, but this is how all the pages of the application were designed and I cannot change it. Sometimes the Search operation takes long time several minutes to return and show the data, and sometimes it shows the results really fast, depending on the search criteria. Now the users want the flexibility to be able to cancel any  Search operation if they feel it is taking too much time to show the results.p  pTo address this requirement, I tried the followingp  p1 Added a Cancel Search button on the Progressbar window.br 2 Added a public static boolean variable Cancel Search flag, with default value false in the Progress bars ViewModel. br 3 In the Cancel Search buttons click command handler in the same viewmodel, set the Cancel Search flag to true and then closed the Progress bar window.br 4 In the asynchronous WCF Serach Services callback method, first checked if the Progress bars Cancel Search flag is true. If yes, ignore the results dont do anything. Otherwise, bound the returned result to the UI as usual.p  pHowever, when testing the Cancel Search button, I found that the WCF callback method is getting called before the Cancel buttons click command handler, hence the search results are getting displayed even when Cancel Search button is clicked. Obviously this will happen for short running WCF calls which gets executed and completed before the user can click the Cancel button. For long running WCF calls which gets several minutes to get the results, the above solution may work fine. But while hitting the search button, I do not have any way to know if it is going to be a shortrunning async call or long running, do I So is it at all possible to fulfill the requirement in this way or using some other way Making synchronous WCF call  perhaps but again I gathered its a big nono for Silverlightp

Negative 1925 pEDIT So ultimately what I ended up doing here is running it straight in a mysql.expect script. Any variables that need to be updated would be replaced via sed in standard bash script used to launch mysql.expect. p  pI have a bash script that runs expect, and automates the MySQL installation process, as you can see a hrefhttppastebin.commtA7Ncxb relnofollowherea. The reason expect needs to be called in this script is to source local bash variables, so I cant just run it via expect, but rather it needs to be called it as followsp  precodeif [ catch spawn binbash .mysql.sh error ]      puts Could not spawn mysql.sh error   codepre  pI know this works, because theres another script I have called test.sh that does the followingp  precodebinbash source .myvars.rc  echo CONNECTED gtgt .out.html  echo MYVARIABLE gtgt .out.html codepre  pThis works fine, the variable is correctly added to out.html. The mysql.sh script works when called directly, but not through expect, and there are no errors. Any ideas Thanks. p

Negative 1925 pIve a project to store and process expenses of a user. There will be only two operations on the database strongINSERTstrong and strongSELECTstrong.

I need a comparison based on speed while querying a large amount of data.p  pstrong2strong Since per day it may contain millions of records, Millions of rows resulted by query need to be transferred from the server to client. In my case there is one more overhead. As the database server is remote to Web server. So the result need to be transferred from database server to web server and then to client. How to make it fasterp  pstrong4strong If i choose MySQL, which will be better strongastrong Dumping the whole data in one big SQL table. strongbstrong Creating a table for each day with date as the table name which will contain smaller amounts of data. I thought b will be faster while giving a date range since I know which table to select instead of looking in a big table and querying for the specific date.p  pstrong3strong For now Im trying with MySQL. The test data is already there. I am using a python script to parse that data and dump it in MySQL. I can edit the script and make it work for any type of database. I tried the query strong4strong mentioned above. With the result from the database server, my webserverclient since Im testing, my web server is the client now. kind of hanged while around 13 million of rows as the result of the query are being transferred from the database server. So I used a loop in my PHP code to limit the query 1000 rows at a time like the sample belowp  precodeLoop until getting data from database     i0     SELECT  FROM ltTablegt LIMIT i, 1000     i1000  codepre  pIts still slow, but now the system is not hanging during the transfer. But does codeLIMITcode here will work like, get 1st 1000 records while codei0code, Then the 2nd 1000 records while codei1000code and so on. Or Itll get 1st 1000 records while codei0code, Then start from 0 again but skip the 1st 1000 records and get the 2nd 1000 records while codei1000codeand so on which will be much slower obviously.

Negative 1925 pI have a slight problem bit of the back story. recently ive been trying to test out univention which is a linux distribution with the goal of being able to replace Microsoft active directory.p  pI tested it locally and all went reasonably well after a few minor issues i then decided to test it remotely as the company wants to allow remote users to access this so i used myhyve.com to host it and its now been setup successfully and works reasonably well.p  phowever my main problem is DNS based as when trying to connect to the domain the only way windows will recognize it is by editing the network adapter and setting ip v4 dns server address to the ip address of the server hosting the univention active directory replacement. although this does allow every thing to work its not ideal and dns look up on the internet are considerably longer. i was wondering if any one had any ideas or have done something similar and encountered this problems before and know a work around. i want to avoid setting up a vpn if possible.p  pafter initially registering the computer on the domain i am able to remove the dns server address and just use a couple of amendments to the HOST file to keep it running but this still leads to having issues connecting to the domain controller sometimes and is not ideal. any ideas and suggestions would be greatly received.p  p.Michael p

Negative 1925 pI have a django web app on strongA2hostingstrong, where I am using strong.htaccessstrong files and strongpassengerwsgi.pystrong. It was working fine the last time I touched it, but then someone who had a look at it later informed me that it was broken.p  pI created a test situation to find the problem and heres the gist of it.p  pWhen I do a strongGETstrong to codewww.geo4ce.comquiztestweirdcode, it goes to a page with a simple form that just has one input and a submit and an action that has codequiztestweirdcode and codemethodpostcode.  When I submit the form, the server expects the quiz part of the url to be referring to a path on the file server, cant find it and then logs an error that it cant find it.  But, then it checks the testweird part of the url against my django strongurls.pystrong file, finds a different view for that and displays it.p  pA scenario that almost works properly is with codewww.geo4ce.comquiztesthackedcode, that has the same set up, except the form has action  codeanythingherequiztesthackedcode.  In this case, the anythinghere part of the url gets an error logged, since it doesnt exist on the file server, and then the codequiztesthackedcode part of the url works normally to get back to the original web page.p  pAnyone have any idea how I might be able to fix or debug thisp  pstrong[EDIT]strong I dont think its the .htaccess file thats the cause.  It looks something like this.p  precodePassengerEnabled On PassengerAppRoot pathtoappfolder   Prevent Apache from serving .htaccess files ltFilesMatch .htaccessgt     Order allow,deny     Deny from all ltFilesMatchgt   deny from xxx.yyy.zzz codepre

Negative 1925 pLets say I want to calculate the sum of code2ncode for codencode ranging from 0 to 100. I could write the followingp  precodeseq  0 .. 100  gt Seq.sumBy  2I codepre  pHowever, this does not behave like codecode or other operatorsfunctions. The problem is the fact that F uses codecode and codecode to delimit comments and my usage of the exponentiation operator is identified as such. I know I could instead sayp  precodeSeq.sumBy fun n gt 2I  n codepre  por evenp  precodeSeq.sumBy   2I codepre  pbut the former is a little more verbose than necessary and the extra whitespace in the latter is a huge eyesore for me.p  pIs there a standard way to handle the aforementioned usage of codecode Perhaps some kind of escapingp
Negative 1925 pIm typically used to traditional table in codeSQLcode where I have multiple codecolumnscode with rows populated. I execute a stored procedure and store all the data in codeDataTablecode and loop through the table to get the results I need. For example,p  precode public static DataTable getInfo string sessionID              try                      SqlConnection conn  new SqlConnectionSystem.Configuration.ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings[SandBox].ConnectionString             SqlCommand cmd  new SqlCommandGetSessionInfo, conn             cmd.Parameters.AddWithValueSessionGUID, sessionID             cmd.CommandType  CommandType.StoredProcedure             DataTable dt  new DataTable             SqlDataAdapter da  new SqlDataAdaptercmd             da.Filldt             return dt                  catch Exception                       throw               codepre  pI would load the DataTablep  precode DataTable infoTbl  new DataTable  infoTbl  getInfolbldatabasesessionID.Text codepre  pAnd I would use codeforeachcode loop to loop through the DataTable.p  precodeforeach DataRow row in infoTbl.Rows     string x  col.ToString  codepre  pThe issue I run into is the database guy gave me a stored procedure that returns a different output emdifferent from what Im used toem.

Negative 1925 pThe issue Im having is my code is creating duplicate data in the database. I believe the following is what is occurring even though it ought to be impossiblep  pWe have a page which has a long running task which is kicked off by an UpdatePanel in this case, triggered by a timer. This task grabs data from a web service, deletes the local copy actually just sets an IsDeleted flag, not a sql DELETE, and creates a new object and commits it to the DB.p  pI believe that core cause of the duplication is that the user is closingreloading the tab before the AJAX request returns and is starting the process anew. As the first AJAX request is still processing, the second one starts. The logs back this up.p  pHowever, I know this should be impossible The page in question reads and writes to Session, and EnableSessionState is not set to ReadOnly or Disabled. The requests should have been queued and not interleaved. However the logs clearly show the followingp  pThread 1 gets halfway done with processing deletes half the data and creates new objects then the web service starts to lag.p  pThread 2 kicks off, grabbing data which has been half updated by thread 1. This half updates fine because it is just like a regular data refresh thus far from Thread 2s perspective the same as if we had queued the requestsp  pThread 1 finishes, deleting the last half of the data, creating new objects.p  pThread 2 finishes, deleting the last half of the data the same as thread 1 has just done, but the ORM we are using wont complain and creates new objects which are duplicates of the objects thread 1 just created.p  pI know about half a dozen ways to fix the problem that isnt my question. My question is Is there anything special about long running minutes long processes in ASP.NET which would allow the processes to interleave How about AJAX requestsp  pThe only thing I can think of is that we do something in a DLL like the followingp  precodeDateTime now  DateTime.Now DateTime until  now.AddMinutes3 whileuntil gt now     var result  makeWebServiceRequest     ifresult.error  0          process data          Try again in 10 seconds     System.Thread.Threading.Sleep10000  codepre  pIs it possible that while a thread is sleeping, it doesnt count towards the session queue, especially since its in an external assemblyp

Negative 1925 pIm using the selectColorFormat method from bigflake to get supported input color format of encoder of MediaCodec.It works well on some tested devices except Huawei Mate7. The returned color format is COLORFormatYUV420Planar.So I configure it as the input format.But when encoding I found the input buffers capacity is not correct,which should be 3widthheight2.But its smaller than that.So when queueInputBuffer called error occured. Then I observed the capabilities.colorFormats list, it has more than ten color formats.But on the normal devices the list has about 2 or 3 color formats.Then I chose the color format to COLORFormatYUV420SemiPlanar and it works well on Mate7 too.p  pSo I doubt whether this is a bug of Mate7 version or the bug of selectColorFormat methodp  pAnd I find the anwser of FAQ Q5 has p  precode20 COLORFormatYUV420PackedPlanar also I420 39 COLORFormatYUV420PackedSemiPlanar also NV12 0x7f000100 COLORTIFormatYUV420PackedSemiPlanar also also NV12  codepre  pWhats the meaning of also I420 and also NV12Does it mean the layout is all the same with I420 or NV12Because I have tested I420 and NV12, but havent come across these three colors device.p  pThe selectColorFormat method is as belowsp  precodeprivate MediaCodecInfo selectCodecString mimeType      int numCodecs  MediaCodecList.getCodecCount     for int i  0 i lt numCodecs i          MediaCodecInfo codecInfo  MediaCodecList.getCodecInfoAti         if codecInfo.isEncoder              continue                  String[] types  codecInfo.getSupportedTypes         for int j  0 j lt types.length j              if types[j].equalsIgnoreCasemimeType                  return codecInfo                                return null   private int selectColorFormatString mimeType      MediaCodecInfo codecInfo  selectCodecmimeType     int colorFormat  0     MediaCodecInfo.CodecCapabilities capabilities   codecInfo.getCapabilitiesForTypemimeType     for int i  0 i lt capabilities.colorFormats.length i           if isRecognizedFormatcapabilities.colorFormats[i]              colorFormat  capabilities.colorFormats[i]             break                    return colorFormat    private boolean isRecognizedFormatint colorFormat      switch colorFormat       these are the formats we know how to handle for this test     case MediaCodecInfo.CodecCapabilities.COLORFormatYUV420Planar     case MediaCodecInfo.CodecCapabilities.COLORFormatYUV420PackedPlanar     case MediaCodecInfo.CodecCapabilities.COLORFormatYUV420SemiPlanar     case MediaCodecInfo.CodecCapabilities.COLORFormatYUV420PackedSemiPlanar     case MediaCodecInfo.CodecCapabilities.COLORTIFormatYUV420PackedSemiPlanar     return true     default     return false       codepre

Im trying to use reactrouter with stores as singletons to retrieve information but Im having trouble in deciding where to place my applications states. Im considering the following optionsp  ol liThe root component in my app receives the parameters from the router, gets the objects from the stores and then passes them on to its children, and the them to their children and so on.li liEach component making use of the object receives the parameters from the router and looks for the objects in the stores saving them in their state.li liThe root component receives the parameters from the router and sets the current object in the store. Then each component in need of the current object just asks for it to the store again, saving it in its initial state.li ol  pThe first one seems to be more in line with react practices, though if the component tree is very deep it can get messy and middle component that dont make use of the object would need to handle it. The other two differ in the use of the parameters sent by the router the third one uses them only in the root component.p

The class is defined as followsp  precodeclass sparsematrixcsr      public         sparsematrixcsr         sparsematrixcsrconst stdvectorltintgt amprowindices         sparsematrixcsrconst stdvectorltintgt amprowindices, const sizet nbcolumns           other member functions omitted      private         stdvectorltintgt rowindices         stdvectorltintgt rowstartindices         stdvectorltintgt columnindices         stdvectorltdoublegt values         bool columnsortedbyindex  codepre  pThe coderowindicescode vector contains the indices of the rows of the matrix. coderowstartindicescode contains the index of the first element of a given row in the codecolumnindicescode, which contains the column indices, and codevaluescode vector, which contains the elements of the matrix. In particular, the constructor codesparsematrixcsrconst stdvectorltintgt amprowindices, const sizet nbcolumnscode is implemented as follows p  precodesparsematrixcsrsparsematrixcsrconst stdvectorltintgt amprowindices,                                      const sizet nbcolumns     rowindicesrowindices,     rowstartindicesrowindices.size,     columnindicesrowindices.size  nbcolumns, 0,     valuesrowindices.size  nbcolumns, 0.0,     columnsortedbyindextrue      for sizet i  0 i lt rowstartindices.size i         rowstartindices[i]  i  nbcolumns  codepre  pThis constructor takes in the indices of the rows of the sparse matrix and the number of elements that will be contained in each row. In fact, in the application I am considering, I have same matrices that are sparse only wrt the rows. p  pstrongProblemstrong The algorithm is structured as followsp  precode Instruction block 1       Do something    sparsematrixcsr matlistindices, nbcolumns    Instruction block 2       Do something  codepre  pIf I run the first block of instructions alone commenting out all that follows, my algorithm runs smoothly. However, if I uncomment the second part of the algorithm, the first part of the algorithm slows down a lot. I have been able to identify the critical line for this slowdown in the declaration of codematcode. However, I cannot explain this retroaction on the first part of the algorithm. The full algorithm is reported at the end of my question.p  pstrongMy considerationsstrong I have never observed such a retroaction and therefore I am a little confused. One possibility that I have considered is that I have a problem in memory management which causes the slowdown of the previous part of the algorithm. I am currently working on some matrices that have around 2e6 elements, i.e. around 4e6 values stored in 2 vectors. I read on another post on stack overflow that the data contained in a stdvector are allocated in the heap. Is that always true even if I initialize a vector with a given size as I do in the sparse matrix constructors above p  pIf you need some clarification, do not hesitate p  pThanks in advance,  Pierpaolo p  hr  pFull algorithmp  precodevoid collaborativefilteringmpi stdstring ratingsfile, stdstring targetsfile,                                   stdstring outputfile, int kneighbors, double shrinkagefactor,                                   bool outputdebugdata      stdcout ltlt COLLABORATIVE FILTERING ALGORITHM  k   ltlt kneighbors               ltlt  , d   ltlt shrinkagefactor ltlt stdendl     stopwatch swtotal     swtotal.start    STEP 1 Read data from input files   stdcout ltlt 1 Read input files  stopwatch sw sw.start    1.1 Read user rating matrix    Initialization sparsematrixcsr useritemratingmatrixratingsfile, true, true, true  file is sorted, skip header    1.2 Read targets user, item to be predicted    Initialization sparsematrixcsr targetstargetsfile, true, false, false  do not read ratings column  sw.stop double timeinput  sw.getduration stdcout ltlt  timeinput ltlt stdendl    STEP 2 Precomputations   stdcout ltlt 2 Precomputations  sw.start    2.1 Sort useritemratingmatrixand compute relevant sizes of the problem    Sort if file is sorted, sort should do nothing. useritemratingmatrix.sortcolumnsbyindex   Compute list of users and list of items stdvectorltintgt listusers useritemratingmatrix.rowslistusers stdvectorltintgt listitems useritemratingmatrix.columnslistitems   [DEBUG] print userratingmatrix if outputdebugdata      stdofstream ofsdebugdatadebugdebuguserratingmatrix.txt     ofsdebug ltlt useritemratingmatrix     ofsdebug.close     2.2 Compute inverse user rating matrix indexed by column    Initialize itemuserratingmatrix  it is a sparse matrix with  items on the rows, users on the columns and rating as values.

Negative 1925 pI am hosting PowerShell in a service through which I am running a series of AppFabric cmdlets.  Everything seems to work well for the most part, except that I noticed the creation of log files in my temp directory named DCacheAdministrationemDateandTimeem[emprocessIdem].log.p  pThe only information that I can find about these log files is that they can be controlled by the strongSetAFCacheAdminLoggingstrong and strongClearAFCacheAdminLoggingstrong cmdlets.p  pI could periodically delete these log files so I dont end up with hundreds of thousands of them slowly eating up my disk over time, but I would prefer to suppress their creation all together.

Negative 1925 pIm been brought in to work on an existing CMS and File Management web application that provides a merchant with a management interface for their online webshops. The management application is developed in PHP.p  pWhen the website users are viewing the webshops, the page assets mainly images in nested folder paths are referenced directly from the HTML of the webshops and are served directly from a web server which is separate to the CMS system.p  pBut in order to list  search  allow navigation of the files i.e. the File Management part the CMS application needs to be able to access the filesfolders directory structure.p  pSo we are using Linux NFS mounts to the document file server from the CMS server. This works fairly well if the number of files in any specific merchants directory tree is not too large lt10000. However, some merchants have more than 100000 files in a nested directory tree. Walking this size of tree to get just the directory structure can take more than 120 seconds.p  pRetrieving just the list of files in any one directory is quite fast, but the problem comes when we try to identify which of these files are actually directory entries, so we can recurse down the tree.p  pIt seems that the PHP functions to check the file type either calling isdir on each filepath retrieved with readdir or scandir, or using glob with flag GLOBONLYDIR work on each file individually, not in bulk. So there are now 1000s and 1000s of NFS commands being sent. From my research so far, it seems that this is a limitation of NFS, not of PHP.p  pA stripped down class showing just the function in questionp  precodeclass clImagesDocuments       public dirArr      function getDirsRecursive dir            if  isdir dir               return false                   if  isset thisgtdirArr               thisgtdirArr  glob dir . , GLOBONLYDIR           else              thisgtdirArr  arraymerge thisgtdirArr, glob dir . , GLOBONLYDIR               return false                   for i  0 i lt sizeof thisgtdirArr  i               thisgtgetDirsRecursive thisgtdirArr [i]                    for i  0 i lt sizeof thisgtdirArr  i               indexArr  explode dir, thisgtdirArr [i]              tempDir[indexArr[1]]  thisgtdirArr [i]                   thisgtdirArr  tempDir       codepre  pExecuting the same PHP code to retrieve the directory tree etc locally on the file document server is much, much faster 2 or 3 orders of magnitude, presumably because the local filesystem is caching the directory structure.  I am forced to think that my problem is due to NFS.p  pIm considering writing a simple webapp which will run on the file document webserver and provide realtime lookups of the directory structure via an API.p  pId appreciate any thoughts or suggestions.p

Negative 1925 pThis was my original question, but it was not answered and so I thought Id post again with some of the strategies that I have tried, and be a little more specific.p  pI want to create a dynamic admin site, that based on if the field is blank or not will show that field.  So I have a model that has a set number of fields, but for each individual entry will not contain all of the fields in my model and I want to exclude based on if that field is blank.  My project is about bridges, and so to put it in practical terms I have a model that has every bridge part in it this roughly is equivalent to 100, but each individual bridge mapped to each unique brkey will not have all 100 bridge parts.  And so, I can prepopulate all of the fields it does have, but then the admin site has 100 other fields, and I would like to not display those fields that were not used on my admin site for that specific bridge, but those fields will differ with pretty much every bridge.p  pLike I said before, I  have a unique bridge identifiera unique 15 digit string, that correlates to each bridge, and then all of the various different variables that describe the bridge.p  pI have it set up now that the user will go to a url with the unique bridgekey and then this will create an entry of that bridge.  So as i am testing on my local machine it would be like localhosthomeembrkeyem and that code in my views.py that corresponds to that url is p  pIs this a final route that I have to take  I am very new to JavaScript and so I do not want to take this route but I will if I have to.  Also does Django use Javascript in anyway that is syntactically different  If so I cannot find any Django documentation on incorporating Javascript into my admin site.p  pA final option that I have exhausted is to use global variables.  Instead of having the url that creates the entry in my Views.py, I placed it in my admins.py, and had my modelAdmin class in there as well, so like this.p  padmins.pyp  pset up global variablep  pbridgekeyunique   p  pIf I can find a way to either pass that unique bridge key to my modelAdmin class, or figure out if that said field is blank because the bridge doesnt have that part, I will be able to achieve what I want without using Javascript.  I have tried a lot of variations of all two of theses strategies to no avail, but have not tried the JavaScript idea as I dont really know any javascript at all.p  pSorry for the lengthy post, but people said I wasnt specific enough.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.p

Thats the same for TableBs case. One of the cunning point of these insert operation is, that TableA has the 1toN relation to TableBs records.p  pNow I wanted to achieve it by the simple query, like thisp  precodeINSERT INTO TableC    Column01, Column02, Column03 ...  SELECT    TableA.ColA, TableA.ColB, 0 ... FROM TableA codepre  pBut I also have heard that I can use Cursor to iterate TableB within the loop of TableA...p  pIs there any way to solve this I have read several TSQL and SQL Server programming books, but none of them were describing such a query for badlydesigned tables, just simple SQL basics.p  pI know its not so complicated question, but Im new to the Stored Procedure and TSQL, and I dont know where to start.p  pThanks.p

Negative 1925 pSo Im beginning to learn the basics of Grand Central Dispatch and the whole concept of multithreading with iOS applications. Every tutorial will tell you that you must run UI events on the main thread, but I dont completely understand why. p  pHeres a problem I came across yesterday, and finally fixed it by running a segue on the main thread, but I still dont understand why running it off the main thread was a problemp  pI had a custom initial VC barcode scanner and a segue to a new view controller with a codeUIWebViewcode attached. As soon as the VC found a barcode, it called a handler, and in that closure, I had a codeperformSegueWithIdentifiercode. However, I got a codeEXCBADACCESScode because of this it didnt happen when the second VC had a label or a codeUIImageViewcode, just with codeUIWebViewcode. I finally realized that for some reason, the closure was called off the main thread, and thus the segue was being performed off the main thread. Why exactly would performing the segue on another thread throw a memory error Is it because codeselfcode in codeself.performSegueWithIdentifiercode was somehow nil And why wouldnt Swift automatically dispatch a segue event on the main threadp

Negative 1925 pI have two different webpages the second of which is accessible through a link found on the first page. When the second page is done loading, a large AJAX request is initialized Can take over 30 seconds for the response because the data is coming from a huge and slow database. While that ajax response is pending, if the user opens a new tab and enters the url of one of my two webpages, neither will load until after that 30 second ajax call from the original page is done loading. p  pThis is problematic because the initial load time of the first page is ignoring the ajax request normally is instantaneous and now it is being drawn out to 30 seconds in the worst case scenario. p  pAny help is appreciated Thanks in advancep

Negative 1925 pI am working on a project where I have a medium sized list with anywhere between 10 and 30 items which I am iterating through.  There is a large list of criteria that is used to sort this list.  In simple terms, I have 5 categories, each of which two counters that tick based off the status of the item.  This is simple for me to do, with either codeSwitchcodecodeCasecode or just a more basic codeIfcodecodeElseIfcode.  What makes this problem more difficult, and in my opinion worthy of outside input, is that each item has a date attached to it, and only 3 items per month should be counted.p  pMy approach to this would be to set up a counter for each month, and then start to ignore items that fall within that month, but I am sure there is a smarter and fancier way to do this and some additional experience would be wonderful insight.p  pHere is some code to show what I am doing nowp  precodeFor Each item In List     If item.Category  category1 Then         If item.status  status1 Then             category1Status1  1         Else             category1Status2  1         End If      ElseIf item.Category  category2 Then         If item.status  status1 Then             category2Status1  1         Else             category2Status2  1         End If      ElseIf item.Category  category3 Then         If item.status  status1 Then             category3Status1  1         Else             category3Status2  1         End If      More of this looping      End If Next codepre  pEDIT  Perhaps that it would be helpful to note that i can access the date of the item via codeitem.Datecodep

what was done here is make bigger the square, adjust some left and right values, nothing solid...p  pSomeone told me to use media queries, but i havent worked with them so much... Whats needed is to make the grid resposive, and also dynamic, the purpose is to make it work with AngularJS using an ngrepeat, so that we wont know the number of options, and it will order them to make them view nice. Also would like to know how to do some other stuff like insert an image in the middle of the hex, display an image on top of the name of the hex, and maybe display some info with an animation... p

The app that is built with that codebase is working free of problems under Windows XP.p  pUpon customer request we deployed the app to Windows 7 x64 machines. After that we came across with random crash issues in release build when we try to start the app. App consumes nearly 2GB of memory when it crashes. If we change app compatibility to Windows XP SP3, the crash problem goes away. Also crash never happens in debug mode.p  pWe collected some logs about crash issue. Below logs are givenbr 1.

Negative 1925 pI have a property called SelectedSections that is assigned from a collection of Sections. Each Section holds a collection of BidItems that contains 1,000 items in it. When I select a Section, I need to refresh my collection of items that the view is databound to, with a filtered set of items.p  precodepublic Section SelectedSection      get                return selectedSection            set               this.SetPropertyByReferenceref this.selectedSection, value          if value  null                      this.BidItems  value.BidItems                 .Whereitem gt                      item.Description.ToLower.Containsflagger                      item.Description.ToLower.Containscivilian flagger                      item.Description.ToLower.Containslaw enforcement                 .ToList                   this.MptPayment.EditedItem.DiaryPayItem.Section  value       codepre  pI have to filter out about a dozen or so different types of items I only show 3 for clarity sake. In my codeWherecode clause, I am converting everything to lower case before I check if the collection holds what Im filtering out or not.p  pI realize this is going to generate a lot of garbage, as every one of the 1,000 items in the collection will have a new string created for the lowercase codeDescriptioncode content. My question is, would doing this a dozen times for every item in the collection be more expensive than my just checking all of the known variations Disregarding the fact that I might miss a variation as Im more interested in the theory of which is faster.p  ol liFlaggerli liflaggerli liFLAGGERli ol  pThe above list are all of the known variations. Im wondering which would be the more expensive route to go. Iterating over the collection to check each of the known conditions would be fast enough, without the overhead of generating so much garbage. Its either, enumerate more than once per itemdescription in order to find them all, or enumerate once per itemdescription while creating garbage strings on the heap along the way that will be GCd.p  pNote that this property could be reset several dozen times as the user performs their work. So a lot tens of thousands of string comparisons will be performed.p  pI realize this is a cheap operation relative to the rest of the app Im wanting to know more for educating myself rather than worrying about a performance hit in my actual application.p

Negative 1925 pIm creating a virtual piano on codepen as practice, and am trying to find a way to write one jQuery function that will play a different sound based on which key is clicked.  I created all the keys as list items in an ordered list, and gave them each an id based on what note they are.  Ive figured out how to play the sound based on the note pressed, and I technically could copy the code for each note, but I wanted to practice making my code more compact.  This is what I have so farp  precodeli     .mousedownfunction     noteC[0].play        .mouseupfunction     noteC[0].pause      noteC.propcurrentTime,0    codepre  pI tried adding codevar c  noteC[0]code into the script and codeltli classivory idC datanotecgtCltligtcode. I thought there might be some way of triggering it by linking each sound to its list item, so that when the list item is clicked on, JS knows which sound to play. How can I achieve thatp

Negative 1925 pI am developing a game for iPhones, and am having trouble with a levels screen that I am generating dynamically. I have a scrollview that contains a bunch of level pack buttons, which gets added to my view controllers main view. I make the scrollview the width of the screen, and everything is fine and dandy.p  pWhen I run the app everything works perfectly. However, after anywhere from 130 seconds, the scrollview will magically decide to halve its width, and I have absolutely no idea why.p  pI have tried overriding codeviewDidLayoutSubviewscode and hardcoding the width there, but that doesnt work. Also, when I run the app, I do literally nothing to it. I dont even touch the phone itself, and the scrollview will change size, so I have no idea what could even be triggering the scrollview to change size in the first place.p  pHas anyone even heard of or had this bug before If so, do you know how to fix itp  pThanks in advance.p
